Recently I have seen some great discussion on this subreddit and it sounds like there are a lot of people who are just starting into meditation and coming here for advice or to share some of their experiences.  Great.  I wanted to put together a post that sums up some of the lessons that I have learned along the way in hopes that someone will find it useful.

First a little bit about me.  I started ""meditating"" when I was very young and I couldn't sleep at night my mother told me to do some really basic breathing exercises that were just very simple meditation.  In fact, so don't be discouraged if vipassana or zazen doesn't work for you.  That said...

... don't give up easily.  Frankly the first few days or weeks or months of meditation kinda suck.  And sometimes even the people who have meditated every day for years go through spells where it isn't easy.  Legs cramp, I did at least)....  There are a hundred little problems that you'll face off at first and some will be a constant struggle.  Don't give up.  Expect them and know that it is part of the practice.  Here are some common problems/questions people have.

""I can't shut down my brain.""  Good!  You aren't supposed to and you never will.  No one, ways to move past compulsive and obsessive thoughts.  Here are a few to try:  Acknowledge the thought.  Let it happen.  Why were you thinking that?  Why can't you stop thinking that?  As you meditate you will learn become somewhat of a mechanic with your own brain. There is value in wondering why you think the things you think when you are sitting and isolated, but if you are compulsively turning a thought over and over in your mind you'll probably need another technique.  Like focusing on your breath, a mantra, visualization, etc.  One technique I've found particularly useful is to focus on the negative space between thoughts and make it larger.  If you think the two thoughts:  ""my leg itches"" and ""god my cat is cute"" there is a very small space of nothingness between those two thoughts.  Make that gap larger and larger.  

""When I meditate I feel like I need to....""  sneeze, .... Sitting for a long time it is amazing the bodily needs that suddenly crop up.  There are two very distinct schools of thought on this.  Some people believe you just need to tough it out.  These impulses are the restlessness of the mind manifesting in the body and trying to get you to break your focus.  I advocate the other school of that which is to simply scratch your nose and pick up where you left off.  Yes, it does detract from the experience of meditating to squirm and if you can't make it five minutes without scratching an itch or coughing maybe you should try enduring it.  But a comfortable body does help the mind focus.

""how should I sit?"" The best answer I have is however is comfortable

""Woah I saw the northern lights riding Hunter Thompson and felt warm inside like lasagna.""  Yes.  While meditating you will experience really strange things sometimes.  The experiences are usually interesting, and sometimes horrific. Some people will tell you to analyze the shit out of these and think that they are deeply symbolic and path to enlightenment... I will not give that advice, I don't mean to step on toes here but I am a firm believer in the weird experiences your brain makes for you while in deep meditation are every bit as much of a distraction as the itch on your nose.  Acknowledge it happened, go ahead and say ""woah,"" but move on with your practice.  The deep mind can offer some thrilling spectacles, but the benefits of meditation come from the silence not the noise.

""Enlightenment.""  Forget about it.  Even if you want ""enlightenment"" from meditating do not even think the damn word.  It just infects your practice and you think every blissful moment has some much greater meaning than it does.  I cringe whenever people talk about the subject and certainly as someone just starting into meditation focus on sitting and breathing

""Can I meditate while I...""  Yes.  You can meditate while you do just about anything (except sleep, no doing the dishes, no playing tribes.  But, by all means, experiment with being ""in the moment"" in your day to day life.  The greatest pleasure from meditation is how mundane routine can suddenly become pleasurable and rich.  

""will meditation give me superpowers?""  No.  There is a lot of misinformation out there about the benefits of meditation, stay calmer, have a decreased chance of a few diseases....  Most people who meditate and have meditated for a long period of time do it because it is an enjoyable experience.  Try it out.  Stick with it through the first few weeks or months where your legs cramp and your brain feels awkward.  I think you'll conclude the same.

1373387542.0,1hxynt,Mindfulness Meditation Explained - How to stop identifying with negative thoughts.,inquiringmindsfap,356,50,49,"Edit:  I wrote this for my mother

Not identifying with negative thoughts: 
 
 
You have to start by separating your TRUE SELF from your thoughts and your feelings.  Your psyche is constructed of 3 entities:   the first is the animal side, you don’t think about breathing, you just breathe.  So the animal side of yourself (called the “Id” in psychology) carries out your normal functions like eating, sleeping, and seeking comfort.  You are hard-wired to do these things, which do not require active thought. 
 
The second entity in your psyche is the thinker.  The “thinker” is the side of your psyche which creates thoughts. In psychology it’s called the “ego”.  The purpose of the ego is to give your sense of self a form… it creates the person you think you are.  If you think about the question “who am I?”, I am a fighter, I am an American, I am tall, I am active, I am extroverted, I am this, vices
It says, so you don’t wear pink hair.  Remember the phrase “you are who you say you are”?  This is true on many levels, and is the mechanism through which your ego creates that persona.  
 
The third entity is called “your true or higher self”.  Your true self is who you really are.  In other words,  this is your true self realizing that your ego is being negative, and it’s turning around according to what it wants (to look for positive aspects).   Your true self is also the entity which is attuned to your spiritual side.  Furthermore, your true self does not have thoughts.  It simply observes, and acts according to your inner nature.  Everybody is born with a hard-wired set of morals.  Across all races and religions we observe things like “murder is wrong” and “stealing is wrong”.  It is your higher self which motivates you to act in accordance to those morals. 
 
Just remember that the ego is the entity which applies WORDS and LABELS to everything around you. It also applies JUDGMENTS.  In other words, it is neither good nor bad. It’s your ego’s negative judgment that makes it good or bad.  This concept applies universally to all things that surround you.  Your ego makes things good or bad. Your ego predisposes you to your moods, and it tells your mind and your body how to digest the things that happen to you.  
 
Now, not your true self.  As a matter of fact, there is a huge power struggle between the ego and the true self.  The ego wants power, it wants to be in control.  It gains control through your thoughts and judgments.  It subconsciously makes judgments on your behalf.  It predisposes you to act in accordance to its will, and makes you live out your life according to the persona it created.  
 
Almost every religion in the world… the three monotheistic relgions, ancient indigenous religions, new age spirituality, even secular humanism… all of these have one thing in common, have one unified goal.  This goal is essentially to discover your true self by transcending the ego.  To transcend literally means “to go through, rise above, to exceed, the teachings of Christ encourage us to love others as we love ourselves
 
Everybody has an innate need to discover themselves as part of the universe.  As in, in order to discover your TRUE nature and self.  When you discover your true self, you also discover your place in the universe.  You cannot discover your true self without transcending the ego.  When you transcend the ego, you empower your true self, and take that power away from the ego.  Our purpose is to dominate it, and align it with the intentions of our higher self.  
 
So we come back to the first part:  how to separate yourself from your thoughts and feelings.  This involves separating your higher self from your ego.  The Power of Now is a great guide on how to do this.  But we can boil it down through these steps: 
1.       Start by being in the present moment. Don’t think about the past or the future.  You are here now, it does not think.   Being in the present moment allows you to distinguish your thoughts.   
2.       Distinguish your thoughts.  Take the first thought that comes to mind: “I have a headache and I’m in a bad mood”.   Your goal is to deconstruct those thoughts
a.       I have a headache– this is your body experiencing this
b.      I’m in a bad mood – this is your ego responding to the pain your body is feeling. 
c.       Bad – this is the label that your ego is applying to the present moment. 
3.       When you have a firm grip on distinguishing your thoughts and deconstructing them, without it being good or bad.  I will simply allow it to be, and I will stop my mind from reacting negatively.”   
a.       If you are not experienced, this process becomes automatic, like breathing.  
b.      So about your headache:   It is there.  It is not good
 
This process of thought deconstruction will show the ego for what it really is – a false sense of self.  Once you are able to strip away this false sense of self, and notice where the thoughts come from.  Notice the labels you apply to everything, and notice your desires.  
 
Once you notice yourself applying judgment to everything that surrounds you, you recognize that the characters are employees in costumes, and the castles are just plaster and don’t have real kings and queens.   Whenever you apply judgment to your experience, Disneyland looks “real”.   Once you deconstruct the judgment and realize that it comes from your egoic need believe in fairytales, then you no longer have a need to believe in the fairytales.  That need goes away because you discover your true self – and your true self does not need to believe in stories to deal with reality. Your true self looks for the truth – your ego wants to believe in the fairytales because it can’t cope with reality.  
 
So this is the basic process for “not identifying with negative thoughts”.    Hope you can benefit from it.  
 
One more note I’d like to add:   I noticed that whenever it’s that time of the month, I FEEL like I am depressed or in a bad mood.  It does not actually mean I am depressed, but it just feels like I am.  I have actually witnessed my ego scramble to tie that bad feeling to something – “It must be because I’m bad at doing something, or because I made some sort of mistake, or because my life seems out of place”.   But I have stopped allowing my ego to tie the bad feeling to anything.  I simply recognize “It’s that time of the month, and I’m having a hormonal reaction. I am absolutely fine, and everything is okay”.   
 
If you can learn to listen to your body, or your mood is going to improve.  It just simply means that you don’t have to agonize over it, you don’t have to let it affect your wellbeing.  You’re okay, and it’s just a thought.

And there's something you notice with people who are beginning meditation. They naturally have a lot of questions. Some people don't have a lot of questions, it can become clear that this ""not trusting one's own mind"" is something that runs deeply. There's some reason to doubt our minds' capacities in a lot of situations, but meditation is just your mind minding itself -- how is it that we can go astray even with this?

I think that even if meditation isn't exactly like any other skill, it's all just about being in the world, and all practices have stuff in common. So if you look at how you approach other skills, it might show you something about how you're approaching meditation.

And here I think there's one particular thing which is so obvious

This is something that our whole culture is just massively stupid about in a lot of ways. Look at school. Most people hate going to school because it's all just about learning and succeeding. It's pure discouragement. The underlying lesson is ""don't trust your own mind.""

And so a lot of people acquire this basic underlying defeatism, why would I write? I'm never going to give a TED talk, so why should I think?

And look at music. It's a basic social beautiful activity, but we're literally sending children to prison because they download recordings of pop songs from the internet? We curate our music tastes, get further and further into obscure genres, because our whole basic approach to the thing is consumptive, but we still need to somehow excel.

What's up with all this crap?

Some people say ""you're perfect exactly the way you are, or a vacuous cliché. ""You possess the innate wisdom of the radiant Buddha-nature."" Hah, how pompous!

Try asking an non-artistic adult if they can draw a realistic horse. This just *kills* people. It's embarrassing to fail, just find a picture of a horse, and try to make marks on a paper so it looks like the picture. Maybe it will be hard to get it right. So what?!?

I think this is something brothers and sisters often try to help each other with. ""Come on! Don't be a sissy! Just try it!"" There's something in sibling relationships that can come across as mean

So, you can say it's about confidently just *taking one breath*. Taking one breath as if you trusted your own mind.

What happens when you just breathe? Read that question as a question from one brother to another, unless you don't trust your own mind. How will you know if you're ""just breathing?"" DON'T ASK! I don't know! You're the only one who can know that. You're the one who's driving. ",,False,self,t5_2qnc9,False,,

&gt;Our human perceptual habits are remarkably stupid in some ways. We tune out 99% of all the sensory stimuli we actually receive, and they are turned into scintillating electronic stimulations within the nervous system. The process is beautiful and fulfilling in itself. We humans tend to ignore it totally. Instead, we solidify that perception into a mental object. We paste a mental picture on it and we launch into a series of emotional and conceptual reactions to it. ""There is that dog again. He is always barking at night. What a nuisance. Every night he is a real bother. Somebody should do something. Maybe I should call a cop. No, a dog catcher. So, I'll call the pound. No, maybe I'll just write a real nasty letter to the guy who owns that dog. No, too much trouble. I'll just get an ear plug."" They are just perceptual and mental habits. You learn to respond this way as a child by copying the perceptual habits of those around you. These perceptual responses are not inherent in the structure of the nervous system. The circuits are there. But this is not the only way that our mental machinery can be used. That which has been learned can be unlearned. The first step is to realize what you are doing, and stand back and quietly watch.

This caused me to close my eyes and let the music I was listening to wash over me and with some new found clarity I experienced one of the most beautiful experiences. I felt my new found knowledge dissolving barriers that have been in place for thirty years and experienced this gorgeous music with freshly opened eyes.

**I would eat exactly one jellybean a day


Normally, instead, I take a few minutes to savor a single bean, giving it my full attention. I get more enjoyment from that one bean than I used to from the whole bag.


Every day after breakfast


* I look it over and take in all the minute visual details. There’s actually a ton to see. The bean isn’t perfectly rounded — it’s got planes and irregularities. The surface usually has small dings from being knocked around a bag with other jellybeans. Without too much inner monologue, or splotchy? Are they evenly spread out, or clumped into patches? Is the bean opaque, or jewel-like and translucent? I hold it up to the sunlight for a second — what does that look like? It’s actually pretty enthralling when you start looking this closely, seeing all the details you’d never even thought to look for before.


* I feel the bean between my fingers. Is it cool? Is it hard or a little yielding? Is it leaving a residue on my fingers?


* I smell the bean. What’s that like? Does it just smell sweet


* Eventually, I take a few seconds to feel what the bean is like on my tongue. I knock it around my mouth and hear it clack against my teeth. I notice the surface of the bean getting rough and sandpapery as my saliva dissolves the candy coating. Then I bite down and pay attention to the gush of flavor that washes over my tongue. (That part is awesome.) As I chew, I feel my jaw working, hear the chewing sounds, and also watch the flavor sort of evolve and intensify, hit a peak, then start fading into aftertaste. It’s a surprisingly epic ride.


And that's my Jelly Belly meditation. It’s fun, but it definitely is a meditative practice. For me, it's a nice supplement to sitting and a sorta lighthearted way to bring more mindfulness into my daily routine.

Throughout the day, the farther from reality I get and the worse I feel. And because my mind is in a state of disarray, I will often get deep into these ruminations without even realizing I'm doing it.

A good example of a recurring rumination of mine is self-improvement. I'll think of all the ways I could be, it's more likely to hurt. I'll lower my self-esteem by criticizing myself for not being this ideal person I think I should be. And then I'll build up a new ideal which I intend to achieve and which is inevitably completely unrealistic and unreachable.

One day the topic of discussion was the difference between acting and observing internal states.  It was within this context that the Dhamma instructor dropped this knowledge bomb:

&gt; Anything you can observe is not you.

From external objects, if I can experience it, then it is a transient object separate from myself.  This naturally leads to the question of ""what is myself"" which is something I can't really answer within this framework.

I immediately started feeling all kinds of stress symptoms but I managed to hold my concentration and just sort of ""watched"" the effect it had on my body. It felt so great afterwards to become so much more aware of the effect stress has on my body (I normally feel so cut off from myself) and to be able to identify my mother as a source of stress (it's not a dysfunctional relationship but I think there are some issues).

I've just had another session during my lunch break at my graveyard shift at work, ending in a pain in my stomach which slowly faded away.

Then it occurred to me one day

At some point

But then I remembered back to the times before the anxieties.

If there was a ""before""

Which means I can unlearn them.

I started writing about my fears. It was **integral** for me overcoming them.

Step 1: Write down your fears. Let everything out. You are the only one thats going to read it

After you've written, and you end up exposing them as baseless and/or blown waaay out of porportion.  I've found myself laughing sometimes at some of my thoughts.

Step 2: Meditate deeply after writing and come to that place of infinite peace.  I remind myself as I am in this peace, and will be there after I get over them.  

Realizing that this place of peace was always with me, is how I got my life back.

I may still have a few remnant anxious thoughts from time to time, do [square breathing](http://dharmaineverywave.com/square-breathing/), and I remind myself ""These are your attachments"".  This is incredibly important to realize.

As time went on, you stop thinking of them at all.  And thats when you have detached fully.

Can we really ""not think""? Obviously, can we? Can we walk, see, feel, speak if we are not thinking? Can we understand when we are not thinking? But that's the point of meditation, to understand and to ""not think"". How is that possible?

What is a thought? I don't know... That's what I was concentrating on not doing during meditation... But what was I doing during meditation? I was trying to repress my inner monologue, an inner monologue, a speech. That is a... *formalised thought*.

And suddenly I understood it whole. That inner voice that we so often call a ""thought"" isn't a thought at all! That inner voice speaks when we read, absorb information, not create it. 

That's it! I know now what a *thought* is. The thinking, but we don't controll it! We slow it down by formalising it into words and images, to give a form to allow our conciousness to understand it, but we don't have to do that, and that's the point of meditation: To *open* our minds to the world, our subconcious minds. The conciousness, the ego, but we get confused and we think this is who we are

Speed reading is exactly that! From young age we are taught to vocalise each letter inside our heads! But if we let go of that inner voice and just absorb the words without these so called ""thoughts""

That's the point of meditation, understand it, then speak it, then hear it and *then* process it in our minds again, while we can simply stop on the very first step! The same is with thinking. If we are able to shut our inner voice, our imagination and our ego, we can obtain our raw, completly and instantenously - *That* is enlightenment.

when I was a young man 
I felt these things were 
dumb
I had bad blood
mind
upbringing. 

I was hard as granite
leered at the 
sun. 
I trusted no man and 
especially no 
woman. 

I was living a hell in 
small rooms
things
walked through glass
cursed. 
I challenged everything
was continually being 
evicted
out of fights
of my mind. 
women were something 
to screw and rail 
at
freinds

I changed jobs and 
cities
babies
newspapers
grandmothers
marriage
spiders
english accents
france
the color 
orange. 
algebra angred me
opera sickened me
charlie chaplin was a 
fake 
and flowers were for 
pansies. 

peace an happiness to me 
were signs of 
inferiority
tenants of the weak 
an 
addled 
mind. 

but as I went on with 
my alley fights
my suicidal years
my passage through 
any number of 
women-it gradually 
began to occur to 
me 
that I wasn't different 

from the 
others

they were all fulsome 
with hatred
glossed over with petty 
greivances
the men I fought in 
alleys had hearts of stone. 
everybody was nudging
inching
some insignificant 
advantage
the lie was the 
weapon and the 
plot was 
empty
darkness was the 
dictator. 

cautiously
myself to feel good 
at times. 
I found moments of 
peace in cheap 
rooms 
just staring at the 
knobs of some 
dresser 
or listening to the 
rain in the 
dark. 
the less I needed 
the better I 
felt. 

maybe the other life had worn me 
down. 
I no longer found 
glamour 
in topping somebody 
in conversation. 
or in mounting the 
body of some poor 
drunken female 
whose life had 
slipped away into 
sorrow. 

I could never accept 
life as it was
i could never gobble 
down all its 
poisons 
but there were parts
tenous magic parts 
open for the 
asking. 

I re formulated 
I don't know when
date
that 
but the change 
occured. 
something in me 
relaxed
out. 
i no longer had to 
prove that I was a 
man

I did'nt have to prove 
anything. 

I began to see things: 
coffee cups lined up 
behind a counter in a 
cafe. 
or a dog walking along 
a sidewalk. 
or the way the mouse 
on my dresser top 
stopped there 
with its body
its ears
its nose
it was fixed
a bit of life 
caught within itself 
and its eyes looked 
at me 
and they were 
beautiful. 
then- it was 
gone. 

I began to feel good
I began to feel good 
in the worst situations 
and there were plenty 
of those. 
like say
behind his desk
he is going to have 
to fire me. 

I've missed too many 
days. 
he is dressed in a 
suit, 
he says
to have to let you go' 

'it's all right' I tell 
him. 

He must do what he 
must do
wife
expenses
a girlfreind. 

I am sorry for him 
he is caught. 

I walk onto the blazing 
sunshine. 
the whole day is 
mine 
temporailiy
anyhow. 

(the whole world is at the 
throat of the world
everybody feels angry
short-changed
everybody is despondent
dissillusioned) 

I welcomed shots of 
peace
happiness. 

I embraced that stuff 
like the hottest number
like high heels
singing
works. 

(dont get me wrong
there is such a thing as cockeyed optimism 
that overlooks all 
basic problems just for 
the sake of 
itself- 
this is a shield and a 
sickness.) 

The knife got near my 
throat again
I almost turned on the 
gas 
again 
but when the good 
moments arrived 
again 
I did'nt fight them off 
like an alley 
adversary. 
I let them take me
i luxuriated in them
I bade them welcome 
home. 
I even looked into 
the mirror 
once having thought 
myself to be 
ugly
I now liked what 
I saw
handsome
a bit ripped and 
ragged
scares
odd turns
but all in all
not too bad
almost handsome
better at least than 
some of those movie 
star faces 
like the cheeks of 
a baby's 
butt. 

and finally I discovered 
real feelings of 
others
unheralded
like lately
like this morning
as I was leaving
for the track
i saw my wife in bed
just the 
shape of 
her head there 
(not forgetting 
centuries of the living 
and the dead and 
the dying
the pyramids
Mozart dead 
but his music still 
there in the 
room
the earth turning
the toteboard waiting for 
me) 
I saw the shape of my 
wife's head
she so still
I ached for her life
just being there 
under the 
covers. 

I kissed her in the
forehead
got down the stairway
got outside
got into my marvelous 
car
fixed the seatbelt
backed out the 
drive. 
feeling warm to 
the fingertips
down to my 
foot on the gas 
pedal
I entered the world 
once 
more
drove down the 
hill 
past the houses 
full and empty 
of 
people
I saw the mailman
honked
he waved

I'd like to start this post with a disclaimer. I *know* that meditation is not a self help technique and in the traditional sense the whole idea is not to expect or work at anything. **I completely understand that meditation is about just being.** What I wonder though, and to me personally.  

Recently, but last night I got stopped and had to do all the tests. I blew into the breathalizer and I passed just fine, but I felt shaken by it nonetheless. My life would've come crashing down with a DUI and the saftey of others is very important to me as well.

I know this fact


In an effort to become more self-aware I've been meditating daily for two months

Honestly I think I understand how it all fits together: we suffer because we're attached and running on autopilot

So I guess in this small rant I've now put you all through what I'm wondering is this: Has meditation helped you do align with who you really are by allowing you to handle situations as you want

1370161642.0,1fiepd,I can easily say that meditation has changed my perspective on life.,yeahkeogh,163,16,34,"Months back, about 50% or more of my thought process through out the day was either ""kill yourself"" or something like ""life is pointless

Along with lots of cannabis, but I didn't stop practicing it, after a while I definitely felt a change in my mood. Its been little over two months of the practice and already my head has gone from a grey, dull trashcan of depression and anxiety to this vast field of colors and positive energy. 

Anxiety really took me away from life, it reeled me back into the present. If my day starts to fade into depression, my first instinct is to just sit down and let it happen. I try to make myself and the depression as contrasting as possible so I can get a real firm understanding on what I'm feeling. As I focus on the sudden growing depression in my day, it starts to not seem like depression but instead just an object of observation. I have no negative feelings towards depression now, when it happens I simply say to myself in my head ""This is depression"" or ""This is anxiety"" and instead of feeling overwhelmingly awful about these grey experiences I feel absolutely normal mentally, and the depression and anxiety I know are just an illness, I am not my illness

Aside from eliminating my depression and anxious feelings towards life, a few slow deep breaths and I'm slowly brought into this calm, peaceful realm. It's as if I am shrunken down to the size of an atom, and placed inside my thoughts. I find myself in this massive landscape, I want to say it is endless but I dare not to make that exploration until I have reached a higher state of mind. Anyway, back to this landscape, which is not much of a landscape at all; but a universe of a higher dimension inhabited by these strange dream-like creatures of this almost liquid electricity. Along with these entities I notice massive geometric patterns beyond human comprehension. I could not explain these patterns if I devoted my life to explaining them. 

After observing this vast comfortable landscape, just stricken by massive amounts of euphoria. I feel so safe in these stages, and if by some wild turn of events in my physical life my body is injured or destroyed, I feel as if the universe would not let me parish into a sea of black for eternity, I feel as if the universe is trustful enough that I do not need to worry about death, or what comes after, just as long as I have my feet on firm ground and I have a strong grip on the present, I am safe no matter what. After all these mindful thoughts that rush past my field of view, but I just felt the need to. After my farewells I witness this strange indescribable entity pulsing back these waves of green purple and pink

I have only had experiences like this twice, and felt the need to further explore the feeling, I sit down and focus on my forehead and I'm suddenly brought into that colorful state.

This got me thinking (the irony), so they don't let themselves feel what they're feeling in that moment because it hurts. Then, they are left in rumination, because the only other option is to feel 'bad' emotions. They are continuously running away from their bodies into their thoughts, and unconsciously are averse to accepting their emotional state in the moment.

I make music with a very strict intention to act as a tool or catalyst for intense meditation and introspection.

Examples of such felt effects are sensations of inward travelling and body separation, inner eye hallucinations, and illuminations of thought, to name a few.


Share your thoughts with me, ambient music or anything else I have encountered, but rather something wholly different.  I am not one for bragging and certainly hope you all can trust me when I say this especially, that this is unlike any other form of music I am aware of.  The best point I can raise in support of this claim is that my initial compulsion to begin this work came from not finding anything like it already in existence.


I have posted my music on other subreddits before in the past


You can find everything I have released [here](http://www.sisterwaize.blogspot.com) along with bits of writing about my music including suggested instructions on how to listen to it and my motivation for making it.

I feel like there is a general misconception regarding the purpose of meditation. While I feel its completely fine and a positive thing to meditate for the enjoyment it brings

The reason one meditates is to take control of his being. To discipline yourself to not rely on the material and external world. You cannot attain self mastery through the usage of an external thing.

Its not because weed is bad. Its not because it damages your mind. Its not because you don't have ligament insights while on weed. You meditate so you can attain liberation from attachments


edit: for those who say I'm being rude. I don't think I am. This is what I believe and is my stance on the argument. You can disagree or agree

edit2: lol its kind of funny how you cant state your opinion without explaining to everybody its only your opinion. Of course I understand this is only my opinion, its an invitation to a discussion.

edit3: I guess my concept of meditation is only the Buddhist concept of it. I figured anyone who meditates did so to get rid of attachment [I know thats why I started] and anyone who didn't at first would soon learn through self observation the benifits of ridding one self of attachment... maybe if they stopped smoking pot while they did it.... lol

last edit: While I stand by my origonal point, I argue with conviction and I do respect the choices you make. But I made this post out of compassion in hopes that anyone who IS seeking self mastery or to get rid of attachment, may realize a useful tool of theirs is another subtler form of attachment.

1355928447.0,153z1g,First Attempt at a very practical meditation roadmap,gerritvb,157,22,32,"###Beginning  
Duration: 1-12 months(??)  
##Concentration - Sitting

Sit in as ideal conditions as possible. Ideal means silence, and no environmental interruptions or distractions ([pdf](http://www.stanford.edu/group/scbs/sztp3/translations/shobogenzo/translations/zazengi/pdf/Zazengi%20translation.pdf) instructions). Focus on the sensation of the air that moves in and our of your nose as you breathe. Do this for 5-30 minutes. 

In this stage, but that’s fine. It’ll help you learn the technique of focused attention. 

##Insight - Real World Practice
Build a habit of “posture checking.” Ideally every 5-10 minutes throughout the day, noting everything about your body position and muscles, like tension, pressure, blood flow, etc. 

The goal is not to correct posture, having this habit established gives them a place to plug into automatically. Think of it as laying out all the ingredients for a meal you will cook, so that it will be faster and easier to prepare the meal without rummaging in cabinets and measuring things.

##How Do I Know It’s Working?

You will notice the “mental monkey.” You will be surprised at how your mind is basically never at rest—thoughts are constantly arising, conversations happening, noises from the outside world breaking your concentration and starting you off on other tangents, etc. If you are noticing this, then this is great progress! Many beginners view this as failure, a sign that they are bad at concentrating. Nope! It means you have finally really observed yourself, maybe for the first time. 

Next is to keep your attention completely focused on the breath without any interruption for one inhale and one exhale. As you practice

###Advanced Beginner  
Duration: 1-12 months ???  
##Concentration - Sitting

Continue sitting as before. For added challenge: (1) increase your goal of how many inhalations / exhalations you want to concentrate for without interruption

This sitting time is **deliberate practice** and is analogous to musicians practicing scales, because conquering failure.

##Insight - Sitting
Begin a sitting routine that focuses on noting, you force your attention to stay on one thing. In insight practice, you want to 

1. sit passively and allow sensations and thoughts to enter your mind 
1. then observe these sensations and thoughts
1. then set them aside by returning to your breath
1. wait for the next sensation to arise naturally and repeat.  

Sometimes you will get sucked in to your thoughts. That’s OK: just return to your attention to your breath and start over.

Feel free to sub vocalize while observing sensations and thoughts

Lastly

1. No-Self. The sensations are not “me.” This is hard to explain. Rain falling on you is obviously “not me,” instead of “I’m feeling frustrated,” to emphasize this disconnect. I welcome others to help me explain this better.
1. Non-permanence. The sensations are fleeting. Everyone knows this analytically, the heat of the moment. The goal of insight practice is to learn this truth intimately.
1. Unsatisfactoriness. The sensations , and clinging to good feelings that are no longer part of this present moment make the present moment pale in comparison to our often rose-colored memory of the past.

##How Do I Know It’s Working?

For concentration:

1. Longer sitting periods with equal concentration
1. You may notice increased ability to focus on real world tasks without trying. You may be less susceptible to distraction. This may be especially pronounced right after you finish a sitting period.

For insight:  

1. You’ll start to notice how many distinct feelings
1. You’ll start to appreciate, non-permanence, and unsatisfactoriness. E.g., you may notice you are more emotionally stable because you no longer invest yourself personally in your moods, or you may be less bothered by annoyances, knowing they are temporary. You may be less caught up in consumption, gossip, knowing they are ultimately not fulfilling because they add nothing to your present experience. 

These will continue to be progress markers as your practice develops.

###The Middle (???)  
Duration: Probably long.  

##Concentration - Sitting
Do not count when sitting

##Insight - Real World Practice
In addition or in place of sitting insight meditation, folding clothes, typing, etc.). Observe your mind forming the intent to move through the activity, the muscles moving, and all sensations that arise from the activity. 

This method is high power, real-life mindfulness.

How Do I Know It’s Working?  
Concentration: You can experience similar levels of concentration during walking meditation as you did during sitting meditation.

Insight: 

1. Your may observe similar depth of mindfulness doing the slow activities as you had achieved in sitting practice. 
2. You may spontaneously experience mindfulness while going about your daily business. 
1.  You may be able to observe sensations without the sub vocalization (e.g., more distant, fainter, or more quick to fade.

###Advanced (???)  
Duration: Indefinitely.  
##Both Concentration &amp; Insight:  
Sync your breath with any activity done at ordinary speed. Focus on the breath

##Insight: 
Observe the processes that give rise to sensations like emotions, not just the sensations themselves. In other words, observe observation itself. This sounds confusing, so it may help to visualize this. The way I think of it, there is a screen that separates me from the world, and that screen is my perception. I do not really experience things; I experience what the screen delivers to my mind (e.g., I can’t see infrared because the screen doesn’t see it; but infrared is still real). The goal here is to observe that screen as it goes about its process of generating sensations. 

##How Do I Know It’s Working?  
You may notice greater concentration and awareness popping up throughout your daily activities. You may be able to seize brief moments of idleness or waiting and turn them into a quick insight sitting

###Expert (???)  
Duration: Indefinitely  

Attempt full concentration and insight during ordinary daily activities done at ordinary speeds. This means full speed, the hypothetical goal is to be fully concentrated and aware at all times, at the same strength as when doing a sitting practice under ideal conditions.

1350751253.0,11swr2,If you reduce meditation to a 'doing' you will miss. ,,161,25,33,"What is meditation? Is it a technique that can be practiced? Is it an effort that you have to do? Is it something which the mind can achieve? It is not.

All that the mind can do cannot be meditation -- it is something beyond the mind, because in our life, whatsoever we do, we do through the mind; whatsoever we achieve, we achieve through the mind. And then, when we turn inwards, we again start thinking in terms of techniques, doings, it has only to be remembered. It is there waiting for you -- just a turning in

Meditation is your intrinsic nature -- it is you, you cannot not have it, it cannot be possessed. It is not a thing. It is you. It is your being.

Once you understand what meditation is things become very clear. Otherwise

Meditation is a state of clarity, when there are no more clouds around you, when you are in your simple beingness, clarity happens. Then you can see far away; then you can see to the very end of existence; then your gaze becomes penetrating -- to the very core of being.

Meditation is clarity, 'You have to drop thinking,' don't conclude in a hurry, because I have to use language. So I say, 'Drop thinking,' but if you start dropping, you will miss

'Drop thinking' simply means: don't do anything. Sit. Let thoughts settle themselves. Let mind drop on its own accord. You just sit gazing at the wall, anywhere. As if you are falling asleep awake -- you are awake and you are relaxing but the whole body is falling into sleep. You remain alert inside but the whole body moves into deep relaxation.
Thoughts settle on their own accord

If somebody has passed through a stream and the dead leaves have surfaced and the mud has arisen, the dead leaves will be taken away, and the mud will start settling because it cannot hang forever.

Try anywhere between 3-10 seconds and if it's too hard, go down as many seconds as you need and if it's too easy, go up as many seconds as you need with the ultimate goal of working up towards more time.

It was at school where I met other kids my own age. Everything seemed alright until I got made fun of. Kids would tease and lie to me. I only had one place to go where I could feel better: my thoughts. As time went on

Once I got into middle school, hoping that it would bring me to some answers. The answers that came sent me further and further into isolation. Eventually all I had was my video games to think about and a few friends I didn't care for.

Everything became a puzzle that needed to be solved by my thoughts. Without realizing it, and it was amazing. I would ultimately choose this drug infused world of thinking over anyone else in my life. People became simple means to an end. The suffering grew worse. It got so bad that I contemplated using an easy, permanent solution: death.

It wasn't until my final experience with LSD that I saw the world for the first time and who I really was. My ego had been doused in potent acid and wouldn't be able to filter reality for a few hours. During this time, I wondered how I would ever get back to this beautiful place of love and awareness. It wasn't but a few days before I stumbled upon something I had tried with no success in the past. This something would be the beginning of my journey into reality. 

This something is called meditation.

I first started meditating (Vipassana or insight meditation) about 14 months ago, ""This is too hard"", and it almost felt like very hard cardiovascular exercise just to sit there meditating. When the alarm came on my phone is always felt like a relief.


These days I sit for 35 minutes twice a day, lol) when I see posts of people seeing no benefits when from meditation WHEN THEY'RE ONLY DOING IT FOR 5 MINUTES A DAY. Well, duh! 5 minutes isn't going to do anything for you. The same as why 5 minutes of running won't do anything for your cardiovascular endurance, or pumping tiny dumbells and expecting massive arms. 


The benefits to my life have been incredible. Stress, words flow from my mouth. When I want to be silent, I am completely comfortable with it (infact one of my friends once said when there was a 15 second silence ""soo.... this is awkward"" I felt nothing of the sort). Approaching girls is also easier (22 year old male) and I feel like I don't need to impress them any more. I am also no longer always slightly depressed - there has been a noticeable shift in ""feel good"" chemicals in my brain, so much so that I no longer classify myself as depressed (daily exercise and omega-3, vitamin supplements would've helped also). 14 months ago I also used to drink every day, I craved atleast a bottle of wine; when I started meditating this craving slowly disappeared after a few months and now I drink once a week and don't crave that or any other drugs. 


Also I think it's understated how Vipassana should be the main recommended form of meditation; I initially learnt it from Mindfulness in Plain English. Also it needs to be stated more on here that being ""present to the moment"" and ""meditating whilst off the cushion"" ala Eckhart Tolle is greatly complementary to Vipassana. Being present has become a main componenet of my daily life. Long walks to a destination? Present. Driving somewhere? Present. Waiting in a Queue? Present. Eating? Present. Waiting to fall asleep? Present.

1334901924.0,sj8xv,A Great Explanation Of Why One Should Meditate,amnadu,135,11,20,"I transcribed an Alan Watts recording where he explained the two main reasons why one should meditate. From *Alan Watts Teaches Meditation*. 


**The First Reason We Meditate – To Get In Touch With Reality**

**""**The art of meditation is a way of getting in touch with reality. The reason for it is that most civilized people are out of touch with reality, there is the real world and on the other a whole system of symbols about that world which we have in our minds. These are very useful symbols all civilization depends on them, but like all good things they have their disadvantages and the principle disadvantage is that we can confuse them with reality. Just as we confuse money with actual wealth. And our names about ourselves, our ideas of ourselves, our images of ourselves, *with* ourselves. Now of course reality from a philosophers point of view is a dangerous word. A philosopher will ask me, “What do I mean by reality? Am I talking about the physical world of nature? Or am I talking about a spiritual world? Or what?” And to that I have a very simple answer - when we *talk* about the material world, that’s also a philosophical concept

Reality is …[he bangs on a gong and we hear the noise resonate for a while]… and we won’t give it a name.

Now it’s amazing what doesn’t exist in the real world. For example, in which we describe things and events in the same way as we would project images on a Rorschach blot or pick out particular groups of stars in the sky and call them constellations as if they were separate groups of stars. Well, they’re groups of stars in the minds’ eye, in our systems of concepts, they are not out there as constellations already grouped in the sky. 

So in the same way the difference between myself and all the rest of the universe is nothing more than an idea

Because, I don’t hear what anyone else has to say, and so in exactly the same way if I think all the time - that is to say if I talk to myself all the time - I don’t have anything to think about except thoughts. And therefore I’m living entirely in the world of symbols and I’m never in relationship with reality.**""**

**The Second Reason We Meditate – There is no Reason**

This is going to be a little bit more difficult to understand. We could say that meditation doesn’t have a reason, except perhaps making music and dancing. Because, when we make music, we don’t do it in order to reach a certain point, such as the end of a composition. If that were the purpose of music, to get to the end of the piece, then obviously the fastest players would be the best. And so likewise, we are not aiming to arrive at a particular place on the floor

Meditation is the discovery that the point of life is always arrived at in the immediate moment. And, to improve your mind, to improve your character, to be more efficient in life – you’ve got your eye on the future and you are not meditating. Because, the future is a concept; it doesn’t exist. As the proverb says, “Tomorrow never comes.” There is no such thing as tomorrow; there never will be, because time is always now. That’s one of the things we discover when we stop talking to ourselves and stop thinking; there is only a present – only an eternal now. 

It’s funny then, ‘for the enjoyment of it,’ and here I would interpose the essential principal that 'meditation is supposed to be fun'. And it’s not something you do as a grim duty. The trouble with religion as  we know it, is that it is so mixed up with grim duties, ‘we do it because it’s good for you; it’s a form of self-punishment’. 

Well, is simply here and now.**""**",,False,self,t5_2qnc9,False,,

1360436995.0,187dih,Some things that help me quiet my mind during sits,goo22,144,25,26,"Hello fellow meditators! just a couple of tips that i think may be helpful in quieting the mind during a meditation that have helped me a lot along the way. They are some techniques mentioned in Eckhart Tolle's books that seemed to help me

When your focusing on your breath but you cant really get in the zone

1 - Notice the absolute silence that pervades the background.  Even if you are meditating in a noisy environment, the silence in you is what notices the silence without.

2 - Listening and focusing all your attention on sounds that occur.  This one goes hand in hand with the first. Forget your breath for a moment, notice it, and then back to the silence. It is very similar to waiting, but not the anxious type of waiting that is considered a means to an end, but rather a conscious type of waiting, being totally present waiting for the next noise to occur.

3 - Flow with life.  When I can't get in the zone and my mind is running rampant, but rather open up completely to whatever your situation is at the present moment.  Let go of EVERYTHING, stay completely unattached. Here is a quote which was posted here once which resonated with me ""When we engage in the practice of discovering space, we should develop the feeling of opening ourselves out completely to the entire universe. We should open ourselves with absolute simplicity and nakedness of mind. This is the powerful and ordinary practice of dropping the mask of self-protection.""
This is taken from this awesome article

4 - Feeling the inner body. I'm sure this has been suggested plenty, arms, legs, belly, head) takes all your attention away from thinking.  Don't think about your body, go there directly with your attention and feel it from within. This gets you to the no-mind state also. There are plenty of youtube videos of Echkart describing this one. Just look up Eckhart Tolle inner body awareness or something like that if you're interested.

I am doing this because I am a seeker and I believe that mushroom hold answers for me. I am on day three and the results I am experiencing are absolutely mind blowing. I am keeping a blog here for those who want to follow me on my journey.

I am not recommending that others follow me on my journey. I have worked my way up to this and feel prepared to go to the depths and the heights that I will be going to. I hope that throughout this experience I might come out with greater understanding on how other can venture down this road while feeling safe. If that is their calling. 

What I am finding is that there are concepts outside of human understanding that can't be explained to us through words. When I go into the state that I am in after consuming magic mushrooms these concepts are able to be shown to me in ways beyond words. 

It is very hard to put in to words but it makes perfect sense in my head. I am going to do my best to explain the unexplained on my blog.

Ten Guides Along the Path (Powang Sammaeron)

1. Don’t hope for perfect health. Perfect health leads only to greater greed.
“Treat illness as medicine

2. Don’t long for a life free from hardship–such a life leads only to
haughtiness and self-pampering. “Make worries and hardships a way of life”
—so spoke the Enlightened One.

3. Don’t hope for a lack of impediments in your study. “Release is hiding right behind obstructions”—so spoke the Enlightened One.

4. Don’t hope for a lack of temptations in your training. A lack of temptations will only serve to soften your resolve. “Treat temptations as friends who are
helping you along the path”—so spoke the Enlightened One.

5. Don’t hope for easy success. Easy accomplishment leads only to increased
rashness. “Accomplish through difficulties”—so spoke the Enlightened One.

6. Don’t hope to get your own way with friends. Having friends give in to your wishes only leads to arrogance. “Make long-term friends through compromise in your relationships”—so spoke the Enlightened One.

7. Don’t expect people to follow your wishes or commands. This
arrogance. “Consider those who differ with you to be your character builders”
—so spoke the Enlightened One.

8. Don’t expect rewards for your kindnesses. This leads only to a scheming mind. “Throw out expectation of rewards like you’d thrown out old shoes”
—so spoke the Enlightened One.

9. Don’t expect more out of life than you deserve. Exaggerated profit-seeking leads only to foolishness. “Become rich at heart with small amounts”

10. Don’t complain about vexations. This leads only to resentment and poison in the heart. “Consider vexations as the first door on the path”—so spoke the Enlightened One.

I was experiencing some level of anxiety in my lucid dream before experiencing the meditation. It was an aggressive dream, and the dreamscape was resisting change, and my perceptions were limited and 'stuffy'. It was basically a lucid semi-nightmare. The anxiety built up over the course of the dream and in the end I was getting frustrated and anxious about my experience. When I closed my mind's eye the dreamscene disappeared, and I disappeared, but my awareness and lucidity was still functional because of the meditation. Now, normally if I closed my mind's eye in a dream I would soon lose consciousness and go back into a non-lucid dream, or I would simply not dream for a while

After some moments of meditation (time is hard to describe in dreams) I felt I could lock my concentration onto the state of my mind, more like being a blind person), and I could 'feel' my sleeping body all at the same time!

It was a fantastic experience

And when I opened my mind's eye back into the dream, no lusts nor hungers, and my suffering was gone for a brief period before I woke.

Never posted here but have been a subscriber for a long time. I thought you'd maybe want to hear something interesting I thought of after a short meditation session last night. 

This is usually how sessions go. I sit down and begin focusing on my breath

However, I watched myself watch what I was watching(right?). It turned out I had this movie of this perfect coherent breath going on in my head and was watching that. (Note: this wasn't an image per se, more of a conception of what was going on; I think we tend to do this a lot in day to day life unknowingly)

After taking my attention off of that I found *it*. I found the (what we call) breath! It was so much different than what I usually saw. It was varied in almost every way and it was perfectly imperfect. The best part about this was

A lot of you may be like ""so what?"". Well I'll tell you what. This has revealed to me a huge idea about how my(our?) mind works. The moment we drop all of our conceptions of the world is the moment we empty our minds. And

(Note: I used the word 'conception' here instead of 'preconception' because the latter insinuates we are thinking *before* the thing being thought of. From my experiences in meditation

I like to compare this sort of experience to something like this: it's been so hot for a few weeks that you (naturally) *expect* it to be hot when you step outside. But there was a cold front you didn't know about last night

or

You expect one more step upon going down the stairs but you've reached the bottom and are taken off guard.

or

You lean back too far in your chair.

In all of these experiences your mind is completely empty at least for a moment or two. My hypothesis is that the transition of these empty headed moments from fleeting/involuntary to constant/controlled is one of the ultimate goals of meditation. 

Thoughts?

**TL;DR**: Surprise me.

So

1.  Try speaking out loud your internal dialogue.  I have been using this one a lot after staying up all night studying for exams.  Speaking out whatever crazy thing you are thinking about will help you let it go and not keep dwelling on it for too long.


2. Get vigorous physical excessive.  This is one that people have always known about.  Long hikes


3.  Try consciously speaking one word of your internal dialogue with each in and out breath.  I use this one while trying to go to sleep.  Every in breath say one word in your mind


4. Try doing Ohm's.  Ohhhhmmmmmm is that thing you see monks doing on tv and movies.  Basically you take a slow breath in, AH while going up your chest, and M while going up your head.  Try doing it ten times in a row.


5. Look and listen to the world around you.


And finally, and not keep re-learning the same lessons, you must write them down.  That way you will be able to come back after a while and see how much progress you have made, and build upon what you have already learned.

I would start the day, and suddenly: ""Oh no, it´s so late ALREADY? I better get started doing something important."" At which point I would usually plop down on the couch and browse the web or whatever. A few hours later: ""Oh man, I wasted so much time today, and now it´s so late already, what a pathetic sadsack I am!""

So I was browsing a huge ""Complete Calvin &amp; Hobbes"" volume

And that was me. I was being terrorized by the clock.

...

Alan Watts explained that things like the clock are instruments

I´m very often in the mindset of ""okay, it fell out of my hands.

And as Eckhart Tolle put it so beautifully: ""What time is it? The time is NOW. It has always been NOW and it will always be NOW. Imagine a world with only plants and animals - the question ""What date is it today?"" is quite meaningless.""

...

One of the weirdest realisations I´ve had recently was when I was at a river with a huge bridge crossing it. I looked across on the other side. I walked over the bridge, and now I am here. I used to look at the other side, and now I´m standing here, looking at where I was standing just a moment ago."" As much as I usually think of time as something linear - the way I´ve been tought to think about it - at this moment it felt really circular, soft, and almost mushy to me, which felt really good.

Or when something dreadful is coming up: One moment you´re absolutely fearing it coming, was it? But in the past, the anxiety was very real. Now it´s gone, and it only faintly echoes in your mind.

...

I realized that time is my friend - not my enemy. Without the rhythm of things passing, and beautiful things would never be able to happen. Pain would last forever.

And really, time isn´t real, dude"", in a purely hypothetical concept - but I´m starting to realize that it ACTUALLY doesn´t exist. There is only now. When tomorrow arrives, it will be now. And yesterday is a memory, remembered now. Between the neverending torrent of seconds, hours, there only remains the vast open space of presence and awareness.

my own experience and journey",15,11,http://www.reddit.com/r/Meditation/comments/12nsag/to_those_who_dont_understand_meditation_here_is/,"I began meditating with a friend who was very familiar with the practice. He had used meditation to enter altered states of counciousness, explore other planes of existence, and explore himself.

He was a big believer in emptiness meditation

Now, while emptiness meditation involves stopping thought and then experiencing.

Most people can achieve some level of focus meditation, especially for those raised in Western cultures. Our minds chatter, and are filled with the ramblings of our existence. This is, I now understand, based on a ""lie"" that many people believe. That lie, is that you *are* your thoughts.

To those that have no experience at all with meditation

I tried. I really did. But stopping my thoughts... it was hard. I tried with music, I tried by myself. It was frustrating... trying so hard.

One night however, lit two candles, lit a stick of incense, and put on instrumental music... a genre called ""post-rock"". The song was [""We Happy Few"" by The Calm Blue Sea](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhhfk_1Pwhw).

I closed my eyes, just as I always had. Then I stopped trying. Each other time I had stopped trying I had gotten up to do something ""more productive"", but this time... this time I decided to stay there and not try.

At some point... at some point I ""succeeded"". It's difficult for me to describe the point at which it happened

And while I was experiencing, or feels, or plans, or judges, or fears. Just me. And yet, it was like I was everything. I could reach out and experience other things. Not really through will. You don't choose to, choosing requires thought. You just do.

It was one of the most incredible experiences I've ever had. And yet it was so natural. After... time... I experienced thought that wasn't mine. It was like experiencing the thought of someone else. I guess some people would describe it like ""hearing""

""What are you doing?"" it asked me. Was it my subconcious? Probably. It felt very different though. The experience was one that I could very easily characterize as having a conversation with God

""Nothing.""

""Do you want to do nothing?""

""...No...""

""Then do something.""

'We' of course were not talking about myself in that moment. We were talking about myself as a trajectory through life.

""Do what?"" I asked.

""That's the right question."" A pause. I knew that the conversation

I openned my eyes, yes. My eyes were the same. And yet, when I looked at something it was as if I could see it from all perspectives... I later described it... it was like... seeing in four dimensions... or something. Very difficult to describe.

I experienced the room. My eyes never left the smoke

If you are new to meditation, they have started their rambling answer with ""it's difficult to describe"". This is true. Description conveys information which instigates a thought. But this experience is achieved by clearing thought. Thought gets in the way of understanding what this type of experience is like, and so though I could spend one million words, I could never convey to you what it is truly like.

It would be like trying to fill a cup with juice by using hundreds of gallons of water. No matter what I say

Afterward

I travelled through my life knowing these things:

1. All things are a choice
2. All experiences are lessons.
3. Lessons are not about right and wrong
4. The only thing that stops your experience of anything is your choice to not experience it at that moment.
5. You are not your thoughts

Today,000 miles from where I was living. I didn't give it much thought, I just chose. I didn't worry too much about where I would live, my job, or so on, because those things will happen. That doesn't mean I didn't look for a job, or explore housing, because I knew what I ended up with would be right. Not because it was determined

Meditation is an experience. Nothing more. What it means to you is something no words can ever convey completely. You can only choose to experience it for yourself.",self,t5_2qnc9,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/Meditation/comments/12nsag/to_those_who_dont_understand_meditation_here_is/

I've gotten a lot out of the book but it has made me question the effect my meditation practice is having on my life.

**Meditation is elusive.** One minute I'm utterly convinced I have it figured out and possess the ability to deploy a mindful state at will. The next minute I'm sure I totally lost it and forgot ""how"" to do it,"" ""bad,"" or ""pain."") This reminds me that I'm not supposed to be feeling anything except exactly what I'm feeling right now. I'm not saying the elusiveness of meditation is good or bad, it's just what I've found to be the case.

**Progress in meditation is a paradox.** I feel that my six months of meditation has been life-changing, I still yearn and pine away for the same things, and I don't expect meditation to ever change this... what I expect meditation to do is help me accept this changelessness (or the mystery of how to change, or if we even should change) and be aware of it. And what acceptance and awareness does, I think, is throw you a lifesaver during storms of overwhelming emotion. In other words, your extreme feelings of anxiety and depression become dampened and muted, I said to myself

**My biggest epiphany so far.** With the emphasis on slowing down and observation and 'seeing things how they actually are, my biggest epiphany has been about the huge amount of denial in life and the enormous association between denial and pain. So much of my emotional stress was caused by this denial... denial that what I used to have I no longer have... denial that a person that used to like me now doesn't... denial that I used to have status because of something, and I no longer do... denial that someone I used to love, I no longer love… denial that I have impulses that can be cruel and selfish and narcissistic and other forms of things we're not supposed to be… denial that my life didn't turn out the way I wanted and planned for. Our minds set up these huge barriers of denial and cling to either the past or cling to ideas we hold now that aren't true... because we just can't possibly imagine life being different than our ideal version of it. This is what I mean by denial. And I'll end on this note: I think the biggest and most pain-causing form of denial is the denial that life itself just isn't as pleasurable or beautiful or good as we thought it would be when we were kids, and we are all still in gigantic denial of this. To me, meditation teaches you to accept crushingly boring, tedious, so we can have more pockets of joy when they do come.

I want to clear my mind of all of the toxic I’ve manifested over the last 24 years. 

I am constantly agitated

I get angry about the most trivial things and it sometimes I feel like it complete dominates my life. In addition to this
I think part of my anger is when people do things that violate my own personal code which is asinine because how are they supposed to know what the fuck I think is appropriate? I also can’t tolerate people who I feel like are less intelligent than me

Here’s what confuses me about myself: I’ve watched documentaries that have made me almost feel empathetic

Another example is I have misogynist thoughts and attitudes at times. Sometimes I feel like I have hatred for women because I find the stereotypical hobbies and interests to be beyond useless. It gets me mad to even think about teenage girl’s spending money on bullshit. Then I realize that not all girls/females/women are the same, unless they’re not? Does this make sense? Then I have the audacity to label myself a pro-feminist male, and chastise others for doing the same shit that I do in my head.

I have the same faults that I abhor in other people.  How can this be? Is it because I spent so much of my childhood lying that I just started lying to myself? I can actually force myself to believe a lie. I don’t want to self-impose a pathological liar diagnosis on myself, but not all the time. On several occasions I’ve ruined her day/night/plans with my selfishness and sour attitude.  On reflection I’ve always been able to identify the things I did/said wrong but I keep making the same mistakes over and over.

It would be nice if the meditation subreddit could exist for those of us that want to discuss our interest (meditation) without having to sift through a weekly crop of posts on ""I meditated on ____

I'll admit that I'm a little biased. I don't like drug culture

But this is a meditation reddit. Not a drug use reddit. ~~So it bothers me to see it posted and tolerated here: both for personal reasons

~~Even putting that aside for a moment... these vast majority of such posts just... aren't about meditation. They're about the drugs. You don't need to meditate on mind-altering substances to have an altered experience. Posting ""Hey I meditated on drugs

And I think we're just all a little tired of this same discussion happening in every single post. To me

Or maybe people like me are the minority. In which case

**EDIT: I'M PROBABLY WRONG. I have no answers to valid points some people raised.**

A few people have raised the interesting point that this opens the door to needing to police every controversial topic, not specific traditions. I must admit that there may be traditions in which drug use is a welcomed part of the exploration. My wording along those lines may have also been quite poor, and not fully separated the point I was trying to make and my own biases. So I apologize for that.

1359369198.0,17f8hg,"Did I briefly experience ""nirvana""?",fdtm,103,28,46,"**TL;DR** - *It seems through mindfulness meditation I achieved a state of hyper-awareness

I've been practicing my own type of ""meditation"" sporadically (every week or so) for the past few months, etc.) since a child (I don't know why), but I never really motivated myself to really try it seriously until recently.

So recently I've achieved a few very interesting effects over these past few months. These are all quite ""real"" in the sense that they're perceptual shifts

Note two things: (1) I am not religious

* I am able to remember almost perfectly now

* For brief moments, with imagination and intuition greatly enhanced.

* This hyper aware state continues to even greater degrees

The last bullet point mentioned is the strangest of all, here for a while, then it slips away. However it's as though the waves are coming more frequently and more powerfully recently. The most recent event (as of about a month ago) is this:

I was sitting outside just meditating with eyes open. I suddenly realized a strange mental shift. I had attained this state by meditating on the concept ""watch"" (""watch my thoughts. watch my senses. do not analyze. just watch."") Like the second bullet point above, as away from the concept of body ever being distinct at all). I realized I was hungry, so I started walking to a food place nearby (this is in the city).

As I was walking down the sidewalk, smells powerfully unique and amazing, all sensations seemed wonderful and yet, I felt no need to grin or anything. I just experienced, perceived, with any identifiable ""flow"" of thoughts no longer existing as such. I just ""was"". My thoughts were one. There was no distinct flow or order or sequence or routine or method. Just thought. It's a sensation that of pure genuine awareness and coexistent co-experiencing and one-ness with reality that is the most full form of ""well being"" I can describe.

In a way, my mind was aware that the driver was most likely staring intently at the road, but not fully present. The drivers are lost in their heads, thinking ""I have to get to the store, buy milk, then drive home. Then I'll ..."". It was as though the people all around me were living a life in programmed slots, enslaved to their routine. Every day we go about our jobs and ignore all the amazing sights, etc. around us because we're too busy trapped in our minds and our constructed realities, for a single object.

While waiting for dinner to arrive, but now my ""ego"" or sense of ""me"" was beginning to dissolve. This became slightly scary, but I tried to just continue the theme of ""just watch, don't analyze/try"". 

I could perceive the individual motions of each hair on my hand and head/neck. I realized that every time I breathe, heartbeat, all at once. I was sitting at the table, staring blankly out, motionless. At this moment, I could ""feel"" (empathy) more tangibly the behavior and emotional state of people around me more than I ever have in my life. And yet my emotions were no longer really human in the sense that the animal emotions dissolve away along with the ego. Only the more powerful/profound emotions/feelings remained; love, amazement, empathy

Then, but it was very interesting (if not slightly terrifying). The state still lingered, and while I ate at this place many times before, that still was the best tasting meal I had in my life. To provide basis for comparison: the pleasure enhancing effect this meditation had on senses (like taste) was *vastly* beyond Marijuana for example (though I've only tried it once before so this comparison is based on memory), but also quite different obviously as this state was one of hyper awareness.

I can't really describe it very well though. This is only an attempt to explain a wordless experience with words. I am not very well educated on meditation etc.

All I know is this state was certainly pleasant through most of it. I'm sure with practice I can achieve it again - but it does seem these things come in ""waves"" I suppose as my mind learns how to maintain a certain state better over time.",self,t5_2qnc9,1359370565.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/Meditation/comments/17f8hg/did_i_briefly_experience_nirvana/

I´ve been meditating (almost) daily since maybe a month, if not more important to my personal mental state, so I thought I´d share my experiences in that field with you and to hear if some of you have some little techniques of your own. My way of looking at meditation and awareness has been shaped a lot by ""Whereever You Go, There You Are"" by Jon Kabat-Zinn, with his very simple lay way of talking about these concepts.

So here it goes:

---

**Cutting out selfmade noise**

I´ve always been very used to always have something blasting in my ear, then the Sansa Clip). I was listening to EVERYTHING - music, podcasts (didn´t really matter what kind, I somehow got stuck on tech podcasts, mostly because the topics were kinda repetetive but I got so used to the hosts voices), audiobooks, whatever.

I simply felt that if I didn´t have something blabbering in my ears I would somehow faint and fall over from instant boredom. Ever since I started to live my daily live with more awareness I noticed that not only I don´t become bored that easily - there really is always something going on

I ride the subway quite a lot during the week, focus on my body and my breath, and suddenly taking the train becomes a breeze.

Oh

---

**What´s that thing?**

Especially early in the morning my thoughts tend to race in all directions. I´ve bought an iPod Touch earlier this year and it has become a bad habit to check my emails

So when I´m in the kitchen fixing my breakfast and being generally a bit grumpy I try to pay attention to stuff I´ve never noticed before. For instance how the light falling through the windows on any particular morning looks. Or how the brown bubbles on the black grain coffee* form very funny shapes - sometimes I spend a few moments blowing them around in my mug. Or how my feet feel on the floor.

When I leave the house I try to really look at little details - the funny pattern on the floor tiles which I just recently really noticed for the very first time. The odd pipes that run along the ceiling. All this are things I have completely missed all these years I´ve been living here!

(*Grain coffee because real coffee makes me either fly off the handle or jittery and anxious


---

**Speeding up by slowing down**

Ever noticed that the faster you do things the more likely you are to not do them right? I run from the bathroom into the kitchen and already forgot what I was meaning to do. Or I still have wet hair but already am checking my email and getting the keyboard wet, and then I get cold because I´ve been running around shirtless for half an hour, and still haven´t brushed my teeth.

So now I´m trying to actually do things in order: Take a shower, everything in a nice controlled flow without running to my computer with my toothbrush in my mouth. This means I get ready to go outside *a lot* faster than I used to. I even sometimes catch myself thinking ""oh shit, it´s so late already, I need to... oh wait, I already did that"".

My head isn´t going to explode if I take a few moments more to fix my breakfast

I grew up not really knowing much about meditation, buddhist, or both. It always seemed like something I'd never really bother with. Then I heard a friend mention that Steve Jobs had found meditation to be a far more heady, trippy experience than any drug he had ever tried.
 
Curious, I've begun experiencing powerful visual hallcunations around the 15-20 minute mark.
I never even thought this was possible. Do other people who meditate experience these effects?
 
A little more about the technique I'm using
I usually listen to the album ""76:14"" by Global Communication, and 4, and by track 4, I begin experiencing hardcore visuals (track 4, 9:39 is especially trippy). I make sure my room is clean and quiet, and lay down on my back. I find my back works best, as it is comfortable
 
Next, and feel as though the music is doing the thinking for me. This was particularly difficult when I first began, but somehow, it has gotten much easier to focus on absolutely nothing. If the occasional thought does crop up, I gently let it pass by, without paying it any attention.
 
Eventually, the old cliche of being ""one with everything""). It's at this point when intense euphoria and relaxation sets in, and I begin to experience the visuals. Mostly grand, sweeping colors and cosmic imagery. Time completely stops, and I rest for what feels like an eternity. As track 4 ends, I am reminded that my time is up, and I slowly drift back to reality.
 
What I've noticed is that I now feel much happier every day. I tend to notice natural beauty (trees, clouds) more often, and they feel infinitely more valuable (ugh, probably turning into a hippie). And the sleep I receive after meditating is some of the best, most restful sleep I've ever experienced.

----------------------------------

The purpose of meditation is to form a very valuable habit.  The habit of: 

1) Being aware of your thoughts as they happen
2) Understanding why you had that particular thought and 
3) Then being able to refocus on what deserves your attention in the present moment.  

In this way we are able to recognize our thoughts and deal with them before they turn into trails of though which pull us into the past or future and away from the present moment.

To put it another way

Begin by focusing on your breath.  As the inevitable thoughts come into mind

Essentially you are practicing the habit of though recognition (acknowledging the thought)

By doing this you are practicing the habit of being in the moment.  

Also by taking a moment to understand why you had the thought you are teaching yourself that you are not your thoughts--They may arise for a logical reason

For example

During meditation I recognize this thought

Habit rules our lives.  Through the practical methods of thought awareness

----

I've been meditating about twice daily (15-30 minutes) for about two years, but I've rarely found that type of thing very interesting to read about myself, so...

Here's a thought. There's a bias in the current ""secular"" discourse about meditation

Just to shake things up a bit, ""I read twice a day and I have found that it gives me a noticable increase in feelings of joy and wellbeing."" You would say, ""okay, but what are you reading? Is it interesting? What have you learned?"" Of course meditation and reading are not the same thing, but I just want to point out that it's not immediately obvious that everything people do intentionally is for ""emotional benefits.""

For me, but if I had to say something, I'd say it has a lot to do with the relationship between myself and ""phenomena."" Maybe between my mind as such and its specific manifestations -- I'm aware this might sound pretty crazy. It has to do with figuring out (or penetrating or unravelling or getting to the bottom of) some kind of fundamental confusion.

I am new to meditation, issues focusing, etc. My practice has been rocky but I am committed to continue.

Last night I was laying in bed trying to fall asleep and my mind was racing so I decided to start focusing on my breathing. Something amazing ""clicked"" after a few minutes; whether it was because my mindset was different because I hadn't sat down with the goal of meditating, my body felt so unbelievably small and mind felt so unbelievably large. I felt like I was looking at myself floating through space. I was able to focus intently on a single thought, or think about nothing at all as I ""watched"" myself. I don't know how else to explain it. I wouldn't say it's the first time something like this has happened, but it's the first time I really acknowledged it and delved ""deeper"".

Anyway, yoga, and general mental well-being: perhaps it is wrong to go into any sort of practice looking to ""fix"" something, because you'll always be in the mind set of expecting some sort of result. You do it because it's healthy and in the long run it will be beneficial for your mind. I believe this concept manifested itself last night. Every time so far I've sat down to meditate, I've been in the mind frame of ""Ok odoyle489, don't attach to thoughts, don't linger, let thoughts flow through you, and I reached a level of mental clarity that I'd never reached before with focused effort.

So, I don't know, but perhaps the one thing I'm going to take away from this experience is to not be too hard on myself. I need to stop ""trying"" to be mindful, and just ""be"" mindful.

How would the Dalai Lama or any of you show compassion or love to someone like this? Is it possible? Is it even worth attempting? Is their any benefit to trying to send love or compassion to someone like this after destroying the life of an infant in the  most horrific way possible? Is there anything at the core of this person that is pure or worth saving or are there people out there who are the epitome of evil? Evil incarnate?

Would any of you who practice loving kindness extend love to this person? How?

Turiya suggested we continue the discussion based on [this bit](http://www.reddit.com/r/Meditation/comments/hyj17/new_to_meditationsome_basic_questions/c1zubra).

In mindfulness meditation, or a distinct process (since you're not following the thoughts, but just letting them dissipate - or aim to anyway).

Other forms explicitly incorporate structured contemplation on something (e.g. Zen riddles; or many religious practices involving contemplation on religious ideals) whether as a tool or as a goal in itself.

Some aim at clearing the mind of all thought and maintaining strict concentration.

It'd be interesting to see what people here think about how thoughts and thinking fit into your various practices.

Being an anxious person, great ""insights"" that will keep me coming back for more, etc. and etc. Maybe I was foolish to believe that, but hey, that's how meditation is pushed over in the Western world.

So what happened?

I'm not really sure. Been meditating for six months now. When I started, more focus, even some ""insights"" that helped me to work on inner blocks that I wasn't letting go of. It was great! Upon finding this subreddit, I felt like I made some great leaps and bounds in my practice. I learned to expect nothing; to be nothing, all that jazz. Good times.

But recently, that's terrifying. I increased my practice time to 15 minutes in the morning and 10 minutes at night; I felt better for about a week.

I know meditation is all about sitting with these emotions and thoughts

The only ""insights"" that I've gotten in the past month have been negative: I'm a shitty guitarist, ridiculously weak student, shitty son, and pathetic person in general.

Everybody says ""Get a teacher!"" Unfortunately

So yeah, regardless of whether or not it's actually making me feel like shit, or I'm becoming more aware of the fact that I've always felt like shit, has got to either stop I need to get some serious help.

The feeling was as though the base energy I experienced should be expressed in its most true and most powerful form to accomplish the most good.

I also wanted to focus on what I considered to be the worst part of myself, but because of my state of mind, I was able to fully appreciate the full implications and meaning of that lost time. I’ve begun to implement reminders for myself to improve and realize my full potential. It was a little unsettling to focus my thoughts so clearly and roll them around in isolation. Seeing things for how they truly are is extremely beneficial though.

As a few of you might remember, one session a day, sometimes adding a 5 or 10 minute session in the morning or in the evening if I am in the mood to do so. I have been quite wary of burning out if I try too hard and I keep my workload low but my dedication steady.
The following are the somewhat scattered intuitions and doubts I have collected over the past month. I hope they might be useful to other total beginners and I encourage more experienced meditators and newbies alike to comment on them.

* The hardest and most confusing task for me (and probably most beginners)
Without understanding what that very interior state feels like, I ""felt"" for the first time I was watching my breath, rather than mentally saying to myself: ""Ok I am breathing, now let's see what happens"". 

* I also found that there is a difference between acknowledging that a breath has just been exhaled, microsecond by microsecond, synchronising the feeling and the observation, never letting the latter lag on or anticipate the former. This is a very recent realisation and not at all a mindfulness skill which I master (yet), but it gave me a glimpse on what the author of Mindfulness in Plain English meant when he discussed accepting and cherishing the impermanence of experience. I try to treat every single breath as a unique snowflake, which I can only experience for a brief moment before it melts, and which I will never see again, as transient as the previous one.

* A second problemis not just removing the distractions that enter the head while meditating, now I am meditating"", which instinctively do not appear as distractions at all.
Additionally

* Somebody some time ago in this subreddit defined meditation as a weight workout, a little improvement takes place which is carried on to the next distraction, the next minute of meditation, the next session. The mind becomes focused on the breath as a consequence of the workout, it is not the workout. I agree with that statement and it should be made prominent in instructions given to beginners.

* Coincidentally

* Meditation so far seems to be the art of stopping the conscious mind at the ""logic gates"" of experience, I know) to wait for a few seconds and focus on the sensation of craving 'non-judgementally', observing it for what it is, without telling myself I should or shouldn't smoke it. When I am done, I decide whether I want to light it or not. Most times I still do, a few times I don't. Since I am on the topic of smoking, so far the most beautiful experience I had after meditating was lighting a cigarette a couple of minutes after a session. I was experiencing a quite interesting sensation of relaxation and as I sat there with the cigarette in hand, crisscrossing the cigarette's smoke beautifully dancing and twirling in the air. Of the thousands of cigarettes I smoked in my life

* I meditate cross-legged on a makeshift large pillow, reaching a perhaps acceptable but sub-par position. Whenever I become aware of this, it requires me to interrupt my mindfulness (assuming I had any to start with), reposition myself and start concentrating again. Am I doing this right? Should I just ignore it once I'm in position?

* Considered that of course not everyone is the same and that it takes time to develop any significant result

* Finally, most condensed and most objective insight I have read are on this subreddit. Wouldn't it be a neat idea to start a collaborative wiki/introduction to meditation to publish on the sidebar, or to significantly expand the current FAQ?",,False,self,t5_2qnc9,,http://www.reddit.com/r/Meditation/comments/nwzuw/i_have_been_meditating_for_exactly_30_days_now/
1323708126.0,n9s1x,Just got back from my first 10-day Goenka retreat. When do I stop tripping balls?,classical_hero,60,6,52,"As the title says

Anyway this was my first real experience with any type of meditation

The first and most weird is that I have an old back injury. It's not exactly clear what it is, and apparently this sort of injury is common amongst rowers, so they assumed this is what was happening even though the MRI didn't show anything. 

The symptoms I was having at the time, and if not it would eventually get so that I couldn't stand anymore. So I had to take ibuprofen twice a week or so for a while. It's been fine for at least a year though unless I drink a lot, which I rarely do.

Anyway so what happened is that after day 5 my legs started walking themselves. I still had to decide where to go and look where I was going, and last for about three seconds. Every time this would happen my back and posture would straighten up and again my legs would start walking on their own, at a faster cadence than I normally walk and with a slightly different walking style. The feeling of the electricity itself was not unpleasant at all, it was almost like a very subtle electrostim that you would get as part of rehab for an injury, almost pleasant in nature. This has mostly gone away, but I'm still trying to figure out what the hell was going on here as it was extremely weird.

The second thing that was happening, and it felt like a ring of consciousness was going up and down my body for lack of a better word. Every time this ring passed over a passed of my body it would slightly stiffen up. This is still happening. It's not extremely aggravating, but it definitely makes me a little sea sick as everything is still wobbling a bit. I just got back from the retreat yesterday morning so it may still go away, but I'm wondering if anyone else knows what I'm talking about or has any idea if there is anything that can be done about this. It doesn't especially bother me and I wouldn't freak out if it was here indefinitely, but all things being equal I would probably prefer it to be gone. Because of this I haven't been meditating today, even though otherwise I would have wanted to keep with doing the hour and the morning and evening as Goenka recommends. 

Other than the physical weirdness, albeit I do think there are some improvements that could and probably should be made. E.g. I think students should be able to access real medical experts during the course because it is so demanding and because so many things go up, simply saying Anicca isn't good enough for people who need health or mental health advice.  Anyway also feel free to ask me any questions related to my experience",,False,self,t5_2qnc9,,http://www.reddit.com/r/Meditation/comments/n9s1x/just_got_back_from_my_first_10day_goenka_retreat/

A five minute meditation anyone can do,65,11,20,http://www.reddit.com/r/Meditation/comments/g78a0/anxiety_and_panic_are_illusions_be_free_a_five/,"Most of our meditation times are somewhat planned out and eased into.

But anxiety or panic can strike


Here's a quick ""self-defense meditation"" that absolutely saved me from panic.


The first thing to realize is that fear is an evolutionary instinct to keep us from jumping off of cliffs or running into traffic


The main thing that sets us into panic is our breathing becomes very shallow and quickened as a result of our heart-rate going up and our bodies creating adrenaline


* Sit down.

* Hold your hands palm up in your lap.

* Touch your index fingers to your thumbs.

* Breathe in as deep as you can and hold it. Count to 5. Let it out.

* Breathe as deeply as possible and as slow as possible for five long breaths.

* Repeat this for all 4 fingers.



* Realize that everything is alright and focus on a love-filled memory.


Holding your breath as well as breathing slowly helps to slow your heart-rate
and stops the production of adrenaline in your body.


Once you calm down and supply your brain with enough oxygen



My biggest problem was that I would sit in the ""neutral"" zone all day.
Not being fearful


* Pure and fearless happiness is standing next to you every moment of the day.




* All you need to do is turn away from negativity

Many people ask me if they are meditating correctly, to reach awareness of the truth within ourselves. Most all variations of meditation fall under these aims.

For those confused about ""how' to meditate

Let me offer a few metaphors to help you understand why meditation is such a powerful practice and how it's done correctly.

Imagine yourself meditating, those waves representing all the busy thoughts in your mind swirling around in your body like dirt floating in a glass of muddy water. These thoughts are not you, they all arise from the society you are part of, from the life you've led up until now. They all have affinities and reasons for arising. They are completely selfless and transient. In meditation you watch these thoughts, you watch them flow by like a passing train without following them, because with awareness you become separate from your thoughts. They soon lose their energy and start to subside. The mud begins to settle at the bottom of the glass. The spaces between the train carts become wider and wider. The waves of energy stop defining the space of the human being and the boundaries made by the thought energy starts dissolving. The water becomes clear, the railroad empty and you begin to see yourself for who you really are. You become present in the world outside of your mind. You begin to see yourself as something separate from the ego

By sitting in meditation and observing your breath you are sharpening your mind to focus on the truth of the present moment. You do not try and breathe you just watch your body breathing, whatever the truth really is, and by watching and not reacting, you gain space between your true self and the story your living. In that space you find complete freedom, glorious bliss.

In your life you slowly start seeing the difference between story and truth. You start walking around with this space you've created for yourself. You stop reacting habitually to things and start acting with intent and compassion. 

Only you can discover the truth for yourself.

I had decided to go onto a 10 day meditation course that taught vipassana meditation. It was a program where we had to meditate 10 hours a day for 10 days. 
For the first three days we did anapana meditation, and entered Jahana once while doing anapana meditation on the course.

Difficulties started to arise when I attempted vipassna meditation. On the second session of attempting it, I felt like I had a fever. 
However on the next attempt
On the night of the fifth day (one whole day of vipassana meditation), but nothing too major.. I had a bit of difficultly falling asleep as I felt a bit strange.. 
When I woke up in the morning I felt normal again

The major problems arose on the night of the 6th day.

After a heavy session of vipassana meditation, but the vibrations were stronger and I got dizzy whenever I shifted my eyes, I found it difficult to focus on things.
After an hour or so after these symtoms
I had an experience of derealisation

I had a feeling of paranoia arising. This is when I tried to go to my sleeping quarters and sleep it off.
While lying in bed I started hallucinating fractal patterns and psychedelic images (with eyes open). I had a ""shock"" of orgasmic electricity starting from my foot
I spent the next 3-4 hours trying to ground myself by reading instructions on the back of an alarm clock

During this whole ordeal, but I was not ready, so I resisted with all my might. I wasn't ready to give up my cozy concept of reality.

I spoke to the meditation teacher the next day. He was surprised with what happened with me

Over the following days, talking to people, going out, etc.

I am now sitting here mostly grounded (very subtle vibration occurring in my head) trying to make sense of the situation.

I've noticed a few changes in myself, I am more happy, but it is nothing too major, mostly subtle, but definitely noticeable. My ability to go into deep concentration had greatly increased (I tried this once, but got some of the original symptoms and decided to stop). 

I've done some research on my experience and came across [kundalini syndrome](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kundalini_syndrome) (I knew about this before


I am going to be giving up meditation for a long while until I know it's safe. It may be that I am prone to schizophrenia and meditation is a catalyst for it. 

but now the questions remain:
Why did this happen to me
What does this experience signify? 
Are there any recommended specialists that deal with this?
Will I ever be able to meditate again?

My mom was going through a bad divorce and met a lady at her work who invited us to a very charismatic/evangelical church. Praying in tongues and ""prophecy"" was a very normal part of my childhood/young adulthood (and the same goes for many of my friends, I realized that I clung to all of that because I had no family really. My mom was what I had as a young person and I had seen her strength and trusted her, so I jumped in. I ""spoke in tongues"" for hours, prayed for hours, fasted, danced, shouted

Fast forward to highschool, like the bible says) wrecked my life to no end. I would have conversations with this person's sister (she was older and wiser) about how I felt and the pain I was in. She had a simple suggestion, meditation. Though she didn't call it that, the practice for relaxing that she described was just that. I promise I'm going somewhere with this....

Fast forward to me being 18...I go off to this place called Teen Mania, breakfast around 6 (you need to hurry through it) then shower and quiet time til around 7:30 or 8. Then work til noon (I was a grounds keeper) eat lunch, maybe have a class til 2 (depending on the time of year) work til 5 or 6, more class then dinner or vice versa, then different activities with your ""group"" or CORE...my days ended between 10 and midnight. This was how my year went, for exactly one year. 

Throughout that year are different retreats to ""bring you closer to God""

In the couple of years that followed after leaving, I drank a lot (I'm in my early 20's, it happens), I've tried enough drugs, I've left the church altogether, I've gone to therapy, I've had symptoms of PTSD, and all in all I still have this spiritual longing...it doesn't go away. I've meditated very little

I'm just very scared. I've been hurt, but often times that's how I get my fix so to speak. That's what feels natural now in place of where I used to pray or read my bible, or just sit in silence. 

I want to know what's ""safe""...I'm interested in zen buddhism as well

I have been going through a rough patch this year and became interested in meditation some months ago

Today has been one of the craziest days of my life. Began antidepressants this week, but managed to control the external symptoms enough for no-one to notice, went about my job (hotel doorman) with a cheerful demenor as a Battle Royale between my ego/anxiety (visualised as a dark whispy black gas) and my Being/present moment awareness (a strong radiant white light) took place within my body. I was able to dis-identify from the negativity, visualise it as seperate from myself and for two hours I alternated between wrestling with it and laughing it off. I haven't felt this proud in myself in a long time. Sorry if this wording sounds more like an exorcism than a meditation.

Anyway, and had the most beautiful meditative experience of my life to date. I sat for longer than I ever have (probably around 30 minutes) and funnily enough had none of the usual boredom or distractibility and I was completely engrossed in exploring my breath and my inner state, I have a feeling the sleep deprivation helped.

At one point I turned my awareness to my spinal cord and visualised cleansing bursts of radiant joyful white light pulsating my spine with each in/exhale. Soon enough

I feel that this has been a real breakthrough for my meditation and life in general. I couldnt help but be reminded of Bill Hick's ""[It's Just a Ride](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMUiwTubYu0)"" speech

So, and helping me on my way to a better life. Best of luck to you all.

I remember waking up, he was poking me with needles and took a tube out of my mouth, I coughed and took a deep breath, I felt my body grow warm, I felt tingly, I hurt still but I felt strength and felt my blood flowing and the pounding sound of my heart beat was deafening but I could hear and see again! I reached out for my mom. We arrived at the hospital. The nurses and doctors watched over me, machines told everyone I was ok. I was so scared. My mom told me I was ok

I thought this was a dream I had when I was a child, I ran far from the dream, I wanted to forget the dream, I didn't want to be reminded that this body will die. I was talking to my mom about it, because I've been going through some tough times and my life feels lost and without purpose it's why I started meditating. Depression, anxiety, feeling cold hearted, social interaction

My mom looked at me and with the most serious look and tone I've ever seen, I called 911, the paramedic was able to bring you back, you stopped breathing, your heart just stopped. There was no damage to your heart, you weren't choking, there was no medical reason why. You stopped living and for a brief moment you died
 
I either had a breakthrough or a breakdown at that moment

Meditation is very powerful tool. That moment of realization made everything seem so small and insignificant, being to afraid to talk to that guy, to afraid to say I love you, afraid of this aging and pained body, all my fears just, died. And damn life is amazing! I no longer fear death, yes I'm still imperfect and will suffer but now it doesn't matter because in a moment, so through the good and the bad

Yesterday I was browsing the interwebs in a few meditation forums

I would usually make small notes of thoughts and sensations when mindful, which I felt much more varied and interesting as a point of concentration than the border of the nostrils. As I felt deeper and deeper into meditation and felt the breathing much more subtle, I was observing multiple sensations and thoughts a second, at an ever increasing rate.

Eventually, glowing light in my upper field of vision, like candlelight or a flashlight on a pendulum. I was startled and astounded, but attempted to observe the phenomenon in a detached manner as much as possible (just to confirm, I did open my eyes for a minute and, sure thing, the perception of light was not from an external source).

After continuing in this state for a few more minutes and contemplating the whole situation, the individual ligaments and muscles, and was able to pinpoint the saccading motion of the eyes and the separate pictures that composed an image and the mental formation created out of that image.

I felt extremely excited and strange

This morning I woke up to do errands

As I waited in line, I pulled out a tablet and played a little action game. I was able to immediately fall into the flow of the game. I could see my actions with complete clarity and no emotion, eventually finishing with a score ten times higher than what I get casually and none of the nervousness or excitement that inhibit it.

As a final close of the day, and was suddenly struck with the insight to understand the following koan:

&gt;Two monks were arguing about a flag. One said: ""The flag is moving.""
The other said: ""The wind is moving.""
The sixth patriarch happened to be passing by. He told them: ""Not the wind

It sounds ridiculous

-----


The First Reason We Meditate – To Get In Touch With Reality

The art of meditation is a way of getting in touch with reality. The reason for it is that most civilized people are out of touch with reality, there is the real world and on the other a whole system of symbols about that world which we have in our minds. These are very useful symbols all civilization depends on them, but like all good things they have their disadvantages and the principle disadvantage is that we can confuse them with reality. Just as we confuse money with actual wealth. And our names about ourselves, our ideas of ourselves, our images of ourselves, *with* ourselves. Now of course reality from a philosophers point of view is a dangerous word. A philosopher will ask me, “What do I mean by reality? Am I talking about the physical world of nature? Or am I talking about a spiritual world? Or what?” And to that I have a very simple answer - when we *talk* about the material world, that’s also a philosophical concept

Reality is …(he bangs on a gong and we hear the noise resonate)… and we won’t give it a name.

Now it’s amazing what doesn’t exist in the real world. For example, in which we describe things and events in the same way as we would project images on a Rorschach blot or pick out particular groups of stars in the sky and call them constellations as if they were separate groups of stars. Well, they’re groups of stars in the minds’ eye, in our systems of concepts, they are not out there as constellations already grouped in the sky. 

So in the same way the difference between myself and all the rest of the universe is nothing more than an idea

Because, I don’t hear what anyone else has to say, and so in exactly the same way if I think all the time - that is to say if I talk to myself all the time - I don’t have anything to think about except thoughts. And therefore I’m living entirely in the world of symbols and I’m never in relationship with reality.

The Second Reason We Meditate – Meditation Doesn’t Have A Reason

This is going to be a little bit more difficult to understand. We could say that meditation doesn’t have a reason, except perhaps making music and dancing. Because, when we make music, we don’t do it in order to reach a certain point, such as the end of a composition. If that were the purpose of music, to get to the end of the piece, then obviously the fastest players would be the best. And so likewise, we are not aiming to arrive at a particular place on the floor

Meditation is the discovery that the point of life is always arrived at in the immediate moment. And, to improve your mind, to improve your character, to be more efficient in life – you’ve got your eye on the future and you are not meditating. Because, the future is a concept; it doesn’t exist. As the proverb says, “Tomorrow never comes.” There is no such thing as tomorrow; there never will be, because time is always now. That’s one of the things we discover when we stop talking to ourselves and stop thinking; there is only a present – only an eternal now. 

It’s funny then, ‘for the enjoyment of it,’ and here I would interpose the essential principal that meditation is supposed to be fun. It’s not something you do as a grim duty. The trouble with religion as  we know it, is that it is so mixed up with grim duties, ‘we do it because it’s good for you, it’s a form of self-punishment’. Well, meditation when correctly done has nothing to do with all that. It’s a kind of digging in the present; it’s a kind of grooving with the eternal now. And it brings us into a state of peace where we can understand that the point of life, is simply here and now.

======================

I'm currently reading ""The Power of Now"" by Eckart Tolle and one strategy that is briefly mentioned in the book as a way to maintain awareness in the present moment is to bring your focus on the empty space in the room.

I've been doing this for a while and it is very interesting. I guess that in ""normal"" or ""default"" conciousness

I've found that what happens when doing this is that I step-out of my ego. Instead of seeing the world from the point of view of the watcher inside my head

I beleive this sensation might be a very low level of ego-loss. It's almost like removing myself from ordinary conciousness and tapping into some super-conciousness and then seeing myself from that perspective. This is only intensified when I've done this and smoked cannabis.

Has anyone else ever tried this method of raising awareness or experienced something similar?

I had been hesitant. Meditation was never a tool I used while *too* immersed in any negative feelings. I consider myself new to meditation (been doing it for years but I am inconsistent). 

I was able to visualize my anxiety/depression as something separate from myself. A force that acted on me but wasn't a part of me.  I'd always owned my anxiety and considered it a unavoidable part of who I am. By considering it something outside of me it suddenly seemed less all-encompassing.This breakthrough was so f-ing fantastic.

Why did I start meditation ? It’s dumb ! I’m a person who has very frequent nosebleed, to calm down the inner-me. And that’s how I came to meditation.

 

I must say that the hardest part, it’s a moment I truly enjoy.

 

I know I didn’t meditate for much long but I can already feel the changes inside me. I feel much more at peace with myself, I could picture myself as a quiet ocean.

 

The other benefit is, deeper. I succeed in getting rid of all these thoughts that keep you awake. I don’t know if it’s linked but I remember my dreams much more now.

We do cardio so this bad stuff won't happen. We give our heart some regular attention

When we do cardio we discover something too. We discover that we have more energy and are happier. We find that we can do things that we couldn't do before. We can play all day. Yes

Meditation is like cardio. We do meditation so we have a healthy awareness.

Like the heart, confusion, lack of discipline. We might not even notice anything is wrong (being so used to this low state) until we blow up at somebody, or do something dumb.

So we meditate. We sit and do our thing every day. We maintain our awareness health.

Meditation is also like cardio in that if we do it, smarter, more disciplined, more creative. We discover powers and freedoms that we never even thought of. New perspectives open.

I am new to meditation. I went to a 10 week Vipassana course on May 1st and this was my first real dive into meditation. It was much more than I expected. I thought it was going to be a technique I could use to escape life's troubles. Instead I was facing my own ""demons"" right up front.

It was really good for me, how deeply stuck I am in my own ruts of depression-related thoughts. One negative thing starts a cascade of self-judgement and that leads into just feeling flat-out depressed for weeks on end.

Depression is something I've dealt with all my adult life (23 now

Vipassana meditation hasn't really made my depression better per se, and I'm grateful for this piece of self-knowledge.

My experiences with Vipassana has also taught me about the transient nature of my own emotional states. I can feel depressed and then I can feel not-depressed

This knowledge still hasn't kept me from being depressed or trying to seek out a way out of my depression. I'm fine being sad just by myself. The problem is interacting with other people. I don't want to spread my misery around. I feel pressure to be sociable and smiling and I feel like I'm being a bad son/brother/friend if I'm not. However, I have a way out.

 I thought meditation would lift me out of depression effortlessly, meditation is way, way more work than I had thought. You have to come face to face with yourself. But so far, I think it's been worth it. My parents have told me, unprovoked, that they see a difference in me. I feel like my personal relationships are really improving.

I sat down on my bed, this was something different than when I think before going to sleep. I tend to think before I fall asleep and try to find solutions that way, but the difference between that and this was *energy* that was present. 

I started untangling this knot of things that had developed these few months. After a while

* The job interview that went well

* A freelance assignment that I'm just starting

* My future (where I'll live/where I'll travel next year/getting a motorcycle or car/relationships)

I'll try to keep it short

Some conclusions:

- I did not discover any fears or suppressed memories. This was not a big surprise

- It was easier to 'get into the flow'

- It was easy to stay on topic

- This is way more effective than (over)thinking stuff in bed

- After I was done

- It's 21:44 in the evening but I feel like doing stuff. I can see myself doing this in the morning to get started the right way.

The reason for this was apparently quite clear to me - naturally when you spend a long time reading and looking up meditation on the Internet, every time I would TELL myself to start meditating, I would chicken out and make excuses. When I was feeling good, I would say things like ""Yeah, meditate bro, all that dark night shit is just bogus!"". When I was feeling bad and scared, however, it's not worth it

Come back to today, these thoughts of seeing suffering and becoming depressed popped into my head. So I start feeling like shit after my meditation session, but then my aunty asked how I was feeling. I don't really believe in keeping things inside, so I told her that I was feeling fearful after meditating.

And suddenly, it's the change in perception that comes with meditation. And now I realize this seeps into all aspects of my life. I tell myself I WANT to start exercising, but I never make an effort to do it. I tell myself I WANT to learn a new language, but it's always just a thought, not a goal. 

This has been an incredible insight, but now I understand that it means all sorts of insights, no matter how small.

sincere in our searches

Yet

as we turn towards that fear

and a moment of bravery

brings an end to this slavery.

As the surface drifts away

and all lights decay...

...the truth comes to play

and *life* fills that day;

beauty is its way

and we release all we could say.

All that we were

As we sink to the depths of ourselves

and freely we cast off our shells

loving every fragile impulse

discovering the ecstatic peace of the simple

the interconnection of all that is Being

Rather than try to kill my ego, I've come to accept it as a part of myself and my unique identity. The no-self belief system, while I can certainly understand its benefits, has never fully resonated with me; it's that type of puritanical mindset that has turned me off from meditation in the past. Along with being inclined towards secularism, I suppose it all makes sense why it never appealed.

Now for enlightenment, in my mind, completely defeats the purpose of being present and peaceful. I saw a post on here a while ago that said something like...

She asked me if I've ever meditated by treating my brain as if it were a muscle. She proceeded to explain an interesting mental cue that I had never considered. She said, before you start objecting, let me say that the brain is obviously not a muscle, nor does it operate in the same way--I'm not making any anatomical or biological claims here. Just pretend it does for the cue. 

I like this cue because for me one of the big things about meditation is that it discloses the unity of two entities that are normatively opposed to one another as ""mind"" and ""body."" As such

It's not that I imagine an image of my brain relaxing; rather it is that I attempt to reproduce in my skull the sensation of a relaxing muscle, but the dissolution is accompanied by a wave of relaxation across my entire nervous system. 

My dreams have for a while indicated to me that gaining control over my 'mind' is much the same as gaining control over my 'body'--I'm only beginning to understand now what these dreams mean.

At first, she isn't exposed to much English except me and television. The spirituality and philosophical stuff would confuse her and distract her so I decided I would just guide her through it myself. She needs someone to hold her hand.

We just sat on the couch. I thought sitting on the floor would be distracting (focusing too much on posture
 
- meditation is about awareness and acceptance
- don't concentrate too hard
- in most people's lives, when we meditate, we can clearly see what's going on inside of ourselves, after that, we can learn to accept all of it
- the main thing i want you to do for the next 10 minutes is look at your thoughts, the rising and falling of your chest as you breathe, the feel of your clothing, aching in your body
- if you're sad that's okay, if you start remembering bad things from long ago, that's okay, if i sneeze or cough, that's okay, if you get itchy somewhere, that's okay, whatever you feel, just look at them. 

I started by getting her to to sit up straight, out the mouth. Incoming breath energizes the body, outgoing breath relaxes the body. I took her through a body scan next, starting at the head working down to the foot. Then I took her through the ""outside"" of the body, the weight of the body on the cushion, the gentle flow of air from the fan, the feel of clothing. Next I told her to listen to any sounds, the fan

I wasn't sure what to do next, then gently let it go, don't force it away. Don't think of them as good or bad, they're all just thoughts, nothing more. We did that for maybe 2 minutes. In the middle if reminded her if you're distracted, that's okay, bring your attention back. 

Some deep breaths again

I told her to open her eyes, I feel much better. My head is different."" 

I recapped what I said before we started

She starts talking to me about things that have been bothering her, we always have control over how we feel about it, and we can train ourselves to do that with meditation. 

She got really touchy feely

She has some issues (me as well I guess), obsessively dwells on things, has mood swings, chronic headaches. She won't go see a professional, so I hope I can help her a little. 

I told her there's a place downtown we can go to learn another kind of meditation and it's open to the public. She agreed that we can go check it out (really surprising). I didn't tell her it's a Zen Buddhist temple/house because she's a devout Catholic

Here's my summary on my 10 day silent retreat if you're interested. Sorry if it's long.

     4AM and my day has started. I jump out of my uncomfortable bed and begin my morning routine, through the trees and over to the pond where I sit calmly, gazing at the stars. They’re much more beautiful out here compared to the city. As I head back to the trailer, which I share with seven other silent men, I see the older Japanese gentleman performing his ‘calisthenics’ outside. This consists of him wildly throwing his arms forwards and backwards hundreds of times. I perch 10 feet to his right and observe out of the corner of my eye as he continues this routine for quite some time, smiling to myself. What a great way to start the day!

     This retreat was definitely one of the most challenging things I’ve done in my life, no physical contact, or gestures to any of the other students. You are to act as if you are working alone. By the afternoon of my first day, I started to feel almost trapped inside my own body. “I can’t talk for 10 days? What was I thinking? I don’t know if I can do this?!” Those thoughts only lasted for about an hour, and once I got past that phase, the silence was actually very peaceful and enjoyable.

     It’s amazing how much more aware you become just from being silent. All of your senses become much more amplified. I would notice the slightly salty smell of the forest in the morning

     We meditated 11 hours a day, but incredibly delicious. We would eat breakfast at 6:30 and lunch at 11:00 with no evening meal; only tea at 5:00 with a light snack that usually consisted of an apple or a banana. Seeing as how we weren’t doing anything physically draining, my body didn’t have any issues with missing an evening meal.

     The real challenge of the 10 day course was the mental and physical pain that comes along with sitting still for long hours with no back support. The way the course progressed; we learned a few different types of meditation. We started with a technique known as Anapana, and observe it. Am I breathing more through the right nostril, or the left, or both simultaneously? Is my breath shallow or deep? How does it feel going into my nose?

     The first thing I realized was just how incredibly difficult it is to keep your attention on the breath. Our minds are uncontrollably moving from one thought to the next in such a rapid fashion. The teacher compared what we were doing to training a wild elephant. Patiently and persistently
I eventually was able to hold my attention for longer and longer periods. By the third day, and then dripped down to the top of my upper lip. I kept my focus on that bead of perspiration for 20 minutes.

      The physical pain was incredible at this point of the course. My back was aching, and it’s only day 3! This is probably one of the dumber ideas I’ve ever had.”

     Thankfully, you scan your entire body from top to bottom and simply observe the sensations that you feel in each part without reacting negatively or positively. (Tingling, vibrations, heat, cool, tension, pressure, throbbing, you were to simply observe them objectively for about a minute

     The whole point of this type of meditation is to teach you to deal with reality as it is. I learned how to look at the pain I was experiencing in my body without associating any mental attachments to it. Instead of thinking, or throbbing? Where does it start? How far up my back does it go? It was almost as if I was a doctor examining the pain on my body. Amazingly, by applying this technique, I started to see my pain slowly dissolve.

     This taught me so much about how we create unnecessary misery in our lives. Whenever something comes along in life that we don’t like

     I’ve been a worrier for a long part of my life. During the course, I was able to catch myself worrying, and instead of identifying with the worrying just examine it objectively. “How does my body feel right now? Is this something that I have the power to change right now? If not, there is no reason to give it any attention. Let’s see how long this worried feeling lasts.” I would just sit with my worry and observe it as a therapist would observe a patient. The worrying and negative feelings would also start to get weaker and weaker, and then pass soon after. Amazing! 

     I never realized how much unnecessary pain I have been causing myself. I always understood on an intellectual level that worrying doesn’t do you any good
     
     As the course progresses, and may not necessarily be pleasant to look at. Feelings of guilt, sadness, fears, etc. I had my fair share of dealing with these emotions.

     The most extreme was on the 5th day. We were about 10 minutes into a group meditation when all of a sudden some really deep-rooted fears sprang to the front of my mind. Fears about death. My whole body came to life in an extreme fashion. It almost felt like every cell was charged with an electric current. Panic consumed me, and was able to slowly bring myself back down and feel the fear become feebler and feebler. This was a huge moment! Not to say that I completely conquered the fear of death, but I was able to work through some very intense feelings and afterwards felt so great. It was as if I had been relieved of a huge burden.

     The course progressed and I continued to get stronger in my meditation practice. Sitting for an hour without changing posture became relatively easy and pain free. I dealt with smaller issues along the way and was glad I was taking the time to work on myself.
On the final day after our last group meditation, and started to realize all of the love that I have in my life. My thoughts went to my amazing family and incredible friends who actually care about me and support me. I felt so much love, and had so much compassion for everyone and everything in my life. The next thing I knew, tears were streaming down my face and I wept. I just let that feeling wash over me and I cried for almost the entire meditation. It felt so good to just let go. It was a perfect way to end everything.

     Afterwards we were allowed to break our silence
     
     This program provided an amazing opportunity for me to work on myself, I’d highly recommend this program to anyone.

And I say ""attempts"" because I never reached the deep meditation level (where your eyes start moving rapidly).  The problem is

Well a year later and with a mind more open than last, and to just accept what it is.  Also, I used to directly go into using a mantra such as ""One"" or ""Let go"", but this time choose to just use my breath as one.  I would consciously focus on each breath ""Breathing in"" and ""Breathing out"".  

I was so happy because I was appreciating each breath and even started savoring the breath which subconsciously slowed down my breathing to what seemed like the longest breaths I have ever taken in my life!

And that is a big deal for me because I have been so emotionally numb for these past two years (ever since quitting this medication for opiate addiction called suboxone...horrible med btw).  It has been hard for me to find wonder and joy in anything like I used to.

I haven't meditated properly for about 2 weeks now

For the first set of pathetic breath counts my mind was racing with erratic thoughts, I managed to say to myself in one small mindful whisper 'focus now', it was really strange, it was like a new language was learnt right there in that moment. And I got it, the moment was missing. Who I am physically and spiritually right then in this instance of now.

From then on I focused hard onto a inhale (I wasn't even keeping count at this point), up my body and out my mouth, then into nothing. 

After that first cycle of a breath I was blown away. My whole body felt like a big bag of dry cement. It was like I detuned my body and my mind was one again or something. The feeling remind me of a time I was on tripping on some psilocybins and I felt like I had eyes around every corner but standing still feeling very full

At the float spa I went to, they had me go to a waiting room with about ten massage chairs facing a waterfall wall, with light music in the background.  They asked me to sit through a 15 minute chair cycle before going into the float room.  Fine by me.  I normally don't enjoy massage chairs all that much but this one was really quite impressive.  I don't think that a machine will be able to do as good a job as a human in the near future, but this chair was definitely miles above the standard Brookstone mall-type chair.  After 15 minutes, the chair stopped, and I was ready to go to the float room.


The float chamber was attached to a shower, and by the time I was done, the motion-sensor light in the room had turned off, leaving only a soft light in the shower and in the float chamber.  In the float chamber, I pressed the button to turn the lights completely off.  I suppose some people leave them on, but where's the fun in that?


I proceeded to engage my normal meditation practice, closed, didn't matter... saw the same thing (nothing but some random abstract brain feedback).  The only sound I could hear was my breathing, amplified partially by the earplugs.  One slight annoyance was that I kept drifting into the corners of the tank.  I'd be ""in the zone,"" and then feel my fingers, elbow, toes, brush up against the edge.  I'd gently push myself way and try not to let it disturb me, but there was nothing but pitch darkness in the chamber and I still saw abstract lines and such... 

Anxiety... Generally none

At some point in my meditation, the clouds would retreat and the sun would blossom forth.  When the sun swept over I could feel the garden growing in full land lush and ripe and then dying and wilting when the world darkened and the clouds moved in.  

This went on for a long time.  It felt like years really were passing

I've never felt such a strong connection to the concept of yin/yang or light/dark.  I mean I could just feel it.  It was not a thought or an idea you read in a book.  It was a feeling.  I could feel that everything is in connection with an opposite.  I could feel my mantra become a circular entity and that my in breath was one half and my out breath was the other.

3. Finally, but I can't say I feel they control me any less. I still get angry from time to time, for instance, and all I seem to be able to do is observe my anger. It doesn't feel diminished at all.

1357073696.0,15sbbe,Isn't that kind of a contradiction?  ,PoLops,38,8,30,"Hey all

I'm a beginner to this whole meditation thing. While reading chapter 5 of *Mindfulness in Plain English*, seem to contradict with one another.

The first bit : 


**""What To Do When the Mind Wanders Away?**

In spite of your concerted effort to keep the mind on your breathing, friends not seen for a long time, a book you read long ago, the taste of food you ate yesterday, and so on. As soon as you notice that you mind is no longer on your breath, mindfully bring it back to it and anchor it there. However, in a few moments you may be caught up again thinking how to pay your bills, write a letter to someone, plan your next vacation

The second bit :

""Also, emotions, perceptions, consciousness and mental formations as well. When we experience these states, **we should forget about the feeling of breath and immediately focus our attention on these states--one at a time, not all of them at one time**. As they fade away, we let our mind return to the breath which is the home base the mind can return to from quick or long journey to various states of mind and body. We must remember that all these mental journeys are made within the mind itself.""

What am I not grasping? Hoping someone can clear this little issue up for me.

So here's how I see it :

It's all about awareness.

We are all already somewhat familiar with awareness. For example

Awareness is dynamic and amorphous. It moves like a liquid, a cloud of gas, a laser... It focuses, spreads out, assumes various shapes... In the uncultivated it is that ""drunken monkey"" ... constantly jumping here and there, restless, controlled by a hundred habits, peaceful and coherent.

(I think that awareness is our fundamental nature or fundamental ""self"". Call it ""awareness"" or ""awareness body"" ... ""soul"" or ""witness"" even. Or ""That which perceives"")

OK

---

*Meditation*

When we meditate we're flexing this ""awareness"" in a formal
We have 2 basic meditationy actions : CONCENTRATION and EXPANSION.

(Yes

In CONCENTRATION we choose an object and upon that object we focus our awareness for a length of time as perfectly as we are able. This brings stillness. The monkey chills out. We also gain clear and penetrating vision

In EXPANSION we abide, perhaps). We do not flit around like the monkey, and neither do we root ourselves upon an ""object of concentration"" - rather we refrain from ALL such flitting/focussing/attaching behavior - we just chill profoundly and reside nowhere. in this state our awareness moves in a NEW WAY : it EXPANDS, like an inflating balloon. It expands in ways that we are familiar with and a thousand new ways too. We grow from a chunk of stone into an expanding cloud. We get high, Our love expands. We see MUCH NEW STUFF, the invisible becomes visible. Our power grows. Our love grows. We gain access to the reality of infinite love and beauty.... and lots of other good stuff. It's great.

CONCENTRATION is excellent prep for EXPANSION. I use it that way alot. A lot of other people use this concentration-then-expansion approach too. It is ancient and popular.

---

*More or less equivalent terms in various traditions*

CONCENTRATION : ""samatha"" (buddhism) : samprajnata dyhana (aka ""meditation with a seed"") (raja yoga). I think the taoists just call it ""concentration"".

EXPANSION : ""vipassana"" (buddhism. Tho I hear that some people do a vipassana-in-stages thing which I am not familiar with""). asamprajnata dhyana (aka ""meditation without a seed"") (raja yoga). ""choiceless awareness"" (osho). ""formless meditation"" (ram dass). I think the taoists just call it ""meditation"".

---

*Concentration tricks*

In my experience the ""stillness"" effect is achieved no matter what ""object"" you concentrate on - HOWEVER different ""side effects"" or ""insights"" can be achieved by doing CONCENTRATION on different objects. People use breath, a candle flame, an idea, a sound ... anything really. You can also concentrate on ""channels of perception"" - that is, the whole of whatever is coming to you via one of your senses - sight, sound, taste

One BIG AMAZING trick for me is :  #1 chill out with concentration (I like to use the sensation of breath in my nose tip) #2 concentrate on my thought stream... follow the stream to it's source ......... mind==blown

When one makes an effort to be good, and therefore the demand creates the opposite. And in the opposite there is what has been. So one must be free of this incessant demand

Such a mind does not demand experience; it cannot ask for a challenge or know a challenge; it does not say, shallow mind, the conditioned mind is always seeking them more. Is it possible then to live in this world without the more - without this everlasting comparison? Surely it is? But one has to find out for oneself.

Investigation into this whole question is meditation. That word has been used both in the east and the west in a most unfortunate way. There are different schools of meditation, watch it, watch it, watch it""; there are other systems which advocate sitting in a certain posture, breathing regularly or practicing awareness. All this is utterly mechanical. Another method gives you a certain word and tells you that if you go on repeating you will have some extraordinary transcendental experience. This is sheer nonsense.

It is a form of self-hypnosis. By repeating Amen or Om or Coca-Cola indefinitely you will obviously have a certain experience because by repetition the mind becomes quiet. By repetition you can induce the mind to be gentle and soft but it is still a petty, and not to put a flower in front of it will become a sin.

Meditation is now following any system; it is not constant repetition and imitation. Meditation is not concentration. It is one of the favorite gambits of some teachers of meditation to insist on their pupils learning concentration - that is, which any schoolboy can do because he is forces to. It means that all the time you are having a battle between the insistence that you must concentrate on the one hand and your mind on the other which wanders away to all sorts of other things, whereas you should be attentive to every movement of the mind wherever it wanders. When your mind wanders off it means you are interested in something else.

Meditation demands an astonishingly alert mind; meditation is the understanding of the totality of life in which every form of fragmentation has ceased. Meditation is not control of thought, then thought will not interfere. That very understanding of the structure of the thinking is its own discipline which is meditation.

Meditation is to be aware of every thought and of every feeling, but the silence that comes when thought has understood its own beginning, the nature of itself, understood how all thought is never free but always old - this silence is meditation in which the meditator is entirely absent, for the mind has emptied itself of the past.

Meditation is a state of mind which looks at everything with complete attention, and one cannot possibly learn it from anybody, that is the beauty of it. It has no technique and therefore no authority. When you learn about yourself, watch yourself, watch the way you walk, how you eat, what you say, the hate

So meditation can take place when you are sitting in a bus or walking in the woods full of light and shadows, of habits, of following a method. Love cannot be cultivated by thought. Love can perhaps come into being when there is complete silence, a silence in which the meditator is entirely absent; and the mind can be silent only when it understands its own movement as thought and feeling. To understand this movement of thought and feeling there can be no condemnation in observing it. To observe in such a way is the discipline, and that kind of discipline is fluid, free, not the discipline of conformity.

There is no need to sit cross legged or strive for it

True deep meditation is a goal that few mention here. But there are a load of conversations about getting into padmasana or other cross legged positions.

Why?
Because we are approaching meditation from the outside

It doesn't matter what you look like or how you sit if you want truth enough. That desire is much more important than anything else.

It's not bad to desire

Blessings to everyone who is seeking joy or peace within. 
May we all find what we are seeking.",self,t5_2qnc9,1344925071.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/Meditation/comments/y6971/cant_get_into_lotus_need_help_asap/
