Afterwards, the messages were from two people. [Here](http://i.imgur.com/9WcJY.png) is my inbox, which shows the messages. I was suspicious, because 999rafica responded twice, and then I had another message saying that he just got my message to PM me.

Or maybe he was excited about pizza and wondered why I didn't respond for a couple of hours.




I ended up replying to the most-recent message, proving that the account was made specifically to fool me. I guess I wasn't too concerned about getting scammed on a subreddit that's supposed to be about giving out of the random kindness of your heart.

A little over a year ago, and with whom I'm extremely close. While she was checked in, she couldn't receive phone calls. At the same time, I ran out of money and, due to a mix up with my school, my meal plan ran out.

My friends did their best to give me their guest meals and take me out when they could afford it, but one hundred dollars only goes so far over a few months.

Finally, so I would have left-overs. I had finally gotten the courage to tell someone how scared and hungry I was, and he reached out. After that, my luck changed. My dad was able to wire me some money (he's nearly as broke as I am) and I survived the rest of the semester.

I eventually dropped out and moved home to take care of my mom and work. I live paycheck-to-paycheck in a national volunteer service so that she doesn't have to support me. And today, that same friend ordered me another pizza. People like him give me hope. I'm not at rock bottom, eating three packs of ramen a day and asking my friends to steal cereal from the dining hall. I have work and I'm learning a trade and I'm doing better.

Anyway. To all you pizza givers, and remember the pizza that got you through.

1345574647.0,yldfk,VERY Hungry family of 3 with toddler-No money until Sept 1.,Kenziekay082909,23,4,11,"I have posted a few times on here and have received one pizza from such a kind young man a few weeks ago when my family had nothing to eat. We still do not but that pizza was one of the smallest but BEST gifts we have ever received. then the next day a family offered to send us a $20 Walmart giftcard to help us get some food.

Amazing.

However we only get paid once a month and only received $1400 this month. Our money goes to bills

I do not want to ask again for a pizza

We live in a home where the lady keeps expired food in the pantry and I am talking expired peanut butter since 1992 at its worst!!!

The full pantry is misleading since all of it is expired. Plus she is never home and never brings food.

My daughter has been eating bread and I have tried to make as much as I can for her and have not eaten much myself. She comes before me always.

My husband is a veteran and VA cannot do anything to help us. We have also gone to a food bank but we do not even have the gas to get out there now and haven't for weeks.

I am very blessed to have been gifted a card and a pizza this month. I had lost my faith in humanity but those two families restored it. It is great to know that there are still some kind hearts out there. Very reassuring.

Like I said

IF THERE IS SOMEONE WHO IS IN MORE NEED AND HAS NEVER RECEIVED A PIZZA OR ANY HELP

Now I'm in that weird predicament where I want to accept one of the gifts and have a Pizza today

You guys are amazing. My eyes are leaking and I don't know why.

---

Long story short. Someone on /r/trees posted a picture of pizza. [I complained because I'm hungry.](http://www.reddit.com/r/trees/comments/1cqf0p/pizza/) (Which in hindsight I should have just stayed quiet.) This led to posts which I was sent here.

It's 4/20. Smokers everywhere across the country think it's a day to celebrate recreational smoking. I smoke occasionally for severe anxiety and depression problems.

But today I can't. I work all weekend. In addition, and no food on the shelf but a few potatoes and a pack of spaghetti noodles. I won't get to eat a full meal, and I won't get to smoke out casually. But that picture of Pizza is damn tempting, and I'm fighting off hunger pains.

I work 40+ hours a week. My roommate just lost her job and is unhelpful. My wife has medical problems and cannot work, and I smoke probably about $20 a month at most.

There are no excuses. A self sufficient man like me should be able to handle my money well enough to take care of this by myself. Due to our situation, we haven't bought more than a handful of food a month, and my car will be unusable because I can't afford repairs.

On my way to work at Wal-mart on Thursday I spotted a car parked out at the farthest end of the parking lot with the hood up.  I

It turns out that these people are actually neck-deep in a shitty situation.  

They were on their way to California from Indiana so the husband could start his job as a welder for biodiesel fuel tanks.  14 miles from my workplace their vehicle's timing belt skips and they're stranded on the interstate.  A tow truck comes and tows them 14 miles to Colby, broke, and have absolutely no way to fix it.  I ask them how much they need, they say it'll probably cost a couple hundred to fix their vehicle enough to get them going.

Maybe I'm an idiot for trusting them, at least it'll pay for a hotel and some food.  I go in, my balance is $279.15.   I withdraw $100 and hand it over.  I don't get paid for two more weeks, I'm in need of an oil change and I need fuel to keep me going on the 1-hour trip to and from work.  I'm literally running on the skin of my teeth with $179.   I pick them up a case of water to because it's goddamn hot outside and you can't sit in the sun for that long without hydration.  

I start my shift

They're still out there

I make a few more plans

I left them at the motel 6 for the night.  They'll call in the morning.

Reddit, Gods willing, but right now I've given every last penny I can spare.  I'm appealing now to you guys, at least help get them a hot meal.  They're in desperate need of help and a little kindness shown to them from strangers on the internet and maybe a good meal will help them just a little bit, just for another day.

If nothing else

I'm also somewhat artistic

I'll update in the morning.  I'm tired.

Update 1:  Sorry about that folks, if anyone wishes to donate something.  They got the tools they needed to get their belts off, which is a godsend.  I'll probably see them tomorrow and I'll get around to talking to them about local charities that might be able to give them a hand.  I should probably make sure that this is okay with them too.

Unknown to me however, they were really at home, directing the whole ordeal, while eating just about every ounce of food in my apartment. This carried on for 140 minutes, with increasing intensity

~~In the same vein, the unused potions of her house have become a stockpile of things she doesn't need, or people left, and don't want. I've been helping her clean and fix up the house, kill the roaches and mice, and try and make her life a little more enjoyable. I also spent my last dime in the process.~~

~~I'm broke and alone on this sunday, REALLY appreciate some noms :3~~

~~I also have a free steam game to offer. Payday: the Heist. Not exactly a blockbuster kind of game

Yesterday my husband hit a curb after picking me up from work and our tire burst. Three hours and $170 debt on the credit card a new tire was acquired. Only to find another tire had a nail in it.

Good Afternoon all! 

I live in England

I'm completely broke and now completely out of food. My place of employment is almost completely broke and is putting staff wages off as long as they can. 

Luckily all my bills are paid and I should be getting paid -something- early next week.

I don't have anything to offer that i'm aware of except for the idea that I will be paying it forward when I can. 

Pizza for me now is a pizza for someone else later I suppose.

Thanks for reading. I'd be surprised if anyone was able to help though given i'm outside the US but I figured its worth a try incase theres some generous UK guys or gals out there :D

We had no food in the fridge for adults and I was crushed in despair under my situation.

Then someone on /r/trees posted a delicious picture of [pizza](http://i.imgur.com/4Ec6Qyb.jpg) (My god that is still delicious looking...) which I decided to [comment on.](http://www.reddit.com/r/trees/comments/1cqf0p/pizza/c9j05w3)  Now in hindsight maybe I should have just stayed quiet but the hunger was on me something fierce. From that post, I have a [wife and child](http://i.imgur.com/Di5vxyr.jpg) and a [recently unemployed roommate](http://i.imgur.com/PnX4wnP.jpg) who are all really important to me. But I asked.

I made the post as I went in to work that night. And in my cubby box work had given me [a pair of free tickets to a certain event.](http://i.imgur.com/UnoVdlT.jpg) We'll get back to that.

So I spent work from midnight till eight in the morning waiting to see how things would turn out. I got a response from [donny_pots](http://www.reddit.com/user/donny_pots) quickly, maybe begged, for just a pizza. Just one pizza maybe, you know? Remind me what it's like to eat a fatty meal, but a filling one at that. Then a response by  [dehOne](http://www.reddit.com/user/dehOne) offering pizza. I should have said no. But it sounded like I might get two pizzas. Shame on me, I guess. Then another person [mm_kay](http://www.reddit.com/user/mm_kay) sent a pizza. 3 whole pizzas!

I did in many of these cases try to let them know that someone else already helped

Me and the wife and our daughter left to go see [muppets](http://i.imgur.com/Oh5zOUa.jpg) and watch a free show work comped me. [It was crazy and my daughter loved it.](http://i.imgur.com/VEfmQB2.jpg) I had barely enough gas to get there and back before the gas light came on

So I return home to find pizzas. Pizzas everywhere. They came while we were at the show, but I'll try and make the correct associations there.  donny_pots and mm_kay both sent me pizzas, I think three total between them. But it was dehOne who made me cry.

dehOne first sent me [this amazing spread of food.](http://i.imgur.com/xzFnycJh.jpg) which was a weekend meal enough as is, I found someone had gifted me a month of Reddit Gold.

So there you go Reddit. I asked for maybe a pizza or two. My pessimism told me no one would really help, an empty fridge, and a lot of stress I asked you guys for help. And you helped. About ten pizzas, $25 in my gas tank, a Sesame Street show (not you guys technically but I still thank you), and enough food to get us to a paycheck where we can eat real food finally.

Thank you. I love you all. Thank you so much. I feel terrible still, thank you [mm_kay](http://www.reddit.com/user/mm_kay), and thank you a big bunch [dehOne](http://www.reddit.com/user/dehOne).

Hey guys, but this Holiday season has really gotten to me.

My name's Mike, they decided they no longer wanted me and sent me back down to the cities. When I came back down, I was dropped off at my Aunt's house who wants nothing to do with me and she turned me away.

The first family I stayed with for the three years, I called a friend and his family let me stay with them for a few years so I could finish school here in town. About a year in, they get a job offer from a place in Iowa, so they moved. They offered for me to come with, but I had an offer from a friend here in town that begged me to stay and graduate with the new friends I had met at this school. I did that, but that summer they were going to have a relative move in with them, so I had to move out of there when I was 17. 

I ended up moving to a house that wasn't so good

I went unemployed for about three months or so until I started working at another game store. I really didn't like it, and I'm slowing starting to catch up on the large amount that I owe my renters from going unemployed so much. 

This Holiday season I stayed home on Christmas, unless someone would be gracious enough to order me a Pizza. 

I do have steam, you're more than welcome to have any of them.

I try not to get down, and losing a job that meant a lot to me, and just being extremely hungry, I'm feeling down.

If someone would be kind enough to get me anything, I would be forever grateful.

Meet another ""good Samaritan"", no worries. Next week. Couple weeks..couple more checks. Give me $300 for the blackjack table and I'll double it. Quit your regular day job and let's work full time together on something else. Well this leads to that, and I find myself losing my mind. I have nowhere to turn to except booze, the one that's always there for me in the end, it seems, when everyone else has betrayed. 

I land myself back in jail for a month, -$5 on my Green Dot card (all I can get now that no bank will accept me). Also ruining my eBay account, my only source of income for the past several months. Not counting the -$3000 on my PayPal SmartConnect credit line. 

Where is he to be found? Long gone. Where am I? Sitting here with no food, or that life has just beat down on its own free will. I'm in this predicament because of my actions and irresponsible behavior. Because I let life get me down and I chose the wrong solutions. I don't feel I'm as deserving of charity pizza over anyone, if anyone at all. I just wanted to come on here and say that I really didn't expect to be betrayed like this by someone I felt I could trust, and I woulda gone and gotten myself a pizza with my own money had I not been cleaned out. And then some. But alas, this is what happened, and I am sitting here penniless, can't even make money with the debt, or ever. No excuses. Just hungry, which have been far and few in between,False

I was in a really shitty place 5 months ago. No money, I've got two jobs, paying a car note, moving into my own place and assuming guardian role of my little brother (who my father also kicked out, wtf.)

Anyway

Anyway, I figure why not spread the cheer a little and get some pizza! I'll definitely do one, but I just had to pay my registration on my car and my deposit on my new apartment so I'll see how many others I can do.

BUT, delivered physically, it doesn't matter. The only catch is: it has to be something you somehow acquired/created/spawned on your own. Basically, I don't want a link to some picture from the internet or something like that. It can be a song, it can be a thank you picture, (but that's a little boring) it can be a drawing, I really don't care! Don't tell me what you're going to offer me until I accept your request

The original thread I made is [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/RandomActsOfPizza/comments/1gonds/request/) but you might not be able to see it

Here is the text:
I've been struggling lately. I'm also a student going to school full time on the GI Bill, and I'm waiting on $20 that my mom sent me but it's in the mail. I am really hungry and I have eaten all the rice and oatmeal I can stomach. If someone would help me with a pizza I would be so very grateful. When I graduate, at the end of summer, I will pay it forward whenever I can. Or if you'd rather, I could give you a giftcard to use when you fall into need, once I'm able. I've been poor for a long time and I want to give back too. Once I'm working again, I'll more than be able to afford myself.

**ORIGINAL POST:**

This may not be the right subreddit for this

I have been racking my brain trying to think of a xmas gift this year for a very dear friend of mine.  Today

She and her family have participated in the March for Babies walk every year since losing their 12-day-old baby daughter Tera back in 2001 due to a congenital heart defect.  Her FB post mentioned that any donations through the end of the year [will be matched](https://www.marchofdimes.com/giving/support_yearend.html)

I thought it would be awesome if a bunch of random redditors started donating to her [March for Babies team](http://www.marchforbabies.org/personal_page.asp?pp=3599083&amp;ct=4&amp;w=5202211&amp;u=TeamTeraUT) out of the blue.  She would be dumbfounded.  Her fundraising goal is $500

So please

So thank you all for reading this.  If you want to read up more on the charity, on her team's [donation web page](http://www.marchforbabies.org/personal_page.asp?pp=3599083&amp;ct=4&amp;w=5202211&amp;u=TeamTeraUT).

**THANK YOU!!**

As is fair

What they equated as a fair amount of work for use of my old room [which had remained empty] was to work from 7am to past 7pm; essentially to work the same amount they did, or the money to pay for my car insurance, student loan and only 10 a week, if I was lucky, for gas to go into town and apply for jobs.

Food, pbnj [sometimes] and tea. My mom thinks i'm losing weight solely because i'm working outside a lot, though the truth of it is i'm losing weight in equal portions from not having enough to eat on a regular basis.

The excessive expected work doesn't even end there. I was expected to work like this 7 days a week. Right

Eventually

I've now ruined pretty much all of my clothes via souring from being drenched in sweat for the period of a day, which will ultimately ruin my shots of getting a job since i'll have no where to go, sleep or stay clean to keep myself presentable for a job.
