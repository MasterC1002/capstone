I was having a bad day

...You gorgeous human beings give me so much hope.  
Sometimes it feels that this world is filled with only racists and homophobes and what not
You must have gone through so much pain and suffering in your life, finally in the body where you belong, and what you deserve, it makes me smile. It makes me smile so much.  
Even the toughest looking guy can be a pretty princess on the inside
It should be normal to be yourself.
  
Everyone should look up to you.  
You make the choice to be happy. And no one can stop you.  
  
You are all awesome
  
Have a nice day! :)

I'd like to take this opportunity to mention a few things about this community that you should take to heart if you wish to participate:

1. Note the rules in the sidebar

2. This is not a place to criticize those in the timelines. As the rules say

3. Don't give unsolicited ""advice"". You don't know what a person does/doesn't want to improve about themselves and it is often hurtful and unwanted when not specifically asked for. That means if someone asks for advice on hair

4. This is primarily a space for trans people to be inspired by their peers and to get a sense of validation. Respect that and don't treat us like zoo animals.

7. Do not share these timelines around without permission from the person in the picture. They are posted here in good faith that they won't be spread to places the owner doesn't want.

5. Please don't advertise this subreddit without checking with the mods first.

6. No mod sass.",self,t5_2u0oa,1357557997.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/transtimelines/comments/164446/meta_hi_new_subscribers_a_few_ground_rules/

When I first started to get erections

Even before puberty, the child me just pretended to be fat. I would often go to sleep with pillows in my clothes.

Before I could buy my own nail polish

Once, and I cried all the way home.

At the beginning of puberty, as if this talent would be useful someday. I would often talk with people over voice chat when playing video games or on a Ventrilo/Teamspeak server with a girl voice.

In highschool

I also bought tighter jeans. I would wear two pairs of jeans so that my rear and my legs would look thicker and rounder.

At this point

When I wanted to buy a Nintendo DS, I bought a pink shell and modded it myself.

I also would occasionally paint my nails.

There was a point in time where I would douse myself in lavender lotions and drink only soy milk.

I experimented with razors, and eventually settled on using an Epilator to deal with body hair. I hated my leg hair.

I went to Goodwill for the first time by myself. I rode there on a bike

I couldn’t deal with homework or school and I was depressed. When I was a kid, he passed away. I still haven’t found another therapist.

For some reason I really liked Esquire Magazine. I don’t know what that means.

At this point I had moved on from pillows to socks and shirts stuffed inside bras. I found that blowing up a rubber balloon inside another rubber balloon would work decently well. There was a terrible accident with a water filled balloon

I still wish on stars.

I never put down my gender or my real name anywhere online.

My friend got a Hello Kitty debit card. I got one too.

The first time I crossdressed in public was for a friend’s birthday/Halloween costume party. I went as a girl. I was well received. Someone asked me about it but it would take me years to come up with a female name.

A female friend of mine wanted to buy adhesive strapless bras for wearing with her prom dress. I bought two if them to stick in my bra. Then I bought another pair. Eventually

I stopped practicing guitar because my nails were often too long. I didn't want to cut them short and take off the nail polish.

I read some erotic fiction. And all of it was males were turned into females through magic or chemicals or something. The idea of turning female was extremely sexually arousing. I eventually found a lot of Japanese hentai on the subject

A friend of a friend that I knew decently well came out as gay. Then she came out as trans. I didn’t really think much of her transition. But then her also trans girlfriend moved in with her. And this new girl I was jealous of because she was on hormones.

One day I got my ears pierced. It took days for my parents to notice the placeholder rings.

I ordered new glasses online. They have stars and flowers on them and a definitely feminine outline.

I dyed my hair red. I used to spend money at salons. Now I just do it myself.

Gradually, and countless female fit t-shirts. Bras, panties, a hoodie and coat, hats, necklaces, even a cute watch.

At this point I gave up on shaving and started epilating/plucking the hairs on my face. I looked very different with shaped eyebrows. And with way less five o’clock shadow

I bought a pochette bag and tried carrying it around. It was too small and eventually I found a bag that I love and carry around every day.

I changed my wallet from brown leather to a faux leather one with sushi print. Now I have a Hello Kitty wallet.

At this point I would sometimes dress female

I looked through names one day online. I picked one that I kinda liked and I used it online. Now it’s my online name everywhere. I have my friends call me by it when I’m in girl-mode. It’s on my business cards.

More and more I would get ‘Ma’am’ed. At this point

On my 24th birthday

I imagine that a lot of other people have had similar experiences,,False,self,t5_2u0oa,1366889412.0,,True

Im 24 years old and I am finally trying to face who I really am on the inside. For as long as I can remember I have always wanted to be a girl

 As a kid I always ""dressed up"" stealing my aunts and mom's clothes I always thought this was just me being weird and that I would grow out of it but throughout the years every time I try to stop I always end up buying more girls clothing and dressing in secret. I try'd to repress this side of me I joined the military in the manliest career field I could find and just tried to forget about those secret's..Less than 6 month's later I was dressing again spending hundred's of dollars of clothing and makeup. I would then freak out throw everything away repress the feelings again and the process would repeat. I have probably spent $1500 + on women's clothing and haven't worn it outside since middle school.

This has continued up to the point Im at right now...Rock bottom basically - I have pushed everyone in my life away and only really talk to my mom.  A no-lifer if you will   my day's are filled with video games and school nothing else. I realize that I can't go on living like this but I am terrified of the next steps. 

Currently I am scared to proceed in my current state - I am 6'1 215lbs I put on 40 lbs from just pure depression in the last 1 1/2 year's.
 Me- [IMG]http://i.imgur.com/GvDIEa9.jpg[/IMG]

I have a few Questions and hopefully this will give me confidence to continue.

1. I realize that I am a bit heavy should I concentrate on losing the weight before going to a therapist or should I start the process asap?

2. Is there anything I can do PRE everything to make myself prettier? ex. I am terrified of going through the process just to look like a guy in makeup and long hair.  -  Money really isnt an Issue saved around $12000 to help with this.

3. After looking at my picture do you think I would ever pass with my bone structure and big nose?

also I am out of the military at this point. Going back to community college with a focus on IT stuff.

- Anyone who responds thank you so much It would really mean the world to me.

1373735423.0,1i84js,"So I finished my first round of voice therapy, here are the results... (hard data inside)",nikkistarzz,27,3,http://www.reddit.com/r/transtimelines/comments/1i84js/so_i_finished_my_first_round_of_voice_therapy/

The sessions were monitored by a speech pathologist (I'm assuming their teacher) and ran for 8 weeks. I plan on doing another round in September when the sessions begin again. It cost me $160 for all sessions, but that group of sessions runs for 10-12 weeks. So, it's even more bang for my buck. 

I highly suggest girls looking to improve their voice reach out to their local university and see if they have a speech therapy dept. that offers therapy to the general public. It's a way to get cheap voice therapy and also educate others on trans* things whom may never experience it otherwise. So it's a win-win really.

Here are my results after 8 sessions:

**Beginning of therapy (male voice)**

* Pitch during relaxed “ah”: **133.36Hz**
* Pitch during conversation: **132.56Hz** *(typical male: 100Hz to 130Hz)*
* Conversational pitch range: **91.07 Hz to 187.97Hz** *(typical male range: 80Hz to 165Hz)*
* Lowest pitch “ah”: **83.06Hz**
* Highest pitch “ah”: **413.22Hz**


**End of therapy (female voice)**

* Pitch during relaxed “ah”: **142.04Hz**
* Pitch during conversation: **168.76Hz** *(typical female: 170Hz – 220Hz)*
* Conversational pitch range **134.31Hz to 246.41Hz** *(typical female range: 145Hz to 275Hz)*
* Lowest pitch “ah”: **86.66Hz**
* Highest pitch “ah”: **561.80Hz**

So as you can see, will obvi keep practising! And I wish there was a way to measure resonance! If there is, and I'm not aware of it, let me know!

[It obviously still needs some work
