[This shot](http://i.imgur.com/QJw0H.jpg) should be pretty obvious

Now

The Kiana lodge is also the location of [the log](http://i.imgur.com/2QLly.jpg) where Laura washed up.  Near the log is a rather [nifty plaque](http://i.imgur.com/gXeUW.jpg).

A very short drive from the Salish Lodge is [Twede's Cafe](http://i.imgur.com/F7D8u.jpg).  This is the restaurant that they based the Double R Diner off of.  Fantastic pie

I wondered if I could start any sort of discussion about the 'prequel' film

Much loathed on initial release

I personally love FWWM; 

I adore the initial half hour with Kiefer Sutherland/Chris Isaak/Harry Dean Stanton; I love David Bowie's bizarre appearance;


Overall, almost every unreleased TP/FWWM track is now up for download for a small fee on davidlynch.com), and I think more than any David Lynch film, the sound design is absolutely stunning (and this is from a man whose work had lush sound design) It is a near perfect fusion of image and sound, all creating a weird, unsettling atmosphere.

One of the major complaints people lodge (haha) against the film is in terms of narrative...They feel that it suffers because it lacks the whimsy of the series, because that is pretty much detailed in the series.
I disagree with these three narrative complaints;
Firstly, who views the world as a wondrous place, thus the series seems bright and chirpy in places. I think this tonal shift is a brilliant move on Lynch's part, demonstrating the shifting perspectives of characters through the almost charring shift in tone.
As for the loose ends, such as the nature of the Lodges and their effect on the Northwest.
As for the grumblings of those who feel we don't need to SEE Laura's story...Well, Laura and her murder serve as a MacGuffin; throubgh Laura's death, we are allowed a window into the world of Twin Peaks; characters react to her death, many things progress as a direct result of her death. However, in the series she serves merely as a plot device narratively speaking, and in terms of character, she is an ABSENCE.
However, so heartbreaklingly sad, we wonder how we could have ever laughed at Leland's white haired, jovial antics. Rather than making her another 'Noir-esque' 'murdered girl' trope, Lynch givers her agency, flesh, makes her story tangible

I hope some people can share their thoughts? ",,t5_2rodn,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/twinpeaks/comments/10gffb/fire_walk_with_me_the_film/

&gt;Kyle MacLachlan refused to further develop the storyline about his character Dale Cooper’s relationship with Audrey Horne (Sherilyn Fenn), the relationship between Cooper and Audrey was heavily publicized in TV Guide and other entertainment magazines, akin to the press given to later TV “power couples” (such as Mike and Susan of Desperate Housewives). The move alienated audiences and caused a further decline in the show’s already suffering ratings. At the time, Kyle MacLachlan attributed his insistence to a belief that the morally upright Cooper would not date an underage girl; however, Audrey was a high school senior who, in the time line of the series, would have graduated in one to two months, the age of consent is sixteen, with whom Boyle did not get along on set.

It makes me pretty mad, perhaps that kitschy storyline with James and that woman wouldn't have been necessary to flesh out episodes.

I completely agree with Kyle MacLachlan in regards to Cooper morally objecting to a relationship with a teenage girl

You have two potential endings in my model.

Ending A is where Coop loses. It's the ending taken at face value. Coop runs

Ending B is a bit different. You need to read what's been put in front of you. Bob has been shown to play a long game. Yet in the end we see him just out himself and start screaming and raving like a maniac when there are people in the next room. He completely loses composure. The only time we have seen Bob lose composure completely is when he was caught when he was inhabiting Leland. When he was trapped.

So ending B is essentially that Coop tricked Bob and managed to trap him, the end is Bob realizing he's lost. Not celebrating victory.

I've been at home the past few days and am now on S2E07. I'm not exactly sure why I started watching Twin Peaks; I guess I'd seen the term randomly over the years enough that I decided to click Play on Netflix, so I figured I'd find the subreddit

This show is... something else. From Hawk's matter-of-fact head-nodding lines to Coop's quirks, to the mysterious and captivating theme music, references to the majestic trees, and at least up until now, wondering if there *is* in fact a supernatural element or if the mysteries are all explainable without that factor - of course, now I know that higher powers exist in the show. All the little things added in make this show unique. It's got a deeper character than just about anything else I've seen.

I love a couple episodes ago when the guys were discussing some events at the Sheriff's station with the thunderstorm outside. I love the stacked donuts arranged in a grid. I love how Jerry and Ben interact, trinkets from around the world, and the people and places he gets excited about. I love how Sheriff Truman, Cooper, and Log Lady (who taps her log along with the music) get beers together at the roadhouse. I love the cozy lodge-style architecture of many of the buildings, and how comfortable and at-east everyone seems in the Sheriff station. Every minor character that's introduced isn't purely for efficient plot points, but actually adds character to the show

It's truly rare to find a work that can really draw me in, and have tired easily of many shows.

I've subscribed to this subreddit in the hopes of immersing myself even more in the lore and mystique of Twin Peaks. Look forward to talking to you all.

Just found out Tojamura is Catherine. Knew there was something weird about that mustache. And about Leland -gasp-.

&gt; - Cooper's first vision involving the giant
&gt; - Audrey evading her father at One-Eyed Jack's with a mask
&gt; - Donna's encounter with the mysterious old woman and her grandson on her first Meals on Wheels outing
&gt; - Donna's initial encounter with Harold right after her encounter with the old woman
&gt; - Donna's discovery that the old woman and her grandson don't seem to exist

1328997803.0,pl8fy,I have started watching Twin Peaks. These are my reviews. [Pilot],misterraider,11,1,0,"This post contains spoilers of the Pilot episode.

Ladies and gentlemen, but what with the recent crack down on streaming sites as well as the difficulty in finding good streams of older, less mainstream shows that are consistently reliable, I decided to go all out and spend my real-life hard earned cash. These are my reviews.

At this point you might be asking yourself why you would want to read my reviews, people frequently tell me that I pick up on things they miss, and vice versa, so maybe you might learn something. The second reason is that I will assume most of you have watched the series in it's entirety, and I am now offering you the opportunity to watch it (again) for the first time vicariously through me. You can laugh as I fall for the same tricks you did, cry as you remember seeing it for the first time, and hopefully be genuinely informed by another person's perspective on the show.

Up until this point in my life, I made a deliberate effort to avoid all references to it over that lengthy period of time. However, it has been difficult to avoid all of the references to Twin Peaks in popular culture, and while I undoubtably missed most of them, I would often here names like ""Dale Cooper"", ""Laura Palmer"", and the show title mentioned. Suffice to say though, and I have no experience with David Lynch as a writer/director

I have heard that Twin Peaks was a seminal piece of television production, but I do not recall anythig of it. I have heard that it was partially inspired by The Twilight Zone, and went on to inspire The X-Files and Lost, as well as many others. If it is half the show that they were (at their respective primes), then it will surely be a favourite of mine.

The DVD copy of Twin Peaks that I attained proclaims to have the original broadcast pilot on it, the DVD began to play automatically and made the decision (with the intro) for me. 

**Without any further ado

At the start of this episode, there's friends, possible witnesses etc., but soon things turn very complicated. I still haven't made the connection between all of the characters yet. I don't know who is the ""main cast"", and who were guests. I don't know who will become important later. I do know that Donna is quite hot, and I hope nothing bad happens to her in the long run. However, she seems like the type of person to get herself into trouble

I love Cooper's endless enthusiasm for everything, we are to suppose that she is the Scully to his Mulder, and that he worked with her on the previous case (the girl mentioned toward the end of the episode that died one year previous if I remember correctly), but something about the way that he meticulously records everything for her to hear at a later date speaks a lot about him. Of course, there could be many possibilities here, and I'm only speculating, but I would like to state at this point that there is something curious about their relationship.

A sidenote: The chant ""The Norwegians are leaving!"" seems very Monty Python-esque

I'm not sure of the significance of the lady from Hong Kong who owns the saw mill. It is a long time since 1991, so I can assume that there is some kind of cultural divide between her (and by association the Sheriff?) and the rest of the town. On the other hand, she has lived in the town for several years and seems thoroughly Westernised, but maybe this will just serve to point out to us that people can be racist even when there is barely any difference between the two parties.

So, at the book lockers with Donna, James arrives later. I cannot remember if it is Audrey or James who says to Donna ""nice day for a picnic."" This is an obvious reference to the picnic that we find out about later, but depending on who says it could be either very plot significant, or not terribly at all.

Is Lucy (the Sheriff's secretary) the same actress who plays Patrick Bateman's secretary in American Psycho? I know I could look this up on IMDB

Donna's sister Harriet seems like a complete wackjob. I initially just thought she was an odd actress, while a killer who preys on young girls is on the loose), he then goes on to say ""I'm so glad I have a daughter like you."" Honestly, I thought both she had been portrayed as, and her father had described her as a pretty ordinary teenage girl, so this makes me wonder how much Harriet will differ from the norm (if at all).

Now, and almost alluded that they take people, or define the town's fate or something. This coupled with the (apparent, but as yet unexplored) significance of the saw mill seems to suggest there's more to the trees than they seem. Are the trees pissed off at the town for cutting them down, and are now cutting down the citizens? Or have I just watched too many M. Night Shyamalan movies? We will wait and see.
