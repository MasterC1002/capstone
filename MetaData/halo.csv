My family can't thank Bungie enough. I know that they have had a huge impact on how well my son has been recovering after his surgery.

Also

Edit: wow

Yes

Those that are concerned about kids playing an M rated game. He doesn't playyy like you or I would sit and play. He doesn't just hop on multiplayer with a headset and microphone or just start playing the campaign. I'll sit down and play a part of the campaign with him, anyway. The Spartan storyline just gets his imagination going, it's wonderful. ",,False,self,t5_2qixk,,http://www.reddit.com/r/halo/comments/16x2kx/thank_you_bungie_my_sons_transplant_surgery_and/

1352073421.0,12myt2,Twas' the night before Halo,Dewtart,3163,1335,241,"T'was the night before Halo when all through the house
Not a creature was stirring - not even a mouse.
The headsets were hung by the remotes with care
In hopes that Masterchief soon would be there.

The players were nestled all snug in their beds
While visions of melee-ing danced in their heads.
And Cortana in her circuits and I in my gear
Had just rested our hands for a long Infinity year.

When out on the map there arose such a clatter
I sprang from my spawnpoint to see what was the matter.
Away to my base I flew in a Ghost
And cursed at the host.

The moon on the breast of the new forming ennies
Gave a luster of midday to the Flood down below.
When what to my bloodshot eyes should appear
But a brand new Warthog and new Forrunners to fear.

With Cortana going rampant and going insane
I knew in a moment - get ammo and quick!
More rapid than needles his coursers they came
And he whistled and shouted and called them by name.

Now Hunters! Now Jackals! Now Grunts and Elites!
On Brutes! On Forrunners! On Floods little treats!
To the top of crane! To the top of the wall!
Now crash away

As dry shrapnel that after explosions fly
When they meet with an obstacle mount to the sky
So
With a Scorpion full of ammo knowing full what to do.

And then
The cursing and shrieking of each red/blue mourn.
As I drew my light rifle and was turning around
Down the Masterchief came with a bound.

He was dressed all in armor from his head to his toe
And it was tarnished and damaged from battles we know.
A bundle of weapons he had flung on his back
And I wanted to kiss him in spite of his sack.

His face
He truly was a sight to behold.
He had broad shoulders and confident stance.
I thought to myself - gotta get some of those pants!

With a flick of his wrist and a swipe of his hand
4 Plasma Grenades at my feet did land.
And a Shotgun
And I knew that a Mantis soon would be found!

Then tapping his mask with the tip of his gun
I knew it was time to start having some fun
He sprang to his Warthog - to his captors gave a whistle
And away they all flew as if they were hit with a pistol.

But I heard him exclaim as they drove out of sight

What is wrong with Halo 4

- Asymmetrical maps everywhere; **but no** single-flag or one-bomb. Nope. Only Two-Flag, etc.) in CTF. Imagine if Halo 2 had *only* Two-Flag with as many asymmetrical maps as it did. Two Flag Burial Mounds, anyone? 5v5 Two Flag Ascension? Two Flag Ivory Tower? Hell, I probably would have hated Zanzibar if it was 5v5 Two Flag. Get out of here with that nonsense.

- **Lack of variety** (No Assault, no Team Snipers, no Team Doubles, no Action Sack, no Hardcore). This is what usually happens: I play two, maybe three rounds of Infinity Slayer, then back out to the Playlist menu, trying to pump myself up for something, so I just turn off my console.

- Maximum player lists for matchmade games are **not optimized;** 10 players in CTF

- So many large maps

No 8v8 One-Flag CTF Longbow? No CTF Shatter? No 8v8 CTF Exile? Hell

If I were to post this a month before the launch of Halo 4; I would have been laughed at -- no one would believe it -- it's like a bad joke.

I think the maps are great

**Edit:**

Great responses and discussion; I have read and upvoted *all of them*. /u/cmart1987 messaged me 343i's email address and I have decided to send them a personal email with this thread. I think many of you should do the same.

So as you may have noticed

We would like to know what you think of this change. /r/borderlands has been doing the same thing since the release of Borderlands 2 in September

/r/trees has been doing a self posts Sunday that everyone there seems to enjoy. I am wondering if that will be a good step, here are two options.

* Keep it self posts only. Bring back Custom Weekends and other weekly ""events"".

* Have day(s) dedicated to self posts and discussion. Possibly a ""Self posts Thursday"" (day after the Bulletin so there'll be something to talk about) or possibly a self post weekend. Still bring back Custom Weekends.

We'll also be adding more options for link flair down the line. And as for the SR 51-130 flair,False,self,t5_2qixk,1353269785.0,important,CSR-22,t3_13eitz

As an avid designer of custom games

The specific lack of the ""Race"" gametype and the player's extremely limited ability to alter ""Flood"" are particularly damning.

Some of the most popular custom games from previous Halo games such as ""Predator""

... and not including ""Race"" after the Racetrack community absolutely exploded in Halo: Reach is going to be more than aggravating for some.

[Update] I've added links to clarify on why some of these issues are on the list.

General

* ~~You can only be on 4 teams(compared to 8 in previous games).~~ This was incorrect.
* You can't view the campaign terminals ingame; you must go to waypoint.
* Can't hold the back button and move around at the same time.
* Scrolling through players in the scoreboard is more difficult.  Instead of holding back and using the right analog stick to move through them
* The indicators for your teammates' statuses aren't as clear as they used to be.  Teammates no longer show an X over their corpse.  You can no longer tell if a teammate is shooting(yellow in previous games).  When a teammate is being shot
* [Added] Can't view which secondary weapon you're holding.  [See here](http://www.reddit.com/r/halo/comments/12zhkg/a_comprehensive_list_of_halo_4s_shortcomings/c6zovoa?context=3)
* ~~[Added] No longer shows an icon ingame to indicate who is talking.~~

Custom Games

* Removed the ability to make any variant of CTF other than Multi-flag CTF.  This means 1-Flag and Neutral Flag don't exist anymore.  I don't think you can trick forge into getting them to work either
* Can't make it so you can drop the flag.
* Can't disable sprint.  [See here](http://www.reddit.com/r/halo/comments/12zhkg/a_comprehensive_list_of_halo_4s_shortcomings/c6zifor?context=3)
* Can't turn off/on instant-respawn.  It's off in CTF and Dominion
* Respawn time is a mostly irrelevant setting with instant respawn time not being toggle-able.
* Can't modify CTF to have to hold a button to pick up the flag.
* Can't make assault how it used to be.  If you use Grifball to make Assault
* Removed Race, Headhunter, and Juggernaut.  Some of these were removed because of redundance, but other than for territories, you can't make anything like them anymore. You can't make stockpile at all.  You can't make headhunter at all.  You can't make Juggernaut how it used to be.  You can rig together a race gametype using KotH.
* Can't modify Flood in any meaningful way.  The flood are required to have their three base loadouts with thruster pack
* Except for slayer
* [Added] Weapons you place down on the map physically(without using the ordnance system) won't show up in some gametypes(slayer pro, CTF).  There is also no option to turn the 'weapons on map' setting on/off, unless you're messing with initial ordnance.
* [Added] Can no longer create your own power-ups.
* [Added] When setting extra points for a headshot kill in a slayer gametype
* [Added] Can no longer change the oddball scoring mechanic.

Forge

* Can't use precision moving anymore(pushing the left thumbstick down in Reach)
* Can't zoom in anymore.
* When placing objects inside/near walls on Ravine(possibly on other maps)
* When using magnets to align objects
* ~~You can set objects to belong to teams 5 through 8
* You can set objectives to belong to a neutral team
* You can set 'symmetry=true/false' on objects
* [Added] Magnets can't snap to angles.
* [Added] The 'reloading shift glitch' was not fixed.  [See here](http://www.reddit.com/r/halo/comments/12zhkg/a_comprehensive_list_of_halo_4s_shortcomings/c6zhhqk)

Theater

* You cannot view campaign or spartan ops replays.
* [Added] Unable to view replays with friends.
* [Added] In film clips

Split-screen

* Bad framerate lag on half of the maps, Vortex, Exile, and Relay(not in matchmaking).  Any map made entirely of forge pieces or uses a decent bit of forge pieces lags considerably in split-screen.  The pre-made maps for Erosion and Ravine do not seem to lag.
* The HUD is cluttered.  In CTF
* Plasma grenades do not glow until you are very close to them.
* [Added] In Spartan Ops

Campaign(No spoilers)

* [Added] Removed point scoring.  As a result

Matchmaking

* [Added] Can't search for matches based on best connection(international players being matched with the US playerbase).",self,t5_2qixk,1352670572.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/halo/comments/12zhkg/a_comprehensive_list_of_halo_4s_shortcomings/

It all started with this ['harmless'](http://www.reddit.com/r/halo/comments/15ra4j/does_anybody_have_an_extra_halo_specialization/) post saying that he's looking for someone to give him a specialization code.  He already deleted the post but it still shows his [name](http://i.imgur.com/MYTNA.png) in my comment history.

At the time I thought nothing of it but then 20 minutes later

 
I was started to figure that something was up since I didn't lose any karma when I got downvoted so I called him out on him for making new accounts

An hour later I saw another [specialization code thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/halo/comments/15ricd/anybody_have_an_extra_specialization_code_for_sale/c7p51al?context=3) and it looks it was made by another new account.  This one seemed 'normal' at first but I found it sort of shady that this brand new account copied and pasted word for word [this thread's description](http://www.reddit.com/r/halo/comments/15qtsl/does_anyone_have_a_extra_specialization_code/) on his post.    I included all 3 of these together because they were made hours within each other and they all seemed shady to me.


**Onto the next day**

This morning I logged into Reddit and saw that there was [another thread about Specialization codes](http://www.reddit.com/r/halo/comments/15s3mt/does_anyone_know_where_i_can_find_or_buy_halo_4/)...  I once again warned people to be wary about who you're trading with.  An hour later I got this [message from Disco Dorito.](http://i.imgur.com/PrXuv.jpg) I looked at his profile and what do you know?  [His motto mentions Denzel](http://i.imgur.com/wQ32I.jpg) which ties him to the new account (agressivedenzel) that was just created this morning. 


Disco Dorito was the guy who started [the first thread asking for a Specialization code](http://i.imgur.com/MYTNA.png) yesterday

I asked him how he even got in touch with me

I sent one last message to him asking him why he is making all these threads and [he replied to me pretty much saying that it doesn't even matter anymore since a Redditor just gave him a code

I contacted the Redditor who supposedly gave him the code and [he told me that he didn't give it to him](http://i.imgur.com/0S45D.jpg) which means that he lied to me so I would give up on his attempts to steal codes...

He has now blocked communications with me

First off what is an API? As stated by Ruben Gilbert aka [@ManiiaDaWiz](https://twitter.com/ManiiaDaWiz) on Twitter:

""API stands for ""Application Programming Interface"".  The title is almost self-explanatory.  It is an interface that developers make that have predefined methods that allow users to gather data from some computer/server/program.  


In lamens terms, etc) to have a way to gather stats from the Waypoint stats accumulator.  Bungie had one for it's Halo games, but when 343i took over Halo, they didn't implement an API so gathering stats got rather difficult since everything had to be done pseudo-manually.   


The API wouldn't only have to be for stats, such as viewers, followers, channel views, and the chat box along with the stream itself.""

 

By providing an open API for Halo 4

By allowing other communities and sites to track and compare stats 343 Industries will not only create continued overall support for Halo 4

Allowing people to track and compare stats encourages competitiveness as well as continued

If 343 Industries does not provide an open API for Halo 4 stat collection

Please help and show your support for Halo 4 and the entire Halo community. Please sign this petition and share this with everyone everywhere.

**What is this?**

This is a timeline for the Halo universe created by Bungie and inherited by 343 Industries. It includes a chronological list of events in the Halo universe. Information has been taken from nearly every Halo media and compiled into an easy to explore timeline for the convenience of Halo fans everywhere!

**My motivation for creating this timeline**

There are a number of good Halo timelines out there, but they require loading individual pages for each year, and there are many many years to look through. So, I decided to make one that included as many of the important dates and events as possible on a single page for everyone to see.

**What should this timeline be used for?**

My main hope is that this timeline will be used as a reference for discussions about the Halo universe and the events that take place in it. I hope that if there is ever a debate about a battle or birthday or death

I also hope that it will be used for general learning. Scroll through and I guarantee that you will learn *at least* 5 new things about the Halo universe. Possibly even dozens or hundreds depending on your knowledge.

**I see a spelling mistake / I noticed you are missing &lt;Event&gt; / I think that isn’t true

Leave a comment or send me a PM and I will reply to you! If it is a spelling mistake I will change it right away.

If you are looking to add some information please provide the date

If you think some of my information is incorrect

If you are looking to make an aesthetic change, then please leave a comment or send me a PM and we can discuss it.

However

We have valid reasons why we don't like certain aspects

****

I decided to post this thread after reading through [C0deReader's excellent post](http://www.reddit.com/r/halo/comments/14b9rs/i_feel_as_though_i_should_post_this/).

&gt;Honestly

This subreddit seems to have two main groups of players clashing heads:

* **Classic** - This group prefers the older Halo titles (Halo:CE
* **Modern** - This group is fine with new additions and changes

The problem I'm seeing on this subreddit is that the **Modern** group is confused about why the **Classic** group isn't enjoying Halo 4 as much as they are. This leads to labelling players ""Entitled"" or ""Whiners""

I'm going to try to explain the Classic group's point of view in the context of how things have changed

****

From Halo:CE through Halo 3 (even Reach to some extent), medium paced, team based arena style combat. That's the style of play Halo has always had up until Halo 4.

The main problem Classic players (myself included) have is that we never asked for changes to the core gameplay. We have embraced any addition that didn't shift the core gameplay; New maps, improved graphics, forge...etc. We bought into and enjoyed that same style of play over and over because the core never changed. Each additional game just enhanced the same style of play.

&gt;We're the school of thought that ""**If it's not broken

Halo 4 currently deviates way too far from that style of gameplay that we have bought, Halo 4 attempted to fix something that wasn't broken, and ending up breaking the core thing that we enjoyed about the franchise.

****

Now the additions and changes Halo 4 made aren't good or bad by nature. They are just different. Whether you like the changes is very subjective

However

1. **Sprint enabled by default**
****
Having the ability to sprint and not shoot at the same time changes the dynamics of encounters. In Reach and Halo 4, meaning maps need to be expanded to make movement more comfortable. Small symmetrical arena based maps aren't as feasible. Also not being able to disable sprint in custom games negates the playability of a lot of the smaller classic maps.

2. **Loadouts with various options**
****
One of the things that separated Halo from other FPS franchises was the lack of ""Classes"" or ""Loadouts"". In previous titles, same methods of movement. This made engagements and combat equal and predictable. Teamwork, map control, and power weapon control (via controlling the map with teamwork) were the deciding factors to winning battles. Now in Halo 4 (and Reach to a lesser extent), battles can be decided by the loadouts the players are using, even if the players are of equal skill. The amount of variability that loadouts add to the game aren't bad, but it makes for much more ""random"" or ""chaotic"" scenarios when you consider the combinations. Personally I think Halo 3 implemented this type of feature perfectly, meaning teams needed to battle for the control of them as well.

3. **Ordinance (Personal and Random)**
****
With the exception of the initial ordinance drops on certain maps, and what will drop, it makes map control a less prominent part of the game. Personal ordinance is such a huge divergence from the ideologies of the previous Halos as well. Previously no single player or team was given an advantage without the ability for the opposing team to have equal opportunity to get that same advantage (timed power weapons, power-ups..etc). Personal ordinance breaks this rule, and it breaks it on an individual level. Not only does it give players that are already ahead a bigger advantage, but currently the ordinance doesn't take into account deaths or any other negative action.

4. **Map Selection and Design**
****
Halo 4 differs from previous titles here as well. It has a strong focus on larger, Halo 4's current maps are much more cluttered with obstructed view lines. Along with sprint and jetpack, not only did the maps need to expand so movement is comfortable, but they also expanded vertically. This means that engagements are separated over multiple vertical ""planes"", and makes team shooting and other tactics harder or not possible to do. Simply put, this isn't enough to please the Classic crowd as it takes away from the smaller symmetrical arena style maps that Classic players enjoy. The small initial map offering is a big reason why Halo 4's population is looking like it will dip below Reach numbers. http://halocharts.com/2012/chart/dailypeakpopulation/all

5. **Fixable Issues (that are currently unresolved)**
****
There are plenty of smaller issues that can and should be fixed: 

* Ranked Playlists
* 'X' indicator on death
* Instant respawn
* Zoom-in crosshair delay
* Ordinance mislabeling
* Ability to change which map you voted for (Maybe limit it to 1 change only)
* Option to disable sprint in custom games
* Integrate community forge maps into matchmaking
* Ability to watch theatre films with multiple people
* Fix frame rate in split screen
* Multiple fixes in forge
* File Browser + File Share

Those are just the ones I pulled off the top of my head

It's a combination of all of these issues added onto the various heavily requested features that were never delivered with Halo 4 that makes it less enjoyable for the Classic group. For example:

* Dedicated Servers
* Connection
* Icon labelling which player is host
* K/D spread or ratio in the in-game scoreboard
* Website with detailed statistics (Waypoint is a step backwards from Bungie.net)
* Open up the statistics feed for third party stat sites
* Ability to retexture forge objects (not just slight color adjustments)
* Finer and more in-depth settings for custom gametypes (Individual weapon spread

****

So next time you see someone voicing their opinion on Halo 4 (or any game for that matter)

Whether you like the game or not

****
**Halo 4 has the worst map selection at launch - Here is why**
****

First, and what was remade either in Forge or as a standalone map in later titles.

Legend:

(S) - Symmetrical design (based on the top down view)

(F) - Forge created

(*) - ""Community Favorite""


**Halo CE - 13 maps at launch**
****
&gt;Small-Medium - 77% of maps:

&gt;* Battle Creek (S)(*)
&gt;* Chill Out
&gt;* Chrion TL-34
&gt;* Damnation
&gt;* Derelict (S)(*)
&gt;* Hang 'Em High (*)
&gt;* Longest (S)
&gt;* Prisoner
&gt;* Rat Race
&gt;* Wizard (S)(*)
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Large - 23% of maps:
&gt;
&gt;* Blood Gulch (S)(*)
&gt;* Boarding Action (S)
&gt;* Sidewinder (S)(*)




**Halo 2 - 12 maps at launch - 2 remakes**
****
&gt;Small-Medium - 58% of maps:
&gt;
&gt;* Ascension
&gt;* Beaver Creek (Battle Creek) (S)(*)
&gt;* Colossus (S)
&gt;* Foundation (S)

&gt;
&gt;* Burial Mounds
&gt;* Coagulation (Blood Gulch) (S)(*)
&gt;* Headlong
&gt;* Waterworks
&gt;* Zanzibar (*)




**Halo 3 - 11 maps at launch - 1 remake**
****
&gt;Small-Medium - 73% of maps:
&gt;
&gt;* Construct (*)
&gt;* Epitaph
&gt;* Guardian (*)
&gt;* High Ground
&gt;* Isolation (S)

&gt;* The Pit (S)(*)
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Large - 27% of maps:
&gt;
&gt;* Last Resort (Zanzibar) (*)
&gt;* Sandtrap
&gt;* Valhalla (*)




**Halo Reach - 10 maps at launch - 1 remake - 1 Forge**
****
&gt;Small-Medium - 67% of maps:
&gt;
&gt;* Boardwalk (*)
&gt;* Countdown (S)(*)
&gt;* Powerhouse
&gt;* Reflection (Ivory Tower) (*)
&gt;* Sword Base
&gt;* Zealot (S)

&gt;
&gt;* Adrift (S)
&gt;* Abandon (S)
&gt;* Haven (S)
&gt;* Solace (S)
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Large - 60% of maps:
&gt;
&gt;* Complex
&gt;* Exile
&gt;* Longbow (S)
&gt;* Meltdown (S)
&gt;* Ragnarok (Valhalla)
&gt;* Vortex


**What's it all mean?**
****
What stands out to me is the fact that Halo 4 launched with **only 4 Small-Medium maps**. If you look at the ""Community Favorites"" (neglecting remakes) from the previous games

That leaves the remaining 60% of the Halo 4 maps as Large maps! Seeing as how the majority of games are played with 8-10 players

With the increase in performance and storage of the Xbox 360

343i needs to understand that the distribution of maps at launch play a huge role in the games future success. Starting off with only 10 maps (that are large by majority)

I think everyone would of preferred if they had made an additional 5 maps instead of implementing Spartan Ops and all of the different armour permutations.

**TL:DR;**
****
Halo 4 has less maps at launch than Halo CE, only 4 are Small-Medium in size. Large map majority and lack of selection makes Halo 4 have the worst map selection at launch.
****
This took a while to compile and format

Usually I avoid assassinating because it takes too long and makes you vulnerable, especially in radar-less gametypes. This might make it a bit of an incentive to perform one.

(Note: Any other canon questions you guys come up with will also put on this list

* Why the hell are we fighting the Covenant again? Didn't we make peace with them in Halo 3?

----- The thing you have to realize is that there are still a lot of religious Elites who don't believe what the Arbiter has told them about the true nature of the Forerunners; for these fanatics, whom while no longer religious, still want to kill all humans simply because they see us as competition. One of these nonreligious Elites, Jul 'Mdama, finds a colony of uber-religious Elites which had lost contact with the rest of the Covenant about a year before the war ended. This colony becomes the core of the Covenant faction that we fight in Halo 4.

* Who the hell are the Librarian and the Didact?

----- They were first introduced in the [Halo 3 terminals] (http://haloterms.bungie.org/) (if you read them on a non-Legendary difficulty level). Basically, ecology, medicine, etc. Didact is not too fond of humans (having fought a war against them), while the Librarian thinks they could be the next group to inherit the Mantle (she's the reason why humans can access otherwise forbidden Forerunner technology). Didact does not want to use the Halos, while the Librarian thinks there is no other choice. Also, according to the [description for Silentium](http://www.halopedia.org/Halo:_Silentium), and the Didact's consciousness implanted in the body of a younger Forerunner. More details can be found in the novels Cryptum, Silentium has not yet been released

* Wait

----- Oh yeah, humanity had an interstellar empire which almost equaled that of the Forerunners in technological sophistication. Also, we were allied with the Prophets, who were also uber-advanced. However, this alliance then came into contact with the Flood, so we started invading Forerunner worlds in an attempt to get away (like how Germanic barbarians rushed into the Roman Empire to get away from the Huns). The Forerunners weren't too happy about this, and since humanity and the Prophets ended up fighting a two-front war, since they surrendered earlier, and the few survivors were pretty much shoved back into Earth. 

----- The Mantle is basically the Forerunners' belief that they are to be the stewards of the galaxy

* Precursors? 

----- Introduced in Halo 3's Bestiarum, but were mostly wiped out in turn, and the remains of their technology were destroyed when the Halos were fired.

* What's the Bestiarum?

----- In-universe, and it came with the bonus DVD you got the Legendary edition. 

* What's Halsey doing in the prologue? I thought she was stuck on Onyx? 

----- In the novel Glasslands, manage to escape with help of some Engineers and an ONI search team. Last we saw of her, she was on the Infinity, though that doesn't seem to be the case anymore.

* What's with the Spartan-IVs?

----- Unlike with the IIs and IIIs, known simply as Spartan.

* Wait

----- At least 4 other active-duty Spartan-IIs (Fred, and Naomi) survive the war with the Covenant. There are also at least 11 others (Douglas, Jerome, Alice, Jai, Adrianna, Mike, Black-Two, since they were stationed elsewhere when Reach fell. 

----- As far as the surviving IIIs go, Mark, Olivia, the 5 members of Team Katana, and an unknown number of others from Gamma Company. Jun also might have survived, though seeing as he's absent from the 2010 reprint of First Strike, we don't actually what happened to him after Halo: Reach.

* What happened to the people vaporized by the Didact?

----- If you remember from the game

* So how do the Spartan IVs compare to the IIs in terms of strength and speed and abilities and stuff?

----- It's sort of unknown at the moment; it'll depend on how much the augmentations have improved and how stringent the selection criteria for the IVs are compared with their predecessors.

* So what happened to all that technology created by the prehistoric interstellar humans?

----- As mentioned in an earlier question

* So was the Composer ever used on the Flood?

----- Yes

* Why do the Forerunners call themselves the Forerunners? Seems like a weird way to refer to themselves.

----- They called themselves such because they thought another race would eventually inherit the Mantle from them, they could be quite reluctant to let ""lesser"" races take control.

* How did John survive that nuke on the last level?

----- That one's still being debated. It sort of seems that Cortana either ""digitized"" him temporarily (though that would be require her to be better at doing so than the Forerunners themselves), she might have used the light bridge to do so; the ""room"" Chief is in has the same pattern as the bridge.

* Why did the Librarian think the Chief was special

----- As mentioned earlier

----- She makes him immune to the effects of the Composer


* About your first question; so why is this fanatical Covenant faction on Requiem?

----- Simple; Jul 'Mdama not only wants to find more Forerunner technology

* So what was that beam in the last level? What planet was it shooting at and what was happening in general? 

----- Basically

* How did living things survive the firing of the Halos?

----- Basically, that were located outside the Halos' range of fire.

* Wait

----- Basically, with Forerunners wanting to find a true cure in case the Flood ended up being extragalactic in origin.

* How did the Librarian and the Didact survive the Halos firing?

----- The Didact was shoved inside a Shield World (Requiem)

----- Also, we don't know if it's the original or some sort of copy.

* Wait

----- Well

----- Another theory would be that Guilty Spark was a few chocolates short of a Reese's Peanut Butter Cup; the Halo CEA terminals show that he was so mad with loneliness that he was randomly venting the atmosphere on Halo for shits and giggles

----- Another idea is that Guilty Spark might be speaking metaphorically; the Chief was to ""reclaim"" the Forerunners' legacy and become one of them in spirit. 

----- However,000 years ago and that Chief's a Forerunner because he's ""misreading"" the genetic code/command that was placed into the Chief's ancestors.

----- Related to that

* What was the Didact doing in Requiem for 100

----- Before they shoved him inside Requiem

* But doesn't being in a Cryptum for too long screw with your body?

----- Yep, plus the preservative effects of his armor, might have kept his body more intact than it otherwise would have been.

* How does Covenant technology work?    

While it's still never been mentioned how they reload/recharge their plasma-based weapons (it was a running joke in the Bungie games that the UNSC was forever stumped by this)

* When/how does the Didact have force powers? 

----- That's actually the Didact using a constraint field (basically some sort of energy field used to restrain people); Cryptum mentions that all Warrior-Servants (the Forerunner military caste) could generate them at will.

1353226395.0,13e4d0,The Master Chief no one is talking about.  Spoiler,scottcmiller,736,155,312,"I've been thinking a lot about how Halo 5 and 6 are going unfold

The Liberian has altered MC's DNA

343i really skims over the details of the alterations the Librarian made on MC.  All we positively know is he is immune to the composer (which is a huge deal, through MC and Cortana's conversations, to really go into no detail, is really telling to its true importance.

Obviously none of us can really know where they are going with this, has become humanity's key to becoming The Reclaimers, and attaining the Mantle, as the Precursors intended.  I'll point out a couple pieces of dialogue from the game to back this claim up. 

1.  In the Intro, our destiny as a species. Do not underestimate them, but most importantly, do not underestimate him.""  This to me is the give away.  The Intro always seemed truly out of place, and I always felt like its context was much greater than just Halo 4.  We have to remember this is the Intro for an entire trilogy, not just one game, and those are some very

2. The Librarian backs up the importance of the quote above in a Myriad of ways.  Her entire dialogue with the Chief confirms that Halsey is right on the money, but also HIS AI, WHO IS A CLONE OF HALSEY.  So her work / thinking is what has satisfied the work of the Librarian.  So indeed, her claim the Spartans are our species destiny holds significant value.  

3. The Didact, ""Man has yet to attain the Mantle.""  Yet, with the help of the Librarian, how much longer will this be so?  Obviously Chief does not have the Force-like abilities that the Didact does EDIT: *(Yes, they are Amor Abilities, but the creation of such technology is only possible by species who are genetically Superior.  Humans are superior (in real life) to all other species on our Planet because of our genetic superiority: an inherent ability to manipulate our environment (create technology), and use it to protect ourselves.  Better technology allows for higher reproductive success

4.  ~~Here's the one I cannot believe people haven't been more confused about...  SPARTAN IV's HAVE PROMETHEAN VISION in war game, and correct me if i'm wrong, the simulated training missions on Infinity take place after Halo 4, thus whatever the Librarian did to Chief has been reversed engineered and used on the other spartans.~~  EDIT:  PV is an armor ability, but the final cutscene is interesting in how everyone seems to be rushing to get MC's armor off, while the Didact is giving a speech about how Humanity is the great threat the forerunners face.  This could be VERY metaphorical to Chief being reborn as a true Reclaimer of the Mantle / Evolving.  Like a snake shedding his skin and becoming a new.  

5.  Finally, and we are beginning to reach such genetic superiority that would allow for us to attain AND HOLD the Mantle.
*In order to Attain the Mantle, which pushed back its inevitable attainment of the Mantle.  Thus Humanity much reach a point in which its technology is capable of this. Ideas (superstructure) cannot exist without Infrastructure (Tangible things that allow for ideas to manifest into action)*


Now for how this will play out in this Trilogy. I don't think Humans are going to catch up with Forerunners overnight, we've never seen ANYTHING like that.   So, I believe this Trilogy will basically be about us getting to a point where we begin to  Attain the Mantle and become equal with forerunner tech.  Reclaiming our rightful place in the Universe.

Lastly, Halo has a long future ahead.  Halo 7+ I believe will be MUCH more futuristic.  Basically back at where things were when the Flood made us run for it.   It would almost be an entire new game, but with such amazing, deep, and complex lore to back it up.  The possibilities become endless, and the integrity of the Halo Universe would become concrete.  It wouldn't feel like milking at all.  It would feel genuine, and would almost most definitely bring back that indescribable feeling of mystery and discovery the first time you immersed yourself in Halo:CE.

1352868884.0,135zty,John 117's Total Networth,,593,87,223,"Quick thought experiment calculating The Chief's effective income and  networth. 


So let's start by calculating John's most recent salary information: 

As of 2557 the Chief is a Chief Petty Officer of the Navy who has effectively served for 40 years (Born in 2511

Using today's payscale

He also gets an additional $225 in combat pay and an additional $375 for performing hazard duty (Maximum of two additional bonuses). This translates to $7200 a year in extra income. Which brings the Chief's totals to just shy of $100k. Given his epic kickass status

To calculate his *effective* **civilian** pay

So the Chief makes 6 figures and enjoys quite a few additional bonuses for being in the active military

Assuming a linear progression from E-1 since his recruit days(when he was making a measly $18k a year),000. 

Now

As a side benefit of being in the military, and earns him a combined total of $4 million over the course of 40 years. 

Good grief! He is now worth $6 million dollars! That retirement home is looking good

But wait

Again

A gradual increase in income from 18k to 100k equals to an annual increase of just over 6.5%.  

Which means the annual increase in returns is calculated as: 

Sum[18000(1.065*1.04)^n -Sum[10000(1.04)^n 

and the net of that geometric series is roughly $7.5 Million

Add them all together and we arrive at the Chief's retirement nest egg of $13.86 Million. Nice. 

It's almost enough to run his armour for 30 seconds! 
 

This has been your daily dose of totally useless bit of knowledge!

Trivial information man - *away!*

EDIT: Frequently Asked Questions (Moved from top)
-------------------------------------------------

**Why make this list?**

The game itself doesn't tell you how to get these armor pieces until you're already making progress. If you have a piece that you really want

**HOW DO SPECIALIZATIONS WORK?**

Specializations are unlocked when you reach max level (50). Then you pick one, and get to pick a new one to work on. They're Halo's ""prestige"" system, more or less. Leveling it unlocks the armor pieces as you go. Each specialization unlocks an armor set, a skin for that armor, a weapon skin, a custom visor color, and the specialization ability. These are loadout abilities which are very good and can only be acquired by leveling your specializations. Normally you only start with 2 specs available

**I didn't get the Mark VI unlock even though I bet the game on Legendary! What gives?!**

Some people have complained they beat the game and didn't unlock this. Check your Legendary Commendation. The servers were probably down and you probably missed credit for 1 or 2 levels

Confirmed : You can get the Mark VI if you complete some missions solo and some co-op.

**How do I switch between different skins?**

Alternative ""skin"" patterns for weapons and armor are treated as seperate items which perform the exact same as the normal items. For example, you will have both available as options. Anything with FRST or AEON after it is a skin.

**How do I unlock the Chest piece / Shoulder piece?**

Most of these will unlock a helmet

**How do I get X Master Commendation?**

Commendations can be viewed and tracked from the player menu where you can choose your loadout and armor, and Master is the final rank for each.

**Is this everything?**

Probably not. There's at least a few skins not on this list, but try not to get your hopes up too much. These are all the same sets that were shown off before the game was released.",Unlocks,False,self,t5_2qixk,1352818420.0,28,

You see, some people insist on using it as their own personal moving barricade, or they have convinced themselves that they are ""supporting"" the wraith like it's a tank in a WWII movie.  It's not.  It requires space to maneuver so that it can reposition itself in case predators like banshees and warthogs have approached it from behind.  It must also do this to avoid plasma pistol wielding human poachers.  You see, Exile and Vortex are hardly hospitable sounding places, and life for the wraith is hard.   Everyone is gunning for that sweet hero status as the guy who took one down, so it must always be on it's guard while it's racking up it's 20+ freebie kills.


Now, then prepare to get run over, because if you've ever driven a wraith, you know that you can list lazily to the left and crush pretty much everything (no boosting required).  It's like swimming next to a blue whale.  Yes, the blue whale means you no harm, but if you insist on swimming right next to it's flippers, the whale will not be held responsible if you are crushed and drown.  


So, and if you insist on being a helpy helper person, just shoot those poachers right off it's back, and together we can preserve the wraith and win a game through good ole fashioned vehicle whoring.  Thank you.


Seriously though, take your power weapon and hop back in my wraith, because you're obviously too stupid to have said power weapon.  The End.

1) Scoping with the railgun: as you should know, your Spartan still has his binoculars. If you go into your binoculars and attempt to charge the railgun, it'll simply bring you out of binoculars. However, if you start charging the railgun, and THEN go into your binoculars, you can use the crosshairs on the screen to aim the shot, and it actually works fairly well

2) A lot of people are complaining that the railguns fire time is inconsistent: YOU CAN CONTROL WHEN THE RAILGUN FIRES. The railgun has a one second charge up time, simply let go of the trigger and the railgun will fire. This means that you can fire the railgun in around a second, leaving people no time to evade or kill you. Simply watch the capacitor display on the gun or on you HUD, and as soon as they reach the top, the railgun is ready to fire. 

3) This really only applies to Spartan ops

The Chief is noted by Cortana to be lucky. That's why he stood out. Lasky, the appearance of the chief was lucky in FUD, but he's lost his brother, his best friend cum romantic interest, he doesn't really know his mother and God knows what happened to his father.

Unlike the Chief

Finally, though born to civilians, was built for war. Lasky, though born to a soldier, was not. His allergy to cytoprethaline was so unique, so *unlikely* (another sign of his lack of luck) and so damaging that he shouldn't be a soldier, but he's still a soldier. Just like Chief.

Here are some FAQS from the original creator of the event 
*NazzerDawk*


**Q) One last time? Does this mean Halo 3 is being taken down?**


A) No, then we can keep doing this on the first weekend of every month, but I'd rather just have everyone on at once*

**Q) Halo 3 is dead

*A) I've already gauged the interest and managed to get tons of people interested specifically because this is a one-time event. Previous attempts to repopulate the servers failed because they were long-term repopulation attempts

**Q) How do I get involved?**

*A) Just get on Halo 3 matchmaking on Febuary 1st, no fee, no pledge, no need to message me, and if you miss the first day, get on the second or the third! That's all there is to it: Just play*.

**Q) Why can't we keep playing? Why just these three days?**

*A) The event is just these three days

1352669261.0,130z8c,Master Chief's Face And You.,Zyner,507,118,180,"There's a lot of controversy going around as to whether 343i did the right thing showing Master Chief's face/eyes and the correct answer is: Yes.

Why? Well first of all, and bits and pieces. You need to realize that this trilogy is tackling a different subject than the previous and shouldn't be trying to put the two together. Yes, both trilogies are titled ""Halo"" but only the first trilogy is actually about the Halos, the second is about the Forerunners and it just brings the Halo title back because anything else would just seem a bit off.

Why should you be okay with *now* seeing his face? Because it is a critical part of the theme, react, or interact with ordinary people as portrayed by Cortana in the game; You see Master Chief just shrug or barely even move to every statement Cortana says, were he a normal person he'd smile, laugh, and so on.

It's not until the moment John witnesses Cortana leave him that he realizes he actually feels something. From that point till he stands alone on the deck of Infinity he is thinking about it because he really doesn't know how to behave

The moment Lasky tells him ""You say that like soldiers and humanity are two different things, it's because he promised and made it his duty to protect her. He only realized he actually needed and maybe even wanted her only at this point. He never reacted socially with Cortana because he was just following orders to keep her safe, which is why he kept persisting on saying that she'll be okay and he'll find a way to fix her.

It's without a doubt that Halo 5 will tackle the transition of Master Chief from being a broken anti-social soldier to anything that's close to a human being, enjoy, and so on. This trilogy sets out to dwell deeper into what is Master Chief John-117 and his relationship with Cortana. It's highly speculated that Cortana might comeback due to her being taken by the Librarian, she may have cataloged some of her data but as of right now she is *dead* and John knows this.

So

**TL;DR?** - It's for the better being of Chief to go down this path.",self,t5_2qixk,1352693702.0,campaign,CSR-50,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/halo/comments/130z8c/master_chiefs_face_and_you/

I was only about 10 years old at the time and my parents wouldn't let me play violent video games so my big brother would take me over to his friend's house to play split screen halo in their basement. We would be yelling at each other where the flag was dropped or where the other team was at. communication was key to winning. 


A few years passed and I made my own friends friends who had an Xbox (me and my brother had a PS2 that we hated at the time and lusted over our friend's Xboxs haha!)


by the time halo 3 came out i had my own 360 and my parents finally saw though that halo would not turn me into a mass murderer. anyways


Reach was plagued by the same eerie silence. 


Halo 4


For example, it was just my brother and i talking to each other on the time while everyone else had their mics unplugged.

**I'VE UPDATED THIS LIST**
Last update on 11/30/2012

Lets start with the Multiplayer problems.

* Ragnarok and Haven - Don't get me wrong at all, but isn't nearly as bad. (Weighting on these has been patched)  
* Flood - Used to love Infection in Halo Reach, and evade was what ruined Infection in Reach, and this is no different. Ordinance would also be cool too, but it isn't 100% necessary. Consider more than 1 gametype as well. Remember Halo 3? That was good times.    
* Ammo - I know the game can't handle having so many renders on the map because graphics are absolutely everything, I hate picking up Sniper and knowing I'm stuck with it unless I go bombing into the firefight on the map. Edit: 343 has slightly patched weapon despawn times, and having the ammo perk works wonders.  
* Lack of Maps - This kind of ties in with the reason that Ragnarok and Haven are being chosen
* Little X - Everyone's complaining about this
* Warthog Turret - All I'm saying is that it needs a bit of a boost. Not much
* More Ordinance - This could be a workaround to the lack of ammo thing. Have more ordinance spawn randomly in random spots on the map, DMR, Magnum, etc)  
* More Focus on Objective - This only needs to be toned a bit, derping around and making me lose.   
* Betrayals - I haven't experienced being betrayed for Sniper or Mech, because they technically weren't betrayed. We need to remove Sniper horny fags with a ban or workaround of some sort.  
* The Wall Glitches - Pretty straightforward on this one. Campfags find an exploit. Give 'em a killzone or an invisible wall to stop them from winning Oddball games ridiculously easily. Edit: All of the known glitches have been patched by 343.
* Split-Screen Lag - There's been a lot of framerate drop from splitscreen apparently. Needs to be fixed ASAP.  
* Playlists - I know 343 is planning on working on this, FFA (Rumble Pit), Regular and Big Team Objective Gametypes, Action Sack, Grifball (Already confirmed) and more variants of Slayer, like Team BRs, Team DMRs, etc.   Edit: Team Snipers and FFA have returned.
* Free-For-All W/L Ratio - Give a win to the top 3 or 4 players rather than the top 1. People care about their W/L and that's not helping much.    
* XP Cap - I believe 343 is going to raise the cap after a few weeks. The cap was so that if boosting exploits were found
* Kill Cams [Added] - There is no way I got killed by some guy shooting at the ground
* Sword Lunge [Added] - They *said* that they were gimping the sword
* Vehicles [Added] - There are some people complaining about the amount of vehicles in BTB. I can agree that on some maps
* Gauss Hog [Added] - Unless you have more than willing teammates, but don't spawn it instantly)
* Moving While Score Checking [Added] - I say it was useful as hell in Reach
* Voting [Added] - Add a ""None of the above"" option.
* After Game XP Screen [Added] - Show all Commendation and Challenge XP.

Custom Games -   
* More customization and compatibility - I believe 343 is working on this

Forge -   
* A ""Forge World"" Map - People have been asking this non-stop. They need a forge world map
* Small Issues - Bringing back stuff like precision controls and zoom, and magnets.     

If there is anything to add, I'll put it in.

First I just want to start off that I'm not upset with all of you.  The vast majority of you have been doing a spectacular job following the rules &amp; providing great content to this subreddit.  You are the reason why I have grown to love this subreddit for the past couple of years

With that said, excessive downvoting, hatred, and total disrespect to other users opinions these vocal users have been exhibiting have gone on for far too long and it's about time something is done about it.

Effective immediately there will be some new policies and rules in r/halo to ensure that this subreddit can continue to be a sanctuary for Halo players of all kinds.

---

####New Policies

1: Any disrespect towards another user will result in a permaban from this subreddit. Disagreeing with other opinions is ok but that doesn't give you the right to downvote and harass them. (I've been issuing temporary bans to rampant users

2:  Don't push your opinions onto others and state them as facts. (There have been too many users starting arguments with others here that truly believe that they know exactly what needs to be done to 'save' Halo.

 * For example:  Don't tell others to basically f*** off if they say anything positive about Halo 4.  (You'd be surprised how often I have to remove these comments)

3: Please be kind to our newer users.  People are still getting into this wonderful series, stop being a fag will be removed, and they will receive a temporary ban from this subreddit.

4:  Off topic comments will be removed immediately

* Reason:  The silent users and respected members of this community have informed me that they're growing tired on how often some of you turn a good discussion into something flammatory.  Just this morning some innocent user received dozens of insults towards his family just because some of you had an issue with one of his comments.  

5:  Don't downvote based on your personal opinion.  Please judge the content based on the quality of their submission instead of using it as a I don't like this button.  The downvote arrow's original intent is to make unnecessary comments less known to the public

Please feel free to [private message me](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=OpTic_Niko) if you have any questions about these new policies.  We're doing our best to help make sure this subreddit can be as best as it can be

---

####I have one last thing to say

Please be free to use that report button to report any disrespectful comments that you may stumble across. I'm always here to get rid of said content, and consider it a public service to report anything that I may have missed.

Thank you for taking time out of your day to read this.

I think people need to realize that the game is 4 days old and that changes will be made. I made a list of the things I thought were great about H4. Mind you

* Infinity Slayer - In the older Halos
Infinity Slayer impressed me in H4 with the ordinance drops and such
* Loadouts - Everyone is crying over how they ""stole this from CoD"". CoD stole a LOT more from Halo and still made a (in my opinion) terrible game. I like being able to choose which weapon I use and I hated being forced to use the god awful assault rifle while playing reach. I like choice. 
* Ordinance Drops - Simple on this one. Hated people sitting on Sniper or Shotgun, rather than bombing into battle to snag some off a teammate, usually getting me killed.
* Maps - SOOO many complaints about the maps. Ok, like I keep saying, it's 4 days old, calm down! Personally, I really like the maps, and thought they were VERY well made.
* Lack of playlists - Like I said, and like all of them. Do something different, try something **other** than flood, you'll like it, I swear!
* Objective - In Halo Reach, even I have a better time grabbing some hill time, or covering my teammate's ass while he runs a flag in.
* OP weapons - Get used to it! Everything in this game has a counter to it, you have to earn it. Sick of getting out DMR'd? Learn which weapons are better than it, or use a DMR yourself. I have 0 problem killing DMR users now. 
* Innovation - It's no wonder people love CoD so much. 343 goes and makes a brand new game with brand new weapons, and it gets pounded on for it. CoD releases the same game with new maps and a couple new weapons and the 12 year olds go apeshit. 
* Join Session - Can't tell you how many times I played Reach where my teammates left me to a 1v4. I understand that joining a game where you're getting raped is a lost cause

Anyways, not repeat what already is. If you miss ""how Halo 3 was"" go play Halo 3. We're not stopping you. There is not a lot of things wrong with Halo 4, and I hope 343 keeps taking necessary steps to remove any problems.
Any of the stupid things, stop being so spoiled and learn to figure out how to work around it yourself. 

Edit: Nearly forgot. I praise 343 dearly for armor abilities. Nothing is OP. No more armor lock. I used to HATE Hologram and Active camo because it was useless. Hologram is #1 spot on Halo 4 for me, Jetpack was overused, and way too overpowered and is definitely easier to win against in Halo 4.",,False,self,t5_2qixk,,http://www.reddit.com/r/halo/comments/12zgy8/on_a_positive_note/

An update on two things that fans have been complaining about since day 1

And finally a promising update (one which I am personally very excited about) on the future of Spartan Ops. See: the section of the quote that is in bold. One of the criticisms of both the Halo 4 campaign and Spartan Ops is that there wasn't much variety in the objectives. Words like ""Button Pushing Simulator 4"" were thrown around. The part in bold seems to be directly addressing that. This means that the gameplay will have more variety and might not get as boring as quickly

Part One - The Forerunners (Circa ~100
Hundreds of thousands of years ago, as well as The Mantle; something of a philosophy, a religion, that forebade killing and whatnot. Amongst their creations were the Flood, Forerunners, and Humans. The Precursors would exterminate all species determined to be unworthy of the Mantle, and would determine their worthiness using the Flood as a test. The Forerunners then went to war with the Precursors, and then claimed to be the inheritors of the Mantle

Many years later, but the Humans managed to defeat the menace by giving a third of their population a genetic strain that would kill the Flood - a poison. (It is later revealed that the Flood can choose to infect and not to infect, and decided the humans were not ready for the test). They nearly defeated the Flood, at the cost of several of their worlds and billions of their people. Ravaged, they needed resources, and started to fight the Forerunners for land.

This was the start of the Human-Forerunner war. The Forerunners won, split into several species, removed from their technology, and exiled on Earth as punishment, and would not share the secrets of how they ""defeated"" the Flood. (It is revealed that the humans would be tested again once they rose from the exile). The Forerunners resorted to desperate measures.

The Didact (who lead the war against the humans) and the Master Builder (the lord-king-god of the Forerunners) created 05-032 Medicant Bias, was convinced to betray it's masters.) While the interrogation happened, the Didact was vehemently opposing the Master Builder's plan - a Halo Array, which killed all life in a huge, huge range (life is food for the Flood) so that the Flood may not continue spreading. He opposed this plan since it violated the Mantle, and instead proposed that they create a series of Shield Worlds - to research and find a solution to the Flood. The Didact was then exiled.

The Forerunners decide to protect themselves by hiding within a shield world when the Halos are fired, and they never made it in. The Flood was preserved within these shield worlds, as well as on the Halos, kept in quarantine to be studied by the Monitors of the Halos. 

The Halo project continued, the Librarian, was catalouging every single species DNA in the Library Project so that they may live on after the Halo fires. The Didact eventually transfers his memories to Bornstellar, and lived on through him after being killed by the Master Builder. The Librarian landed on Earth, buried a portal to one of the Arks (shield worlds that create Halos). The Didact left to Reqiuem - another shield world - before the firing of the Halo rings, and was presumably put into a Cryptum once more. Then the Halo rings fired, killing all life. The Halo rings were left there, which lets them operate forerunner tech via intuition.)

Dreadnoughts (Forerunner ships) were sent to reseed life across the galaxy.


Part Two - The Covenant (Circa ~1000 BC

All species - save for the Forerunners - have been reseeded, and, having the massive technological advantages of the Forerunners to their disposal to research and alter, they won the civil war, but with only a thousand or so of their species left. About a thousand years later, in 981 BC, they discovered Sangheilos

The Sangheili also felt the Forerunner artifacts to be sacred. But, and defeated the Sangheili. The survivors came into an agreement, a peace treaty with the San'Shyuum, called The Covenant. They still revere and worship the Forerunners, even though their alter and adapt their technology. They induct into their Covenant the Huragok (Engineers) - bio-mechanical floating ""robots"" who's sole purpose is to fix-up technology. They go around, discovering Forerunner worlds, and taking their technology for their own. They also discover new species, and eventually have a huge force within their covenant. There is still tension between them - the Sangheili and the San'Shyuum treat the rest of the species with little respect

The Covenant has one goal - to go on the Great Journey - their misinterpretation of the firing of the Halo Array. They actively seek out the Halo rings.

Parts 3 and Parts 4 in comments - removed because of character limit.







**TL;DR (sup dawg):**

The Precursors made all life, but the Forerunners found out and killed them first. Then the Flood, which was created by the Precursors as a final test for the humans and the Forerunners, was unleashed. The humans fought them off, but at a great price, so the humans started war with the Forerunners so they could get more land and resources. The Forerunners fought back, brought the humans to the stone age, since the humans would not tell them how they defeated the Flood, the Librarian

A Covenant was formed between aliens

The Humans, and created many colonies, under one unified government. Some people, the Insurrectionists, didn't like this, and rebelled violently. The Spartan program began in response, and they just so happened to be ready to fight back when the Covenant made first contact.

They discovered the Halos, alone, cyro-frozen in the Forward Unto Dawn. The humans start to attempt a civil war with the elites. One a forerunner world, a bunch of Forerunner tech is discovered and put onboard the largest UNSC ship, the Infinity. The Infinity trains the new Spartans, the Covenant is dead, everything is awesome.

And then Master Chief stumbles upon Reqiuem.





CHANGELIST:

* Updated some info on the nature of the Flood. From these two comments:

ThatAwesomePenguin:
Just a little thing, and was 'defeated'.

Vectorsxx:
The Flood were created in revenge of the Forerunners destroying the Precursors.
Humanity was in the fray of the Flood and almost wiped it out. But at the same pace
The Forerunners would continue to fight the flood and eventually lose

* Fixed the incorrect reference to the maginot line being shield worlds

TURBO117:
Can I actually touch up a little on just one part. You said in one part that the Covenant discovered directions to one of the rings on Reach. Now, dear lord thank you:] I'm going to have my girlfriend read this before Halo 4 comes out because she doesn't have time to read all the books &amp; play all the games and I refuse to let her enjoy Halo 4 when she truly would have no idea what she was enjoying.

tgarnett:
Well you're both right sort of. But Turbo was correcting you on the Covenant finding directions to Halo on Reach. Cortana used the information on the relic on Sigma Octanus IV
Another unrelated part that bugged me

* Fixed a bit of chronology. From this comment:

exposito:
The Didact went into exile before Medicant Bias was turned.

* Fixed info regarding Kilo-Five. From this comment:

Let me preface this with letting you know I am not new to Halo. I've been playing religiously since Halo CE. I've been on Xbox live since Halo 2 dropped. I consider myself much better than average and have been on every Halo game.

So I popped in Halo 3 last night to join in this throwback weekend. The first thing that struck me was the graphics. I could not believe how much things have improved. The graphics, because it's all about game play. 

This is where you'll all hate me. The game was too slow. The movement was awkward and clunky. And I SUCKED. Bad. My BR battles were horrible. I admit this probably contributes to my opinion

I think all the extras in Halo 4 (jetpack, which I think requires more skill for countering. 

With all the talk here on how great Halo 3 was compared to 4, what is your opinion now that you've played Halo 3 again?

First of all you have the discovery of the first living Forerunner

Second

I realise that a lot of this is covered in books and other material so a lot of us came to Halo 4 with some idea of what's going on. But for fans coming from Halo 3 to 4 it's quite a jump. Even if all of the people on Infinity knew about this stuff

Which leads me to another problem I have: no one explains the Mantle once in game

1 - Quick on the trigger 

You might be wondering what ""combat skill medals are"". They are as follows 

* **Killjoy** - End an opponent's killing spree.

* **Headcase** - Kill a sprinting opponent with a headshot. 

* **From The Grave** - Kill an opponent after you die. 

* **Reload This** - Kill an opponent who is reloading. 

* **Showstopper** - Stop an assassination by killing the assassinating opponent. 

2 - Take on the hill

Go play KOTH. You can easily complete the first challenge whilst playing KOTH so that is the strategy that I am going to use.
