The best instance was hands-down the invisible dragon fight:

In the main quest of the game, I cannot see him. When I start seeing the fire come out of thin air, I realize. *The dragon isn't going to render, so I will have to fight an invisible fucking dragon.* This added some fun difficulty to the fight.

Thought I would share my favorites (mostly strategy/RPG)",Ranger33,81,9,http://www.reddit.com/r/lowendgaming/comments/1a1u8j/due_to_school_ive_been_stuck_gaming_on_my_laptop/, I'm gaming on a Lenovo z570 which is a solid little laptop but nothing to write home about.  Over the last couple semesters I've discovered plenty of games that are amazing and require little to no graphics.  Honestly, and since developers aren't worried about throwing money/time at graphics

Aaanyway
Conquest of Elysium - It's like HOMM as a roguelike. Very addictive with tons of replayability.  There is also it's bigger, which I have not played but have heard lots of good things about and will probably get at some point.

Xenonauts (still in beta) - XCOM remake much closer to the original than the new XCOM.  Has wonderful 2D graphics and once finished could offer the ultimate XCOM experience.

Avadon The Black Fortress and Avernum Escape From the Pit:  These two are from the same developer and if you like one you will like the other.  Simple sounds and graphics, but these are the most recent ones.

Distant Worlds: The ultimate space 4x IMO. This is one of the few games I have ever played where the universe actually felt like a living, then thousands of civilian, military, and commercial ships make their way through space, each with their own name, mission, cargo

ToME - A free roguelike with nice simple graphics and a better UI than most.  As you play you unlock new races and classes

Panzer Corps - Kind of like Advance Wars, and then there are a series of DLC that make for a super long grand campaign. Really fun and easy to get into.

Finally, realistic wargames and strategy titles that don't require much computer horsepower. The prices can be a bit higher than other places, but they put out quality products.  Every game has a launcher that links to forums, manuals, automatic updates, etc. and the DRM is a simple serial code at installation.

The first time I played it I was disappointed due to the framerate of around 15-20 fps on the lowest settings and so I tried a lot of things to get the framerate up. The game wasn't unplayable at 15-20fps

So I did some research and looked for some mods and now my framerate floats around 50 fps and the game is much more enjoyable as a result. I put together a video to show the mods I've used

If you would prefer to see these mods in text form

The game won't look graphically spectacular with these settings and mods installed, and I recommend only trying this if the system has a dedicated graphics card and if Skyrim is on sale.

1. Cost of the hardware. You don't need to upgrade every year just play the latest and greatest game. You can also buy cheaper computers to start with.

2. Cost of the games. Games get reduced in price significantly following release

3. Mods. The modding community for your 5 year old game is already mature

4. Documentation. In a similar way to point 3, strategy guides and other information on a game have already been extensively bashed out. If you encounter a bug, just do a quick google. If you need help on a puzzle, just glance at a walkthrough someone wrote 3 years ago.

5. You know which games are good. You will never waste money on a game which just came out

6. Patches. Your 5 year old game is already on patch v1.04 and all the bugs have been nicely ironed out. In some cases the gameplay has been considerably improved over the original

MY SPECS (Almost everything on this list is based off of them

Video Card - Geforce 8200 M G (this is usually capped/bottle necked by my CPU so I'd say it doesn't really matter)
CPU - Single Core 2.1 Ghz
RAM - 2.8 GB (most of the time most games don't even need this much RAM so you should be fine)


Hotline Miami

Halo 1

Halo Custom Edition

Minecraft (running optifine and on multiplayer it works pretty well)

Cave story

Limbo (How well this game runs is mostly dependent on your video card

Killing Floor

Jet Set Radio HD

Planetscape

Dwarf Fortress (with a cap on it)

Doom 1

Most Source games (Except for black mesa source

Team Fortress 2 is no longer considered low-end due to the insane amount of lag that happens in in-game fire fights for people with the minimum requirements. (Updates

Tribal Trouble

Rome Total War

League of Legends (haven't really played this much myself but tons of people say it is low end and the tutorial runs nicely)

Fable - The Lost Chapters (Set to all low you're pretty much set)

Warhammer 40

Bastion

Civilization 4

F.E.A.R

The walking dead games can run on ass

Vampires- The Masquerade (lags at certain points

StarWars Battlefront 2 runs ""ok"" except for the fact it can get pretty laggy but if that happens just restart the mission.

Max Payne 1 &amp; 2

San Andreas has some lag but if you set it to all low it runs like a dream
N+

Every Single YS game

Audiosurf

All of the splintercell games from the last generation

Most of the Hitman games

FarCry

Nintendo DS emulators (depends on the game but it usually runs fine

Prey (it runs ok

Mount and Blade Warband (has a dx7 mode and runs fine unless in a major battle with my specs

Mafia

Morrowind

Torchlight I and II

Arx Fatalis

Commandos I and II

teleglitch

Eversion

Spelunky

I Wanna Be the Guy
Barkley Shut Up And Jam Gaiden 

Meat Boy

DOOM 3 (it's an ok game but it runs pretty nice if you have the CPU for it)
Space Funeral

Terraria 

Recettear

Of course if you can't run most of these games than the wiki has great some great games.


I reccomend you find a year with games your computer can run pretty good and stick to it and don't go above it.
2005 is an optimal place due to the fact that games were starting to get good graphics but the games usually had requirements from 2004.
If you want proof of this play DOOM 3

RESOURCES TO FIND GAMES

how to find your PC year 
http://www.game-debate.com/games/index.php?year=2005
Find a point in time where your rigs weakness was still acceptable and run with it. Once you find a year where your rigs weakness is ok everything in
and below that year is fair game

I don't really reccomend can you run it
can you run it is probably not detecting your CPU and is auto-saying that you can't run the game.
This could be the same for video cards I do not know.

2. I stuck with 1866 DDR3 memory

3. Feel free to swap out the A10-6800k for the A10-5800k to save 10-20 bucks. The 5800k is the last generation chip and the graphics performance between the two are pretty much identical.

I usually get 30-40 FPS and with this I get over 100. It should make the game more playable for older computers.

For those of you don't know
)

A lot of people have been asking how to get better performance. This Tribes.ini setup sets your graphics to be SIGNIFICANTLY lower than minimal settings. This is explicitly for people struggling with 20 - 30 fps when using minimal settings

**Notes**

**How to use:**

Find your Tribes.ini file and make a copy of it. Place it on your desktop and DO NOT touch it! This will be your backup. Then, so keep it fairly low.** Enter a game! If the graphics are too low for your liking, simply delete your edited Tribes.ini file and drag the Tribes.ini file on your desktop into your config file! All settings will be back to your previous setup. 

**DynamicLights** Can be set to False (Default is True) to gain 5 to 10 FPS, also making it very difficult to see enemies at reasonably far distances.

**UseMinimalNVIDIADriverShaderOptimization** Can be set to True (Default is False) if you are using older NVIDIA cards (6 to 8 series). Will improve performance slightly for these older cards.

* Know your aspect ratio (eg: 4:3 or 16:9) and wind your resolution down to the next smallest one for your ratio... It may look a bit funky but it is a **big** fps booster.

* Close **all** background programs. It may seem obvious

* If online **don't** host. This can really grind your fps to a halt

I humbly disagree.

Without further ado, fun multiplayer FPS games that are in many cases cross-compatible with Mac and Windows.

* Quake Live: A F2P browser-based rendition of Quake 3 Arena. It has a burgeoning community for a game so old

* Warsow: Another free arena shooter. In spite of sharing the same genre as QL, but it exists nonetheless. Also note that Warsow is 100% free whereas QL has a freemium model.

* Xonotic: Another arena shooter. This is an open source continuation of Nexuiz, and in my opinion, a bit easier to pick up than QL or Warsow.

* Assault Cube: One of my (for some reason) all-time favorite low-end multiplayer FPS games. It plays like a very fast-paced version of Counter-Strike (for want of a better, in my opinion, infinitely better than it already is. Has a surprisingly large community for such an old game. A surprising amount of skill is needed to succeed as well. Highly recommended.

* Doom/Doom 2: What more needs to be said. Incredible classic FPS games from way back in the day. If you don't mind the dated graphics these are well worth a look

* Fortress Forever: A total conversion Source mod heavily inspired by Team Fortress Classic. I have put more hours into this game than almost any other. Extremely dynamic and fast-paced

* CS: Source: Not much needs to be said. One of the most popular shooters ever released on the PC, but it is definitely a lot of fun.

* Day of Defeat Source: A very fun

* Team Fortress 2: The second most-played game on Steam for a reason. TF2 is one of the best F2P games ever created. There are nine classes to choose from in many team-based game modes, note that if you have a very low end system that you should be prepared to configure TF2's settings to obscenely low levels to run adequately.

* Unreal Tournament '99: Definitely worth checking out if you remember Unreal Tournament from back in the day

* Wolfenstein Enemy Territory: I confess that I have never played this

* Call of Duty 2/4: These will run on what most would consider low-end these days. The competitive scenes have died for both

* Half-Life 2 Deathmatch: Classic deathmatch and team deatmatch in the Source engine

* Battlefield 1942: Now 100% free from EA's Origin client, and the gameplay has aged quite nicely. Highly recommended.

MY SPECS:

2.1 Ghz Single Core CPU
2.8 Gigs of RAM
NVIDIA 8200M G integrated Graphics Card

All of these download links have been checked and i've installed them myself!

First off

http://newvegas.nexusmods.com/mods/34778

Once you install that install this .esm!

http://newvegas.nexusmods.com/mods/40128

(Copy &amp; paste it into your Data folder in your new vegas directory and run new vegas and go to data files and click better performance.esm

Download GameBooster and Boost your game! This temporarily closes out all background processes and adds a couple FPS to your game

!!!IMPORTANT!!!
Unless you want the games audio to lag behind the game itself hit Ctrl + Alt + Delete while in game and this will minimize your game and bring up task manager

Now onto the resolution
You should have a resolution of 800x600 and you should be able to run it in full screen as opposed to window mode.

While fallout new vegas's Vsync is checked
To disable vsync and get more FPS you'll want to do the following!

Taken from ""http://www.geforce.com/optimize/guides/new-vegas-tweak-guide#5""

You can force VSync off in Fallout: New Vegas by editing a command variable found in the Fallout_default.ini file in the \Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\fallout new vegas directory. Make a backup copy of this file first

- drivers usually stretch the game from 4:3 to 16:10 which makes it look like ass and hinders feel of the mouse


- terrain view is limited



Blizzard could have gone with minimal vertical pixel requirement of 600 when designing the game and us players with shitty computers would be delighted with resolutions like 1024x640 (16:10) or 1024x600 (16:9) which would grant us smooth framerates, but it's stretched and missing terrain view.



Welcome to the franken resolution from Macs - 1152x720 - which gives me full screen image with perfect proportions (being 16:10)



1024x768 - 0

1152x720 - 0, perfect proportions, wide visible terrain)

1280x720 - 0, widest visible terrain)

1280x800 - 1, wide visible terrain)



In my system 1152x720 is not available from the start - just add it through your GPU control panel



TL;DR - if you have shitty computer that barely handles SC2 in it's lowest resolution and has 16:10 screen (like 90% of older laptops) - switch from 1024x768 to 1152x720 - SC2 will have perfect image proportions,False,self,t5_2u51f,False,,,t3_vbrm9

Emultors for the Nintendo64 and Playstation on my laptop require more attention. This is where you need to understand ""plugins"".
The Emulators I use for the N64 are ""Mupen64"" and ""Project64""

So heres an essentials list of plugins I think anyone with a ""low-end"" computer should obtain.

*Mupen64/Project64:*

Video - ""Jabo's Direct3D8 1.6"" / ""Jabo's Direct3D6 1.5.2"" / ""direct64 v0.5.03.25""

Sound - ""Jabo's DirectSound 1.6"" / ""zilmars audio plugin""

Input - ""Jabo's Direct Input7 1.6"" / ""N-Rage's Direct-input8 V2""

*ePSXe:*

Video - ""Pete's D3D Driver 1.77"" / ""Pete's DX6 D3D Driver 1.77"" - (there are opengl drivers - but they were slower for me)

Sound - ""Eternal SPU Plugin Lite 1.41"" / ""Pete's DSound Audio Driver 1.15

Cdrom - ""P.E.Op.S. CDR Driver 1.4"" - and ePSXe's

Fallout 1, and Fallout new vegas at Low-Medium settings.

performance",2,4,http://www.reddit.com/r/lowendgaming/comments/udtl7/increasing_hp_dot_s_e3gma_3150atom_n570/,"Hello. My original ""gaming"" laptop (yes, I know that's a joke in itself, shush) is currently being fixed on warranty, literally the cheapest reasonable one I could find (costed me 280$).

I can't help being a gamer, and I could certainly use some help.

&amp;nbsp;

The specs are: Atom N570 dual core 1.66GHz

&amp;nbsp;

First off

1) I'm using [Sherry 1.3](http://9xxssf.info/topic/360-sherry-13-for-gma-3150-is-here/) drivers for GMA3150. They have shown some noticeable performance improvements (for instance

2) I'm using the [GBoost](http://www.gzero.com/gboost/home.html) application. 

3) I'm using [ReadyBoost](http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/products/features/readyboost). Not a huge improvement for gaming

4) I defrag my harddrive regularly and uninstall crap programs I no longer use. I use [CCleaner](http://www.piriform.com/CCLEANER).

5) I'm keeping windows up to date.

6) I set the process priority in task manager to higher on games.

7) Disabled power saving

&amp;nbsp;

Now

1) Getting an external SSD for gaming/pagefile. This one requires money I do not really have

2) Changing operating system. Tiny XP or Linux seem like good choices - however, which is redundant given the GBoost utility. 

3) Overclocking existing components:

(**WARNING**: Do not try to overclock if you do not know what you're doing. Read extensively first

* Allocating more memory to the integrated card. Sherry 1.3 already seems to allocate 256MB rather than the default (which I believe is 64) - and from what I've read, the bios on this netbook has absolutely no options for this.

* Increasing the clock speed of the integrated card. This should theoretically be possible - GMA3150 is clocked at 200 Mhz, are there any other solutions?

* Overclocking the CPU. This seems like the most likely to work. Someone has already done this with this processor up to 2, I can't seem to find a clock generator file for my motherboard (sje06_pt) for setfsb.

* Overclocking the memory. Theoretically this should be possible. I've not yet done extensive research on this. The general purpose tools from www.tweakers.fr do not support this hardware. The bios has no options for this

4) Some method of lowering graphical settings all across the board. The basic GMA driver utility has some settings for this, this is just something I came up with while brainstorming just now. [Edit] I found something for this. [3dAnalyzer](http://games.softpedia.com/get/Tools/3D-Analyze.shtml) seems to have this capability for many games. However, an ""across the board"" solution would still be useful.

&amp;nbsp;

Please, correct me. I'd rather not screw something up accidentally. If you can think of any other ways to improve performance that I've not mentioned (even if they seem obvious, I tried to be fairly comprehensive), please point them out.

&amp;nbsp;

Thanks in advance for any help. I also hope that what I've listed will be helpful to 
some of you.

What follows for me is an almost ritualistic hacking-away of the graphics settings. The only thing that really matters is the frame rate

Resolution is first to go, but I imagine a younger person might find it intolerable. If I can see what I'm doing, and the framerate is high, I'm good to go. The only game I struggled with was the new Deus Ex, some of the HUD graphics are too small to read at that resolution!

Maybe it's because PC hardware is so powerful, dropping the resolution a bit might be worth considering.

It's sad that most games don't offer a 675p option as the next step down from 720p. Is it because some monitors can't recognize the resolution?

There are a couple other 16:9 resolutions worth considering if your system is pretty strapped for performance, jaggy mess. These are 1024x576 and 960x540 (also known as QHD, or quarter HD).

Let's start!

**The Total War Series**

The Total War series has had a great run and is still going strong. It's a favorite for history fanatics and those who are obsessed with war. The game focuses on taking control of a country at a certain time in history. From a feudal Europe, many places and events to participate in. From the british isles as William Wallace fights of norweigen invaders and the English fight back the Welsh and Irish rebels, to Rome, where one of the three houses of Rome fights for their own survival against the rest, to Empire. Total War has been grand, great and easily playable. Maybe not the latest games, but the golden, games like these:

**Rome:Total War** The guys at /r/Totalwar will tell you plain and simple, a lot of people will flock to the series once more. But if you want to live in the golden era of Total War? Grab Rome! 
[It's $9.99 on Steam right now](http://store.steampowered.com/app/4760/) though it has the tendency to go on sale and may, the battle proportions can get huge, you can have up to five thousand men on one battlefield, which can cause you quite a bit of choppyness, but that's only for huge battles. Adjusting the graphical settings can give you unbelievably smooth gameplay, and you will feel so empowered when you have four hundred archers rain fiery roman fury upon the Gallic barbarians. Afterwards hearing 'This land is Roman!' I highly recommend it. 

**Medieval II: Total War Gold** Medieval II is a improved second reboot of Medieval: Total War. It's an extremely fun game, DESTROY your enemies capital with cannons and mortars and firearm-wielding units, or march on a country of your choosing with an army of mounted knights, you decide how you dominate. The time frame is based from the late 1000's all the way to the 1500's. From William the Conqueror to Ghengis Khan, you have a lot of realistic historical figures to fight with and against. The game also has an active modding community.  

Medieval II Total War Gold

Kingdoms, New Spain, Apachean tribes, Chichlimeca, Tlaxcalans and Tasascans, the map stretches from Guyana to Texas. 

Britannia, Wales, Scotland, Ireland and Norway. All on the map of the british isles. 

Crusades, Egypt, Turks or Byzantium. The map covers Egypt, the Levant and Anatolia. 

Tuetonic gives you four new playable factions, Denmark, Novgord  and you can unlock Poland the Holy Roman Empire, the map stretches from Germany to Russia. Great fun and greatly worth it.

Now

Furthermore

**Classic Ace of Spades(Or 'Buildandshoot')** Disregard Ace of Spades in the steam store. 'Build and shoot' is Ace of Spades in it's classic form

**The Ship(And it's multiplayer!)** The Ship is an older source engine game where you are trapped on a ship in the middle of the atlantic and are given a target to kill on the ship, all of which are scattered around the ship. The Ship is [$19.99 in the steam store](http://store.steampowered.com/app/2400) right now.
The Ship Single player is [$9.99 in the Steam store.](http://store.steampowered.com/app/2420/)

**McPixel** Is just a load of WTF for five bucks. It's plenty worthy

**Towns** is also a very fun game

It came down to a few things, and while I don't feel it was necessarily worth as much as I spent, it was worth the fun I spent on the game.

Anyway, or they finally started listening to the community, and introduced the long awaited meta game.

I mainly just play TF2, I have almost no processes running, I even close down explorer.exe, I get my total memory usage down to about 300 or 400 MB, so I doubt it has anything to do with my computer trying to free up RAM for the game.

I have a Macbook from 2009 or so, and a Nvideo GeForce 9400M Graphics card (256 MB vram).

The first and probably largest group of low-end gamers are those on sub 500$ laptops/computers that are prebuilts. Their specs usually look something like:

Decent Core 2 Duo - Lowest End i3
1-4gb ram
Intel HD graphics or similar

The second group I think is made up of people with computers that were decent at the time

[Europa Universalis 3, so you can get some pretty funny alternate histories.  This is my personal favourite, and probably one of the more accessible Paradox games.  **You might need a forum account to view the mod.**

[Victoria: Complete](http://www.paradoxplaza.com/games/victoria-complete) ([Steam](http://store.steampowered.com/app/42980/)).  In this game, vote of reforms, manage trading, and overall much more dynamic than running one on Eu3 (for example: making USA a communistic government).  However, it is much more difficult, too.  Histroy-wise, it's much more likely to not get so off track.  Some people prefer this than Victoria 2.

[Hearts of Iron 2](http://www.paradoxplaza.com/games/hearts-of-iron-ii) ([Steam](http://store.steampowered.com/app/22130/)).  This game is all about running any country during World War 2.  You manage the flow of resources, fine tune units, all that fun stuff.  It is rather Historically accurate, and is really good for ""What if"" scenarios.  Also, you can check out [Arsenal of Democracy](http://store.steampowered.com/app/42850/) and [Darkest Hour](http://store.steampowered.com/app/73170/).  They were both made by other people, yet published by Paradox.  Both are based off of HoI, but they each have a few significant differences.  I own Aresenal of Democracy.  I've heard that a lot of people prefer playing these than HoI3.

That should get you started.  If your PC has at least 2Gb Ram, Hearts of Iron 3, or any other Paradox game.

Each player gets his own four man squad with which he gets to use tactically. In a game you can expect up to 10v10 (so 10 squads each side) in an Axis vs Allies format on various maps. The game is actually capable of 32v32.

The thing I love most about this game is the fact that as you rank up (from private all the way up to colonel) you actually get more say in how the battle pans out. Once you're a high enough rank you'll eventually be the commanding officer (CO) in your battles. Once you're the CO of your team you decide who goes where and what the battle plan is. This player interaction is what I love most about this game.

Ok

[Silent Hunter 3](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silent_Hunter_III) - My only complaint is that the light reflecting off the ocean is rendered in high detail and there are no options to lower it.  Lags like hell if you go on the bridge or use the external camera above water.  But not really a big deal because it can be played with just the periscope and the navigation and tactical maps.  Aside from that I love it.  Used to play the original all the time when I was a kid and this is simply a great game.  Never played number 2

Dawn of War- All of the first series run alright

[Hearts of Iron 3](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearts_of_iron_3) - The latest and most graphically demanding of the series

[Crusader Kings](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crusader_Kings_%28video_game%29) - Quite an old game

[Europa Universalis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europa_Universalis_III) - Based on a modified version of the Hearts of Iron 3 engine

[Mount and Blade](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_and_Blade:_Warband) - Yes, you play in a sandbox world where you can be a merchant and raise shitloads of cash, or you can take the bloody road and slaughter your way to the throne.  Five nations and an RPG leveling up system, dozens of castles and lords to siege and plot against. Full 3D but with great options to lower the quality, give it a try even if you don't think you'll be able to run it, you might be surprised!  

[SPAZ- Space Pirate and Zombies](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Pirates_and_Zombies) - Found out about this one on Reddit.  A nice top down space shooter with enough of a skeleton of a plot and enjoyable gameplay to get you to play it at least once.  Sadly, but it becomes playable with dozens of ships on the map.  If you can run it you'll play it for a while, it's quite fun.

[Starfarer](http://fractalsoftworks.com/) - In Beta currently

Mechcommander 1 and 2 run fine.  [Mechcommander Omnitech](http://www.hard-light.net/forums/index.php?board=210.0) is a free version of the game after the source was released.  However it tends to be pretty buggy

Mechwarrior series- MW4 is free but the site distributing it is currently full of dead links and the client to download doesn't even work.  I'm sure there's an .iso and crack laying around somewhere though...

[Blitzkrieg 1](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blitzkrieg_%28video_game%29) works for me
                                               
[Close Combat series](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Close_Combat_%28series%29) - The first Close Combat was released in '96 so I'm sure you'll have no problem running it.  I've played the first four since I was a kid and they never get old.  This is hardcore though, or vice-versa.  The units you start the map with are it.  No building new ones, no calling in reinforcements.  You win with well thought out tactics and playing your strengths and your enemies weaknesses.  Realistic weapon modelling and morale- kind of iffy in the first couple of games but by Battle of the Bulge it's quite polished.  Hmmm, I see they've come out with some remakes...

[The Operational Art of War 3](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Operational_Art_of_War) - Great counter-type good old fashioned wargame.  I remember going into the computer store when I was a kid and drooling over this game.  And all the other games.

Star Wars Battlefront 1 and 2.  Yeah.  Great mods too.

Dungeon Siege 1 and 2.

Games that DON'T work on my computer :(

Battlefield 2- WHY GOD WHY!?!? D:  Apparently lots of people have issues with this game.  From what I can tell

Company of Heroes- Now, as soon as I put my mouse to the edge of the screen and scroll ~5 fps max.  Then I stop scrolling and everything is fine.  Then I scroll and....

Crusader Kings 2- Simply wont initialize.

I used to play this game all the time when I had a crummy laptop. Now I have a pretty decent desktop that can run BF3 but I still go back and play this game every now and then.

It's an incredibly fun and addicting FPS with Death Match, Free For All, and a unique Ghost mode. There are a pretty decent number of maps to choose from and a ton of weapons.

I very highly recommend this game for anyone looking for a low end FPS. The only downfall is that there is a cash shop with some weapons that can only be bought with ZP (real money) but there are some ways to win free ZP.

Windows 7 Professional 64bit, Two optical DVD RW drives, Asus A8N-SLI Premium, has two PCIe slots for two graphic cards. 3 gigs of Ram, Nvidia Geforce GTX 260 graphics card, Creative Sound Blaster X-Fi Xtreme audio card.

The type of games that I want to play are games like Caesar 2, world in conflict, and maybe spore. I have no problem with putting all of the graphic settings as low as they can go and maybe not playing in full screen. Should I be able to play those games relatively well, without the fps dropping too low I mean? It has the two PCI express slots, and I was told in a previous post that I could buy a $60 graphics card and play modern games with better than console graphics, so that is definitely something I could do in the future if I need to.

Note: I wasn't trying to tie them into buying me a computer or giving me money to get one


My computer, take of lass than 50 megabytes of disk space.   It's got a pentium 4 processer, and an intel inside video/grahpics card i don't know the difference.

We were at my aunts and uncles house, yams with marshmallows,  mashed potatoes, my aunts amazing Swedish meatballs, green beans, etc.

first off, it's a printer.

Mine is a keyboard and mouse.

My mom is processing whats happening

Oh yeah, who has a mancave and an amazing gaming tower he custom built, says the monitor is better than his own.

My mom is handed the final

It has a terabyte of memory, and a quad core processor. 

It's the greatest. i also got a gift card, I was planning on getting a new headset, I'm hooked, best Christmas gift ever.


No.

No, on my way home, since my aunt and uncle live a special little place for older people to live peacefully, there's golf carts and stuff.

Some grandfather was drinking, he let go, and the kid crashed, and our bumper is now hanging off on one side.   Don't ask me how.

We borrowed a car from our aunt and uncle, if it's within 200 miles they tow it without troubles.   

Anyway

My uncle tells me ""It's just for school stuff.""

School?  A THOUSAND GIGABYTES OF MEMORY, AND SMALL MISCELLANEOUS SHIT.    A QUAD CORE PROCESSOR FOR SCHOOLWORK.

I got home, and how it was unfair. The best game I can play is minecraft, and i get 30 fps if my computer is feeling up to it, on tiny with optifine, animations off, particles off, off off off. low

I'm crying now. 


I can't fix it
 say what goes

She said when I got the steam client


I just.. I...

FUCKING..    I have so much pent up anger


I need a fucking hug.
