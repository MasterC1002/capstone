I don't have any decent before pictures, except for some natural thigh development. At my heaviest, competing in strongman, I got up to 290. I'm currently at 240 and holding steady.
You can see lots of videos of me lifting at http://www.youtube.com/user/Blenderate
This is what I looked like just prior to my last powerlifting competition

**Age?** 33

**Sex?** Male


**What sports or fitness activities are you involved in?**

I've competed in amateur strongman and raw powerlifting. I'm currently retired from competition due to problems with my left elbow. I broke it when I was 10 years old, I still lift at least 4 times per week, plus do other exercise in between. I find ways to work around my injuries.

**What’s your story? When

I'm a total geek. I've been a software developer my whole career. I could see the kind of body working at a desk and eating junk food was leading me towards, trying to improve my body composition and appearance, and then moved into strength sports quickly because I loved lifting heavy stuff.

**Do you want to share any athletic or fitness-related goals

All lifts are raw: Squat 315x42

**What is your workout or training regimen?**

I've done more programs than I can remember. I get bored easily

Westside: Good for equipped powerlifting. The whole philosophy is based around improving performance by bringing up weak points. I'm not sure if I buy into that completely. I don't like the box squat for powerlifting unless you're doing a very specific style of equipped squatting. I actually think it might be better for other athletes, etc., in order to train their hip extension power.

* Sheiko
: This is kind of the opposite of Westside. The philosophy is based around training specific movements and getting stronger by improving skill in those movements. Bringing up individual muscles is a far lower priority. I lean more towards this type of training for powerlifting

* Doggcrapp
: Excellent for somebody who wants to dual-focus in hypertrophy and strength. Can be very emotionally taxing because of the requirement to always add weight or reps every session. Not for beginners.
Smolov: This is a squat peaking program. I did my biggest squat ever after doing the 4-week base mesocycle. However, which I will eventually write about.

* 
Super-high frequency, but powerlifters, who usually only train heavy 3-4 times per week, can remain competitive in their 40s and 50s. There are a number of possible explanations for that, but I think the type of super-heavy super-high frequency training that oly lifters use is a contributing factor.

* 
Crossfit: A lot of the criticisms are valid, so to be good at Crossfit competitions, you have to train for it. And as soon as it's a sport and no longer just a training program, it's very hard to be critical of it.

**What does your diet look like? Do you take any supplements?**

Like my training

When trying to gain muscle, and not stop until my head hit the pillow.

When cutting fat or maintaining body composition (which is the majority of the time), and vegetables. I supplement these with some protein powder, nuts, and occasionally fruit and starch after training.

I like intermittent fasting
I've probably tried over a hundred different supplements. The ones that I've settled on for a good while now are just creatine monohydrate, and BCAAs.

**What is your competition and/or training philosophy?**
Over the long term

**What challenges do you face?**

I've had many injuries and other health problems

**How do you motivate yourself?**

I have so much to learn about motivation that it would be hubris for me to give advice. I'm happy to learn from anybody who wants to teach me. :)

**How do you deal with naysayers and clashes between your lifestyle and that of your SO/friends/co-workers?**

My wife has always been supportive of anything I want to do (except
As far as other people are concerned

**What advice do you take

Obviously, but you have to learn to have a healthy skepticism and a willingness to experiment to see what works for you.

**Any other little innovations you don't mind sharing?**

I got really great gains in the bench from following a protocol of a fast set of 3 with bands
155+bands x 3 300x3 155+bands x 3 310x3 155+bands x 3 315x3 155+bands x 3 320x3 155+bands x 3 325x2
I almost always have used straps for my deadlift training. I don't see any point to tearing up my hands unnecessarily. Assuming chalk use and a decent bar
And

**What injuries have you dealt with?**
Too many to remember. Many many muscle strains. I have a herniated L4-L5 disc that has bothered me for years. And of course

**What are the injury risks that come with your athletic endeavors? Any advice on how to deal with these injuries and risks?**

One semantic problem that I often see is that people don't distinguish clearly between health and fitness. While it's true that improving one's fitness will generally improve one's health, you need to be clear on your goals. If you're just doing this for health's sake, there's no need to try to squat 700 pounds. If you're doing it for the sake of competition or achievement, that's fine too, but you need to recognize that there's a trade-off involved.

**What are your favorite sports/fitness books/DVDs/websites?**

Uh, I like Robb Wolf, John Berardi, Martin Berkham, and Jonny Bowden. For fitness goals... well, it depends on the goal. I prefer to think in terms of ideas and philosophies than in the people who write about them.",,self,,

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyjnO53yPhw

I've been wanting to write down for a while why I love them and why I personally feel they should be an integral part of everyone's programming as I am full on Kool-Aid dunk on the fact that heavy TGUs are one of the best full body exercises around and nearly as such as heavy DLs. Now hear me out first before you say that's a load of tripe. However

I've been doing them for a bit over a year with a 44lb KB. I found they come pretty naturally to me, do 30 before the rest of my KB workout, etc. I always heard poeple say, ""Ya, it's a great core workout"" and I would think to myself, ""It's a hellofa lot more than that!"" It got me thinking about why they would say only that and realized by doing so many, I began to notice that I was completely fried at the end. I felt like my whole body was toast. Most people either don't do enough of them or they are not doing them heavy enough.

Well, did I feel it all over. So what did I feel all over? Read on to find out...

Benefits (in no particular order after Shoulder):


* **Low 'Volume'**: I do at most 20 reps total and I'm wiped.
* **Shoulder Health**: The benefits of shoulder packing are pretty well known. [Here is a great article from Bret Contreras' site.](http://bretcontreras.com/2010/05/guest-blog-shoulder-packing-by-joe-sansalone/). This should also have carry over to any shoulder press movements in addition to strengthening the entire joint.
* **Core**: Yes
* **Strength**: The TGU is really like 5 exercises in one (in progression): Floor Press, Weighted Lunge/Split Squat/Squat, and overall isometric hold. The more weight you do with each, obviously you will get stronger.
* **Focus**: A TGU takes ~30 secs to perform. Far longer than pretty much every other dynamic exercise. Concentrating on each part of the movement while holding heavy, there is very much will power and concentration needed to fight your fatigue and finish properly.
* **Proprioception**: When all you're looking at is the heavy bell over your face while performing a series of complex movements
* **Balance**: This pretty much speaks for it self. Try doing it without any weight and get up. Now imagine with a heavy weight in your hand. Any derivation from a proper path and you will dump the bell and/or fall over.
* **Flexibility**: You *will* learn to bend in the right ways and in a slow and controlled fashion to do a heavy TGU. 
* **Time under tension (on body)**: All that time under tension really puts a strain on your connective tissue (from your wrist right down to your toes) and I'm going to go a step further and say also your bones (but that's part of 'Things I Believe but Can't Prove'). Everyone knows that muscles get strong fast
* **Time under tension (on CVS)**: If your not breathing hard after a heavy TGU
* **Grip**: You will feel it in your forearm and wrist. You are crushing the bell to hold it in place. Your wrist is preventing any lateral movements. They are doing them at the same time for a prolonged period. Your grip will get tired by the end.
* **Confidence**: What can I say

So there you have it. Why I think you all should be doing Heavy TGUs. I would like to add one caveat:

*Do not go heavier than 45 lbs until you are rock solid with a TGU*. 

There are many ways to fuck up and if I hadn't done 100s of TGUs before starting dumbells

However, TGU is plenty safe and will provide you with a multitude of benefits.",,False,self,t5_2s9km,True,,

**What sports or fitness activities are you involved in?**

&gt;I’ve been involved in practically every sport at some point

**Do you compete at any level?**

&gt;Not yet!

**What’s your story? When

&gt;Until a little over a year ago, and since I’m not the kind of person who is content with settling into the fat part of a bell curve, I decided to “get in shape”. I started by reading a text on personal training and browsing some online forums (but not this one, unfortunately), where I learned how critical building muscle mass via strength training is for, well, everything.

&gt;I was immediately drawn to the challenge of lifting heavy, some aspects of which I’ve carried over to the assistance work I do nowadays.

**Do you want to share any athletic or fitness-related goals

&gt;[225x2 Deadlift](http://youtu.be/lSjzjz9wYJs?t=1m17s)

&gt;Goal: reach an Elite total of 703 (250s/170b/321d) before I turn 25 (a little over a year from now…).  I’d also like to give Olympic style lifting a try and enter an amateur Figure competition eventually.

**What is your workout or training regimen?**

&gt;I’m currently following Wendler’s 5/3/1 (I’m so original!). I like it because it’s simple and effective while allowing enough time &amp; energy for creativity with assistance work

**What does your diet look like? Do you take any supplements?**

&gt;My diet is composed mainly of colorful vegetables, take daily creatine, whey, fish oil, Vit D, E, and BCAAs when fasted training

**What have you achieved so far? What are your ‘numbers’ (times, etc)?**

&gt;[Most recent numbers](http://i.imgur.com/WGFLO.png)

**What is your competition and/or training philosophy?**

&gt;3 things: Consistency, keep at it, never give in, and don’t be stupid.

**What challenges do you face?**

&gt;I struggle with the Consistency portion of that triad. I love to challenge myself

**How do you motivate yourself?**

&gt;The most effective motivational tool is to set clear, even if you’re not seeing the kind of progress you want. That’s not always easy to keep in mind though when you’re constantly trying to be your best, so I struggle with this a lot.

**How do you deal with naysayers and clashes between your lifestyle and that of your SO/friends/co-workers?**

&gt;Lifting has become an integral part of who I am. It’s a huge source of confidence, it can feel like a rejection of who I am as a person. I try to just ignore it, but it definitely gets under my skin sometimes.

&gt;I’ve also found it challenging to date when the majority of my limited free time is spent at the gym or researching and blogging. But for all other social responsibilities

**What advice do you take

&gt;I ignore guru-ism and anecdotal tips if they are given in absolutes. Everything else I consider worth giving a shot.

**What are some training or diet-related things you know are true but cannot prove?**

&gt;Endurance cardio promotes suicidal thoughts.

**Is there anything that you do differently in your sport/training/diet that you've never seen others do?**

&gt;Not really. I’m not nearly advanced enough to think creatively about training.

**Any other little innovations you don't mind sharing?**

&gt;If your gym “doesn’t allow chalk”

**What injuries have you dealt with? What are the injury risks that come with your athletic endeavors?**

&gt;I have all kinds of issues with my left foot due to multiple sprains/pulls/hairline fractures from my days playing contact sports. Luckily

**Any advice on how to deal with these injuries and risks?**

&gt;Listen to your body. Egos heal faster than tendons.

**What are your favorite sports/fitness books/DVDs/websites?**

&gt;I have a [blog](http://swolesister.wordpress.com/), and personal anecdotes thrown in. I also make fun of stock images. It’s kind of interesting, if you want to check it out.

**Anything else you want to add?**

&gt;Soapbox time!

&gt;I believe that physical strength is achieved primarily via strength of character and strength of will. It takes serious balls to walk up to the bar alone for the first time in a sea of swole and max out at double digits. Somebody holding your hand through the entire process won’t motivate you to grind out that last rep or to keep squatting week after week even though you had to deload to novice weight because your form is abysmal. 

&gt;This is why dedicated weightlifters are some of the most secure, make mistakes, and learn from them, you don’t belong in the weightroom. Also, you’re in my way.",,False,t5_2s9km,True

**The Stats**

* 104kg weigh in
* 7 successful lifts
* Squat: 145kg/319.5lbs; 150kg/330.5lbs *(PR)*; **157.5kg/347lbs *(PR)***
* Bench: 127.5kg/281lbs *(two reds)* 
* Deadlift: 167.5kg/369lbs
* Total: 480kg/1056lbs

**The Experience**

One word: Amazing

I initially was going to enter the 220 class

* I didn't feel like losing 5-6 lb (I know
* I didn't feel like driving to AC at 5am. Instead
* It was not going to make a difference in me winning or losing

I'm so glad I did the afternoon session. There were only 8 guys in the entire flight and only one guy younger than me (who won best overall lifter with 722.5kgs) and everyone was awesome and helpful:

* I met John Bogart: WR setter in March for 275lb with a 750lb bench. I got to help him warmup by holding a 2-board for him on bench while he 'warmed-up' with like 600lbs for a couple reps.  He hit a PR of 760lbs. On my first bench video
* I met Stan Chatis: 74yr old multiple world and american record holder. *(He set another American record in DL)* Talk about old man strength! Outlifted me in all three lifts. He's the one you can hear on my last DL video cheering me on.
* I met Doug Currance: Part of the USA World Team (along with the two guys above)
* I saw a collegiate bench press record and also an American Masters II squat record (Doug).
* Several other awesome guys with experience who helped me calm my nerves and have fun.

**How it went down**

I got up early *(4 year old)*, 4g of beta-alanine and two scoops of [Green Vibrance](http://www.vibranthealth.us/?p2=/modules/vibranthealth/product.jsp&amp;id=27&amp;category=52) all mixed together in a shaker and I made myself a 3 shot Cafe Americano.

We hit the road and stopped for some food halfway there and I grabbed a Vente from Burntbucks to power myself later.

We got there and speant a little time trying to find the ballroom and found it during the final couple rounds of the morning sessions DL's and was good to see how it was working and [the set up](http://i.imgur.com/dP9MD.jpg).

It was very organized and the setup was very well presented. They had software that showed the lifters

They asked us to find our rack heights before we signed in so I went to found those with the help of guy who loads the bars and signed-in and got weighed *(so fat)*. I had 90 mins so I ate a sandwich...

About 40 mins before, mounatin climbers and jumping jacks). I also downed another 1.5 scoops of ON mixed with coffee. Then hit the bars for a typical 1 RM warmup. My last warmup was a single at 305...then the stage.

I was really nervous but luckily, squatted and got three white lights. Woohoo! That wasn't so bad.

I picked only 5lbs more than my last 1RM for second because in the past that 10 lbs from easy to fail has happened

Since that went so well

There was a 20 min rest between squat and bench

The warmup area had only two bars

I think my last warm-up (275) was a little too close to my opener (281) and that may have fatigued me. I nailed the opener easy

This kind of through me and unsettled some of my confidence. I had planned to go for 300 on second attempt, but I could tell my energy was draining a bit. Probably coming down form the initial high. I was going back and trying to eat some snickers and coffee but I think it was too late. 303lb was a bust but at least I got my bench in.

Another 20 mins for DL warmups

Again

My mind was slipping and I forgot to snap my belt on opener but it was easy. Like squat, folks, lemme PR more!

**What I learned**

* I'm now a powerlifting junkie. 
* Strategizing the *(only)* three lifts needs more work.
* My confidence is high and my once goal of 300/400/500 is now 400/500/600.
* I have broken through mental barriers on squat and DL and my belief levels are sky high
* I feel happy there is something I can compete in again since the glory days of H.S.
* Met some awesome guys
* I'm too fat :op

So

**What sports or fitness activities are you involved in? Do you compete at any level?** 

Weightlifting, but primarily Olympic weightlifting - I haven't competed yet, though I intend to do a meet or two one day. I'd love to be coached/handled, but there aren't any athletic clubs where I live, and a severe scarcity of knowledgeable strength training people. I plan on getting back into the equestrian scene eventually, as I used to compete in the show rings and cross-country courses... probably never doing a swim meet again though, screw those starting block heart attacks.

**What’s your story? When

My dad, and continued to compete through much of my young life. At 6’4 and 305, his stature demanded attention, and he worked hard for it. As a result, I’ve been in gyms since I was a kid. At ten years old, I was drinking protein shakes to be like daddy, and at sixteen I joined the swim team

After a bout of teenage stupidrexia that left me 95lbs and miserable, and gradually began to grasp the idea that lifting weights wouldn’t instantly turn me into the Hulk like my dad. I gained a foundation in proper form, persistence and consistency from him (or as he would say, ""she got her OCD from me.""), and went off to college basking in the glow of having overpowered the wild, rampant misinformation on how the body works. I got my nutrition in order and started gaining healthy muscle mass, though the process was slow.

On March 24th, and I would be flying home to my mom and brother the next day. For those who know what it’s like to lose your hero, someone you love and look up to desperately, you may understand, for those who don’t, you can’t possibly imagine. Everything in my nineteen-year-old world came to a halt, except my workouts. I’ve seen a squat rack through the blur of tears more times than I care to admit. I became a regular on his fitness board, supplements, or as I like to call it ""El Bible"" (BEE-blay). It was a snowball of dedication from there on out. I turned into something of an addict, I did weights. I even scheduled classes around the times I wanted to train

With help from the members of my dad’s fitness forum, I feel somewhat lucky that most people at Impact accept and even encourage me. Every other week someone asks me if I’m competing… [I’ve even been in their commercial!](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0dznU10Dtc) (:22 clumsy jerk with the absurd red socks) While I’ve relaxed my obsession and eased my depression with the help of cannabis to allow a tame social life, my dedication and actual love of weightlifting hasn’t waned. Many a time as I’m walking through the gym I’ve thought to myself, ""I’ll never let this go. I know for sure that I’m going to be doing this always.""

**What are your current athletic or fitness-related goals?** 

Hmm, whether I have a goal in mind or not. But I suppose as any good weightlifter should desire, I want to increase my strength as much as I can while maintaining or decreasing my body weight.

**What is your workout or training regimen?** 

Three to four days a week of weightlifting preceded by a dynamic cardio warmup. Cardio isn’t my focus, cycling, rock climbing, etc. As far as my lifting routine, I train lifts, not muscles, and I've been following a linear progression model (like the [Bill Starr 5×5](http://startingstrength.wikia.com/wiki/Bill_Starr_5x5)) for a few years now; it's the most reliable program I've found. Depending on how I feel and where I am in my training cycle I alternate my focus on different lifts. I pretty much let myself snatch and C&amp;J (the Olympic lifts) all I want barring their interference with my other lifts.

**What does your diet look like? Do you take any supplements?** 

I typically follow a Paleo-ish diet composed primarily of lean meats, eggs, sprouted grains, oats and whey/casein protein (often considered a supplement). No starchy/yeasty carbs, preservatives, refined sugar, mystery meat, gluten, and Splenda in my tea – deal with it. (Everything else is liquid candy, prep meals in advance and drink a metric fuck-ton of water. I can actually be quite the food-elitist; if it’s mass-produced like the stuff you get from most fast food chains or restaurants

The basic rule I follow is to focus carbohydrate intake (both complex and simple) around workouts and mornings. I won’t pretend that I’ve put myself through any real hardcore pre-competition dieting, or “today I had seven almonds for a snack”, just proper macronutrient timing and quality above all else. On that note, I feel as though it wouldn't be terrible difficult for me to try out a contest prep diet.

As for supplements, I also include a standard multi, EFA oil (essential fatty acids), joint supplement (glucosamine-chondroitin/MSM), green phyters, some kidney/liver support, BCAAs, B12 and antioxidants among others. My CEE (creatine ethyl ester) cycles in and out… but usually in. I also use Glucorell-R before a carb-heavy meal to blunt insulin response and utilize the carbohydrates efficiently.

**What have you achieved so far? What are your ‘numbers’ (times, etc)?** 

Height: 5’4.5 Weight: 135-145lbs

Current 1RMs 

Squat: 245lbs 

Bench Press: 155lbs 

Deadlift: 250lbs 

Clean &amp; Jerk: 165lbs 

Snatch: 125lbs

**What challenges do you face?** 

Being a young female in the weight room has been a challenge. Hell, I've been hit on, ogled and hassled in the past by idiots with big egos and tiny nutsacks - psh, a GIRL doesn't know squat form better than ME! - but that has largely dissipated as I've grown and gotten stronger/confident. The proof is in the big plates and big legs.

**How do you motivate yourself?** 

I don't really need motivation. I love weightlifting. In fact, that if you’re not motivated enough, then you don’t want it badly enough. If you want it, you’ll make it a priority, make it a habit; if you see it as a chore, you’ll get lazy and make excuses. I think it’s difficult for some because the reward mechanism isn’t 
usually immediate. Consistency is key to making any sort of progress.

**How do you deal with naysayers and clashes between your lifestyle and that of your SO/friends/co-workers?** 

Not too many naysayers - a lot of average gym-goers seem to enjoy watching me lift, or at the very least has come to watch me lift. I'm not sure if they feel emasculated, are trying to keep up with me, or just picked up on my habits, but it's pertinent to note that I tend toward variety, and I realize that my dedication to the gym is somewhat a-typical. The most obnoxious thing is probably my peers' desires to drink or stay awake until 2am for no reason. Not tonight, dude
(Note: this doesn't mean I'm boring and never party

**What advice do you take

I only take advice from people who obviously have more experience than I do in strength athleticism... those who lift what I want to lift or look how I want to look. Smart old pros with a sort of knowing swagger are my favorite people. :) I tend to avoid anyone my age

**What are some training or diet-related things you know are true but cannot prove?** 

Knowing something is true without being able to prove it sounds a lot like ignorance or faith to me

**What injuries have you dealt with? What are the injury risks that come with your athletic endeavors?** 

Pulled/twisted/strained muscles and crackling joints are the only problems I've had. They've been minimal

**Any advice on how to deal with these injuries and risks?** 

Proper form is utterly necessary. Joint supplements and The Grid foam roller are fantastic aids, compression, elevation.

**What are your favorite sports/fitness books/DVDs/websites?** 

I like the old school shit by Mark Rippetoe... can't really go wrong there. [T-Nation](http://www.t-nation.com/) usually has some pretty sensible articles, but they have good prices on the necessary stuff.

**Anything else you want to add?**

To make up for not being able to run I did spin classes, its both mentally and physically confusing.

**A Few Words on Safety:**

It’s surprisingly easy to fuck somebody up with massage. A thorough knowledge of anatomy is vital for the safety of all involved parties. In particular, femoral triangle, sternal notch, anterior/posterior triangles of the neck, cubital area, medial brachium and axilla, etc. If you don’t know where those locations are or what runs through them, but not all bursas are vulnerable to massage. I’ll try to guide you away from the ones that don’t respond well when I present on that area of the body.

Furthermore, depending on where you’re working and what you’re trying to do. Massage puts stress on the body, so it needs to be done with training load in mind. It’s hard to pull off a PR when you’re still recovering from the session with your therapist.

Finally, rash, osteoporosis, open wounds, diminished sensation, painkillers, alcohol, don’t fucking touch it.

**Massage vs. Manual Therapy:**

There is an increasing propensity for massage therapists of varying levels of training to identify themselves professionally as manual therapists. While technically true

**A Brief Overview of Systems:**

There are a buttload of massage systems out there

*Deep Tissue:*

This name means nothing other than the therapist has learned to lower their table and push hard. Hundreds of different techniques fall under this umbrella and it’s only really useful for distinguishing between techniques within a system. If a therapist tells you they “specialize in deep tissue” don’t let them touch you.

*Myofascial Release:*

This is any type of bodywork designed to release myofascial restrictions to improve somatic function. It’s also a term used in place of therapeutic massage when someone wants to sound technical. Some complete systems have been built around it

*Sports Massage:*

Sports massage is any massage technique performed with the intent of improving sport performance or recovery. As such, maintenance, or treatment of chronic injury. Not all massage therapists are trained in all of the objectives of sports massage.

Russian sports massage is very systematic and comprehensive, a proper Russian sports massage will almost always be full-body, with the injury treated separately after the general massage or pre/post event techniques interspersed in the general massage. Has a reputation of being one of the best researched massage systems in existence. Sometimes known for never using forearm or elbow techniques.

*Trigger Point Therapy:*

This is a common and basic system built around relieving myofascial trigger points (sometimes called “knots”) through ischemic compression, as it doesn’t precisely describe what is going on in the tissue. A trigger point is characterized by a few distinct traits:

* Tender/sensitive, or after palpation
* Palpable
* Referred pain
* Increased

A successful treatment requires a significant knowledge of functional anatomy

Trigger point therapy serves as the foundation for Neuromuscular Therapy. NMT is a much more complete system of treatment and is more suitable to specialize in than a single tool like trigger point therapy. (As an aside

*PNF/CRAC Stretching:*

Proprioceptive Neuromuscular Facilitation is a system developed to treat neuromotor dysfunction, then goes through active range of motion, at the limits of which a stretch is manually applied. These techniques are characterized by active movement on the part of the recipient and recruitment of proprioceptive reflexes. Also known as Active Isolated Stretching, Post-Isometric Relaxation, and fucking magic. Can tax recovery systems dramatically.

*Positional Release Technique:*

This technique peaked in popularity over the last few years with ATC’s and PT’s, and its associated pain, can be relieved by manually shortening the injured tissue to interrupt the vicious cycle of tension and pain. You can think of it as a more advanced way of holding what hurts to make it hurt less. It’s useful in acute injury or with active trigger points where muscle guarding is preventing the therapist from doing more meaningful work. But there are many other ways to accomplish this, often in a shorter time. Some consider PRT a derivative of techniques in NMT.

*ART/STR/Tack and Floss/Pin and Stretch:*

Active assistive techniques operate on the principle of restricting specific layers of tissues, as it’s done with an elastic band rather than manually, while Pin and Stretch techniques often involve passive ROM. These techniques can have a very powerful effect in resolving somatic dysfunction, and as such, the bulk of techniques that I demonstrate in upcoming videos will be based in these systems.

*IASTM/AStym/Graston/Gua-Sha:*

All forms of Instrument Assisted Soft Tissue Manipulation, often stopping when the skin is too compromised to continue. The research is all over the place, with conflicts of interest everywhere you look, but a lot of pros swear by it. Certification and tools can run anywhere from fifty bucks to several thousands of dollars (looking at you, Graston...) but you can get by with the back edge of a butter knife and some tiger balm. These are incredibly popular lately, but they’re not the be-all, end-all of soft tissue treatments.

*Swedish Massage:*

This is a term that describes the generic fluff-n-buff with maybe occasional deeper techniques, as it requires the least technical knowledge. Not typically something I would recommend for athletes, but it can be useful for overtrained or highly stressed individuals. I will not be demonstrating any of it.

*Shiatsu/Thai Yoga Massage:*

These systems involve rocking, but probably not very often, at least in this series.

That’s all for this installment. The following articles will be much less text-heavy and will feature video demonstrations of stuff you can do yourself. I recorded the first couple of clips at my meet earlier this month

Alright, I need to say thanks to some people:

* [Scottydog28](http://www.reddit.com/user/scottydog28): Talking me leading up to the meet, etc.
* [Abeawastaken]( http://www.reddit.com/r/AdvancedFitness/comments/jk9r8/member_spotlight_abeawastaken/): Double-checked and gave advice on water loading/cutting weight/rehydrating.  Considering I was 55.9kg
* [Suppy](http://www.reddit.com/user/suppy): Frozen pop-tarts.  If you haven’t tried them, anything helps, and this did.  Also, the cold from the pop-tarts made me think I was getting a bit hydrated.
* [Zahrada](http://www.reddit.com/user/Zahrada): Bench press recommendation of Smolov Jr.  Probably the single biggest factor I noticed during the meet.
* [Silverhydra](http://www.reddit.com/user/silverhydra): Damn good nutritional and supplement advice.  He made cutting (actual) weight and keeping performance easier/possible.
* Everyone else – I’m sure there’s people I’m forgetting

So, it went much better than expected, by far.  Cutting weight was a pain in the ass and I was literally dying for water come Thursday night.  Abeawastaken gave me some awesome advice for water loading and it definitely paid off.  I ended up eating some carbs and water Thursday after I compared my scale to the meet scale.  I feel like this contributed tons to my lifts.  If I went into the meet without those carbs (mmm, pop-tarts) I doubt I would have had the energy I did.  Rehydration went well.  I had some pedialyte, water, beef jerky, coffee

Warm-ups for squat went pretty well.  I did 135 and it felt like nothing, but I knew I could get 308.  When I got 308, I didn’t realize it’d be that fast.  I kept to my game plan with squats of 5kg increases because I had to sink them.  I got white lights for 319 and 330.  330 was interesting because it felt like I *almost* paused at the bottom but it was just really slow at the bottom.  If I didn’t sink them as deep, I could have gone heavier, but I’d rather go light and get what I needed.  After going 3/3 on squats, I was pumped for bench.

Warm-ups for bench were solid.  Everything was going fast on and had no issues.  I went into my opener with no idea what would happen.  I did Smolov Jr. on Zahrada’s recommendation and it really paid off.  181 flew up pretty fast.  I wasn’t sure how 192 was going to feel so I decided to stick with the plan and do a 5kg increase.  When that flew up, I would have gone to 215 instead.  But hey, that’s *definitely* a meet PR by almost 20 lbs.

Deadlifts!  My favorite lift of all.  I did my usual warm-ups and they felt good.  I put in 407 as my opener which is something I was confident I would get (as I did 2x415 the week prior).  That went faster than expected.  I was debating during warm-ups between doing 440 instead of 418 for my second attempt and I succumbed to my weight greed.  I put 200kg in for my 2nd attempt (with the intent of not doing a 3rd if I got it).  200kg/440lbs went up better than expected.  I knew it wasn’t a max, but I risk injuring myself.  I already hit my goal of qualifying, set PRs, didn’t miss a lift, etc. so I figured stop before something bad happens.  Apparently, I hit a 981 lb total and raw elite is 984 … had I known that, I would have put in a 3rd attempt, just gotta go elite at the Arnold in 2012.

So, bar-none, the best meet I’ve ever done.  I’d like to sincerely thank everyone for their support, you have no idea how much it means to me.  I was checking the FCJ between squat/bench/deadlift and it really motivated me, made me smile a lot, and pushed me knowing there were people out there watching what I was doing.  Awards are later tonight and I’m gonna see what I need to do to submit my entry for the Arnold … I’m really looking forward to that.  If anyone goes, let me know!  Other than that

**What sports or fitness activities are you involved in? Do you compete at any level?**

I currently compete as an amateur Strongman (about to enter my 4th contest in October) I hope to compete in my first Raw Powerlifting meet in the next few months. I'm also interested in finding a Olympic lifting coach at some point.

**What’s your story? When

I come from big people, I fell in love with the weight room. I was the strongest kid at my school as a freshman, breaking 4 of the 5 weight room records. I lost a ton of weight. By junior year I lettered in Football, Wrestling and Track &amp; Field (discus and shot put), was 223lbs at my lightest (not sure what my BF% was, but I did have visible abs without flexing.) I was talking to some coaches from some D1 and D2 colleges, and had some full ride scholarship opportunities...

Then the shit hit the fan. For the purpose of length I'll run through this...

* Broke an ankle during a summer pick up game of football. It was misdiagnosed as a Type 2 sprain. Trained on it. 3 month later the pain was so bad I went back to the doctor and found out it was actually broken and I had destroyed my ankle and needed surgery...no senior year sports. Lost all my scholarship opps.
* Dad lost his job and family business wasn't doing so great.
* Broke up with girlfriend of 5 years.
* Started partying hard (alcohol and drugs)
* Get a call from my Mom 2 month into my 2nd year at college. She tells me she has cancer. She passes on shortly after.
* Dad loses his shit and turns to the bottle.
* I leave college to take care of our family business and my pops.

I woke up one morning, with drug induced raccoon eyes. After some thought, I realized that I’d have to find a sport if I wanted to get back in shape. It was the only way I could think of keeping myself accountable. I had done one (“mickey mouse”) strongman contest in high school that was held at a local junior college and came in 2nd place. So, I did some research online and found my coach. Shot him an email asking if I could train with him, and after a few months and a lot of hard work trying to prove myself, he took me under his wing.

Things got a little better...then my pops fell into foreclosure.

When I saw the foreclosure notice, but I was still fat. So on December 27th, 2010 I decided to lose the weight. As of August 1st, I'm 46 down lbs. and I got my father out of foreclosure :)

**What are your current athletic or fitness-related goals?**

**Goal Body Weight** 250lbs (reevaluate from there.)

**Strength Goal**

* 3xBW Squat &amp; Deadlift
* 2xBW Bench
* 1.5xBW OHP

**Athletic Goals**

*Short Term*

* Place top 3 at a Silver or Gold level Strongman contest.
* Total elite at my first Raw PL meet.

*Long Term*

* Place top 3 at a Platinum Plus level strongman contest (/Pro Card)
* Total over 2000 at a Raw PL meet
* Start competing in Olympic Weightlifting on the local level.

**What is your workout or training regimen?**

I would like to train 4 days a week, and 1 day for strongman events.

I have enough experience and a world class coach

* The West Side Conjugate Method for strength and speed
* The Bulgarian Method for slight strength gains and work capacity
* Big Sac(ramento) Crew Method. Its unpublished but was put together by the old school Sacramento/Richmond Strongman Crew my coach was a part of. Its great for conditioning and work capacity.
5/3/1 for deloading

This may look confusing

I’m currently flirting with the idea of adding some of my old football conditioning work back into my training to help speed along the weight loss. I wasn’t planning on doing this until I was into the 200s, you ran when you were a little fat fuck freshmen, why not run now?” This would include Hill Sprints, Stadium Stairs, Ladder and Dot drills, and some Combine Drills.

**What does your diet look like? Do you take any supplements?**

The best way to describe my diet is Low carb. I try to stay &lt;100g on non training days, or unsweetened tea I don't drink it. This has worked up until the last few months, and I’ve kind of hit a plateau (I’ve only lost 3 lbs in the last 2 ½ months ;( ). Anyone think they can help me out?

I eat clean from Sunday to Friday (4:59pm), then that’s 2 cheats and i'm done until next week. If I plan on going out with friends, then I eat clean and just drink as my cheat.

Supps:

* Whey
* Fish Oil
* Multi
* Fiber

I don't put much stock into supplements

**What have you achieved so far? What are your ‘numbers’ (times, etc)?**

(All Raw)

Bench - 345lbs

Dead - 705lbs

Squat - 635lbs (have not taken a true squat max yet. This weight was quick

OHP - 315lbs

40in box jump @ 365+ (did it 9 months ago as a bet. Not bad for a fatass)****

**What is your competition and/or training philosophy?**

**On Competition:**

""Remember, but if you’re in a competition and you don't mind losing or give it your all, you're wasting your time.)

On Training:

""You want science and studies? Fuck you

**What challenges do you face?**

Working 3 jobs (75-80 hours a week). I'm tired all the time and the stress takes its toll.

**How do you motivate yourself?**

I try to remember what it was like to be awful.

When shit got tough, you are acting like a bitch, and you are fucking soft. Now, what are you going to do about it?”

So, so the mantra I’ve used, which I think sums up the whole “motivation” thing is this:

Being weak of mind and body is unacceptable.

**What advice do you take

I'll take advice from anyone that is/was better than me. ""Better"" is also relative, it's still amazing for their size.

**What are some training or diet-related things you know are true but cannot prove?**

Slow, but useless for strength.

Potstickers are the ultimate food. They have the perfect balance of Protein to Fat to Carb ratio. Also, S, and G...

**What injuries have you dealt with? What are the injury risks that come with your athletic endeavors?**

As a child I've had arthroscopic surgery on my right knee to repair my MCL. I broke my right ring finger and it healed all screwy (I always know when it's going to rain when my figure starts throbing lol.) Also had my ankle surgery. They all hurt once in a while

**Any advice on how to deal with these injuries and risks?**

Listen to your body. Only you know what works and doesn't.

**What are your favorite sports/fitness books/DVDs/websites?**

## Enter: the humble **Floor L-sit**

A lot of people attempt or try the L-seat, but learning it on the floor improves lower trap pressing strength, because you will need to press downward hard to lift your legs off the ground.

If you can do an L-sit on PBs, try this: sit down on the ground and push up into an L-sit. Could you even lift off the ground? Probably not. Now, tuck your legs in so you're seated with your feet flat on the ground. Use your feet to assist and push yourself up with your hands. I'll bet you lifted yourself a few inches higher than when you attempted the floor L-sit.

The issue here is the same as with the pullup - you cannot handle your full bodyweight load. So to train this

## But how do I train it?

* ** Age?**


Just turned 21 (last Valentine's Day).

* ** Sex?**


Male.

* **What sports or fitness activities are you involved in? Do you compete at any level?
**

At the moment

* **What’s your story? When


I started out a fat

I started out playing for a city league

I started in the gym on a basic 'Powerbodybuilding' program in my third season

After that, further fuelled my new PRs and new landmarks on my body (such as being over 200lbs and under 10% BF)

* ** What are your current athletic or fitness-related goals?**

Currently my only set goal is to rehab my damn shoulder. Beyond that I have no goals as I am too near-sighted. I would like to Bridge Press more than 400 in the next few months and Glute Bridge over 800 this summer though. Sometime in the next year or so I want to pull 600 from the floor (Currently my numbers for those three are 385

* ** What is your workout or training regimen? Feel free to provide as much detail as you want.**

It recently underwent a change:

Day 1: Legs

Day 2: Vertical push/pull

Day 3: Horizontal push/pull

Day 4: Arm hypertrophy

I start every workout with an exercise that I must be fresh for (Overhead Squat, etc.), which is usually done for strength and with a barbell. My next exercise is done with DBs or something more joint friendly for volume (Usually 10x10, but not GVT timing). Then I do what feels good after that.

* **What does your diet look like? Do you take any supplements?**

I'm going to get sooooo much flak for this section...

Waking up to stimulants and leucine.

Fasting until 3pm or so.

Break my fast with workout nutrition (250-500kcal of glucose and 500kcal whey protein, leucine (all 15g), 2g DMAE, cinnamon, potassium, salt).

Afterwards I head to get my postworkout meal of 2-3 big crunches from KFC (depending on how much I can stuff my face with)

Later on I have 6-12 raw eggs in a shaker bottle with a scoop of protein and more veggie extract

If I were to go shopping and make either borscht or chili

As for supplements
The above ones in my workout nutrition.

Supplements to avoid deficiencies; Vitamin D, Potassium, Fish oil, Metamucil, choline, etc. (At the end of the day I meet all nutrient needs, despite the diet looking like shit)

And some extras: Caffeine (either Lo-carb Monster or Jack3d) and ephedrine. Sometimes I go Black Widow on the fat burner. I have some Chromium, Aniracetram, Vinpocetine, Rhodiola Rosea, Bromelain (those two taken pre-workout) Piracetam, which sucks; and some B-phenylethylamine. I recently shipped to my home some mitochondrial support from LEF (Mostly CoQ10 and Quercetin) to test out in the future.

God damn it this is going to be a fun section to talk about :D

* **What have you achieved so far? What are your ‘numbers’ (times, etc)?**

Currently around 210-215 at 5'10 and sub 10% body fat

Bench Press is 360 and Bridge Press is 385

Deadlift is 515

Back squat is 445 (Have not even done this in about a year)

Other notable weight achievements are my insanity sets (where safety and logic are thrown out the window when my mind blanks), and Bench pressed 275x14. All belted and the Rows strapped as well.

* **What is your competition and/or training philosophy?**

My philosophy outside of the gym is that ""The better I do in the gym, and the more studied I become; the less likely I will need to get a regular 9-5 hellhole job in the future when I leave this prison called University""

In the gym, becoming more canine than human around weights.

* **What challenges do you face?**

My own stupidity. I rarely rest and I push my rehab to the limits (hurt shoulder? Okay then, I'm not crippled yet)

Intellectually, saturated fats; and either cannot think critically or will be looked down upon if they do.

Seriously
End rant :D

* **How do you motivate yourself?**

Music. I have pretty much every genre on my Ipod and every now and then a song just hits me. Usually my best Insanity sets are done when a song makes my entire body flush with adrenaline; I have not done an insanity set without a song fuelling me to do so.

Name dropping [touhou](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touhou_Project) here as all

* **How do you deal with naysayers and clashes between your lifestyle and that of your SO/friends/co-workers?**

Family and friends are understanding

* **What advice do you take

I take a lot of advice

* **What are some training or diet-related things you know are true but cannot prove?**

I have a boner for fucoxanthine, the better, and that you can NOT overtrain unless you are working out 2-3 times a day with a subpar diet, over a period of months. (This may be rescinded when you olympic lift 400lbs for 2-a-days).

* **Is there anything that you do differently in your sport/training/diet that you've never seen others do?**

My periworkout supplementation is pretty unique. I get a lot of idea's from Biotest's [Anaconda Protocol](http://www.t-nation.com/anaconda2.jsp)


* **Any other little innovations you don't mind sharing?**

If you intermittent fast. Your first 'pulse' of the day is a bunch of stimulants (EC + yohimbine) with some green tea and leucine. The next time you pulse (2 hours later) it is fish oil and fucoxanthine. repeat this process 2-3 times.

Try to gain fat and lose muscle while doing this; you won't be able to.

* **What injuries have you dealt with? What are the injury risks that come with your athletic endeavors?**

Insanity sets bring huge injury potential, insanity sets on bench and cable crossovers while ditching the DB rows has possibly led to internal impingement and reduced thoracic mobility)
I've only dealt with easily rehabable injuries; a partially torn hamstring,000,000lb Incline Leg Press volume challenge and, at the quarter way mark, suffered a cerebral contusion from high blood pressure.

* **Any advice on how to deal with these injuries and risks?**

Nope
Belt up though

* **What are your favorite sports/fitness books/DVDs/websites?**

**My Training:** I've been lifting for just over three years now, I decided to do the squat workout twice a week, with additional squats on deadlift day for assistance work. (Thank you Blenderate.) This was because my squat has been seriously lacking, and thinking back to this time last year, I could barely put up 315lb on a good day. What I called ""PRs"" then were probably high, and at a much higher bodyweight. The reason for all this squatting was that my squat sucked ass compared to my other lifts and was really holding back my projected total. 

For bench I did a lot more close grip and reverse grip bench work towards the end

The deadlift. This has always been my strongest lift and because of that since November I've laid off of doing much of it except for when my program called for. I've always switched back and forth between conventional pulling and sumo pulling. For the competition I pulled sumo because as of late my sumo has been very strong without causing much pain or soreness in my lower back that comes from pulling conventional for me; for the record my conventional PR is 455lb. I essentially let the increase in squat frequency and intensity take care of my deadlift knowing that as my squat went up

**The Cut:** First of all, and will continue to do so; because glory is a feeling the weak willed, faint of heart, and fearful will never know. 

Back in October to the beginning of November I was regularly weighing in around 165 to 170lb. Towards the end of November and beginning of December it was more like 160 - 165lb. I accomplished this by just eating less bread by switching to low carb tortillas for my lunches which are usually grilled chicken wraps. I also stopped eating as much pizza and other related ""junk."" Once Thanksgiving passed I knew it was time to buckle down. I made a conscious decision to eat less than 100g of carbs a day

Now the Saturday before the meet, about a pound of meat for lunch, and then for dinner about another pound of meat with some broccoli. I stopped eating beef on Tuesday, eating only chicken on Wednesday. My last meal before weigh in was Wednesday evening (48 hour fast). I also cut back drastically on fluids at that time. Thursday morning I woke up at 156lb. That day I cut back my fluid intake to two 15oz Rock Star 2x energy drinks, a Rock Star Lemonade, and 1/2 litre of water. 

Thursday night I did four cycles of hot baths and showers, 15 minutes sauna, 10 minutes out. Repeat three times. When I got home I took another hot shower.  

Got home weighed myself at a somewhat uncomfortable 148.4

I got to the gym for weigh-ins and made weight at 146.4lb. Fuck. Yes. 

These cutting methods can be much more eloquently detailed and scientifically backed in the following Chaos and Pain blogs. (NSFW Obviously) [Edit: I'd like to thank Jamie for providing the below information as it made this cut a lot easier to do

Sure, or had severe muscle cramps. I'm an adult, I'l make my own damn decisions. 

[Me at 146.4lb](http://i.imgur.com/TAAFR.jpg)

Oh

**The Meet:** This shit was exciting as fuck. I got there and was pumped. My lifting parter (Who I've lifted with all of four times) was there and equally as pumped. Warm ups went nice. I warmed up to a double at 275lb and then got a single at 295lb in the squat.

**Squat:** My opener was 319lb and it flew up. My second squat attempt was in the 340's and it went up pretty well too. Here is my last squat:

[Third Attempt: 374lb Squat](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PUlo8P6cYQ) This is a PR. I've done a 375lb squat ""to a box"" but that was done at 160lbs bodyweight and the depth

**Bench:** Warmed up and felt great. Got up to a 205lb and a 225lb single warming up and both felt great. My first attempt was 240ish pounds. My second attempt:

[Second Attempt: 264lb Bench](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzMMWy_l-ws) 

This was my best successful attempt. By no means a PR, tried to get 283lb but the weight only went half way up where it got stuck. Maybe I could have grinded it out in they gym, but the judges weren't having it and called for the spotters. Oh well, next time. 

**Deadlift** Warm ups went well. Worked up to a 405lb single and killed it. My first attempt was 419lb

[Third Attempt: 473lb Deadlift](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-tWphimYkI)

This I'll call a PR because the 475lb I did in the gym was at a much higher bodyweight and I hitched it up. This went up so easily that if I were in the state of mind I could have asked the judges for a 4th attempt to go for the 507lb California state record. Oh well

I ended up winning my weight class which consisted of only two lifters. I beat my competitor by over 100lb though. I got second place for Best Lifter in the Mens Raw Open. Losing that title by a mere 5 points, next time. 

My total was 1, but at the end of the meet I spoke with Mr. Dennison and he gave me my total and my wilks score, which was 394.535. I don't have access to the national lifter rankings so I don't know if I am anywhere near those numbers and the USPA doesn't have lifter classifications at this time. But if I were competing in the RAW federation I would be considered a master level lifter, very near elite.

TL;DR- Won my weight class

I mean, right. Even if there were some miraculous circumstances by which it's 20%, it's misleading to state it like that..because as it turns out, the average is ~2-3%.

[Here is a fantastic rebuttal about some key studies that Kiefer uses in his book](http://forum.bodybuilding.com/showthread.php?t=149292883).

There are many users of this diet out there that claim they are able to achieve the holy grail of losing fat while gaining muscle. It seems to be popular in powerlifting circles (there is a 35 page thread on the bb.com PL forums)

**Got any new pics?**
 
No pictures at the moment I’m afraid.  I am currently bulking and retaining a good deal of water weight
 
**Have you taken up any new activities since your last spotlight?**
 
Eating.  Actually, pretty much everything at this point is High Intensity Interval Training.  At this *moment* I’m not doing cardio since I’m running Smolov for squats and I need to recover my legs as much as possible.
 
**What's been going on since your original spotlight?  Any events or activities you’d like to highlight?**
 
Yes, so I was happy that I could even break it off the floor, ha ha.
 
**What are your current goals?**
 
I wish I knew.  I feel at a loss right now.  I know I’d like to get stronger, and I’ve switched to sumo stance for deadlift, so the immediate goal there is to sumo pull my conventional deadlift PR.   In terms of conditioning, I need to get my rowing started back up again so there will be a lot of 500m pieces in my future I’m sure. 
 
**Has your training changed since last time? What is your current regimen?**
 
Right now I’m running Smolov so my workout schedule is usually squat and bench every other day with OHP thrown in somewhere.  Deadlifts are taking a break.  Probably the biggest change is that I am no longer focusing on my bodyweight as I do not have any meets planned for the rest of the year.  I plan on going by the mirror for the foreseeable future.  My conditioning has taken a back seat to maximal strength but I think in the long run
 
**Has your diet or supplementation changed much?**
 
I’ve reduced my supplementation a good portion.  Now I pretty much just stick to
 
* Multi-vitamin
* Fish oil
* Vitamin D
* Caffeine
 
My diet has lacked the nutritional discipline that would enable me to lift heavier at an ideal bodyweight and bodyfat percentage.  In truth, 2-3 steps back every month.  It’s a cycle that has continued for far too long.
 
**What have you achieved since the last spotlight? What are your ‘numbers’ 
(times, etc)?**
 
I pulled a 450 lbs deadlift on Thanksgiving and unofficially 452 lbs (turned down 2-to-1) at the Arnold Sports Festival (I’m counting it as a +2 lbs *gym* PR).  Additionally
 
**How has your training philosophy
last year?**
 
I was motivated for a very long time about the Arnold Sports Festival Raw Challenge.  After that passed though, I think I psyched myself up so much for the Arnold that I lost sight of a lot of things.  I transformed powerlifting from something that was part of me into my complete identity.  I achieved what I set out to accomplish there (hit raw elite) and now I feel as if there is a large void within me.  I remember reading TheGreatCthulu’s spotlight where he mentioned that after the Channel swimmers complete their swim, depression becomes common.  I know what I achieved is nowhere in the neighborhood of swimming the English Channel, but I think there is some resemblance.
 
Further, lifting, and nutrition.  There are so many “gurus” that are (in my opinion of course) full of shit, people that focus on the dumbest bullshit possible (paralysis by analysis) and gimmicks that are clearly a scam.  For several months now I’ve been contemplating deleting myself from the Reddit/Fitocracy/Bodybuilding.com/etc. communities to focus on myself and really learn from myself without the distraction of the internet.  That extends beyond fitness though.
 
As I alluded to earlier, explore, accomplish, learn, etc.   Some things off the top of my head:
 
* I’ve been meaning to get my skydiving license for about a year now.
* I really would like to get back into camping
* I’ve put it off far too long but I do need to get treated for binge eating disorder as it has affected not just my lifting
* I let powerlifting get in the way of a social life so much that I don’t really have too many local friends to be honest.
* Read books more.  Read anything and everything.  Just read something every day
 
I think I’ve finally reached that “fuck everything” state of mind where I really just don’t care anymore despite what I just mentioned above.   I know it seems paradoxical (don’t care about anything yet want to do so many things) but I believe it is a sign of motivational burn-out.   I think the binge eating plus motivational fatigue and injuries has really created a trifecta to put me in this state of mind and it’ll take a while to get out
 
**What new tricks
 
I’ve really made some good progress with my *sumo* deadlift after this [Q&amp;A with Wild Iron Gym](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWGLcgsUjz4&amp;feature=player_detailpage#t=157s). Also, thereby reducing my ROM by about 0.5”.
 
**Have you had any injuries since last time
 
I’ve been dealing with a shoulder injury (I suspect a shoulder impingement) since late December / early January which has brought my bench down from a 240 touch n’ go to 215 on a good day.  During the course of Smolov so far, extremely dumb mistaken on my part).  I think the shoulder injury is healing up and I’m keeping an eye on the knee and back. 
 
**Have you discovered any new websites/books/DVDs you want to recommend?**
 
I’m running a blog at [CtrlAltLift.Blogspot.com]( http://ctrlaltlift.blogspot.com/).  Aside from that shameless plug

**Age?** 27

**Sex?** M

**What sports or fitness activities are you involved in?** 

Drug free bodybuilding

**Do you compete at any level?**

Professional Natural Bodybuilding for the NGA and IFPA

**What’s your story? When

I always played sports as a kid (basketball, football, etc.) but I ended up I playing golf competitively from at age of 11 all the way through college. I played 4 years for my HS varsity team and then 4 years in college. By the time I finished collegiate golf I was burnt out on the sport. I got tired of being a tall skinny guy so I wanted to devote a lot of my time to weight lifting to try and build a body I was proud of. After a few weeks of 5+ days a week in the gym and seeing some great results from noob gains I was hooked.


**Do you want to share any athletic or fitness-related goals

 Well my goal ever since late July of 2010 was to put on as much lean mass as I could over the course of the next year and a half before I competed again in 2012. I wanted to try and stay at the 11-14% bodyfat range while getting stronger. I’ve managed to go from a stage weight of 192lbs last time I competed to 212.4lbs this morning. I still have visible abs and all my lifts are at personal records so I think I’m on the right track. I hope to hit &gt;215lbs on an am weigh in before beginning my next contest prep at the end of January/beginning of February.


**What is your workout or training regimen?** 

I follow Lyle Mcdonald’s generic bulk template with some minor tweaks to fit my personal physique needs. He suggests a 2x upper/2x lower split per week. His whole premise is strength progression. As you are adding weight to the bar your body is going to grow with you over time. He also keeps everything in the 4-6 rep range for the big compound lifts and then 10-12 reps for the remaining exercises. I’ve seen amazing strength gains while following this routine and also have noticed much more thickness because of it.


**What does your diet look like? Do you take any supplements?** 

I know people will hate me for this answer but my diet right now is anything goes. My main focus is ample protein daily (250g+) and then a caloric surplus (&gt;4K cals) to help put on weight. I have a super fast metabolism so it takes a lot for me to gain weight and usually my appetite dies out before I eat enough to put on size so it’s been a struggle. This has helped me stay fairly lean during this offseason while still putting on good size. I do not suggest this for everyone.


**What have you achieved so far? What are your ‘numbers’ (times, etc)?** 

I won the overall and my NGA pro card at the NGA Natural Mr. California in 2010. I also competed in the 2010 IFPA Pro USA for my professional debut (placed 9th). The IFPA accepts pro cards from all natural organizations so that allowed me to compete with them. I have during this offseason managed to get my big 3 lifts up to 585lbs on deadlifts


**What is your competition and/or training philosophy? What challenges do you face?** 

Like Lyle says, you tend to gravitate towards cleaner foods because they aren’t so calorie dense. I also try to keep lifting heavy when dieting because the heavier weight stimulates more muscle tissue and your body will want to hold onto muscle a lot more if it needs to than if it doesn’t.


**How do you motivate yourself?** 

I think about being on stage and not winning and that motivates me to continue to push it. I hate to lose.

**How do you deal with naysayers and clashes between your lifestyle and that of your SO/friends/co-workers?**

I surround myself with fitness oriented people. Luckily my gf competes as well. She’s an NPC bikini competitor so she’s in the gym more than I am. It helps to have a SO that sympathizes. Over time my friends have weeded themselves out. Ones that could not understand what I do and why I do it just stopped coming around

**What advice do you take

I take evidence-based advice. All other advice I either already know it’s BS or I’ll research it later to find out about it. But something as simple as a suggestion on form/technique in the gym can be tested right there to see if it works the way it’s intended to (ie great muscle activation

**What are some training or diet-related things you know are true but cannot prove?** 

The mind is what limits your potential. If you believe it

**Is there anything that you do differently in your sport/training/diet that you've never seen others do? Any other little innovations you don't mind sharing?** 

I don’t know anyone at my gym that trains upper/lower 2x a week. I only started doing it myself early this year when I got turned onto Lyle’s site (see site url below). Most guys go with the 1 body part per week training method and

**What injuries have you dealt with? What are the injury risks that come with your athletic endeavors?** 

Oh I’ve had plenty of minor injuries but nothing major. I have had plenty of strained muscles, this comes with the territory. When lifting heavy weights for years even with proper form, injuries will occur. That’s the downside to bodybuilding. I haven’t gone one day in several years without something being sore.

**Any advice on how to deal with these injuries and risks?** 

Learn how to properly warm up and then make sure your form is correct on all your lifts. I had to learn these things both the hard way in my early 20s and after correcting them I’ve had many less problems and also seen my strength go up a lot. I wish I would have learned it sooner but I can’t change that

**What are your favorite sports/fitness books/DVDs/websites?** 

I post on bodybuilding.com’s forums a lot for fun and I go to www.bodyrecomposition.com for some great articles. I also read a lot of what Dr. Layne Norton and my coaches at 3D Muscle Journey (www.3dmusclejourney.com) write.

**Anything else you want to add?**

I’ve been a redditor for years and continue to be. I browse the r/fitness section quite a bit and if anyone ever has any questions you can PM me here or on bodybuilding.com (same user name) and I’ll help you out as best I can.

[A couple from last year](http://i.imgur.com/fy8ku.jpg).

[These are from about a month ago](http://i.imgur.com/S1dJo.jpg).

**Age?**

I’ll be 34 next month.

**Sex?**

Male.

**What sports or fitness activities are you involved in? Do you compete at any level?**

Currently the only thing I do is train for competitive powerlifting. My first meet is at the end of the October. Through my teen years and into my mid-20’s I seriously studied (and taught) a martial art known as Kempo. I wrestled in junior high and my freshman year in high school but never took much of an interest in weight training. I hadn’t heard of the word “deadlift” prior to February of this year and might have squatted once in high school.

**What’s your story? When

I’ve been a computer geek my entire life and had the gut to prove it. Even when I was heavily into the marital arts, superhero dad like I remembered my father being. I refused to be the wheezing, fanny-pack wearing slob who couldn't outrun a two year-old. So, with a friend, I joined a Snap Fitness franchise across the street from my office.

Twice a week and then three times a week, my workout buddy told me about the Medifast diet and how it had worked very well for his mother. I looked into it and then placed an order online. It’s a 1000 kcal/day diet of that consists of six soy-based, prepacked meals. Very brutal. Very effective. I strictly adhered to it for six weeks and went from 265 lbs to 235 lbs.

Then one day, but still ate clean and at a deficit. My buddy and I switched to a black iron gym and I’ve been picking up heavy things ever since.

**Do you want to share any athletic or fitness-related goals

I’m eventually going to hold the Michigan USAPL records for both squat and deadlifting. However

**What is your workout or training regimen?**

As the weights got heavier, I’ll explore some other options. I don’t want to switch up this close to a competition.

**What does your diet look like? Do you take any supplements?**

For months I was extremely anal about my diet: weighing everything and counting every calorie. I’ve gradually relaxed a bit but will likely be reverting since I find it easier to put it on autopilot. If I can con my wife into tracking my macros for me
I think only Silverhydra has put more (legal) chemicals in his body than I have here. I’ve experimented with a lot of stuff, choline, B-complex w/ vitamin C, CoQ10, caffeine + yohimbine, zinc, and magnesium. I half-ass take creatine and beta-alanine when I remember. I also grow my own spirulina algae in a spare fish tank.

**What have you achieved so far? What are your ‘numbers’ (times, etc)?**

Since the beginning of the year
My lift PRs are: 

* 420 SQ 
* 255 BP 
* 545 DL
* 190 OHP. 

I plan to attempt a 585 deadlift this Friday or Saturday and then back off it ahead of the meet.

**What is your competition and/or training philosophy? What challenges do you face?**

Biggest challenge is lack of time. I pieced together a home gym via Craiglist a couple months ago after my beloved black iron gym closed it’s doors and auctioned off everything. Being able to head down into the basement now has made this easier. But I run my own, but I think it’s good that it bothers me.

**How do you motivate yourself?**

I’m past the point that I need constant motivation to get my ass in the gym. I like lifting and don’t see that changing; I get pissy and restless if I go more than a few days without it. Knowing that I’m “training” rather than just “working out” is all that I need to keep doing it.

**How do you deal with naysayers and clashes between your lifestyle and that of your SO/friends/co-workers?**

I don’t have any naysayers. The only “challenging person” in my life that affects my training is my five-week daughter who cries more than edubation does about his bench press.

**What advice do you take

I listen to everyone

**What are some training or diet-related things you know are true but cannot prove?**

Preworkout carbs impair my performance. I don’t know why

**Is there anything that you do differently in your sport/training/diet that you've never seen others do? Any other little innovations you don't mind sharing?**

In my basement

**What injuries have you dealt with? What are the injury risks that come with your athletic endeavors?**

Pretty minor stuff, but pulled an adductor doing it. I strained my neck with poor OHP form that resulted in me walking around like Frankenstein’s monster for a week. And I popped something in my back that dropped me to the floor during a DL caused by leaning forward too far on a squat. Nothing that took more than a three weeks to bounce back from though.

As far as my philosophy: I’ve discovered that I have an unusual natural strength in my lower body that’s well-suited to powerlifting. I feel obligated to myself to see how far I can take it. Part of that is accepting ahead of time that I will injure myself at some point, powerlifting largely becomes about who has the highest pain tolerance. I know what I’m getting myself into. I hope.

**Any advice on how to deal with these injuries and risks?**

When I first learned of foam rollers

**What are your favorite sports/fitness books/DVDs/websites?**

I barely have enough time to train, but it wasn’t always the case for me. I’m never going to reach perfection; someone else will always be stronger than me and life will always manage to get in the way of my training. But as long as I keep getting stronger, I’m doing something right. I don’t want my hobby to start to resemble a job too much so I try not to overthink things anymore.

**Anything else you want to add?**

I wish I had some words of wisdom to close this out with. But I’m still earning my stripes and don’t want to presume that what I learned about myself applies to others. Thanks for the invitation to indulge my ego. And I appreciate the advice you’ve all given me along the way.",self,t5_2s9km,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/AdvancedFitness/comments/kmkwi/member_spotlight_chr0me/

**Care to share some pics?**

http://tobeccaagain.imgur.com/member_spotlight_pics

Current pics as well as some from a year or two ago. Hard to take my own picture in arm balances

**Stats?** 

Almost 27, about 20-22% body fat currently.

**What sports or fitness activities are you involved in?**

Yoga! I instruct it 4 to 6 days/week and keep my own practice going as well. I do body weight workouts in HIIT format 3-4 times/week on the days my yoga is not intense. I also teach Boot Camp classes, in no way am I an expert there though. I get addicted to lifting weights when it is convenient, but haven't since May this year when I stopped working at a gym :( When I do I stick to big lifts- squat, dl, bench, c&amp;j, ohp sometimes

**What’s your story? When

I’ve always been active. I was a dancer my whole life, yoga and pilates classes I had done, and the look my body used to have. I got back into teaching dance and fitness, got certified in yoga, blah blah blah. Now teaching yoga classes is my main job. Yoga gave me back my flexibility, agility, and dealt with the knee/ankle issues.

**What are your current fitness-related goals?**

There are an endless number! I’m always focusing on getting better at advanced yoga postures. Long term I want to get back to hiking the Appalachian Trail. I would love to compete in a figure competition in 5ish years. Teaching is my first priority now so that will have to wait.

**Goal Body Weight**

It’s about how I feel/look. I am definitely a “pear” shape, yoga, and my HIIT stuff help to keep it more like a bubble and less like a secretary spread (I hate seeing that on anyone, ugh). I like to have definition in my abs, shoulders, and triceps as well. I fluctuate between 130 and 135, but I wouldn't mind 125ish ;)

**What is your workout or training regimen?**

Vinyasa Yoga one hour or more 5 or 6 days/week

**What does your diet look like? Do you take any supplements?**

Lots of veggies, almonds, and dairy. I fucking love cheese and milk, it’s a problem. If I am feeling weak or training hard (boot camp classes), I take BCAAs before and after workouts. Also as needed, protein powder and – gag - psyllium husk. I splurge once a week on a meal out and a few pints of Guinness!

**What have you achieved so far? What are your ‘numbers’?**

50 or more in GOOD form pushups in a row

**What is your competition and/or training philosophy?**

Patience and practice make your body capable of limitless things. I don’t care what everyone else can do, so I need to do it right. I try to meditate a few minutes or more every day on a different yama or niyama, but I'm only human and this doesn't always happen. 

**How do you deal with naysayers and clashes between your lifestyle and that of your SO/friends/co-workers?**

To most of my friends, parties, and the usual debauchery by choosing yoga workshops or hiking trips over them. It’s hard not to want to share the positive results I’ve had with loved ones… you guys get it. When something works and feels great, you just want to help your fam/friends to feel good too. Some jump on the band wagon, but most don’t.

**What advice do you take

Extremes in anything to me are not great. I do my own research. I only take advice from people that had to work to be able to do the things I want to do. If someone has natural ability, there is always someone that did it first, does it better, or will perfect the art. I try to be a student whenever possible.

**What injuries have you dealt with?**

I have basically fixed my issues through yoga

**Any advice on how to deal with these injuries and risks?**

Take the recovery time you are supposed to- don’t cut it short because it will bite you in the ass later.

**What are your favorite sports/fitness books/DVDs/websites?**

 - 192.5 kg / 424.2 lbs (three white lights)
 - 197.5 kg / 435.2 lbs (three white lights

 - 247.5 kg / 545.5 lbs (three white lights
 - 257.5 kg / 567.5 lbs (three white lights

My flight had 14 or 15 competitors from both the 220 and 242 weight classes.  It was also a mix of open, so I'd be surprised if I held onto it.  567.5 lbs seems pretty ""meh"" for a DL record anyhow.

**Lessons learned**

* *Get some good sleep!*  I went to bed at 9pm

* *Use more than one scale.*  I was concerned that I was going to cut it close to 220 lbs

* *Don't underestimate the adrenaline factor.*  I was originally going to open with a 545 DL but changed it to 500 lbs after I learned that I couldn't attempt anything lighter even if I missed.  If I had stuck with a 545 opener

**Do you want to share any athletic or fitness-related goals

&gt; This year's goal is to make at least a 205kg total in my current category. This will qualify me for next year's English senior championships. 

**What is your workout or training regimen?**

&gt; Mostly prescribed by my Coach. This week was:

&gt; Wednesday:
&gt;
&gt;    Hang Snatch
&gt;    Snatch Pull @ 80% x 5 x 5
&gt;    Front Squat @ 80% x 3 x 6
&gt;    Military Press / Narrow Rows - 8 x 4
&gt;
&gt; Friday:
&gt;    
&gt;    Power Clean and Jerk @ 80% x 3 x 6
&gt;    Power Jerk 1RM
&gt;    Jerk off blocks/stands (must be higher than Power Jerk 1rm) x 1 x 6
&gt;    Back Squat @ 80% 2, 8, 10 ... then die
&gt;
&gt; Saturday:
&gt; 
&gt;    Clean
&gt;    Clean Pull @ 100% x 5
&gt;    ""Abs work"" - I did these things we call hitlers
&gt;
&gt;    I then proceeded to mess about and do some hang snatches just because.
&gt;
&gt; The rest of my week is usually made up of squats and technical work because I'm still working hard on trying to correct the little niggles I have
&gt;
&gt; Monday:
&gt; 
&gt;    Back Squat to failure
&gt;    Snatch pulled about 90% x 5 x 5
&gt;    Hang Cleaned @ 80% of my clean max x 2 x 4
&gt;
&gt; Tuesday:
&gt;
&gt;    Power Jerk 1RM
&gt;    Hang Snatch doubles @ various weights.
&gt;
&gt;I've started pressing and BTN pressing the bar as warmup/cooldown too, I want to see what coach says first if he thinks it's worth the energy being taken away from other stuff.
&gt;
&gt;I also want to get my squat up

**What does your diet look like? Do you take any supplements?**

&gt;I'm only just starting to eat a lot again, ground beef, lots of vegetables such as broccoli, peas, carrots, that kind of thing. I LOVE sweet potato, but try not to go overboard
&gt;
&gt;As for supplements
&gt;
&gt;Fish oil - to aid my joints recovery
&gt;Choline - A recent addition
&gt;Whey Isolate - I'm trying to put lean mass on
&gt;

**What have you achieved so far? What are your 'numbers' (times, etc)?**

&gt;I competed in a regional competition, best Front Squat is 110kg, so far!

**What is your competition and/or training philosophy?**

&gt;Train hard
&gt;
&gt;As I've only competed in this sport once, chill the hell out, and don't worry about how much time you have on the platform, I think are the key things to realise next time.

**What challenges do you face?**

&gt;Convincing myself that putting heavy weights above my head isn't dumb. It's getting easier

**How do you motivate yourself?**

&gt;Seeing my progress over time, I was without a coach for a bit and my lifts were staying the same. I was also feeling pretty tired and run down because I simply wasn't eating enough to train the 5 days a week I like to get in.

**How do you deal with naysayers and clashes between your lifestyle and that of your SO/friends/co-workers?**

&gt;I ignore them. The only people who naysay are those who have no idea what they're talking about. 

**What advice do you take

&gt;I take advice from experienced lifters and professionals. Advice from my coach
&gt;
&gt;I ignore the advice which comes from people who know nothing about my sport or lifting heavy things in general. I've heard the whole ""oh but squatting is bad for your knees"" and other bullshit before

**What are some training or diet-related things you know are true but cannot prove?**

&gt;I don't really know any

**Is there anything that you do differently in your sport/training/diet that you've never seen others do?**

&gt;Not really

**Any other little innovations you don't mind sharing?**

&gt;Foam rolling
&gt;
&gt;[Mobilitywod](http://www.mobilitywod.com/) routines have started to help a lot too

**What injuries have you dealt with? What are the injury risks that come with your athletic endeavours?**

&gt; My shoulders keep getting strained; I just need to make them stronger!

**Any advice on how to deal with these injuries and risks?**

&gt; Rest up and eat well, seek medical help and take their advice. Most of them are helpful and will do what they can to aid you in a speedy recovery back to competition.

**What are your favourite sports/fitness books/DVDs/websites?**

&gt; Greg Everett's weightlifting book is great
&gt;
&gt; He also writes articles for [website](http://www.catalystathletics.com/)
&gt;

As I was getting in the ring I notice that my opponent is 3 inches taller, 30lbs heavier, covered in tattoos, and looked like he was well versed in punching people.(Ah, the days of early MMA) I, at the time, I was just in the gym getting in shape.

Open water swimming. Marathon swimming (&gt; 20k) &amp; I also race Open Water. Surfing &amp; sailing.

I've also been been honoured by being asked to Channel Crew for 3 Soloists in the next two years including redditor **bigattack**

**What is your workout or training regimen?**

**What does your diet look like? Do you take any supplements?**

Just food. Rarely eat fast food &amp; or drink soft drinks. Drink alcohol lightly, the amount of food I ate was .. disconcerting.

Advice: Use coffee sparingly. It's great for endurance athletes if used for maximum effect.

**What is your competition &amp;/or training philosophy?**

~ redacted by TGC ~
* Persevere &amp; your day will come.
* Some people want you to fail. (Tough one to accept)
* Bad days are more important than good days. When The Big Day comes &amp; it's not going well
* Every Channel swimmer's motto: *Nothing Great Is Easy*.
* *Anyone can give up

**What challenges do you face?**

* Cold water. It's NOT a talent
* For me, no lines, no mercy.
* People calling out the Coast Guard  helicopter (really).
* Lactate threshold. You should see what 14 hours swimming &amp; lactic buildup can do to a human.

**How do you motivate yourself?**

Experience &amp; I desire greatly to be better than what I am

*A serious house on serious earth it is

*In whose blent air all our compulsions meet

*Are recognised
- Philip Larkin.

**How do you deal with naysayers &amp; clashes between your lifestyle &amp; that of your SO/friends/co-workers?**

The future Mrs Cthulhu is very supportive because she likes the parties. My local pool has been crap. Most of my best friends now are marathon OW swimmers.

**What advice do you take

* I break Open Water Swimming Rule Number 1 (**Never Swim Alone**) almost every week. I advise strongly aginst doing this. The site now ranks amongst the world's most popular Open Water swimming sites.

* I listen very carefully when anyone comments on a stroke problem or something I could/should do better. I may disregard it based on science or experience but I have no ego when it comes to learning.

**What are some training or diet-related things you know are true but cannot prove?**

There's too much obsession with supplements.

Extravagant ""psyching-up"" is useless and is only ego.

You can achieve almost anything with good food. Lamb's liver ftw.

**Is there anything that you do differently in your sport/training that you've never seen others do?** 

Being a Lone Swimmer

**What injuries have you dealt with? What are the injury risks that come with your athletic endeavors?**

Rotator Cuff &amp; impingement issues.  

Asthma. Hypothermia (most people *imagine* hypo). 

Adhesive Capulitis after the Channel

For Channel swimming: it's dangerous

**Any advice on how to deal with these injuries &amp; risks?**

* Sports massage. I didn't get my 1st until I started swimming. Spent months working on tissue scars from a lifetime throwing myself off stuff. It's the best ongoing thing an athlete can do for their body.

* *Magic Cups*. Freeze water in disposable *polystyrene* cups. Tear off about 2/3 cms &amp; apply directly for about 5 minutes. Keep moving the ice. Repeat as many times as desired. 

* Tennis ball &amp; tights. Simple &amp; effective for myofascial release.

**Age?** 24 **Sex?**  Female

**What sports or fitness activities are you involved in?** None

**Do you compete at any level?** Negative

**What’s your story?** My story is that I got too comfortable with myself

**When, and about a year ago did another ‘cut’ to have surgery. He still amazes me with how quickly and easily he can become shredded. My mother was also very built, with a beautiful figure. Their dedication to their sport, along with all the hard work I now know it takes, is incredible and a very strong motivator for me. I somehow always knew I would end up wanting to compete. The last competition my father did was really appealing to me. 

I was an idiot when I first went to the gym, finally giving resistance training a go. Then I began a modified SS + some hypertrophy. My body was changing, and I was starting to move SOME weight. It felt awesome.

The beginning of this year is when I decided to start competing in body building (figure or bikini). Since then

**Do you want to share any athletic or fitness-related goals, though, the body’s ability to change into something totally different through effort, patience, and time blows my mind. I have personally surprised myself in how strong I have become. Sure, to some other women who are lifting what I lift is nothing, but, it is something I am proud of: the average woman doesn’t squat and/or deadlift

**What is your workout or training regimen?** I jumped on the 5/3/1 train (who hasn’t?) Seriously, and DL. If those two exercises were taken out of my routine, I would not enjoy lifting. 5/3/1 allows me to make gains over a shorter period of time, while still allowing me to do all my accessory BB work. My four day split looks like this: Squat day includes quads, glutes, calves OHP day- delts/tris/bis DL day- back, hammies Bench- I just added this on its own day. I hate benching so badly. I am working on my form. I plan on doing dips/ chins ups/ and cardio eventually when I start my cut. 

**What does your diet look like?** Eat all the things!!!! BULKING. This is what happened: I cut about 10lbs in the beginning of the year and I started to see definition. I was doing well with my diet and hitting my weight loss targets weekly. However, that I needed more muscle because it was quite obvious I had none, especially in my shoulders, back, glutes, and calves. So bulking it is! I’m eating about 130-150g of protein a day and this is the only macro I keep track of at the moment. Other than that I am eating way more carbs than usual. I plan on doing a recomp soon, probably followed by a cut at the very end of the year when I am about 10 weeks out of my comp. I am hiring my coach in September so we will see what she recommends.

**Do you take any supplements?** Besides the standard whey, creatine, choline, and casein protein powder. I just cycled off of white flood..and restarted fasted training so I am now using BCAAs preworkout. 

**What have you achieved so far? What are your ‘numbers’ (times, etc)?**  My last tested 1RM’s were in early February. I have made progress since. My last squat was 160X2, last DL was 175X9, last bench was 85X12,and my last OHP was 60X9. I dropped down to 128lbs from 135/136 at the beginning of the year and was probably around 18% BF. Since then I have been eating everything I am not up to about 141lbs with an obvious increase in muscle mass. 

**What is your competition and/or training philosophy?** Be patient, and keep going. Listen to those who know their shit, brush off the people who hate on you. This stuff takes time. It is so easy to give up, which is why so many people are fat and weak. This has been my moto on life in general: if you want it badly enough, you will achieve it. End of story. People make so many excuses for everything. But if you are unhappy about something, change it.

**What challenges do you face?** I am my worse critic, relaxation, my dog, a social life, gym, and eating properly. 

**How do you motivate yourself?** Realizing how far I have come is what motivates me the most. I did this in a year

**How do you deal with naysayers and clashes between your lifestyle and that of your SO/friends/co-workers?** Naysayers: fuck them. They have no idea and, time requirements, and energy that strength training or BB competitions take. Clashes: you work around them most of the time. I actually changed my entire work schedule to be able to have more time to lift and focus on what I am doing. I went from three twelve hour days a week to four days a week of 8 hours in the evening, allowing more time in the AM for working out and making all my food. I have learned to take anything negative with a grain of salt. 

The people who are important to me will support me. Co workers have probably been the most difficult thing to tolerate though. Being an RN I hear the constant “you’ll kill your kidneys” “you’ll mess up your back” “bulky” blablabla. I used to try to educate these people

**What advice do you take

**What are some training or diet-related things you know are true but cannot prove?** Meh

**Any innovations you don't mind sharing?** If you don’t have a proper reverse hyper machine you can easily make something similar with resistance bands and a bench and/or anything else elevated. People know this already. Drop sets work great for hypertrophy. 

**What injuries have you dealt with? What are the injury risks that come with your athletic endeavors? Any advice on how to deal with these injuries and risks?**

I haven’t had to deal with any major injuries besides minor aches and pains. Listen to your body

**What are your favorite sports/fitness books/DVDs/websites?** [Swolesister.com](http://swolesister.com) has been a very good motivator to me lately. Sorry boys, watching Super_luminal and her progress has also been awesome and motivating. Smoftiebear has always been another lady who motivates me. She is hoping to compete and has kept me going. It is nice to share the annoyances and common issues and passion of competing in BB with those ladies.

**Anything else you want to add?** Thanks to all the intelligent fools who have helped me get where I am

As I've come to expect from Kiefer, really struck a chord with me.  

Over the summer I really ramped up my running.  Nothing spectacular mind you

While I certainly gained some fat following this routine while I was lifting and nothing else

My theory was that because I was doing more work that relied upon fat as the fuel source

So the point of all this...  Does anyone know the specifics of this as it applies to men?  Is there any way around this effect if one truly enjoys running but doesn't want that added fat gain?

**Stats**

 * Age: 28.9 
 * Sex: Male
 * Height: 5'10""
 * Weight: 170

**What sports or fitness activities are you involved in? Do you compete at any level?**

In addition to recreational gymnastics, I know how to properly use a katana - and how to defend against one when empty handed. Come at me, bro.

In the future I plan to do some bouldering and parkour. The wife is interested in parkour

**What’s your story? When

I'm a desk jockey by day, and got in good shape through yoga along with eating right. But I eventually switched jobs and didn't have access to that gym anymore. I got flubby again.

Then I met a girl, quit smoking, and started working out regularly.

My workouts have been very different, sledge hammers, and many other things. The engineer in me loves the Ross Enamait style of making up shit at home to workout with. Eventually, I moved on to more gymnastic style training.

**What are your current athletic or fitness-related goals?**

My goals are all over the board. The goals I'm actively shooting for right now are a 30s freestanding handstand, a proper pistol, and a one-armed chin. The one-armed chin is amazingly close, and I can do a pistol with a heel elevation, but not barefoot...

Long term goals include things like a back handspring, and a hands-backward planche (which is significantly harder than a regular planche)

**What is your workout or training regimen?**

I workout M/W/Sa, focusing on my weaknesses - like hamstrings and wrists.

My workouts are a bit of a hybrid program. They generally look like this:

 * Warmup (Joint Mobility
 * Static Warmup (60s total of static positions
 * Skill Work (I typically do 3x wall handstands here
 * 1 Upper Body
 * Stretching

It's a combination of Building the Gymnastic Body, with the final work following progressions from both CC and BtGB, with the ""2 exercise, max"" concept and other specifics, such as full body tension, from NW.

I don't regularly do direct core work

**What does your diet look like? Do you take any supplements?**

I eat largely paleo, allow for some potatoes or rice.

Supplements: I take a basic multi, and Fish Oil. Every so often I include some calcium, as I have the bottle just sitting there. Additionally, I have recently added psyllium husk in pill form. I also drink approximately 3 scoops of ON Whey per day, in various disbursements.

**What have you achieved so far? What are your ‘numbers’ (times, etc)?**

Hmm, when I do handstand work, I typically will set a timer for X minutes and just freestyle it until the timer goes off. I guess the most impressive things I have are:

 * 5s Half-lay Front Lever
 * ~10s Freestanding Handstand
 * 10-12 Standing Wheel Rollouts
 * 5m27s Plank (tested 3 months ago)

**What is your competition and/or training philosophy?**

To me

Additionally, then don't - there will always be tomorrow. That doesn't mean I don't believe in pushing yourself. I just believe that you should listen to your body more than your motivation.

**What challenges do you face?**

Hanging gymnastic rings in a rented apartment is near impossible. Hanging them from a doorway pullup bar is a poor substitute.

I also have terrible wrist flexibility

**How do you motivate yourself?**

I just want to be a badass. Martial arts, deep down, part of me wants my future children to think their father is a badass, too.

**How do you deal with naysayers and clashes between your lifestyle and that of your SO/friends/co-workers?**

I don't really have this problem. I don't publicly talk about my lifestyle really, I just smile and nod

**What advice do you take

I take a lot of advice related to visualization during certain movements. I always find them useful - ""pinch a coin"" or ""push the chest up"".

I tend to ignore a lot of hyper-specific supplement advice. You know the kind: ""Take 3.75g of Xotine Z-Plus 25 minutes before a workout

**What are some training or diet-related things you know are true but cannot prove?**

Anything that is 0 calories and not water is bad for you - don't consume it. The spine is meant to bend

Balance is a skill like any other, etc) are diet related

**Is there anything that you do differently in your sport/training/diet that you've never seen others do? Any other little innovations you don't mind sharing?**

I don't think anything I do is unique

I love isometrics as a warmup - I find they actually improve my performance (assuming your don't go all out on the isometrics).

My secret weapon is dessicated liver tabs and green tea before a workout. It's likely just the B12 in there

**What injuries have you dealt with? What are the injury risks that come with your athletic endeavors?**

Due to my ""listen to your body"" philosophy

I have run into a mild case of the ""golfer's elbow"" tendinitis when I overdid it one day with inverted rows

**Any advice on how to deal with these injuries and risks?**

Learn how to break-fall and protect your boney parts...

Also

**What are your favorite sports/fitness books/DVDs/websites?**

Ross Enamait is my hero. He's a fighter, I really respect Pavel Tsatsouline, Scott Sonnon, and Christoper Sommer.

**Anything else you want to add?**

As [edubation](http://www.reddit.com/r/AdvancedFitness/comments/gtf82/member_spotlight_edubation/) said in his spotlight - I also have an inferiority complex. I feel like everyone and their mother in these parts are stronger than me. I'm completely ok with that

**Got any new pics?**

   [This is basically my latest state](http://i.imgur.com/XbzdS.jpg?). Taken two weeks ago. Still 20%+ BF and ~230lbs. I'm using this as my 'before' for fatloss/weightloss

**Have you taken up any new activities since your last spotlight?**

   Not too much

**Have you competed since last time? How did that go?**

Yes! Twice. Here are the meet reports and vids:

* [NJ States Meet Report and Video](http://www.reddit.com/r/AdvancedFitness/comments/j05yp/my_experience_at_the_nj_state_bench_press/)
* [Meet Report - 2011 USAPL Raw Nationals](http://www.reddit.com/r/AdvancedFitness/comments/jqp9p/meet_report_2011_usapl_raw_nationals_or_how_i/)
* [Video - 2011 USAPL Raw Nationals](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtxbSJVAaZ8)

It was such a great feeling to compete in something again. The worst feeling athletically in my life was the last time I walked off the field/court in H.S. and knew I would never play again in front of crowds in that way. This is such a great feeling to be able to get back out there and perform even if I'm not the best *(or tenth best)*

**What's been going on since your original spotlight?**

I quit my gym! I built out my weight training set in the basement over a 5 month period. I miss some of the equipment form the gym

[I started with a Craigslist special for $100 that included bar, so bought an extra set of plates about a month later as well as draping my two 20kg Kettlebells over the end for DLs as needed and I had 476lbs to train with even if wonky.

I basically did deadlifts

[In late January I got a squat rack finally](http://www.newyorkbarbells.com/pro93140.html) so I picked those up again. There is an intriguing situation going on with these *(see below)*

March saw a bench added and then at the begging of April I got my piece de resistance: A Texas Power Bar!

* [Pic 1](http://i.imgur.com/HzKz0.jpg)
* [Pic 2](http://i.imgur.com/x0nb0.jpg)

It is heaven and I immediately did a self meet to try it out. More on that in achievements section.

**What are your current goals?**

I'm really conflicted at the moment. Lifting heavy stuff is so addicting

Short Term (3-5 months): Lose weight even if it's at the cost of some strength. I want to be around 200lbs and ~13-15% BF. I wouldn't mind even going lower

Long Term: Rely on muscle and CNS memory to get back any lost strength while maintaining weight. Eventual goals are 400lb Bench

**Has your training changed since last time? What is your current regimen?**

I'm still kind of dicking around since I was for so long with out the bench and rack. The last few weeks I've kind of settled on the following schedule:

* M: Bench/Rows or KBs
* T: Off due to life schedule
* W: Squats
* Th: Misc
* F: Bench/Rows or KBs
* Sat or Sun: Deadlifts or KBs
* Sun or Sat: Plyometrics/Rock/Sprints

Being a busy person

The one main thing I have changed technically is that I switched to low bar squats and I'm rocking the fuck out of them *(more intriguingness)*.

**How has your training philosophy

Mostly my philosophy has become: ""Lift every rep like you will in a meet"". It's simple but it helps me focus and I'm seeing progress.

That

**What new tricks

* Pausing! *(bench and squats)*

I had taken 6 months off bench press with maybe 5-6 total session of floor press. When I got my bench

Also

**What is this intriguing situation with squats?**

[Here is the graph of my squats workouts](http://i.imgur.com/EWnfr.jpg) since I got my rack. My last squat before Jan 25th this year was Aug 23rd 2011 at Raw Nationals where I set a PR of 369lbs. As noted above

Got my rack and decided to see if I could still hit 300. \o/ So took a couple workouts to get my grove back and decided to try to PR and got it. I felt I had more. Another two workouts later try again for more. Got it. I knew I had 400 in me. The next week I did: 401lbs. Confidence is sky high. Decided to switch to lowbar and on my second workout with lowbar attempted and failed 403lbs

I spent a couple sessions starting 5/3/1 and doing above bodyweight widowmakers for accessory while cracking down my lowbar form and that's when my TPB came. Self meet time: 405lbs!. I knew I had more in me.

This past Sunday was my Mom's and shortkid422's birthday so I thought it would be fun to hit 422 on 4/22. Got it. 

So after being off squats for 5 months completely

I not taking creatine or whey

I know I have more in me....

**What have you achieved since the last spotlight? What are your ‘numbers’ (times, etc)?**

Numbers from the previous spotlight:

* M
* 90 lb DB Turkish Get-up -&gt; **110lb DB TGU**
* 275x3x5 squat but my only actual 1RM max after that was 285 -&gt; [**422lbs Squat**](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1NdX99fh7k)
* 375lb Deadlift (no belt or chalk) -&gt; **435lbs Deadlift**

* 150lbx6 OHP -&gt; **[180lb OHP](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWi39a9gRjE)**

New things

* Edubenchin challenge of 185lbs x 22 on bench.
* 100 snatches in 4:51 [with a 24kg/53lb kettlebell](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2VTraiSK04)
* 207 snatches in 10:00 with a 20kg/44lb kettlebell
* Self meet: [405/295/435](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldayYlAYfJ0) in approx 1.5 hours where I set two PRs
* Total now: 1153lbs

**Any new injuries or recovered from any?**

I may or may not have borked my left shoulder failing a 120lb TGU about a month ago but that remains to be certain. But the biggest thing I wanted to mention is that as of about 2 months after my last MemberSpotlight I am *no longer experiencing chronic back pain!*

I attribute this to deads and squats and taking about 6 months to get my back strong. Sure it still aches sometimes and gets fatigued a little too soon for my liking

1330466856.0,qaauo,Member Spotlight - AdmiralVonBroheim,MemberSpotlight,50,16,55,"**Age? Sex?**

20 years old

**What sports or fitness activities are you involved in?**

I am a competitve powerlifter and judge in the USAPL (United States Powerlifting)

**Do you compete at any level?**

Yes at the State and National level

**What’s your story? When

I got into powerlifting shortly after I graduated high school (2009), never pursuing it because of football and the fact that my school did not have the sport available. 

I competed in my first meet November 2009 and posted a 340 lb Raw bench ( no supportive equipment) at 260-ish lbs. It has been non stop since. The reason I powerlift is because it is a childhood dream of mine, compete, or practice this sport is a dream come true. 

To me powerlifting is more than a sport, the being that lies inside all of us but remains dormant for most their entire lives. This sport teaches me how to unleash myself at will, and how to access energy and power at my command. It is a much a mental development as it is physical, I value both greatly and I learn something about myself almost every day. The lessons I learn translate into the real world better than anything I have ever been taught in school.

Commitment to excellence, student, friend, and son, but most of all a better human.

**Do you want to share any athletic or fitness-related goals

A 600 lb bench press is my main focus right now, training is going good and I am on the verge of 600.

I have a state record to my name

**What is your workout or training regimen?**

I use something called the bell powercycle. It is the training program created by my world champion coach and has been very successful over many years for many different kinds of lifters.
For my bench press however I do utilize a new program came up with by myself and a training partner of mine

**What does your diet look like? Do you take any supplements?**

My diet now is rough, an apple and a lot of nuts for lunch/dinner. and eat a huge deli sandwitch one whole grain bread. it is typically way over 35g of protein and i have no idea how many carbs.

I drink A LOT OF MILK, so keeping them healthy is important! What I do like to use when I can afford it is con-cret. best supplement I have ever used!

**What have you achieved so far? What are your ‘numbers’ (times, etc)?**

I stand 6 foot 5 inches tall, 31"" legs and 62"" shoulders. My best total is 1470-ish, with a token squat and deadlift. ( I'm a bencher after all) however I have recently gotten into a squat suit and should squat close to 600 and put up a decent total!

**What is your competition and/or training philosophy?**

You compete like you train, pick up something heavy. Pay for it now, don't buy it later.

**What challenges do you face?**
Overcoming my injury. Most people with a herniated disk in their spine never do much of anything after it happens

**How do you motivate yourself?**
Music is one way I motivate myself, it motivates me to stick to my goals and to my morals and make the right choices.

The conversations I have with myself are really what get me going, the burning desire I have deep down.

**How do you deal with naysayers and clashes between your lifestyle and that of your SO/friends/co-workers?**

Simple, especially not being the best one, I have a support system that a lot of top lifters do not have, and for that I am grateful.

**What advice do you take

I have had many conversations with some of the best lifters on earth. What I have learned is that not one single person has all the answers

People never give me advice

**What are some training or diet-related things you know are true but cannot prove?**

The body CAN absorb more than 20-30g of protein at a time.

**Is there anything that you do differently in your sport/training/diet that you've never seen others do?**

Not that I can think of off the top of my head... there are some extremes in powerlifting

**Any other little innovations you don't mind sharing?**

Board presses are key to a big bench press, as are your shoulders. But whenever I work with a lifter, I add to their tricep and back load/intensity and they always perform better on the bench.

Also a set up and incorporating leg drive are vital to a big bench.

**What injuries have you dealt with? What are the injury risks that come with your athletic endeavors?**

Aas stated before my lumbar spine injury which I still deal with today. There are plenty of injury risks including but not limited to: concussion, broken bones, torn muscles/ligaments, cuts/bruises.

**Any advice on how to deal with these injuries and risks?**

TRAIN SMART. listen to your body and let it recover when it tells you it needs to. RICE- rest ice compress elevate.

**What are your favorite sports/fitness books/DVDs/websites?**

My favorite sports to watch are -football, strongman, throwing.

1322987853.0,mzll1,"[Meet Report] 2011 IPL World Championships in Las Vegas, Nevada (crosspost from r/powerlifting)",failon,39,4,http://www.reddit.com/r/AdvancedFitness/comments/mzll1/meet_report_2011_ipl_world_championships_in_las/

My preparation for the meet involved acknowledging my inner HAES (moving from the 242 class to the 275's) and following Tim Henriques' deadlift program in the hopes of getting my 540 competition pull up to 600. I followed the program pretty much to the letter, abandoning it after a week and a half when my biceps tendons blew up. The volume greatly improved my form and confidence, though, so it wasn't a total bust. After that, I benched twice a week working up to a 3rm one day, 3x5 the other day, both followed by incline work varying the grip for chest or triceps depending on how I felt.

As Thanksgiving rolled around, as I had to work Thursday and couldn't make the drive fast enough to hit the evening weigh-ins). A couple hours out from Vegas, Steve Denison (meet director and federation chair) calls me and tells me to haul butt in there so he doesn't have to get up early to weigh me and inspect my gear. We check into the hotel around 10:30 and I head down to the ballroom to meet the scale. I came in at 266, demonstrating my utter ineptitude at bloating.

Anyway, consume 4 grams of choline (because the diarrhea had yet to rear its watery head) and mix another 10 grams with my gatorade. Breakfast consisted of 8 or 9 star crunches, a 5 hour energy shot, and a bronkaid, leaving me plenty of time to get to the ballroom to warm up at 8:30. (Insert description of massive pre-squat dump.)


**Squat**

Warm up went as follows.

* Rumble roller, jumps

* Stare at all the monsters and wonder how badly I'm going to get crushed

* Stand awkwardly next to the ER Rack and wonder how to adjust the rack height

* Make friends with a kid from Hawaii who knows how to adjust the rack and start squatting

* 135x6ish, 415x1 (I wasn't really counting)

My opening attempt on squats was 425. Easy weight

Next was 474

Last squat was 500 for a big PR and 25 pounds more than I've ever attempted. It felt light and moved fast

My brother was in the next flight and went 3 for 3

**Bench**

Bench warmups were next. I honestly don't remember what I did here aside from popping another bronkaid and washing it down with another 5 hour energy. Might have eaten a sandwich at some point. I do remember that my shoulder was feeling good

Bench opener was 257 for an easy 3 whites. Second attempt was 286 for a 45 pound meet PR. Smoked it and called for 308. Got the weight a couple inches off my chest after playing a couple rounds of Civ IV as I waited for the press command. Shoulder said nope! and shut down. No pain

My brother went 3 for 3 again in the next flight and broke a long-standing barrier with a 352 bench.

**Deadlift**

Deadlift warmups involved refreshing myself in a bath of liniment

Opening deadlift was 507. Dang thing flew up and about knocked me over. 2 whites because my right sock wasn't pulled up as high as my left.

Next pull was 573 for a 33 pound meet PR. Came up easier than the first

I called for 601 for my last lift of the meet and a huge PR. This attempt was the culmination of all my work since August and a weight I wanted to hit before the end of the year. It came up, so I'm quite pleased with it.

My brother finished the meet 9 for 9 and pulling 650 for a 1569 total in the 308's. We each ended up taking 3rd in our weight classes and we hope to return to the Rocky Mountain Regionals next year.

That kid from Hawaii took 2nd in my weight class with a stupidly high squat and bench. Shawn Bellon spanked us both

All in all

Other highlights:

* Hanging out between attempts

* Sitting directly behind the right side judge when Chad Smith dropped his 837 pound squat attempt. Had a really good view of that mess. Not sure why there was only one scrawny spotter on each side

* No diarrhea.

**Age:** 24

**Sex:** M

**What sports or fitness activities are you involved in? Do you compete at any level?**

My main activity is lifting for the sake of lifting. I have competed in two low-level strongman competitions, volleyball softball.

**What’s your story? When

I am naturally a terrible athlete, to get stronger. I really, really enjoyed getting stronger so I kept it up, and started taking it more seriously. In 2007 I started squatting and deadlifting seriously and competed in my first strongman competition.

**Do you want to share any athletic or fitness-related goals
**
My recent success is that I lost a crapload of weight while staying almost as strong. At the end of last year I deadlifted 500 pounds and decided I was strong enough for the time being

**What is your workout or training regimen?**

My training basically involves doing full body workouts of whatever I feel like. I'll start with a full body movement like squats or deadlifts or cleans and work my way up to some sets of three, and then finish up with some bodyweight exercises.

**What does your diet look like? Do you take any supplements?**

My diet basically involves eating meatstuffs and vegetables. I hardboil and peel 18 eggs at a time, some steamed vegetables (usually brocolli), flavour, and recently quinoa as filler. Occasionally I'll make a nutrient rich slop where I boil a cup of quinoa, a cup of beans, and a cup of lentils and store it in a big tupperwear and add it to my meals accordingly. It lasts about a week. In the past I've taken protein shakes but I'm not really a big supplement user. I prefer food.

**What have you achieved so far? What are your ‘numbers’ (times, etc)?**


My personal records are approximately 
* 505 deadlift 
* 409 squat 
* 300 bench 
* 230 push press 
* 242 clean. 

I say approximately because the bars at my current gym vary in weight.

**What is your competition and/or training philosophy? What challenges do you face?**

I don't have much of a philosophy beyond the stuff you'll read on any lifting forum. One thing I do is that I like to always set some sort of personal record when I train. Sometimes when I have a goal in mind and I fail

**How do you motivate yourself?**

I genuinely enjoy going to the gym and it's pretty much a habit for the past several years. I don't need to motivate myself further. When I'm going for a heavy lift I try to justify to myself why I should be able to do it (""I did three reps with ten less pounds

**How do you deal with naysayers and clashes between your lifestyle and that of your SO/friends/co-workers?**

I don't really encounter naysayers. I work at/attend a university so the gym is always nearby.

**What advice do you take

Sadly

**What are some training or diet-related things you know are true but cannot prove?**

I'll sleep on this one (about things I cannot prove).

**Is there anything that you do differently in your sport/training/diet that you've never seen others do? Any other little innovations you don't mind sharing?**

I don't follow a set program

**What injuries have you dealt with? What are the injury risks that come with your athletic endeavors?**

Fortunately I've never been hurt badly enough to see a doctor about it. I think a lot of elite strength athletes are predisposed to durability as well as strength. I've pulled some intercostal rib muscles. I've had some twinges in my back that go away after a while

**Any advice on how to deal with these injuries and risks?**

My advice to avoid this is to not do explicitly stupid things, and respect the weights instead of treating them like toys.

**What are your favorite sports/fitness books/DVDs/websites?**

I learned most of my iron knowledge on the Sherdog Strength and Power forum (now Strength and Conditioning). That was a great forum which I sadly don't post much in these days. An organization that spun off from it, then post a video of yourself doing something awesome in the shirt. There was a guy who was battling Crohn's disease who posted a video of him overhead squatting his own weight, and another guy who was some sort of Viking badass hammering a hot iron spike until it folded over in only like eleven hammers.

*****

**The Program:**

I followed it to a tee. No upper body pressing for three weeks other than the benching. I even managed to hit a squat PR at the start of week two (320x1). 

I found it to be pretty easy on Mondays, light touch on the chest, tightening the back). 

I did heavy upper-body pulling on Wednesdays and Fridays (weighted pull-ups

*****

**The Diet:**

3, 4,000-4,500 calories on workout days. Fat around 100 grams, protein 230-260 grams, carbohydrates filling the rest of the calories. I was also fasting for 16 hours every day (Leangains bulking). 

**Weight:**

*Before:* 196lbs (89kg) 
*After:* 200lbs (91kg)

*****

**Results:**

*Bench previous:* 210x1

*Bench now:* 230x1 (possibly 235 if I wasn't testing PRs for every 5lbs - it felt light but my stabilizers were a bit exhausted)

That's a 10% gain for somebody with an incredibly stubborn chest.

**Recommended:**

Yes.

[Let's] get right to it. I'm actually in the midst of getting all cut up for the beach, probably because it was embarrassing. [But here's one from 2006](http://edge.imgur.com/f4TdU.jpg) when I was in college. I started lifting in the summer of 2008. I'm about 6' tall, and bodyweight was probably around 145-150 [then]. Fast forward 2.5 years of training, and here are some pictures from the [end of December, 2010](http://edge.imgur.com/n7Rbs.jpg). Bodyweight was 200 here. Then in 2011 I started training/eating a little more like a bodybuilder. [Here](http://edge.imgur.com/FhE5a.jpg) are some [recent pictures](http://edge.imgur.com/MaHDS.jpg) at a bodyweight of 181.

**Age &amp; Sex?**
26

**What sports or fitness activities are you involved in? Do you compete?**

I'm pretty much just a recreational lifter. Awhile back I signed up for a strongman competition at the community center where I used to train

**What’s your story? When

I was always skinny growing up. I played soccer from childhood until high school, and computers. I remember trying to pick up lifting a couple of times in high school, but having no clue what I was doing – I'd spend a couple of weeks messing around aimlessly with machines and isolation stuff, then quit when I saw that I wasn't getting anywhere. The idea of doing a squat or deadlift never crossed my mind. I thought I was just a skinny dude and there was no changing that. I was always a smart, nerdy kid, and I tended to think of myself as an artist and an intellectual whose physical presence was merely incidental. I had the idea that some people were naturally athletic and others weren't, and the concept of becoming strong or improving myself physically didn't really register with me. Then at age 23 I found myself out of college, and totally inactive. I was reading on the internet and something clicked in my head and I realized that if other people could make themselves big and strong I could do it too. I decided it was time to start doing something with my body. I read all about strength training on the stronglifts site and it sounded like a good project

**What are your current athletic or fitness-related goals?**

Right now I'm focused on getting lean while maintaining as much muscle/strength as possible. I spent 2.5 years getting strong and gaining weight and reached most of my former long-term goals

**What is your workout or training regimen?**

Right now I'm training using the “powerbuilding” ideas I've gotten from John Sheaffer of [strengthvillain](http://www.strengthvillain.com). Since I've been losing weight my absolute strength has taken a hit pretty much across the board, where A and B each have 3 different pressing variants and pulling variants. I've been doing rest-pause sets for all of my pressing work, where I do a set to failure, wait for about 45 seconds, pick it up and go to failure again, and then repeat that one more time.

**What does your diet look like? Do you take any supplements?**

I start and end every day with a protein shake. In the morning it's skim milk, protein, and oats if it's a training day. Before bed it's just protein in water. In between I eat a lot of eggs, rice, fish, chicken, and vegetables. I eat steak and ground beef occasionally but less now that I'm leaning out. After workouts I have a shake with 3 parts waxy maize to 1 part protein. I take creatine daily, and a multivitamin. I recently started taking Jack3d pre-workout.

**What have you achieved so far? What are your *numbers*?**

My highest absolute numbers were hit at a bodyweight of around 196.  

* squatted 395x5 
* DLed 485x5. 

My best singles were 

 * 405 squat 
 * 525 DL 
 * 200 press
 * 250 bench 

A few days ago when I got down to 180 bodyweight I tested myself &amp; hit an easy 385 squat and 180 press.

**How do you motivate yourself?**

It's a struggle sometimes. It was definitely easier when I was first starting out and the gains were steady. Now I have to fight a lot harder for them. I was also single then, and I look better than ever, but in a way motivation was a little more straightforward back then. But I'm pretty good at setting a goal and pursuing it until I get there. The internet is good for motivation, too – I can always read or watch videos or look at pictures of someone better than me. And I take pictures and look in the mirror and get motivated to improve. It's a fine line to walk though, because it's easy to get overly self-critical and feel like you're never good enough.

**How do you deal with naysayers and clashes between your lifestyle and that of your SO/friends/co-workers?**

I've been pretty fortunate to not have dealt with too much of this. I taught my girlfriend to lift after we'd been dating for a little while, presses, and pulls the same as I do. When I was gaining weight my family would tell me that I was fat, which was annoying, but I knew exactly what I was doing to reach my goals, so it didn't bother me. None of my friends really understand or relate at all to what I do, which is kind of a shame because I wish I had more people to talk to about it

**What advice do you take

I'm always working on honing my bullshit detector, so I'm not the type to always be trying out every new tidbit that I heard. I've got my whole life to train, and while I've played around with a few different approaches at this point, I'm in no big hurry to try out every idea that's out there.

**What are some training or diet-related things you know are true but cannot prove?**

I believe that most people's quality of life would be improved by getting stronger

**Is there anything that you do differently in your sport/training/diet that you've never seen others do? Any other little innovations you don't mind sharing?**

I'd say I've most of what I do is pretty tried and true. But one thing I'm pretty good at is getting amped up before a big lift. I read some research once about how when people are made to move their face muscles like they are smiling, or like I'm going to get into a fight. I grimace, flare my nostrils, clench my fists, and take deep breaths. I tend to find that my body will respond with a fight-or-flight type response, and any fear I have of a PR set will often be subsumed by that reaction.

**What injuries have you dealt with? What are the injury risks that come with your athletic endeavors?**

I've been lucky or smart enough to not have dealt with any significant injuries yet. But I've dealt with a couple bouts of some type of chronic inflammation that were difficult. Back when I first started training I used to get pain on the outside of my hip when I squatted. Some days I could train through it

**Any advice on how to deal with these injuries and risks?**

I think it's best to train through it whenever you can. I kept training through all of the above and they all just went away eventually. I rolled the painful spots with a tennis ball

**What are your favorite sports/fitness books/DVDs/websites?**

Folks who have seen a lot of my comments probably know that I'm a big fan of Rippetoe. I especially appreciate his precise mechanical analyses of the lifts and explanations of the anatomy involved, and generous guy, and he's helped me broaden my horizons a lot.

[Here](http://i.imgur.com/E77Xh.jpg) is the completed sled. [This](http://i.imgur.com/qosdt.jpg) is a teammate pushing it

Giving instructions is going to be somewhat difficult as I was unable to take pictures of the sled while I was building it. I can, so that'll be more information than I had going in to it. The sled is 3 feet long, 2 feet wide, and weighs about 60 pounds empty. The handles are 18 inches tall. Here's the list--

9' 4x4

8' 2x4

2x3 board

12 square drive multipurpose screws

12 4"" lag screws

1 big ass eye bolt

2 threaded pipes (18"" tall

2 threaded pipe bases to match pipe size

8 1.75"" screws for the pipe bases.

Thick carabiner

Harness (sold separately

[Sled without pipes attached](http://i.imgur.com/OHg3j.jpg)

[Threaded pipe base close-up](http://i.imgur.com/xO0DS.jpg)

[Sled front and eye bolt](http://i.imgur.com/tgKhU.jpg)

[Completed

You'll notice a shitload of dry Gorilla Glue on the front of the sled. I originally had larger non-threaded pipes and thought I could ream out the 4x4 and sink them in to the runners and then bolt that through

Make sure you cut your runners evenly and always double check to make sure the back of the sled is the back and the front is the front. The eye bolt side is the front and the runners are cut up on that side. It makes a difference. 

Drill the 2x4 ""rims"" onto the 2x3 base before you attach the base to the 4x4 runners. Use the wood screws and drill from the bottom of the 2x3 base into the 2x4 rims. (shitty wording

I'll answer questions to help clarify. I am clearly not an architect, but I'll do my best to alleviate confusion.

What

**Age?** 24 **Sex?** Male

**What sports or fitness activities are you involved in? Do you compete at any level?**

Climbing, routesetting.

**What’s your story? When

Before climbing I was sedentary for about six years. A friend took me to the climbing gym and it caught me pretty hard. Everything changed overnight. Climbing became the reason to watch my diet, it was a crazy transformation.

**Do you want to share any athletic or fitness-related goals

I'm very focused on climbing new problems (first ascents) at my limit. Lots of guesswork, long drives, self-doubt, giving up, driving home, driving back next weekend, last-second-fading-sun glory. Every plateau is a bit bigger. I did recently finish off one big project

I couldn't do 1-5-8s on the rungs in February and now I can. So now I'm working on 1-5-9. I recently became able to one arm deadhang the smallest edge on my fingerboard for a few seconds.

I'd like to be able to do OAPs on rings - right now I can just barely do them. On a perfect jug ledge. At the very beginning of a session. After a rest day. Heh.

**What is your workout or training regimen?**

During climbing season, dry weather. I climb or train at least five days a week. As far as specific training, I do one or two periodized training sets during winter. 

Summer is more random:

* Wednesday 7/6: light routesetting day, pullovers, and shoulder stability stuff. I have lots of compression projects right now. 

* Thursday 7/7: Core work in the AM

* Friday 7/8: My bouldering circuit at the local crag (about 30 problems V5-8)

* Saturday 7/9: Campus in the AM (4x 1-3-5-7-9-88-77-66-55-44-33-22-11, cool down by campusing easy problems), rest for the day. 

* Sunday 7/10: Climbing outside with some friends. 9 pitches between 10c and 12c. More or less another rest day. 

* Monday 7/11: ~4 hours of gym bouldering

* Tuesday 7/12: Rest - bike ride and yoga

Pretty disorganized, and about 1 hour a day of ""cleanup"" work - myofascial release, various physical therapy for injury recovery, stretching, contrast therapy for fingers, etc.

**What does your diet look like? Do you take any supplements?**

I eat lots of meat, but I also eat whatever my body craves. So there are days where I drink a mocha and eat a muffin for breakfast, and I'm cool with that. I think supplements are completely bogus or at the very least unnecessary for climbing. It's a movement sport - more technical than physical. Recovery meals or protein shakes make a huge difference in my recovery turnaround for max performance though. The best plan is the one you'll follow, so why bother forcing yourself to eat ""zone"" or some such garbage? Just eat a diet that sustains your performance, that you are cool with eating for the rest of your life, and doesn't completely ostracize you from every social gathering.

**What have you achieved so far? What are your ‘numbers’ (times, etc)?**

I hate grades and spray

**What is your competition and/or training philosophy? What challenges do you face?**

Climbing is movement, and the rest movement practice, the more the better.
I don't have near as much power as most of the people who climb my grade

**How do you motivate yourself?**

Bouldering is meditation, a social life, a puzzle and an adventure all in one. A better question would be ""how do you motivate yourself to make time for anything else?""
I struggle with hard gym sessions sometimes, it kills you. A man must constantly exceed his level.""

And if you've ever climbed any of the hard problems Gill put up in the 70s wearing high-top boots and socks

**How do you deal with naysayers and clashes between your lifestyle and that of your SO/friends/co-workers?**

My SO climbs, I'm driving 7 hours to try a project and sleeping in my car. It's not for everyone.
Like any other athlete, I get to unwind a little.

**What advice do you take

I take everything with a grain of salt. A lot of climbers at my level are just unbelievably strong and will often say things like ""you aren't trying hard enough, you can etch everything she says in stone.

I ignore the commercialized fitness machine - GNC, anything with the words ""get ripped"" in it. It's all advertising. Strength is function. There are millions of people with 8 pack abs, but there is no vitamin, chemical or pill that will make them climb v12. That takes drive, focus and a metric shitload of work.

**What are some training or diet-related things you know are true but cannot prove?**

Diet is placebo. If you eat something you think is working

**Is there anything that you do differently in your sport/training/diet that you've never seen others do? Any other little innovations you don't mind sharing?**

It's not different

I micromanage my shoes and skin. A lot.

Less is more when you start. Hold back a bit and you'll progress faster.

**What injuries have you dealt with? What are the injury risks that come with your athletic endeavors?**

Strained pulleys in every finger. Flexor tendon sprain. I tore my ulnar collateral ligament and broke my thumb in two places sticking a dyno in a competition. Stress fractured my toes from repeated falls in tight shoes. I'm lucky compared to my peers.

My current project has a juggy ""keyhole"" two finger pocket where you can lock your thumb and two fingers in. You're wide open on a bad sloper with your other hand and you release tension violently to catch another pocket. The keyhole is on the lip of this roof so you can barely reach it from the ground. If your feet come off and your fingers don't come out of that pocket it's terrifying, fingers are locked in the jug pocket, and you exhale and go ""holy shit,"" take them out, and make sure everything is intact and take a breath and do it again. But it's exhilarating too, if that loop wasn't there the problem might not even be possible.

**Any advice on how to deal with these injuries and risks?**

The most important part of improving at sport is not getting hurt. So get good spotters and get good at it yourself. Respect your gear

Big believer in recovery training for climbing - easy laps where you're just barely working. Flushes the muscles and keeps your joints, biking, swimming, running.. anything that uses different muscle groups.

**What are your favorite sports/fitness books/DVDs/websites?**

Performance Rock Climbing is the bible. Rock Warrior's Way is also good. I love Dave MacLeod's training blog/book, they're great for rest days or getting psyched. Between the Trees and Better than Chocolate are probably my favorites.

I also don't have any good physique pictures because I don't own a camera

**Age?** 

23 

**Sex?** 

Male. 

**What sports or fitness activities are you involved in? Do you compete at any level?** 

In addition to maintaining “outstanding” fitness scores in Navy PFAs, but I'm pretty damn good. I don't enjoy an easy win, so I compete either in a heavier weight class or at better shows to keep me motivated. 

**What’s your story? When

I wrestled in high school as a way to manage my ADD, but none of my family realized I had won, because I had been physically mauled by a much stronger opponent. I realized that I had been relying entirely on my conditioning and technique, and that I was losing to guys that didn't deserve to beat me because I was weak. I started lifting, and when I was a college freshman, I met Jared, a lifelong friend and lifting partner. I was pressured into my first competition just 11 months after starting lifting

**Do you want to share any athletic or fitness-related goals

Hmmm. Right now, I'm proud of that because I hate running. I'd like to pull 500 again by August, we'll see what happens. Squatting 500 by September isn't out of the question. 

**What is your workout or training regimen?** 

Right now it's Chad Smith's Juggernaut training with sprints and PT worked in Photosregularly. I do the “speed and power” option because it suits my competition strengths. I also firmly believe that increasing work capacity and power expression is the fastest way to develop the ability to get stronger. Notice I didn't say “to get stronger” but rather to develop the ability

**What does your diet look like? Do you take any supplements?** 

Intermittent Fasting. Typically fasted morning cardio 3x a week (PT, so just some BCAAs and caffeine for breakfast. I eat big after workouts, and not so big other than that. Nothing secret, just veggies, meat, and lots of milk.

**What have you achieved so far? What are your ‘numbers’ (times, etc)?** 

 - Push Press: 250x11 in competition 

 - Circus DB Press: 180lbs

 - Deadlift: 505x4

 - Squat: 440 in a belt. Just did 265 for 20 no belt

 - Atlas Stone: 330lb stone to 48” box 

Nothing else to note. I'm not that strong

**What is your competition and/or training philosophy?** 

Westside. I got to train at Westside Barbell a couple years ago and it changed the way I look at strength. Speed work is incredibly important, but I'll start training this way again before I start competing again. 

**What challenges do you face?** Fuck this question. I'm not about to talk about what's standing in my way. 

**How do you motivate yourself?** 

This one is complicated. Mostly

**How do you deal with naysayers and clashes between your lifestyle and that of your SO/friends/co-workers?** 

I don't. My friends think it's awesome. I get jokes and too many requests to help people move

No, “You are the average of your 5 closest friends”. I first heard this from Charles Poliquin, and I think about this all the time. Surround yourself with people that will lift you up, not bring you down. 

**What advice do you take

I take advice from people that have been there. There are so many weak people out there trying to write articles about how to get stronger. I've beaten many of these so called “strength athletes” being a mediocre athlete at best. How can they get me stronger when they can't do it themselves? A while back, he took second in a NOVICE competition with 3 people in his weight class. He would have gotten destroyed at a real meet, but he was writing about strongman like he knew the sport. But this guy is free to write articles on the internet, and people think that makes him qualified.

This is just one example. Another guy I've competed against wrote an article “how to bench 405lbs” or something like that. He's never benched 405
I've been incredibly fortunate in where I've been. I've trained at westside, and had waffles with Louie Simmons. These guys know more than you could ever learn from an article. Nick taught me more on one session than I ever learned from thousands of articles or 2 years of education in biomechanics. These are the kind of people I take advice from. I'll listen to ANYONE, but I'm real careful of what I'll apply. 

**What are some training or diet-related things you know are true but cannot prove?** 

Pain tolerance is more important to success in my sport than natural ability.

**Is there anything that you do differently in your sport/training/diet that you've never seen others do? Any other little innovations you don't mind sharing?** 

Haha there's a lot I do differently

**What injuries have you dealt with? What are the injury risks that come with your athletic endeavors?**

I don't military press and very rarely push press because of my shoulder. As a volleyball player it's really hard to press in the vertical plane because of the adaptations your shoulder goes through. I also very rarely go to 1RM because I don't see a need to
Volleyball wise

I have packed a guy off a jump serve

I have slammed (blocked) a guy so straight down that he landed on 
the ball. Didn't sprain his ankle though.

I have hit over a 6 '8 guy who plays for Team Canada.

I also get higher than most 6 '8 guys when I play. This was a shocker to me.

**What are your current athletic or fitness-related goals?**

Maintaining my vertical
Lifting wise, I've got extremely long femurs and tibias.

**What is your workout or training regimen?**

I follow a vague version of Westside for Skinny Bastards. Vague because I like more volume in my leg days and I tweaked the program a bit to allow for my weak areas. I've got every stereotypical athlete weakness like weak scapula retractors and weak external rotators. Right now I've given up full squatting for more back squatting as it keeps the stress off of my knees and I'm focusing more on my posterior chain strength.

**What does your diet look like? Do you take any supplements?**

I keep it clean nowdays. No pop and as little junk food as possible. I don't worry too much about my diet because I'm not trying to lose weight. I like my weight where it is, one at 1 and one at 3.30ish which'll mostly conist of rice. And then a dinner at around 8 that consists of more rice. It doesn't sound like much but it is a lot.
I take fish oils

**What is your competition and/or training philosophy?**

I really like the one that goes something like ""If you're not training right now
A couple of ones I also like are ""The worst thing I can be is the same as everyone else."" and ""Many a man has failed because he had his wishbone where his backbone should have been.""

**What challenges do you face?**

Myself. I am my biggest threat in that I will stop myself from doing something because of the fear of failing or looking like a fool. Other than that

**How do you motivate yourself?**

I watch olympic lifting videos. If that doesn't motivate you, girls will come flocking to me. No seriously, I do. And then there's the mirror. Biggest motivator ever.

**How do you deal with naysayers and clashes between your lifestyle and that of your SO/friends/co-workers?**

I've been lucky in this in that I have support from my family and friends because they like lifting too.

**What advice do you take

I take any advice. I don't care if a 90lb girl comes up to me in the gym and tells me I'm squatting wrong. Hey maybe she saw something I didn't. If it sounds like nonsense, I will try it. I don't get why people get all mad if somebody points out a flaw. If my knees are buckling, I don't care who says it...
I ignore diet advice right now because I don't really care about it. I'm at around 13% bodyfat (though it looks more like 8 because of my muscle mass) and right now I couldn't care about what I eat. This will change soon however. I also ignore anybody that spouts dogma. Things like knees should not extend toes or you should always go all the way down on squatting. If a person doesn't think before he says something

**What are some training or diet-related things you know are true but cannot prove?**

I think box squats for tall people are the bomb. When i stopped box squatting and focused solely on back and front squatting, and not the quads. I know Wendler has said that a box squat doesn't turn over to a back squat but I disagree. There's a reason that DeFranco has all his athletes box squatting.

**Is there anything that you do differently in your sport/training/diet that you've never seen others do? Any other little innovations you don't mind sharing?**
Uhm...I squat a lot. Like sometimes 3 days a week. People ask me how I jump so high and I tell them it's because I work hard at it. Other than that I'm fairly fundamental. I would not give my workouts to anybody else though

**What injuries have you dealt with? What are the injury risks that come with your athletic endeavors?**

Shoulders

**Any advice on how to deal with these injuries and risks?**
For the shoulders
For the knees

**What are your favorite sports/fitness books/DVDs/websites?**

Anything by Eric Cressey, Bill Hartman, Pavel Tsatsouline, Steve Maxwell and Joe Defranco. Heck too many to name.

Alright, I need to ~~give blame~~ say thanks to some people:

* shortkid: meet prep/advice/template for this report.
* triplewithcheese: Form advice and meet prep/advice
* threewhitelights: Form advice
* silverhydrates: Answering my ""Does choline affect sleep"" question *(Answer is no BTW)*

Just kidding

I guess it started right after my last meet just 4 weeks ago. I saw the numbers these guys were doing and I wanted to try my hand at super loading my squat for partial reps. Well, I've been working around the fatigue of that.

Also, I think I solved how to fix that on a regular basis.*(more later)*

Also, but it meant I really couldn't count on the exact same meet prep as last time.

Lastly

After all that bullshit, I decided to stop and it was aching me really bad for the next week. Stairs, bent too long on train, etc. Then something hit me, ""Maybe it's muscle tightness?"" 

So I rolled the fuck out of my quads, massive pain, no tenseness, rolling from top down. Sure enough, about 95% of the pain went away, but I was still worried because I hadn't felt any pain at all before that 305 squat. ""Maybe I'll just have to take a low opener so I can at least total."" etc. So, again I didn't really make a plan on how to hit 500kg. Which was stupid

Then the kicker - Friday before. Watching shortkid on the webcam and I start to feel that tickle in the back of your throat the tells you your getting sick. *ugh* Spent the next couple days fighting that off with massive amounts of green tea and overdosing on my supplements. 

We got there Sat afternoon so we decided to check out the afternoon squats. It was total madness. There were over 100 lifters in 90 &amp; 100kg men's classes *plus* the women. The room was packed with several hundred people and they had **three** platforms running with 3 flights on all. The heavy hitters were up front so I saw 220lb guy grind out a 600.8lb squat. He looked quite depleted afterward and was walking funny. I had hoped he didn't hurt himself like they guy a few mins before who looked to pull a muscle on a 500+ attempt. The one other notable thing about the afternoon was I saw a guy unrack ~530lb squat

Afternoon impression: This is some serious shit! 

We couldn't stay because I wanted to just rest some more and work off my ill feeling...Went to bed on Sat around 9:30 and popped a Nyquil to help me sleep in addition to 2g Choline

Woke up Sunday morning feeling not bad but a bit tired. Didn't feel sick at least. Took a nice hot shower to loosen up and headed down for gear check and weigh-ins.

There would be two platforms and two flights each. I was with the Masters and Juniors following the women and the Open guys had two flights on their own platform.

**Squats**

It took me a really long time to warmup on squats as I still felt rickety and testing my knee. I probably did too much warm-up, keep lifting a couple things' My open was going to be 325 and I wanted to know how my knee felt. 275 warmups were good, so I saw a 315 on a rack and did one. Felt good, but worried if too much weight would affect me. I felt the knowledge was worth the cost of energy. Besides I was sucking down espresso like there was going to be a shortage.

Went out for the opener and holy shit, so I picked 2.5kg over my last one and ground it out pretty good. I had a pie in the sky target of 375, but I also remembered that one of my goals since Jan 1 was to squat 365 before my birthday in Oct. I decided to go with 369 instead so I could hit that goal now and be safe about it. 

Nailed it w/ some room to spare. Over all squats went great! How about that?

....that's when the stupid began.

**Bench**

I had in my mind pre-meet I was going to go for 303lbs on my second. Go for the PR. Go big...bah. Not thinking about adjusting if needed to.  My opener was 286.5 and it felt ok and a bit sluggish. Knowing that same thing just happened on squats I still went for 303

Well

**Deadlift**

Warmups felt ok

I thought I had it. Got it off the ground and started to strain but still moving it. Then the stars came. ""Fuck you stars, put the weight down and felt *absolutely dead*. Put everything I had into it. I almost declined the third attempt as I knew I wasn't going to make it and my hammies where screaming at me on the last one too. But I tried anyway and barely got it off the ground.

In the end I totalled exactly what I did in my last meet.

**Takeaways**

Don't be fucking stupid. 

Hindsight is 20/20 but here are the main points.

* Meet bench is not touch and go bench. Always go for a meet PR first. If it's also your personal PR
* Unless you have recently lifted well over your meet PR in any lift
* Don't be a hero. Had I just gone for a DL PR of 424.2
* Come in with a plan for both good and bad days. Period.
* Bring more espresso. Lots more...
* Maxing out three lift s in 2-3 hours is **rough**. I was soooo dead after and the rest of the day. My DOMS today is not bad as I ate a shitload of crap throughout the day yesterday.
* I continue to be blown away by the strength out there. The speed in the warm up rooms of the Open guys doing the 3-400lb warmups was insane. Really motivates me.
* Master's competitors continue to surprise the fuck out of me. The small guy who looked the least muscley and most beer bellied of all was lifting 500-600lb in squat and DL and 400+ in bench. I mean seriously

&gt;Finally, and it’s not even the most important one.  Of more relevance here, VO2 max and aerobic endurance are not at all synonymous, many people confuse the two because they don’t understand the difference between aerobic power (VO2 max) and aerobic capacity (determined primarily by enzyme activity and mitochondrial density within the muscle).  Other studies have shown clearly that interval work and steady state work generate different results in this regards, intervals improve VO2 max but can actually decrease aerobic enzyme activity (citrate synthase) within skeletal muscle.

* 1. Is there any way in which moderate intensity steady state cardio is superior to HIIT?

 2. What does 28% increased anaerobic capacity really mean?

 3. Are tabatas really worthwhile considering they are only proven to increase VO2 max slightly more than steady state cardio and maybe not even more than doing 30 minutes of regular HIIT? Or have their been any new studies using tabata like protocols?

**What’s your story? When

My story is more about my weight than about fitness

I changed gyms to this scruffy, I started doing a lot of reading, found my way to r/fitness and read a lot about weight lifting. I would get the trainer to teach me how to do certain free weight exercises and he seemed enthusiastic about that so I read more and did more on my own.

Since February of last year

In September
When I got back

What I've done isn't much compared to so many other people but I continue to amaze myself. That counts for something.

**Do you want to share any athletic or fitness-related goals

I ran a 5K last week. I've signed up for the Warrior Dash

My successes come every few months when I realize I'm stronger, I can push myself to do more.

**What is your workout or training regimen?**

5-6 days a week which involves lifting days (squats, bench press, low rows, assisted pull ups, weighted lunges or bulgarian split squats and ab work [plank variations, kick ups, etc.])

**What does your diet look like? Do you take any supplements?**

My diet is clean about 90% of the time but most of my friends are sedentary which means when I spend time with them

I should note that I've been losing and gaining the same ten pounds for the last three months. I did a bit of a mental inventory a few weeks ago and have been kicking my ass and being more vigilant. I'd like to move into maintenance by the end of the summer; that would be so great.

A typical day food-wise:

breakfast - a slice of crustless quiche (eggs, fake bacon, cheese) and a soy shake (soy milk, greek yogurt, some kind of fruit)

lunch - deconstructed cabbage rolls (chopped cabbage

dinner - turkey sausage and broccoli

I'm a calorie counter and eat lower carb but I'm not afraid of our friend

My only supplements are fish oil and calcium/magnesium.

**What have you achieved so far? What are your ‘numbers’ (times, etc)?**

I'm currently running a 30 min 5K. My squat and DL are about the same - squats 5X5 115 on the last set

My military press truly is the saddest thing you'll ever see - 50lbs. Oh

My bench is 85lbs. Low row is 105lbs.

The only person you're ever really competing with is yourself so constantly try and outdo yourself and if you have a day where you suck

**What challenges do you face?**

My weight will always be my biggest challenge. 

**How do you motivate yourself?**

I don't know. Being active is just a part of my life now. Losing weight and seeing the who I was under all that fat is also part of the motivator. No longer being invisible is also a motivator. Knowing that regardless of how tired or pissed off I am

**How do you deal with naysayers and clashes between your lifestyle and that of your SO/friends/co-workers?**

There are no naysayers in my life with the exception of one person who's opinion doesn't matter to me. However

**What advice do you take

Anyone who's militant in their advice - i.e. people who push vibrams or keto or whatever

**What are some training or diet-related things you know are true but cannot prove?**

Eating less carbs makes me less hungry. Cardio is an essential part of being fit and healthy. I learn better by doing rather than reading.

**Is there anything that you do differently in your sport/training/diet that you've never seen others do? Any other little innovations you don't mind sharing?**

I make competitions for myself with rewards and penalties. I.e. If I stop to walk during a run I have to either run longer or do other cardio if I'm at the gym. If I beat a record

**What injuries have you dealt with? What are the injury risks that come with your athletic endeavors?**

I was in an accident when I was a kid. I sometimes have weird pain in my pelvis as a result - sometimes from running or just generally when it rains. I have balance issues and some mobility/discomfort issues for odd one-off kind of things. Mountain climbers are super uncomfortable for me. Any pressure on my hip bones is also very uncomfortable. Luckily

I also have morton's neuroma and fallen metatarsal arches. I wear orthodics as a result. 

**Any advice on how to deal with these injuries and risks?**

Well, the only advice I can impart is that yes, wearing 4-inch heels does exacerbate the problem. There's a big fucking surprise.

**What sports or fitness activities are you involved in? Do you compete at any level?**

Weight lifting (four times a week), recreational volleyball, bicycling (work commute, summers).

**What’s your story? When

The short of it: 22 years of laziness and inactivity, which prompted me to join a gym and begin sprinting with some random air-powered Nautilus machine exercises thrown in. I didn’t gain any muscle whatsoever, but I got lean very quickly (155-160 pounds – yeah, at 6’4”).

I maintained this weight for a long while. In 2009, which bordered on malnutrition, but I did very well with improving technique and even won some rec-level regattas.

After the summer of 2009, I couldn’t squat (horrible hamstring inflexibility and quarter-squats), and I couldn’t do proper pullups worth anything. An epic 45 pound bulk, a quick switch to Starting Stength, and 3 or 4 months later, I was looking and lifting a hell of a lot stronger; I was deadlifting three plates for reps, my squat had improved to parallel at 3x5x235
After that little stint, and programming. A new passion was born (mostly spawned from an addictive personality).

**What are your current athletic or fitness-related goals?**

I’m one of those people that has goals, but who doesn’t? I do make sure to have workout, short-term, and long-term goals, but I find that they change often and it doesn’t make much sense to make it public. There’s a good TED talk about that somewhere.
I did once say “I want to be the grandpa that does backflips”. I’ll leave it at that.

**What is your workout or training regimen?**

Wendler’s 5/3/1 with boring but big/triumvirate/volume accessories. Lots of hip thrusts, kettlebell exercises, ab wheel rollouts, dragon flags, and dips. I have my own basement gym that I call The Iron Garden (I posted about it somewhere here) and that I expand often (I just got myself a pair of rings and play with them often; got a GymBoss for interval training a few weeks ago; a while back I bought a nice 53-pound kettlebell). Next up: a better deadlift station. My workouts are usually posted on Fitocracy.
Other than two vacations

**What does your diet look like? Do you take any supplements?**

I’m following the one pre-workout meal Leangains protocol with a milder version of carb-backloading and low-carb off days (a “Cheat Mode” variation). I track calories and usually fall under 120F/225P/80C on off-days
I eat heavy dairy post-workout. I live on cottage cheese. I eat tons of broccoli (bag lady’s exact quote from last week’s trip to the grocery store: “HOLY SHIT that’s a lot of broccoli). I eat berries in pounds. I love oats more than my own family.
Daily supplements: 15g liquid fish oil, 6g beta-alanine, 5g creatine, 650mg DMAE, 600mg caffeine, 72mg ephedrine, Psyllium husk.

Sometimes supplements: melatonin, BCAAs (fasted training).

**What have you achieved so far? What are your ‘numbers’ (times, etc)?**

I’m very-much a beginner in this sport. I’m constantly readjusting, probably closer to 1x450 or higher if I tested it now), squat is at 255x8 (adjusting to a new wide-stance form; I’ll be going for a new tested 1RM in a few weeks), weighted pull-ups at 2x90lbs (did these for the first time on Friday), overhead press is at 155x5 (couple weeks ago), Kroc rows are at 115x20, weighted dips at 60x8 (though they’re starting to feel easy).
With rowing, but good for a rec dude like me.

I don’t really care about numbers all that much. I find I’m much more competitive with myself than I’d ever be with another person. I did care, then I leave the gym a happy man. I realize now that everyone has different strengths and weaknesses; different lever lengths and muscle insertions: it’s silly to compare myself to anyone else.

**What is your competition and/or training philosophy?**

There are a few quotes that I like to share around Fittit a lot. I’m sure you’ve seen me post them. Together

“Sooner or later we all discover that the big moments in life are not the advertised ones, the weddings, not the great goals achieved. The real milestones are less prepossessing. They come to the door of memory unannounced, stray dogs that amble in, sniff around a bit and simply never leave. Our lives are measured by these. You were born an original. Don't die a copy. There is no cure for birth and death save to enjoy the interval.” 
- Susan B. Anthony 

“No citizen has a right to be an amateur in the matter of physical training…what a disgrace it is for a man to grow old without ever seeing the beauty and strength of which his body is capable.” – Socrates

“It is better to be a warrior in the garden than a gardener at war.” – Japanese proverb

""We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence, but a habit."" - Aristotle

**How do you motivate yourself?**

I’m with Scottydog on this: I don’t have to. I do it because I love it. I don’t eat well or train hard because I force myself to do it; I do those things because it’s frakkin’ awesome.

**How do you deal with naysayers and clashes between your lifestyle and that of your SO/friends/co-workers?**

I’ve only ever had issues with explaining my diet to others. If they accept my offer to see the studies, it’s usually more of a “Dude, what program should I do?!”, followed by “you should probably do Starting Strength, brah”, followed by him doing squats once. It’s a neverending cycle with friends who want results but don’t have the mindset to get them. I'm thinking that addictive personality helps.

**What advice do you take

It was always incredibly difficult for me to take advice; I was always so stubborn and know-it-all I’d get offended if someone had an opposing view.

It took me a while to learn to accept advice with open arms. I’ll listen to anyone, I’ll usually try it out. I certainly would have never tried Leangains, 5/3/1, or keto without an open mind.

**What are some training or diet-related things you know are true but cannot prove?**

A lot of the time
I love strength followed by volume when cutting. It’s the shit. I’ve never had my arms grow so quickly
Taking a week off can set me back a month or two in squatting. I don’t know why. Everything else is fine.
Loud instrumental progressive metal or heavy post-rock is the best music to work out to.

**Is there anything that you do differently in your sport/training/diet that you've never seen others do? Any other little innovations you don't mind sharing?**

Most of what I do I steal from others. My programming/diet is a cut-and-paste of dozens of things that I’ve come across. Leangains, timed carb diet, 5/3/1, Texas Method, keto diets, GOMAD, paleo, Mediterranean diet, Fittit posts

I think that might be something that I’m doing a little differently: I’m always changing something small until I get the most optimal solution. I call it... Zahrada’s Natural Selection Diet and Fitness Program. Wait

I have also trained naked

**What injuries have you dealt with? What are the injury risks that come with your athletic endeavors?**

Some minor tendonitis from crappy squat form

**Any advice on how to deal with these injuries and risks?**

I fear the day that I’m injured. I know I’d have to hold myself back

**What are your favorite sports/fitness books/DVDs/websites?**

I read a couple dozen blogs from people that are smarter than me in hopes of finding things to try. Most of the books that I’ve read on fitness are listed in the Fittit FAQ.

My question is:

**Is there any evidence, heavy lifting would decrease ADHD symptoms?**

Some additional information:

* 20yo female
* usually weight training (olympic, pick-up basketball whenever my schedule permits
* I am prescribed 10mg adderall/2x daily.

Basically, and I usually end up having to just self-teach the majority of the material. I routinely lose things. Behavioral interventions only work to a certain extent.

**However:** doing very heavy, because hyperactivity, although it is a problem, is hardly what I struggle with the most). It honestly feels like the ""interruptions"" or ""noise"" is almost eliminated for ~30-60 minutes, and then is lessened for the remainder of the day.

Other things that have worked for me include coffee and also


My hypothesis is that CNS fatigue is directly correlated with a reduction in ADHD symptoms. I'm wondering what all of these things have in common

**What sports or fitness activities are you involved in? Do you compete at any level?**

Olympic weightlifting is my sport. I mostly compete at club and state level

**What’s your story? When

In my middle years at highschool I bought Arnold's New Encyclopedia of Bodybuilding. Before long I was at a local gym doing all sorts of stuff
To his credit Arnold really values of the squat and so I was squatting from the start.

When I first got to university, girls stopped admiring my Great Personality.

Then depression struck. It blew my life to pieces

Then I wanted to impress a girl, but it started to remind me of how much I enjoyed the act of training.

I came across StrongLifts 5x5 and switched to that. I probably put on more visible muscle in the first 3 months of that than I had in the previous 18 months of fiddly exercising.

Finally, then come back to my regular gym"".
That was about 2 years ago.

**What are your current athletic or fitness-related goals?**

My goal this year is to make a 300kg total in competition. I'd also like to push my squat past 250kg.

**What is your workout or training regimen?**

It depends very much on what competitions are coming up. Competitive Oly lifters tend to program backwards from desirable competitions they can enter. I only started doing this in the past 6 months for the national club comp and the Arafura Games.
Right now I'm between coaches. My coach here has moved away. I live
Since there's no more major comps this year I am aiming to get stronger as fast as possible.

**What does your diet look like? Do you take any supplements?**

I am trying cheatmode at the moment, curries, frozen chicken. Lately I am trying to eat more vegetables. One big bowl of salad with every dinner. I keep boiled eggs around for post-training snacks on heavy days.

I take this twice per day:

6x fish oil tablet (1g) 1x multi 1x CoQ10 1x glucosamine (500mg)

At night I add:

1x milk thistle 2x 22mg zinc tablet

During training I have a 3 litre bottle with gatorade powder and dextrose

After training I have a whey shake. Three scoops
My rule for supplements is that they should be cheap. Probably my only non-negotiable is fish oil

**What have you achieved so far? What are your ‘numbers’ (times, etc)?**

Surprisingly poor this year. I raced up to 240kg in three competitions and I've been stuck there for about 6 months.

I think it's largely psychological

**What is your competition and/or training philosophy?**

I've learned in competition that you can be too relaxed and you can be too psyched-up. It's about finding that intense focus in the middle somewhere. The thing about Oly lifting is that you can't ""cram"" it. Every competition total is earned in the months of work leading up to it. No one session makes the difference. It's cumulative.

Another thing is how easily small things can throw you out. Going into the club nationals I felt I'd pull 120/140. I discovered on a Friday I'd be lifting on Saturday instead of Sunday. On the day I got into an argument with my coach about my starting lifts. These small things threw me off and I posted a disappointing total after busting my butt for 8 weeks coming in.

When there's a good coach in hand

**What challenges do you face?**

Firstly

Second is fatigue -- juggling work

Training can be done with a certain degree of mindlessness

Luckily I have an awesome employer. They're giving me time off starting in July to go back to Perth to finish my degree full time.

**How do you motivate yourself?**

Habit. Going the same days every week. Unless I am injured or resting up for a comp

I think of habit as the capital form of willpower. You spend a lot of willpower upfront to create a habit

**What advice do you take

My coaches get annoyed at me when I push myself too hard. I never thought I'd be the guy doing it -- I'm deferential by nature -- but you start doing more and more and you want to do more and more. But short-term you is not thinking about the fact that you're not managing fatigue. That's why coaches want you to follow the plan.

**Is there anything that you do differently in your sport/training/diet that you've never seen others do? Any other little innovations you don't mind sharing?**

I have one trick I developed for setting the start position.
Grip the bar at your width. Rotate the elbows backwards, release your elbows so that they assume the neutral position.

**What injuries have you dealt with? What are the injury risks that come with your athletic endeavors?**

I've had bulged spinal discs

The classic risks for Olympic lifting are: sore knees and blown discs. The knees especially if you get into the (very bad) habit of stomping/donkey-kicking.

Blowing or bulging a disc is a possibility if you don't keep the tight lower back. If the form is right

**Any advice on how to deal with these injuries and risks?**

Don't be a spastic dipshit like me. In spite of what I said above

**What are your favorite sports/fitness books/DVDs/websites?**

I rather enjoy fittit. I look at t-nation sometimes. I've got a copy of Everett's book on weightlifting

**Anything else you want to add?**

**What sports or fitness activities are you involved in? Do you compete at any level?**

I lift weights

**What’s your story? When

It seems like my story is the opposite of most as I started playing sports and having an active lifestyle since I was about 5 when I played flag football. My dad was a huge sports fan and so that carried over to me. I played football, which I could not afford. That was the end of my organized athletics, but I still played intramural basketball quite a bit and honed my power forward moves in the '6 and under' leagues. :o). I even managed to play with the varsity B-Ball team quite often during the offseason and that was pretty exciting as there was generally a big crowd around to watch.

After college I pretty much lost touch with basketball as it got harder to find time to play and places to play with people I enjoyed playing with. I kept up with weights

My 30s I kind of fell out of continuous practice for much of the time because of life. On for a few months, after running about 25-30 miles a week for a couple years, I decided I wanted to run a marathon and started training. 

Unfortunately
I started getting pretty serious again in late Jan last year (2010) and if you've followed /r/fitness for the last year

**What have you achieved so far? What are your ‘numbers’ (times, etc)?**

In no particular order

* Unofficial 1/2 marathon while training for a marathon a couple years ago. (Stopped due to injury)
* 90 lb DB Turkish Get-up
* 100 TGUs in a row with 20kg kettlebell
* 275x3x5 squat but my only actual 1RM max after that was 285
* 375lb Deadlift (no belt or chalk)
* 225x13 and a 1RM of 275lb bench
* 150lbx6 OHP

**What are your current athletic or fitness-related goals?**

Before Oct 24th (when I turn 40):

* TGU 110lb DB; once each hand (largest in the gym)
* OHP 185lbs
* Bench 315lbs
* Squat 365lbs
* DL 405lbs
* Pass SSST w/ a 24kg kettlebell (200+ snatches in 10mins)
* Be able to run 6-7 miles &lt; 60 mins again
* 10+ consecutive pull-ups
* &lt; 200lbs BW

Life goals

* Stay injury free
* Run a marathon (under 4:00:00)
* Continue enjoying working out and progressing as well as a 40+ man can...

**What is your workout or training regimen?**

Currently following Wendler's 5/3/1 and just kind of making up the assistance stuff on a week to week to basis. Lately I've been liking the Boring But Big because it's simple and coupled with my current diet I'm seeing more results. I use Kettlebells mostly for conditioning work or as assistance work for 5/3/1. Since I need short workouts (~60mins), Bench, OHP, Dips, Pull-ups, Rows, and butt work).

**What does your diet look like? Do you take any supplements?**

I'm kind of fast and loose with my diet. I'm old and set in my ways, but I don't need to be ripped. If I could get to 12-15%, I would be happy.

Until recently the only supplements I took were fish oil and some beefcake powder (whey). Since my diet sometimes sucks, Vit-D, Veggie Pills) and since I'm old and starting to get senile, looking into Nootropics (Choline now, maybe some racetams in the future). I just starting taking some Beta-Alanine, but since I've been sick lately I haven't had a long enough time to see how it affects my workouts or recovery.

I also dose with resveratrol many evenings to relax...

**What is your competition and/or training philosophy?**

Oh god. This used to be balls to the wall, not a sprint"") That has been serving me well in the last 9 months. Not every session has to be a record or an exact set of exercises. Not every week has to be the same. This is why I like Wendler's plan so much. There have been several times when I've had to pull double duty on a day due to life. I do the two main lifts and fuck off. I'm still progressing and I don't need to feel bad about it.

**What challenges do you face?**

The life of a mid career

I'm a technology manager at a major investment bank and most people seem to think that making billions of dollars is more important than my workout.

I have some Scoliosis and two bulging discs my lower back.

I have some form of insomnia that prevents me from sleeping a full night most every night. The fact that my back hurts most of the time doesn't help this either.

I've also sustained quite a few injuries in my life that will act up or force me to really think about what I'm doing.

**How do you motivate yourself?**

It's fun. No motivation needed. Sorry

**How do you deal with naysayers and clashes between your lifestyle and that of your SO/friends/co-workers?**

I guess I'm pretty fortunate in that I don't have many naysayers when it comes to the actual working out. All my office buddies exercise and think about their weight in some regard. The biggest challenge is getting my family members (both immediate and expanded) to understand that IF is ok, etc...

Proof is in the pudding though, but I also see it as a chance to really learn because as anyone knows, you don't really know a subject until you can explain it to someone else.

**What advice do you take

I would rather take anecdotal advice of someone I trust over scientific any day. However, I'll take anecdotal.

I'll hang my head in shame and say I've yet to use a belt for anything

**What are some training or diet-related things you know are true but cannot prove?**

* I'll have my best day in the gym if no one is there to witness it.
* You can replace lost sleep with extra food for a short time period (~7 days).
* I believe lifting weights has given me super fast reflexes and that it will help me stave off mental issues as I get older.
* I believe lifting weights will help me stay out of a Life Alert commercial when I get older.
* *When you think you are at your limits

**Is there anything that you do differently in your sport/training/diet that you've never seen others do?**

I don't listen to music while lifting. I like being alone with my thoughts and I am good a zoning out external noises. Also

**What injuries have you dealt with? What are the injury risks that come with your athletic endeavors?**

Since I was 5

* Broken elbow
* Hyper extended knee
* Severe road rash (on my face
being knocked out cold.
* About 2-3 sprains per ankle and 2-3 twists per ankle
* Broken wrist
* Broken toe
* Broken rib
* Broken noses
* Broken fingers
* Torn rotator cuff
* Pulled hamstring
* Torn Achilles
* Torn hamstring
* Wounded pride (ok

**Any advice on how to deal with these injuries and risks?**

Go slow. See above comment about fitness being a marathon. Pushing too fast is a quick prescription for getting hurt.

When you get hurt: First, tape, ice and intestinal fortitude were about the extent of my medical treatments. Now I have aches and pains everywhere. It seems like there isn't a day that goes by when there isn't at least one thing nagging me. Getting injuries treated properly is the most important advice I would recommend to anyone.

**What are your favorite sports/fitness books/DVDs/websites?**

Obviously Reddit and T-Nation. I prefer to bounce ideas off a few trusted individuals than read through copious amounts of web. Although

Insulin’s effect on Muscle Protein Synthesis (MPS) is frequently attributed to its roll in signaling mTor and localizing nutrient uptake proteins to the surface of mytocytes (i.e. Glut 4).  While this is true, they simply differ in that nutritive feeds myocytes while non-nutritive supplies adipocytes ([4](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10759589?dopt=Citation), [5](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7762631?dopt=Citation)).

* Greater Flexibility required.

* Less compressive forces on the knee.

* Harder to cheat by shooting hips backwards during upward motion as you will drop the bar

* Easier to self teach because if your form is wrong as per above you will drop the bar

* It works the quadriceps

As per the study below.

Here's a picture from about [a month ago](\(http://i.imgur.com/d4fkb.jpg\)). This is just after a workout and I'm flexing my quad @ 6'0''

**Age?** 31.333 **Sex?** I'm easy. 

**What sports or fitness activities are you involved in?** 

I lift weights. I'm trying to be a runner as well. I 'compete' only on a rec level. During the summer I play in an Ultimate Frisbee league and I play indoor soccer during the winter. I'm also really into yard games and other 'leisure' sports. They are my bread and butter. 

**What’s your story?** 

This is going to be boring

Somewhere around 16 I decided I needed to tone up and get abs so I started using the HS weight room after school. When I think about the 'deadlifts' I did back then… ugh. I've been in and out of the weight room ever since. When I got to college I played a lot of intramurals my freshman year and I met a guy who was playing lacrosse for the school's club team. They just needed bodies so it didn't matter that I'd never even held a stick. Reluctantly I went to the first practice and was hooked. I played all four years and loved it. I managed to become a starting midfielder and face-off specialist. But

After college I've mainly just stuck to lifting weights and inconsistent running with a peppering of casual sports. My inconsistency and lack of sound programming had me forever doomed to decent but

A couple years ago

**Do you want to share any athletic or fitness-related goals

September of last year I was a pretty lean 165lbs. But looking in the mirror I knew I needed to add some muscle. Learning to eat more was, but in February of this year I gave Starting Strength a go and discovered the Svunt Shake. Finally everything clicked into place. From Feb-May I gained 15lbs pounds while staying on the same belt notch. As a lifelong 'hardgainer', this is my proudest achievement. I'm thinking I'd like to get into the mid 190s, and I think this winter is when that is going to go down. Current lifting maximums with future goals: 

* Squat - 240x5x5. This was at the beginning of the summer

* Deadlift - 315x1

* Bench - 225x1 a couple weeks ago. I think I could go higher

* OHP - 135x1 also at the beginning of the summer. I just want this to go up. BWx1 at least. 

* Unofficially I've run a 59 minute 10K. I'd like to get that under 50. 

**What is your workout or training regimen?** 

I started a 10K training program through RunKeeper in May. My plan was to continue the Starting Strength routine concurrently
My plan is to stick with this into the fall. 

**What does your diet look like? Do you take any supplements?** 

I fucking love my diet. As hippie eco-nuts, either through the food co-op, farmers markets, or our meager garden. My wife gets two dozen eggs each week from a lady she works with that raises hens at her house. $1 per dozen. :D Here's [a picture of the pork chops I'll be eating this fall](http://i.imgur.com/R2emt.jpg\). My wife is a fantastic cook and I eat like a king. Even though I hate the label, I'd say about 80% of my diet is 'paleo'. Whole foods, plenty of fruit, meat, and dishes cooked from scratch just seems like a no-brainer to me. The other 20% of my diet is impulse and convenience foods. I don't shy away from any snack, and any respectable cave man would gorge on that shit. I don't know my macro breakdown but I aim for 3000-3500 calories per day, fish oil

**What is your competition and/or training philosophy?** 

I'm in this for the long haul. I want my body to be a well oiled machine that can be called upon at a moment's notice and I want that to be true well into my later years. The trick, with the patience and wisdom to realize that this is the tortoise's race to win. 

**How do you motivate yourself?** 

My brother once asked me why I do this. I couldn't give him an answer. I feel like it's an ""if you have to ask

**How do you deal with naysayers and clashes between your lifestyle and that of your SO/friends/co-workers?** 

My wife is the only 'naysayer' I have in my life. And sadly

**What advice do you take

All my advice comes from reddit, but most people's advice in r/fitness falls apart under the weight of one word - why? 

**What are some training or diet-related things you know are true but cannot prove?** 

1. Calories in vs. calories out is all 90% of people need to know for weight loss and gain
2. DOMS makes me stronger and faster. I feel like the DOMS-afflicted muscles contract from a stretched position with greater force allowing me to put up more weight or to run faster with no extra conscious effort. This could also just be in my head. But Abes agrees with me so I must be true. I also like the addition of his idea that DOMS provides greater proprioception. Sold. 

**Is there anything that you do differently in your sport/training/diet that you've never seen others do?** 

I know others do it, I'll reinforce the proper motions and hopefully form a more innate muscle memory. This could have gone in the previous section because I have no idea how well this theory pans out. 

**What injuries have you dealt with?** 

I've been very fortunate in that I've had really no major injuries to speak of. I am

**What sports or fitness activities are you involved in? Do you compete at any level?** 

My sport is running. I race events from the 800m on the track, it would be ""national class"".

**What's your story? When

I actually grew up playing baseball, but I was just average (and a bit overweight). I really didn't really start to love it until after I graduated high school. I went to University (I'm now in my junior year), and really started running more and have just kept improving to get where I'm at now.

**Do you want to share any athletic or fitness-related goals

Well, easily qualifying me for the Boston Marathon my first time. I've also just recently placed 75th overall at the Peachtree Road Race in Atlanta, out of 60,000 people... As for goals, my only current short term goal is a new PR for my fall marathon (Twin Cities in October) - I'd like to run low 2:30's, ideally breaking the 2:30 barrier if I can. 

My main long term goal is to qualify to run in the U.S. Olympic Trials marathon in 2015

**What is your workout or training regimen?**

My workout/training regiment is detailed in a simple way. Simply, twice a day. I have two running workouts per week, one being a long run/workout on Sundays that is usually between 17-22 miles long and then another shorter workout on Wed or Thurs which is usually like a track workout, tempo run, etc. I also have a core/ab workout I do every other day.

**What does your diet look like? Do you take any supplements?**

My diet is relatively a healthy one, grilled chicken (though I will splurge and eat red meat on occasion), and milk (I drink a ton of skim milk, I love it). I do drink Endurox R4 everyday after my longer run of the day and I also drink coconut water for hydration purposes (I gave up Powerade and Gatorade because of all the sugar. I don't drink soft drinks or eat things with too much sugar or fat. The only supplement I take is just a normal, everyday, multi-vitamin.


**What have you achieved so far? What are your 'numbers' (times, etc.)?**

I am 6'1

 * Mile- 4:17
 * 5k -15:28 
 * 10k - 32:10 
 * Half Marathon - 1:13:44 (unofficially) 
 * Marathon - 2:38:5X. .... 
 * and Bench Press - 165 lbs

**What is your competition and/or training philosophy?** 

I don't really have a philosophy, ""To give anything less than your best, is to sacrifice the gift.""

**What challenges do you face?** 

Well, money is an obstacle, while running itself is pretty cheap, traveling to races is not.

**How do you motivate yourself?** 

I keep thinking and visioning myself running certain times or in certain races. When I wake up to get my first run in and I don't feel like getting out to run, 2 years or even a decade from now, when I look back at my training and ask myself, 'did I do everything I possibly could to achieve my goals and be the best I was capable of?'.. I want to be able to say I did.""... As cliche and cheesy as that sounds, it works for me.

**How do you deal with naysayers and clashes between your lifestyle and that of your SO/friends/co-workers?** 

I ignore them. I'm sure you can believe when I tell people I want to compete in the Olympic trials among the best Americans that I get people who laugh at me. Thats just fuel for the fire. I want to prove them wrong (just like I have so far with my current PR's)... I am lucky enough to have very supportive friends and family

**What advice do you take

That's really on a case to case basis. I mean, other runners, etc. However, when a fitness buff who thinks they know about running tells me something, (for example: Barefoot/minimalist running is best for you -- I hear this all the time), I just nod my head and ignore them.

**What are some training or diet-related things you know are true but cannot prove?** 

Oh, back to the barefoot running debate, I know that barefoot running is not all its cracked up to be. You will never get me to train in Vibram five fingers, NEVER.

**Is there anything that you do differently in your sport/training/diet that you've never seen others do? Any other little innovations you don't mind sharing?** 

I can't think of anything specifically. My routines and diet are pretty much a mixture of everything I've ever read

**What injuries have you dealt with? What are the injury risks that come with your athletic endeavors?** 

I've been lucky enough to have not had any major running related injuries (knock on wood). But training the way I do, a friend of mine had a Femoral Stress fracture and couldnt run for almost 8 months.

**Any advice on how to deal with these injuries and risks?** 

The best advice I can give to prevent injuries are too warm-up, core and hip strengthening exercises are very important. It would surprise most people how lower leg injuries (knee to ankle) are actually caused by a misaligned hip.... If you are to get injured, ice and rest is key. Don't try to run/workout until you are completely healed!

**What are your favorite sports/fitness books/DVDs/websites?** - Sports: Running, 2nd edition and Lore of Running. DVD's: I like 'Running Reckless' with Anthony Famiglietti and also 'Fire on the Track' about Steve Prefontaine.

2. Pre-hab with Cuban Presses and miscellaneous resistance band work.

4. 5/3/1 for squats and deadlifts.

**What sports or fitness activities are you involved in? Do you compete at any level?** 

I am a long distance runner, love to lift, ski ([I live in CO](http://i.imgur.com/NAQ5D.jpg)!), and hike.

**What’s your story? When

I’ve always been a big girl, girls’ sports were lackluster at my school so I turned into a bookworm nerd and pianist. My weight fluctuated to a high of, lord knows, a pant size of 16, down after healthy eating to size 11 pant and 170 pounds or so, stayed at that until college.
At that time I did some small runs
Then the knight in shining armor comes. Some weird hippy who regularly buys salmon from me at a natural grocer. He hands me a bootleg DVD of “Chi Running
Forgive me though

**Do you want to share any athletic or fitness-related goals

My last marathon was a 4:02. I found two ladies running a good pace and kept them in sight, and when I met my boyfriend at 20 miles to pace with me, I had slowed significantly and announced “I think my legs will fail soon.” Around mile 23, a long slight incline halted me in my tracks, my legs started to wobble a bit and I wasn’t walking too well. In all my femaleness, emotions started to overwhelm me, and my spirit began to break. Right then and there I stopped, hands over my head, by sweet jeebus my legs were working again, sat down on the ground

My goals for the summer: One more marathon in October, and to complete a century on Aug 20 in Dillon, CO. I really didn't give myself enough time for the [century](http://www.circlethesummit.com/rideinfo.html) and I'm pretty nervous about it because of the climb (5500ft). We'll see.

**What is your workout or training regimen?** 

My running schedule was a bit wild this summer. I only gave myself 12 weeks for training and made it very simple: three long runs a week, and upper body lifting M W Fri. On rare occasions I would do a crazy run to the gym and squat session on Sundays after the long run, but my legs would be irreparably sore so I opted for some easy mountain hiking most of the time.

**What does your diet look like? Do you take any supplements?** 

My diet looks like a retarded amount of vegetables (10-15 servings a day), and whey protein daily. While on marathon schedule I eat low carb Sun-Tues and up carbs throughout the week until the end of Saturday night. Upped carbs include a zillion bananas, lentils, black beans, or hummus, oatmeal, stove popped popcorn, and not a lot of sugar or processed foods.

Calories range from 1300-1500 on non-running days, at least 100-120g a day, and calories on actual runs, which at this point has been 250-300 calories an hour, eaten mostly in fruit, peanut butter, fig newtons, or clif bars. No carb gels. That stuff makes me nauseous. I am nuts about electrolytes since I am a heavy

Endurance running is an highly introverted sport

**What have you achieved so far? What are your ‘numbers’ (times, etc)?**

My PRs for weights are as follows (I've only been lifting since November): Bench Press – 105 pounds Squat – 185 pounds Overhead Press – 75 pounds as of last week!

**What is your competition and/or training philosophy?** 

There is no blueprint for life. No elite time, and am sort of addicted to failure. As someone interested in linguistics, I get frustrated by the way we limit our competitions just to make arbitrary labels, records, and trophies.

I know that sounds flowery, biking, or rowing, and “strength training” as the mother of all else. Suddenly we’ve whittled our world down so we can acquire certain results, what we perceive to be the same results, and have lowered chances of failure. Yawn.

**What challenges do you face?** 

Many, and other failures of the body. This is really the first year I can go running and easily spend the rest of the day doing whatever else, unaffected.

I am absolutely undecided about my bodyweight

**How do you motivate yourself?** 

Spontaneity and adventure are big ones. If I find myself getting bored with one thing, or listening to new albums.

**How do you deal with naysayers and clashes between your lifestyle and that of your SO/friends/co-workers?** 

Clashes are few and far between. I treat running like a hobby

**What advice do you take

I ignore anything that sounds like an advertisement. I take advice pretty slowly and prefer to let myself learn the hard way

**What are some training or diet-related things you know are true but cannot prove?** 

Oh boy. I am not a genius on any of this. The only one I got is a frustration with distance running schedules because of the myth of “the wall” being at mile 20. There are many walls

**Is there anything that you do differently in your sport/training/diet that you've never seen others do? Any other little innovations you don't mind sharing?**

Definitely the mileage training. My running schedule was purely an invention of my own and created to give me confidence and experience with running the actual distance

I never stretch, I am naturally pretty flexible.

**What injuries have you dealt with? What are the injury risks that come with your athletic endeavors?**

No injuries. I haven’t had a single problem with running in three years! So help me god.

Most common injuries are shin splints, ankle pains, everything pains.

**Any advice on how to deal with these injuries and risks?** 

Well, one foot to each line. If it feels really weird, you’re most likely doing something wrong.

**Anything else you want to add?** 

I love you guys. Never take me too seriously,False,self,t5_2s9km,False,,,t3_j6jvw

* **What sports or fitness activities are you involved in? Do you compete at any level?**

I'm a former competitive powerlifter who still plays with somewhat heavy weights

* **What’s your story? When

After college and starting a career I realized I needed something to do other than work or I was going to end up that guy who repeatedly tells the same High School football stories while everyone listening assumes he was the water boy. Having a job with long hours meant team sports were out so I decided to make use of the fitness center in my apartment complex since I had 24 hour access. I started going 3 days a week before work and within a few months I outgrew all the machines and started pricing out gym memberships. I was shocked to find that the gyms in my area didn't open until 5AM and I was usually spent after work so I decided to build a home gym. 

Shortly after I got everything setup I decided I needed a goal other than ""be in shape"" and started talking to people about lifting weights. Most of the guys I talked to were bodybuilders or wannabe bodybuilders and honestly I enjoy food too much to stress out the way they do about their diet so I kept looking for a niche I though I fit in. Back before the internet was loaded down with site after site devoted to strength training there was a little corner on Usenet called alt.sport.weightlifting I spent a lot of time downloading threads about getting stronger and eventually ran across some threads about powerlifting. I had finally found a way to take lifting heavy things in the gym from a hobby to a sport. I posted like crazy

Then someone posted about a meet that was being held about an hour from where I lived and I decided to check it out. Keep in mind here that I hadn't ever seen the lifts performed in real life according to meet rules and hadn't even so much as met another powerlifter so I went in expecting to see these massive guys just throwing weights around. Long story short the meet was nothing like I expected

Meet day came and I was a wreck, I weighed in the morning of the meet and chatted with the meet director a little during the weigh in. He recognized my name from the newsgroup and wished me luck. Next I had to go and get my rack height for the monolift recorded. There were a couple guys running the lift who asked me way more questions than I had answers for so we settled on a height and width with the understanding that I was going to walk the weights out since that's how I had been training. I was lifting in the 242 novice division after weighing in at 227, the weight class put me in the first session, second flight. There were 4 others in my class and I was the only one not wearing a squat suit or knee wraps, out of place didn't even begin to describe how I felt. I started to think that I might have screwed up my attempts because I had the biggest opening squat in my class with 396 so when I finally got on the platform I was terrified that I was going to get buried and then bomb out of the meet. 

I got the signal and everything just became automatic, everything went so fast I forgot to walk the weight out like I had planned. As I was turning to leave the platform the back spotter grabbed me and said ""dude, not so deep next time"" and then pointed me over to the head judge. When I got there she was laughing and motioned for me to squat down beside her as the next lifter got ready. Then she looked over and said ""two things, first calm down this is supposed to be fun and second go buy a squat suit, you're going to be pretty good at this"". After that the butterflies were gone and I started to understand why people did this. I finished out going 462, 407, 551 and took second in the class by less than 10 pounds with lots of weight left on the platform. 

After the meet the director came up to me and asked where I was lifting

The start of my endurance sport training didn't have such a feel good story. A year before my last meet I ruptured two disks in a snowboarding wreck. I used powerlifting and the injury as an excuse to avoid anything that even looked like cardio and moved my way from a light 242 to a full 275 weighing in at 273 for my second to last meet. I had a good meet but spent the next two days laying on the living room floor because my back was so bad it hurt to even roll over. Then the turning point hit, which started the always popular ""I'm not always hurt"" defense complete with examples of whole weeks where I was up walking around in an almost normal manner. She was right I seemed to be having more bad days than good days as far as my back was concerned but I was too hard headed to stop lifting because the weights were still going up. Eventually the talk turned to my physical size. When I met my wife I weighed 170 pounds, was very lean and very active, now I was 100 pounds heavier and spent most of my free time laying down to rest my back. Something had to give so I decided it would be my body weight, I figured even if I lost some pounds from my lifts that I'd be able to hold on to enough strength to be competitive. 

I started walking and increased my sled work

In 2004 the company I was working for folded and I moved out of state, turns out it comes pretty naturally to me so that has become my primary conditioning work as I put a little more focus back into the strength side as I'm thinking about getting back on the platform.

* **What are your current athletic or fitness-related goals?**

I'm currently trying to put together programming that will let me get back to being competitive at least at the local level on the powerlifting side while keeping my back in one piece and keeping the athleticism up through martial arts. I've got several people trying to talk me into tournament fighting but I'm not so sure that's going to happen.

* **What is your workout or training regimen?** 

Four days a week I'm doing strength work

My strength work could best be described as a hybrid of Stephan Korte's 3x3 and Westside barbells conjugate method. In the past I had great success doing Korte's 3x3 on my own and then Westside with the group I trained with so I've taken what I liked of each one and I'm using them together.

Kung-Fu is laid out so that about half the class is combat related hitting targets, doing one arm snatches, odd grip pull ups or whatever sounds like fun that day. The basic idea is to just have fun and get a little skill work in. 

* **What does your diet look like? Do you take any supplements?**

This is where everyone is going to cringe, sun dried tomatoes and mozzarella that was left over from last night's dinner. My wife can cook and I love to eat so my diet has never been very strict. I've tried IF but my schedule makes it tough.

Supplements are about as simple as they get, in short to aid recovery from all the stupid things I do to myself.

* **What have you achieved so far? What are your ‘numbers’ (times, etc)?**

At my last powerlifting meet nearly 8 years I go finished out the meet at squat 805

My best 5K time is 16:38

* **What is your competition and/or training philosophy?**

Things are much simpler than they appear

* **What challenges do you face?** 

Well

* **How do you motivate yourself?**

I don't. I get out of bed at 4:30AM because I know that if I don't then I'll be regretting it at 8AM since there wasn't really a good reason to stay in bed. Regarding why I train the way I do or why I participate in the events that I do it's simply because I want to. I enjoy being able to say ""that sounds fun"" and then being able to go out and do it.

* **How do you deal with naysayers and clashes between your lifestyle and that of your SO/friends/co-workers?**

I don't deal with too many naysayers, those come often but it's not just based on the fitness side of my lifestyle, in short I'd rather be home playing with my kids or having dinner with my wife than out at a bar or hanging out with a bunch of guys so I politely decline their offers and enjoy my life the way I like to live it. 

My wife and I haven't had many clashes and honestly if one happens it's usually about my latest weird injury and it ends with her making it clear that when I hurt myself she's not the one to whine to. My kids fully embrace my insanity

* **What advice do you take

I openly accept technique/form advice

I ignore just about anything that sounds like someone is quoting a scientific journal. Sorry the journal might be right but if you can't break it down to common language then you don't understand it enough to be teaching me about it. I'm not impressed by people who memorize blocks of text but have no idea how it applies to the real world.

* **What are some training or diet-related things you know are true but cannot prove?**

This first one I think of as being common sense

Secondly I believe that there is a portion of your brain that limits muscular output

* **Is there anything that you do differently in your sport/training/diet that you've never seen others do? Any other little innovations you don't mind sharing?**

I am totally unique just like everyone else... I probably do a ton of little things that most gym goers wouldn't think of but because I've been doing them for so long they are like second nature so I don't notice them. I'll just list some little things to make your workouts go smoother.

If you're loading a bar on the floor once you get to 225 (two 45s per side) grab a 5lbs plate and place it under the inside edge of the first 45

As soon as you finish a set if you need to adjust the weight do it right away

Breathe, you'll be surprised how many people hold their breath through a full set or the majority of a set, when they learn to breathe they'll be shocked at how much more weight they can move.

Always squeeze the bar, deads, whatever, squeeze the bar and tighten your forearms the added stability might surprise you.

Use your heart rate to judge rest breaks not the clock. If your heart is racing and you're not working on conditioning then take a few more deep breaths and let your body get back to normal. The clock should not dictate your rest time.

Pull up bars are everywhere just be careful with tree limbs as some aren't quite as strong as they look.

Before any heavy single you should have already done the lift 3 times in your head. Beat the weight in your mind before you get under the bar and half the battle is already won.

Don't get sucked into the lift of the month fever

Horse liniments are typically less expensive and more effective than those marketed for humans

* **What injuries have you dealt with? What are the injury risks that come with your athletic endeavors?**

Two ruptured disks in my back, none of those injuries were lifting related but were the ones that affected lifting the most.

Lifting injuries have been limited to muscle pulls/tears in my left hamstring and left pec. I've also had tendonitis in my elbows for years.

Any sport has risks and the more you put yourself out there the more likely you are to get hurt. I think you would be hard pressed to find anyone competing at a high level in any sport that hasn't had some injury

* **Any advice on how to deal with these injuries and risks?**

Know your limits and dance around the edge of them. When you do get hurt learn from it and take your down time as a period to regroup. Learn the difference between pressure

* **What are your favorite sports/fitness books/DVDs/websites?**

In days gone by the old Supertraining list

Books Steve Justa’s Rock Iron Steel Pavel Tsatsouline's Power to the People Randall Strossen's Super Squats. All of them for the same reason

DVDs are harder to pin down, Louie Simmons, etc. that I got a lot from. The one that's probably the most entertaining is Ronnie Coleman's The Unbelievable there are parts where he's moving freaky weights but you can't stop laughing because he spends his rest times hamming it up.

Here’s one of my favorite ones of me – http://i.imgur.com/lCJ5d.jpg

**Age?**

22

**Sex?**

Yes please. But seriously

**What sports or fitness activities are you involved in? Do you compete at any level?**

Powerlifting and rowing … powerlifting competitively and rowing on my own. I’ve gotten some records in different federations (USAPL and WABDL)

**What’s your story? When

I was quite the lazy person in high school, after the first week or two, I was addicted, so I handily won the bet. When I came back for spring semester, my workout partners became flaky, so come spring break, I looked for club sports I could join. I stumbled upon the powerlifting club and joined as soon as I got back. I’ve been doing that ever since. 

I joined the rowing team as a coxswain for a little while

**What are your current athletic or fitness-related goals?**

I’m coming off a 5-month powerlifting break (not by choice) so I’d like to get my old numbers back, and eventually, a 240lbs bench press. Last night I tried deadlifting for the first time in 5 months and hit 385lbs with room to spare (going for 407lbs next week, feeling good about it) … I was laughing about that the entire car ride home. Feels good man.

**What is your workout or training regimen?**

I change up my workout programs whenever I feel like I’m stalling or plateauing so I’ve tried a lot of different programs, custom programs and so on. Funnily enough, I’ve never done SS or SL.

* M – Deadlift / accessory
* T – Bench Press / accessory
* W – Cardio (endurance)
* R – Cardio (sprints)
* F – Squats / accessory
* S – Cardio (endurance)
* S – Rest

**What does your diet look like? Do you take any supplements?**

*Diet*

I’ve gone through a bunch of different diets, 1-1.5g/lb protein, and the rest carbs. My energy is great and I’m able to get a lot of variety in my diet.

*Supplements*

I tend to cycle my supplements to try and get the most benefit out of them. The most common ones I use are creatine, fish oils, multi-vitamin, BCAAs, and fiber.

**What have you achieved so far? What are your ‘numbers’ (times, etc)?**

*Powerlifting (at 123.5lbs)*

* Deadlift: 430lbs
* Bench: 210lbs
* Squat: 360lbs

*Other*

* Multiple rowing marathons
* 60km rowing ultra-marathon
* A couple running half-marathons

**What is your competition and/or training philosophy?**

Call me a nerd, there is no try.” I either go to the gym and give it everything I have, or I stay home and not waste my time in the gym. I also believe experience trumps an article or ‘study’. I know I might get some flak for saying that, but experience is personal as it happens to you, whereas a study or fitness article involves other people. I’m not saying I don’t read training articles or read up on studies, but if I had to choose between the two, I’d side more toward personal experience.

**What challenges do you face?**

There’s the whole ‘being short” thing, unlike weight). I tend to turn it around and make it a source of motivation, to show that I can lift like the best of ‘em, surprise them with strength and make them reevaluate their assumptions not only about myself, but others as well. Other than that, there’s the heart surgery thing.

**How do you motivate yourself?**

In all honesty, half for the lyrics. I’ve not found a better method to personally motivating myself. I’ve hit nearly 90% of my PRs listening to the same exact song, [Mortal Share by Insomnium](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WWtUm8BeGY). At the 0:24 mark, that moment, is when I go for the lift. Some of my recommended bands to listen to for lifting – Amon Amarth, Insomnium, Dark Tranquillity, Ensiferum

**How do you deal with naysayers and clashes between your lifestyle and that of your SO/friends/co-workers?**

A lot of time I’ll catch crap from friends or family about my diet, yeah, I’ll ease up. However, a lot of times, the people telling me to ‘live a little’ are the ones that are overweight, don’t exercise, bitch and moan about how they’re not in shape, so I just ignore them and remember my goals.

**What advice do you take

I take the good and ignore the bad, I’m not really sure. I guess I take advice from others where I can tell the advice they’re giving me has actually worked for them, bonus points if I’ve actually seen it happen. If they just mention a study or something, I’ll look into it and see if there’s merit, instead of just being a fitness fad or something.

**What are some training or diet-related things you know are true but cannot prove?**

*Training*

Sometimes it’s better to ignore the pain and push on (but be reasonable)
I may get crap for this, sometimes people can’t, but I feel like a lot of people haven’t pushed themselves hard enough or far enough to truly know the difference between “the wall” and their absolute limits. Rowing taught me that one all too well.

*Diet*

A balanced diet is more important than going to extremes (paleo, vlcd, etc). Those can definitely work for people, but they’re not for everybody.

Pancakes make great post-workout meals.

**Is there anything that you do differently in your sport/training/diet that you've never seen others do? Any other little innovations you don't mind sharing?**

In powerlifting, especially the endurance aspect. I find that I can lift heavy longer than others because my body is used to extended periods of exertion. Anecdotal? Yes, but it’s personal experience. Also, I tend to do a fair share of body weight exercises (my favorite being handstand pushups), so I get some odd looks at the gym for those, but oh well.

**What injuries have you dealt with? What are the injury risks that come with your athletic endeavors?**

I’ve been extremely lucky as I’ve never had a fitness-caused injury. However, but I was able to learn a lot about myself in that time and realized this is something I really want to do with my life.

**Any advice on how to deal with these injuries and risks?**

Patience, I’m not really sure what else I can say aside from be patience, remember your goals, and play is smart / safe.

**What are your favorite sports/fitness books/DVDs/websites?**

Anything related to powerlifting. Some resources and media I enjoy – leangains.com, Stronger, Faster”, “Powerlifting Unlimited”, bodybuilding.com forums.

1375200604.0,1jct8p,A model for motor neuron recruitment,pwoolf,32,6,12,"I've been reading through the paper [Relationship Between Firing Rate and Recruitment Threshold of Motoneurons in Voluntary Isometric Contractions](http://jn.physiology.org/content/104/2/1034.full)

I've translated the paper into a simple model below.

**A simplified model of muscle contraction**

Say we have 100 muscle fibers to work with.  All fibers are all of different strengths

* We sort these 100 fibers the force they can generate and annotate them as m1
* Each fiber has an energy efficiency, where alpha&gt;1.0.  As an example, lets say that alpha=2.0 (pulling a number from a hat).
* After contracting
* Contracting each fiber takes some amount of time (t1, getting fiber 16 to contract will require t16 seconds of brain control.  
* Contraction time (ti) is inversely proportional to force generated (mi).  Thus the strongest fibers have the shortest ti.
* Brain can signal to only 10 fibers at a time.  Once a signal is initiated


**Problem:**

How should our brain dynamically signal muscle to achieve a given contraction force with a maximum efficiency?

**Answer:**

* Always prefer the fast responding fibers (small ti) first

* If that force is sustained, until the brain's capacity is hit (10).

**Effect:**

*Low force:*

* Only so many low force fibers present (say m1-m10)

*High force:* 

* Only so many high force fibers present (say m90-100), but it pays a lag price).

*Intermediate force:*

* The full range of fiber forces can be used

**Implications:**

* Newbie strength gains are due to the motor cortex developing better programs for optimal fiber recruitment.  Much of this learning is essentially learning the force and firing time required for each fiber.

* After developing a pretty good motor neuron program
	- Shifting the identity of existing fibers (as far as that is possible).
	- Finding new fibers that are already present
	- Growing new fibers (say [here](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22802591))
	- Improving the motor neuron program
	- Performing the exercise in a different way.

* Performing exercises that are related

* Exercises at intermediate effort will tend to recruit the most fibers, but will develop more endurance (no surprise).

* Exercises at high effort (high force fibers) will recruit an intermediate number of fibers, but less endurance (no surprise).

* Exercising at low

**TLDR**

Don't just lift heavy or light

My question more-so lies among the actual weight lifting workout

I know the general correlation of 'more weight moved and/or more muscles activated == more calories burnt' acutely

That's the main question

- Does anybody know whether the 'pump' in a muscle has any relation to overall metabolic rate

- The supposed increase in fat burning from GH release from short rest periods; is this clinically significant enough to concern myself with? Especially considering the decrease in load that accompanies it?

- Anecdotally, bridge presses, glute bridges, KB swings) or (2) any exercise done in a prone or laying down position with ample weights, makes me sweat my balls off in little to no time. Is there any logic behind this that anybody can see? (I remember an old article talking about the metabolic effects of [hip swinging](http://www.t-nation.com/free_online_article/most_recent/the_metabolic_swing&amp;cr) in brief with an uncited reference to a Michigan study) Or is it possible that an increased cerebral blood pressure could be f-ing with my hypothalamus? (Also, I remember a phenomenon called 'hot pipes' that noted an increase in [thermogenesis](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/002432059190280O) that was a direct result of increased blood pressure; related?)

**Tl;Dr**

- Assuming I have diet, and both LISS and HIIT cardio down pat; however can I alter a workout schedule to increase fat burning without substantially decreasing the hypertrophic response to weightlifting?",,False,self,t5_2s9km,False,,

22 (23 in August), brown guy.

**What sports or fitness activities are you involved in? Do you compete at any level?**

I’ve always considered myself a runner first and foremost

**What’s your story? When

I have a bunch of medical problems, Graves @16. I was bit chubby as a kid, and not too active. Then I discovered if I pushed myself hard enough I could run faster than most people; I took it, and ran with it (heh, pun). I was otter mode skinny in high school, @5’9, ~130. When I found out I had Graves, and added lifting to my routine. I’ve been at it since

**Do you want to share any athletic or fitness-related goals, heights, etc)?**

Well there’s nothing advanced about this list but I hit a bunch of PRs this week (tested specifically for the spotlight): 

 * 145 Clean &amp; Jerk
 * 135 Press
 * 195 Clean 
 * 185x3 Bench 
 * 225 Front Squat 
 * 295 Back Squat 
 * 330 Deadlift 

I did 85 pound Tabata squats without puking after recently

I hit 1:00 on my 400m recently

I run a barely sub-5 mile

I run a sub-18 5K

My best half time was 1:34

**Goals:** I’ve never run a marathon (derp) and would like to run one before I start school again. A 315 squat would be nice before summer ends. I always joke that one day I’m going to run the [Self Transcendence 3100 Mile Race]( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-Transcendence_3100_Mile_Race). Honestly though, and he offered some great advice. He basically said if you really want to do something but are worried you can’t, just go ahead and attempt it anyway because at worst you’ll at least have tried. 

If I trained and ended up running even a 50 mile race one day because of it

**What is your workout or training regimen?**

I don’t have a set out fitness plan/training schedule, but stopped after I lost the weight. I don’t recommend anyone do 5 sessions of HIIT a day, it makes you want to curl up into a ball and die. I still do tabata squats though because they’re actually pretty fun.

**What does your diet look like? Do you take any supplements?
**

Food first:

I’ve started doing Cheat Mode recently on days when I lift and it’s actually a pretty cool way to eat. What I eat: I have what I call my ‘super slop’ which Ivary up a bit from day to day. I also make an awesome milk shake. I have “cheat” days or meals whenever I feel like it. I don’t restrict myself

*Shake:* 

3 cups 1% milk, 1 banana, 2-3 scoops whey (depending on whether or not it’s a workout day), 1 tbsp peanut butter, 1 tbsp almond butter, 1 tbsp hazelnut butter, 1/4 tsp cinnamon. ~130g carbs, ~40g fat

*Super Slop:*

2-3 large eggs, 1 tsp coconut oil, 1 cup spinach, 1 cup broccoli, 1/2 cup red onions, 1 green pepper, 1-2 cup mushrooms (&lt;3), turmeric, ~35g fat

The rest of my diet is rounded out with bacon, oranges, green tea, miso, and lime water. I sometimes have binge days of sashimi+teriyaki.

*Supplements* (the section everyone’s been waiting for?):

A crap load. I used to make my own multivitamin but I finally ran out and I don’t want to invest the effort into making one again

[I found a decent multivitamin](http://www.iherb.com/Source-Naturals-Life-Force-Multiple-180-Capsules/20835?at=0) (I take 1 pill, 1mg Vitamin K, 20mg Zinc, 250mg Magnesium, 2g ALCAR, 2g Beta-Alanine, 2g Taurine, 100mg R-ALA, 2g Inositol

I don’t take fish oil because I eat so much fish

If you’re going to supplement anything: 

Protein(if you don’t get enough)&gt;Vitamin D&gt;Fish Oil (if you don’t eat fish)&gt;Choline (low egg/fish consumption or endurance athletes)&gt;Vitamin K(if you don’t eat enough green veggies)&gt;everything else is my opinion.

I can see this one’s getting a lot of questions… I also put stuff into my shampoo to combat hair loss. My dad was pretty much bald by 30

Oh I also use light/dark therapy throughout the day because I’ve got a weird sleeping schedule and it helps keep me from getting depressed.

**What is your competition and/or training philosophy?**

I guess it’s: do what you enjoy

I can’t really think of any quotes right now

Also: make sure you’re eating properly and keeping your mobility

**What challenges do you face?**

Super-saiyan laziness (I promise I’ll update the Vitamin D article soon!), and everything to do with simply not working hard enough to reach my goals. Almost anything can be overcome with enough hard work, dedication, and know how.

**How do you motivate yourself?**

I set goals for myself and see if I can achieve them. If I don’t achieve my goal, that’s motivation enough.

**How do you deal with naysayers and clashes between your lifestyle and that of your SO/friends/co-workers?**

I’m lucky this way in that I don’t really have naysayers. Any time people have been wary of something I do

**What advice do you take

If it’s from you guys, maybe look up more information and take the advice if it still seems sound. I’ll ignore most bro-science (unless stated as such), but sometimes even then I’ll look it up and look around. 

I love learning

**What are some training or diet-related things you know are true but cannot prove?**

If every person ate a healthy diet it would eliminate 80%+ of the health problems in the world. 

*What’s a healthy diet Herman* you ask? If you’re eating a tin of sardines, and maybe a Vitamin D supplement daily, that’s a good start. (This is my advice to just about everyone whenever they have a diet related question because it’s almost always the answer).

**What injuries have you dealt with? What are the injury risks that come with your athletic endeavors?**

I’m double jointed in my shoulders

**Any advice on how to deal with these injuries and risks?**

1309149800.0,ia24x,Smart Crazy vs. Stupid Crazy:  Are Injuries A Necessary Part of Training?,Chr0me,29,2,30,"I showed up at Matt Kroc's house Saturday morning and rung his doorbell.  While I waited

Many people are familiar with Kroc rows, [a quad](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDQT_zbJ5Yg), torn his calf, a lat, and a pec, plus screwed up his back in numerous ways. He's also minus one nut due to cancer.  Yet he always comes back stronger and currently holds the world record for the 220 lb. weight class (2,551 lb. total lifted).  One of the things I wanted to learn from him was how he manages to do this.

His short answer was literally *""...nothing but a bump in the road. There is no secret to any of this.  What it takes is sustained hard work.""* He's completely accepted injuries (even major ones) simply as part of training and talked about them with the same caviler attitude that most of us mention a missed PR attempt.  He stressed that it's 100% mental and that many promising careers were cut short because the people just weren't mentally tough enough to come back from an injury.  But he also mentioned  Dave Tate warning him how his own body has paid the price over the years of playing the game hard.

I didn't get the impression that Kroc's obsessed though; he seemed to be able to turn the intensity on and off at will.  He's also very much a family guy and spent as much time talking about his kids as he did his powerlifting.  He's also into creative endeavors and has a smart business sense.  Kroc's success seemed to be the product of extreme discipline and a desire to see how far he can go.

I'm just wondering how many people here have a similar attitude?  Do you consider this reckless or is it necessary in order to test and grow your limits?  (And I do feel this a fair comparison.  Kroc isn't a genetically gifted lifter; he's naturally a slim guy who's simply worked his ass off and risked a lot to accomplish what he's done.  He's also not a pro-athlete and still trains by himself in a small home gym in his basement).",self,t5_2s9km,True,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/AdvancedFitness/comments/ia24x/smart_crazy_vs_stupid_crazy_are_injuries_a/

**Age?**

I am 22 turning 23 this summer in August.

**Sex?** 

Male

**What sports or fitness activities are you involved in? Do you compete at any level?**

 I am solely committed to the sport of rowing, cycling, running, nordic skiing. Rowing is where I compete.

**What’s your story? When

First year of university I was looking at all the clubs and teams and I saw the rowing club recruiting. They had a sign that said, but I was tall so that helped. I rowed novice for a year, then rowed recreationally for a year and a half. Halfway through my third year I started to become more serious, training twice a day, and now here I am.

**What are your current athletic or fitness-related goals?**

My number one goal is a gold medal at the 2016 summer Olympics in any boat.

**What is your workout or training regimen?**

I am used to doing 2x a day, 6x a week a are minimum on the water. Usually those are 1x a day and in the mornings. Then I will do weights 3x a week and the remaining workouts are either more rowing or dry land training (biking, running, pilots, cross country skiing).

**What does your diet look like? Do you take any supplements?** 

Given my BMR and my fitness requirements I need to eat about 6

**What have you achieved so far? What are your ‘numbers’ (times, etc)?**

I placed 3rd at my first attempt at nationals last year in the Single. My best 2K is around 6:20. Not great

**What is your competition and/or training philosophy?**

Make every workout count. Every workout you do is making you better

**What challenges do you face?** 

My biggest problem is that I have never been in a crew of guys. So I am always rowing by myself and I never have anyone faster than myself in local training to push myself. Plus when you are up at 0430 every day to row in every weather condition it takes a lot of motivation.

**How do you motivate yourself?**

I have two sources of motivation. The first is my coach, then someone else is just getting better than me.""

**How do you deal with naysayers and clashes between your lifestyle and that of your SO/friends/co-workers?**

I don't really have any nay-sayers. I tell everyone my goal because that way if I give up I will have to tell all these people why I stopped rowing. My only real issues is that I am in the military so sometimes it is hard to workout 2x a day when I am on a military course where I am not even in a city where they have a rowing club. My SO is a national water-polo athlete so she knows exactly what it takes to get to the elite level. She often does workouts with me and I met her through rowing.

**What advice do you take

I completely ignore advice on r/fitness

**What are some training or diet-related things you know are true but cannot prove?** 

Too much protein is actually bad for you. Typically anything in excess is never good

**Is there anything that you do differently in your sport/training/diet that you've never seen others do? Any other little innovations you don't mind sharing?** 

I don't really have any tricks in my training because my training plan is basically to put in a million miles. I guess my only trick is when I start a race. When we start a race we are sitting still at full catch with the blades in the water waiting for the signal to go. This puts you in a very tippy situation so my tip is that I ""back"" the boat to move it in the other direction so when I hear

**What injuries have you dealt with? What are the injury risks that come with your athletic endeavors?** 

The most common injury in my sport is fractured ribs because elite athletes work so hard that their muscles get stronger than their bones and you breath so hard you can easily fracture them. My injuries have been limited to bursitis on the knee and a hyper-mobile L5-S1 joint. The first came from over training when I wasn't used to 2x a day

**Any advice on how to deal with these injuries and risks?** 

Injuries suck

**What are your favorite sports/fitness books/DVDs/websites?** 

[RowingCanada](http://www.rowingcanada.org/home) is what I go to for a lot of national development information. [Row2k](http://www.row2k.com/) has a lot of random rowing information and big regatta results. [RowingNews](http://www.rowingnews.com/) has a lot of good rowing news and articles.

**Anything else you want to add?** 

Never just take any fitness and nutritional advice from randoms off the internet, r/fitnesscirclejerk is an awesome subreddit if you want to make fun of r/fitness.

1295406195.0,f4uk2,"Why I think walking lunges (or forward lunges) are not useful at all and should be avoided altogether:
",6,65,http://www.reddit.com/r/AdvancedFitness/comments/f4uk2/why_i_think_walking_lunges_or_forward_lunges_are/,"I was reading [this](http://charlespoliquin.com/ArticlesMultimedia/Articles/Article/449/A_Few_Words_with_Weightlifting_Coach_John_Broz.aspx) interview by John Broz (of Pat Mendes fame) and he mentions that he hates lunges because it’s an unnatural movement – you never see a child lunge to pick up something. His exact quote is “I consider the lunge the worst exercise ever invented [..] Because it’s not a natural movement. You never see a child lunge to pick something up – they squat. What happens with this movement is that you often end up using a weight that is too heavy and you end up twisting your knee and becoming injured, especially with women because of the angle of the knee joint. I told my old girlfriend never to do lunges, and one day she sneaked into the women’s only section of the gym and did them heavy as I just described. She ended up tearing a meniscus and was in a leg brace for seven months, and it’s much

This got me thinking, and I feel that something that anything you can’t learn fast is not a good idea to be performing, especially weighted.  So I’m going to pick it apart and try and prove that forward lunging is not a good idea.
Now I must mention that I’m mostly talking about the forward lunge, something that cannot be safely done on pure single leg exercises like pistols.

From my observations, skating and volleyball. BUT, in all of these sports, the angle of the torso is always at ~45 degrees. The torso is never straight up. The only time the torso is straight up when on the feet is at the top speed of a sprint. Look at [this](http://sportsblog.projo.com/bolt0819.jpg) picture of Usain Bolt starting his sprint. The torso is angled forward, putting more stress on the hip flexors and quads at this point, and when attaining [top speed](http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2009/04/20/article-0-02A68C8A000005DC-367_306x423.jpg), the torso shifts into more of an upright angle which allows the glutes to take over the movement for maximum backwards drive. While the lunge will be beneficial for top speed movement, it’s way more related to sprinting. In fact Brett Contreras mentioned that after adding glute bridges to his football players’ regimen

This article is not for the fencers and martial artists, two of the more dominant sports in terms of lunging. Speaking as a volleyball player, I can safely say that there is almost no time in which you resemble the position of a forward lunge, [you always lunge forward and bend at the waist to get the ball](http://content5.videojug.com/ec/ec2a9381-c334-e270-31a6-ff0008c9d4d8/how-to-forearm-pass-a-volleyball.WidePlayer.jpg?v2). Of course there are exceptions, but this is the norm. In skating too, [the body is in a forward lean](http://83.166.161.30/images/uploads/main_images/Speed-Skating.jpg), thus heavily recruiting the posterior chain.

Look at this video of a [forward lunge](http://www.ehow.com/video_2360533_forward-lunge-training-exercises.html). I’d say that’s a pretty standard technique, everything done in the weight room trains the deceleration component. That’s what an eccentric contraction is. You squat down slowly, and that’s training deceleration, it’s done so that the body doesn’t slam into the floor. I don’t think you need any more specific training on how to slow down, the body is smart enough to know how to slow down to stop damage to itself. It’s like taking football players and beating the hell out of them, because that’s what happens in a game. The major players in slowing down are the hamstrings. Train them with a 5 second eccentric tempo, and you’ll be golden.

Another common thing I hear is from Mike Boyle. He states that lunges (and Bulgarian split squats) are superior to squatting because his athletes can push 200lbs in a split squat while they can’t squat 400. Two answers to that, the lunge is not a strict single leg movement. The back leg is helping with the movement, even if it’s very little. It helps in stabilization and adds a bit of power to the movement. If you want a true one leg movement, try a pistol or a step-up.

I must stress that I am in no way bashing the reverse lunge, and so it’s pretty specific to sports. 

What I wrote above is opinion, I’m wrong. Thanks for reading.

This time

____
But before we start...

***WARNING: This is PURELY ANECDOTAL (eg- Broscience-ish stuff, ""fuck you."" ***
____


***Odd Implement (""Slab"") Press***

**What you will need:**

* 
1 [Loading Pin](http://ironmind-store.com/12-Standard-Plate-Loading-Pin-Without-Clip/productinfo/1313/) (often found on a ""[rolling thunder](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAdykOiPFTo)"" or other grip trainers) You're gym probably has one

* Bumper Plates (at minimum 2)

* 2(!) Spring Clips (alligator clips won't work.)

* 1 garbage bag

**The Setup:**

Stack desired bumper weights on to the Loading Pin. If you only have 2 bumpers

Now that this is done, and shove that down on top as well. [The finished production should look like this.](http://i.imgur.com/C8KHR.png) 

**The Technique:**

For the technical folks out there, Kegs, Etc. Pretty much anythings that's weird or big)

* Get a grip on the object and deadlift/Stiff leg deadlift the object over your knees

* Squat down (ATG) resting the object on your knees

* Stand and clean object up...

...OR

**The Purpose:**

It's an OHP done with an unstable object. I could go on about how it helps stabilization, but this Odd Lifts edition is about FUN, so give it a shot and have a blast.

**Protip:** 

If you master the lift

**Video Example:**

I had such a good time doing these

[Abes 140x5 Slab Press](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbmEwU6zdXQ)

________

***Hand Over Hand Rope Curl (???)*** 

**You'll need:**

* 1 Ship Rope

* 1 Kettlebell (best option) or Heavy DB

* a Bench/Ledge/Plyo Boxes/ etc. Something to stand on that will get you at least 2ft off the ground (higher you go the harder it is)

**Set Up:**

Tie one end of the rope around the KB/DB

**The Tech**

Grip the rope so your fists are stacked on top of each other, fists should be touching on each ""rep"") The curling motions shouldn't be more than 5-6 inches. When the knot reaches your hands, lower the weight in the same fashion. When the weight touches the floor that is **1 REP** Try to get 3-5x5.

**The Variations / Purpose**

* Keeping your fists and elbows close to your body will give you an awesome Bi/Grip workout.

* Pushing your fist away from your body and using a more obtuse angle in your arms will give you more of a Shoulder/Grip workout.

* **But

*Examples:* 

""Your hands are supposed to be touching you fuckin bitch-made cheat!""

""God

""*'OW

...and finally

""Hm

**Warning**: you will be subject to the same ridicule when it's your turn to stand on the podium of shame.

This is pretty much based on intuition and one data point though.

So

My direct arm work has been fairly sparse; I've done weighted chins over a couple of years and very little curling. The resulting numbers from that are: 

280lb TOTAL x 3 weighted chin

85lb x 4 straight barbell curl

Is that (as I think) disproportionate? Or at least an indicator that getting strong at weighted chins is not as effective as is commonly thought for strengthening the biceps?",self,t5_2s9km,True,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/AdvancedFitness/comments/in57j/weighted_chins_as_biceps_work_yay_or_nay/

**Age and Sex?** 24yrs 8mo

**What sports or fitness activities are you involved in? Do you compete at any level?** 

Current: 

* Danzan Ryu Jujutsu- 9yrs

* Powerlifting- 1-2yrs

* Highland Games- just started

Past:

* Muso Jikiden Eishin Ryu Iaijutsu- 2yrs

* Ice Hockey- 3yrs

**What’s your story? When

This story might make more sense if you read the part about injuries first. They’ve done a lot to guide my path... 

A little less than a decade ago, I broke my clavicle and subsequently had to focus entirely on the healing side of Danzan Ryu, which helped tremendously. 

I enrolled in massage therapy school as soon as I could take falls again. I’ve been licensed and practicing for 4 years now

Initially

Plus

**What are your current athletic or fitness-related goals?** 

I want a 600 lbs deadlift and 500 lbs raw squat at less than 240 lbs bodyweight, and I want to successfully turn the caber at least once at the Lehi Highland Games next month.

**What is your workout or training regimen?** 

5/3/1 for squat and deadlift, and throwing heavy objects and pushing cars about once a week.

**What does your diet look like? Do you take any supplements?** 

My diet looks like... food? I just finished finals, eggs, milk, cottage cheese, etc. I use a multivitamin, B-complex, fish oil, 10g leucine

I also regularly use balms and liniments to boost recovery. I think of them as external supplements. Zheng Gu Shui, and PhysioBalm are my mainstays.

**What have you achieved so far? What are your ‘numbers’ (times, etc)?** 

It’s hard to quantify achievements in jujutsu, 455 squat (wrapped), 260 bench press, 175 overhead press. All are recent except the bp and ohp, which were a few months back before I irritated my shoulder again. Hopefully I’ll have more to add to this after this summer.

**What is your competition and/or training philosophy**? 

I’ll have to channel Jim Wendler on this one: “Don’t train for fat loss. Train to be a motherfucker.” Just replace ‘fat loss’ with any short-sighted superficial goal and that’s me.

One more that I picked up from one of my brothers as he was prepping for dive school: “Make civil the mind and savage the body.”
But both of those leave some gaps. They’re good mantras, spirit, and environment. They are all intimately linked and any one can guide and influence the others. I believe a strong body reflects a strong mind, a flexible body reflects a flexible mind. There’s a lot I can say about this, but the more I say the more likely it I am to just complicate the issue... You can think of it like doing compound lifts instead of isolation movements, only with more than just muscle and sinew involved.

**What challenges do you face?** 

I am my own worst enemy. My body is prone to breaking down. I have chronic tendinitis throughout most of my body and I have to train smart to avoid making it flare up. A result of this is that I am very intimately aware of every part of my body

Being a student, or training and I have very little spare time or spare cash to put toward preparing healthful meals as often as I should. My wife works full time, but thanks to her I usually get at least one decent meal a day. (I’m not a misogynist, just busy.)

**How do you motivate yourself?** 

Curiosity accounts for a lot. Vicarious accomplishment through my clients helps some. I lift so I can have quantifiable progress in some aspect of my life.

**What advice do you take

I listen to my body and to people with similar goals but much more experience. This rules out the vast majority of the internet.

**What are some training or diet-related things you know are true but cannot prove?** 

Most of what I “know” I feel should be common sense, the stuff...

Whether training should emphasize mobility or stability in a joint depends on its position

Some massage therapy works. Some is a waste of time and money. Sports massage isn’t a specific modality. It’s any kind of massage done to benefit physical performance. Different approaches work better on different types of athletes and different injuries or imbalances. Most of the massage research that hits the news is either very poorly performed or very poorly reported

ART is not the be-all, NMT, PNF, MET, pin-and-stretch, structural integration/Rolfing, and every other “high-end” modality.

They’re all tools with specific applications. That’s why more integrative approaches like Russian Sports Massage form the foundation of my treatments. I can incorporate any specific techniques I need to while still working toward an overall goal to improve the performance of every system of the body.

**What injuries have you dealt with? What are the injury risks that come with your athletic endeavors?** 

Let’s see...  

* Fractured left clavicle in a bad fall from kesa nage

* Loss of proprioception and pain led to multiple small tears to rotator cuff and possible SLAP lesion from stuff like shoveling snow. 

* Unaware of soft tissue injuries until the next day when the swelling was obvious. 

* Ongoing problem that interferes with lifting.

* Deep bone bruise to medial condyle of left femur

* Dislocated or sprained all of my toes multiple times

* Stress fractures in both ulnas due to severe periostitis at origin of flexor digitorum profundus. Probably from a combination of increased volume on deadlifts

* Chronic tendinitis across most major joints. 

* Dislocated three ribs and subluxation of associated vertebrae

**Any advice on how to deal with these injuries and risks?** 

I just listen to my body. It sounds simple

Lots of soft-tissue work coupled with rehab exercises and internal/external supplements. I occasionally make use of e-stim and ultrasound as well.

**What are your favorite sports/fitness books/DVDs/websites?** 

I’ll have a bunch to list here and the list will grow with time

**Anything else you want to add?**

[Here](http://imgur.com/a/SSbDj#0) is a link to the tests. Personal data removed from the results for confidentiality although each participant signed an informed consent.

**Bodybuilder-Keto**: At low intensities he is already burning more CHO than Fats and that is at 4-4.5mph 0%grade. As his heart rate increases his RER value reaches pure carbohydrate at 1.00 and he begins to utilize protein as a substrate although it is almost entirely CHO. &gt;1.05 RER usually signifies lactate threshold which means that he isn't going to last much longer or go very far during the test. He was always burning more carbohydrate than fat (percentage utilization) so there wasn't an optimal HRrange to prescribe cardiorespiratory endurance training as anything he can accomplish would be an improvement.

**CrossFit style athlete no dietary restrictions**: This test is on a moderately balanced individual in terms of fitness. He does moderate amounts of cardiorespiratory exercise in comparison to crossfit style resistance training. RER of .77 shows fat being the predominant substrate at low levels of intensity where the balance of CHO/FAT is achieved at 82% of HRmax. He ended with a relative value of 55.6ml/kg/min which is pretty high percentile.

**HIIT low-CHO diet** Collegiate cheerleader performs high intensity interval training or p90x style workouts. Here optimal endurance training HR is also on the low side ~75%HRmax for a 50/50blend of substrate usage. She gets into high CHO usage pretty quickly and at low intensities although her body wants to run on CHO the low carbohydrate diet might impede performance if there is no substrate available to use.

**Endurance Athlete High-CHO** The significant part of this test is that the endurance athlete burns fat as a primary substrate all the way into the 5th minute of the test where as the other previous subjects went mostly CHO after the 1-3rd minutes and still burned fat until the last 2 stages in comparison to the other tests. The body builder stopped using fats 5 minutes into the test and the CF/HIIT tapered off with 4-5 stages left to go.

**Second Endurance Athlete** Sample times were twice as frequent in this report which gives more specific data and allows greater precision for training zones. This athlete used fat as his dominant fuel source for the first 7 stages and didn't go completely carbohydrate until stage 12. Ideal training zone for max CHO/Fat combined useage would be 165bpm or at an RER of .85

**sedentary obese standard bike protocol** HR wasn't recorded on the data sheet for this test. Notable data are the RER mix being mostly CHO from the start and fat metabolism gone at 8 minutes into the ten minute test. VO2max was achieved at minute 10 and the last ten minutes were to show EPOC and the return to resting VO2 which is typically ~3.5ml/kg/min. The most interesting aspect is the EPOC period where the subject continued to burn strictly carbohydrate for 8 minutes after achieving VO2max during passive recovery signifying extremely high lactate levels as demonstrated by the RER value &gt;1.05",self,t5_2s9km,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/AdvancedFitness/comments/lsjua/graded_exercise_test_results_vo2max_tests/

[August 2010


* ** Age?**


I’ll be thirty-six in July.

* ** Sex?**


Extremely male.

* **What sports or fitness activities are you involved in? Do you compete at any level?**

Currently I lift weights

* **What’s your story? When


As a teenager, alcohol, cigarettes and acid in a short space of time and pretty much forgot about sports, although I stayed in reasonably good shape. 

After a fairly horrific injury under the influence of heroin in my early twenties

In mid-2009, I pulled on some pants I’d bought only six weeks earlier to replace the last pair that I’d outgrown, and the button burst off and flew across the room.   I decided to get into shape. 

I dragged my wife’s elliptical trainer in front of the TV, since I was snacking in the evenings like a madman.  I got down from 235 to 185, bought a bench and some weights, and was hooked pretty fast on lifting.  The only breaks since then have been when the gym is closed. I’m currently 215, but leaner than I was at 185.

* ** What are your current athletic or fitness-related goals?**

I’m mainly working towards bigger barbell lifts and faster sprints. I’d like my 100m time to get down under 11s and continue to add weight to my major lifts.

* ** What is your workout or training regimen? Feel free to provide as much detail as you want.**

I vary each workout, I rotate four workouts: 
* Quads &amp; back
* Shoulders
* Chest &amp; arms
* Core
Most workouts consist of one major lift, 12x1) at close to max, then between one and six assistance lifts, various rep schemes depending on how much gas is left in the tank after the main lift. I use the assistance lifts to try out different ideas I read about, so they’re fairly inconsistent, anywhere from 3x5 to 10x10 depending on mood, energy
Previously

* **What does your diet look like? Do you take any supplements?**

Supplements are the usual boring stuff – whey, creatine.

My diet has two modes, all hours of the day and night. GOMAD, 4,000 calorie post-workout binges, fast food, good food, awful food, then I do intermittent fasting on an 18/6 or 20/4 basis. No calories until after my workout
[Here]( http://imgur.com/a/tkw91#mX2NJ) are examples of a normal lunch

* **What have you achieved so far? What are your ‘numbers’ (times, etc)?**

Back in the day, Deadlift: 495lbs, Bench: 247.5lbs. 

* **What is your competition and/or training philosophy?**

Outside the gym, and want to a healthy and strong husband and father. In the gym, it’s PR or ER, basically. I’m there to break records, and work until I drop. 
I do seek out as much information about what I’m doing as possible; I’ve known too many people who worked hard

* **What challenges do you face?**

I’m a late starter, 

Being married to someone with very different dietary habits is challenging – less so during semester when we only eat together every couple of days. 

* **How do you motivate yourself?**

It’s not much of a challenge

* **How do you deal with naysayers and clashes between your lifestyle and that of your SO/friends/co-workers?**

It’s harder in Australia, drinking beer and watching TV.  They’re all eagerly waiting for me to return, fat from the American lifestyle :D


* **What advice do you take

Much like silverhydra said last week, or give myself enough recovery time. I guess the advice I ignore is “slow down, old man, or you’ll hurt yourself”.

* **What are some training or diet-related things you know are true but cannot prove?**

I don’t have the physiology or dietetic grounding to prove anything; I guess for controversial opinions,000 calorie a day diets.

* **Is there anything that you do differently in your sport/training/diet that you've never seen others do?**

I do a lot of conditioning work, it’s three lifting days (most weeks), three conditioning days (two for sprints and one for weight complexes) and one for endurance cardio (10k run). 


* **Any other little innovations you don't mind sharing?**

Familiarity is important for peak performance. If you study in the room where the exam will take place, I’m wearing the same top, using the same plates, holding the same bar, listening to the same part of the same track on my headphones, at the same volume and standing in front of the same rack. Find the exact conditions you last set a record in, and maybe you’ll find the same headspace and attitude

* **What injuries have you dealt with? What are the injury risks that come with your athletic endeavors?**

Apart from the issues with my leg mentioned above, and generally hurts and frustrates me.  I also have recurring tendinitis in my right wrist, which hasn’t flared up in a while but has taken me out of action more than once.

* **Any advice on how to deal with these injuries and risks?**

Patience. Maybe you have to miss a few days lifting, you could end up taking a year off.

* **What are your favorite sports/fitness books/DVDs/websites?**

Fittit, off the top of my head.

* **Anything else you want to add?**

I was a chubby, crippled guy in his mid-thirties a little over eighteen months ago…all you have to do is a little reading, and a lot of hardening the fuck up, and you’ll get to wherever you want to be soon enough.

1334937982.0,sju4s,[Race Report] 2012 Boston Marathon,flictonic,27,3,19,"**Stats and Intro**

25, Walk around above 180

This was my 7th marathon but my first time running Boston.  I qualified last summer with a time of 3:04.  My previous PR was a 3:10 in 2008.  I ran Boston in 3:54 and change.

I don't know how many of you followed this year but the weather was forecast to be one of the hottest Boston Marathon's in history with a high close to 90F. The BAA was scrambling to make arrangements and even offered registration deferment (unprecedented) to encourage people to not run.

*****

**Training**

I was pretty happy with the training plan that I developed for last summer's PR marathon.  I ran M Tu W F Sa with a speed workout on Tu, I made the decision, shortly after qualifying, to take Boston easy and allow myself to take my lifts up and maybe gain a little weight.  My training plan this time around was run on M Th Sa with a speed workout on Th and a long run on Saturday.  I also cross trained on Wednesday, usually on the bike or elliptical.  For lifting, I stuck with 5/3/1 BBB with squats on M, bench on Tu, and press on F.  This worked out well for all lifts except the squat (which I ended up having to 90% deload) and I even hit a deadlift PR for the r/weightroom contest.  

My long run progression was like this: 10, 16, 13, 18, 20, 13, 20, 8.

There is a lot of debate about taking your long run over 20 miles.  Had I been going for an aggressive time

*****

**Leading up to the race**

I live in Boston so that made matters pretty easy.  I went to the expo on Saturday to pick up my race packet.  Other than that

For nutrition, soup, pork chops and kale.  The night before the race I ate the same thing but just increased my bread portion.  For supplements, I stopped creatine a few weeks before the race, upped my fish oil to 6 pills a day, and continued to take ZMA, D

*****

**Race Morning**

I woke up a 5 AM, and some bread and butter.  I popped 3 fish oil pills, and stretched a bit.  I then made my way down to the Boston Common to catch one of the provided buses that take runners to the start in Hopkington.  Everything went smoothly and I was at the start around 7:30.  There, I laid down and relaxed in the sun, munching on the saltines and Nutella that I made the night before and sipping on a 64 oz Gatorade.  

At this point

At 9:15

*****

**The Race**

[Splits](http://i.imgur.com/V5nCQ.png)

The start is about 80 degrees.  I made the decision to start at the pace that I was training to run the race in (7:45) and slow down when/if my body needed to.  I was seeded for Wave 1

Everything started smoothly and I ran the the first mile a little fast because it was downhill.  I was running at a slightly slower pace than the people around me so I didn't have to worry about weaving around people.  I made the decision to hit every aid station along the way on principal (in the past I would skip the crowded ones even if I was thirsty to not lose time).  I grabbed both Gatorade and water

Everything continued to go well and I felt pretty decent, I could feel the heat and lack of shade starting to get to me and the Newton hills starting at mile 16 began to worry me a bit.  This was also when I started seeing a few people collapse on the side of the road.

I approached the first hill at a gradually decreasing pace and ended up walking some of it.  This repeated itself all the way through heartbreak.  Coming out of heartbreak I was really starting to feel hot and worn down.  There was almost no shade to be found and at this point the Gatorade and water was far too warm to offer any cooling effect.  I chugged along, I had never noticed before.  Mentally, these were tough and I succumbed to walking up them.  Approaching Kenmore Square, about two miles out, I knew I had friends coming up so I made it a point not to walk anymore.  I also knew that I was coming dangerously close to 4 hours, a mark that I had only gone past on my first marathon.  I finished as strong as I could, getting support from groups of friends.  Turning the corner onto Boylston was tough though.  It was a stretch that I had walked down many times before but it never seemed as long as it was that day.  I finished under 3:55.  The temperature at the finish line was 87F.

*****

**Recovery**

I actually felt pretty damn good after this race.  Usually I am really sick for a day or two but this time around I felt great (probably because the reduced pace and the extra effort I made to stay hydrated).

I met up with my mom and gf and took the T back to my apartment.  I took a cold shower and munched on some saltines for a bit before I laid down.  I laid down for about 3 hours but was starting to really feel really hungry.  I actually felt good enough to get up and go out to eat so we went for sushi and froyo.  I then met up with some friends for celebratory beer and we watched the Bruins (GO Bs).  This week I've obviously been sore but nothing has bothered me too badly.  I plan to get back to lifting and some light running on Monday.

1306518761.0,hlocg,"""Odd"" Lifts that have made all the difference. ",abeswastaken,27,3,18,"Over the past 12-13 years I've spent in the weight room (10 of which spent ""working out"" and the last 3 actually ""training"") I've picked up a few uncommon ""Odd"" lifts that I believe have powered me through plateaus and technical hang ups. 

** *WARNING: This is PURELY ANECDOTAL (eg- Broscience-y backed up by above average numbers in the weight room). If you want science and studies

**Two Bar Lever Deadlift / Grappler Deadlift**

What you will need:

* 2 barbells
* 2 heavy (&gt;70) dumbbells
* Straps (or not

The Setup:

Now if you actually had a Grappler, 
Place the Two dumbbells side by side against a wall. Slide the 2 barbells under each DB handle. Load up the Weights on the other side

The Technique:

- Stand Between the two Bars with your toes roughly 1-2 inches away from the plates.

- Strap in (or simply grip) all the way up to the Barbell Sleeve.

- Drop into your deadlift position (assuming you do not dead sumo)

- Now here is where things get a little different, you must load your heels, and thrust your hips forward. This should put you at a slight angle leaning back (THIS IS WHY STRAPS ARE HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!)

Purpose:

This movement helps the lifter stay off their toes, the angle and anchoring of the movement would lock their body into the down position. The most important thing i learned in this movement was how to push my hips through. This is the hardest idea to teach someone on the deadlift. The hips do not come up, they push through. 
Also for the bodybuilder out there

[Here is a video of it being done properly](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eiMPBhGSZS8&amp;feature=player_detailpage#t=21s)

_______________

**Banded OHP**

You'll need:

* 1 Barbell
* 2 bands
* Power Rack with Pins or Heavy DBs (&gt;70)

Set Up:

Loop the Bands around the pins in the rack

Purpose:

If you spent anytime in the weight room, while maintaining a straight back. Often I see people do what they call a OHP, when really they are doing a weird standing incline bench (from hell.) The bands do not allow this. You must shot your head through in order to finish the lift. I credit this variation for boosting my OHP PR from 275 to 315 over a few months.

Wow

**Age?** 43

**Sex?** Male

**What sports or fitness activities are you involved in? Do you compete at any level?**

I lift weights at my local YMCA, mostly using High Intensity Interval Training. I do not compete.

**What’s your story? When

I've run on and off for over a decade, and I felt great doing it.

When I turned 42 (last year), and frankly the people who were arguing for Starting Strength had very strong arguments, didn't overstate their case, and backed it up with references. I decided to give it a whirl, started with Strong Lifts, swapped to Starting Strength in a few months, an have enjoyed it since.

**What are your current athletic or fitness-related goals?**

I'm still a weight lifting novice. I have a workweight of 1.2x BW for my squats
You'll notice that by any objective consideration involving other fitness people

**What is your workout or training regimen?**

I adhere to 3x a week in the weight room, 30 sec on, 30 sec off) when I can, and it doesn't negatively impact my energy level in the weight room.

**What does your diet look like? Do you take any supplements?**

I just finished 3 months trying to drink as much milk as possible (usually 1 qt a day, with 180gm protein (I weigh 180lbs now, with, I estimate, 18% fat), and the rest in carbs and fat. I take the following supplements: 5000 IU Vitamin D; 3 tsp Omega 3 fish oil; 1.5 tsp Beta Alanine. 1 tsp creatine.

**What have you achieved so far? What are your ‘numbers’ (times, etc)?**

 * Squat: 215lbs 3x5
 * Deadlift: 270lbs 1x5 (no chalk
 * Bench: 140lbs 3x5
 * OHP: 100lbs 3x5 (actually
quite done it).
 * Cleans: 105lbs 3x5

And

**What is your competition and/or training philosophy?**

There is really only one criterion for success: whether or not I am happy. If I am not happy

**What challenges do you face?**

I have no significant challenges. I am aware of a gap between my potential and my fitness level

**How do you motivate yourself?**

I lead a busy life

And to do that, this is as good as it gets."" And then I get myself out there.

**How do you deal with naysayers and clashes between your lifestyle and that of your SO/friends/co-workers?**

I have no such naysayers. I am not partnered up. My friends let me do what I want, with the exception of my brothers (who are a bit like me: they don't like to be told what to do by others, and prefer to discover their own thing, on their own). If I were to get a direct question about it, I always, always play it off: ""Oh, thanks -- nice of you to notice. You got those TPS reports for me? Today's Tuesday you know.""

**What advice do you take

I accept form advice which is backed up by my own internet research. I ignore any advice from anyone who, it should be noted, is not remarkably much).

**What are some training or diet-related things you know are true but cannot prove?**

 * I loose awesome weight running HIIT
 * There is a fitness level at which one becomes physically attractive, and your bodyfat %. And I wish to god some researcher would work these out. It would save a lot of arguing on /r/fitness, and a lot of uncertainty among novices.

**Is there anything that you do differently in your sport/training/diet that you've never seen others do? Any other little innovations you don't mind sharing?**

Well, I'm pretty sure that I made major gains on all the major lifts by having pre-strengthened stabilizers.

**What injuries have you dealt with? What are the injury risks that come with your athletic endeavors?**

I've had two annoying injuries in the past year. The first came from skiiing: where I twisted my right ankle. This made placing much weight on it difficult, you know the risks, idiot.

The second I have now: My right forearm muscle -- not tendon -- pains when I grip when it is extended. I'm confident I got this from over-pulling a deadlift. I have rested it 3 weeks (almost certainly too much, but it hasn't recovered. I'm going back into the gym today, and it's going to have to suck it up, it's go time.

**Any advice on how to deal with these injuries and risks?**

I had never, knew what I was getting myself into, and am fairly sure that it was caused because my bindings were too tight, that the ski-shop guy didn't fully get that I was a ski novice. Lesson learned: skiing's fricking dangerous, don't trust anyone to set your bindings right: learn your numbers and tell them what they are. If you go at all.

**What are your favorite sports/fitness books/DVDs/websites?**

I don't have any favorite fitness books, which is perfect for the novice. My favorite sport, for me to participate in, is running, alone. I don't have any favorite competitive sports, because I don't really know how to moderate competition: I either want to destroy and humiliate the competition, or, I simply hate myself -- unless I can convince myself not to care at all about the outcome

**Anything else you want to add?**

- Coffee before working out is probably the best thing ever

- If you don't have the mobility to back squat properly

- Doing a couple of high tuck jumps before going for a heavy squat or deadlift will make the lift seem a lot easier. This is not to be confused with complex training

- As much as you can

- Crushing the bar immediately makes you stronger. Try it

- Towel pullups are the shit. Enough said.

- The lift that I see most people mess up on is the clean. If you have ANY doubt about whether you're doing it right

- The best ab exercise (aside from gymnastic progressions) is the front squat. You won't be asking for any upper or lower ab exercises when you can front squat 300lbs.

- If you have stalled on your deadlift or squat

- If you think you are stable

**What's your story?** 

There's not too much to say on this

 * From the age of about 11 to 16 I trained in Tae Kwon Do (Blue belt
 * About the same time I was playing Hockey at a fairly low level. I was never that good at anything other than hitting the ball hard.     
 * From 14 to 19 I was obsessed with mountain biking. I've competed in one 4X race, but for the most part I wasn't very good at landing things.    
 * Went to uni at 18, and that was all we ever did when we worked out. For the second and third years I lived with Bro No.2, who also curled. I got bored of this, found *bodybuilding.com/exercise*, and would use the 1' York weight set to do things I found in there. Then about a year and a half ago I found Fittit, and started learning more about what I was doing and why.    
 * Started running 5 - 10km most evenings for a few months
 * Then I torrented Convict Conditioning
 * At the start of this year I finally bought myself a proper set of weights

&amp;nbsp;

**Do you want to share any athletic or fitness-related goals

**Deadlift** - 185kg/410lbs

**What is your workout or training regimen?** 

I probably overestimate my ability to do so, and 5/3/1 for the main lifts) but most of the time I just go and lift progressively heavier things until I can't anymore. I've only recently got far enough out of my noob gains that it doesn't work as a training method, although I'm not saying it's a good one.

My current plan is outlined in my BTFC post

I'm currently trying to overtrain by doing heavy triples/doubles/singles on all lifts

 * **Day A:** Squats, Deadlifts, Accessory work   
 * **Day B:** Oly lifts, Accessory work

Working up in roughly 5-10% 1RM increments

There are a few short term targets I have in my mind: 1000lb club (930ish at the moment)

&amp;nbsp;

**What does your diet look like? Do you take any supplements?** 

Diet is currently an 16:8 Intermittent Fast Bulk. I love cooking and love eating even more

I'm a bit of a supplement whore

**General**: Fish Oil
**Fasting**: ECA Stack
**Preworkout**: [Homemade Stack](http://www.reddit.com/r/Supplements/comments/ii20z/homemade_preworkout_supplement_just_want_to_run/) - It only contains the basics for now (5000mg Creatine, 1000mg Choline/DMAE mix, 1000mg Taurine, 1000mg Inositol/Milk Thistle Extract mix) but I might add DMAA/Citrulline/ALCAR/Cocaine       
**Postworkout**: Whey/Casein

&amp;nbsp;

**How do you motivate yourself?** 

I'm incredibly stubborn. For the most part, and made it to the final ice lake (event is at the end of January, and we were breaking the ice to do some of the water obstacles), before I got pulled out because I looked like I had hypothermia. I didn't, although I was quite glad I didn't have to swim the lake, because I'd have tried. I found out afterwards that even though it looked like there was a reasonable distance to the end, there were actually only a few more easy obstacles after the lake. At some point

&amp;nbsp;

**How do you deal with naysayers and clashes between your lifestyle and that of your SO/friends/co-workers?** 

For the most part

&amp;nbsp;

**What advice do you take

I'll listen to anything. If it makes no sense, especially their own beliefs. I've believed some real brosciency things in the past, because the guy that told me was ripped or because the website it was on was well designed, and I'm a little embarrassed how long it took me to check for myself.

Having said that

&amp;nbsp;

**What are some training or diet-related things you know are true but cannot prove?** 

I decide the worth of a supplement using something similar to Pascal's Wager. I look at cost, it makes more sense to wager that you do.

&amp;nbsp;

**Is there anything that you do differently in your sport/training/diet that you've never seen others do?** 

The Yoth-Sarcasmo Press. That was the result of TeamYoth laughing at my daft exercises (I think the one in question was a One Handed Snatch to One Arm Overhead Pistol)

&amp;nbsp;

**What injuries have you dealt with?** 

Very few. Most are fleeting results of my stupidity. The only ongoing issue I have is with my left shoulder

&amp;nbsp;

**What are your favorite sports/fitness books/DVDs/websites?** 

The various fitness subreddits, JC Deen, Fitocracy, and occasionally T-Nipple have some good articles.

In my senior year I stumbled upon “Chaos and Pain” (CNP) and threw myself at that for my last rowing season.

My best on-water 2k in a single was (I believe) 8:21. Not phenomenal

February 2010 (start of real training): 

 * Bench/Squat/Deadlift = 225/205/275 

June 2011 (current @BW 165): 

 * Bench/Squat/Deadlift = 250/330/405 

**What is your competition and/or training philosophy?** 

If you feel like doing another set, so I generally just go as hard as I can while eating, sleeping, and pre/re-habing for 6-12 weeks then I take 1 week as a deload and go back to it. I have found that training heavy works better for me, so I rarely go higher than 8 reps. 

**What challenges do you face?** 

Almost none. I’m a healthy college-age male living alone and off-campus. My lifestyle is what I want it to be and other people rarely negatively influence me. My biggest “injury” is a snapping hip that I developed from rowing, and stretching keep this in check. This is not really a challenge that directly affects me, but discrediting and re-educating my teammates is a huge obstacle in our team function. A lot of the guys are from old-school coaches who watched Rocky a few too many times and had their guys doing 5-mile runs and 3 hour conditioning sessions. It is surprisingly difficult for me to explain why this and myriad other exercises (as for examples) are not effective training strategies for a sprint-rest sport, but I’m starting to get through. 

**How do you motivate yourself?** 

I think accomplishment leads to more accomplishment. The more I get into this the more I love it, and seeing their progress and growing enthusiasm is hugely motivational. We tested today and many of them turned what used to be 3RM’s into 10-rep sets. I can’t wait to watch them get stronger in the next 7 months and then roll over people when our season starts up again in February. 

**How do you deal with naysayers and clashes between your lifestyle and that of your SO/friends/co-workers**? 

Again, not on my friend’s birthday on Tuesday, Cinco de Mayo on Thursday, the neon party on Friday, and the house party on Saturday because I’m an adult and have school, a job, and goals. This is seemingly impossible for most of my peers to believe. 

**What advice do you take

I listen to most advice from people I deem as or more credible/experienced than I, so this is a more efficient process than it might seem. 

**What are some training or diet-related things you know are true but cannot prove?** 

Long-distance exercise is, as everyone who has seen Rocky or Chariots of Fire wants to go out for a 10 mile death run in the name of team building or “mental conditioning” and anyone who disagrees is a pussy. This ties into my problem with Crossfit…just because something hurts doesn’t mean it’s good for you. Sure, 5 sets of 23 deadlifts at 56% of your max is hard and painful, but so is a naked army crawl over Lego pieces. “But Crossfit/all those sprints/erging 500’s made me throw up so I must have been working hard!” It’s easier to recover from a night of drinking vodka/gin/whiskey than beer. Like the others, this could be proven and might already have been, I just don’t know it. 

**Is there anything that you do differently in your sport/training/diet that you've never seen others do? Any other little innovations you don't mind sharing?** 

I am the only person on my team who trains hill sprints more than flat sprints. I believe that the greater loading of the muscles, if you are, you should be working on flat form). Also, I am one of two people who train the neck, the other being my lifting partner. I believe that having a strong neck reduces your overall injury risk, especially with concussions. I also love the shit out of the Behind the Neck Push Press and have never seen anyone other than my training partner attempt it. My current 1RM is 215. The Ironman Squat Pyramid is another workout I picked up from Lewis and normally gets a few questions when I do it. Monkey Chins are another CNP influence, although I currently lack the facility to be able to do them. My buddy and I used to frighten the old people at the YMCA with [these](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BaieUDOPnbY).

**What injuries have you dealt with? What are the injury risks that come with your athletic endeavors?** 

Fall of my senior year I was being recruited by a couple universities for rowing and, but PT and stretching takes care of that. I get better at realizing when I’m approaching injury or staleness as I get more experienced and that helps me avoid setbacks. There are a variety of physical risks from lacrosse, from concussions to broken bones and shin splints. As a defenseman, I am responsible for administering most of these and am not worried about getting hurt. 

**Any advice on how to deal with these injuries and risks?** 

See a physical therapist BEFORE it’s an injury. This means recognizing signs of a problem and putting your ego behind you and realizing that more ART/SMR is not going to make it better. 

**What are your favorite sports/fitness books/DVDs/websites?**

My background may be helpful here. I'm a weightlifter and lacrosse-player in college, so I have a decent base of knowledge. **Edit:** I'm currently in off-season training, trying to walk into next season (february 2012) at at least 175 pounds and about 10% bodyfat. My training is solid, so I'm really just looking for diet help/clearing-up.


**Backloading:** Falls in line with the IF/Cheatmoders. Morning catabolism is beneficial for fat-loss and muscle-loss is negligible. You don't need quick energy until close to training. Eat few to no carbs before training---for example, carbs post-wo for 2-4 meals. This helps insulin sensitivity by restricting carbs until you ""need"" them post/intra-wo, at which time all of the ""quick energy"" will go to repairing and building muscle and re-upping muscle glycogen depleted from the workout. [Here](http://www.reddit.com/r/AdvancedFitness/comments/h6s90/to_backload_or_to_frontload_that_is_the_question/c1t34va) are some backloading sources.


**Frontloading:** Shelby Starnes and Jason Ferruggia are my main sources here. Morning catabolism, eat low-glycemic (read: whole grains) carbs for the first 2-3 meals of the day. Post-wo, consume high-glycemic carb for insulin spike, then eat few to no carbs for the remaining half of the day. On non-training days, eat carbs for the first 1-2 meals, then go paleo. This provides a base store of glycogen and ""quick energy"" for muscles to draw on during lifting and then restricts carbs post-wo because you don't need ""quick energy"" before a +20 hour period of inactivity (afternoon, evening, next morning before training). This helps insulin sensitivity by re-upping muscle glycogen depleted during sleep and then providing ""quick energy"" before you ""need"" it and then restricting it after.",t5_2s9km,True
1299956325.0,g2p5k,Initial Thoughts and Program Review: Wendler's 5/3/1 with Boring But Big accessory work,,28,6,24,"Most of you guys are aware of Wendler's 5/3/1

A quick overview:

* BBB is do the main exercise for that day with the accessory work also being more of the same main exercise.
* 5/3/1 week warmup and work sets
* Then 5x10 sets of 40-60% 1RM
* I chose 5x10 of ~40-50% 1RM

I've done it only for my last cycle because I was scared of the volume making me too big. I'm already 215-220 lbs and I blow up like a balloon with volume (because I eat too much usually).

My initial goal in the last cycle was to do it only for the '5' week and then do the Triumvirate in the '3' week, let's mix it up a little and also because I was doing caloric restriction of about 2000 cals per day and IFing as well, that maybe I wouldn't have to worry about bulk that week.

What I found is that:

* It's fucking brainless and I enjoy that.
* It's great for people with limited time such as me.
* BBB is tough and tiring. I have good endurance
Examples include having to alternate grip the last set of my 185lb DLs because of grip failure (For comparision
* I use the last 5 sets to work on some of the endurance and conditioning
* After the first week of completing all four lifts
* With the caloric restriction and IF
* Lifts were still going up.
* I would have a piece or two of pizza after DLs or Squats day with no effect on weight or definition. (Still focussing on staying below 1100 cals before going home from work)
* Whether you're looking to build mass or cut fat, bulking is much easier...

So, basic accessory exercises (dips, pullups, butt work, rows, conditioning).

A [few pictures](http://imgur.com/a/YgWVQ) of me mostly rowing

**Age:** 23

**Sex**: Male

**Sports:** 

Rowing/Triathlon; I competed at the collegiate (D3) level in rowing

**My story:**

I started rowing as a freshman in highschool (my parents forced me to try it) and ended up absolutely loving it. Rowing was the first endurance sport that I had tried that I was able to compete in, being in 1st place for ¾ of our championship race my junior year of college until our 7 seat passed out, and a trip to the royal Henley Regatta in England. Rowing taught me mental toughness, and I stand by the statement that no man really knows himself until he stares himself down at the 1500 meter mark of a 2k erg test. After graduating, I have moved onto triathlons as a way to stay in shape, stay motivated and keep pushing myself. I completed my first triathlon (a half ironman: 1.2mile swim, 56 mile bike

**Current Goals:** 

I’m shooting for a top finish at my next half-iroman. Reasonably, followed by a marathon) which I will feel happy to just complete but am aiming for a sub 11:30 time.

**Workout Regimen:** 

A typical week I average close to ~30 miles running

**What does your diet look like? Do you take any supplements?** 

My diet is pretty poor. I try and eat healthy

**What Have I achieved so far:** 

Some of my numbers include: a 6:21 2k erg (1:35.2 split/500 meters), and sub 9 minute miles for the 13.1 mile run), and a 3:38 marathon. When I used to lift for rowing here are some numbers I remember being able to do: 90 pushups, 22 pullups, 3 x 315x6 for squat, 3 x 185 x 15 bench. I have stopped lifting to train more for triathlon so aren’t very close to these number anymore. Also, for the record I am 5’10 ~185 lbs if you are trying to picture my bodytype.

**Competition and Training Philosophy:** 

My training philosophy is incredibly simple: listen to your body. I am very motivated so find that actually going and doing my workouts is never really an issue, and I will always skip a workout if I feel too tired/sore/sluggish for a session to be productive—rest is super important! A typical day for me would be work from 8-5, and then work out from 6-8. On weekends I do more volume. Ideally I try to get 1 day of rest a week, although this sometimes changes depending how I feel and what my schedule is.

**What Challenges do I face:** 

Aside from having to work and put in some crazy hours to train, but I think I’ve gotten proficient at it.

**How do you motivate yourself:** 

I feel like I am pretty self-motivated. I’m always thinking about how slow I am compared to other athletes (there will always be someone faster) and am constantly trying to close the gap. I also just love the feeling of satisfaction/accomplishment after a workout that I feel satisfied with (crashing on the couch after a 4 hour bike followed by a 10 mile run is amazing!).

**How do you deal with naysayers and clashes between your lifestyle and that of your SO/friends/co-workers?**

I haven’t really had any naysayers, and it’s not balanced if all I do is go to work and train.

**What advice do you take

I don’t really take any advice. I know what it takes to get faster, from wacky diets to supplements, I try to just do what feels right.

**What are some training or diet-related things you know are true but cannot prove?** 

I’m really waiting for someone to prove that bacon cheeseburgers are good for you!

**Is there anything that you do differently in your sport/training/diet that you've never seen others do? Any other little innovations you don't mind sharing?** 

I avoid training plans like the plague. I know they work for a lot of people

**What injuries have you dealt with? What are the injury risks that come with your athletic endeavors?** 

I had some pretty nasty shin splints for a few months (probably because I’m so fat)

**Any advice on how to deal with these injuries and risks?** 

Train smart and remember that rest is just as important as doing the work.

**What are your favorite sports/fitness books/DVDs/websites?** 

/r/fitness duh! I also like [beginnertriathlete.com](http://www.beginnertriathlete.com). I also used youtube to watch videos on swimming technique when I was learning how to swim.

**Anything else you want to add?**

1295022918.0,f2aip,Fucoxanthin: Unique fat loss agent,silverhydra,24,2,42,"**Preface**

- Proprietary (secret?) Blend Xanthigen (Fuco + Pomegranite) has 2.4mg active fuco per 300mg. Can’t hide this shit from chemical analysis :D (This will be used as a standard for the rest of the review)

- This is long

- Molecular weight of fuco is 658.81g/mol, 1mg fuco should increase the blood concentrations by 151.76 nanomoles if flawless (We’ll see later how the true value, just for simplicities sake, is a quarter of this; about 38 nmols/g)

- Fucoxanthin is fat soluble, just be aware it may be nice to take some fuco with your fish oil. (Irrelevant note, fuco appears to enhance [liver stores of DHA]( http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17536824), a component of fish oil; seems irrespective of taking it alongside though) Fuco should also **not** be taken alongside compounds that hinder fat uptake, such as Green tea extract and insoluble fibers.

**Non-stimulatory fat loss pill**

Lots of compounds, but may cause complications with susceptible individuals. Also, when making a ‘Fat-burning Stack’ one would be wise to not over-do the stimulation. Addition of non-stimulatory compounds to an advanced fat-burning stack can be considered a wise move for the final push.

Undaria pinnatifida is a plant containing fucoxanthin (it’s brown seaweed y’all)

The doses used in the study on humans (Why is this the only one? Hurry up Science

**Insulin sensitizing**

Possibly not directly, both experimental groups were high fat, but one received ethanol extracted fuco and the other straight Undaria pinnatifida. It is in the opinion of this author (me) that the scientists were smoking rocks during this experiment, as the ‘High-fat’ diets were 20%. (17% lard, 3% corn oil; wtf guys?). These results have been replicated [1]( http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20519145) [2]( http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20845386), the latter study even found weight gain attenuated (although the first study did not).

**Metabolism and Safety; the Tl;Dr reference page**

Fucoxanthin is the parent compound, [Pretty picture]( http://jn.nutrition.org/content/140/10/1824/F3.expansion.html) of relative levels of breakdown compounds) The first two are actually the active components, the former seems to be cardiac and the latter adipose, no fucoxanthin appears to be left after intestinal uptake [1]( http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19173766?dopt=Abstract). Knowing this is good for the following, although nothing bad will happen if you forget this in the future.  [1]( http://dmd.aspetjournals.org/content/32/2/205.abstract?ijkey=008bce16e93c265434823e47b00f455665e150ad&amp;keytype2=tf_ipsecsha) and [2]( http://jn.nutrition.org/content/132/5/946.abstract?ijkey=c5b7d93360d54453fb8df719be60f29ead28aef8&amp;keytype2=tf_ipsecsha). Fucoxanthinol is approximately 18-24% of fuco weight, Ama A is about 53-56%, and cis-Ama A is about 23-27%.

The latter study also indicates that intubation of 40 nanomols of fucoxanth**in** had plasma levels of fucoxanthin**ol** rise 10.4 +/- 5.3 nmol in 1 hour

(Given how the above relations of intake to serum don’t leave any buffer room for other organ stores after 1 hour

Major metabolites were found to be keto-carotenoids

**Final notes: What do if not Biochemist?**

Fucoxanthin appears to be a great fat loss compound, and no side-effects have yet been noted in human.

So, and eventually discussed calve exercises. The instructor stated that it's proper to do a standing, or straight leg, calve exercise first, as it utilizes both the gastrocnemius and soleus calve muscles. Then, follow it up with a seated calve raise to utilize the soleus specifically. This has always been my approach to calves, but then I got to thinking. Due to the amount a slack the gastrocnemius undergoes in a seated calve exercise, it wouldn't suffer from trauma or tearing, since standing calves exercise both the soleus and the gastrocnnemius muscles

When I asked this question to the instructor, I was hoping for more of an in-depth response. 

Sorry if that became a little unclear. That's probably the most I've ever crammed ""gastrocnemius"" and ""soleus"" in so few sentences. Anyway,False,self,t5_2s9km,False,,,t3_1fu7mc

I saw the DIY plans online here: http://m.instructables.com/id/CoreControl-DIY/?ALLSTEPS and have decided to attempt build my own version of the device (albiet with some subtle differences)

One thing in particular that I am a bit stumped on is how I can replicate the action of the wrist-seal-control device. (See the pro-sumer version of this device here: http://www.avacore.com/buy-corecontrol) 

Notice in this video how he twists a dial to create the vacuum seal. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q2yzItjfWyw

I think that's so much more elegant than struggling and tugging on a rubber glove that it's worth trying to figure out... but I have no idea what kind of hardware I could track down that will achieve that goal.

(Some form of sphincter or diaphram?)

Can anyone in the reddit hivemind come up with a good solution for that piece?

So far my idea is to place a few hot-cold gel packs (cooled to ~10c) in a 3.5L coleman thermos tub.
(**edit** this is the jug I'm using http://www.canadiantire.ca/AST/browse/5/SportsRec/Camping/Coolers/PRD~0854017P/Coleman+1+Gallon+Jug+with+Faucet.jsp?locale=en , air pump strapped to the side)

A cut inner tube across the lid will be used to create an air-tight seal and a small battery powered air pump will create the vacuum. (eg: http://www.canadiantire.ca/AST/browse/5/SportsRec/Camping/AirPumps/PRDOVR~0760014P/Sidewinder+D+Cell+Air+Pump.jsp?locale=en) 

Replicating their wrist-action would be really nice.

I'm not how to interpret this; my background is in physics not physiology. Why do these exponents have the value they do? Why is the gender difference only present in swimming? Is it important that the ratios and exponents are similar between the two sports?

[...]
&gt;Based on the results reported in Chapter V

&gt;1. Changes in jaw positioning while utilizing the EDGE device result in an improvement in grip strength for both men and women.

&gt;2.	The [EDGE](http://www.bitetech.com/wp/?page_id=98) device is statistically more beneficial than a placebo device for men and women combined.

&gt;3.	A ""placebo effect"" is evident for men. 

&gt;4.	A ''placebo effect"" is not evident for women. 

&gt;5.	There are some indications that the EDGE device may improve endurance.

[...]

&gt;Approximately 74% of the subjects with the EDGE device showed an increase in average grip strength as compared to testing without a device. Fifty-three percent of the participants who had a placebo device showed an increase in average grip strength values. The 'distribution of strength increases' while utilizing the EDGE device and the placebo device has been provided in Figures 21 and 22 respectively. The more than 20% difference in the number of people within a given population who showed an improvement in grip strength values while using the EDGE device versus the placebo device implies that the EDGE device is beneficial in enhancing strength. There also seems to be some gender-specific trends in the data.

I got interested in this since the start of **BTFC** prompted me to go into a bulking phase (I'm currently at 152 lbs). The reason is: my Bench Press

Looks great for strength and I know lots of people on it. It only works each body part 1x per week and from what I heard (might be broscience) this isn't optimal from the bulking perspective unless I have the testosterone of 20 men.

* **[Lyle's McDonald Generic Bulk](http://jcdfitness.com/2009/01/lyle-mcdonalds-bulking-routine/)** This routine foes on a different route with a upper-lower body split two times a week. I don't have know-how about the science behind it

* **[Dan John's Mass Made Simple](http://www.t-nation.com/free_online_article/sports_body_training_performance/mass_made_simple)** My last finding and the one I liked the most – the program is basically set like: 2 full body workouts per week that consist of Bench Press, but I'm on a gym addiction and two times a week seems so low.

Anybody have experience (and/or science) to help me choose the best path or insights to modify or develop them? Volume work looks like a constant but besides that these 4 programs looks quite different.

First of all I'm a female about 162 pounds

I compete in a weight class sport and have to lose about 10 pounds over the next 5/6 weeks. Aiming for 152 pounds.

I currently do SL 5x5 three times pw and supplement it with cardio + core work. I am doing a small amount of muay thai and running 3-5 times a week as well but am not allowed to do as much at the moment because of injury. (It may be another 2 weeks before I can do this back to my usual standard)

Because of the injury I am doing a lot more strength training than I used to and a lot less cardio

I estimate my BMR at 1600 and with general activity + gym 6 days pw closer to 2500.

I eat a predominantly Paleo diet

Making the weight is more important to me than keeping the muscle

-should I dial back strength training and try up the cardio?

-does the diet look dialed in enough to make it work?

-any major flaws in my plan that you can see? or tips to increase success/make it easier.

-I often lack compliance

The progression on this complex is also a bit wonky as it does basically all arms first then all legs and the transitions are not smooth. So I wondered if that was by design?

* Tax your arms for the first half
* Makes the transitions not so smooth to add just that little bit of extra 'fuck you' touch to the workout.
* Replacing the OH Squat with regular back squat would take away from the complex because you need that overhead bit to add the arms getting tired.

This is a common test rowers perform and shows how much power a rower can produce in 3 strokes. For reference

I scored 858 Watts

Work = force*distance

Force = (bodyweight + bar weight)*(gravitational acceleration)

Distance = (bar position at the end of the lift - bar position at the start of the lift)

Time = (time to lift the weight from floor to lockout)

**Constants**

Bodyweight = 78 kg

Gravitational acceleration = 9.81 m/s^2

Distance = 0.7366 m - 0.2032 m = 0.5334

Time = 2 s (I looked on youtube at a bunch of 1 RM attempts and this seemed to be the average)

**Results:**

Setting work to 858 Watts and solving for bar weight

from [here](http://www.empoweredathletes.com/interview-with-the-%E2%80%9Cmad-scientist%E2%80%9D-kelly-baggett/)

&gt; I don’t think there’s anything really special about the pull phase of the 0-lifts for the posterior chain and here’s why: From a standing position the muscles of the posterior chain are primarily designed to propel the athlete horizontally. In other words, engaging the posterior chain from a standing position with a bar hanging from your hands is sorta like standing up vertically with a barbell and doing a horizontal bench press from that position and trying to engage the pecs. The resistance is coming from the wrong direction.

&gt; So, on your back, or you’re using a device that requires you to work against horizontal force. Thus reverse hyperextensions, barbell hip thrusts (popularized by Brent Contreras), or sled towing/dragging/marches are better exercises for the posterior chain for the average trainee IMO. I’ve always been a big fan of reverse hypers and I thought the general indsutry movement to phase them out the last several years was a mistake.

&gt; Having said that

&gt; One good way I’ve found to get good posterior chain engagement with o-lifts is doing them from the hang in rhythmic fashion for fairly high reps (~8-10 or so). Some people call these speed cleans or speed snatches. I’ve always thought of them as “rhythm” cleans or “rhythm” snatches because in order to do them rapidly you have to use the correct muscle groups. If you don’t you lose your rhythm and the weight won’t go up. Kettlebell swings are also pretty good.

&gt; “Well if the muscles of the posterior chain are primarily designed to propel the athlete horizontally and the resistance in a squat is vertical doesn’t make the squat a useless exercise too?”

&gt; Well in the squat the hips have to go back and at the bottom the glutes get stretched. Therefore they have to contract to blast you out of the hole.

This was such a huge eye opener for me because I never realized that the hips were designed to propel the body horizontally. It makes such total sense now about why the hip snap is so important. I disagree about the RDL being the hardest to teach though

**edit: this was mostly for the people who do cleans or snatches in the hopes of improving explosiveness or posterior chain strength when there are a lot of other exercises out there that provide the same benefit without spending ages on learning technique. it's not a knock on olympic lifting at all. the title sucks but i can't change that now**",self,t5_2s9km,True,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/AdvancedFitness/comments/g7kno/kelly_baggett_on_why_cleans_and_snatches_are_not/

Within a few hours, or if you haven't chosen a group I will be contacting you to chose one together. I sincerely appreciate your help and willingness to try something new (for those of you to which yoga *is* new) and I look forward to working with each of you.

If you are reading this for the first time

Old message starts here:
Hey all. I am a certified yoga instructor, if the results of this study look promising, I will do a more in depth, controlled, study to see if I can quantify exactly what benefits yoga brings to weight lifters. I'm no longer interested in generic terms, such as ""increased general flexibility"" or ""relief of lower back pressure"" or ""more flexible hamstrings."" I want to know how long it takes, on average, and what the ideal frequency and duration of practice should be for specific benefits. In the future


**How long

8 week study

4 groups of yoga participants

You can belong to any of the 5 groups

One group will have to add NO YOGA

One group will practice yoga for only 20 minutes per session

One group will practice yoga for 30 minutes

One group will practice yoga for one hour once per week.

One group will practice yoga for one hour twice per week.

**Who I'm looking for to participate:**

Individuals that weight lift (the standard lifts we always talk about) at least 3 times per week

Individuals willing to continue on the same lifting schedule for the next 8 weeks (not the same weight, and intensity), while adding my prescribed yoga work.

Individuals willing to take 10 specific pictures at the start of the study, a few yoga poses, and lifting form with just the bar at the bottom of a squat, a dead lift, and one more lift of the participants choice.

MEN AND WOMEN

**How am I going to do this? What do you get?**

I will be recording my own yoga practices and/or using videos I approve of on the internet for the appropriate practice lengths depending on your category. I will use dropbox to deliver the videos, as well as proper sequencing, etc.

You get a GREAT addition to your lifting program, assistance, and corrections on form on yoga throughout the study. If you can't afford a yoga studio or an in person teacher, this is the next best thing!

You will need a yoga mat and just enough clear space to practice on it

To record any progress visually, and 8 weeks out. Besides the pictures, VERY short surveys will be taken after each practice, and slightly longer surveys at the start, 4 week, and 8 week marks. The surveys after your practice will take less than 3 minutes. The other 3 surveys will take less than 10 minutes. The biggest time investment on your part is the actual practicing you do, as well as the 10 pictures.

**To participate:**

I have a survey for you to fill out to record your height, current lifting schedule and what lifts you do, as well as any additional workouts you do no matter how small (even walking the dog). It will detail what pictures I need and what you will have to do yoga wise. 

Once you fill out the survey, ask for your pictures, link you to the proper drop box group according to your length and frequency of practice, and have at it!

***If you are interested or have ANY questions

Your personal information and pictures will be kept completely private. Only participants who give me permission to use their pictures will be seen by eyes other than mine. In the event that you do allow me to share the pictures,,False,self,t5_2s9km,True,,True

Diet: &lt;50 carbs per day



**Monday** 

45 minute fasted AM walk



**Tuesday** 

DB Bench Press - work up to one heavy but sub-max effort set

T-Bar Rows - work up to one heavy

*Complex A*

Stretching and mobility work with an upper body focus

Assistance work - arms (if energy / time permits)



**Wednesday**

Box Squat - work up...yeah you get it by now

Front Squat

*Complex B*

Stretching and mobility work with a lower body focus

Assistance work - abs

Arms



**Saturday**

Program Rationale: I'll only be doing two sets of heavy lifting before the complexes in an attempt to 1) keep strength up, and 4) have fun.

I'll be doing stretching and mobility work immediately after the complexes

From what I've read

Anyway, or suggestions are welcome.

So

* Fasted walks are great - even though they add two more days of early alarm clocks

* Complex A didn't go so bad.  Didn't heed the warnings well enough, though; I was pouring sweat for about 15 minutes straight afterwards.

* Complex B - I think I went too light.  Again

* Complex C...whoa.  I remember reading an article a while back about kettlebells and how the hip-snap is one of the most metabolic movements - I believe it after this complex.  95 lbs

* Complex D - Fuck.  This.  Noise.  Seriously.  Only one to leave me in ""holy shit"" mode after one set...at 75 freakin' pounds.  Immediately cut it to 65, and I was in so much pain that I couldn't do the squat and press in the final two sets.

Let me just note here: Backstroke is the second necessary stroke for people doing Front-Crawl to protect the shoulders from damage. So as you are improving your Front-Crawl

For swimming

So here's a round up of the first four

Apart from the first drill

1. [Drill 1](http://www.reddit.com/r/Swimming/comments/eozp0/because_it_was_suggested_as_an_ongoing_topicfirst/) is actually a bunch of different rotation drills. Rotation drills are the building block for Front Crawl. Experienced swimmers will continue to do them for the rest of their swimming lives. [This animation](http://www.swimsmooth.com/rotation.html) shows very well the ideal rotation and head positioning.

2. [Drill 2](http://www.reddit.com/r/Swimming/comments/ewlq1/drill_of_the_week_front_crawl_fingertip_drag/) is Fingertip Drag. Simplest of all drills and one of the oldest and most effective. Use it as much as you can during ordinary swimming

3. [Drill 3](http://www.reddit.com/r/Swimming/comments/f0u16/drill_of_the_week_3_frontcrawl_fist_drill/) is Fist Drill

4. [Drill 4](http://www.reddit.com/r/Swimming/comments/f5aba/drill_of_the_week_front_crawl_stroke_counting/) is Stroke Counting &amp; is aimed at those looking to improve a stroke in swimming recreationally

Let me finish with this point:
When asked how to improve a stroke

Someone who knows must see you stroke so you know what to focus on. You CANNOT do this by yourself. You do not have sufficient feedback to be able to determine stroke problems. Many pools will have a master's Club, isn't it?).

The three kettlebell exercises I am going to espouse here are the swing, but these three in particular are especially useful. The swing because it is a premier movement for improving hip mobility and power production, the clean because it is a premier movement for improving shoulder stability and power production, and the get-up because it is a premier movement for, well, just about everything - shoulder health, hip health, you name it.

I'm posting three links here, and why you should be doing them too. Here they are:

Kinetics of the peripheral anabolic use of dietary nitrogen also differed between groups with an earlier peak and a faster decrease from 4.5 to 8 h after the ingestion of HC than after ingestion of IC (diet effect: P &lt; 0.05; diet × time effect: P &lt; 0.0001)”

- At the 8h mark

- “The regional distribution of dietary nitrogen 8 h after meal ingestion greatly differed between meals and was more located in the splanchnic area after HC than after IC (60% compared with 44%; P &lt; 0.0001)

- Higher deamination rates in HC possibly due to higher peak of hyperaminoacidemia

- Admitted lack of studies comparing hydrolyzed protein sources against others in regards to muscle accretion. 

**[Effect of Whey Proteins

- Starved rats (72 hours)

- Hydroslate vs. Whole protein vs. AA

- Higher Nitrogen retention in the Hydroslate (9% after 4 days compared with 5% and 2%) as measured via less urea excretion

- Did not compare Liquid Hydroslate vs. Liquid Isolate/Concentrate

- Found a relationship between how fast a protein is absorbed and how much is utilized in the splanchnic bed overall as percentage. Faster absorption means a greater percentage in the splanchnic bed rather than peripheral tissues.

**Summary**

- Overall nitrogen retention after 8 hours was similar between hydrolyzed and non-hydrolyzed forms. Greater retention and excretion was noted in hydrolyzed.

- Study was conducted with a 700kcal beverage with 70g (40%) protein for both groups. Was not solely protein.

- Various parameters such as insulin, and leucinemia, were noted as being significantly higher, faster, in the hydrolyzed group.

- Area-under-curve

- Splanchnic use of amino acids was higher in the hydrolyzed groups, as faster proteins are typically devoted to a greater percentage to splanchnic tissues.

- Despite a higher amount of amino acids devoted to splanchnic tissues. More amino acids still passed through before the 2 hour marker to elicit a greater peak nitrogen utilization in the blood (17% vs. 9%)

- Stomach (Gastric) emptying of casein proteins is the same

- Hydrolyzed proteins (Whey and casein hydroslate) are a controversial topic. And the most touted sources are a supplement company that sells it (Biotest) and bloggers who seem to have a hard-on for hating Biotest; nary an unbiased source in sight.

- Hydrolyzed proteins seem to have significant differences in intestinal digestion and blood readings when compared to non-hydrolyzed (intact) proteins. These differences are correlated with muscular growth (insulin

* Have been able to understand the concept they're explaining and be able to ask for guidance when something just isn't making sense

What I think is also pretty important is

* the ability to apply without too much thought the technical alterations a coach is making with your technique

With weightlifting in particular

Something else that I think that is very important is the ability for the trainee to work through, people start lifting and show some real potential and then just disappear when a difficult patch in training happens.

I have read a lot of conflicting information on periodization. Some people really like it for the strength sports

I'd like your opinions on off-season programming and progression. Right now the team is doing WS4SB because they were all raw beginners when I started with them in May. They've been gaining steadily and can all do a &gt;BW 5-rep squat. I am more advanced and have been lifting 5 days/week on a power/speed/volume upper/lower split. My idea for some sort of periodization is this

April 25 to June 3: Beginner program

June 20 to Aug 1: WS4SB

Aug 8 to Sept 19: Pre-season

Oct 3 to Nov 17: Fall season (rare games)

Nov28 to Jan 20: Winter (offseason)

Jan 20 to May 20: Spring season (almost weekly games)

It's somewhat common knowledge amongst weightlifters (both of the olympic and powerlifting variety) and other high intensity exercise enthusiasts that CNS fatigue is something to be mindful of. People like [Christian Thibaudeau over at T-Nation](http://www.t-nation.com/free_online_article/sports_body_training_performance/the_thib_system_8212_fatigue_and_best_exercises) say that: ""it's possible to drain the nervous system so much that it takes so long to recover that the muscles actually start to detrain while the CNS is still recovering"". That's definitely something most people want to avoid.

Signs of CNS fatigue include general fatigue

The article also goes into the causes of CNS fatigue such as: *""The theory is the high 5-HT/low Dopamine brings on CNS Fatigue with low 5-HT/high Dopamine resulting in enhanced performance""*. I also found a scientific study on the [Possible mechanisms of central nervous system fatigue during exercise](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9000155) which seems to agree with the previous article's assertion.

I know that on the weightlifting side of things deadlifts and squats (which are both heavy

I'd also like to request that the below information be kept within the confines of /r/Advanced

Sports-specific goal:

* Increase maximal climbing strength and power
* Increase bouldering grade

Increasing localized muscular anaerobic endurance was not part of the training objectives
____


Bouldering is a sport dependent not only on strength-to-weight ratio

* Cardio needs to avoid building leg muscle
* Sport-specific training is *extremely* taxing to tendons in fingers and forearms
* Sport-specific training creates muscular imbalances if not offset with specific antagonist training
* Overtraining symptoms are noticeable on shorter time-frames than many other sports (in my experience) [side note: this was more apparent when training the localized anaerobic endurance for climbing prior to my decision to commit to a more pointed training program for strength and power]
* Leg muscle *atrophy* is actually preferable to a large extent
* Hip flexor strength is very important
* Core strength and *power* is extremely important
* Muscle hypertrophy is not desirable under any circumstances
* Weight gain is not an option

Some notions that my training reinforced:

* Full hydration
* Influence of pre-workout nutrition and proper rest on intramuscular coordination
* Ego can be extremely detrimental to progress
* Body composition improvement using solely diet is preferable to using a combination of diet and aerobic and/or anaerobic work
* Increased circulation through tendons in fingers for the purposes of repair and growth is accomplished with a combination of vigorous massage and hot/cold therapy.
* Core strength development could be accomplished using many techniques used in many other sports - bridges, etc.  These exercises also aided in the development of hip flexor strength.

Background: Training with power has revolutionised cycling in the last 10 years or so.  There are lots of interesting aspects to it



[http://home.trainingpeaks.com/power411.aspx](http://home.trainingpeaks.com/power411.aspx)
[http://www.cyclingpowerlab.com/TrainingWithPower.aspx](http://www.cyclingpowerlab.com/TrainingWithPower.aspx)
[http://www.tpesportscoaching.com/CP_intro.html](http://www.tpesportscoaching.com/CP_intro.html)



The basic concept is to reference everything to your Functional Threshold Power (FTP) which is defined as the average power output you could sustain for 1 hour on the bike



One of the useful results from knowing your FTP is being able to reasonably accurately quantify training stress between vastly different workouts.  The accepted formula for training stress is:



TSS = 100*(time of workout in hours)*(average power of workout/FTP)^2



If you know that your FTP is (say) 250W, these two workouts are similar and should provide a similar training effect.  



If you know the training stress, you can start to predict performance by estimating the amount of fatigue built up by training stress.



It is a bit complicated

* **Passive Flexibility** is the ability to assume extended positions and then maintain them using only your weight
* **Active Flexibility** is the ability to assume and maintain extended positions using only the tension of the agonists and synergists while the antagonists are being stretched
* **Dynamic Flexibility** is the ability to perform dynamic (or kinetic) movements of the muscles to bring a limb through its full range of motion in the joints

Most ""stretching"" routines cover only passive stretches. There's nothing wrong with this. You cannot gain active or dynamic flexibility without *first* having passive flexibility. But the real conundrum is that there tend not to be any good recommendations or routines for gaining active or dynamic flexibility. Even martial arts advice on kicking height always seems to be just passive stretching recommendations.

We've had [24 Member Spotlights](http://www.reddit.com/r/AdvancedFitness/search?q=Member+Spotlight&amp;restrict_sr=on) so far and they've been a great success.

Right now I have no plan to move from weekly spotlights. The queue is close to empty right now. A sudden surge of votes (4 or 5  lucky) would last a month. The weekly spot allows the everyone to look forward to it and enjoy it (and gives me time to get it done).

Occasionally I get a few weeks ahead behind the scenes, since I have to wait a few days for each to be sure.

We've only had two ladies so far and I think we'd all like to see that change.

Let me clarify my criteria/request:

The idea is to spotlight people from whom we can learn AND whom have contributed to reddit. 

This can mean high profile active contributors on any of the fitness reddits.

Benched 400 and mentioned once in a comment? Congrats. But unless the person is part of the reddit community through participation, EDIT: they stay in the queue.) 

**There is a minimum comment karma of 1000 as an entry requirement**. 

EDIT: *No* answer is obligatory. Usually pictures are the only real bone of contention.

You might not like this limit but I'm sticking with it

* Send nominations to the [nominate](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=nominate) link. I check it fairly regularly but it could get to a week or even more before you get a response. 

EDIT: If you don't get a response

* Please provide the user link to the user you are nominating.

* Tell me why you are nominating them. (Mispelled user names with no reason doesn't make my life easier).

* Previous features members: Can you think more about nominations please?


* Most of you guys love talking about lifting. The diversity we've started to see has been fantastic also. Let's have more people from other sports.

* Some people have nominated themselves. I've (politely) rejected these requests unless someone else nominated them.

EDIT: Some rejections were later featured.


The Member Spotlight is about our community. It's about learning from each other and celebrating each other's successes. It's NOT about personal gripes or vendettas. I don't want to see any bitching or back-biting in there. Feel free to disagree with each other

**EDIT**: The nomination queue is private. Only svunt &amp; I have access to know who's lined up. Some public nominations may already have been added or discussed or rejected. It's past of the reason for asking for nominations via PM also. Another is so that we can keep nominations coralled out of our own accounts

If you all want to me leave Member Spotlight

Brief background on me: I signed up for Tough Mudder Melbourne in the interests of challenging myself and having something to train for that incorporated both strength work and middle distance running.

Couple of Criticisms: 

1. TM call their event the toughest event on the planet. It's a pretty laughable label when you think about it. We'd seen the Ironman event in Melbourne the weekend before and it's childs play beside that.

2. Spectator tickets on the day were $40. Only $15 if you bought the ticket before the event. I still can't believe or understand this. Considering spectators didn't get to see a whole lot

3. Apparently later in the day there were quite long lines for obstacles making the course much less fun in the afternoon. I was in the first wave on the first day and never waited at an obstacle though. I got through the course in about 2 hours

The course really was a lot of fun and the whole event very well organised. The obstacles I thought would be hard turned out to be pretty easy and obstacles I expected to be easy turned out a bit harder than I thought.

Stand out obstacles: The ice bath I was dreading but you're pretty warm by the time you get there

The quarter pipe is tough as they cover it in water and detergent and you have to really run at it to get to the top. After already running 19k it's difficult to sprint. Took me a couple of goes to get to the top.

Electric wires: I personally didn't get a strong shock from these, higher adrenaline or people got shocked differently.

A few guys there were running in bare feet that I saw getting their feet stitched back up by the medics at around the 9k mark. Probably should've ran in bear feet instead... *sorry*

Lots of guys who obviously didn't run enough in training were cramping up by around 14 - 16k mark. Injuries

Lots of twisted ankles on the course as well as most of it was run over pretty uneven terrain in paddocks.

Overall the obstacles were relatively easy for someone in good physical condition. Not a lot of strength required really. Having run some half marathons before I'd say this was probably easier.

Last month for 30 days I did 1500 calories per day (Except thanksgiving) and started taking EA pre gym.
Still yet I wasn't seeing results so I added TTA, and a 1-a-day multi to my pre workout cocktail. I've been doing on average 1200 calories/day. Sometimes I go up to 1500, sometimes I stay as low as 800.

I've been getting a minimum of 150g protein every day

I only eat carbs pre gym for sugar boost

I get 40-50g carbs pre and 20-30 post (All high GI)

P.S.- Yes, but I've been stuck for like three months at this fat gelatinous state and it's seriously starting to fuck with my head.

This is basic periodization similar to aerobic training where you periodize between long steady state and interval training.

I've seen it both on myself in other rowers and all coaches I've discussed rowing and weight training with say the same thing: you need to periodize to prevent plateaus.

My goal through early spring is to pack on muscle and maintain strength by adopting this intense program and eating above maintenance 5 days a week via an IF dieting approach. You'll see my Wendler/Starr/Rippetoe influence showing in my take of Norton's training philosophy. 

I err on the side of free-weights and really am not much of a fan of machines. I really only included three instances of machine-specific work (occasional incline cable flies, though I am open to input. 

I also have a barbell boner

I purposefully target arms and chest, and the over-reaching principles are not too far off of Norton's original template.

Oh and I should say that I'm focusing more on front squats over back squats at the moment.

Is such a program meant only for very advanced people?

Here are my 1RMs:

* Squat: 285 (Don't care about)
* Dead: 325 (Want to improve.)
* Press: 130 (Meh.)
* Front Squat: 215 (Want to improve.)
* Bench: 185 (This is most irritating.)
* DB Row: ~105? (Meh.)

Are we saying that ""fast twitch"" fibres are better ""hit"" with explosive, rather than steady, reps? Is that even the right level to make that distinction at? ""Fast twitch for fast reps, slow twitch for slow""? I find that hard to believe... Fast twitch is supposed to *activate* fast, right? Meaning, but can keep going for longer. So *explosive* reps does exactly the same as slow reps

I guess the (my) bottom line is: how important is it to incorporate a focus on explosive concentric phase - maybe foregoing a focus on the eccentric phase as well - versus doing a regular rep

The example, one person does the ""powerlift"" style, as fast as possible up, and not really caring about ""catching"" the bar going down. Another person does a slow lift - maybe because it's heavy - and slams the bar back down, like the ""powerlifter"". And then there's those like me, who go up slowly, and go back down slowly.

**The Dumbbell Stopgap**

**Introduction**

It is almost universally accepted that the best way to get stronger or increase lean muscle mass is regular barbell training. Unfortunately, feel-good globogyms are the only available exercise facilities. Often, in what seems like no more than lip service to strength training, these gyms have racks of relatively light dumbbells for ""toning."" These are far from ideal as exercise implements, and both barbell training and bodyweight exercises are generally more useful for building strength.

If you have access to barbells and wish to weight train, some of which comes from current and/or former world record holders.

If you wish to train in bodyweight exercises, and learning basic and advanced body mechanics. For these, [Overcoming Gravity](http://www.amazon.com/Overcoming-Gravity-Systematic-Gymnastics-Bodyweight/dp/1467933120) and [Building the Gymnastic Body](http://www.amazon.com/Building-Gymnastic-Body-Gymnastics-Strength/dp/0982125305) are both excellent resources. Check out /r/bodyweightfitness for more resources and a wealth of user-generated content (including much information from Steven Low, the author of Overcoming Gravity). The only thing you really need for this is a bit of open space (but access to some sort of horizontal bar is highly helpful).

If you have the resources to build a home gym, and money, but if you have those three things, you should definitely consider it. A home gym can start as simply as a single kettlebell or be as complex and specialized as a professional strongman's training facility. If you have a single kettlebell and a place to stand, you have enough of a home gym to get started down this route. Buy [Enter the Kettlebell](http://www.amazon.com/Kettlebell-Strength-Secret-Soviet-Supermen/dp/0938045695) and check out /r/kettlebell.

All that being said

**What this program is not**

This program is *not* for people with a single pair of fixed-weight dumbbells. This program is *not* an optimal way to get strong or build muscle mass. This program is *not* a long-term training program.

**What this program is**

As the name implies, usually at 2.5 or 5 lb intervals) or a pair of adjustable dumbbells. You will be working out 3 times a week.

You will probably look silly and do exercises that no one else in your gym is doing. This is okay. The only person judging you in the gym is yourself. If someone in the gym is looking at you funny or giving you dirty looks or even talking about you

**The Program**

There are 2 workouts: A and B. They will alternate with a one-day gap and have a 2-day gap every weekend. So on the first week, and A again on Friday (or whatever 3 days you have chosen). On the second week, you will do Workout B on Monday, A on Wednesday, and B again on Friday. And so on. Start with the lightest dumbbells available to you. These may seem incredibly easy or may be too heavy. If they are easy, start with them anyway so that you can learn proper form. As you increase the weight, the exercises will become more difficult. If the available dumbbells are too heavy

*Workout A*

[Bulgarian split squat](http://exrx.net/WeightExercises/Quadriceps/DBSingleLegSplitSquat.html) or [Lunge](http://exrx.net/WeightExercises/Quadriceps/DBLunge.html)

[Plank](http://www.exrx.net/WeightExercises/RectusAbdominis/BWFrontPlank.html)

**Progression**

For each exercise but the plank, up to 10. Do this three times (sets) before moving on to the next exercise. Rest for 1 minute between sets. When you can do an exercise for 3 sets of 10 reps each, increase the dumbbell weight by one step next time you do the exercise. You may progress very quickly using this method, but eventually it will take longer to increase the weight. This is okay. If you remain stuck at the same number of reps and the same dumbbell weight for 3 workouts, decrease the dumbbell weight by two steps and try progressing again.

For the plank

**Extra exercises**

If you have access to them, you will most likely be stronger than many people in your gym.

**What's next**

This program has a relatively short shelf life. It runs out when your available dumbbell weights run out. This should be long enough, information, and/or equipment to move on to one of the more effective programs mentioned above. If you receive or acquire enough equipment to end this program earlier and move on to more effective training methods, please do so as soon as possible. All of the programs mentioned above were made by experienced fitness professionals. This program was made by a random asshole, who is not a fitness professional, on the internet.

So, there are a few reasons. I believe the most important is that the majority of people in this data set have been lifting for less than a year, and haven't had a chance to reach their full potential, or fall into their genetic rut, depending on how you look at it. I could try restricting the data to people who have been lifting for a certain amount of time, although that would cut out a lot of data. Another possibility is that powerlifting is not subject to the same scaling laws as weightlifting, or that the biomechanical disadvantages of being tall exactly outweigh their benefits.

The Situation: My father over the past several years has seen a serious deterioration of his health and fitness. He was a carpenter by trade and has always been strong and active. He had a bum knee as a result of an ACL tear and several barbaric surgeries in 1969. About 9 months ago he went in for a total knee replacement. That surgery went really well but less than a week after he was back in the hospital for almost three months with MRSA and kidney failure. So he's been laid up for almost 9 months for recovery and he's done with rehab would like to get back to being strong. 

Stats:
Age- 62
Gender- Male
Weight- 200lbs
Height- 5'9""

Diet: Recently I convinced him to switch to a [paleo esque](http://www.marksdailyapple.com/) diet and he's made great progress towards being healthier. 

Facilities available: Senior center with weight area and full size pool. 

Goals: Improve quality of life by getting stronger and increasing activity levels. 

Injuries: Total Knee Replacement surgery in right knee. History of Shoulder injuries. Spotty Kidney function. 

My plan:

Swimming 2-4 days per week

Lifting 3 days/week

Was planning on doing a pretty high volume template for the first month or two to rehab and get the CNS used to being under load. I was planning on training primarily Dan John's basic human movements (squat, pull, loaded carry) 

Sample week:
Mon (Squat/Pull)

- 10x10 Barbell box squat to high box
- 5x10 One arm cable row
- 5x10 Band Pull aparts

Wed (Hinge/Press)

- 10x10 KB Swing
- 5x10 Landmine Press
- 5x10 Reverse Hyperextention

Fri (Squat/Loaded Carry/ Pull)

- 10x10 Goblet Box Squat
- 5x10 One arm Cable Row
- 5x 200m Farmers walk.

**Setup**

No breakfast (other than unsweetened tea) and no lunch with a regular dinner for 2 days prior to bike ride. The night before the ride I ate a regular meal which was moderately low carb and some fruits (apples and oranges) and a taro dessert (taro root with coconut milk and some sugar) before bedtime. Breakfast was coffee with some whole milk

**Biking**

I was concerned my glycogen levels were low so I drank gatorade right before I started biking and throughout the ride. The bike ride was 30 miles and fairly hilly. In the past I would only drink water (with no prior IF) and would go into glycogen debt after 25 miles. This time I felt strong throughout the ride. My average speed was 14.8 mph (could’ve been faster but had to slow down for a friend).
 

**My Conclusion**

From my experience

**Possible Counter Arguments and Flaws**

* I am in much better riding shape now.
* Having oranges
* A sample size of one is not sufficient for any conclusion.  The next step is biking right after 12 hours of fasting.

I'm looking for ideas to modify my upper body workouts in order to minimize aggravating the problem until I can work out a treatment plan with my physician.

Symptoms seem to worsen after performing exercises like the bench press and overhead press in which a weight is pressing down on my elbow.

I'm considering drastically lowering the weight used for these exercises

Would simply performing long duration handstands be enough to maintain my shoulder strength until I can get this figured out?

Any ideas or experiences would be greatly appreciated.

So, eking out some more strength gains after a little over half a year of beginner LPs (SS, then GSLP).  Though I love strength training, I initially went into it because it was a good investment for later mass building.  But since the initial goal was aesthetic, I have been giving thought to a bodybuilding program, which I may or may end up doing after this Madcow modification.  I was hoping to get some feedback.  Though the goal is to mass up, I also want to preserve strength, especially for muscle groups that are largely fast-twitch fiber.  Program is influenced by the work of Menno Henselmans and Jim Stoppani

I've got a 4-day and a 3-day version... the 3-day mostly just reorganizes the shoulder day into the chest and back days, lighter for high rep; still working out the details.  Here's the 4-day version:

**Day 1: Chest**

- Barbell Bench Press (low rep)
- Incline Dumbbell Bench Press (medium rep)
- Pronated Grip Cable Flyes (medium rep)
- Rolling or Overhead Tricep Extension (low rep)
- Body-weight Dips (high rep)

**Day 2: Back and Bicep**

- Bent Over Barbell Row (low rep)
- Kroc Row (high rep but heavy)
- Barbell Curl (medium rep)
- Hammer Curl (low rep)
- Chin-ups (medium rep)

**Day 3: Rest**

**Day 4: Shoulders**

- Barbell Overhead Press (low rep)
- Pronated Grip Rear Delt Raise (medium rep)
- Face Pulls (high rep)
- Barbell Shrugs (low rep)
- Neck Extension/Flexion (high rep)

**Day 5: Lower Body**

- Barbell Deadlift (low rep)
- Barbell Box Squat (medium rep)
- Barbell Squat (widowmaker: high rep)
- Barbell Calf Raise (high rep but heavy)
- Glute Ham Raise (medium rep) or Hamstring Curl if unavailable/can't

**Day 6/7: Rest**

For ab work, reverse crunch, leg raise, cable crunch, choose one each workout day and do it if desired.

1309209500.0,iaots,Combating over-hydration before endurance events. ,GATechAE07,10,2,18,"Hey All

I'm looking for some advice on combating overhydration in preparation for a race over the course of the next week. I know it's kind of an odd thing to encounter as most runners tend to worry about dehydration

1) It's not uncommon for me to drop in excess of 2% of bodyweight on a quick 5k training run.

2) I often find my self unable to physically drink more

3) It's not uncommon for me to urinate 3+ times throughout the night.

*ETA: I've recently been to a doctor and had blood work done; I am not diabetic

4) I've recently been cramping very quickly

It was a very easy situation to overlook until this point. I started drinking an excess of water while weight training, I've fallen into a cycle where I train, dump an incredible amount of water weight, then binge on water to force re-hydration (also because of what I perceive to be a never-ending thirst). As a result, everytime I go out for a longer run my body immediately dumps all of my water reserves. In cooler weather, I initially attributed the strain on my body to a lack of conditioning and pushed through. However, as the heat has intensified, I realized I had a problem.

In a nutshell

My plan is the following:

1) Scale back water intake significantly.

2) Up my sodium and potassium intake.

3) Cut out stimulants/diuretics (ie: caffeine).

4) Eat a sodium/carb heavy meal the night before the event in hopes of increasing water retention (followed by a modest liquid meal/banana the next morning).

I've also do most of my running in the early afternoon (hottest part of the day)

After stressing over whether I was “ready” for 5/3/1 or not

First, work a physically demanding job, or have a family to protect from zombie outbreaks. Therefore, aesthetics are important to me. 5/3/1 with its customizable assistance allows for that focus with the prescribed volume. I wanna get stronger, of course, but I also wanna *look* like I’m strong.

**The Results: It Went *Okay***

* Weight: 158 / 167 ~ +9

*Cycle 1 vs. Cycle 3 estimated 1RMs using Wendler's formula (Weight x Reps x .0333 + Weight = Estimated 1RM).*

* Squat: 268 / 275 ~ +7

* Bench Press: 185 / 192 ~ +7

* Deadlift: 327 / 335 ~ +8

* OHP: 134 / 129 ~ -5 &amp;#3232;\_&amp;#3232;  

As for my results, but there wasn't a big change after the third cycle so I put off taking ""afters"" until the 6th cycle, maybe. I definitely got stronger in the big lifts, but not by a shitload. The squat still gives me trouble despite working my balls off on it. My bench took a big hit from an annoying injury that set me back big-time. My deadlift is the only thing continuing to rise steadily, but I fear that’s coming to an end soon. The OHP? Well, fuck the OHP. I don’t even wanna talk about it. I’m kidding, but as you can see

-----------------------------------------
**Questions**

I’d really love some help optimizing my accessory work. I know there’s gotta be some inefficient

1. I’m looking to replace the Hip-thrusters on Squat day. They’re a bitch to set up and I have to rearrange the whole gym in order to stay out of everyone’s way when I do them. Also, glute/ham exercise I can do to assist my squat?

2. Ab wheel rollouts: kneeling's pretty easy

3. I do Incline Dumbbell Bench Presses for 5x10 pretty much just because Wendler says “when in doubt, 3x8, or 5x8 maybe? The goal with these is to push my pressing numbers, both bench and OHP. I'd also be lying if I said I didn't want a bigger chest. Also, is there any reason to be doing these with short rest intervals? I kinda just got into the habit of doing that with all the 5x10 accessory work.

4. Power Shrugs: I made up this rep scheme off the top of my head:     1-2 light-weight warm-up sets; 3 heavy sets; high-rep (~20); 1-3 more sets at about 75% for added volume; 1-2 sets of overhead shrugs with just the bar. I'm pretty sure it's way more than enough, hence the extra volume.

5. Front Squat: I've been doing these at 5x10, any advice on rep scheme? 3x8? 5x5? Something else?

6. Pull-ups: I've been super-setting these with dips

7. Dips: What the hell happened to my dips? I used to be able to bang out over 10 reps with 45 lbs of added weight

**Diet &amp; Supplements - 24 / Male / 5'11 / 162lbs** (in case you forgot)

Despite my best efforts

The Refreshed Plan:

Notes:

* LeanGains IF.

* Mostly vegetarian diet. In the past I kept it pretty strict, though.

Rest Days:

* Calories: 1500-2000

* Macros: &gt;150g protein / &lt;40g carbs / fat to fill calories

* Carbs are all “incidental

Workout Days:

* Calories: 2000-2500

* Macros: &gt;150g protein / 50-100g carbs / fat to fill calories

* I'm going to limit the carb intake to post-workout and incidentals only and resume my rest day nutrition a few hours after my post-workout meal. I used to maintain a higher carb intake throughout workout days

* Sugar once a week on a cheat day.


I'm a little concerned about the total calories on workout days. 2000-2500 seems a tad low

**Supplements**

* BCAAs for fasted training

* Jack3d pre-workout

* Creatine

* EC stack 3x per day

* Yohimbine HCL during fasted cardio

* Fish Oil

* ON Whey

* ON Casein

* Fiber (Metamucil

* Fucoxanthine

* Vitamin D

* Multi-vitamin

How important is it to have both a vertical (overhead press

Let me ward off the idiots here.

** If you ""hate"" an exercise because it aggravates an injury

** Don't do it half-assed

We all have an exercise that we hate because we're not good at it. Some people enjoy running sprints but hate running longer distances. Some people like pullups but hate chinups. Some people enjoy squats but hate lunges.

My personal enemy is stairs. Fuck stairs. Stair sprints kill me.

But atleast once a month

When I did them today

There are two reasons for doing this.

1) You probably hate the exercise because it's not your strong point. Therefore

2) Assuming you push the intensity in your regular workouts

I've oddly found it bolsters my willpower over the next couple of days instead of draining it as I expected. I thought I'd have used up my willpower forcing myself to do stairs and would end up fucking up my diet, ""You got nothing on me you pathetic sugar loaded whore. I'm the fucking CONQUEROR OF STAIRS, and no donut shall stand in the way of my glory"" and then walk away.

- Shoulder exercises were light-weight BTN presses (after sufficient warmup) as it opened up my torso and alleviate a ton of pain. Afterwards some lat raises were put in with an elbow bend (as the elbow bend seems to prevent my rolling my shoulder forward).

Find a comfortable position. Lying down with your eyes closed is a good way to start. Place one hand on your chest, but DO NOT THRUST IT OUT. Allow your breath to come naturally. Take a minute to get it right.

It will take 2-3 weeks to feel like you have a real handle on it

For performance: focusing on success guided imagery. You too should learn the basic relaxation techniques described above, but there are a number of pre-recorded imagery exercises you can find via the google, or you can make your own to listen to while you train:

Find a comfortable position, and the temperature is perfect. You are easily hitting your goal pace, and you feel strong. Your footfalls are light and soft, your breath is steady and even. You notice the other runners around you, but they have no impact on how you feel. You are calm, and collected. Focused, and relaxed. You see your rival up ahead.

* First row is starting point. Feel free to change to your specs

* The ""Deficit"" column is dependent on the protocol I'm modeling. I.e. Bulk = maintenance on rest days
* LBM and BF columns iterate on previous entry and are changed based on calorie consumption the day before
* The partitioning assumption is built into the LBM and BF rules (the ""if"" clause- if I lifted the day before

1294859685.0,f120m,[Review] Coan/Phillipi Deadlift Routine,,6,0,6,"##What is the Coan/Phillipi Deadlift Routine?##

Summary from [Tsampa.org](http://tsampa.org/training/scripts/coan_phillipi_deadlift/):

&gt; This is a 10-week deadlift program designed by the legendary powerlifter Ed Coan for Mark Phillipi. It goes against the grain of the ""To Deadlift More, with the last 6 weeks ramping up towards a new max attempt. The program also champions power shrugs to improve the lockout.

##Who is the Coan/Phillipi Deadlift Routine For?##

This is a very intense program if followed strictly, looking to improve technique, or push themselves quite hard to make considerable progress in 10 weeks.

##How Would I Follow This Routine?##

[Powerpage.net](http://www.powerpage.net/coanphildead.html) gives an overview of the program

---
##My Experience With Coan/Phillipi (Fall 2009)##
    
**Prior Stats**

* *Deadlift Max* 405 lbs
* *Weight* 123.5 lbs

###Ending Stats###

* *Deadlift Max* 430 lbs (+25 lbs)
* *Weight* 125 lbs (+1.5 lbs)

###Summary of Experience###

Core deadlift sets ramp up before dropping, both mentally and physically.  I would say week 4 was the worst.  From there, the week 5 and 6 were a much needed ""break"".  My progress held well and what I felt was difficult on week 4 for my main deadlift set was quite easy on week 7, and on week 8, I lifted more than my previous 1RM, which boosted my mood.

The speed sets, it ramps down to 6x3 and 3x3, but not before kicking you in the ass.  I've heard people vomiting on this program, and while it didn't happen to me, I came very close a couple times.

Aside from following the program as close as possible, prehab, rehab, and sleep schedule before starting.  You may be doing more work than usual, so if you're looking to maintain your current weight, you'll probably want to add a couple hundred extra calories to your deadlift day.

For prehab and rehab
 
###Mistakes I Made###
 
I tried to follow this program to the best of my ability, probably less than 30g/day, and felt very sluggish.  I did not use any pre-workout supplements, but I think that could have helped (some caffeine, yohimbine hcl, or 1,3).  Also, especially on the lats.  I made the mistake of not doing more lat-specific work prior to starting this program

###Overall Impressions###
 
I felt this program worked for me

I have for a couple of years now had trouble with my elbows. In every pressing movement

The snap/pop feels more powerful in the right elbow than the left. This has at times resulted in slight dull pain after the session or the day after. This happens after I go heavy in the pressing movements

I have stopped doing all tricep-isolation exercises entirely. I only do ohp

At first I was thinking it was nervus ulnaris playing a trick on me -- but that does not seem to be the case. I can not feel or see the nerve moving

That leaves the medial triceps head. My idea here is that either the head or the bursa between the head and the surrounding tissue/bone has gotten inflamed, and thus the snapping is happening because the tendon (or whatever it is) is popping out of where it should be.

What I do know for sure is that the snapping is in the area of the medial triceps head and nervus ulnaris. It's in that region.

To my question: what can I do to fix this? If my diagnosis is correct

Also, all pressing movements).

It's been about a month since I stopped doing intermittent fasting to test whether or not it would alleviate my symptoms.  TL;DR: it hasn't ~~and I no longer believe that I'm going hypotensive.~~

Since moving back to a more frequent diet plan I've still been occasionally getting lightheaded doing power cleans.  The only time I ever passed out was during a fasted set of them but I don't think it was the fasting that caused the issue.  I think it was the increased caffeine consumption that accompanied the fasting.  I've noticed a correlation between severity of symptoms and pre-training caffeine intake regardless of meal timing.

~~Due to caffeine's effects as a vasoconstrictor
It has been explained to me in the comments that caffeine is likely to be exacerbating the hypotension.

I am 5'11

A friend and I got into a fight to defend a third friend. We were heavily outnumbered. Thank god we knew how to defend ourselves...I ended up with a bad case of broken face and long story short lost my sight for more or less three months. ([Here is a picture of me](http://imgur.com/dOcfHJI) just for the lulz...ahhh good times!...we actually had alot of fun with staff at the hospital)

As soon as my sight came back and the doctors allowed me to train I came back to boxing and started lifting. Back then

So I have been lifting and especially eating for a year. I realise now that my routine is not the greatest and I would like to switch to starting strength (the programming strength version with pull/chin ups).

Here is the issue, right away ignoring the cut?

I am right now around 15% to 16% bf. I would very much like to carry on the cut to around 12%. I plan to get back seriously into boxing(Muay Thai) now that I can the excess bodyfat is really uncomfortable. I checked for similar threads on the starting strength and their answer was keep eating even if you are above 20%. This is not really an option for me.

My program

*Monday* 
Chest: 
Bench press,dips, 
Biceps:
Barbell curls

*Tuesday* 
Back of the legs 
Stiff legged deadlift
abs:
leg raises,planks

*Wednesday*
Shoulders:
Dumbell press,Bent over laterals,

*Thursday:*
Front of the Legs:
Squat
Abs:
As in tuesday

*Friday:*
Back:
Chin ups, back extension
Triceps:
Skull crushers

Now that I am on a cut: 30mn cardio 7 days a week at an average of 12 km/h.

Here are my stats:

Squat 225,OHP 125.

My intermediate term goals is to get my squat  to 1.5X bw. Bench to 225 and my deadlift to 300+. My long term goal is to put on some more muscle mass (around 20lbs) but in a more controlled fashion. I would also very much like to learn olympic lift so I could translate that speed and explosiveness in boxing.

Did not plan for such a long post!

Thank you guys!

I have had pulled muscles before


7 months later, but still has some issues.  I have slowly started to run, and do very high rep back raises, stuff like that.  Just curious if anyone has had this.

Symptoms
------------------


*All pain shows up on the right side at the very base of my spine*

- Pain with increased intra abdominal pressure.  I started to get worried when it hurt if I laughed too hard

- At first I had unbelievable pain when hanging from a bar and consciously relaxing my abs / back muscles.  This pain is so reliable that I have started using it to gauge my recovery. 

- If I were to do a barbell back squat, I feel it.  Even if I stick my butt out just standing up and no bar or anything, it is painful, if I keep lower back in 1 spot.

- Pain when I having my legs behind me and pulling my hips back.  Think using your feet to scoot a motorcycle back

**TLDR**Now that I read this, and intra abdominal pressure, but the pressure doesn't bother it anymore.

I took the couple weeks off, and running, kept training hard for a couple months, realized I was retarded, took 6 weeks off, tried to start again, pain came back when I hyper extended during an overhead press like a retard.  Took 2 months off and now I have been slowly returning to some stuff.  I am thinking of taking another month or 2 of just versa climber, and things that I find ""safe"" like ""hyper extensions"" (making sure I don't actually hyper extend) with bodyweight and 5 second holds

It's killing me to not train.  I went from 187 at 13 % (I'm only 5'6"" so cut me some slack) to 182 at 18 % bodyfat.  My legs got hella tiny too

I don't know if I buy the stress fracture

And I know already that none of what you say is medical advice

I recently heard, the sensation you feel primarily being the blood moving rather than useful stretching of muscle connection areas.

Anyone have anything to say about this?

I think this was a valid useful question with some downvotes from people who ~~just assumed I was a total noob from using the word ""pumped."" I never indicated that I believe that maximum pump is a training goal.~~ got linked from that other thread. you know

well
&gt;Following on from this, without warming up. The idea behind this is that when warm, the muscles simply elongate and then return to their normal state, whereas stretching a cold muscle will force it to undergo structural changes and increase in length.

Very simply put you need to consume fewer calories than you burn. Exercise helps with this

I think this is just garbage advice for anyone.  The whole fewer calories than you burn simply isn't helpful information for someone trying to lose weight.  The most important things people need to know are (1) that diet is more important than exercise and (2) that your diet needs to include lots of vegetables, and include no [edit: grain-based] carbs (even brown ones) or dairy.  Anyone who understands these can lop off weight at will.  

The calorie in/out thing
