So collectively the moderators here have decided that we want to make some changes regarding the direction of our favorite subreddit. So this is probably going to be the first of a few posts made under this account. You may or may not have noticed this account but basically if you see this account post you need to give it visibility. Self posts aren't worth Karma anyway and we need this stuff to really be at the top of the sub. So really there is no reason not to click the little purple up arrow friend. 

TOPICS we need to discuss include:

* Flair - Flair update is incoming but suggestions will be welcome. This ones pretty straightforward. 

* What to do about Memes / Dog Pictures / Victory spamming - The general consensus here is that we are concerned with the growth of our sub and if it really can handle the volume of some of the recurring topics. There are many solutions to this but we want to hear what you guys think about the pace at which these posts appear here. The general solution we have come up with so far is to have more weekly threads for some of these things. How heavily you want that moderated is up to you guys.

* General attitude - For the most part we are really quite good about things but there is still room for improvement. This place should really encourage the celebration and fandom of our favorite football team. It should not be about whining about other teams and other subreddits. Stop responding to the trolls. Stop downvoting opinions you don't agree with. As long as we all bleed purple we should only downvote things that are irrelevant to our celebration of all that is the Ravens.

* Anything else you want to discuss go ahead and discuss here. Remember we are very very open to your opinion. If you want us to make threads shitting on the browns every week we'll gladly help direct this redundancy... though all kidding aside we want to hear from **you**!

After some discussion we may or may not vote on some things,False,,t5_2s1w8,False,,,t3_1842x3

Playing you guys is scary every year, the heaviness I felt in my heart knowing that our season has come to an end was overpowered by a small light. Secretly, amongst all of us Pats fans at the bar, a quietness fell amongst us as they showed Lewis in all of his emotion. And silently we all agreed that we were happy for him. And a slow clap filled the bar. 

For this years Superbowl

Ray Lewis has been the cornerstone of a defense in the AFC that is the yin to our offenses yang. As much as it pains me to have my Superbowl hopes dashed

From a lifelong Patriots fan. Go purple and black! Go Ray Ray! And go fucking Ravens!!!

I am a Texans fan and my number #2 team in the AFC the Ravens. Now you can downvote me if you want thats fine. But I just ask one thing from you.. lets make sure the Pats/Steelers dont make it past us in the playoffs. Please note I dont speak for all Texans fans.. just myself when I say that. 

Side note: I know you had a tough loss today just like we did last week but I think you are being too hard on yourselves. You are a great team with half of fame players and you WILL make it to the playoffs. Dont let one loss bring you down. Good luck!

I may be only 18 years old, but after briefly having good feelings for shitty Oakland and cheating New England, I realized how disgusting that was and came back to like Baltimore and their elite defense within 2 years.

You may think that a kid from LA doesn't know much about football, playing fantasy football and grabbing Balt D and Ray Rice every year.

Irrelevant background information aside, Billick to Harbaugh, the days where McAlister/Baxter/Boulware were key names on our defense, you name it.  There has been a shit ton of change on our team.  You think we haven't progressed and got by?  I'd argue that for being a consistently good team, we are perhaps the most consistent in shredding a fundamental aspect and changing it.  I see this as a great quality.  Rather than having complete turnovers where we have to wait 10 years for our franchise to turn a new leaf like the Raiders/Lions and what not, we weed out the aging players (McAlister, Johnson, Kruger

When I read the news on Suggs this morning, the cream of the crop.  We find stability in chaos.  That is how the Ravens have worked and always have.

After the heartbreak last year, and they let the fire burn in them.  They put in their work, and they progress behind the scenes, out of the view of the leagues eyes.

When it comes down to it, bye bye Nakamura; we lost consistency - see ya later Grubbs, have fun in SD Jarret.  But what we didn't lose is experience or new blood.  Lewis and Birk and Reed aren't retiring.  Boldin is still here.  Torrey, Flacco, Rice, Webb are all rising stars.  Yanda is a Pro Bowler.  Oher had his slip ups, but he's in a locker room that is going to get him up again

Last year we signed guys like McKinnie who we weren't sure could fill a void that big.  Let's face it

In a couple of weeks, we will continue to do this.  And even after they're gone, they're passing the torch to people like Suggs, Webb, Rice, and Flacco who look to take over as leaders for years to come.

We have talent on our roster.  Don't be afraid.  Suggs does leave a void, and Kruger to step up anyways.  In a way, I see it as a blessing in disguise - not for Suggs or our defense, but for our young guys.  This will ensure they get their experience and playing time to become better players in the future.

Don't worry.  We won't miss a beat.  There is still Lewis, Webb  holding the defense strong in each facet.

We will compete and see how the season goes.  In the end

I understand that its Ray's last Ride, but even more than that, we've seen the lanky-ass, much maligned QB that we all know and love (well not all of us have loved) evolve from a Magikarp  into a Gyarados over the course of a few weeks. Or in plain-speak, we've witnessed ""the Leap"" from Flacco. 

We cannot ignore or understate the fact that Flacco has been putting up numbers that are becoming frighteningly close to Johnny U

We weren't supposed to be here. We were supposed to lose to the Indianapolis Chuckstrongs led by the unflappable Andrew Luck; We were supposed to be massacred by the most balanced team in the NFL

But we didn't. Why you ask? 

Because Joe Flacco

Because Joe Flacco decided that enough was enough. Because he understood that this was the year to make ""The Leap""

Yes, it's been the most united. But for as good as the Defense has played: 9 points for Luck, 21 for Manning, 13 for Tom Brady, this has been Flacco's year. 

Without Flacco, (an aside: Thank God that Pagano has fully recovered and is able to coach again. I have nothing but respect and admiration for him as a coach and as a man) they were in the playoffs two years too early to compete for the AFC championship. 

But Flacco proved his worth in Mile High, with Flacco through sheer willpower alone carrying the team, refusing to let them lose this one. Last year's Ravens would have been decimated, last year's Flacco wouldn't have been able to win that game. 

But this year was different. With 30 seconds left, and throw the most important pass of his career, the greatest pass in Raven's history, a dragon of a pass that fooled everyone with its height and distance. And who but Jacoby Jones, who exorcised his own playoff demons and yips, caught the ball. 

Against the Patriots, the roles were reversed. It was Flacco moving effortlessly downfield, picking apart the Patriots secondary like it was just another day of Practice. 

Flacco's thrown for 853 yards this postseason

All other quarterbacks to throw at least 8 TD's with 0 Int's in the playoffs won Super Bowl MVP. Flacco is in elite company, Aikman, Simms and Drew Brees. 

But Drew Brees didn't have his incredible postseason run on the road

Steve Young and Brees never won a road postseason game

In fact

Flacco's postseason record is now 8-4

Let that sink in: Joe Flacco is one win away from matching Peyton Manning's career playoff wins. Manning playoff suckitude debate aside

Flacco's 2013 postseason run has been legendary. There. I said it. The man is 3 TD's away from tying Montana's 11 TD's. 3 more TD's and he will have tied Montana for the greatest postseason run ever.

Let's take a step back: 

Joe Montana. 

Joe Flacco. 

In the same god damn sentence.

Joe Flacco has a chance to match and surpass Montana for the greatest postseason run ever. He has tied Brees

But the stats are skewed in the new pass-happy NFL Zangestu

Then why is Drew Brees the only QB in this company in the last 20 odd years? Because pass-happy aside

Joe Flacco's 2013 post-season run has been Legen...

wait for it.


Dary.

This may be pre-mature considering we have yet to play the Super Bowl

One more bud. My jersey and my body are ready. 60 minutes from glory

It's our time. Now unleash the Dragon.

Ever since I was little I was raised to hate you, and took all our success with you. You took our rivalry with Pittsburgh, you took it all.

But there's something about you guys. I don't know if it's that you are the real Browns that I was told about from yesteryear, I like you guys. I secretly root for you guys. I almost bought a Ravens jersey, granted it WAS a Troy Smith jersey, but I almost bought one.

I don't know if it's that I like seeing you fight Pittsburgh

Anyways, at least it makes me feel like my team is getting beat up by the hardest divisional opponents in the NFL. 

Sincerely
A Cleveland Browns fan.",,t5_2s1w8,False,,brownsflair,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/ravens/comments/oidhk/im_a_browns_fan_i_have_something_i_need_to_say/

News flash: Making a splash in free agency doesn't necessarily lead to becoming a force in the league.  Before somebody brings up the Heat

* 2012 Los Angeles Angels: Acquire Albert Pujols and C. J. Wilson in free agency.  Acquire Zach Greinke at the trade deadline.  Miss the playoffs.
* 2012 Detroit Tigers: Acquire Prince Fielder in free agency.  Prince + Miguel = let's just call the season off and award them the trophy in January.  The Tigers end up with the 7th best AL record (out of 14 teams) despite playing a large portion of their games against a dogshit division
* 2011 Philadelphia Eagles: Do I need to explain this one? Dream Team and such.  Miss playoffs both years
* 2012-13 Los Angeles Lakers: Kobe and Dwight and Pau and Steve Nash? This game isn't fair let's just have another lockout. I guess I could end up being wrong about this but I can't see anything but a 7- or 8-seed and first-round exit happening.

The common theme to all of these failures is letting present emotions dictate long-term decisions.  I love Ed Reed

So yes, but calmer heads always prevail.  Ozzie is the best in the business, he's done this before, and he will do it again.

I am a Ravens fan because of Ed Reed. Ed Reed is, and as such, the Ravens became my favorite team. Of course, Ray was already there, but since then, the Ravens have added Haloti (from my hometown UofO), Sizzle, Bernard Pollard... Even though great players have left

Anyway, he is leaving his city after giving them one last victory, this time in the Super Bowl. The story could not have been more eloquently written, even by Mr. Poe himself . As this team ages and younger players emerge, I will never forget the first time I saw Ray Lewis play, or the day I say Ed Reed take an interception back out of his own endzone. I love this team. I love these players. I love this game.

1362231479.0,19irz9,First Take: Why Flacco and the Ravens won with this contract. ,Zangestu,64,7,37,"/r Ravens

Joe is a smart guy, ""You're the General now."" Ray told him before the game in Denver where Flacco lead the Ravens to their single greatest postseason victory, the most memorable play in team history, and one of the greatest upsets in NFL history. Flacco led, and the Ravens followed to a massive victory.

But ""Nooo...he's such an average QB."" This is the sort of crap I've been hearing since the post seasons began. ""Flacco and the Ravens didn't play well

Get over it, his offensive line was absolute garbage in those games. 

When the Ravens lose, and a rushing attack that sputtered and stalled. 

Next year, poor Joe Flacco who has matched Rogers in Super Bowls and MVPs and has as many Super Bowl MVP awards as Ryan has playoff wins will be lambasted. 

I laugh at the jealous fans who wish they had Flacco as their QB and a team like the Ravens. I laugh at fans in the league who just like big regular season numbers and contending for the playoffs, in the AFC Championship Game 3 years, and won the Super Bowl now once. That's the highest level of excellence in the league, and we can't let Patriots fans, Bronco fans, Atlanta fans, Green Bay fans, can't do.""

Since 2008, we'll be in this position for the next 10 years.
