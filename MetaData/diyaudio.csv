- Could it be that the vcc and ground lines are too thin?, I don't have an analogue one.
- Are the computer psu's even coping?
- Could the speakers be the source of the problem? one I use is 6 ohms

Tl:dr; Should I be ashamed of my first amp

Edit: Thanks for all of the info and pointers you guys gave me. for now I ordered an analogue multimeter to find out how much the voltage drops at Vcc and to help make an educated guess on capacitor choice for the supply rails. For caps I am aiming for the sweet spot where there is little voltage drop on the rails and no need for a soft-start circuit. 
Right now I'm thinking of adding another PSU  to supply the board with 36V because T-amps like volts. 36V is above the sure rating

I wanted a nice pair of loudspeakers for my desktop rig that I could run off a low-powered amp so I decided on the Overnight Sensation Kit from PartsExpress. These things have got some stellar reviews and they seemed to be priced low enough that I wouldn’t be screwed if I messed up during the building process.

[Here's the album](http://imgur.com/a/yqeOv#MqiB5)

The kit came with just about everything I needed. I also got a 2-pair set of binding posts, solder, electric drill, varnish, wood glue, a roll of 22awg, and a handful of screws.

First were the crossovers. In the instructional video

Now the cabinets. As I said they were already precut perfectly so no need to do much work. I did some light sanding with 200 grit paper. Then I applied some very light varnish to darken the wood a bit. Most other versions of these speakers that I’ve seen used a much darker finish but I wasn’t a big fan and a lighter color matched my desk better. After drying in the sun

I hooked these up and have been running some test tracks and they sound great! These Hi-Vi drivers really pack a punch and the whole frequency range is well represented. Granted

I’d highly recommend this build

The speakers are currently bi-wired. Since the terminology is often misused

What I'd like to do is use the components from my current crossovers and high/low pass the line level signal before it reaches the amplifier. 

However, or would it end up crossing at a different frequency?  Is the impedance level seen by the crossover different now that there's an amplifier between it and the speakers? 

I realize that the acoustic advantages of going this route are probably rather inconsequential

* 14.4V power supply by either Lipo's, or SLA's (leaning towards 12x1.2V NiMH D cells
* I'm going to bi-amp each channel and have a woofer and tweeter for each channel
* Use [this](http://sound.westhost.com/project09.htm) for a line level xover
* Use a TDA7388A for an amp (4x42W @ 4ohm)
* Use car speakers

Now my questions are as follows:

1. The amp: It's expecting the input to be like ~-310 to 310mV (620 peak to peak)

2. For the active xover

3. Where do I find decent speakers for this relatively cheap? (I don't want to bust the bank on this)

4. 4x42W = 168W. How loud is this thing gunna get?

5. The sound.westhost.com site mentions using low tolerance (1%) resistors and caps (don't remember the tolerance for the caps). Is this really necessary?

6. Will a passive xover for the high channel of the biamping part for a mid/tweeter improve quality much? Would 
I run into phase issues?

6. Anything else I should be aware of?

The voltage might mean something to me as far as battery status goes, but it really wouldn't for someone else. The only concern that I have is that it both expensive and it seems difficult to attractively mount in a wooden enclosure.

For years I've used the component cable out of the PS3, to the speakers. Perfectly adequate, but in an apartment, it means cables stretched everywhere, even with decent routing. So, I'm looking for something better.

I have no lack of equipment available: tried a USB headset, same thing. I'd love to be able to pair an Android phone to the PS3 and have it stream the audio; there are several old phones I could use for that. But it doesn't seem like the PS3 is going to do that natively, and I can't seem to find a device that takes 1/8"" stereo input and pushes A2DP audio; most of them take A2DP in from a source like a phone, and push it to the stereo plug.

Any input on this, or bring over to the couch and use regular headphones if it's late. Honestly, I'm ready to just buy a TV, a receiver and some speakers, except that's a lot of money to spend to come out with a much smaller screen in the end (and it seems like it would take a LOT of money to come close to the quality of my old DLP projector).

On the phono channels ONLY there is a persistent low 'roaring' noise accompanied by intermittent clicks / pops.  These can either be frequent or rare enough that I could get through an entire side of an LP without hearing one.  [Here's a recording](https://soundcloud.com/peter-tiso/sx-838-roaring-popping) - note that the actual sound is much lower than this suggests

The volume of this noise increases and decreases with the volume control

Since it was exclusive to the phono channels, no change to the noise.  I also checked the smaller transistors, but haven't gotten into the amplification transistors (possibly using wrong term here; the heat-sinked ones) so that might be a next step.

My question is this: where do we look next?  Should I consider doing a top-to-bottom recapping? This is my first time really ripping into a device like this so any advice is appreciated.

**Update 1-6-2013**

I've managed to completely resolve the issue and

-Tested through the power amp board

-Took enough stuff apart to really get at the switches and volume controls from the back.  Very thorough application of contact cleaner.  This resolved the roaring and popping!  

-Grounding hum wasn't my complaint when I first started out

In terms of usage, I don't have an amplifier, but I may be given an old Onkyo A-8190. Otherwise, I'll be looking to spend $50-75 on one, on top of the $200.

Questions:

1. A pair of OS MTM's  will cost $64 more than its non-MTM counterpart. Is this additional cost justified?

2. If I go with OS MTM or standard

3. How does the sound quality of the Tritrix compare with the two different OS designs? If the Tritrix is significantly better

I took a couple of pictures [Here](http://imgur.com/a/tcWW0#0)


They an RCA plug for the 3 ""surround"" speakers.  That circuit is rated at:

-20W - Music Power

-16 ohm - Impedance 


The ""Main speaker"" has bare wires and is rated at:

-200W - Music Power

-6 ohm - Impedance



Looking up car audio, and 8 ohms.  I also understand basic electricity and audio circuits enough to kinda get that fewer ohms in the circuit = more watts coming out of the speaker.  Although the amp will have a limit/range for acceptable ohms.  Also by doing series wiring or parallel wiring, you can play with the total Impedance some.


I am not sure what to look for in an amp.  I also see that the Watts are rated at ""Music Power"" and that I can estimate the RMS to be somewhere between 1/3 and 1/2 of that figure.

Anyways





**UPDATE**
The speakers have four drivers each.  Two small ""Surrounds"", there is a crossover between the ""surrounds"" and tweeter.  My question is if all the speakers are on one circuit or they are split as illustrated by my [awesome paint skills.](http://imgur.com/a/tcWW0#4)

I recently installed a JVC KD-HDR60 and 4x Pioneer TS-A6874R in my 2002 Ford Windstar using Metra 70-1771 and 4x Metra 72-5600. This was my first car audio project so I made sure to check everything multiple times.

Three hours later I turn on the car and everything works. . . or so I believe. I quickly notice that the volume seems a bit low. I then move the fader to the rear speakers only and realize there is an extremely low level of volume coming from the speakers that I can only hear if I crank the head unit volume to max. Through further troubleshooting

I've done the following to try to troubleshoot:

1 - Move fader to rear speakers only. Volume is insanely low unless I crank the headunit to the max

2 - Put in the old factory speakers in the rear. Issues above persist.

3 - Swap the front and rear speaker connectors on my head unit. Again front speakers play just fine

4 - Ripped the door panels apart to ensure the speakers are connected properly and I haven't mixed the neg/pos lines.

5 - Checked the wiring harness multiple times. All connections are proper. 

At this point I'm lost as to what I need to do and need any help I can get. The almighty Google has thus far failed me as it did state this was common for people with a factory amp

EDIT: So I fixed the issue. A bit of a long story but here it goes.

First off the speakers cutting out when I open the sliding doors was related to the way the speaker system is designed. I found out by opening the panels that the wiring from the speakers/locks go to a four metal pins (two for the speaker and two for the lock) and those pins make contact with a metal plate on the inside of the vehicle that then connect to a series of wires that leads back to the stereo. Awesome huh?

So as for the speaker cutting out. Well I basically just took my multimeter to the back of the stereo and registered 8 ohms evenly on every speaker except the back left which gave a strange reading. I knew that was where the short was

I then had to replace my window regulator/motor because apparently the previous owner decided that instead of paying for a motorcraft motor, separated for all but two strands of copper. I realized this was my short and cut/stripped/crimped some new wire and bam! Not only did I fix my newb mistake of pancaking the sensor/lock wires but I also fixed the speaker short and it has yet to fade for several days!!!",,False,,t5_2tizz,1338018422.0,,

I pretty much followed [This](http://tangentsoft.net/audio/cmoy-tutorial) word for word

Let me elaborate - there is a small amount of noise on relatively low impedance headphones when the source is silent and the volume is cranked up max. I used the default gain of 11 when building it, I don't have a large to small Headphone adapter to test my big cans with yet. 

I'm assuming though that even though I will be amping further on 300ohm cans, there is no hiss, and the music is at comfortable listening volumes. Am I right in assuming that on 300ohm cans at 100% source and say 60% cmoy volume that the hiss will be just as quiet relative to the music?

What really surprises me however is that it is absolutely silent if there has been no music playing since turning the amp on. If I pause music and remove the source jack, since I'm curious)

After some googling this appears to be the manifestation of a very common problem with this series of NAD amplifier; the contacts on the speaker relays are dirty or corroded. Because the relays are sealed I can't get any deoxit in there to clean the contacts properly so I'm left with replacing them completely.

From forums I have pretty much narrowed down which relay I need to use as a replacement but **here is my problem**: 

 The replacement relays will have a different coil resistance than the stock relays. There is a resistor in the relay circuit that I can change to account for the change in relay resistance but I'm not sure how to calculate the value of the new resistor. I know it should just come down to some Ohm's law stuff but I'm a civil engineer

[Here is close up of the relay circuit](http://i.imgur.com/l7ZkL.jpg)

Relays RL401 &amp; RL402 are the ones being replaced. They are Taiko PX-2405. Coil Resistance of 500 ohms. [Here is the datasheet](http://www.farnell.com/datasheets/96208.pdf)

[Here is the planned replacement.](http://www.mouser.com/ProductDetail/Omron-Electronics/G2R-2A-DC24/?qs=sGAEpiMZZMtSzCF3XBhmWz1dWWR22LTv3UP9bVW%252b41U%3d) This has a coil resistance of 1100 ohms.

R413 is the resistor in question. It has a resistance of 470 ohms.

C417 is a .01 micro farad cap and D401 is a diode. I don't know much about these except that changing them was never discussed in any of the forums I've read.

4. Hands free calling is something I would like to have in this car. Though I currently just use speakerphone and thats fine if it can be integrated I would like to do so.

What is the easiest way to replace the stock head unit to allow usage of my Nexus' headphone jack to be the audio source? I assume there is something I can use that would allow me to utilize the stock speakers etc without having to purchase an expensive amp setup.

How can I integrate hands free calling into this? perhaps routing the calls through google talk or another app that would let me use my tablet as a ""headset"".

Should I just use the 12v regulator (the plug that it comes with) and hook that up to the battery? Or should I get some other kind of regulator?

I have always wanted to brighten it up a little bit. I've always been a huge fan of Klipsch speakers

I have two basic questions: 

1. Will installing a higher sensitivity driver help to increase the tweeter output and therefore treble? I am nervous that this may muddle the sound though too in the lower tweeter Fqs.

2. What wattage should be fine for the driver? I have yet to test the original drivers impedance with a multi-meter but this is just a general question. Most of the drivers on Parts-express are only good to ~35watts RMS. Is this normal for tweeters? My speaker is rated to 150 Watts RMS if memory serves (but its been a while).

The calculations that I had were:
* width:28
* height 1:14
* height 2: 8
* depth: 14
so using 3/4 inch mdf it would give a volume of 1.89395 cu ft. The two angles on the wedge would be 67.52 and 112.48 degrees.  The two recessions to hold the amps would be a total of .29505 cu ft.  The speaker displaces .049 cu ft.  The port that I think is the right size would be 1X12 and 22.3"" in length so would displace .27505 cu ft.
So 1.89395-.29505-.049-.27505= about 1.275 cu ft.

* Overheating.  I don't think this is the problem but I honestly don't know
* problems with the electrolytic capacitors
* something with amps.  I don't know anything about this option.

I have two questions:
1) Would all these problems cause signal loss between the input device and the speakers? If not
2) What order should I tackle the problem?
