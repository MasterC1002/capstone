So, so the Columbus store is like twenty minutes away. I wish I could share my employee discount, but it's pretty crappy on large items anyways. However, if anyone plans on doing some cable management, I get a steal on cables and extensions, and MAY just happen to use my discount to buy them for me then decide I don't need them anymore, before I even open them (Major hint hint right there)

.

.


**How it'll work...**

1. Browse the sales on /r/buildapcsales or [Microcenter's Online ad](http://www.microcenter.com/specials/catalogs/index.html) to figure out what you want.
2. on Microcenter.com
3. Send me a message with what you'd like (including the cart
4. Once paypal payment is received, and ship them out. (I plan to make a trip there at least once a week. Once I ship them, we'll figure out the exact shipping and give/take as needed)

**Why?** You may ask. Well, I've got college expenses to pay for, so any **tips are greatly appreciated :)**

no prob man. :)

Seems like a swell guy huh? Nope. I even offered him more money later on, really want this GPU. After I send the money I see that the Paypal I sent it to is under a different name, I canceled before he accepted. I knew he was scamming me but there was a little piece of me saying ""What if this is legit? this will complete your rig"" so as per usual I didn't follow my gut and continued with the process. So stupid of me. To get straight to the point days pass and there is no sign of him. I've made multiple attempts to contact him VIA Steam, Email, ect. No luck. At this point I knew it was all over, I sent one last PM.

He deleted his account a few minutes later. 

So you think I can go get my money back, ding!, ding! it's allll over folks! So what can you do to prevent this?

1. Link your Paypal to your bank account and send money that way. This way your bank can get your money back. Trust me

2. If you're unable to send money through a bank account PAY THE 4%

3. If it at all feels like you're getting too good of a deal

Hey /r/hardwareswap

I took the plunge and built my dream Intel rig. Now I'm trying to recoup some of the cost by selling all this AMD/budget build stuff. I've never sold anything on this sub

Ideally I could sell the entire build(other than one of the CPU's obviously) in one shot, whether you have gear or would like to make a cash offer.

Stuff I'm interested in:

Mouse: If you had a Mionix Naos 8200

Keyboard: Currently own a CM Quickfire Rapid. Works perfectly fine expect that I don't like the brown switches very much and it's not full sized(no num pad)

Monitor: I have a 60 Hz 1080p monitor around 21.5""(?). If you've got a better one

If you've got any questions just ask and I'll do my best to answer them.

And a [ringing but odd endorsement](http://i.imgur.com/xe7Sbkt.png) from /u/manirelli.  [Another endorsement from Jocelyn](http://geekhack.org/index.php?topic=44153.msg927517#msg927517) over at Geekhack and Overclock.net.  I sent her three different cables, and aqua blue ones pictured in this thread.

So what we are looking for is as follows:

* Any harddrives that have very limited size (10-20gb).  Something that you still have lying around just because it was useful at some point and time.

* Used case fans- anything that makes an annoying rattle or other noise.  Again something you couldnt bring yourself to throw out but do not have an active use for at the moment.  Mismatched colors and/or LED lights are a plus!

* A PSU.  This we actually want to be of decent quality.  We require something around 600w range.  If it is ugly all the better.  Does not have to be state of the art

* Older GPU.  Right now we have an 8500gt that is okay to use in the build

* Any additional trolling suggestions are much appreciated. 

Here is the list of parts that we have:

**Case**- Thermaltake Commander MS/1 Snow Edition

**Motherboard**- Asus P5GC-MX/1333

**CPU**- Intel e2200

**RAM**- 2x1 gb DDR2 PC2 5300


Just to reiterate we are looking for parts that are annoying but still usable. Also

1347828122.0,zzja4,[PSA] Guide to Safe Trading,bravokiloromeo,14,2,5,"I'm a frequent online hardware trader on HardForum, which led me to notice that there isn't enough information about safe trading practices (for buyers and sellers) made public to users here

I'm going to run through a basic list of things you *should* do as a buyer or seller when trading. 

**EDIT - Remember

You can choose to ignore or uphold as much of this as you want

**Trading Feedback/Reputation:**

- If you are a regular trader, here is my heatware profile.](http://www.heatware.com/eval.php?id=75353)

- eBay feedback is ok at best. The problem with eBay's system is that you cannot rate buyers anything other than positive, and for judging *sellers only*. [Example](http://feedback.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewFeedback2&amp;userid=757boilermaker90&amp;ftab=AllFeedback)

- Some forums have built-in feedback systems. These are generally very solid as long as you can provide a link between the forum and reddit (will vary by scenario). You generally won't run into this

- Some other equivalents to heatware exist (beer is another one I've heard of) but most people use heatware if anything. I would discredit a feedback profile if the user **BOTH** has not been active for several years *and* only has a few transactions. Some traders go dormant

**General Trading Practices For Buyers**

- **ALWAYS** ask for photographs of an item, have the seller provide pictures of the screen while holding said piece of paper. If the item is being sold with noted flaws, it is not improper to ask for better pictures of the flaws. Pictures are **non-negotiable** unless you're trading with somebody you trust (which should be absolutely *nobody* but people you know personally). [Example](http://i1123.photobucket.com/albums/l554/bravokiloromeo/Toshiba%20Portege%20R835-P56X/IMG_0064.jpg)

- **ALWAYS** ask about condition of items. Transactions through Paypal &amp; Amazon Payments assume 'as-is' sales, and their trading reputation will reflect that. 

- **ALWAYS** ask for some form of feedback (heatware

- **ALWAYS** use a secure method of payment with some sort of dispute mitigation service like [Paypal](www.paypal.com) or [Amazon Payments](payments.amazon.com) (I believe Serve and Dwolla also have it, since you can file a chargeback through your credit card company in the event of a scam. 

- **DO NOT PAY AS A GIFT OR THROUGH NON-PROTECTED MEANS** (also against Paypal's Terms of Service). There have been traders asking for payment in Newegg credit (or the like)

- **USPS Money Orders are ok in SOME instances.** Some traders on the bigger trading forums will ask for USPS Money Orders

- Get as much personal info as possible if you feel extra wary. Name, etc. More documentation will save you hassle in the long run. A lot of experienced traders will ask to speak to newer traders over the phone simply to verify and get a feeling for the trader's demeanor. This doesn't usually happen when you're buying an item, but you may encounter it. 

- Once the deal has been struck

- **INSURANCE IS ON THE SELLER, since they should/will refund you if the item is damaged or doesn't arrive (you can still file a claim/dispute even if they refuse to refund you). If you are asked to pay for the extra insurance fee and you refuse, you are still well within your rights to file a dispute/claim in the end. 

- When the item arrives, but if you receive an item not as described, **THE BURDEN IS NOT ON YOU, IT IS ON THE SELLER**.

- If the item doesn't arrive within a reasonable timeframe (will vary on shipment method/company used), and will usually automatically escalate to a claim. Once it reaches claim status, the payment organization will adjudicate to determine who is at fault and the punishment. **MORE DOCUMENTATION IS ALWAYS BETTER**, and feel free to make phone calls to the organization regarding the claim. Sometimes Paypal's system will automatically make judgements (like if the seller forgot to update the item as 'shipped' in Paypal) and talking to someone over the phone is an easy way to prevent any incorrect judgements.

- *No matter how things turned out*, since it says a ton about a trader's character). Neutrals are for ones that went slightly sour, but ended up working out (i.e. difficult trader who was reluctant or lazy to follow through on some stuff). These are usually subjective and serve as warnings. Negatives are for trades that went absolutely terribly and resulted in extreme hassle for both parties and/or scams. Leave all appropriate information in the heatware review - people will want to know what happened so they can take necessary measures.

**General Trading Practices For Sellers**

- Provide pictures and an accurate description of your item. Buyers should/will ask, so do your best to provide photographs of damaged sections.

- Provide references/feedback. As a seller, you will do things differently."" – Warren Buffett 

- Sign up for [Paypal](www.paypal.com) or [Amazon Payments](payments.amazon.com). If you have enough feedback

- When shipping an item, as these go through rollers and scanners, and items can be torn out of them very easily. 

- USPS is great for small items. Flat rate boxes are great for small &amp; heavy items, etc. Shipping speed is dependent on what you work out with the buyer. I use First Class for small items (under 13 oz), Priority for some in between sized items under 3 lbs, and Priority Flate Rate boxes for bigger ones. I would use UPS for anything over 3 lbs and not in a flat rate box, since USPS will charge you out the a$$.

- **If you use Paypal and USPS**

- **If you do NOT use Paypal, but you do not need to use Paypal during the transaction to use this function. 

- **INSURANCE IS YOUR ONLY PROTECTION DURING THE SHIPPING PHASE**. The buyer is already protected under the payment method, so chipping in an extra $5 on a $400 item is definitely worth the security. 

- When actually shipping the item, but that's hit or miss depending on your location. **If the item doesn't make it into the shipper's system, do NOT expect to be protected even if you purchased insurance.**

- Notify the buyer that their item is on the way. This is just general courtesy

- If you hit a snag (emergency, and if you foresee this emergency causing problems with the trade it is best to cancel/refund up front. People get upset if you disappear on them with your money, and will often leave neutral/negative heatware as a result. 

- Keep tabs on the item, and if you call you can bring to their attention the unwillingness to provide evidence of neglect on your behalf.

- Once the trade is completed, contact the guys at heatware and provide them with details and evidence of the trade and they will remove the negative from your account. **IF YOU LEAVE A RETALIATORY FEEDBACK, IT WILL NOT BE REMOVED**.

**Other Things I Didn't Mention Above**

- Be courteous and professional, and I will always uphold my end of the bargain. However, if it's not my fault it is not my problem.

- If it sounds too good to be true

- **PHOTOS PHOTOS PHOTOS** If an item is delicate

- **KEEP ALL DOCUMENTATION** This includes photos, etc. If something starts to go south, don't be afraid to copy text from entire sale threads, or even screenshots (probably a better bet since it will have aspects of your PC in the shot as well and thereby proving it's existence in the event the OP decides to delete the thread or their association with it). More evidence is always better when settling claims, and don't be afraid to contact people involved in the claims process to provide them this evidence. It is a hassle, but it will only hurt you in the end to be lazy. 

- Be smart. Don't trade internationally (some people are legitimately trying to buy stuff overseas; they aren't *all* Nigerian Princes) unless you want to deal with it. I have shipped items overseas (non-trading) before and it is an absolute pain in the ass, go wrong.

- **IF AT ANY POINT YOU FEEL UNCOMFORTABLE** find a way to fix it. It is easy to ask for more info about the other trader, you can always back out; sure it will piss some people off, but there's nothing they can do about it. *If payment/items have been exchanged it is too late*. Some sellers might be nice about the issue and will accept a return as long as you pay return shipping, but this is **never guaranteed nor required of the seller**. 


If you read this far

If you came looking for a TL;DR

**I hope this can be permanently attached to /r/hardwareswap and other trading forums in a very public place. The sidebar is just that - a sidebar - and it is very out-of-the-way for people to read. I understand that people need to go out of their ways to trade safely

This post has been a long time in the making and as such I apologize for the delay.  Within the past couple months we have seen some users scammed and other trades fall through.  I'd like to know what you think we as moderators should do to try and both protect users and improve the subreddit.

We've already seen a few suggestions such as always requiring pictures and possibly making Heatware mandatory.  Additionally

There are a lot of good ideas out there and we would like to hear them.  Please upvote this post for visibility.

If you are curious about where all this stuff has been / come from

1) All of this stuff was purchased for bitcoin mining back in May 2011. It's all been faithfully mining in my spare bedroom since then, so it's gotta go! [photo 1](https://dl.dropbox.com/u/3832397/Photos/2011/May/IMG_20110520_150522.jpg) [photo 2](https://dl.dropbox.com/u/3832397/Photos/2011/May/IMG_20110525_034107.jpg)


2) These used to be the monitors I used on my main desktop. I decided to upgrade to 2560x1440 monitors


3) Used to be the power supply in my main PC


4) Bought this for bitcoin experimentation but never ended up using it. It got took out of the box and I looked at it


5) These are great fun especially for the price


6) Used to use this as my fan controller but switched to a couple of BitFenix recons because I fan control in software. Looks really cool though. Shame I can't have this and software control really! :P


7) Used to be my old gaming PC, will test it before I send it off.

The above system is for sale, and it includes an HD4870 as a video card. Also not included above is the price of the screen, which ran about $50 for the screen itself and $30 for the adapter kit. It's got handle mounted to the top, as you can see in the pics, and is great for LAN parties, or just having a decent PC you can carry around. Also includes mini-microphone and all accessories. Oh, and the keyboard mounts to the back of the case with velcro.
A video of the PC can be found here: http://youtu.be/h45N8IJNINI

[Here is a link](http://www.reddit.com/r/gamingpc/comments/wufyi/in_homage_to_the_prodigy_build_posted_a_few_hours/) to the build over on /r/GamingPC. Includes pictures and specs.

The only thing I've changed is that the 200mm fan has been replaced with a much better one that is now mounted to the front of the case on the exterior. It doesn't look terribly ugly

Why am I selling this? Really the objective for this build for me was to build an extremely capable gaming machine with the smallest footprint possible. Packing an overclocked Ivy Bridge i7 and GTX 690

Included is every internal component on the spec list, so 3.5"" HDDs are pretty much out of the question. There is a cage on the right panel that holds two 2.5"" SSDs or laptop HDDs. Also note that the motherboard has two eSATA ports on the back, and a pretty good number of USB 3.0 ports, making external storage a viable option.

For specific reasons, I need a much more mobile desktop (airplane carry-on small).  Since I'm going the mini-ATX route, I decided to build a new computer from the ground up.

And that, please do!  (I'd also appreciate a heads-up if I'm underselling too!)

I love my computer but it's not practical for my needs anymore. ***I prefer to sell as a package deal but I'd be willing to negotiate smaller package deals or individual sales.  All prices are negotiable within reason.***

I loosely based my prices off of used prices I found online and what I hope is common sense.  Without further ado:

* Thermaltake Armor + (ATX Full-Tower Chassis) - $50.00 (I love this thing)
* EVGA e-GeForce 8800 GTS 640MB PCI-E - $35.00
* Gigabyte GA-965P-DS3 Rev. 3.3 - $50.00
* Zalman Copper CPU Fan - $15.00 (I also love this for some reason)
* 2 120-mm fans - $5
* DVD ROM - $5
* CD-RW - $5
* Associated connections - value not considered
* Intel Core 2 Quad CPU Q6600 2.4GHz - $50.00
* 4GB (2x2GB) DDR2 G.Skill RAM - $20.00
* Note: You will have to provide your own HDD and PSU or I can purchase new ones for you (which will adjust the price).
* **Total** (depressing) price for all computer parts: $235 local price + up to $95 U.S. shipping and packaging, MN would cost $60.  I also consider local within about 100 miles for all the computer parts, but I'm also flexible with that number. ~~&lt;---**EDIT 1:** Includes the price of the TV~~

* **EDIT 2:** [Samsung LNT4671F 46-Inch 1080p 120Hz LCD TV](http://imgur.com/a/YEy2i), shipping cost (excluding packaging) to St. Paul, MN would cost $215.  I also consider local within about 350 miles for the TV, but I'm also flexible with that number.

I just wanted to point out that the Samsung TV is awesome, as it's kind of difficult to think about its original price when 120Hz was the new rave (I bought it new from Best Buy at $2800).~~

Lastly, but I'm sure they still represent the product sufficiently (if not, just ask for more!)  Also, the currently installed GPU is not the one for sale.

The MSI 7850 was purchased along with the Silverstone Strider Plus 500W in July 2012. It was replaced under warranty in February 2013 for an issue that had been present the entire time I owned it, but introduced a new issue with the HDMI port only. I am including the HDMI to Mini displayport cable that I purchased to work around this issue ([this one](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B009K62HQ0/ref=oh_details_o04_s00_i00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1)). The card functions perfectly through both MDP and DVI.[Newegg](

I needed to run some wires into my case, but if it bothers you, sorry. :(. Also specifically, the issue with the HDMI port only comes up when trying to run a full screen game, artifacts appear. Games run in a window fine, and full screen videos work fine, but certain games have issues running full screen. Again

I would be looking for around £90. Having said this, I would be happy to barter. 

* GTX580 1.5GB
* Full-tower gaming case
* A socket 1155,
* SSD/HDD
* Offers.


The brand of graphics card is XFX. I bought the old version (has since been re-designed - and for good reason) which had a terrible fan/heatsink. To be fair to the cooling, it was the casing that was the issue. It was a generic fan right at the end of the card, with a big bulky plastic case. This meant that when I tried to push the GPU by running Skyrim (at pretty high detail) it would max out at 97C and BSOD my PC. This happened several times before I went out and bought an aftermarket cooler. The cooler I bought is an Arctic Cooling Accelero Twin Turbo Pro. I bought the card for ~£150 and the cooler was around £40-50 at the time (and a lot of hassle getting it on), and I believe both products are around the same price as of right now. Despite this, I have made the price kind of low for several reasons:

* The model. Since, they are, generally speaking, much more attractive all-round in terms of power consumption, performance, power-to-cost and cooling. I'm assuming this would be similar with the 7000 series, so I'm going to also assume that my 6870 would be now becoming obsolete

* I don't have the original box nor any of its included peripherals. I only have the installation disk

* Shipping. I realise a lot of the posters on this subreddit are from the US. I would be expecting you to pay the shipping price

* **MINOR FAULTS**. This isn't something which bothered me when I used the card, mainly on the desktop. This would happen (if I recall correctly) immediately after booting up, and would disappear (for the most part) in a few minutes. However, I do remember there were a couple that were stubborn and would stay around for much longer - although I seem to recall I mainly only ever saw it on white webpages (mainly, the background of YouTube) and on the desktop. **HOWEVER**, I've changed monitors, graphics cards and motherboards since then, but I felt I should mention it anyway.

* 500GB Hard Drive
* 6GB of RAM with one open expansion slot left

* unlocked the GPU to be able to overclock through CCC
* Have flashed BIOS to most recent firmware
* repasted GPU personally using Arctic Silver 5 paste
* have always used most current drivers (although HDD will be wiped if sold)

Decided to sell this for a smaller laptop for college and build myself a desktop. Spent ~$1400 on the laptop new. Looking for maybe ~$900 **OBO**.

 I ended up paying $300 for it because it included a 1TB HDD and Windows Home Server (**not 2011**). **The HDD is not included here.**

Here is a chance for someone who just bought in for a 760 and realized that they'd rather have more power. I'm offering you an easy upgrade! It'd be awesome if someone did this. I'm currently building an amazing FT03-Mini build and I need a reference design EVGA.

I'm also willing to take an SSD along with the card. As long as it's a current gen SSD

Both parties will pay shipping at own expensive. I'll probably dish out a bit more so it arrives faster

* The top was damaged a little when cutting the 4x120mm hole so it was repainted. Doesn't look perfect
* cut hole in bottom for 2x120mm fans(no fan grill here)
* removed both HDD cages(plenty of space to add a new cage in either the old cage space or 5.25"" bays)
* cut hole in rear side panel for 120mm fan and added mesh grill
* replaced power and HDD LED with orange LED instead of the stock white

* Ebay: Nominal listing fees. People may be hesitant to buy from you if you don't have a lot of Ebay feedback points. (""A++++, great personal hygiene, etc."")

* Amazon: Similar to Ebay. Not sure if dispute resolution is better or worse for sellers. You are required to offer a return policy. Not sure if this is good or bad. Reputation may matter less. You don't want people to use your stuff and return it normally

* Craigslist: No fees, or lugging your computer somewhere else.

This is in brand new condition.  I pulled it out of the box, but the build quality is as good or better.    I'm also tossing a pair of 120mm Cougar Vortex, Cooljag Everflow, or sleeved Swiftech Helix fans in.  I haven't decided which pair to add yet, but all but the Swiftechs are PWM.  Right now it's going for [$112 shipped at Newegg](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16811345019) and [$100+shipping at NCIX](http://us.ncix.com/products/?sku=73006) and I'm adding in $20-30 worth of fans, so I think $100 shipped is more than a fair price.

I can also sleeve the front panel connectors in gray MDPC-X for a small fee if you want them sleeved.

From my history you can see that I am an established redditor. If you also pop over to /r/gameswap you can also see that I have a few successful trades including actually mailing physical copies of games.

If you have any questions or would like pics please send me a PM and I will see what we can do. Payment will be accepted via paypal (non gift) and GPU will be sent certified.

Side note: I am really posting this card because I am hoping that someone who has been wanting to build a rig can start with a pretty good GPU for a good price. You should be aware this card has some negatives. It is POWER HUNGRY so don't think you will be able to run it will a 400w psu. I have been using an OCZ 600w psu and have had zero problems.

Does not come with a hard drive, and don't have much use for a heavy power hungry laptop.  Chargers for this go from $30-$60.  Functionally it works fine, and while I could turn it on with a charger with lower voltage and amperage, it could affect the hardware and make it more prone to breaking in the future and I don't want to do that with respect to whoever buys it.  The laptop itself came with stupid doors on the sides that covered the ports on the sides (maybe ASUS was afraid of dust) but they quickly broke and are now missing.  A piece of plastic which is supposed to cover the connection between the screen and GPU is also missing.  Some screws on the bottom are also missing but the panels have no problem staying on.


Important Specs:  
CPU:     Dual core Intel P8700 processor that runs stock at 2.53 Ghz but the ASUS TurboGear software can automatically overclock it to about 2.90 Ghz.  You can use SetFSB to overclock it higher with clockgen 9LPRS929AKLF.

Most of the keys have a white LED behind them while the rest have a green LED behind them. As stated in the title the keys are Cherry MX Reds. The keyboard has been lightly used for about 3 months, it has been collecting dust as I no longer use it. I figured someone else could use it more than me.

Yes

Case is easily big enough to handle 3 video cards

Has not been modded, but assuming you have a video card, you don't need them all anyhow. It has a ton of screws/misc hardware as well. It's missing 2x 120mm fans (the loud stock ones), but I've thrown in a Noctua 140mm intake fan. Assuming you're interested in this case, you probably have a ass-load of gentle typhoons to spare.
Here's the deal: This beast is heavy (30ish lbs), bring me some cash, and I will send you on your merry way. Case is located in Park Slope.

I also have a nice little XFX 6950. Yes, and if you know why that's important, I can tell you with some mild overclocking (~950ish mhz) it was getting 381 MH/s. Also plays games well, ran Skyrim with everything maxed except the grass distance over 50 FPS. I would rather **not** ship this either.

PM me if interested.

The story: This card was originally for sale at the computer store I frequent for a cool $90. I bought it because it was a good deal at the time (about a year or so ago) and it would be a good backup card to have. My brother then sold his GTS 450 and used this in his computer as a temporary card while he saved/researched a new one. It ran everything like a champ


Then, I went ahead and returned it. It sat on the shelf for months because the owner didn't RMA it (even though it was within warranty).


Fast forward a few months. I found a 4850 512MB at Goodwill for $4 (it was in a 6950 box


I took it apart, and voila, it posts. I tried Ubuntu just to install an OS and see if the card would overheat, and it eventually reached 70^o C because the fan stayed at idle. I upgraded my PSU from a 600w with two 6-pins to a 620w with a 6-pin and a 6+2-pin. I installed Windows 7 and Afterburner, set the fan to 40%, and it stayed at a cool 35^o to idle. It ran perfectly fine for hours and hours (even overnight) with no artifacts or crashes or anything. But then as I attempted to install Catalyst and such to mess with the Crossfire settings, it BSOD'd. Now, artifacts come up on the screen.


As I said


It comes with the original box and all the original accessories (minus the power cables

The second one is the current generation like [this](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16823201040) one.

If you're not aware, they are pretty much identical.

I'm selling the first gen because I replaced it with my second gen. I'm selling my second gen because I'm replacing it with the [white](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16823201052) version of the RK-9000.

The first gen had a slight case of chattering keys. Pressing some of the keys would result in two key presses instead of one. I've used it quite a bit recently and haven't experienced the issue again

The second gen one is in perfect working order. The area along the keyboard under the space bar is a little shiny from my thumb, or take off depending on what you want (though I did a pretty bad job on it... So taking it off is probably a good idea :P). Also I use my own keycaps for the board so the key caps that it will ship with it are hardly used. Oh, and the feet are plastidipped so that it doesn't slide around on the desk. Also removable upon request (though I would definitely keep that on).


I won't be shipping either keyboard until early January

[Here](http://imgur.com/a/mwsBp) are the photos of the keyboards as-is. They will both be getting a thorough cleaning when I switch the keycaps over to my new board.

I run an iPhone repair business. My friend sold me his cracked White iPhone 4S that was used for AT &amp; T. I fixed the front an back screen with brand new glass quality panels. I use the highest quality parts to fix them. Everything works 100% and I can guarantee that no screws or parts were missed in the operation. In the event that the phone has any defects in the next 6 months, LCD issues). I'm that confident in how well the phone works. The only visible damage is scratches on the metal frame of the phone. I'll include a screen protector and case and a charger. 


The phone is unlocked

I also have a Dell U2311H Ultrasharp monitor that I purchased from another seller from HWS about 2 months ago. It has a slight line in the middle of the screen


**SOLD** ~~Price: **$100** Shipped~~



I am also looking for a full PC or parts to make a cheap mATX or compact gaming system. Cases, APUs, mid tier GPUs, and small cases: all that good stuff to make a game sufficient to run modern games at competitive frame rates.

The Mini-SAS will run any SATA drive with a cable available from newegg or just about anywhere else.

These two are run against a single run of the mill WD Velociraptor. No raid, you can see the reads are fairly impressive.

Accessories:

2x like new 360 controllers (the official ones)

all cables

2x Guitar Hero guitars (one is from guitar hero aerosmith

1x cheap third party headset w/ a glowing led in the mic piece

Condition:

Every thing works flawlessly. Never had any issues with the console or any of the games/accessories! I also have the original 360 box with all docs that come with it. Every retail game is in a solid original game case as well!

Also have an Acer Revo 1600 in perfect condition. It's an amazing little nettop pc that I currently have XBMC Ubuntu installed and use it as a media server. I just dont use it as much since I use my 360 for hulu/netflix etc. You can install any OS on it though and do whatever you want with it. Comes with power cords

and lastly I have a Microsoft Zune 80gb mp3 player. It's nice! The silver piece around the touch control on the front is a little scuffed but it works perfectly. Includes the proprietary usb cable.

What I want: Any PS3 systems/game combos and perhaps other offers as well. I have found that I have many acquaintances who play on 360 and I have Live Gold

I want any PS3 offers for consoles in similar condition

Let me know what you have if you are interested.

I have completed one trade on a previous reddit account that I dont use anymore at /r/gameswap w/ username http://www.reddit.com/user/mikesuds I can login to that one to confirm with you that I am who I say I am!

The above system is for sale, which ran about $50 for the screen itself and $30 for the adapter kit. In addition, I am including an HD4870 GPU, which is not listed above. It's got handle mounted to the top, as you can see in the pics, and is great for LAN parties, or just having a decent PC you can carry around. Also includes mini-microphone and nano-USB wireless-N adapter. In addition I can throw in a pair of decent Logitech desktop speakers. Oh

* Logisys 750w power supply

And because I have no intention of screwing someone over here's some of the games that I play and their performance.

* WOW: ultra settings

* Batman Arkham city: High settings  get decent FPS

* SWTOR: max settings

* Battlefield 3: playable in high settings but more suited for medium.  

* Skyrim: settings on high is very enjoyable.  good mix between FPS and visual goodness.  

* Rift: max settings

* Saints row the third: I think this game is more reliant on processor power.  even on minimal settings there was unenjoyable performance. 

* LA noire: I would know how this played it if i ever got the damn game to install properly.

This would cost about $1050 new with current prices and I paid something around $1150. I'm hoping to get around $900 but I'm not really expecting to get close to that number.

So give me some offers.

There are a few things that I should mention right away


----------


 • All Payments WILL go through Paypal no exceptions.  I do not have any other services setup and don't plan on doing so.

 • All prices are Shipped if you live within the US48

 • If you receive a graphics card and for some reason it is not working

 • If you do need to return the card due to it being faulty within the 30 days

 • I will wait till I receive the card and check it to make sure it is indeed faulty before refunding any money.  If the card still works

 • No negotiating the price down

 • I would LOVE to be able to wait till all the cards are sold before I ship them out.  However

 • I will wait 1 week from the day someone wants to buy something before I ship it.  I will not ship it until the money has been transferred to my Paypal account.

 • If you have any questions about the cards

There, Grid 2, XCOM, World of Tanks, Bioshock Infinite, etc...)



I also receive my GTX 295's from a fellow OCN member as well.  These cards were once used for folding@home and have incurred many MANY points on them for a good cause.  They are basically OCN memorabilia if you think about it.  But in no way does that change the price of them.  I picked these up for $125(shipped) a piece at the time and used one in a spare rig for when a friend came over and the other... well



All of the cards are most likely not under warranty anymore, it never ends well)).  The HD 7970 does come with the box and most(if not all) of the accessories.  The GTX 295's however do not have boxes or accessories with them.  For more information about the cards specifics, please click o it and you will be brought to it's main webpage.  The main reason behind me selling these cards is due to the fact that I need to purchase a 7990 for a mITX build I will be doing in the future.  Please ask any additional questions that you may have.

i also have a 320 GB HDD i can include


i don't overclock it, i've had it up to 4.7 Ghz for the CPU and had the GPU up to a GHz. no real need though, it's pretty overkill for a single 1080p screen.

the PC partpicker list shows the video card as the Flex2. mine is actually the original Sapphire Flex

asking $700 or as close to that as i can get. i need 2 grand to put down on this car

Unfortunately this great card has a known issue with the ball bearing in the fan wearing out. Three months ago the bearing gave out and I've had to resort to maxing the fan speed while holding the fan center with a pen (real ghetto I know). This card is very capable as is and with a 30 dollar case with two big fans or a cheap watercooling system would be up and running and definitely capable of overclocking.

Some notes:
Video Cards were purchased last April, and has barely been used.  Everything else is in excellent condition, with pictures available upon request, though please only request pics if you are genuinely interested in something, as I'd like to avoid taking her apart until components are ready to go to a new home.
