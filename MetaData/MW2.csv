1. The red dot on your radar which shows the location of an enemy is dimmer if the enemy is under something. That is

2. The big warehouse by A on Quarry can see just about the entire map. It is perfect for sniping and picking off people at long range.

3. Holding down a position is not camping. Sitting in a random corner waiting for people to walk by is. If you're afraid you're camping, I know exactly how to kill him. Camping is not a good strategy, but it annoys people because it's just fucking annoying to get killed by a little bitch waiting in a corner. Staying in a building killing people out of windows, however, is not camping; it's how you win the game.

4. The FAL is a 2 hit kill within range even without stopping power.

5. FMJ does not make your bullets hurt more. It just decreases the amount of damage they lose going through surfaces.

6. Silencer + heartbeat sensor = deadly

7. Don't neglect LMGs. I recently started using the L86 and I currently have more kills with it than any other gun this prestige. It will not lose in a head on engagement, and their only disadvantage to assault rifles is the lack of mobility. As long as you don't try to run around and you just stick to holding down positions, no assault rifle can match your firepower.

1287511442.0,dtfin,A warning about GameBattles,Aceroth,62,13,58,"**tl;dr My team submitted indisputable proof of our win in round 1 of the summer season playoffs and it was completely ignored by GB admins.**

Those of you who may be thinking about playing competitively on gamebattles

The Method (the team I'm on) played our first full season this past summer. We did pretty well for a new team, something incredibly unjust and absurd happened. We were supposed to play a team (Habitual Killers) who ended the season somewhere around 30th on the ladder (we were just shy of 100th). We set up the lobby, invited their leader, and were about to start the game, but they didn't have 4 players available. The rules for the playoffs state that each team must have 4 players to play the match, and if a team shows up without the appropriate number of players, they must forfeit the match. So we waited for the allotted 15 minutes after the match start time (even a little longer), so we closed the lobby and submitted a ticket requesting their forfeit.

We tried to contact GB live support because we know this team has refs on their roster and might try to cheat the system. They were even bragging before the match that they've never lost a dispute because of this. However, though, because we submitted a ticket with our proof as well.

But, with the following admin message:

""Since the Asst Head Referee went into the match late and your opposing team got a referee under 30 minutes after the scheduled match time I will have to award your opponent with the win.""

So even though we have proof that they only had three people in the lobby (you can even hear them in the video saying they don't have anyone else online) and proof that we allowed more than 15 minutes for them to find another player

Needless to say, was closed with the same response. Both myself and the team leader then tried to contact live support, who was finally online. We ended up talking to the admin that closed both tickets in the first place, and he all but said explicitly that our proof didn't matter since the other team contacted a referee first.

If you're interested

Team leader's convo with admin: http://i.imgur.com/wp47O.png

We contacted the global admins of GB expressing our concern for the poor administration of the site, to which (as far as I know) the global admin made no response:

&gt; There are three people in a room. Person A

&gt; While person B is busy compiling the evidence for the police to show Person A is at fault

1272453036.0,bx71p,The Great Big List of MW2 Tips,onefingerattack,50,5,61,"Don't know if this has been attempted yet - but hey


## List of MW2 Tips

- Try not to use the mounted miniguns too much. If you've a group of enemies right across from you, then you're putting yourself at risk. The minigun basically puts a bullseye on your back. The entire enemy team will know where you are and consider you a quick and easy kill. 

- I'm not sure about the other sniper rifles

- If a claymore detonates

- Using Marathon and Lightweight will allow you to escape the blast of a claymore (in regular mode - not tested in HC)

- Claymores go hand in hand with the perk ""Scavenger"" if you're trying to hold down a position, as I've sometimes killed my team mates doing this.

- In HC mode, I immediately press Start to bring up my map and see where it's coming from. Cold blooded is also a VERY good perk in HC modes. Besides not showing up on UAVs, you're pretty much safe from enemy killstreaks. Also note that Stopping Power is useless on HC modes.

- In regular mode

- Those who quick scope efficiently died a WHOLE LOT while learning. Keep that in mind.

- On shotguns such as the Spas, I'd suggest using Marathon, as it'll give you that extra bit of flanking power.

- In Search and Destroy

- Use a sensitivity level that you're comfortable with. 

- Switching to the Tactical 10 button layout may allow you to pull off drop-shots

- A cooked frag grenade is awesome. If you're trying to clear a room

- Playing music through your microphone will get you muted. It will also prevent you from hearing footsteps and other important things.

- If you're using the Scrambler Pro perk just because it extends the time for claymores to detonate (by 3 seconds)

- In FFA, Pavelow. Once I get the Predator, I'm basically a shoe in for the rest. And once that Pavelow comes in, it will usually rip people to shreds and most likely win me the game. A silenced weapon in FFA is also a great advantage.

- If you feel as if you shot the other person first. Or if you feel as if your opponents bullets are bending around corners as you attempt to get behind cover, there are a large number of things that can cause latency.

- Thermal scopes in HC aren't as effective as you'll find that a lot of people are using Cold Blooded (in some instances

- Don't run around the map like Rambo unless you're good at running around the map like Rambo. If your KDR is horrible

- When you start a game

- On the PS3

- If there isn't a UAV up

- If you get an Ammo care package and you don't need it

- When placing a Sentry gun

- You should try out going prone while you're sniping. You'll have a great advantage over the other gung-ho snipers standing around like idiots.

- If you're using SP w/ no silencer, then don't fire. It's not worth it for 1 kill.

- Since you don't have Cold-Blooded, and your team, a lot of deaths.

- Always keep one eye on the radar. If you and all of your team-mates are looking in one direction

- At the start of the game, and getting 4-5 kills right at the start because I'm not caught in a stalemate at the other side of the map.

- If you're using Bling so you can get silencer/noob tube/whatever as well as red dot/holographic sight, or use Scavenger (the best perk imo).

- The Steady Aim perk is extremely hand with assault rifles. It gives you half a second to get a few bullets into your enemy while they're looking down the scope. I've had a LOT of kills using Steady Aim.

- Shoot and move. If you stay in one position for more than 3/4 kills (or more than a minute, you'll be knifed. So move, even if only a few feet, just to catch them off guard.

- The red dot on your radar which shows the location of an enemy is dimmer if the enemy is under something. That is

- FMJ does not make your bullets hurt more. It just decreases the amount of damage they lose going through surfaces.

I'll post more as it comes to me. Feel free to post your own or argue against any of my points. I'll add other people's tips to the list.

There were one or two points relating purely to aesthetics that I haven't included because I was initially looking for things that actually affect gameplay and therefore are useful for players to be aware of. While I have confirmation from r/MW2 for most of these
  
Nevertheless, if there is *still* anything you wish to add, please shout it out.

I got so pissed off that I made it my mission to take down all enemy air support. i.e. whenever an enemy harrier strike was called in, their harriers couldn't do shit. And if they managed to bring in a Chopper Gunner

Finally, I was fucking fuming. Not only had they spent the past 3 or 4 games noobtubing everyone; but they had the cheek to question why I was so persistent in taking down their air support. So I replied: ""If you noobtube, I am going to make it my mission to take down your air support."" I even told them that I had been killing myself just to switch to my Stinger class.

In the next game, who must have heard our mid-game conversation, decided to follow my lead and kill themselves, just to switch to anti-air classes whenever enemy air support was called in. They had an AC-130 up at one point, and I think it lasted about 5 seconds.

Second- I have a heart and some respect, promise.

Third- What do you think sniper rifles and LMGs are for? Engaging at a distance, or quite possibly so badass they need a handicap to give the rest of us mere mortals a chance. Your pick.

Fourth- It actually helps the team. It's the meta-game, my team will spawn on me consistently, and as long as I stay alive and safe, the spawn point stays alive and safe. 

To my team: If I'm not dying, you don't have to go running back from whatever epic mega-murder streak you're on to go defend the objective. I got this, homie. And as a bonus? If the other team is stupid enough? I rain Hell on their heads for you from the background with my killstreaks.

It also means that we have a place to discuss everything about about the series. See a cool Call of Duty 2 video? Want to discuss where the series is heading?

1285449205.0,div2m,Sniper rifle tips,onefingerattack,35,12,27,"Back in January, some of you will find these useful:

* **TAKE THE SHOT!**. This is the most important thing that I've learned. If you hesitate and try to be uber-careful, line up the shot and then... chicken out. Instead of actually focusing on taking the shot, their mind begins to wander and they start to worry about what might happen if they miss. Will my team mates make fun of me? Will I give away my position for nothing? Then... when the enemy player is just about to leave their line of sight, they panic, rush to take the shot and more often than not... miss. I have **rarely** seen a procrastinating sniper do well in MW2. What you **should** do is scope in, line it up as quickly as you can and then immediately take the shot. Throw caution to the wind and fire. Let it become a reaction instead of a decision. If you miss, no biggie. Just change up your position and catch out those hunting down the red dot on their radar. You **will** see results just by following this rule. 

* If you're quickscoping, then you're going to have to scope in first. Over time, you'll get better and quicker and achieve the same ""effect"" (i.e. the killcam/spectate effect).

* This isn't proven by any means

* When quickscoping, doing this will make it harder for you to get long-range kills. 3 is great with an Assault Rifle. However, when you need to take a dragshot with a sniper rifle, it is horribly lacking.

* A dragshot is when you scope in, just as the scope is passing over your enemy. Aim in as close to the person as possible and then drag the scope in their direction. Then, just as the scope is passing over their body, immediately take the shot. This is great for close encounters. It's also pretty good for long range shots.

* Don't attempt spawn snipes if the players on the other team have a faster connection than you. Usually

* It's best to stick to a specific area when you're using the sniper rifle. You don't have to camp. Instead, knifed by commando players, shot by akimbo shotguns and semtex'd. So, one day, I decided to play less aggressively and stick to the edges of the map. I got 30-0 on FFA that day and I haven't lost a FFA on Wasteland since. 

* Sleight of Hand is a **huge advantage**. Seriously. You NEED to be able to scope in quickly

* Stopping Power will lessen your chances of getting hitmarkers. If you're using the Intervention (or a bolt action sniper rifle on another COD game)

* Steady Aim ISN'T needed for quickscoping or sniping in general. Ninja works just as well. Steady Aim will only help with noscoping.

* If someone on the opposite team is a better sniper

* F2000 w/Red Dot is unaffected by EMP.  
  
* FAL iron sights are misaligned.
  
* FAL w/Holographic increases damage output.  

* FAL w/Red Dot is misaligned.  
  
* M9 w/Silencer offers no advantageous effects.  
    
* M16 w/Holographic lessens recoil and has tighter spread than any other attachment.  
  
* M93 Raffica w/any optics is misaligned.  
  
* M240 w/Silencer offers no advantageous effects.   
  
* MG4 iron sights are misaligned.
  
* MG4 w/Silencer offers no advantageous effects.  
  
* P90 w/Akimbo reloads faster.
  
* P90 w/Extended Mags gives extra 3 seconds sprint time.  
  
* Riot Shield attracts enemy Sentry Gun/Aircraft fire indefinitely
  
* SPAS-12 w/FMJ or Grip offers no advantageous effects.
  
* TAR-21 w/Red Dot is unaffected by EMP.  
  
* TAR-21 w/Red Dot and Heartbeat Sensor can be aimed with HBS still visible.

* Has attacked Harrier - Anyone who has attacked the helicopter gets threat
* Player Score - Highest scoring player in view gets most threat.

Whoever has the highest combined threat from these four factors will be the helicopter's Primary Target. The harrier will only target a player if it has seen more than 50% of his body.  Harriers will also track threat on other airborne targets

Private match, so if A's harrier is on the same plane, or lower, A's plane with be shot down by B's.  It is unconfirmed that a harrier will fire at an enemy plane that isn't lower or even with it.

EDIT 2 (thanks SmokyMcBongster): Here's the running list of the quotes:

**The first comment that started it all**:

&gt;His voice was smoother than the standard British accent, the voice is the opposite of itself, it is harsh and soft at the same time. I don't watch his videos for the info (though that is quite good) I watch them to hear that voice.

&gt; P.S. - I'm kidding

**Followed up by these:**

&gt;His voice, a cracked and dry paint that while not a smooth or free as when the paint first touched the canvas, now shows the subject with even more detail. His voice follows the same pattern, smooth and flowing, yet harsh and detailed.

&gt;ahem ""His voice, with the never ceasing ebb and flow of the ocean. As they are now worn smooth, they are flawlessly round, not a crack nor a mar defiles their pristine surface. That flawlessness is his voice.""

&gt;The most remarkable thing about his voice is the way it sticks with you, it is how it sticks with you, it is something that you can't shake, like the mist of a waterfall, it is all around you, heavy in the air. You feel it lingering everywhere. His voice does the same, it is something that you have not just witnessed,,True,t3_crvm1

1281486519.0,czq1v,A reasonable discussion on why the grenade launcher is bad for the game:,j1mb0,29,5,91,"If you're just gonna come here to bitch and complain or brag and troll

Personally, you can pinpoint something you did wrong, or at least could have done better, to either survive or get a kill. In short, you can learn a lesson, gain experience and knowledge, and become a better player for it.  

Being killed by a grenade launcher doesn't provide that option, only to have them just manage to pull the trigger once and also kill you?  

There is nothing to be learned from these situations

Beyond that, whether it be your primary, secondary, equipment, special grenades, attachments and perks in a conjunctive effort to best prepare yourself for any situation. You are supposed to have to think about what you want to do before you do it. Enter a building? better switch to your secondary if you're using a sniper as a primary. Going into open space? Put that shotgun away and take out an AR. Enemy got you pinned around a corner? Flash/stun them and make your escape or get the kill.  

Using the grenade launcher, completely eradicates any decision making. It's a simple, brainless, easy way to go through the game by abusing a clearly overpowered weapon. It removes any overarching strategy or thought process, gets rid of the need for aim or timing, and makes the game uncompetitive, and therefore

Any opinions on this? Or other opposing ideas?  

**TL;DR: The noob tube creates uncompetitive gameplay that causes a disconnect between a users actions and their ability to learn from their mistakes

**EDIT:** Meant to include... Obviously any reasonable person is going to understand that they're not always going to succeed in a game. They will die, being killed by a grenade launcher, you don't really get the feeling that the other person outplayed you, or did something better than you, just that they were abusing the system, and there's nothing you can do to counter it.  

And that really the only parameter that was dialed back to balance the grenade launcher was the fact that it only got two shots per spawn. And you can see how easily that was overridden.",,t5_2r3qb,True,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/MW2/comments/czq1v/a_reasonable_discussion_on_why_the_grenade/

Anyway, but nothing extremely special or ""wow""-worthy. Today, however, was much different. I decided to hop into a FFA match and try to find some boosters. I figured it would be pretty funny to get a pair of boosters with a claymore kill. Luckily enough, fate did not let me down. I landed in my FIRST pre-game FFA lobby, only to find 7 guys with the same clantag. ""The motherload"", as Sandy Ravage puts it. They were all candidly chatting away with one another about ""partners"" etc and where they'd all meet up. Without thinking, to which another retorted ""Yea but why did he change his clantag to ours?"" I then got messages asking me if I had a boosting partner. I didn't reply, it exploded, the next game arrived and I knew that they didn't trust me anymore... so I decided to put on the Cold Blooded Pro perk

Thinking things couldn't get better, with their backs to me, looking out the windows. I quickly planted the claymore. I was about to get a double kill when a third guy walked into the blast zone at the last second, giving me a triple kill. I then finished off the fourth guy with my silenced Spas.

By flag A, then stand on the ledge behind the fridge, facing the claymores. The fridge blocks almost all of your body from bullets and you're ready to pop anyone who gets by your claymores. You can also try to peek out over the ledges to kill enemies in windows on the other side of the map, and you'll be able to see a spawn area to your northwest (if facing looking out over the ledge).

Don't get me wrong - MW2 was a fun game but it felt so unbalanced IMO that I was more than happy to change.

A couple of reasons I changed to COD:BO include:

* COD:BO feels more like COD4
* Noob tubes and explosives in MW2 are shocking
* Poor perks and perk combos in MW2
* Unbalanced guns (UMP being one) in MW2
* No IW support
* Bad killstreak setups (a spin-off being boosters) in MW2
* Deathstreaks (I like the idea and perhaps it could be refined but perks with health support is a no-no)

MW2 took the game/series to another level so I hope MW3 can refine and combine the good parts from both MW2 and COD:BO.

While things like Commando and Danger Close still exist

* Last Stand is rarely used in MW2. Seriously, it sometimes **feels** as if 50% of the players are using Second Chance. I've been close to double kills and triple sprays, only to have one or two of them fall onto their asses and riddle me with bullets before I get the chance to reload. Frustrating as hell.

* The games that Infinity Ward make have a certain panache. The way the player moves, the graphics, the sound... I go onto Black Ops and it feels plastic, if that makes any sense. The footsteps still don't sound right. The guns feel like pea shooters. The ambient noise is annoying. The graphics aren't as appealing. The maps are... ""ok"" (Compare Terminal to any Black Ops map. Or Wasteland. Or Favela.)

* The RC Car is the most annoying killstreak. Ever. I don't know who thought it would be a good idea to introduce it as a 3 killstreak. 

* People don't have to aim their SMGs in Black Ops. They simply just equip Steady Aim and spray from the hip the entire time.

* The camping in this game is just amazing. It feels as if everyone and their dog wants to play defensively. What makes it worse is that they try to justify it in several different ways when its pretty clear that they're just worried about their KDR. It's got to the point that I actually considered recording the gameplay of some of the worst offenders and putting the footage up on Youtube. I watched one guys gameplay on Christmas Eve. He sat in the corner for the whole game. Whenever he died

* Then there's the lag, the shitty sniper rifles and shotguns, the lack of time delay on claymores and the godforsaken **PANIC KNIFING**!

I finished the challenge before I was able to prestige, you can actually get this done relatively quickly if you make a game out of hunting these devices down while still trying to contribute to the team or being in the top 3 of FFA.

So here was my class of choice.
Weapon: MPK5. Weapons don't matter as much as the FMJ

Secondary: Either a pistol or the AA-12. The shotgun allows you to just spray the claymore if you're trying to hit it quick with enemies around

Perks: Marathon, in my opinion. You need mobility to get across the map towards any flashing red objects as fast as possible. What makes the Sit Rep challenge to frustrating and challenging is that your ability to complete it is highly dependent on other players. They have to set the devices and live long enough for you to blow them up. Speed is very important, because I found that most players are not really thinking about living too long or camping like crazy. Most players like to set a trap in an odd part of the map and move on.

Semtex is the most accurate equipment that you can also throw long range

Game type: Sabotage or FFA were the most lucrative for me. They tend to feature a lot of claymore users and encourage a lot of camping. Sabotage restricts spawns to certain parts of the map, however, because as soon as you find a game with a claymore+scavenger guy, you've hit jackpot. 8 times out of ten this guy will plaster the map with claymores, letting you rack up huge numbers each map. I usually played an FFA map, and if I only got 2 or less claymores shot in the game, I'd move on to a new lobby until I hit pay dirt. Be picky here, you don't have to quit during the match if the lobby is cold, after you get used to Sit Rep Pro you can pinpoint enemy locations better than with a UAV. Even the players using Ninja couldn't hide from me after a while. I felt like Daredevil running around the map full speed, ""Omnicide""

So there's my story. For anyone thinking that they are up to the challenge, I'd love to here how you got it done. Sorry for text bomb, but after 10s of hours of grinding this out (plus my rangers being in the world series), I have a bit of excited typing syndrome.",,False,,True,t3_dve9u

I, especially if guys on the opposing team aren't smart enough to run away from each other once they hear my Predator. (Seriously this irks me by the way. If you hear ""Enemy Predator Incoming"" then get away from me.)

The main reason I don't use Sentry is because I don't want to wait for it to arrive, aim, boom, let's continue with business.

What I've noticed is the Sentry gun - if well placed and well guarded - can take out more, it has higher potential. But it's just too much of an investment. You have to get to a low traffic area. You have to wait for it. You have to risk it getting stolen. You have to nanny it or somebody's gonna knife it in 5 seconds. It takes 90 seconds instead of 10. That's easily 1/5 match duration if you seriously think about it. But play it right and you can get 4-5 enemies with it, plus you can take down some guys who are recklessly trying to flank it.

- Even if you do get your GT appended to your username, because of time differences and (more importantly) latency issues.

I figured that the best way to do this challenge (and any other finishing moves challenge) would be to do it in free for all, sentry guns and emergency airdrops throughout free for all games. At 29 kills of one game on Crash, I had at least a 10 point lead and about 2 minutes to do what I needed to do, so I ran to a nearby building and began throwing a few of the packages. I then just waited for people to flock over to either steal the packages or kill the people stealing the packages. When people started to arrive, I just began launching more markers. Some kid ran into the building I was in, and although I was tempted to kill him, but had to just turn around and run away. I jumped out of the building and got stunned, I received points and the game ended. I only wish that the killcam was from the point of view of the package so I could have seen how it happened because all we got to see was me running.

1298551925.0,frrmy,Everything I've learned about aggressive sniper play.,onefingerattack,29,9,20,"Unfortunately

* If you're going to quickscope, it seems as if the other player didn't even scope in fully. In reality, he/she was scoping in fully: It's just that game winning kills and killcams in general have less FPS (frames per second) than the game itself. In essence: A quickscope is when you scope in as quickly as you can before instantly taking the shot. Of course, doing this perfectly comes with practice.

* If you don't need to quickscope

* If you're looking for practice with the sniper rifle, you won't be tempted to switch to your machine pistol or shotgun.

* On the other hand: I've always felt that pistols make the best secondary weapons on a sniper class. If you miss your first shot or get a hitmarker, you'll probably already be dead.

* Try and stick to the outsides of the map with your back tilted towards the wall, running into the bunker on Wasteland during a FFA is going to be painful.

* Quickscoping in a private quickscoping match is different than quickscoping in a public game. Just be aware of that. There will be times when you'll be up against Commando knife-monkeys, regardless. 

* In FFA

* The reason a lot of snipers do that double tap thing is because they're trying to stay focused and ready. I've often felt at my best with the sniper rifle when I'm playing like I have ADHD and a ""Come at me bro! I'm ready!"" mentality. Obviously

* **You do not need** Steady Aim if you are quickscoping. Steady Aim will only increase your ability to no scope. I find Ninja Pro to be a much better counterpart as I like to sound whore and figure out where my enemies are coming from before I see them.

* FMJ is my favorite attachment for the sniper rifle for the obvious reasons. The Heartbeat monitor distracts me

* Just because you're quickscoping

* I usually use a higher sensitivity when I'm sniping. I use 3 for Assault Rifles/SMGs because it allows for accurate shooting over distance and I use 6 when rolling with a sniper rifle. The downside is that I'm less effective with my pistol when I'm on sensitivity 6.

* Stopping Power is a must when playing aggressively. One hitmarker = trouble when the enemy player has an automatic weapon.

* Do NOT move while quickscoping. For some reason, take the shot, start moving again... rinse and repeat. This will save you a lot of anguish.

* Sleight of Hand Pro is cool... but I feel as if it isn't necessary. It feels different when you're not using it

* The .50 Cal has a quicker raise time than the Intervention. The .50 Cal is a semi-automatic and is just as powerful. The Intervention is a bolt action

* Sniping in SnD is a whole different ball game. It's an unforgiving game type and the pressure of having others spectate often proves too much for people.

1286906183.0,dqadu,CUAVs are apparently awesome,babada,22,3,12,"As much as *I* have always found CUAVs called in by the enemy to be extremely frustrating I never really considered them useful in the killstreak progression. If my streaks are set to EDrops

These are my thoughts after only two nights of playing with them.

* The essential obvious: They block UAVs which is nifty. I find this to be *less* useful than typical because I like to play with /r/ (or those other guys I play with \*cough\*) and, I suspect that is closer to 19 of 20 matches.

* You can hide EDrops

* The CUAV hides friendly Predator Missiles, *I* should have been there. Since CUAVs come immediately before the Predators it is hard to cover your own Predators but the madman on your team will probably be getting the Pred around the same time you get your CUAV. The doubles and triples are much easier when they cannot see that red ring of death. The same is true for other air support; as a bonus, you also block the Harriers from showing up on the radar. The punk with a Stinger will waste a few seconds looking for the plane which gives you a few more seconds to stretch the most out of it. It also makes it more likely that someone will kill the AA before it fires.

* The CUAV hides your gunfire. This means you can walk into a room with 4 guys and kill them one by one and they won't even realize what is happening. You can clear out a spawn and watch people running away from the *very same building*. People have no idea that you are there. To make this cooler

* A single CUAV can instantly change the momentum of the game. It makes it harder for the enemy to coordinate and more likely to run into people running around without a specific purpose. It is especially frustrating for players such as myself who are radar dependent. They have no clue what is happening anywhere and the sudden advantage your entire team can quickly end whatever streaks they were working on.

Most of this is pretty obvious. I just suddenly found myself getting insanely lucky when the CUAV was up because no one knew I was in their base

So yeah. The CUAV is very much a team focused killstreak but it can be used to your advantage to help you get to the next streak on your list. It isn't the right option if you are going for the big stuff but I really enjoyed my CUAV/Sentry Gun/EDrop setup. CUAV/Sentry Gun/Pavelow would probably be a more kill focused streak option. If you don't like Sentry Guns I would suggest CUAV/Harrier/Pavelow. Getting another three kills with CUAV is likely but takes some luck. If your team loves UAVs than mixing in some CUAVs is brutal. Likewise if you have a few people running the classic 5/7/11 as the double Pred kills are much easier when they don't scatter.",,t5_2r3qb,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/MW2/comments/dqadu/cuavs_are_apparently_awesome/

1284159930.0,dcamh,Guide: Why lag happens OR It's Not All About Latency!,got_milk4,20,4,36,"Okay. So lately I've been reading and hearing a lot of people complain about lag

Well

First off

* **Router** - a device that is used to connect two or more networks together. This is NOT a switch
* **Switch** - a device that connects computers together. Not a router, read the definition above.
* **TCP/IP** - Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol. The international rules for data transmission over the internet.
* **Packets** - pieces of data that are encoded/decoded according to TCP/IP rules for transmission over the internet. Think of a packet as an envelope - on the outside it has sender/recipient information

Okay

When you want to transmit data over the internet, it is sent to your router, which, in turn, will pass it to your cable/DSL modem. The modem will transport the packet to your ISPs servers, who relay the packet through the appropriate servers until it reaches its destination. In most cases a packet will be passed through at least 10-15 servers until it reaches its destination.

Most applications use the TCP protocol for transmissions. This protocol is **connection-oriented**

* Hey
* Hello
* I would like to send you some data!
* Okay

And the data transfer begins. As packets are transmitted, after a predefined interval in the connection setup, the recipient will acknowledge the data letting the sender know that data is flowing just fine.

But what happens if there's a problem?

Well

* Sender sends packet 1--------------------&gt; Recipient
* Sender sends packet 2--------------------&gt; Recipient
* Sender sends packet 3--------------------&gt; Recipient
* Recipient says send me 4 -----------------&gt; Sender
* Sender sends packet 4--------------------&gt; Recipient
* Sender sends packet 5--------------------&gt; Recipient
* Sender sends packet 6--------------------&gt; Recipient
* Recipient says send me 7 -----------------&gt; Sender

Now

* Sender sends packet 7--------------------&gt; Recipient
* Sender sends packet 8------MALFORMED--&gt; Recipient
* Sender sends packet 9--------------------&gt; Recipient
* Recipient says send me 8 -----------------&gt; Sender
* Sender sends packet 8--------------------&gt; Recipient
* Recipient says send me 10 -----------------&gt; Sender
* Sender sends packet 11--------------------&gt; Recipient
* Sender sends packet 12--------------------&gt; Recipient
* Sender sends packet 13--------------------&gt; Recipient

See what happened there? The recipient noted a malformed packet was received, in which case the recipient requests the next set of data.

That's great! But it's not how Xbox Live and games in general work.

TCP is great for fixing errors and data transmission in general

Luckily for us gamers, unlike TCP, so instead of negotiating a connection, UDP simply sends the packets.

This is great for gamers. By disregarding error detection and acknowledgement, as you would very likely download files only to find they're corrupted.

This is a common source of lag! If packets are malformed or misrouted your Xbox will simply disregard them

And that's the end of my guide (unless I edit it of course!) If I've screwed up

Otherwise enjoy your new networking knowledge and go brag to some friends

**EDIT**: shagoth/WarriorThree made a couple of excellent points I'd like to outline here.

Firstly, and recommended for novice networkers, many routers (including almost the entire Cisco/Linksys brand) uses a buggy and possibly broken uPNP implementation. To test your NAT, the best way is to check MW2's Xbox Live screen where it will tell you your NAT status. If it's anything but Open (Moderate or Closed), you've got work to do. If you already have uPNP enabled and you're still getting a Moderate or Closed NAT, you may need to look into manual port forwarding. For each router the process is different but there's an [excellent website](http://www.portforward.com/) that will give you step by step instructions for almost every make and model of router, including most popular third-party firmware (DD-WRT

Secondly, the signals can interfere with each other and force clients to continually resend packets to the wireless router, and vice versa. If you're having troubles with wireless interference, you can use [this excellent free application](http://www.metageek.net/products/inssider) which will show you the wireless networks in your range and what channels they are on (NA players will be between channel 1-12, EU players will be between 1-14). Then configure your router to use the least crowded channel. If you're still having issues, you may consider switching to a ""simultaneous dual-band router"" which enables use of the 5GHz spectrum with Wireless N devices (you'll need an 802.11n adapter for your 360 in order to take advantage of the new spectrum). 5GHz has not been widely adapted by users as the technology is not found on many routers quite yet so in most areas you should not have many wireless networks to compete with, if any at all. You'll also avoid interference from your controller, microwave,False,

My brother, leaves, checks another area, checks his back, comes back and checks again, etc.  This really improves his playing, but it's not the checking his back that saves him.  It's not watching the enemies move up the street that saves him.

When the enemies round the corner and move down the street, but the second or third guy takes me out after they dodge behind the cover and have a fire fight.

* FFA should either be called ""Booster Hunter"" or it should be something more like a target game where one person is the ""target"" (maybe even whoever has the highest k/d or longest streak) and that person is worth double the points of the regular people. 

* On objective games like Dom or CTF, it's WAY too easy to get a nuke in DOM or CTF because all you really need to do is put thermal on a LMG and sit in a corner somewhere.

* Let *players* host games! That way cheaters can be kicked by the host

Anyone else got ideas?

TL;DR: MW2 multiplayer is broken. Here's some ways it could be fixed.

1274156860.0,c5f2w,The Y (or Triangle) double tap,hugobot,18,1,11,"Thought I'd share it here

A few popular uses double tapping Y (triangle) in MW2:

**Sniping**  
For those who are quickscoping/no scoping
** Reloads**  
If you get caught reloading a clip that isn't completely empty
**Search and Destroy**  
This one is probably my favorite reason for the Y double tap. When playing search, the most common setup is a class with cold blooded pro and ninja pro, so that you are completely invisible. A lot of people also use a sniper class for this because of the advantage of a ghillie suit. Then, what most people do, is find a nice spot to hide where they can keep their sight on the bomb and can't be spotted (such as the plants next to bomb site A in favela), and lay prone.  
When you lay prone, so that you take up less floor space.   
Ninja defusing is hilarious and satisfying

I can't think of other reasons for the Y double as of now

I just joined a Ground War Domination game in Overgrown. It puts me into the game that's in progress, then figured it must be some kind of hacked lobby, so I bailed out. I join another game, and after dying I notice that my title has been changed to ""owned."", and my emblem is that of the direct-impact grenade launcher. I go to change it back to the normal, and **OH HOLY GOD FUCK.**


All my emblems are gone


All my titles are gone, the country ones, and ""The Specialist"".


In ""Barracks"", my kills is ""15154"" and my deaths is ""-19193"".


All my unlocked weapon attachments have gone.


All my challenges have reset; both general and weapon-specific.


""Prestige"" has disappeared from the ""Challenges"" section.

The other team is talking trash and using everything they can to win: tubes, etc... and doing a good job of it.  We are down 2-3 and we go for a quick plant.  Bomb gets planted, but we all get killed and there are still ~20 seconds left to defuse.  I have at this point pretty much given up and am ready for the next match... however, the other team is rubbing it in: dancing/spinning around, teabagging, throwing stun grenades... you know the routine.  I really dislike that.  I always go for the disarm immediately so we can get to the next game.  

I suddenly realize that Lava is host... so as they finally start defusing, but after I back out, I get an invite from enoseht.  I join and lo and behold, the game is now tied 3-3 and I'm in time for the last round, along with Lava.  We end up winning the last round and the game to the other team's dismay... beautiful silence.  For some reason, it felt extremely satisfying.

I know hacking has always been an issue in MW2
  
Lately I've been pretty much sticking to Demolition and Domination. Tonight I decided to play a bit of S&amp;D and the first match I landed in had me spectating the last man. It seemed normal except that every kill he got triggered a message in big red text across the screen. For instance, made me laugh, lol. But then every match I tried to play afterwards was just hackers with aimbots. I've noticed that they seem to turn any game-mode into a Free-For-All -- or in any case, they make everyone (both teams) spawn at the same place so they can stand their with their invincibility killing everybody.  
  
Last night I found a hacker who was able to change the map during a match! While a match was loading with one map, but then he turned it off in time for me hit the floor and die.  
  
So I was trying all different kinds of game-modes but they're all full of hackers. I actually started having a decent Demolition match in Skidrow but then I notice how every enemy Care Package seemed to be a Chopper Gunner or AC-130. Then after previously getting 4 out of 4 clean headshots down the tunnel at the beginning of the match, lol. It's not so bad if you come across a fair hacked lobby, but they're extremely rare -- in fact I think it's probably accidental when they let you in. The mostly just show an on-screen message saying ""$5 access"" or something. The craziest one of these had a big pot leaf in the middle of the screen with text above it saying *YAY DRUGS!*, then the screen started rotating while the colours flashed between various negative image effects -- all the while it was raining AC-130 fire.
  
I know one thing that's worse than hackers though; *wannabe* hackers. Someone sent me a message saying
  
Anyway, I'm determined to go all the way, although I don't think I'll be purchasing any more *Call of Duty* titles until I have some sort of assurance that this shit won't be ignored in future. In fact, I don't think I'll be buying any PlayStation games at all until Sony sorts *their* shit out.",,False,,False,t3_f1c60

Personally, but every few games you'll find a kid who cracks his voice over ""camping"" or celebrating his rare victories with teabagging/magazine dumping/spinning/trash talking.  Instead of whining about it on /r/mw2, I started using claymores.

Playing [SnD Quarry](http://www.mw2blog.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/Modern-Warfare-2-Multiplayer-Map-Quarry.jpg) yesterday, jumping/spinning, and the screaming of ""F4GG0T"", and by every, I mean his only one.  

I was having a pretty good game, including the Little Shit.  I needed to clear out some before I could plant, but I had just over 1 minute on the clock.  I was already moving in on one by Back Road, so I got him from behind (sniping? really?) and used my UAV.  I had three other blips, one coming right at me from Offices' alleyway.  I met at the cargo container with a knife.  One more blip up by Garage, so I headed up Red Tanks and found him looking the wrong way on the rocks (sniping? again?).  After dropping him, the final blip (Little Shit) was far away enough that I ran down to plant at Offices

I planted, but his TAR beat my silenced M4.  

So Little Shit proceeds to do his biggest celebration yet, and eats it beautifully as he moves to defuse.  Game ends in favor of us, and we exited to the lobby where everyone shits on this jackass.  He ragequit in the middle of calling me a camping, cheating, motherfucking faggot.  I told him he couldn't even win a game with no other players.

Me and a friend/clanmate start out playing TDM and are both putting in work. I say ""Fuck it, AC130. I end up getting a 26 streak that game, so I ask him if he wants to try for a nuke in Dom. ""Sure."" He's a man of many words.

So we both set up some One Man Wonder kits (OMA with SP, Danger Close to put the game in Killstreak easy mode), and go into some Dom games. Took us maybe 2 games before we got a good lobby.

The match was on Estate, Nuke. My first Harrier doesn't do shit, and then of course gets shot down.

But then

We spawn locked them at C (lower farm house) and I had just switched to my Hardline kit to get my AC. I pop a squat in the bushes and start going to town... but wait, and trying to fend them off of me with the AC. They have about 180 pts then, so I'm hurrying. Of course they all spawn outside in a turn of luck, but my AC runs out of time right when I have like 21 kills (need 24 for nuke). I close the laptop, pull out my ACR, and turn around. They're all still spawning there. I'm maybe 20' away.

Fuck.

So, get another guy, and then run out of ammo. Shhhhiiiiiiiit. Switch to the same kit with OMA while backing up... and here he comes. The Marathon Lightweight Commando all star of their team. NOOOOOOOO.

Here's my guess at why people are reluctant. So far we've been playing a lot of pub matches and it's fun because we don't take it seriously.


Competitive play means taking the game seriously, I'm guessing there will be try-outs, cuts, an A and B team, and some people won't make the cut. Right now we have an all-inclusive group. We usually have around 6-9 people together on a good day.


Competitive play also means playing the game differently than what most of us are used to. Banning perks and weapons means a new meta-game. Without the RPG you need a new way of efficiently clearing out large groups of people in one room. Without claymores (which are countered by SitRep+FMJ or flash/stun grenades) one needs a new way of guarding one's flank. I'd rather leave the game as the developers made it


Also


But in the end I like that rush of adrenaline that comes with high stakes and intense gameplay. Search and Destroy comes to mind - I've had moments where I was the last one left

Lets take camping first, and especially in MW2, where running around the map like headless chicken will often get you killed, and fast. on top of that, EVERYBODY camps, [some people](http://www.reddit.com/r/MW2/comments/c2v5l/confessions_of_a_camper/) do a it a lot more often, and sit at the same spot, find a few nice spots on the map which I like, but if the tangos are coming in hot, and I'm kicking some ass

In CS and CS:S people really hated snipers, it's annoying being shot by a weapon that is one-shot one-kill, but **that's in the game**, deal with it.  In MW2 it's the tubes, most call them noobtubes, most actually use them from time to time, and they are quite effective in the right hands, and if you think that it's that easy to *noobtube* the map, or am I wrong?

Akimbo Magnums should be equipped when using last stand or Riot Shield.  Last stand with the magnums gives you a massive amount of firepower in the blink of an eye.  Handguns are the only weapons you can use while in Last Stand, you'll appreciate the fast switch times when your opponent hesitates or reloads.

Akimbo G18's are the best secondary in the game.  Some say it's cheating

Counter UAV is the best killstreak reward.  There's really no better way to frustrate the entire team than with counter UAV.

When throwing a care package, and so far it's worked.  If you find a nice secluded corner away from everyone, you're going to end up with an ammo, uav, or airstike.  I know they say it's random, but give it a try.

Ammo care package and tactical insertion make great traps.  This goes along with using the care package around enemy troops.  If it turns out to be a dud (ammo, or destroying the TI.  They'll usually hesitate long enough for an easy kill. 

Scavenger and Slight of Hand are your two most powerful 1st perks.

The other Nuke was in Invasion and was a *lot* more scrappy. Almost ran out of P90 ammo at one point and managed to kill one last guy and take his TAR-21. I had already used my Harrier and CG but I had no idea what my streak was up to so every kill was super tense

* The knife should be added as a secondary weapon. This means that a player will have to equip the knife before being able to use it. In COD BO campaign

* All crutches should be taken out of the game. Painkiller, Martyrdom, Last Chance etc. People should not be awarded or saved because they were shot-up. They should learn not to die. End of story.

* Killstreaks should not count towards other killstreaks.

* Get rid of the ""dogs"" killstreak. If a player camps and earns himself the dogs, the game is effectively over in most cases because you can't take out your missile and take them down. You can only wait until they finish tearing the other enemy players to pieces. Basically, all killstreak awards should be destructible (i.e. leading to the end of the killstreak).

* Equipment choices should be winded down. It's getting ridiculous at the moment. You have claymores, even if it's just a second.

* Overpowered shotgun primaries or underpowered shotgun secondaries.

* Less places to hide. Provide cover etc. Provide the odd room here and there

* No handicaps on sniper rifles

* Killstreaks can only ""kill"" at 5+. No more RC Car bullshit.

All in all; the game should favor fast-paced/fun/flowing gameplay.

1285969267.0,dlolt,S&amp;D Tips,NOLAsigma,12,1,12,"These are some tips for anyone just starting to play S&amp;D.

I'll start off with two basic things I have found to be very helpful when playing S&amp;D:

- A player is able to switch classes, (may be longer, not sure). If you are a player who, like me, seldom uses cold blooded on their usual S&amp;D class then make the most of this grace period and switch to a cold blooded class when opposing players call in kill streaks too soon. I find this to be highly beneficial and usually do it at least once a game. That said, you should still pay attention to the scoreboard at the end of each round to see if anyone may have obtained any kill streaks, enabling you to switch classes preemptively.

- The second general tip is that when crouched or ADS

As for the best perks to use, it gives you the ability to show up in places quicker than the opposing players will expect you to be there, giving you the drop on them.

For the red perk I find hardline to be great

As for the green perk, and with only one life, you don't want to put yourself at any preventable disadvantage. Sit-rep is really the only other one you may want to consider as there are a lot of explosives used. I only use sit-rep if playing with a team in order to call out spots of claymores and C4 to whomever is rushing.

I won't really say anything about what guns to use, although they are helpful. If not using one, realize that opposing players may flock to your location when you fire, use this to your advantage. Get a kill, run a decent bit away (thanks to marathon), look back and see if you can pick off some greedy bastard. Also use your fire as misdirection.  In a clutch situation, run to one bomb site, then take off to the other site

As for equipment, enabling you to pick up kills even after you have died, thus helping the team.

Most players here really seem to be hung up on Domination and TDM, the necessity to plant or defuse the bomb within the 2:30 time rounds really helps cut this down. I have also noticed that there tends to be less use of the noob-tube as the repeated firing gives away your position. All things considered it is a great game, good for playing with a friend switching off each round, as well as having great drinking game potential.

Feel free to add anything you have found to help you in your S&amp;D experience.  

Edit: I forgot to mention the infamous ninja defuse. Sometimes opposing players will hide near the bomb site utilizing the switch weapon double tap until you plant the bomb. As soon as the bomb is planted most players run away to a hiding spot

I find this ridiculous but it doesn't really bug me. But now I am beginning to wonder what

First and foremost: I do not think camping is cheating because it isn't. But I also do not consider it cheap. After giving [Sirlin's Playing to Win](http://www.sirlin.net/ptw) a read through I realized that camping is plenty of awful things but it is *not* cheap.

Secondly

Those points out of the way

* I know you are there
* You don't know I am here
* If I wait five seconds I get a low-risk kill

This isn't camping.

Adding more specifics to the camping label doesn't help too much. If camping is ""staying in the same spot for half a minute"" there isn't much you can do to know that someone is a camper. You get to see the killcam. If

I play mostly pickup games in Mercenary TDM. People there have no concept of teamwork. You will get completely abandoned by your team and end up in enemy territory surrounded by spawn after spawn.

* I know you are there
* You don't know I am here
* I am not going to run out of cover; I am going to kill you

After you realize I am there

* Find the best cover I can
* Wait for a chance to get the hell out of there
* Kill anyone who comes looking for me

I am not a camper because I get stuck in a room by myself and happen to outdraw five people in a row.

Likewise

* I know where you will be
* You don't know where I am because I moved
* I get a low-risk kill

All of this being said, being cautious, or being attentive. UAV, Heartbeat Sensors and SitRep Pro make it pretty easy to notice someone running down a hallway all by themselves.

But standing in the same spot for the entire match looking at the same tunnel from the same window is camping. Running all the way across the map to get to your spot and then waiting is camping. (Unless you are using a sniper rifle. Then it is sniping.)

The reason I am bringing this up is because the gut reaction ""CAMPER!"" will hurt your game. There may be a significantly more relevant reason you just died. Instead of turning off your brain and turning on the rage *learn* as much as you can about the situation.

In event that someone *is* camping

The best players do this without having ever played against you. They can predict your movement based on the hundreds of games they have under their belt because

When people blame me for camping I smile. It means that I am so much better than they are that my movements are magic to them and they cannot perceive the deeper strategy involved. And

He even took to trying to use the RPG when going into one on ones against me. In Quarry, they started talking about me and ""my aimbot"" in the lobby

1267496509.0,b810p,Advice from my COD4 days.,BibleBeltAtheist,12,2,16,"The first shooter that I played, but rarely ran into any real competition. My head continued to inflate as I destroyed just about everyone I went up against. To this day I haven't played any PC shooters and apparently this is where the competition was to be had. That was until I picked up COD4

I beat the solo campaign on the hardest difficulty in order to get the hang of it

For the longest time this trend of ass kickery continued. I made lots of friends, so I tried camping. I tried run and gun. I tried claymores, c4, 203, TDM, Domination, S&amp;D and everything else that I could think of. I was getting beat up like a redheaded step child

Then one night I was playing FFA with a long time XBL friend named dcCharlie. Charlie was an old school gamer. My first system was the NES. Charlie first started playing on the Atari 2600. He had the voice of a late night Jazz radio host. You know the voice

Anyhow, *Shoot fasta, nigga*

Shoot fasta, but reaction speed is a skill that can be practiced and improved upon over time. So that's what I did. I analyzed my game play and learned how to shoot fast which, of course, allows me to take targets down faster than they can take me down. Considering we meet up at high noon, hands on holstered six shooters. 

So

Learn to strafe around active corners while already aiming down your sights. As I'm sure you know, you are more likely to get an accurate shot off. An example of this is near the C flag on terminal. If you are coming from the lobby, there is a good chance people will be camping around Burger town. If you're coming from the metal detectors, there is a good chance that the enemy will be camping at the top of the escalator. 

If you are the second person to make it to the engagement, don't forget to throw those flash bangs and stun grenades! 

Next, then you will cut the time it takes your bullets to reach them by as much as you possible can. (Considering you are accurate)

Make sure your gun is always between chest and head range when running around. If your gun is too far to the left, or down, it will take that much longer to get a lock on your target.

Slight of Hand Pro offers you the ability to ADS (aim down sights) quicker. So

Remember Reaction Time is more skill than an inherent ability. With enough practice there won't be anyone you can't kill. 

TL;DR

**Pro Tip: ""Shoot fasta nigga!""**

It has also been given some new features.,onefingerattack,17,8,10,"In relation to the [notice post](http://www.reddit.com/r/MW2/comments/hyk1j/rmw2_notice_gamertagsfinding_other_redditors_to/) that was posted a few days ago

**Search Features**

When it was first launched, a bug in the advanced search feature had reared its ugly head and forced me to take the entire thing down. Basically, the search feature was showing duplicate results. Fortunately, I managed to pinpoint the problem and fix it. This means that you can now search by:

- Platform
- Timezone
- Microphone
- Preferred Games (MW2
- Preferred Game Modes (TDM

i.e. you can now narrow down results and find Redditors that compliment your own Call of Duty gaming habits.

**Hosting**

When the site was first launched, I was forced to rewrite certain pieces of code/database queries; just because the free host in question had crappy default settings that brought the site down. Thankfully, a fellow Redditor (Reddit user [jargoone](http://www.reddit.com/user/jargoone)) was more than willing to give us free space on his hosting plan. He also registered a domain name (http://redditgaming.net) for the site. This was all done out of his own pocket, so may he bask in a million upvotes!

**Profiles**

Everyone that has submitted their details now has a ""profile"" of sorts. This profile details all of the information that you have submitted to us. In the future, Steam etc

**Login**

You can now login (using the password you registered with) and update your preferences and details. Sick of Domination? Well now

**CSS**

The app can now be used to generate CSS for Call of Duty subreddits. The feature is available to anyone who is logged in. This means that COD subreddits can now generate the CSS that shows gamertags beside Reddit usernames. I might also add in a feature that chooses people at random

It is hoped that this system can act as the hub for all Call of Duty subreddits. Also - If you have any bug reports or recommendations etc,False,,t5_2r3qb,False,,,t3_i35rx

1304000340.0,gzbfv,The definitive answer: Why the M16+Holo is superior to the FAMAS.,limitz,12,4,26,"There is a lot of misconceptions and straight up untruths, all burst guns have the same burst speed

However

1. SoH Pro
2. SP Pro
3. Ninja Pro

SoH halves reload time, as well as noticeably faster reload time. Most importantly though, the M16 + Holo has less recoil than the FAMAS + RDS and a much tighter bullet spread. This leads to better accuracy. Just compare the recoil patterns:

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DSvlq_sEf0

It's true that the FAMAS has better range

The FAMAS has ONLY a 10 meter advantage over the M16, especially the two extremes (CQC/medium-short, and long range), the M16 + Holo is a better choice than the FAMAS due to the reasons I gave above. 

Also another thing to consider, the next to no bullet spread of the M16 really helps it out and almost negates the damage advantage of the FAMAS as it will be a one burst kill anyways.

Just for the record, so I've used both guns A LOT. Matter of fact, I got the gold title for the FAMAS before the M16. I wouldn't give up the much tighter bullet spread of the M16 Holo for a slight damage advantage IF AND ONLY IF the enemy is between a 10 meter window (47 to 57 meters). It's just not worth it. 

To summarize:
Between 0-47 meters: M16 + Holo &gt; FAMAS
Between 47-57 meters: FAMAS &gt; M16 + Holo
57 meters and further: M16 + Holo &gt; FAMAS

In 80%+ of the situations

Just my 2 cents.",,t5_2r3qb,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/MW2/comments/gzbfv/the_definitive_answer_why_the_m16holo_is_superior/

Later that evening, just for shits and giggles. These guys were dumbfounded that we were calling them hardscopers, which made it hilarious.

1287011509.0,dqwcv,So which silenced guns (assault and sub) are best for running without SP and not losing to much punch?,satisfiedsardine,10,3,34,"Could anyone recommend both a sub machine gun and an assault rifle that still has some decent power despite being silenced and run without stopping power?

EDIT: Wow

To give you more background I am ultimately looking for a silenced gun to run with Cold Bloodied Pro. I love the ACR silenced

I think what I will do is try running with these two guns:

Tar-21 Silenced
| Slight of Hand Pro
|Cold  Bloodied Pro
|Ninja Pro

UMP
|Scavenger Pro
|Cold  Bloodied Pro
|Ninja Pro

I will use the UMP on near on all maps and use the Tar for the bigger maps such as wasteland and Afghan.",,t5_2r3qb,True,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/MW2/comments/dqwcv/so_which_silenced_guns_assault_and_sub_are_best/
