Perfect

So, it seems empty at first, but after a few minutes a SUV shows up, moving onward towards the barracks, passing the ATC. 

We sneak up in the east treeline, the same SUV.

I move closer, one being bandit, two gillies, parked next to the barracks, and seemingly lootcycling it (putting stuff into a tent just outside of it).

I quickly decide to let her crouch towards them, ""Hey guys, im friendly, please dont shoot me"". I could tell by the reaction that this was the first time they encountered this, and so they began a friendly conversation and like most of would do, they hit on her, and she flirts back.

At this point i move towards the tinshack (next to chopperspawn) and i tell her to tell them, missing a wheel - maybe one of them could help her out?

As they move closer i've already assumed position next to the door, while the bandit is still waiting outside as driver in the SUV. She quickly turns around, closing the door, while i take them both out with 3-4 m10 bodyshots.

I hear the SUV engine turn off, i get shot to the head almost instantly by a FN-Fal, and after some shootout, she manages to get him down.

So if you saw one of rockets comments recently he said he would be interested in doing an AMA on here if one of the mods contacted Matt Lightfoot on the forums. I've gone ahead and started the paperwork and we / I have come up with two ideas of how we can do this.

- Rocket does it ""live"" and replies to questions as they are asked... IE - how it is done in r/iama

- We submit questions here and upvote the best questions you think should be asked. We take the best 10-20 upvoted questions from this thread and get rocket to post a response here with his answers

So lets get some potential questions going and feedback into what kind of Iama you guys are looking for and I will try and get that rolling. However it is the weekend and he is a busy guy so this might take a while.

Okay

First thing is you want to make sure your GPU drivers are up to date. Go to [nVidia's drivers site](http://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx?lang=en-us) and find your card and update that shit. No matter how recently you did it

Second, and then nVidia Control Panel. This is going to let you configure your card **IF** you have the latest drivers installed. I'm not even joking about the drivers thing, update that shit to whatever the site says you should have.

Once you have NVIDIA Control Panel open

Now

Click the drop-down menu and you should be presented with this big fuckin' list of programs that nVidia recognizes. If ArmA 2: Operation Arrowhead is in there

To add ArmA 2: Operation Arrowhead, so mine is in C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\arma 2 operation arrowhead. Select ""ArmA2OA.exe"" and then click ""Open."" BAM. You just added ArmA2OA to the list of programs that nVidia recognizes. Grats, you're a fucking technological wizard.

Scroll down until you see ""Threaded optimization"" and TURN THAT SHIT OFF. It should be set to ""Auto"" by default

There. You're done, you best save that shit.

Fire up DayZ and go ahead and look at some dead soldiers to your heart's desire (you sick fuck).

**EDIT:** Hey, go ahead and look into turning it off and see if it fixes the problem. If it does, **spread the word about that shit**.

**EDIT2:** Fuckin' S128K DELIVERS with a *possible* ATI fix. I don't have an ATI card so I can't test it

(Updated due to Bandit Rage of feeling punished for not getting a reward. Just to proof a point

- This introduces a ~~reward system~~ Smiley Flower for being a nice guy and to discourage any form of killing.

- To gain one **Survivor Rescued** you must apply **Blood Transfuse+ Bandage + Morphine/Painkiller** to a player

- To gain one **Survivor Revived** you must apply **Epi-Pen +Blood Transfuse + Bandage + Morphine/Painkiller** to a player

- These stats should not be saved

**Screen2(c) Bandit Death:**
http://i.imgur.com/Bs0zM.jpg

- If you **die as a Bandit**


I believe this would drastically change the whole gameplay of DayZ. Even though it is a sandbox game where players are allowed to do as they wish, players will have to be more cooperative to fight against them..


.


**TLDR:**

***UPDATE 1: 19 minutes after posting

***UPDATE 2: Good detail of the background of why it happened at this post:*** 
http://www.reddit.com/r/dayz/comments/157qzu/dayz_hive_is_down_i_need_your_help/c7k0p3u

The central HIVE server for the mod was originally provided donated by one of the early hosting companies

Recently this hosting company changed hands, and then seven hours ago the hosting account was cancelled. This account holds the HIVE central database needed for authentication of the mod.

So far, and myself have tried desperately to try and get some resolution.  I have offered the company to pay the account myself, I have threatened to name and shame, I have done everything I could to get the server back online but all they will do is email the technical contact they have (the email no longer exists) and they will not take my money to bring it back online.

What I asked for was for the hosting company to turn the server back on while all this drama is sorted out, and was told ""the listed owner might not have been paying for some important reason, and we would be breaching his security by reactivating it while this was sorted out"". As only the non-existent email is listed as a technical contact, they would not accept my money to reactivate it.

We have two options

1. Setup a new server (we're doing this now).
2. Get the old server turned back on and sort out the issue (we're still trying to do this too).

I'm hopeful that we will get the old server up and running. It would help to see a show of force from the community

***EDITED: contact details removed

I spoke to Chad at support

It would be awesome if people could politely get in touch with Phonenix NAP and ask them, because I am sure if enough people help out they'll agree to put the server online until we can try and locate the previous hosting owner who was the technical contact.

I'll post more information as I can,False,self,t5_2ty3s,1356074340.0,,dev,t3_157qzu

Edit: Update Rant Incoming

The level of douchebaggery in this game is unparallelled. I have played for a total of 59 hours thus far and I have encountered ONE friendly survivor. His name was Amon and I gave him a gun

I could understand being killed by other players in order for them to upgrade their arsenal with my gear

I have tried to be a nice player since i began playing this game

Each time I was backstabbed, he popped around the corner and shot me in the face without a second thought. 

This didn't anger me, today was the first time I ever logged on someone. Someone I wasn't even actively engaged with in combat either. Am I ashamed? A tad, but at the time I was just so amazed that someone could be such a dick that I didn't care anymore.

I was running from a town with a horde of zombies behind me. I had planned to lose them in the forest when I saw another survivor pop out of the woods i was heading towards. Not wanting to take any chances, compass, knife, matches, axe). Clearly this guy was geared and was gaining nothing by killing me. I wasn't a threat to him whatsoever yet he felt the need to attempt to kill me. 

After one of his shots connected, and yet here he is shooting at me from a few hundred yards away for shits and giggles.""

At that point I had sincerely hoped that he did not have matches, a compass, and the other tools I had because he damn sure wasn't going to get them off of me. I ESC'd out and aborted out of there, server hopped, bandaged myself up and went on my way. I even ran into a newly spawned player and gave him some food and an axe to get him started and continued my search for a vehicle (I have yet to find one in 59 hours of playing). 

So there you have it

Anyway

TL;DR - I caved and ALT-F4'd on a guy. I was butthurt, I still have my stuff, I already have all your upvotes, etc etc",,False,self,1342537459.0,t3_wn05x

First, then I know myself and my whole group will all be moving up north. For now though, we've sunk hundreds of hours building bases and repairing vehicles that are just reset or deleted upon server restarts. We play the Elektro-pvp minigame because it's fun, but also because it doesn't frustrate to the level that the rest of the game does at the moment. It's not like counterstrike or modern warfare in that we don't get free guns, we start at a huge disadvantage in the city and must work our way up the pvp ladder. It's a very fun pvp game that's completely unique to any other FPS and I think it's overlooked by a lot of people.

As for the ""unarmed survivor, but generally it's because those people are in a very bad spot. If you're going to try to loot bodies on sniper hill, you're probably going to get shot at. There is literally 1 city in the game that 90% of PvP bandits use and it's Elektro. If you're looking to survive, use one of the many, many other cities.

I wish the people who want to just survive and build bases the best of luck, you better believe I will be RPing it up as a base-building, vehicle repairing, zombie slaying son-of-a-bitch, but for now, I'll be countersniping Sniper Hill.",,self,,

Being a total noob, I went in and long story short got murdered by like 30 zombies. I dropped all of my equipment right before I died and told some guys I had met from this sub in vent the coord location.  Unfortunately they all got wiped in a firefight minutes before, so maybe some lucky guy was able to find my eq.

I finally linked up with these guys and had a fucking hilarious time in Cherno lighting up the whole city with flares and looting like mad men, and I can't wait to leave work and be terrified to log in again.

1343154681.0,x33e0,So I declared war on them.,vertigo1083,804,182,208,"Last night, and to my shock

The next thing I know, and this screaming man tumbled from it.

He was holding an AS50.  I hadnt really taken a good look up until that point.  

It was goddamn pandemonium.  

Elektro was literally burning.  The north firehouse was a leveled piece of rubble.  The sky contained no less than 3 choppers

I barely had registered all of this when shots pinged off the side of the fallen chopper.  A little voice inside my head said: *You know what to do*.

So I declared war on them.  

My little friend with the AS50 was also sporting satchel charges (hacked, determined the source of the guy firing at me, and shot him directly in the face from 600m.  (Wow, I fucking love this gun!).  Then, I incurred the wrath of the chopper and its mini-gun.  Seems my late friend relayed my position to his friends in the sky.  

I scrambled into the schoolhouse, then.  

I crawled out to them

Oh

So I place the charges onto 2/3 choppers and was about to google how to detonate them when my friends in the nearest flying chopper discovered my position.  Back into the schoolhouse I run.  I made it all the way onto the roof when it dawned on me.  Could I...?

I lined up the shot to the helicopter, I'm pretty sure.  He definitely heard it because he swung the chopper *facing right into my line of sight*.  The 2nd shot did not miss, I'm guessing, as ""Havok had died"" and the chopper spun out of control and crashed.  The other player inside dies.   Inbound comes the next chopper.

I could not seem to line up a good shot on the pilot.  Either i was losing my nerve

I let loose both clips into the chopper.  Around 15 bullets or so, I had taken down 2 choppers and a sniper, total, 5 bodies.  Jesus.  I could only wish that it was more legit.  The hacking seems to take away from the accomplishment a lot.  Oh well.  I dislike hackers on public servers, fuck em.

Feeling pleased with myself

[Oh, I would have put them on before pressing the button.

I'm not sure what was more satisfying.  Watching *all 3* helicopters explode, and what followed.

""Fuck you

I dunno what the hell type of plane it was, that at least explains the leveled buildings.  I considered Alt+F4ing out, just to be spiteful and keep the AS50; but fuck it.  I didnt earn it anyway.  

It was much more satisfying that they had to level a city to finally kill me.

I don't always get blown to all hell and booted off a server

It's because I ruined a hacker's day.

#TLDR:

Go fuck yourself

So we found this one unarmed guy and we yelled at him to ""GET IN THE FUCKING BUS"" he said ""Can we pick up my friend?"" I said ""SURE! :D"" 

At this point my friends are saying ""LOL HE'S OUR SLAVE

And I'm saying ""Don't be a fucking dick

We pick up the other guy, you'll see Elektro Fire Station, now if you get out, we can take a tour of it"" etc etc.

We even made it to Cherno Church and had a sermon. I told everyone on skype ""Okay, then got back on the bus. (that was probably my favorite part)

We bring them to a grocery store and get them Czech backpacks to which they ask ""What are these for?"" 

...

They were NEW to the game.

Didn't even know what a backpack was...

They even said ""It's been two days and we haven't seen a single weapon yet...""

Apparently they have been spawning and getting to a town and people murder them before they could do anything!

So we finally tell them about the backpacks and how to use them

They jump on the stream and watch it (hearing our skype call and my friends saying how they want to kill them because they don't trust them)

The new guys chime in and say ""Dude

We get to Berezino and get to the military tents.

They find their first guns!

A M16A2 for one guy

They both shoot some zombies

It literally made me feel like a good person.

They said ""Where is a good place to log out?""

We let them know, and I couldn't help but think...

""How many other NEW survivors are there out there

That moment forever changed the way I play DayZ.

1371111735.0,1g99dn,Complainers: Do you actually know what a game engine is?,jimmysaint13,755,221,333,"After reading through much of the comment sections on what's been shown at E3 so far

Do you *actually* know what a game engine is? What it does? Probably most importantly

A Game Engine is basically everything that ISN'T art assets. Models

Game Engine parts can be split into two distinct groups

**Visual**

* Rendering engine (how the game actually draws pixels on the screen)
* Physics and Collision Detection
* Sound (NOT the sounds themselves
* Animation (NOT the animations themselves

**Logical**

* Scripting
* AI
* Networking (netcode)
* Streaming (data flow
* Memory management
* Threading (putting the game processes in task threads a processor can work with)

Now, and hasn't been completely re-written yet. They HAVE replaced almost every piece of the engine since 2004, but they have done so incrementally across their releases. Look at the difference between Half Life 2 and Episode 2. Look at the difference between Counter Strike: Source and Global Offensive. Big, noticeable differences there, but they're all running Source.

Why do I bring this up? To show you that there are a LOT more pieces to a Game Engine than you probably realize. Most of the pieces in the Logical category you don't really even notice all that much unless there is a SERIOUS problem. 

I can pretty much *guarantee* you the majority of the time spent developing the SA thus far has been on the netcode. There was literally NOTHING they could salvage from the old netcode as it is a 100% completely different model. ARMA 2's netcode works as sort of a peer-to-peer system where all players were sharing data directly with each other

There have been improvements in other areas as well

We see that the game handles itself MUCH smoother, and threading departments. The game now runs much more efficiently. People have been complaining that what we've seen looks laggy, but that's because at E3 they are running the server and game on the same box. You would NEVER have been able to do that with DayZ Mod.

I wrote this up because I *really* feel like the majority of people complaining have no idea what a Game Engine is,,False,self,t5_2ty3s,False,,True

I froze, and felt suddenly completely exposed. I stared at the shifting grasses, the nearby barracks, seeing nothing, having heard only that vaguely British accent somewhere to my left. Bricks were indeed shat. Frozen for a long instant, I figured I had nothing to lose.

""..Friendly!""

""Right. I'm not going to shoot you

Another look at my screen

""Hell no. I can't even see you

A figure melted up from the grass barely ten feet away, and he crept closer, cocky grin on his voice.

""Good to hear. Wanna go loot that barracks?""

""I am -so- down for this. I was expecting to get my head blown off. Again.""

Laughter from my ghostly

""You're the first one I didn't. Normally I kill everybody. Let's go.""

...

Things were going remarkably well. I'd been gifted some nice camouflage, planning our next move.

From behind me

""Go, high powered shots rang out as we broke cover, from the tallest tower of the airport. Ricochets pinged off the runway as we sprinted for cover, howling at our heels and hot bullets trying for our heads driving us at a dead run. We dove for cover behind the tall steel of the hangers, turned and pistoled down our undead pursuers.

Immediately we were on the hunt, as I trailed behind the ghilli-suited sniper, following his lead completely. We were probably going to die, but for once, I wasn't going to die alone.

We darted, the most likely spot our unfriendly shooter had fired from. If I closed the gap on him, I'd put 7 1911 rounds into his head for his troubles.

Into the building, out the window, to the tower's peak...

...Nothing. Barren. Our shooter had vanished without a trace. We laid on the hot roofing, for some sign.

Crawling along the front of the hangers, sight in, and unleash a vengeful volley upon him. Blood sprayed from his chest, a scream rang out, and he disappeared between two hangers. His rifle discharged in his panic, and we stared grimly from atop the roost as the zeds turned, and shambled madly into the gap.

The screaming went on longer than we both expected.

...

Things had gone, murderous friend's squadron had arrived. For an hour, we dominated the airfield. The barracks were picked clean, and we were riding high on volumes of loot and quite ready to crack open a few tins of sardines.

Then a volley ripped apart the ATC tower. Two men went down in there, as a silenced bullet ripped through my newest friend's leg, and he toppled into the grass.

Dust from the explosion covering me, I didn't speak, only listened to the radio as my newfound compatriots panicked, cursed, and scattered in different directions.

Gunfire again, answered from the far end once again. We'd gotten in the middle of two other squads, been picked apart, and now they were fighting over the scraps.

Silence, maddening panic every time a shot rang out. It seemed to last for hours.

I must have passed out from exertion, as calm as it ever was. Cautiously, in a dead whisper, I tried the radio.

""Anyone alive out there?""

A long pause.

""Still alive... bleeding bad. Can't walk. Can you find me?""

Same voice that challenged me barely a few hours ago

""Hell yes

Out of the barracks, around the gate. He could barely see. Spinning, trying to orient myself, to make sense of where he said he was...

Teeth. Teeth and clawing hands and guttural roars that never stopped. I snarled in response, gore erupted from the howling runners as I put them down. The shotgun's roar too soon made that hollow, stomach-sinking 'click', and my pistol was in my hand, just as teeth snapped into my ankle. I screamed, hearing my bones crunch more than I felt them, and put two rounds through the crawler's left ear.

Panic and adrenaline coupled with quickly mounting agony, I jammed it into my leg without a moment's pause. I should have been screaming, down and useless, except for one thing.

""I can see you

I stood, I limped along the fence, leaning on it more than walking on my own.

Around the corner, and he had his boot knife out and readied, despite the blood covering his face, and eyes.

I collapsed next to him, despite blood-caked face, the dozens of bites, and a fractured arm. Still binding the worst bite on his leg, I gasped softly.

""Hell's so funny

He wiped his chin

Twenty feet away, lay a dirt bike.

""S'our lucky day

THEN

Ok lets get a little back story out for those of you who have not been around dayz for very long. In-case you did not know dayz became popular due to the fact it was the first zombie survival game that did things well the way dayz does it, gear, location, etc. That was due to the central Hive database that Every server connected to. This unified server system made people love DayZ even more. For those of you who are wondering the time frame I am talking about, I am referring to the very early stages of dayz, right around the end of april and mid may.

At the time what made dayz so amazing was the thrill of trying to survive with just what you find, And from what I can tell what Dean (Rocket) truly wants with DayZ.


NOW

Now the whole Idea of dayz has changed, is how it has always been. The central Hive is pretty much none existent, logging into pretty much every server will cause you to spawn with a new character and new gear. So right there a huge part of what dayz used to be is changed now.

I know this is going to get me a lot of hate

And now onto what is the worst thing to happen for dayz ""Private Hives"". Private Hives have ruined pretty much everything that made DayZ, and they now have the ability to spawn vehicles where ever they damn well please which is for sure not what dayz was about.

Now onto admins giving weapons, heal, and do what ever to players is also something that ruined what dayz was all about. You used to have to spend hours upon hours trying to find loot in military barracks and heli crashes (even though they used to almost never work) just to find say a DMR, If you had a squad with a DMR, a winchester, and an M4/M16 or two you were king You had Fun in your group as you knew that the 5 hours you just spent finding that DMR was worth it. Now that is all gone, server admins can simply give them selves guns weapons what ever, ""donate for an as50"" or ""donate for a loadout of your choice"" that sounds an awful lot like pay to win which is something no one expected dayz to ever be. Now granted you will say well not all servers do it. Well your right but a decent amount do

And onto my last point.

NEW PLAYERS

Right now is the worst time for players to pickup dayz for the first time as not only do they have to get used to the clunky inventory system, but not only that you need to hope you pick a server that 1 the admin is not going to be abusing his powers, and 2 a server that is not going to change maps and you lose all your effort, and 3 one that is not going to be cancelled a week from now and once again you lose all your stuff. Which going back to the THEN part of this section is something you did NOT have to worry about when dayz was more towards rockets vision.

And onto the topic

WHY PEOPLE WILL BE DISAPPOINTED

Lets talk about the title and why I said ""Why The Later SA Is Released, there will be NO private hives, there will simply be the one main Hive that they run. He has said that he does not want to do private hives at first because they want to simply work on fixing bugs and new features at first which will result in possibly large changes that will need to be made on a daily basis to the Hive. No private hives means no ""200+ vehicle servers"", no ""admin maps"", no player tracking, no special starting gear and loadouts, no donator classes, none of that. That right there is huge news to those who think dayz SA is going to be like dayz now just with improvements. Personally I hope Rocket does not allow private hives at all for at least a year

Now for those of you who only play say taviana or only play dayz 2017 and think normal dayz on chernarus sucks


From what I just said a lot of you might be thinking to yourself oh what he said is false

Now for those of you who understand what I have said can think to yourself

Then of course the longer the mod is out and SA is still just ""in development"" players will be buying arma 2 for dayz mod playing it and getting in their heads that is what dayz is and that is what they can expect from SA.


If SA would have released back when Rocket said (end of 2012) more people most likely would have expected what they got as even though its only been 3 months private hives were not as big then as they are now

For those who don't know me, so bare with me and my english.

During my time on Zi, even more when you're a 100% bandit.
As I played a lot on those servers, my opinions were never taken seriously, even though I had a lot of players agreed with me. 
One of the bigger issues were the loadouts before breakingpoint, where I explained in a really serious way, the problems with the loadouts. My post got deleted and the server owner NoHrt, came into my TS channel and told me that if I ever made such a post again, I'd get banned. I didn't bother talking back to him, since he's banned people before for just talking back to him, which is retarded. 

Once Breaking Point came out, figure it out on your own"", if they didn't leave they'd get a temp ban. This resulted in a lot of criticism towards the admins, and they responded with banning every single person who critisized them. I watched all this happen when I was sitting in the general channels talking to people, new and old. So without taking up too many examples, I'd say asking a question to Warchief or Deathlyrage would result in either a conflict, or a kick/ban. I even tried this myself a couple of times

Once Breaking Point was out, I was kicked and temp banned A LOT of times.
The main problem came in when a player called Nemesis was banned, Deathlyrage gave him his own hive, called AGN. This hive could be joined through the launcher. There were different admins there and such. Nemesis offered me admin there, and I said yes. Once I got admin on AGN, the general attitude from Zi-admins got really bad. I could randomly be kicked out of the Zi servers with the message ""Shouldn't you be on your hive?"" and ""Oops, sorry!"". When I then went into the helpdesk and explain this I got temp banned from TS without and explaination. 
As a result of this, the post was not appriciated. Five minutes after the post, Deathlyrage came into my own teamspeak and started raging, calling me names and telling me that the AGN servers were done. I explained that I didn't give two fucks about the AGN servers, and he can kill them if he wants, or he can respond to my post on the forums like a man. Not too unexpected, he killed the servers and deleted my post on the forums. I then made a post where I questioned the thing that my post had been deleted, and messaged me on my own TS, and maybe get a different response. I talked to Griffin, stop being assholes to people
I changed my IP a couple of times and eavsdropped in the helpdesk where a lot of people asked why I got banned. There I was accused of basically threatning to kill people IRL

That's where my story with Zi ends. It's obvious that complaining on the servers is not allowed. Your complaints will be ignored or result in a ban if they're too legit and/or sensitive. 
I don't make this post to cry out in public and try to gain sympathy. I make this post to really warn people about this hive. It is, bad developing and in general bad servers. If you are a regular players on Zi, you probably know about these issues, if you aren't aware of them let me give you a few tips. Don't make a post on the forums where you try to change anything, don't talk to admins without being extremely polite, don't do anything else than play the game. 

One thing that I also want to mention is that thing that has been up on reddit already, he literally asked me to stop talking about it. I've made posts about the idiocy about having a code that takes your CD-key AND checking if you have cheat engine installer on your computer. The posts got deleted, and I got some serious conversations with the admins for once. They didn't want to talk about the thing with the CD-key, but they were willing to talk about the code that checks your computer for Cheat Engine. Apparently, they didn't want hackers of ANY KIND on their servers. They considered it to be immoral to hack or cheat in any games. So even if I used cheat engine to let's say cheat on GTA IV, I wouldn't be welcome on their servers, because it's immoral to cheat. 
My opinion was that they shouldn't give two fucks about where or on what I cheat

Some of the things that don't have anything to do with the admins, the totally over the top spawning of guns. 

Also want to declare that this no admin abuse post

I am referring


Of course these **would not**:

* Rise from the Dead (why? because rocket prefers them to be ""infected"" not ""reanimated"")

* Be controllable 

* Be able to utilize any equipment 

* Retain all of their equipment after turning. (why? mainly because loot respawns so this would bring about inflated numbers of loot spawns

*Have a backpack of any kind


But they **would**:

* Retain all *crippling* damage sustained (so they would be returned to full zombie health but if they had been shot in the knee prior to infection they wouldn't just stand up and sprint around

* Add another facet to the reality and depth of this game!

* Be a *realistic* source of walking loot!

*Be more attentive than normal zombies


Some Problems that have been brought up and my attempts to resolve them:

* ~~**Rocket prefers infection

* **All loot cannot be retained after turning, and determine whether the item is dropped or kept [keep in mind that the backpack and all items in the backpack would already be dropped so we are only talking about items either currently equipped or in the character's immediate inventory]. If they are dropped, then they are dropped [no shit] and will de-spawn like any other normal item. If they are kept, then after the zombie is killed those items will appear just like if you had killed a player. Some Theoretical ""Retention Percentages"" [keep in mind that they would have to be scaled to accommodate an item's rarity not value] AS50 - 1-2%, Bandage - 75-85%, Lee Enfield - 40-60%, Lee Enfield Mags - 50-70%

* **How would you get infected?** [By zombies of course! I don't think every hit from a zombie should result in infection

* **The Transition!** [I would assume something similar to being knocked unconscious and then dying(on your screen) or getting back up and attacking your buddies(on their screen). your backpack and all dropped items[refer to above] would be placed on the ground and then your character would just be a zombie!]

* **Stopping the transition?** [this is an interesting one. of course a bullet could do the trick, not hospitals] or Military transport trucks [they were trying to deliver it but got killed so the truck and antivirus are there!]]

* **If someone turns into a zombie out in the middle of nowhere, then maybe this can be looked at and zombies' positions could be saved to a server and their spawns wouldn't need to be dependent on a player's presence.]

* **The zombie population in Cherno/Elektro would be Huge!** [I know ;) ]

* **Extra server strain/load/lag!** [I got nothing for this one...sorry]


Before you bash or support the idea

For the Imaginatively impaired I have provided a couple that I envisioned!

* You and your friend are raiding Cherno, survivor that you are you make the choice to save yourself! the next day when you log back on and are wandering through Cherno you see your friend! but he is now a zombie and wants to make you the same!

* You are on the north Ridge of Stary Sobor patrolling the horizon with your thermal scope when a blip of dark reddish orange catches your eye. Your heart races as you notice the outline of an AS50 over his shoulder and think about retreating before he sees you but his awkward stance and slow movement piques your curiosity so you observe him more closely with your NVGs and notice that he is in fact an equipped person with an AS50 and a ghillie suit but he is a zombie! Score! Bam goes your M107 and you score some awesome loot!

Again

Feel free to share yours!

EDIT: grammar

EDIT 2: It has been brought to my attention that Rocket prefers a kind of non-reanimation zombie style. I respect this as it is more realistic and believe that this idea could be converted

EDIT 3: I reworked the whole idea to accommodate Rocket's view of zombies and added a section for resolving problems that this idea brings up.

EDIT(S) 4, Grammar, spelling, etc.

I cannot even express in words how frustrated I have become at the absolute absurdity of broken legs in this game... I keep breaking my legs in the most bullshit ways, but not limited to: climbing up/down ladders, going prone near solid objects, falling any distance even as small as a few inches off the front step of a house, getting bumped by another player who apparently weighs thousands of pounds, getting scratched by zombies that are as far as 15 or 20 feet away (out of 5 times I've been hit by zombies since update a few days ago, I have had my legs broken twice).

Today, and as I started to crawl backwards, my legs bumped into a wall, and shattered. Now I am laying, crippled, no hospitals or morphine for miles and miles, waiting to die face down in the mud. 

This wouldn't be so bad if not for a couple of key points-

1- I have never broken a bone in my life, have been skying, sledding, and jump off of all kinds of things taller than 3 or 4 feet. I jump 5 feet to flat concrete on my bmx bike on a regular basis, and have never shattered both my legs so badly that I cannot walk. I have also never seen anybody get their legs smashed by somebody open-palm striking them. Broken legs in this game are the most unrealistic thing I have seen so far... even more unrealistic than the idea of zombies, as those do exist in certain parts of the animal kingdom. 

2- The fact that shattered legs are added as a mechanic to enhance realism, I will leave that be for the moment. My biggest qualm with broken legs in this game, second to the fact that they CAN get broken, is that the supplies needed to fix them are almost impossible to find after this most recent update, which wouldn't be so bad if your legs didn't break every time you crawled backwards, stood up, sat down, or did most any other action necessary to play the game.

I agree- It should be hard to fix broken legs. That is a realistic thing. That being said though

In conclusion, while prone, it's damn near impossible to get in/out of houses, leaving you no way to really find morphine even if you happen to be near places where you might find loot... I think that it needs to be removed from the game entirely, OR perhaps allow you to still walk around, just not sprint, or stand fully upright. If you could only walk in the crouched position, as well as making the solution more common

^^^^.

**Do you think SA will come before April?**

Yes I think so

^^^^.

**Any possible date or time frame for the closed test? Last week you said it would start imminently

We're down to the last few things to fix before the first test servers pop online and we run the first full servers. Slowly we'll hand out the first keys and get a few servers running. Then we will reassess. It could go really well and we open up quickly
Don't expect the tech test to be fun

^^^^.

**Rocket

My real hope, that's the awesome thing about this community.

^^^^.

**I was wondering if you plan to implement a sewer system via instancing in the major cities of Chernarus+?**

I really want too. We'd need to do some magic though (or instancing... but only I am really happy with instancing as a solution at the moment! the programmers want to do it properly).

^^^^.

**Will the ragdoll system be initially available in the SA or you'll implement it later? I have fears about this because of the complexity of the RV engine. Keep up the good work

No ragdoll currently, but it was just going to cause far too much delay.

^^^^.

**Is the idea of making security systems for underground structures still in?
I remember you mentioned that if you ever get objects as their own entities going that you might be able to ""program"" them. .. i.e. grenade attached to a door etc**

I'm playing a lot of Space Station 13 at the moment and it is giving me some tremendous inspiration for ideas for base construction. But expect this more towards the end of this year. We have much ground to cover first.

^^^^.

**Has a chainsaw been added yet?**

Nope

^^^^.

**Do you have anything in the works for more obtainable skins like the hero and bandit skins?**

You can cloth yourself in custom items for each body part. So effectively

^^^^.

**can we expect some unannounced surprises in the standalone release?**

Absolutely. For the next 12 months at least

^^^^.

**From my point of view, and do you agree that this is quite important? Any plans on how to address it?**

It is important, architectural changes.

^^^^.

**I've been quite impressed by seattle map in TOH. Would it be possible to rework the map to make it playable in DayZ?**

It's very impressive map, BI made, that features a western city... let's just say I have plans :)

^^^^.

**Are we going to be able to hide from zombies in trees and bushes? Swarm of zombies

Yes. Although for a few months expect these new mechanics to spontaneously break and hilarity ensu

^^^^.

**Has Marek Spanel (CEO at Bohemia Interactive Studio for those who don't know) played the mod/sa and given any feedback on it?**

Marek has been extremely involved since very early in DayZ (since shortly after it's release really). He continues to be a key contributing member of the team both at a management/steering level and also with design.

^^^^.

**How do you deal with the stress of the game? When you get overloaded with Questions and the difficulties with the development etc

Bizzarely enough
I love KSP and love modding for it
I probably was having a slow-moving nervous breakdown towards the end of last year

^^^^.

**With implementation of clothing slots, degrading rates,)**

All of the above!

^^^^.

**How do you intend to build upon the vehicle system and how you repair vehicles. Will it be a standard hunt for parts or will you be able to remove a few working parts from other damaged vehicles to rebuild your own?**

Not initially, after we have stabilized the build.

^^^^.

**Will there still be a 'dot' system and will it potentially still allow ESP hacks (which are hard to detect)?**

I want to remove the crosshair but I suspect we will have it configurable by servers. Same with 3rd person

^^^^.

**Are you still considering underground bases? It was mentioned early on but not so much since.**

Once we have things really stable and solid

^^^^.

**The end game.
While 'surviving' is a big part of the game
I'm looking it from the perspective of longevity rather than having the game degrade into a FPS with cities
tl;dr - I'm geared up rocket

Firstly
Then towards the end of the year

^^^^.

**Can we expect any new guns/gear upon foundation release?**

yes lots

^^^^.

**Will each gun have their own unique sound in SA? I ask because it can be frustrating not knowing if I'm being shot at by an M24 or a DMR. Knowing the difference would help me know if I should make a break for it or not.**

Recently I've seen a few posts about punishing bandits and how it could be done and how it's for [the greater good](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUpbOliTHJY).  I'm here to tell you why any restriction on banditry is completely out of context with a post-apocalyptic scenario.  I will frame this argument in two concepts; society and survival.

If you're playing DayZ you most likely live in a developed country.  You can walk/drive to your local grocery store and buy pretty much anything you want at anytime

That's the simultaneous beauty and curse of society.  It's easy to live in a society.  All we have to do is agree certain things are to be frowned upon.  Characteristics of our evolutionary ability to survive are supressed in favor of a collective effort toward that very goal.  We develop consciences and mores which determine our behaviors.  We disdain banditry because it isn't necessary to carry on living anymore.  The goal is no longer survival.  The goal is comfort.

Now imagine if all of this was stripped away over the course of a few weeks.  Food supply would break down.  Electricity would disappear as nuclear

In the United States

Most people don't have the skills to survive *any* catastrophic event.  We have become soft as a species.  Throw in a highly aggressive threat such as zombies and resource gathering becomes a mortal trial.  Society disappears and the laws prohibiting behavior with it.  Killing other people for your own sake becomes a necessary normality.

It would, unstoppable killing machines in each town and city.  Of course, it makes sense for people to band together for surival.  This happens in DayZ as it would in real life.  The killings happen too.

I've said this before and I'll say it again.  Everyone in DayZ is a bandit.  People who kill in DayZ and feel remorse or guilt

I take no credit for this other than simply putting it on here from browsing SA

""Hey, so I'm just gonna go through how the conversation went.

I first addressed him by saying that I love his mod, and is willing to take risks in this way on games that may or may not clearly make money right away. I agreed, considering that Arma is basically a simulation engine and not necessarily a game. Because of this attitude, he said, he has been instructed directly to stop his work as a multiplayer designer so that he can focus exclusively on Day Z, and that he believes that Day Z is the first step towards Bohemia gearing up to make it into a full standalone game out of recognition for the opportunity to make something very different and the clear interest people have in it. He went on to say that it being a standalone title is important if only for the sake of consistency and ease of play, as mods are not the most stable or easy-to-use games

I told him that the fans are playing it in droves, on that note, the forums are blowing up with ""WHERES ROCKET"" and bug reports while he's here at E3. He laughed and said he's been trying to not visit the forums while he's gone cuz he knows he's gonna get pissed. I then went ahead and asked him if he thought the mod would end up on Arma 3. He said he'd already sort of ported it to try it out (!!!), and that it works great. The main reason he ""released"" Day Z so early as an alpha was to allow for it to be stress-tested, as it is primarily a network-based game. At this juncture, I asked if he saw it ending up with more players-per-server in the future. He said DEFINITELY, that it's been tested internally and he thinks it could handle between 100-200 players easily (!!!!!). The thought of the anti-bandit rage this would induce gave me a semi. Anyway, and that such numbers are in fact a natural fit.

I asked him if he thought he'd be doing away with 'meta' elements, opportunely enough, I noticed his shirt. He said he'd had a bunch made, but that they didn't ship in time for the show so he had a small batch printed up when he got here so he could wear one. Said he took the idea from 4chan. I asked him if he'd let 'them' know about it yet, and by 'them' that I meant the entire internet. He said no, so I said ""well shall we?""""

In The Last of Us, and because the zombies are difficult, being able to stealth around and avoid zombie interactions is very satisfying and promotes less of a 'run and gun' game style.

The problem with the dayz zombies is not that they are fast, as long as it does not have vision on you, and not agro it.

This would allow zombies to still be fast and powerful

What does not need fixing is things like camping bandits, people aren't going to leave their shooting position so you can have your chance at getting into a military complex filled with guns.
ARMA 2 is a military simulation. The expansion pack, and in a one to one fight, the BLUFOR (Americans and Brits) almost always win. Does this need balancing? No. It is a simulation of a real life conflict, much like DayZ is intended to be. 
What I'm getting at here is the suggestions like ""Have a marker that gives a more and more specific location of bandits, which is really an anti-game, as Rocket called it himself.

Basically zombies would have three states:

Investigate (walking towards a sound made by a player walking

Idleing walking around AND

Attacking

There only seems to be the latter two states in the current dayz. Imagine fireing a gun on one side of a town

A similar mechanic kind of exists at the moment with throwable trash and scrap

Then its delayed some more.. and more.. Why? because dean simply wants to make a great game, What more could we ask for?

I really only have a couple of reasons

Having a lack of advantages over a player other than possibly owning a weapon, something DayZ has, that no other MMO I've played has explored. There's a genuine feel that 'Wow, I got a military grade weapon, I am every bit the equal of the 34 day survival guys'.

There's no feeling of 'Man I better level up reloading, but I don't think it suits DayZ.

That brings me to the second point, and even if it is possible, it would have little benefit, in a game where survival is measured in days, not months.

The average player, and as such, people who are good enough to continue on, will only gain further ways of ruining these people's shit. 

It's lose-lose; either make it slow/hard to notice to avoid grinding, for the first week of a character's life, or you make it quick, so as to be accessible, and it will be abused.

I also disagree with the idea of 'limits on the amount that can be trained' solution. All that does is essentially introduce a new toy, or how skillful they are.

That's my two cents

If zombies had set attributes but in varying levels of intensity they would prove to be more unpredictable and formidable foes.

Games are generally more enjoyable if they have randomly generated content

Zombies should have a randomly allocated intensities of particular traits.

**SPEED**

* An incredibly fast zombie that can outrun you.
* A zombie that has the same pace as you. (Simlar to the speed we have now)
* A zombie that is slower than you which you can outrun relatively easily.
* A walking zombie.
* A crawling zombie with perhaps no legs or its guts hanging out its chest.

**VISUAL ACUITY**

* Varying from Excellent to Poor or None Existent.

**AUDITORY ACUITY**

* Varying from Excellent to Poor or None Existent.

**VOCALITY**

(Levels of vocality can be heard from different distances and attract zombies/survivors)

* Varying from Screaming to a Groan or Mute.

So individual zombies could potentially but rarely be; easily to alert; fast; screamers. But also; Blind

This would make venturing into zombie populated areas more dangerous and unpredictable for those in groups and on their own. This could provide more depth for distractions in group play (player shouts to distract zombies whilst team members loot or escape) forcing people to work together in order to succeed.

**TL;DR** Implementing a system where zombies are randomly allocated varying intensities of; Speed

##What is Direct Communication?

Direct communication is one of several channels that players can communicate to others in. You are surely already familiar with the Side channel (blue text) -- in a normal game of ArmA 2, everyone is on the same Side, so it acts like Global chat. The group channel (green text) talks to everyone in your sub-group on your side. Again, everyone is in the same group, so this is global. The actual Global channel (White text) talks to everybody. The vehicle channel (yellow) talks to everyone in your vehicle.

Direct Communication is unique in that it talks to everyone *in proximity* to you. In the latest ArmA 2 beta, your voice is 3D-positioned, meaning that people can not only hear your voice, but they can hear *where* it is coming from. Your voice gets softer as they get further away from you. And the cherry on top: when you talk in the Direct channel, your character's mouth moves along with what you are saying.

Unfortunately, which broadcasts to the whole server. It is annoying and makes the server lag, so it's frowned upon, making the only way of talking to other arbitrary players in-game global text chat.

Newer ArmA 2 beta patches fixed the Direct comms bug

##Why does this matter?

The latest DayZ patch, and it will *require* you to be updated to the latest beta of ArmA 2. And with that, **all DayZ servers will be disabling all chat channels except for Direct Communication.** So you better get used to it, and get it set up to be ready.

*Side note:* If you don't have a mic, and people will shoot you if you take too long to type ""friendly"" when they talk to you and ask you.

##How to set it up

First, but there have been reports of people having problems with this beta so I recommend getting 93701. Beta installation [very easy](http://dayz.sykotix.com/arma-ii-beta-client-install/).

Also, which is already out.

Next, and . keys. But since the only channel you need in DayZ is Direct, I don't bother with the rest - it's too clumsy. What you'll probably want to do is remove the keybind for ""Push-To-Talk"" (which will talk over your currently-selected chat channel) and instead bind that key to ""Talk on Direct Communications"".

[Example screenshot](http://i.imgur.com/tGNC3.png)

Next

[Example screenshot](http://i.imgur.com/Phwne.png)

Finally, a microphone icon appears and it says ""Direct communication"" in the bottom left corner. It looks like this:

[Example screenshot](http://i.imgur.com/okcHF.jpg)

Now, or haven't bothered to set up Direct comms like you have.

I first noticed this phenomena when the beta patch disabled gamma controls. A lot of vets seemed to think wandering blind or revealing your presence with flares was a noble nighttime endeavor (the rub being the vets have night vision so they could careless about noob struggles).  The new folks just wanted night be more like a full moon but for some reason that was a bridge too far for some of the louder voices in the vet side of the community.

It again became apparent reading through all the threads over the weekend that vets who hadn't died really had no clue what was happening to new players.  I described a few of my experiences [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/dayz/comments/v7zt6/anyone_else_avoiding_playing_until_the_latest/c525cat?context=3) and [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/dayz/comments/v7uij/in_1711_there_is_currently_a_bug_with_food_and/c5256as?context=3) but certainly that isn't an all encompassing view.  

The reality was with the undocumented prone nerf, food-less, bandage deficient survivors to make positive progress without resorting to old and new exploitation (well documented on r/dayz).  Generally all parts of the community believe players should not be driven to that type of behavior.  

But again

**Whenever DayZ does testing on any major gameplay feature (e.g., all the duped items get blown away and it is a clean slate again.  The player alive time count also begins to fairly represent at the macro level how these changes are affecting lifespans.  Anyway, who can complain about wiping of player data?  It is *just* an alpha after all and we are *just* testers.

**TL:DR** - To balance the game from past exploitation and to bring the DayZ vet and newb community into alignment more quickly about game changes

My idea: From now on when you pass out, but everything is played through a filter, as if you were still hearing sounds but while underwater. Everything is muffled, you can hardly differentiate sounds, you can't see anything, and you know something BAD is happening to you.

What this does: This gives players a real sense of urgency and chaos. They don't know whats going on. Your survivor buddy could be dragging out of harms reach or you could be getting your organs torn into by a zombie. The best part is: You won't know until you wake back up.

You used to be able to crouch run through an area and not have to worry that some magic zombie behind a building is going to show up and eat your face. Now, and any slight movement is loud as hell.

My most recent attempt was a failure, I could have gone prone in the corner as I did, and no one would have noticed me. Instead the descent of zombies turn on me and eat my legs while I lay there.

Also, especially as the community explodes in size. As long as we keep in mind that we shouldn't flat out complain, but encourage discussion, and be patient with this epic mod's early state.

Another user commented with a quote that ""server files available to all on release"".

Rocket,

&gt;Linux server build is very likely. Server footprint is only 1.2gb. Bandwidth is TBA

In doing so he seemingly qualified that servers will be hosted by players and that server files will be ""available to all on release"". His comments on operating system compatibility further suggest that individuals will in fact have access to server files and that DayZ SA will follow in DayZ Mod's footsteps where you can play your character on servers owned by other players. Moderators at DayZMod further qualified these facts in conversation.

I am here to tell you that this is by definition a security hole. Allowing characters from third party servers to join official Bohemia servers (if there are any) is a huge mistake. Team Fortress 2 uses a similar model and that brings comfort to some. What I am here to tell you is the fundamental difference and why Bohemia is the only company in the world to ever attempt using this model and why it is a mistake.

If there are servers and they are allowed to interact with a central server then the communication is either trusted or it is not trusted. If the communication between the two is not trusted then that is a security hole. The communication between a third party server can not be trusted. Valve knew that and that is why loot is not gained based on what a third party server says. In Team Fortress 2 you gain loot by and only by the total amount of time the central server sees you playing the game. It does not allow any third party servers to tell it what to do. Bohemia plans to do the opposite and it is a mistake.

Bohemia is currently planning for the players to shoulder the burden of server hosting. They are also planning for servers hosted by third parties to be a part of the whole that defines where your character can play. That is a huge mistake and there must not be any third party servers.

Based on this information

- Read the application's memory during run time (cheat)
- Modify the application's memory during run time (cheat)
- Modify incoming packets to their server (cheat &amp; harass other players)
- Block incoming packets to their server (soft ban player's ip address)

Here are some things that professional programmers / software engineers are capable of doing that would be nearly impossible to detect (with the exception of cases with extreme abuse)

- Send fake information to the central server (cheat)
- Make fake requests to the central server for sensitive information",self,t5_2ty3s,1372528305.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/dayz/comments/1hbiq1/it_is_critical_that_there_are_no_third_party/

I first played DayZ when there were around 10-20 servers in existence for the mod.  I had played Arma 2 previously and was a fan of the game, for the next 6 months I was hooked on this game, I played hundreds of hours.  It was and still is one of the most unique and outstanding gaming experiences I've ever had.  There are moments I will never forget, like the first time I killed another player, defending myself from two bandits who killed my friend (I managed to kill both).  The fear, my heart beating out of my chest and the absolute relief and satisfaction after several tense minutes moving round Devil's Castle when I finally killed the second guy.

My first night in game I ran around with a friend in mostly darkness, there were no loot maps, vague information on spawns and everything was new to almost every player on the server, no one seemed to have them.  Eventually we were picked off by a sniper running around Cherno cluelessly, a hard awakening to the grim realities of Chernarus.  

My second night playing with my friend we began to interact with other players more, he had been playing the game longer than us and helped us out with some advice and tips on the game, a nice guy.  We hung round with him and eventually met up with others on the server, always asking if friendly, each encounter was tense and seemed entirely unique.  There were moments that I'll never forget.  Eventually that evening we amassed a group of 8 of us, everyone from a different country.  We then hopped on someones teamspeak server and spent the rest of the night as a group roaming around and exploring what seemed like an endless mysterious landscape.  

We had no NVG's and we did not know the HDR trick, there was panic.  I remember the experience fondly.  I also remember the darkness and the edge that gave to the entire thing.  There is nothing quite like the panic of running through a town being chased by zombies you can barely see, or encountering a player in almost pitch darkness and having to somehow navigate the experience.

I remember the thrill of having to use a flare and light yourself up at night just to be able to function.  I remember the thrill of seeing flares used by other players and suddenly realising ""oh shit there is another guy just down the road from me"" in pitch darkness.  Cherno used to be covered in flares as you approached it, then suddenly realising something was stopping my run only to look down and see a player with his winchester in my face as mine was in his.  The following conversation was tense but amazingly resulted in neither of us shooting one another.  I can remember so many amazing experiences and many of them tied to the fact that darkness was actual real darkness.

Then I learnt about the HDR trick and darkness became not so dark.  I also learnt about the game pretty quickly and found myself able to tool up with excellent equipment fast.  With the HDR trick NVG's weren't even that essential, I felt more comfortable now of course.  

For the following months I played the game and enjoyed it a great deal, but also that night time wasn't actually night time any more for me, just a green filter on a computer screen.  Zombies were no threat whatsoever, I was in control of my environment, the edge the darkness brought was meaningless, the game may aswell have been constant daylight.  As things progressed eventually it was hard to even find a server that was populated whilst it was dark.  Everyone just went to daylight servers and those who were on night servers were probably kitted out with NVG's anyway.   

You had to use the NVG's or the HDR trick of course

I realise that so many people who came to play DayZ late probably missed out on those amazing experiences I had early on.  They never got to enjoy what it is like to be on a full server in pitch darkness when no one had NVG's and no one could see in the dark in any way.  People naturally banded together more because zombies were a whole lot more dangerous when it is actually dark.

I've recently come back to the game in anticipation of SA release and I have been playing a lot of the mods that have come out.  Which has been great.  

I know everyone is comfortable with their NVGs now, yes it is more comfortable and makes the game easier to see at night.  I get it and I at one point early on craved the ability to see at night also.  We all like to be comfortable.  

Looking back though I realise that the darkness added something to the game, but isn't that part of the fun?   Some players have never even experienced what true server wide darkness is like in DayZ.  Having to use chemlights and flares at night is thrilling and adds a new dimension to the game, the zombies that people have complained about not being a threat actually become a far more serious threat when you can't see 5m in front of you without assistance.  Atmospherically the darkness adds to the experience and on top of that the darkness is another reason for players to not just shoot each other on sight and actually try to team up, because the PvE is far trickier when you can't see shit.

I don't want to be punished for attaining good gear in terms of the game experience.  Attaining NVG's removes an edge to the game, because I am giving a huge advantage away to any bandit.  I don't want to have to be dumb to embrace the full experience this game has to offer.  

I am posting here because I want to humbly ask Rocket to seriously consider this as an option before the release of SA.  It would be a bold decision

A bit rambly and long

Now I play ArmA with my son (14)

After leaving DayZ for a couple months and only playing Wasteland

As funny as this is going to sound, it's the social interaction. Maybe even the hope of restoring faith in humanity by the off chance that you'll find someone who won't shoot you in the face for no reason.

When you play games which allow you to pick a team to play with, but it's not nearly as bonding as DayZ encounters can be; where people actually have to earn your trust, not just pick opfor/bluefor.

I've made DayZ friends that I would probably trust in real life

The other day my son's character got killed by an infected swarm making a lucky hit on him while we were being hunted by bandits in Berezino. I actually felt bad/sad for him. I made my way back to his body and retrieved his CZ 550 as he re spawned on the coast.

As I was making my way to him he met up with a couple friendlies and stuck with them until he was gunned down [unarmed] by a bandit. I had that worried dad feeling as I just wanted to be able to protect my son and avenge him

This time I met up with him in Balota before he got to his friends in Cherno. He was nearly dead again

He met his friends in the apartments and I watched from 500 meters away with my M40.

Trouble found his group of 3 when they were looting the firehouse. A couple of bandits trapped them in the firehouse. I could hear shooting but I didn't have a good shooting solution from my hide. I could have easily picked my son's entire team off in the tower

I ranged the door to the firehouse using the mildots and a card I made with common measurements of in-game objects. A size card I created by creating a mission where I had a mildot scope and range finder and went around reversing the range finding formula on things like doors, street signs, etc. (I play on a first person server with no range finding, no map waypoints in the hud, and no map player icons).

I doped my scope to 500m

It was then that I alluded to my son that I was still in the game

His friends were alarmed that there were now sniper rounds in addition to the nearby bandits

The bandit, to my side, to bandage himself from my last shot, at which time I relieved him from the responsibility of holding up his cumbersome head.

The bandit's partner decided that 3

My son and I earned the respect of the people he was playing with and since they protected my son

As much as I hate the shoot on sight and bandits

It took me quite a lot of searching, WITHOUT using the 'Keep running in this direction and hope you don't die of thirst/hunger' method. I'll try to keep this short and sweet:

*Note - If you're stuck in the debug forest skip to step #4*

*****

**1. Verify that you're stuck in the plains across multiple servers:**

Logging out of the debug plains immediately and logging in to another server may sometimes fix the problem. If you are permanency stuck in the debug plains

**2. Log out of your current server. Log in to Canada 2:** 

Canada 2 seems to be the only server which worked for me, which is much easier to escape from. 

*The moment you log in

&gt;""If this fix isn't working for you

**3. Log back in to the server of your choice:** 

Optional

**4. Walk South-East for a minute

&gt;**Can't find South-East?**: If you don't have a compass or GPS, log in to a server with the current time somewhere around 8-11 AM. The shadows should be facing west). **EDIT**: [Alililele points out that the clouds in DayZ always travel from west to east.](http://www.reddit.com/r/dayz/comments/w0g59/you_can_escape_the_debug_plains_without_losing/c5980r2) This is particularly helpful if you don't have a watch or are otherwise unsure what time the server operates on.

Rather than walking for anywhere between 15 minutes and half an hour, you'll eventually find yourself near Zelenogorsk. Either way, you've still got your weapons, items, stats and if you're lucky, spawning in the debug forest may have restored your blood, health and/or food.

*****

Hope that helps - Remember, please let me know in the comments. Likewise, if this method hasn't worked for you or you've found an alternate/easier method please post them and I'll add them to the original post. Good luck and happy bean-hunting!

**EDIT:** I should probably add, if you have any suggestions or methods of your own please share them so other players can see.

**EDIT 2:** Cleaned up formatting a bit.

**EDIT 3:** Adamater [posted an alternative solution in the comments](http://www.reddit.com/r/dayz/comments/w0g59/you_can_escape_the_debug_plains_without_losing/c596hf9) that may work for some players: 

&gt;*""I got put in the debug plains yesterday, I was in the plains but pretty close to the edge of the map now. I log out, when I log back in today I was at cap golova and I still had all my gear. If anyone wants to try it put the host as 1.7.1.1, there is only one with it.""*

**EDIT 4:** Confirmed that Canada 2 is still working. 

**EDIT 5:** Alililele pointed out that [clouds in DayZ always travel West to East](http://www.reddit.com/r/dayz/comments/w0g59/you_can_escape_the_debug_plains_without_losing/c5980r2) - Very handy to know if you don't have a watch!

**EDIT 6:** Bonzomadrid2 [pointed out](http://www.reddit.com/r/dayz/comments/w0g59/you_can_escape_the_debug_plains_without_losing/c598dak) that connecting to Canada 2 via Six-launcher may prevent this method from working.

I've had to do some crazy shit to deal with stream snipers and griefers. Setting up and 8 minute delay (which comes with its entire own set of problems), having an overlay that consumes 20% of the screen, etc...etc...Just a lot of annoying shit. But through all of this, the game's been fun enough to play, regardless of the stupid shit that happens.

Then I made a grave mistake. A mistake that's going to keep me from ever streaming this game again.

I got 5-6 friends

[Holy fucking shit

Getting into 2-3 hour wars with other groups of people, etc...etc...Basically, playing the game off stream was an entirely different experience.

I like to think I've had an overall positive impact on the community. I've exposed tons of people to the game and the mod (I've had dozens and dozens of people e-mail me/tell me they've purchased Arma 2 because of me) and I've always cast the game in a positive light. I was tired of shitty servers

I feel like after playing that it's going to be hard to bring myself to ever stream this game again. It just seems so much better off stream

It seems kind of sad that a stream that can easily hold 4-5k viewers for this mod (plus videos posted to 60k sub youtube channel) has to just disappear because of snipers + hackers. Any suggestions or ideas from anyone?

If Frankie wasnt hacking

UPDATE: The user Univerbal summed the whole thread up in a [video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8pmqaTOc_g)



The whole text is about this video: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeCK823BArc (watch it before downvoting) Sorry

Frankie's new video contains a scene where he eliminates a whole squad. Pretty impressing
I had the same opinion. The video is awesome
I am playing on the same server and I began to wonder as I took a closer look at the video. 
There are two points showing that Frankie is obviously using some kinda hack. 

The debug monitor. I know
Here's a little comparison of the two debug monitors: 
[This](http://i.imgur.com/ZxKGN.png) is Frankie's debug monitor and [this](http://i.imgur.com/rRI8n.jpg) is the actual debug monitor of the DayZ Taviana Mod. It's easy to see the difference and what's interesting about that, so the only way to get it, is to modify this file. 

If you do this, you need to bypass battleye. 

However

The answer is no

5 people shooting at him without him taking a single hit
I know a bit about hacks and in DayZ it's pretty easy to spot a godmode. 
The temperature icon is blinking, it's clearly blinking. 

EDIT: Maybe my conclusion was a bit harsh, but I am still looking forward to someone proving me wrong. 


UPDATE: Frankie stated his thoughts and the majority of you seem to agree with him. After rereading his text, but he keeps lying. 

In point (i) he writes

&gt; (i) Blinking Temperature monitor This blinks throughout. The glitchy rain in DayZ is partly the cause

This doesnt blink throughout
[Here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_xgoNNJ290) (thanks to rawb2k) is a nice video, as it is blinking in the exact same intervals like the one of the hacker.

In point (iii) he's writing that he updated his DayZ version from 1.7.3 to 1.7.4.4 and this fucked up his debug monitor.
Seems pretty logic, when you update your vanilla DayZ. So this explanation is just wrong, it doesnt explain his different debug monitor. 

However

Answer is no, I dont care if he dubbed it later on or not, it's just the fact that the player ""Schweinewurst"" has a different debug monitor than Frankie, so it isnt a serverside bug. 

But why would Frankie ask Jack
Let me ask you, when it could be the evidence that he uses a hack.
However


Frankie is a charming guy and pretty likable, that he is lying, but some of you should really open their eyes and look at the evidence before calling me a jealous kid. 

UPDATE 2: So far we have some wrong explanations from Frankie
Please frankiefanboys, explain the debug monitor and the temperature icon, because these are serious indications for a hacker.

For some of you this seems really obvious but after browsing the last couple days as we get closer to release its obvious to me that not everyone understands what that means. 

For the purpose of clarifying. 
Most games go through alpha then into beta to then a stable release (games like call of duty) Standalone will follow the minecraft format and go from alpha to beta and will probably stay in alpha as it will be constantly updated with new features. 

 I must reiterate

If anyone feels I missed anything or if they have any corrections I should make feel free to let me know.

About a week ago I decided to bite the bullet and purchase ARMA and play DayZ after seeing a fair bit of stuff popping up about it. For the first couple of days he would occasionally look over and watch me playing


He has caught on quick and has actually saved me a few times from some hairy situations. Now each night we log on and just roam around together; finding vehicles

**Rocket's Note**

&gt;This is the first community + development team generated update for the DayZ mod. It is the culmination of a huge amount of work by both the community and the development team. The half-done 1.7.3 patch was made available to the community

*A call of action.*

Blood literally means life in game


So what I am asking is for this awesome community to **bring out the Hero inside of us

**How?**

Find your local blood drives through [here](http://www.redcrossblood.org/our-regions)

Go to the local blood drives on the week of **September 1st through the 7th.**

Reply with either a pic of your donation

**What are the restrictions?**

Well first off

And you can look up the rest of the official policies for donors [here](http://www.redcrossblood.org/donating-blood/eligibility-requirements/eligibility-criteria-topic)


**What made you decide to think of this?** 

When I was shopping for school supplies, but after months of playing Dayz I knew that someone in real life needed a Hero, to give them a blood pack.

So for the first time ever I donated blood, if we all gave blood, and what it would mean for the thousands of people out there that badly need it. 



**So whether it's saving a Bambi in Cherno or your neighbor

This could prompt people to either congregate towards larger cities for protection or to band together as bandits in the woods

Bandit groups could even take it as far as to impersonate enforcers or to mount full scale invasions on police controlled cities in order to grab the loot and kill and pillage as they are fond of doing.

What do you guys think?

Onto the rant.

The guy behind DayZ Origins is a control freak. I've heard reports from multiple server admins of multiple communities now

He is effectively making money off of a mod of a mod of a game. This is ridiculous. You want your mod out there, and force admins to use your **inferior** and **much slower** servers? What the hell is wrong with you?

I hear EA Games is hiring

Seriously

I love Origins, instead of forcing them to use your servers so **you** can make a small **profit**. Put up a donation page with some google adsense in the background, now you're making a little bit of money without pissing anyone off.

Seriously

TLDR - Horses have four legs and eight times the average body weight of a human with an average BMI and a height of less than 7 feet.

**UPDATE**: Wow! I didn't expect this thread to get this kind of attention! Now I feel a little silly with my corny EA jokes. Anyway

 - Ever tried playing Origins from Australia? The single 'authorized' provider cannot host down under

 - TopHatLarry posted a pastebin conversation that happened with the creator and those involved with Origins. Its a very enlightening read

 - Admin Peep from BMRF.me came here and shared his experiences with the guys behind Origins. His comment is the most upvoted post of this thread. Here is a direct link to it though

On the DE4 Dayz server hosted by OCUK and Murder Inc Clan the following happened:

My friend Brogotten found a camp of 5+ vehicles and killed a guy called Yldee (I believe he is in the clan that runs the server)

 Excited as we are we spammed refresh on the server list to get in DE4 again ( note this was our favorite server where we played on all the time ). When the server popped up on the list again it was locked and only 5 people were in. This included Yldee

Then the server would be locked after the restart presumably for the admins and their clan to go retrieve the helicopter again from the spawn point

 When the server unlocked 5 min after it was restarted (We are on our way to Brogotten at this point) Brogotten got killed by Ydlee and some other guys that all off a sudden appeared around the camp. while pre-server crash these guys weren't anywhere near. (They must of thought Brogotten stole a helicopter or car which is why they crashed the server)

Then when we confronted Yldee with the weird timing on the server crash we got responses like: ""mad ?"". Which in my opinion only confirmed our thoughts that On DE4 Dayz server the admins use the server reset

This is the same if not worse than cheating in this game and something must be done to stop abusive admins like this, surely this is the same type of thing?

Thanks and if you have any advice on how to properly report it let me know.

TLDR:
Admins on DE4 Restarted the server after dying to make sure they kept their vehicles and loot. They also constantly restart it to keep helicopters. That's bullshit.

1. My friend (the driver of the ATV) is either laughing or crying

2. I am unconscious.

3. I am at 45.83 units of blood.

As I don my microphone all I can muster is a weak and confused ""Wut?""

In short gasps in what I now recognize is hysterical laughter

""Went around Dubrovka"" 

*gasps for air*

""Wanted to avoid roadblocks""

*breaks into more laughter*

""Chicken...""

*Laughs hysterically for about 15 seconds*

""Chicken... sprinted under tire...""

*starting to calm down at this point*

""We flew 10 meters into the air while doing 60kmh!""

*Breaks into laughter again and becomes incomprehensible*

I regain consciousness at this point, and then there's the chicken. The chicken is standing ~40m from the crash, staring at us like he owns the place. After he catapulted us, my friend bailed off our vehicle before it exploded, and dragged my unresponsive ass off the ATV and out of the village, and patched me up, all while fending off half the zeds in Dubrovka.
I look back at the chicken

""This bastard is going down

I unsling the AS50 from my back

BANG.

As our fowl foe falls over dead

No chicken has escaped our wrath since that day.

1344037563.0,xnaok,Important: Server Owners Need To Read This,Zhoir,299,34,60,"A lot of the reddit servers on the sidebar and the majority of servers in general have been comprimised by 4chan.

IF you still have your cfgdayz and battleye folders in your root directory where you launch your DAYZ Server from then they can run a script and find out what your rcon password is to access your server remotly or in-game.

This allows them to ban anyone

I have seen quite a few servers on the sidebar in a post on 4chan recently (not going to name them but I will notify everyone I can via PM on here)

**To fix this** (so far it has worked for us) 

- you need to move your cfgdayz folder and battleye folders outside of your root server directory.

- Then edit your start_dayz.bat file to point to the new directorys location of where you have moved the folders to.

Example:
""C:\Users\Administrator\dir\Arma 2\Expansion\beta\arma2oaserver.exe"" -port=2302 -mod=EXPANSION\beta;EXPANSION\beta\Expansion;EXPANSION;ca;@dayz;@hive **-name=cfgdayz -config=C:\Users\Administrator\dir\cfgdayz\server.cfg -cfg=C:\Users\Administrator\dir\cfgdayz\arma2.cfg -profiles=C:\Users\Administrator\dir\cfgdayz-bepath=C:\Users\Administrator\dir\BattlEye** -world=Chernarus -cpuCount=3 -exThreads=3

The stuff i've highlighted in bold is what I have changed. As you can see I pointed it towards where I moved the cfgdayz folder and battleye folder. For security reasons I replaced the directory I used with ""dir."" Simply change dir to the directory you move the folders to.

This SHOULD stop people from grabbing your passwords. **EVERY server is at risk right now who have not done this.** I believe even Vipeax's server was exploited the same way. 

I know this goes againsted our rules of posting anything related to hacking but as I am providing a fix and a lot of reddit servers have been exploited I decided to allow it.",self,t5_2ty3s,False,,mod,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/dayz/comments/xnaok/important_server_owners_need_to_read_this/

I know you were just trying to be a 'bad ass' bandit when you leant over the roof and shot me in the back as I and my friend bumbled about below. We were messing around

After that first shot my friend figured out where you were hiding and little did you know that as you logged out and back he had lined his sights on your face. You didn't go down without a fight however and lag meant that you killed each other

By this time I had respawned several times to get back to cherno. I ran as fast as my little legs could carry me past zombies and loot piles alike. I climbed the stairs my breath heavy with the strain and managed to find the 2 of your bodies. I looted quickly

And then I heard it. 

The scrape of a foot as it slowly brushed against a step. 

I had seen you rapidly respawning, back to a certain roof. I quickly hid the 2 bodies. No point in letting you get any of the spoils of your foul deed. No I had far worse in store for you. 

As I climbed down the ladder to the top of a set of stairs I turned and saw you just rounding the last flight. You paused and looked me in the eye as your 2 empty hands flapped helplessly in front of you. 

I took one step towards you and whispered across the mic ""You got a real purdy mouth

I gave chase and fired one shot which winged off the stairs. I came to the bottom to see you go into full sprint and disappear around the corner. I followed but managed to lose sight of you briefly. Knowing you'd be a cunning bastard I rounded the small building in the other direction hoping to find you coming around the other way and that you were doubling back. Running right at me your little face filled with terror as you saw me iron site and fire one shot

You turned slightly towards a gap in the wall and I heard a sickening crunch and scream as my bullet did it's work. I quickly ran over to where you had fallen. What happened next was possibly the funniest moment I've ever had in a game and may well have scarred you slightly. 

I had the bright idea to grab your body.

You were clearly here to cause trouble

Further and further we went until finally I dropped you in the road and paused. I whispered once more in your ear that I loved you and shot you in the head.

So yeah. That was pretty funny. Hope you're OK now,False,self,t5_2ty3s,False,,,t3_vjsxu

* 1. Dogs are in it (this isn't news per se*
* 2. They will be controlled by the player by whistling. Slow down, etc. will all be controlled by different whistles.
* 3. You will have to feed it (raw steaks) and water (water bottle).
* 4. It looks like they can track (not sure if this is finished or if they can just track animals or other players) and warn (they watch out for *danger*
* 5. Stealth has been modified (haven't compared it to a older version but from playing I'm positive it's made easier to stealth past zombies).
* 6. How the gear is synced has been modified (probably the ammo count fix).
* 7. maxLocalZombies was changed from 30 to 40

That is what I've found so far

I think I found where the skin changes regarding the humanity:
&gt;		_model = ""Survivor2_DZ"";
&gt;		if (_humanity &lt; -2000) then {
&gt;			_model = ""Bandit1_DZ"";
&gt;		};
&gt;		if (_humanity &gt; 5000) then {
&gt;			_model = ""Survivor3_DZ"";
&gt;		};

Here is how the dogs will work: http://i.imgur.com/bLN7z.jpg

This made LOL,3) is played when the dog whines :P

Edit: 5. might have something to do with dogs

1346200999.0,yzr9i,"A Slightly More Advanced DayZ Guide
",38,75,http://www.reddit.com/r/dayz/comments/yzr9i/a_slightly_more_advanced_dayz_guide/,"i originally wrote most of this as a comment, but i've added some additional things for players who are past the ""oh god where did i spawn how do i shot web"" phase of DayZ. 

**Survival Tips:**

stay low, tops of mountains, or crests of hills).

here are some things that will make you easily noticable when you're moving around Chernarus:

* Shape
* Shine
* Shadow 
* Sound
* Movement
* Colour

a couple of those you can only really take care of with camo clothing or a ghillie suit, and movement. 

* crouch or go prone to take care of shape. i only press C to stand if i know i'm going to have to full-out sprint.

* shine is one of the lesser concerns, and avoid putting sunglasses on them. you can edit your config file to get camo paint on your survivor, you'll just have to find the code for the face type you want from [here](http://community.bistudio.com/wiki/ArmA_2:_CfgIdentities#List) and append _camo# to it. # goes from 1 to 6, generally. 

* sound discipline is of paramount importance. the sounds of different guns in the game are very recognizable, press forward and as soon as the animation for a step is half-done, let go. you'll have moved a little bit and made no sound. repeat until you're where you need to go. this also works for crouch and prone positions, but it's slow as molasses. useful if you're sneaking up on snipers on dobry!

* lastly is movement. this is actually a lot harder to control if you don't have 3rd person view on in the servers you're playing in. i've spotted guys in ghillie suits hiding in pine trees by the way they waggle their guns and their legs around while looking for people to snipe. if you're prone, and you won't have your lee-enfield or whatever waving like a flag for bandits to lock their crosshairs on to. when in doubt go prone and press shift to slow-crawl to heavy cover. 

**Raiding Tips:** 

* always check behind you. i can't tell you the number of people i've stalked from just 100-150m behind

* always have an exit strategy. as much as possible never get into a situation where the only way out is to fight. if you have to engage, or an easy escape. there are some desperate maneuvers that you can pull in a bad spot, but don't count on them working all the time. i personally like the ninja vanish, where i throw a smoke grenade at my own feet and sprint the hell out of there. 

* always assume that someone is watching. enough said. i forget about this sometime as well

* always scope out a place before looting it. make sure a location is 100% clear before you go in. are there zeds? did you spawn them? have you heard gunfire within the last 10 minutes? don't go in there if you don't know the answer to those questions. otherwise shit will go down something like this: hey look, you didn't. you die. 

**Gearing Tips:** 

* nobody ever, otmel, krutoy cap, etc) it's a good place to check straight off the bat. i've found 3 skodas there within a week of playing/dying/regearing. 

* common locations for camps: [Black Forest](http://dayzdb.com/map#5.092.077), The north/north-west areas of [Ostry,](http://dayzdb.com/map#5.107.021) forests south-west of [Lopatino](http://dayzdb.com/map#4.018.063), forests far north of [Olsha](http://dayzdb.com/map#5.133.021). you'll want to look for areas with dense concentrations of pine trees. smart players will hide tents and vehicles within the trees themselves, ideally hidden from almost all directions. once again, ABUSE FREELOOK! 

* [heli crashes](http://southcoastbeanwars.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Crashed-Heli-Map-v7.jpg) are only spawned upon server restart - check this [arma2 server list](http://arma2.swec.se/server/list) to see if the server you're on has been restarted recently. within the first 30 minutes to an hour is the best time to go looking for them. if you already have a vehicle with decent offroad capabilities, assuming i've gassed up in krasnost. the map isn't 100% accurate, but it's close enough. note areas of highest concentration - around novy and stary sobor, vybor, and between gorka/polana. i've found around 2 dozen heli crashes in these this past week, with 3/4ths of them at these areas. 

* if you've found a heli crash and you're sure you're the first to get to it (it still has nvg's or other grab-on-sight gear) it may be beneficial to camp the crash, and a nearby place to stash your vehicle if you have one. the heli crash should be in enfilade from the heavy cover - meaning you should be looking at either the tail or the cockpit of the heli to minimize the amount of cover any other looters would have. [here's](http://i.imgur.com/KLjV7.jpg) a crappy diagram. in the diagram you are the blue x, the red x's are other players, and the grey sperm is the heli. the green turds around you are cover, preferably halfway up a hill overlooking the heli itself. if you have a sniper rifle, figure out the range beforehand so your first shot takes out a player right away. once you start shooting, you need to have eliminated everyone within 3 seconds or else you risk giving the enemy time to prepare a response. leave a couple of inconsequential guns around the crash (bizons or fn fals) or if you're really sadistic

**Misc Tips:**

* sniping positions - if you have the time, and where the blind spots are. if you ever need to take out a troublesome sniper, you'll know how to approach and where not to go. there are some good counter-sniping positions around elektro, cherno, zelenogorsk, stary, novy, and NWAF - you just have to find them. hint: they're usually in a lower position from the usual sniping spots

* thermal imaging does not go through unbroken windows! be warned

* audible range for other player's running footsteps at max volume (for me) is around 30 meters. test it out on your sound system

* download [the shooting range](http://www.armaholic.com/page.php?id=14616) for arma2 to practice your aim. when firing at a target, which is a waste of ammo. each gun has a different recoil pattern and effective range, and sometimes you can use this to your advantage. the m4a1/m4a1 cco pulls slightly up and to the right, and at 75m you can get a headshot on the second bullet in a 2-3 round burst if you aim at the target's left shoulder. little things like that can add up, and make a difference. 

* as much as possible don't mess too much with your FOV settings because it'll throw off the zeroing for sniper rifles! the dmr in particular is badly affected by this

that's it for now

1357752061.0,169a1v,The humanity system is seriously broken,fredwilsonn,312,75,184,"A few months ago

5 months later

The problem is that I am constantly distrusted by players. Heroes know that they don't lose humanity for killing me and they don't want to take a chance with me. I am being constantly punished for a mistake I made 5 months ago.

For me to restore my humanity

The system has to be changed to allow players to shift their humanity with a reasonable amount of effort. There should be a minimum amount of humanity to prevent situations like the one I had, bandit or otherwise.

Also losing humanity should not be based on the enemies humanity. It should be a flat rate like -750 per bandit kill

Humanity also needs to slowly crawl towards zero, 1 humanity every fifteen seconds. This forces heroes to maintain their image and forgives bandits over time.

I was being the good friend that I am and covering my friends from a sniper location as we made a run into starry sobor. I was at X location and could see all over the city and outside it. No zombies spawned or any players anywhere in sight. It was then once two of our guys made it into the tents did we then start to hear gunshots and one guy starts to bleed. I turn towards the direction of the shots origin and there I see it

As the zombies run towards him i see him suddenly disconnect

You should have straight up left the server however. As I sat.. and waited

You appeared right there and went prone immediately. From there I think you know the rest.. about 5 seconds later after i got my zeroing on

One problem. I'm Ghost. 




So I'm in the back of their car, and I get out. The passenger gets out and I manage to kill him. The other hits me in the leg but he only had a makarov, so I finished him off by breaking his legs with a few rounds. I then threw a flare and backed up as I watched zombies swarm his corpse.

So if I've missed your bad ass idea please let me know and I'll add it. But **please** keep it brief so it'll be easier to add.

Also

EDIT: If you think of something completely new because of this list

EDIT EDIT: Keep in mind each original suggestion was much more in depth with quite a bit of back and forth from the community (some really good ones too).....I'm just streamlining the idea for ease of reading.

- Barb wire should have a small % chance to cut you

- Buff the crossbow

- Less ammo 

- Less powerful guns

We live in Zel

Why do you people *insist* on constantly complaining about your lack of an ability to adapt? It's really getting super grating

Another thing is PVP. It's part of the game, you learn how to fight zombies pretty well. If I were chased by 20 zombies, and all I had was a 1911, I could take all of them and survive.

No that's not me trying to be a badass

If all we had to worry about was zombies, stop -hating- other people in -real life- for the role they want to play in the game.

From my experience and perspective, and meaningful.  I think people get angry about PVP in DayZ because they've never experienced PVP in a game where there was actually something to lose.  Back in the day MUDs were like that (multi-user dungeons, text based multiplayer games).  You'd build up your character, and get a bunch of gear, and then someone would kill you, but that was just the lay of the land. Rather than bitching and moaning about it like a little crybaby, you adapted

So please, and also a -game- and you shouldn't hate people for playing the game like its intended to be played because you refuse to adapt.

Noteworthy is the comparison between Counter-Strike and DayZ. Unlike the DayZ standalone, a year starts to look far less dramatic than some of the commentary would suggest.

**Original Post - 2/17**

I have been playing DayZ for a good while now

Now today the game is a highly shoot on sight type of game and I find myself getting tired of the game quickly. What I believe needs to happen is that the zombies need to be almost ridiculously strong and scary to counterbalance this shoot on sight gameplay. 

Currently no one is afraid to fire a gun because zombies are a joke. Firing a weapon in a city should be essentially a death wish. Think the first season of The Walking Dead with Rick in Atlanta. ~~Zombies should difficult to kill except by headshots or strong weapons (which should be hard to find at that).~~ *See Below* This means that if you are by yourself, but more than that and you pretty *have* to run.

I know to many it is backwards logic but if you make the environment over the top harsh

Imagine this: Two people meeting in the city but if either of them fires they will also die because of the environmental threat. Either you use a melee weapon or are forced to work together

**People bond and develop strong friendships out of times of hardship.** If you make the environment extremely,  but also thru working together in that harsh environment, you also ironically create a better chance for strong partnerships to form between individuals that at first might not.

---------

**Update 1 - 2/17 - Concerning Banditry**

My hopes are that the threshold level of difficulty would be enough that it mitigates the uselessness of killing new spawns and players with hardly anything because of a combination of zombie threat and ammo/supplies scarcity.

If anything, *it should also actually make banditry much more rewarding.*

Example for 'up-close' Banditry: In another post in this thread was mentioned about two player plus only actions. ~~I brought up an example of requiring two people and a crowbar to open a gun case in a police station.~~ *Retracted example - need better suggestions.* If you decide banditry is your thing, betray him and get away with it?

On the other hand as well, kill them, whatever, then they are likely to be just as much, *if not a better resource* as scavenging.

-----

**TL;DR for the suggestions within the comments**

1. *Obviously zombie glitchiness needs to be addressed first and foremost*, and pretty much everything else.
2. *Zombies don't necessarily need a damage boost but their numbers should be much greater.* This would address the idea of making shooting in a city a weighted decision
[Comment 1](http://www.reddit.com/r/dayz/comments/18pm56/rocket_the_zombies_need_to_be_over_the_top_scary/c8gvvyh) 
3. *Zombie numbers should be relative to the reasonable population size of the area.* If it's a city like cherno, high reward scenario. **Counterpoint:** Server incapability to support the sheer number of mobs? Something to be investigated.
4. I will leave my original suggestion in the post about about 'only headshots' for sake of continuity for later readers but I will *retract* my idea of it in light of another suggestion. *If the infection is fully defined* in what it does, that could lead to some better and more interesting gameplay mechanics as to how zombies take damage, their condition and ability to fight, how easy it is to kill them, etc. 
[Excellent Suggestion Comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/dayz/comments/18pm56/rocket_the_zombies_need_to_be_over_the_top_scary/c8gvox2) by [Nihilisst](http://www.reddit.com/user/Nihilisst)
5. *Zombies need to be more dimwitted.* They should not automatically know where a noise is coming from but start investigating in that direction when they hear it. This would make navigating infected cities with large mobs not impossible, a car or something of that nature.
[Comment 1
6. *Zombies shouldn't be able to run like a track star.* If anything, it doesn't make sense that a living infected/animated corpse/(insert your zombie versino) that only thinks about feeding on humans should still have the coordination and ability to do full bodied sprints. [Comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/dayz/comments/18pm56/rocket_the_zombies_need_to_be_over_the_top_scary/c8gycp3)
7. *Suicide should be an option.* And I don't mean just hitting the respawn button. Let's say I'm stuck in the city with one guy (that I don't like) and I feel like I want to take the easy way out and cap myself. However
8. *It should be harder to incur injuries.* Try to make someone bleed with just your hands. Or better yet, etc should be much less likely to occur. Getting attacked by zombies should in the first moments be more like a grappling situation where they grab you and slow you down perhaps. You should be able to knock them back and move a break away. Instead of taking blood damage, perhaps introduce a secondary value of fatigue. Running a lot in one go, being grabbed by a bunch of zombies, being shot (varying by the pentration location even) all should have varying levels of fatigue associated with them. As you become more fatigued, you have trouble running, climbing and performing any task. This means you have to evaluate your choices much more in just about everything.
9. *Going unconcious from being smacked by zombies should not happen.* Getting hit hard on the back of the head is the only melee related option that makes sense. Response to a post:

&gt; Unless you get very low on blood (which should be harder with the lessened bleeding chance), it should be very difficult to go unconscious. Wouldn't it be fantastic to be able to knock someone out from behind and take them hostage or use them as bait? It would open up so many options for alternate options of escape if I could knock out a guy, drag his body into the street and use him as bait to escape the other way. Morbid, but really would add depth.

**Update post on 2/18:**
This post has gotten a lot of feedback and I am doing my best to read and examine every comment and try to consolidate them together. I do not have any issues with rebuttals, amend and clarify some of the ideas in the above post to make it easy and neat for rocket and team to read thru the suggestions. Thanks everyone! 

**Current Question of the Day:** What are some ways we can create benefits for different playstyles but not create too strong of an advantage for them

-------

[I would also like to give attention to this post as well](http://www.reddit.com/r/dayz/comments/18pm56/rocket_the_zombies_need_to_be_over_the_top_scary/c8h8gmm) by [ervashi.](http://www.reddit.com/user/ervashi) Arguably

* Suggestion 1 - If slower and dimwitted
* Suggestion 2 - If faster and smarter
* Other Suggestions?

**Compromise Suggestion:** After reviewing many of the suggestions and ideas, but their damage lower to counterbalance their agility. Then for the ones more decayed, the slower they are but also the more infectious their damage would be, such as possibility of infecting the player. Basically you would have both types of zombies and the combination of the two together would create some interesting gameplay mechanics.

----

**2/19 Mini-Update**

Just looking at one of the suggestions that was debated a bit earlier. One possible solution for the solo vs team play balancing concerning the example of the ammo locker originally only openable by two people:

&gt; There should be options for solo players and teammates but there are pros and cons to each.
Say maybe there only spawns two good rifles and 2 mags each to keep it balanced.
Solo Pro: One primary for your person and your bag and decent amount of ammo. Con: A little more difficult to open on your own
Team Pro: Less risky and easier to open. Con: Have to split the ammo. If teaming up with a random person

At the moment the best option to survive is to run away and lose them.  Guns are only really used on other players (except pistols I guess).  The only time ive really hunted down and killed multiple zombies is when i'm dying of hunger looking for beans or when I have a shit load of gear and I'm bored.  

How about some incentive to actually kill zombies? With the new crafting system
doctor zombies drop rare surgical supplies?
mechanics drop rare vehicle repair items?

I think these items should be completely optional end game stuff though
