1351181555.0,122kop,"""What's been going on?"" - An Update",NeoDestiny,947,209,512,"So it seems kind of strange to fly all the way to Poland, or switch to a different game.

Over the course of the past few months, players) are completely out of touch, the community is confused and conflicted, and Blizzard is woefully inadequate.

After watching the game dwindle for quite some time, personally, to see some kind of growth. I thought about how people like Day9 and Husky bring people into the scene. I thought about the success of other games, like LoL and DotA 2, and what they're doing differently that could help us.

Then I thought about how I ever got into games.

I played Starcraft: Brood War for 10 years. I never played it ""seriously"" until the last year or so

Here was my routine -

1) /f all to see which friends are online. I can see in one glance who's in a game

   a) from here

   b) from here we could search for games together, we could watch a replay together. If he had a funny game he wanted to show me, we could literally make the game and watch it together while chatting and laughing about it.

2) if no one was really on

3) my favorite option, Town Square, clan x17, clan lzh, clan sphere, or clan OD, just to fuck with people.

I met so many people through those Brood War chats. I remember one chick I met via the chats, my favorite bands were Shine Down, Taking Back Sunday, A New Found Glory, and 311. I also listened to a fair bit of video game music. She told me to check out a couple of bands, Pain of Salvation and Riverside. After opening me up to the world of prog, I haven't looked back since. I kind of wonder if I hadn't had been exposed at that point to other types of music (beyond what's found on the radio or talked about in school) what my tastes in music would be like today.

I remember me + Frank (a mutual friend of me and Kyle) trolling this kid online so hard, saying stupid shit to his parents (whatever 15 year olds do) when they'd finally picked up the phone.

I remember when I was 17 years old and living with my grandma and I had no ride to school because my grandma didn't drive, but hey, I was able to get to school that day.

I played quite a few games when I was younger. I remember absolutely loving Halo when it came out (OMG VEHICLES? and PLZ that last level EPIC AS FUCK). I remember loving FFVII and FFIX and hating FFVIII (junction system fuck you) and always disagreeing with Kyle about it. I loved Ocarina of Time and I cringed at the time system in Majora's Mask, Brood War was a pretty central part of my life. I always found myself logging into Battle.net to hang out and chat with people.

When I compare all of these warm, and never will be, with the current system in place. Battle.net feels like a barren wasteland. We had to fight the developer just to get chat channels implemented, and even with them in it just doesn't feel right. There are so few lines of text that can fit, it's a pain in the ass to scroll up because any time someone hits enter the text resets, you're never even forced into a chat channel originally so you have the ability to never join one...It's just a mess. It feels absolutely terrible.

If I didn't play SC2 professionally, I still get assigned a rating for it.  So now, instead of fucking around and enjoying ourselves, I actually have friends that stress over winning team games? No way man, fuck that.

When I first came over to SC2, too, who also came over. We all were in the Beta, and it was going to be super awesome because we were going to practice hard and all be professional gamers together. Just like when we watched Flash and Jaedong and all of these other guys in the OSL; that was going to be us.

Every person that I knew couldn't stand the game for more than a month. Kyle doesn't play

This was **after** us being so incredibly hyped for this game that it was unbelievable. I remember sitting on AIM freaking out with a friend when SC2 was originally announced. My friend was fluent in Korean and was translating the Blizzard announcement as it was being broadcast live.

------------------------

I've talked about stuff like this so much, there's nothing wrong with it, and I had more fun in that time period than at any other period in my life. Falling asleep in class because I played one too many 2v2v2v2's, sleeping in and being late to school because I really wanted to master Wizard on Ramza so I spent an hour the previous night with him in a corner screaming until I'd had enough JP to learn everything, etc...etc...

I'm pretty far removed from that, and I know what it was like. So when I see all of these other people ""in the scene"" speak about what we need to do to ""grow the community"" and ""expand e-sports""...it just feels strange. It feels awkward, and alienating. It feels like I'm watching a politician on stage who's a multimillionaire saying ""I know what it's like to be poor! I know what it's like to be working 60 hours a week just to make the rent!""..and all I can think is, ""Man, fuck you, you don't know what it's like, stop feeding me that bullshit...""

Doa, or ""just have hope and everything will get better!""....man, battle.net sucks, it's **terrible**. SC2 was supposed to be **the flagship of e-sports**. When SC2 came out, the foreign scene actually got involved and exploded as a result. For the first time ever there was more money to be made in the foreign scene than in Korea for Starcraft. If you'd had told anyone that 5 years ago, they'd have said it was impossible, that Korea will always be the mecca of Starcraft. Although that holds some truth today

You don't understand how angry it makes me...I've talked about it on stream before, but they'll backstab you for their corporate lobbyists in a split second. Obama talks about unprecedented transparency and how the Democrats hate the Republicans for their wars and fear-mongering, yet the Patriot Act gets bipartisan support for re-approval for Congress. The Democrats have always been opposed to huge businesses getting government tax breaks, yet there was bipartisan support for the $700billion in bailout money...that all went to huge businesses. Why would a party that historically stands for ""the working man"" and ""against big business"" subsidize all of their losses with our tax money???

Sorry, we can't rely on them for anything, we just have to do what we can now for the scene."" What the fuck, you're ready to throw in the towel, then? Battle.net will always be a barren wasteland?

Or Geoff's ""The scene's doing fine, shape or form?

""You don't want to be part of this money grab, the only real answer is to just ""fuck off"" to a different game? Is that what you would tell every single fan who's tired of SC2 because the game offers nothing for the non-competitive person?

I may say some mean things, and I love including as many people into things as possible. That's the reason why I'm the most visible person on forums like screddit and teamliquid, despite the haters/trolls. It's the reason why I make an effort to remain visible at public events and to stay and sign every single thing a person brings me, or talk to every single fan that wants a word. It's why I talk to and interact with my chat as much as possible. It's why I respond to **every** e-mail that's sent to me. It's why I've read almost every word said about me online, whether it's on screddit, teamliquid, or my youtube channel.

If we owe our livelihoods to the community

---------------------

**So what now?**

I'm not sure. I had the misfortune of speaking to a Blizzard rep, that's going to give JP some ""sick information"". I'm pretty sure that I already know what information he's going to give him, and I know how the community will react. At first everyone will say it's pretty neat, because it gives players an incentive to play some more, but it's all still focused around ""being competitive"". After hearing him tell me about some of the problems that Blizzard has when dealing with some issues, I was 100% certain that nothing was going to change.

Nothing significant will change with the Battle.net interface. I've been so torn over the past few weeks whether or not I should just dump the chatlog on screddit and peace the fuck out (which is what most of you would do if you honestly saw it)

I thought about transferring to something else in SC2

So if that's a no-go, making it the obvious choice to transfer to.

I'm not 100% switching yet; it's impossible right now for me to do it. My heart is still with SC2; I've put so much time into anything in my entire life. My marriage failed because I was too busy juggling work and school, and then I even managed to lose that. SC2 is the only thing that I've been reasonably successful in, and the thought of all of the time I've put into it essentially being wasted by switching games destroys me. It's frustrating enough being ""bad"" at SC2, where I'm in the top .1% of players around the world, but to be ""bad"" in a game where I'm barely in the top 30-40% of players? It's absolutely excruciating, I almost can't even bring myself to stream the learning process and the growing pains that happen along the way.

-------------------------

This has been the most disorganized rambling of thoughts I've ever posted before. I thought about organizing this into a coherent something that I could post on the main screddit to try and get people united behind some changes for SC2, so all of the white noise would lead to nothing constructive getting done that increases the actual player base in the game.

I don't know what I'm planning on doing for the future, and thanks for supporting me by watching my stream. I promise that when I know something concretely I'll let you all know.

- What about Dota 2?!

No, stop posting your 15 page diatribes about it, I know it might be better/you love Valve/etc...etc...etc...And all of those reasons are great and right and valid, but please, you're wasting your time explaining away all of these things to me. I've heard them a million times before, I swear!

- Are you ever going to play SC2 again?!

I'm thinking about trying to balance my time where I play several hours of SC2 a day and several hours of LoL a day

I've thought about doing some different things with SC2, team games vs comps, etc...etc...), and racking up 'dem points does have some appeal to me. I know trolling lower league games is exciting for viewers, but I can only do that for a game or two before it drives me crazy.  I could also just go back to grinding the ladder, but I'm not sure how I feel about doing that only playing so many hours a day. I could also move into a purely informative category. Regardless of my assholeishness/etc.. I think I do have a penchant for teaching, so I could try to publish strategy guides or build orders and do videos and such on that (something along the lines of what Day9 does

Any ideas here? I'd be interested in hearing them.

- Other ideas

I've thought about doing a ""Let's Play"" series on my Youtube where I run through different games and compile the entire playthrough on my Youtube into playlists for different games. Is there any interest in something like this? The only qualifications for this is that I'd almost always be using a walkthrough and I'd be insanely anal about getting everything. I'm about halfway through FFVI and can't find myself finishing it now because I checked a guide and realized I've already missed some shit that I won't be able to get again. ._.

Everything so far has been playing out pretty much exactly as I planned it would. The switch to Twitch.TV was good, and my average viewership has popped up quite a bit.

Towards the end of my SC2-ness, it seems my viewership would peak at around 3-3.5k, if I was lucky. If I was just grinding and not talking much, it'd be around 1.2-1.6k.

Playing LoL now, which is a significant improvement (pretty much doubling or tripling my previous income).

A few things to note:

1) I'm still not at a level of skill in LoL as compared to where I was in SC2. In SC2 Masters league is considered to be ~top 4.5%

2) One thing that I'm kind of happy of is that I didn't really have to use any of my relationships with other streamers as leverage for getting a foothold in the LoL streaming community. The lessons with doublelift were fun, so to speak, if I couldn't gain viewers on my own, but I gained viewer so quickly that I didn't have to resort to that, which is good.

3) Website is finally coming along, Ceneza).

4) The vitriol from SC2 kids that come into my chat or post on r/sc about how much better their game is etc...etc...than any other game is insanely fucking toxic

Anyway, but now she lives in [Virginia,](http://i.imgur.com/awvGAEq), though he didn't know the name of the city, or even what part of the state it was in. It took him a couple of minutes to magically find the city on google maps and send it to Destiny on skype.

So after establishing that she definitely exhists

Finally

Thankfully

But something was nagging in the back of my head. I knew I had heard XJ9's story before

It's such a genius ploy. He figures that people who watch league of legends wouldn't also follow college football

But I'm on to him, the future doesn't bode well for XJ9's girlfriend. Expect the front page to look something like [THIS](http://i.imgur.com/2UIa10w) in a couple of weeks.

Here's the link of who Manti Te'o is and what he did for those of you who would have fallen for XJ9's plot:

I woke up in the mid-afternoon a few days ago, I decided to check Reddit. I saw you had posted in your subreddit with an update, which I read. You detailed your loss of passion for SC2, how you gave up music and your job at the casino, a job you had previously decided to rely on after leaving school. Being pressed for time, I hurriedly threw myself together and got in my car to drive to the restaurant, where I bus tables.

While I was listening to music, having written more pages than I can remember over that time, from love poetry to short stories featuring a serial killer protagonist. While I still consider myself highly skilled, the realization overwhelmed me so quickly that I almost felt panicked, as a person would feel when seeing a spider.

I will never be a published writer. I have spent the past 10 years perfecting a talent that has amounted to little more than a conversation piece, my future became uncertain, muddled by the daily happenings of my current life, and I wasn't able to hold onto anything. The only thing I ever held onto disappeared. I am not in school. I do not have a girlfriend anymore. My brother just recently had a mental collapse, resulting in severely damaged sanity. After having grown throughout my years, being praised for my artistic brilliance, my resounding academic success, it became clear that I could not achieve what I slaved to achieve

I say all this because I want you to know that I understand what you must be feeling. I'd imagine that it is similar in some way. But please know

I did not become a fan because of the four brofestor hit squad.

I did not become a fan because of the baneling analogy.

I did not become a fan because of the camfields.

I became a fan because I relate to you. I became a fan because you do not mince words. I became a fan because you are a real person. When I watch your stream, of your sponsors, of your hard-earned success. You are not afraid almost to a fault. You are a normal person, with a vibrant personality.

While SC2 is my favorite game and I hope your passion for it is one day revived, not Destiny the SC2 player. Whatever you pursue, I know you will find success. If you need more encouragement, I am sure the many other people in this subreddit share my sentiment. Thank you for being you. Good luck.

Sincerely

Daniel",self,t5_2qnvz,1351512669.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/Destiny/comments/1297jk/destiny_in_response_to_your_whats_been_going_on/

Please don't waste time suggesting stupid shit etc...I know we all love to troll

- I want accounts to be tied in with the accounts on my website. If someone is subscribed to me via my website

- I want there to be different ""user levels"", say, ""VIPs"" like people who are famous like Vman or Fatefalls or whatever, and ""Subscribers"" for subs, ""Admins"" for admins like me or Nathan (in case he wants to mod hehehe), ""Moderators"" etc...pretty simple, so basically the idea to create different classes of issues recognized by the chat

- Would be nice to have different rooms

- Would be nice to have the ability to PM/whisper someone. I feel like this feature is desperately lacking in the current chat system

- Would be nice to make aliases or what not for people to type in to have a symbol come out (ie: Kappa

- Would be nice to give flair to account names (ie for subs and what not)

- Ability for people to select the color of their username

- Windows ""freezes"" when you scroll; chat will no longer scroll while you have the bar at any position besides the bottom of the window

- Ability to set how many lines you wish to have loaded of the chat at once (can have it so it only stores 10, 10,000 lines)

- Website will log all text

- Ability to ignore/highlight the chat from users if you wish

- If someone mentions a user

- Ability to filter text

- ""Always on top"" setting so chat will sit on top of full screened stream

- Bookmarking of current VOD so you can come back and watch later

- Polls in chat

- Chat metrics!

- Ability to play back chat with VOD?

- Friends list

- An FAQ Bot. Make a Bot that will immidiatley answer frequently asked questions like ""What leauge is this guy?"" ""Whats the song?""

He already knows how most champs work (or at least has a general understanding of what they do) so that wouldn't be much of an issue, but he would likely see a rise in viewership from playing a more ""exciting"" role and he would enjoy playing the game more in general. I notice one thing he complains a lot about is his top/mid lane die a lot but if were to switch to be a jungle main or a mid main he could literally win other people's lanes for them if they fall behind.

Im not sure about this but I think midlane players average more viewers as well. Xpeke, Froggen, Ocelote usually have much more viewers than Robertxlee, hiimgosu, cop etc. Turtle seems to be one of the only ones with a really high viewership as an adc. This probably has to do more with personality than role though, I have no idea, but its just something I've noticed.

I would love to hear you guys(and Destiny's) opinion on this. Would you guys like to see Destiny play some more mid champions as well or do you rather see him play adc?

Tier 1 subscribers - It's $5/month (with $2 being billed every 3 months, and you get to talk when I'm in rage-mode and I put the subs only mode on. + I'll unban you if I rage ban you (RIP Dogspound or whatever sub I temp-banned yesterday).

Tier 2 subs are priced X2 of the previous entry. These are the subs that I'll enter into drawings and shit for the weekly ARAMs (HOLY FUCK). Every Sunday I'll put aside some time (still debating how much) to play ARAMs or normals with my tier 2 subs. I could probably do other stuff

First of all, but I still followed you there. Shame on them for not paying you (if that is the correct reason).

So anyway, but I have always had your stream on in the background while I do homework and browse the internet. Whether you play LoL or SC2 doesn't mater much to me. But what does matter, is hearing and seeing Destiny having fun.

I don't speak for anyone else

So to get the point. I feel like it would be a better experience for both you and your fans if instead of being a competitive gamer focusing on LoL

Now why would you want to stop focusing on being the best you can at LoL? I know you are a naturally competitive person, a brand, is extremely difficult but extremely rewarding. 

Try to think of the biggest variety gaming personality, a second opinion, for all the fans TB has, he also has many to dissent and don't care for him. 

This is is all half assed when it comes to explaining the reasoning, I think your personally lends itself to something better than focusing on 1 game. I will still turn on your stream and watch you play LoL, but I think it would be beneficial to your pocketbook and your sanity to just go and have fun.

How to catch axes: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uf-t2iNIvM4

Skill Order: R &gt; Q &gt; W &gt; E. 

Levels: lvl 1: Q, lvl 4: E

Catching axes will refresh his W!!!! 

Draven can spam his W all the time in fights for the steroid and if you want to chase after someone. It is basically impossible to run away from Draven

TL;DR: The true power of Draven comes from his W.

Because damnit I like LoL...  I like watching you play LoL...  I even love it when you rage... ON FUCKING LINE.  Where they can't ban you.

How NOT to get reported and banned...  This is what this is about.   There are of course a great many things that can get you reported and banned... But I""m going to address the ones that are

Now I'm a top 250 judge.  Which is a bullshit title really but out of the 1.8k cases done these are no bullshit.

**First rule:**

Never

Never

**Second rule:**

Never...  Absolutely never use racial or sexual orientation slurs.  These are insta punish votes in the tribunal.

Nigger

It's also not a great idea to use sexual organ slurs.  Pussy

**Third Rule**:

Don't tell someone they are bad.  I don't give a shit if they are bad.  Don't say they are feeders, retards, or anything derogatory and hang on it all game... Hell... If your name is the only one on 8 lines of text to become a ""block"" of negativity...  Chances are you fucked.  DON'T FUCKING DO THAT.

**In general**

The tribunal judges really only do one thing.  They look to see if what you are saying was *trying* to piss off someone.   Cussing doesn't get you banned. As long as you aren't spamming fuck, or whatever...  Nobody really cares.  Or at least the majority of judges don't care.

dear steve

i left my twitter and my sc2 handle at the bottom

sometimes i make typos when i'm blazing pot &amp; real numb

but anyways, how fed's nathan?

my girlfriend don't exist

if i have a daughter

i read about your LoL ranking too

i had a friend ragequit over some bitch who couldn't support him

i know you probably hear this every day

i even got your T2 sub

i got a room full of your may-may's and your pictures

i like the shit you did with minigun

anyways

just to chat, pls #callcatz

&gt;EDIT: Here's the last verse from ""Stan's"" perspective (I like the idea of it being from falcontard). I might do the the final verse as well

dear mr. ""I'm-too-good-to-play-a-dying-game""

this'll be the last time i ever watch your stream

it's been a day and still no word

i know you got my last email and marked it ""read""; i hacked your shit

so this is my screencast i'm sending you

i'm in a basement

hey steve

you know the song by eminem about a guy named stan?

about how marshall coulda saved his biggest fan from drowning

but didn't

that's kinda how this is

plus it's too late

and all i wanted was a coaching session or a call

i hope you know i ripped all of your may-may's off the wall

i loved you steve

you ruined it now

and when you feed

i hope your ELO eats at you and you can't breathe without me

see steve

hey steve

but i didn't ask her out, i ain't like you

cause if she'd answered ""no"" i'd suffer more and pro'bly cry too

well

People like Diamond and Sasquatch (both known well in the SC2 community) discuss the topic and don't seem to hesitate suggesting it is him

~~2) Stream unmutes itself after commercial (comment: *very very serious issue

3) Own3d needs a mobile app.


**medium:**

1) No resolution options on VODs (comment: *will be added in q1 2012 according to oleg: [link](http://www.reddit.com/r/Destiny/comments/mzqkn/lets_organize_complaints_so_that_destiny_knows/c355lbp)*)

~~2) No 240p option on live stream.~~ Added according to oleg: [link](http://www.reddit.com/r/Destiny/comments/mzqkn/lets_organize_complaints_so_that_destiny_knows/c355lbp)

3) Default chat is pretty horrible. 

4) Muted stream auto-unmutes after a commercial


**minor:** 

1) Horizontal volume control is better than vertical. (comment: *i don't think there is any media player that has it vertical by default. Even youtube tried vertical for a while. Horizontal is simply better.*)

2) Fading UI on non-fullscreen mode is annoying (comment: *it's nice for exactly 10 minutes

3) Volume resets at ~20% everytime you refresh a stream.

What were Destiny's viewer counts during the ""peak"" of his SC2 phase and what are they now? I know numbers don't necessarily mean much, promise this isn't a troll post and I'm not trying to incite anything, but I'm interested because it seems like a common argument I see in the Twitch chat is that Destiny started playing LoL because he gets more viewers (again, not necessarily true, just something that's said often.) Maybe it's just the nature of the communities, but from a purely anecdotal perspective it seems like Destiny was more ""popular"" in general with the SC2 community than he is with the LoL community. I rarely see him mentioned in r/leagueoflegends where as in r/starcraft he was a pretty frequent topic of discussion. 




I know there are a TON of factors at play, the age of the communities and the games, as well as other things like Destiny streaming on OWN3D and stuff, but to me it seems like he was much better known in the Starcraft community and had a better chance of ""making it"" there (whatever that means.)

v7.0.1's code with many sensitive parts removed: http://pastebin.com/jwPAUVpS

When it expires in 30 days

I don't code for clarity, no one else was really intended to read the code, hence the lack of comments and use of fantastically long lines like

    message(""No song played/scrobbled. Played "" + tdformat(int((datetime.datetime.utcnow() - datetime.datetime.strptime(psong[0].playback_date

Why do I code like this? My reasoning is that when I'm done with a line of code, while I'm scrolling through lines of code, I shouldn't have to scroll past 10 lines of perfectly functional code when I can shove it all into 1 line.

The Story of Steven and Irishladdie

By: Philip K. Dickhead

Chapter 1:

It was some time after the formation of the Pan-American Fempire^1 that Steven found what appeared to be a vagrant at his doorstep. The bedraggled man stood before Steven with disheveled hair and worn clothing. The bags under his eyes seemed to suggest that he had not slept recently and repugnant odor that hung about his clothes made it apparent that if he had

Somehow

Steven stepped out of his house letting the screen door swing shut behind him. Autumn leaves rustled gently in the breeze, swinging a hammer downward at an anvil labeled “Patriarchy” as the women said, “Ours shall be the blow that strikes at oppression!” Somewhere in the distance a stray dogs barked incessantly. 

“Can I help you?” Steven asked with measured hesitation. 

“God, “I expect you can’t recognize me like this. I’m Irishladdie. We used to converse while you were streaming.” 

“Really?” said Steven, a liberal arts degree in women's studies was just as useless^2 under the new regime as it had been previously, leaving Irishladdie without employment. 

Life was not easy for Steven either. Living under the iron grip of the Fempire’s unshaven vulva was expensive for white, Steven could not but help take pity on the poor man and invited Irishladdie into his home. 

The Fempire had come to power by promising to elevate those individuals who had felt disenfranchised under previous governments. All that it had actually managed to do was to reduce everyone to that level. They were all equals now

The world had decayed to the point that as Steven invited Irish into his home and went to kitchen to get him a meal, who had burned down an entire orphanage, killing over fifty newborn infants, would have shocked Steven at one point, but such news no longer fazed him; at least not since they had convicted him of killing his ex-wife.

Steven would have mused further on the sordid state of affairs

Steven brought the reheated leftovers into the living room, Irishladdie returned the plate to Steven, who brought it back to the kitchen. As he placed it into the sink, he heard the familiar sound of the screen slamming shut, announcing the arrival of his son, Nathan. 

“How was school today, greeting his son. 

“Bad

Steven mussed his son’s hair as he embraced him. “Don’t worry about that too much

“Okay, “Dad what’s a rapist? Jenny told me that she learned that all boys were rapists.”

Steven sighed. How could he even begin explaining rape to a young child who still had no real interest in or understanding of sex? “It’s nothing

“What are they teaching in schools these days?” he wondered aloud as Nathan ran off.  

“Obviously important facts, and other—“ he continued, but Steven had already stopped listening as he wondered just what he had gotten himself into and how long he would be able to bear it. 

---

1 Although the official dictionary entry for the Fempire defined it as a combination of the words female (although it was not spelled that way in order to avoid triggering those individuals who had suffered under the Patriarchy.) and empire

2 It was quite useless as the particular paper and inks used made it unsuitable for use as bathroom tissue and almost impossible to burn. No one had yet thought to try eating it

I started to select the best songs of my music collection and put them into a spotify playlist a few weeks ago. Sadly many artists aren't yet available on Spotify

Every Artist is unique in this playlist (besides 2 or 3 tracks

The playlist doesn't include the progressive, Emery etc.) - which I, by the way, also like, but I wanted to keep the character of the playlist. 
I'd guess that 50% of it are japanese Artists/Bands.
     
   
**Here is the link:**

And the direct Spotify Link:
spotify:user:xneogenicx:playlist:0oDQFqrU7G5jwbfEV3suqo


   
   
For those of you who don't have Spotify (or it isn't available in your country):  
Sadly I have no alternative version of this Playlist. Maybe in the future I'll try to make a YouTube Playlist out of it.
Grooveshark is impossible for me due to it being blocked in Germany. It would be awesome if someone could copy the playlist to grooveshark


   
‍‍For those without Spotify here are some randomly selected tracks from the Playlist:​​

1364059077.0,1av7mp,Isnt Destiny kinda shooting himself in the foot with this joke of schedule?,HellNova,71,42,49,"Incase you don’t know what I’m talking about: http://www.destiny.gg/schedule

My problems with the schedule:

1)	He doesn’t start streaming when the schedule says he will.

2)	He does not always switch to HotS (ex. the other day because his ‘jimmies were rustled’) 

3)	Sometimes (yesterday) he did not start streaming games at all till night because he wanted to build that computer. (Which he could have waited a day to do because on Saturday he didn’t have any scheduled things to do.)


Now I know I sound really mad right?  Not really.  I didn’t mind it at all before when it was just random streaming times and he would switch games whenever.  

The problem now is that it is still the EXACT same way


Its also very annoying sticking around till the scheduled HotS times just to have him announce 5 minutes before (or not at all) that he had no plans to actually follow the schedule. (which has happened the last two nights) #HowMadAreYouRightNow?

Suggestions?

-Obviously the first suggestion would be to actually follow the schedule

-ReName it to 'an EXTREMLY loose guideline' which is just for your own personal motivation and not for any actual streaming times. 

-Edit the schedule on the fly when you know you won’t have time / don’t want to play a certain game.  

-tell your stream viewers/twitter followers preferably before the scheduled times that you will not be doing it today so they do not wait around expecting you to do it.  Its no surprise that 'HotS now?' explodes in the twitch chat even on days where he decided he will not play it

Now, myself included, would now put no faith in any type of schedule/plan that he would release.  If people aren’t putting stock in announcements he has then, from a business standpoint he is losing viewers that got annoyed and don’t BELIEVE, or even potential viewers, that see this schedule, stick around

1376604701.0,1kg5eu,Destiny: An easy way to fix the video click issue on Destiny.gg,trpcicm,24,2,18,"A while back (maybe a week ago)
  
  
**Step 1: Add HTML**  
In the HTML for your site, add a new div like so:

    &lt;div id=""twitch-elements"" class=""clearfix""&gt;
        &lt;div id=""twitch-overlay""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;div id=""twitch-player"" class=""twitch-element-wrap pull-left""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;div id=""twitch-chat"" class=""twitch-element-wrap pull-left""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

**Step 2: Add CSS**  
Somewhere in your CSS

    #twitch-overlay {
        position: absolute;
        top:0; left: 0;
        height: 447px;
        width: 795px;
    }

**Step 3: Javascript (Optional)**  
Now

    $(""#twitch-overlay"").on(""click""
        // Do something here!
    });

This step is totally optional, then clicking on the video will simply do nothing.  
  
&amp;nbsp;  
  
So, well, everything).  If you need more details, PM me and I'll lend a hand.  

&amp;nbsp;  

**Edit:** Destiny saw this, because the video and controls are part of the same DOM element (an `&lt;object&gt;` tag), there's no way to directly apply any code to just one part of the player.  The only way is to add an external component, and the `&lt;div&gt;` overlay I used above is the most lightweight solution.  I used Chrome Dev Tools to modify his page while his stream was running, and it worked perfectly.

About two years ago my life was pretty ruff and love towards StarCraft was practically it's only highlight. I was leaving house around 6:00AM, staying late to finish up all of my project at the ad agency, came back to my empty studio apartment around 10-11PM to study, make research, code and write papers - sadly, no time for SC. I don't remember how, but around that time I've stumbled upon Steven's stream (Livestream/Ustream times). I've immediately felt a connection with this guy, came back home and indulged in zerg infestation. Time difference between US and Europe was timed nearly perfectly

–– Time passed

I'm back in school, I'm writing a paper and have to get to work in 5 hours. This gave me an idea to revisit Destiny's old streams and bring back some good memories. Sadly, Ustream streaming is very choppy on my current connection, so I've wrote a script to retrieve .flv links and download them on my HDD. If you'd like to do the same, all the links are listed below. GLHF!

**TL;DR:** Destiny helped me survive some hectic times. Thanks bro

1364097489.0,1awc19,Fuck Irishladdie,brian9107,56,34,51,"One of my sources just forwarded me a copy of a rather intriguing document about Irishladdie. In the remainder of this letter, is Irishladdie hoping that the readers of this letter won't see the weakness of his argument relative to mine? Irishladdie doesn't want you to know the answer to that question; he wants to ensure you don't pave the way for people of every sex

Irishladdie's supporters remain largely silent when asked about the correlative connecting Irishladdie to Jacobinism. The rare times they do deign to comment they invariably skew the issue to prevent people from realizing that you should check out some of the things Irishladdie is saying about Comstockism. The litany of inaccuracies, and downright falsehoods will shock you. And I won't even bother mentioning that the main dissensus between me and Irishladdie is that I assert that there is not much demand for independent thinkers in Irishladdie's retinue. He, on the other hand, contends that ebola, AIDS, mad-cow disease, and the hantavirus were intentionally bioengineered by offensive

I have seen what Irishladdie is capable of, physical movement, and privacy rights. And I must agree; one needs much more evidence than that. But the evidence is there for anyone who isn't afraid to look at it. Just look at the way that his premise (that his malisons are good for the environment, human rights, and baby seals) is his morality disguised as pretended neutrality. Irishladdie uses this disguised morality to support his annunciations, thereby making his argument self-refuting.

If Irishladdie's attempts to bring widespread death and degradation to millions of human beings across the face of the Earth have spurred us to establish a supportive—rather than an intimidating—atmosphere for offering public comment, and the unloosing of a wrongheaded bloodlust. It is, in every sense, an ophidian and pagan religion that incites its worshippers to an orgulous frenzy and then prompts them to scrap the notion of national sovereignty. Irishladdie frequently accuses his adversaries of causing this country to flounder on the shoals of self-interest, corruption, and chaos. This is yet another example of the growing lack of civility in our civil discourse that ranges from the undiplomatic to the unprincipled and even yellow-bellied. In a more proper debate, one would instead politely point out that my goal is to tackle the multinational death machine that Irishladdie is currently constructing. I might not be successful at achieving that goal

Irishladdie possesses no significant intellectual skills whatsoever and has no interest in erudition. Heck, in a totally emotional and non-rational way, to his deep-rooted love of Mohockism. However, that's not my entire message; it's only a part of it. I also want you to know that there is historical precedent for Irishladdie's stratagems. Specifically, for as far back as I can remember, he has been going to great lengths to conceal his true aims and mislead the public. Given how one stentorian activity always leads to another, it should come as no surprise that Irishladdie yields to the mammalian desire to assert individuality by attracting attention. Unfortunately, ""attracting attention"" usually implies ""creating a regime of condescending

Sometimes it has seemed to me that I could discern something holy, I discovered that this sadness stems solely from the doleful observation that Irishladdie is like a pigeon. Pigeons are too self-absorbed to care about anyone else. They poo on people they don't like; they poo on people they don't even know. The only real difference between Irishladdie and a pigeon is that Irishladdie intends to trivialize the issue. That's why I am not fooled by Irishladdie's biased and eristic rhetoric. I therefore gladly accept the responsibility of notifying others that I've heard of sanguinolent things like Dadaism and serfism. But I've also heard of things like nonviolence, higher moralities, and treating all beings as ends in and of themselves—ideas that Irishladdie's ignorant, unthinking, doolally brain is too small to understand.

Knowledge and wisdom are Irishladdie's enemies. He understands that by limiting education and enlightenment, however, when one considers that he doesn't want us to dole out acerbic criticism of Irishladdie and his phalanx of self-aggrandizing goombahs. He would rather we settle for the meatless bone of poststructuralism.

I must ask that Irishladdie's foot soldiers solve our problems over a negotiating table instead of resorting to the battlefield. I know they'll never do that so here's an alternate proposal: They should, I recommend that he teach them about love, trust, cooperation, community, reason, negotiation, paranoia

Although I respect Irishladdie's right to free speech just as I respect it for abominable cumber-grounds, bad-tempered gutter-dwellers, he should start developing the parts of his brain that have been impaired by Bourbonism. At least then he'll stop trying to depressurize the frail vessel of human hopes. I could accept, perhaps, press releases backed by the forces of logic and powerful reasoning. Orations marked with hypocrisy and contradiction, however, merit none of my respect. Today, oppressed masses. Tomorrow, is in the eye of the beholder, I avouch

Imagine if Irishladdie and his oligophrenic associates all tried to one-up each other in a snarky match to see who could use the most disaffected, however, tend to agree that counterproductive, indelicate present-day robber barons commonly succumb to Irishladdie's distortions, deceptions, and delusions. I do not. Rather, I take pride in looking into the future and considering what will happen if we let Irishladdie fracture family unity.

A lot of people are disgruntled with your *unofficial* switch from SC2 to LoL, or the hilarious BM, or the many things that made Destiny playing SC2 worth watching, but there are a lot of things that people enjoy that aren't mutually exclusive to SC2.


Personally, the combatex parts, your whole series of videos on language was very entertaining, you playing Day Z, crysis etc. All these things don't have to change.

I would very much appreciate seeing all these entertaining things on your stream once again. people believe that because you've quit SC2 you've quit all those things aswell

People who watch your stream, or DayZ etc, but they all like watching Destiny. I find your opinion interesting, and even more interesting the way that you manage to convey it. It made me respect you, it made me want to watch you more.

A good example of this is the Destiny Q&amp;A series. I very much enjoy it

very  small change for me

maybe in his description on twitch he could link his main site*(as im sure he does) but don't be afraid to mention that shit

 I also thought that you should hype up your services a bit more: You mentioned you would build rigs for people..( I bet you would be surprised at how much people would pay to see you do random shit)..

maybe you can get some raffles going on or some shit too.  it would drive up your popularity maybe.. try to market yourself with free giveaways you get from sponsors.. you dont need the extra shit anyway.

*When you click on Twitch.tv and you look at LoL vs Sc2, there are also many more channels competing for those viewers.  Click on LoL and look at the individual streams.  It is not very often that you will see 1 single stream (with the exception of tournaments) that has over 3k viewers.  

*As of the time I am typing this

*On Ow3nd HotshotGG has 5k

*With the exception of a few people in LoL (the same can be said about Sc2 with Day9, a lot of the streams have only 500 people.  The difference between LoL and Sc2 is LoL = 300+ streams where SC2 has 90+ streams.  

*So even though LoL is getting more viewers

In order for Destiny to get more viewers than the top players in LoL, than fine.  Do it, if it's what you want to do.  However, please stop making up numbers to try and justify why you are doing this, when the math just does not add up to your statements.

Behold: price analysis based on play/winrates
http://i.imgur.com/g0v2OXS.jpg

Then
http://i.imgur.com/jxuadgh.jpg

This was still limited to 1 swap per 3 games but you could at least save/gain the points every few games.

Then Ceneza put in the multiplier and fixed cheated and nothing became important except play rate and role.


Heres the best strategy now:

The highest playrate of each champ in each role.

http://imgur.com/KWQI75Z 

Add in the Hafu (Zyra) Destiny(Draven) factor and the team becomes a lot more clear. 

Zyra, Lux.  

Nasus was an ok 5th choice because he is +/- 3% most popular jungledude and could also be top since Hafu plays amumu and xin sometimes. He also only cost 50 points to xin/jarvans infinite.


Overall its a lot more boring. Theres not much thought. Even with Draven getting a huge cut in points due to his play rate

How to make it better? Make the correct champion choice much less obvious

http://i.imgur.com/IQ9To1r.gif

I think some gradient in champion #worth based on their initial cost should definitely exist. Its fun to progress to a stronger and stronger team as the season goes on. Just make sure da picks don't feel random. 

It would probably be best if u just made it like a real fantasy league. Average out all champions stats over a day/week. Reward points at end of day/week based on performance. Take into account win/loss

 To put in an artificial champion #worth gradiant instead of just having it be a crapshoot

Shitty examples:

Nasus +1 points per tower killed

Draven +1 points per boots purchased

Zyra +2 points per double kill

Its pretty easy to get a general estimate of the worth of these and use it to increase/decrease initial cost of champions.

**TLDR; DO BETTER IF U EXPECT PPL TO GIVE A SHIT

On that fateful day when Destiny rededicated his stream to LoL, then I would wish him the best of luck. However, when I check his stream on teamliquid, at least when he's actually playing (not building a computer, etc.) he rarely rises above 3000 viewers. Wasn't 3000+ viewers the AVERAGE amount of viewers when he was streaming SC2, as long as big names like IdrA weren't also streaming? He had explained at one point (anyone have the link?) that, if he continued with SC2, whereas switching to LoL would eventually increase monthly stream revenue over time. Correct me if I'm wrong

You were right to say that making loans easier would incent students overextend their loans. But, but it shouldn't push students fees up.

Your worries [that something similar to the mortgage crises might happen] are legit. If the vision we had on how the market would be by the time the borrower graduated

The only way for them to not end up in this situation is to study hard

""The keyboard sucks balls. I would never



I am not sure when he says ""Just get normal dome switches"" if he means overall there's no point in MX switches or when it comes to black switches you might as well get dome switches.



**TL;DR**


My questions are: 

-What made him decide to use black switches?

-If he does not like black switches

-Are blue switches still his most preferred?

-Despite your arguably valid insight on the future of sc2



(I'm sorry if this post is a little trivial or these questions have been answered before. These past couple of months I haven't watching the stream as much as I usually do due to the schools and life stuffs.)
