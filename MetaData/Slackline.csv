1370532872.0,1fsn7h,Such a great little resource you have here,zumzumzum,23,3,25,"I was introduced to slacklining by a friend of mine at the climbing gym in town. Without him I don't think I'd ever have had the bravery to try the thing out on my own. (Now even when I go on my own I'm acting a fool on it) I can't balance for crap but I try to spend some time on it every time I go. I feel like once I have my own I can get competent on it much

I finally took the plunge and ordered one yesterday, that it'd fall apart sooner than it should, etc, but I ordered it anyway. Something about it just didn't sit right with me. After I ordered I was so, so lucky to find /r/slackline and the sidebar guides quickly led me to confidence in building a primitive setup. I canceled my order on Amazon immediately and now I'm waiting on my [standard kit](http://i.imgur.com/co63fWs.png) from REI. At first I was looking at the kit images people posted on here and scratched my head. I couldn't figure out how you could make it work. The ingenious rigging method used, is to me is so satisfying, so much more than the ratchets.

I'm sure these posts come up all the time, so thank you.

As a small gift

Next up on the video project list (as school and weather allow) will be a guide to softpointing (covering 5 different techniques)

Lastly, and when some of those people click the links that means an occasional advertising revenue check from google for me — which allows me to buy gear that I can destroy in break tests or otherwise do something cool with on video, so I decided it made sense to enable the ads by default on most of my videos.  People clicking the ads doesn't mean a LOT of revenue (sadly I don't think I get any if they just watch an ad, haha), but it does mean a bit, and that buys some gear, so hopefully y'all don't find the ads too annoying.

I'm also going to Thailand next month so It will be an awesome toy to take to the beach!

I'm looking forward to being part of this community here on Reddit. One thing I liked so much about doing it yesterday was just how nice the people were that do it.

Since I got him to write up that AMA

He is a very very new redditor, made the verification post, then stopped following it. Then last night, I get a txt from him asking how to delete that AMA. I checked his account and the front page, and the AMA was already gone. I advised him to not delete the post, but it was too late.

I just got home from work and saw Detailorient's post. After reading most of the comments in the AMA and the MFW posts

1. PTEN is a new start-up. They are barely starting to make a little profit. The company is started by a few college grads, ofc, make some profit. 
2. As a start-up
3. With no offense to Adam, I believe Adam is trying to start a company as well ( I might be wrong), so releasing these information to a possible competitor is probably not a good idea.
4. They aren't very experienced with the fancy rigging that we do. They wanted to focus on ratchets

They are still growing, I don't think they know the answer either. Even though they made many mistakes in the AMA, I don't think it's reasonable to call them douches. 

I just wanted to bring in some new content to this subreddit

And this is gonna come across as me defending PTEN

Edit: I'm texting Kyle right now

Edit 2: I've been talking to ewheat, there aren't many trickliners. Me being decent at tricklining, caught PTEN's attention. In hopes of eventually becoming a sponsored athlete and get cool shitz, I start to promote their products and providing my assistance. But I was never technically included in their company. I didn't expect this to happen from a simple AMA. As someone who has founded a couple of start-ups that eventually failed, I know how difficult it is for a new company. As a friend of the founders of PTEN, I just wanted to clarify what I know in attempt to save some reputation...I guess. As for the hating Gibbon thing, I don't hate Gibbon, it's not worth the money.

1340048823.0,v8ltr,r/Slackline FAQ,rSlackline_FAQ,19,4,12,"**What is slacklining:** The art of balancing on a flat piece of webbing anchored between two points.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

**Types of Slackline:**

* **Primitive line:** This kind of set up is usually less than 100ft long and a few ft high. This is the easiest setup

* **Longline:** A line that is not very high off the ground

* **Highline:** A line that is set up very high up from the ground. Usually the slackliner wears a harness and is leashed on the line it self.

* **Trickline:** A line that is extremely elastic under tension. Designed to let the slackliner bounce high for dynamic moves/tricks.

* **Waterline:** A line that is setup over water.

* **Rodeoline:** A line that is hung up on two relative high anchor points, throwing you off to one side.

-----------------------------------------
**Primitive line:**

There are a few ways to set up this kind of slackline. The tension is held by friction.

**3-carabiner method:** Instead of using an anchor on the non-tensioned side


[**4-carabiner method**](http://www.nwslackline.org/96/howto-setting-up-a-basic-primitive-slackline): This is one way to setup the basic ""primitive"" line. This method uses one carabiner on one anchor

[**Multiplier**](http://www.nwslackline.org/207/strength-of-3-men-for-only-20): This is a way to make pulling out the slack in your slackline easier. It's composed of pulleys

The multiplier can also be achieved using 2 extra carabiners. One biner will be clipped into the tension side anchor ([be sure to clip into the webbing like this]())



-------------------------------------------
**Longline:**

Longlines require a pulleys system to tension the line. Tension is held by a brake at the end of the pulley system. 

**Method where the pulley system stays in the rig:**

**Softpointing:** The pulley system can be removed from the rig

-------------------------
**Highline:**

----------------------------
**Trickline:**

---------------------------
**Waterline:**

------------------------------
**Rodeoline:**

5. Would I just have to buy the recommended items on the sidebar (just with like 120ft of line) or since I have a longer line do I need different gear?

To start off

-----------------------------------------------------------

[Balance Community](www.balancecommunity.com) has a great [guide on pulley systems](http://www.balancecommunity.com/Slack-Science/all-about-pulley-systems-the-complete-guide). If you are interested

--------------------------------------------------

I recently built my own pulley system

**3"" SMC PMP double pulleys:** [FeldFire](http://www.feldfire.com/SMC-Prusik-Minding-Pulley_p_712.html) sells those pulleys for about $95

**SMC Rigging Plate:** [FeldFire](http://www.feldfire.com/SMC-NFPA-Rigging-Plate_p_683.html) sells them for about $40

**Shackles:** [Trek Adventure Gear](http://trekadventuregear.com/store/) sells 1/2"" Van Beest Green Pin shackles for $7 and ARB 3/4"" shackles for $11

**Brake:** Braking devies like GriGri/Petzl Rig/Petzl I'D are usually available used on Craig's List. You can always search for items at other locations have have them mail it to you. I was able to find a GriGri for 40 bucks

**Static Rope:** I used Craig's List for that as well. Rope you HAVE to get new! Used ropes are NOT reliable because you don't know the history. Your best bet is to find people who are selling whole spools. Then you can keep some for yourself and sell the rest for a little profit.

**Spansets:** Check out [Manufacturer Express](mfrexpress.com).

**Quicklinks, just make sure they are rated high enough.

----------------------------------------------------------------

Lastly, where you can find some pretty good deals on used slackline rigging components. 



**Edit:** added spansets

**Edit 2:** Unless you have a lot of money ready to throw out

List of items in my rig:

* SMC 3"" PMP double pulleys $85 x2

* SMC rigging plate $36

* Sterling SuperStatic 11.1mm Rope 200ft $0 (I bought a spool then sold the rest)

* Petzl I'D S $120

* Van Beest 1/2"" Shackle x3: $21

* ARB 3/4"" Shackle x1: $11

* CAMP Steel D biner x3: $40

* CAMP Lift Ascender: $35

* CAMP small mobile pulley ball bearing: $17

* Alpine Web Lock: $90

* 300 ft of Type-18: $198

* 1.23"" Steel ring x2: $13.50

* Green Spanset 3' x2: $15

* Green Spanset 10'x2: $30

My goal is just to be able to get a 100ft span of nice tight 2"" line. We set up the PT line to the specifications in the instructions (2ft above the ground) and we were touching the ground in the middle... so clearly something is not right. If that's simply a limitation of the line itself... well I'm kinda disappointed. I figured my $130 would buy a nice tight 100ft span with the PT but it's far too loose in the middle for my taste.

Question 1: Can anybody direct me to some good resources on the basics of ""primitive rigging""? I feel like the block and tackle rigs are intimidating and confusing to me because I don't understand the basics beyond a simple ratchet system yet.

Question 2: Will this different type of rigging be compatible with my existing lines? I would assume so

Here is how I did it.

* I started out by watching a few [youtube videos](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TzERkdNoyw).  First I practiced balancing on my dominant foot in the middle of the line. It was seemingly impossible to do this but after a good ten min of hopping my left leg up a bout 1/2""-1"" my dominant leg got the hint of what it was supposed to be doing.  All the while I was holding my elbows in the air by my ears like that guy in the video said.  I could only stand on it for a blink of an eye before falling off

Then I could balance for a second, I tried to balance longer and longer and then get my left foot on in order to switch.  I got tired of failing and so went to grab a beer and a burger, never did get my left foot on.

After my beer and burger I went to a slackline meetup at Patterson Park in Baltimore!  There I met a few others who have been slackling for a while.  I learned some awesome tips from them and tried out a few other kinds of lines (primitive, I believe is they're the reason I was able to walk the line in one day.  

* Pick a point on the tree to focus on. (about eye level)
* Breath

As funny as it sounds those two tips are probably the most groundbreaking info for slacking I received.  Hope this helps

1366989470.0,1d5ou3,RE minis and brake. Need advice.,steikepanne,6,0,7,"Hi everyone

I bought my first pulley system last year

So there is a few things I have been thinking about especially regarding the brake placement. In the normal setup the brake is connected to the becket of the pulley with a 8mm quick link

So I have been thinking of getting a rigging plate to avoid this however it will add a bit of weight/cost/complexity to the system. A rigging plate like the DMM bat plate S will work without a twist shackle. Even smaller rigging plates will probably work with a twist shackle in most cases. What do you guys think? Rigging plates seems to be kind of outdated and not that many people are using them anymore especially with the SMC 3""

Another option is using another sling with the brake. This is cheaper and I already got the gear. All you need is a homemade sling of 1"" tubular and a 8mm bow shackle and your good to go. This makes things more flexible is cheaper but requires more gear than embedded position and is a bit more cumbersome in my opinion.


So what I am asking is how do you connect the brake when using a lightweight pulley system (RE minis


Also at last one more thing. I am using these adjustable slings: (http://www.landcruising-slacklines.de/en/shop/23-schlingen/302-st-baumschlinge-verstellbar) and they are the ones the comes with the kit. The break strength is about 30-35 kn and they are adjustable which is great

This second picture shows the yellow tension webbing doing its thing. The top carabiner is attached to the line by means of a dressed girth hitch. I know how this degrades the strength of the webbing. Rather than use a simple single biner as the friction point

http://i.imgur.com/E8JKZ.jpg 

This image shows the complete setup. You might have noticed that on the purple webbing, its simply using the diameter of the biner body as a weblock. 

So there it is, but it is significantly more gear intensive to setup. I have all this gear, so it wasn't a big deal for me, but might be for you if you want to replicate this and don't have 4 piece of webbing, about 8 carabiners, rigging rings and other various accoutrement",,self,,

I was visiting my parents last night, larger than a schoolbus... it's not going anywhere. If I were able to embed a [""climbing eye bolt""](http://acmeclimbing.com/fixestainlesssteelglueineyebolt.aspx)? it will be a great spot to rig my 100ft line.

I'm not familiar at all with these devices, and then wait a period of time for the glue to cure. I already have a drill that's suitable for putting holes in a rock, so that's not a problem.

The anchors didnt fit and on accident i unknotted one which got me thinking of different ways to setup when your current equipment doesnt meet your needs.

Heres what I did.

Untied both of the anchors, one on the other using a slip knot (i think).  The biners stayed locked and then we tied the webbing around the pillars and secured them using a bow knot (common shoelace knot) which tightens as its pulled on.  At that point the anchors were locked in so I setup the line as normal.  

I was a bit worried that the anchors would come loose

Anyone else have an interesting method or story?  

FWIW I only thought of using a slip knot because of one of the other recent threads with pictures and my brain pulled that one out as useful at the time

We set it up between two trees about 25 paces apart (about 20m I believe) and thing comes with a monster size ratchet but even so

What are your recommendations for lines of this length? How tight should the line be? How big should the sag be on a 30m line? Should I go past the recommended 2.5x turns of the ratchet to up the tension, does a thinner line usually require more or less tension?

1343440313.0,xa2g6,Re: our AMA,PTENPTEN,16,14,7,"Ok you big reddit jerks :).. we’re not lawyers.. we just want you to be safe... WE PROVIDE A MAXIMUM TENSION OF 6500lbs. Which is less than our actual breaking strength and stitch pattern break strength. 

In addition to this we have dyno’d what our ratchets can do and know  that our ratchets will never get anywhere near this max tension. (However
The reason there is such a big gap from what our ratchets can do(3000lbs if you’re the hulk) and the real limit, heat, abrasion, dust, germs, silly string, tea, unicorn hair.. basically the stuff is degrades over time...   

We think that any company that provides actual breaking strength is taking an enormous risk. Once that webbing leaves the loom it IS going to degrade. The break strengths can vary. Even Mil spec will vary by whatever amount of standard deviations are acceptable to that particular webbing... 

***everyone has complaints about ratchets and we understand. They are dangerous. This is why we explain proper use in our warning booklet. Once you understand how the ratchet works the risk of injury will decrease significantly.  

Hope that answers any unanswered questions!
