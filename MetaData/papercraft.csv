**Papercrafting with aluminium cans**
I wanted to see if papercrafting was possible using aluminium cans (ie. Coke cans)

If you've never made anything out of papercraft before



**Flattening the Cans**
First up, neaten the edges by using a pair of scissors to cut them straight and make sure there's no little sharp bits.

The method for flattening the cans that I've found works best is to use a sandwich maker (an old one, put about 4 cans in, then add another layer of baking paper on the top (this should help prevent at least a little bit of damage to the sandwich maker).

Hold the cans down flat as you close the lid

I haven't fully experimented with getting the best efficiency here

Taadaa! Flat cans! [Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/khP4q)

Other methods I have tried are:  
* Ironing (Does nothing)  
* Ironing and bending at the same time. This method works
* Clamping it between 2 pieces of wood. This does absolutely nothing
It seems like heat is very important in getting these things to stay flat.  


**Cutting the Sheets**
I printed my design out on paper first

Also, the design would probably have to be altered to give a bit of room in some corners to account for the extra thickness.

Using a knife is practically useless
Scissors on the other hand are brilliant, then use the scissors to cut up to them. It's not perfect but does the trick nicely.

You should also score the pieces using whatever you normally use to score

Folding is pretty simple


**Gluing**
This part is rather difficult, let sit for ~20minutes then push them together).

This part is going to take the majority of your time, let them sit the full 20 minutes, then push together (hold for ~10 seconds or so to make sure it's solid) before moving onto gluing 2 more pieces. Get a movie out, play some games... It'll take a while.

The contact cement wasn't the greatest however, even then it doesn't feel as strong as one would hope.

I didn't end up trying Epoxy however

Other glues I tried:  
 * Aleene's Original Tacky Glue (the metal surface was too shiny for the glue to stick once it dried). This is the glue of Papercrafting gods that I had to import from the US to Australia. It's very similar to PVA/Wood Glue
 * ""Hobby Cement"" - Same deal as the Tacky Glue above  
 * Bostik Multi Bond - Same deal as above

**Taadaa!**
And here's my end result! Would I do it again? Nope

I hope sharing sessions in this format will help everyone to improve their builds.

I will get the ball rolling:

[Here's a pic of my tools](http://i.imgur.com/hpSrq.jpg)

Here's a quick description: 

Cutting Tools:

1. A3 cutting mat: because A4 is too small.

2. NT cutter blade. I still prefer this to xactos. Refills are cheap in Singapore and I also like the die-cast metal feel of the blade body

3. 2 x metal ruler: I find that I use them a lot as I like building robots/mech models.

4. Scissors: It's something I rarely use during builds. If I wanna isolate a piece

5. Nail cutter: Excellent tool for cutting/trimming small circles :)

Gluing stuff:

1. PVA/White glue: basic gluing for matte models. Good general purpose glue.

2. UHU glue: dries glossy for glossy models

3. Goop rubber cement: fills small parts

4. Barge cement: used for butt gluing. SUPER STRONG. I used it to butt glue War machine's ammo belt to the gattling gun. 

5. Toothpicks: excellent for glue application

6. Syringe: for very precise glue application. It is also useful for getting glue into hard to reach areas.

7. Palette: I use it to hold pva glue which I then apply using tooth picks. 

Scoring/Folding:

1. Tweezer: I use it to fold small parts

2. Embossing tool: I tried using this as a scoring tool but the smallest tip is still too thick for me.

3. Paper piercer: I sanded the tip of this to make a scoring tool

Misc: 

1. Zig Marker: If you only have 1 marker for edge coloring

http://www.thisiscolossal.com/2012/01/riusuke-fukahori-paints-three-dimensional-goldfish-embedded-in-layers-of-resin/

I was thinking i could use layers of printed transperencies and get the same effect without having to paint it. But then i though maybe i could submerge an entire paper model so the object could be in like a wine glass and be viewed from multple angles. I am thinking of making a weding gift for some friends that is one of a kind.

Anyone ever heard of anyone trying this? I found resin on amazon and there are plenty of tutorials for using resin in miniature scenery but i cant find anyone doung this. Perhaps because the stuff is toxic and takes 8 hours to dry and bubbles are a nightmare.

TLDR resin + papercraft could be cool

So I'm almost done with this build I designed

Here's a list of problems I ran into:

* Closing off parts was a pain. I focused making the seams more visually pleasing rather than easier for the builder. As such
* I had massive problems with small parts. Since I'm using ~65 lb paper, or would that look weird? I haven't tried it yet. I *could* scale it up, but the model is already 10 inches tall or so.
* This applies more to 3D modeling
* Just reporting that I forgot to add eyebrows to the texture and I had already glued the head down at the time I noticed. I decided to try to pen it in
