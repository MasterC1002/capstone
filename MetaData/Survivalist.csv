",loogielv,5, I envy those that go out with nothing and create sustainability.  I used to camp alot as a kid and I'd wonder why dad would bother bringing matches and lighter fluid.  Why not just rub sticks together?  Sure it would take longer

At any rate, and letting them connect with nature (and lets be honest, me) in a way that was so important to me growing up.

We watch Man Vs Wild together and Survivorman and a number of other ones.  We talk about it, I have nothing.

Now I will admit

I do have a ruck sack

I'm ashamed, mini fishing kits etc, and I know I can build them each a set for under $20.   Sure we may never need them and still won't have the money to camp more than once a year, but the real treat will be sitting down with them and building them.  

So I just wanted to come clean.  I thought it might be cool to document (here on reddit, but maybe not.  

Either way, who built his own survival kit, my boy perked up.  He was excited, said he wanted to do it too.  So I gave him an Altoid's tin I had and he walked around looking for things to put it in.

""We can put these crayons on there. Never know when you need crayons in the wild dad

Now, some screws, a tiny magnifying glass, a tiny leatherman knock off, a pencil sharpener ""for shaving sticks to make fires"" he said, which is brilliant, and some small rubber gaskets he found, but he thought looked cool in there. Awesome

Well I've recently taken some steps

This will be a multi-part series

This first part, or preparedness.  To put it another way, stuff that we should be doing NOW, to begin to prepare, though not quite preparing...more like ""practicing""

What I did to learn these things, and instead of firing up the chainsaw, I climbed that fucker and took a $5 hatchet to the limbs. 

I then used the wood and branches for me and my sons to build what I told them was a fort, and we spent some good time together, and all the while, I was practicing and learning.

Below are some newbish things that I learned:

* **Swing your hatchet** This means, you need to have your muscles and hands in check.  See, the first time you use your hatchet, you will earn yourself blisters, and sore muscles.  Your muscles will cramp up mid-swing if these activities are foreign to your body. Hot spots will develop on your hands that will put you in agony.  This pain and agony will not kindly subside and wait merely because you HAVE TO finish for the sake of your family.  You WILL have to work through it, and that could equal a lack of concentration or effort on your part, which could be deadly for you or your family. 

Instead, you won't have real pain.  Do it every weekend if you can, or at least bi-weekly.

* **FUCK that hatchet.  Bring a saw!** Obviously this counter points the above, or even just carry a small saw that coils up like cordage.  I would link these, but I feel that if you take the time to search google or just youtube, you will stumble onto many more videos that will be better than anything I post.  You can take a 20 minute journey and learn infinitely more than clicking one link that I include. 

When I was in that tree and was chopping away at a large branch, and already had blisters.  In order to chop the rest, I would have had to climb up even higher (I was about 25 feet off the ground, w/o a ladder, at this point) then hang down to chop the rest of the way.  That was just not going to happen, safely. So instead, I finished the limb with a regular saw I had and it was a breeze.  I instantly learned that there's a time and a place for a hatchet, save energy, I'm merely reminding everyone

* **Learn knots** I cannot exaggerate the importance of this enough.  Knots are knowledge that is un-rivaled in terms of power and safety.  Sure you can just tie the shit out of a rope over and over again and it will surely hold

Let me paint a picture for you. You're on the edge of a cliff
You might only have a small rope available.  Maybe your daddy even taught you to tie a ""bowline"" knot (a knot that makes a non sliding loop) You think, or chimney, and climb down""  but did you know a bowline INSTANTLY makes your rope 55% weaker?  A rope with a bowline is 45% as strong as that same rope, without.  If you only have a small rope and it needs to hold 150-200lbs down the side of a building, do you really want to risk weakening that rope?

What if you don't have a rope
Or even still

Learn knots.  They're an under-appreciated art form and their uses are ENDLESS.  The most important knots to learn, **""The double fisherman""** (also the double fisherman loop), **""the bowline""** and the stronger brothers of it, **""the blood knot""** (a very strong knot great for fishing, which maintains 85-90% of the cordage strength. also known as ""barrel knot""), **""The zeppelin bend""** (a fantastic way to join 2 ropes securely).  But dont stop there, learn at least 4 hitches (a way to join a rope to another object, branch, I feel searching (even if just on youtube) will take you on a much more valuable journey into other knots that will be more beneficial for many people.  

* **Make a hammock**  I'm not talking about weaving a hammock out of rope.  I'm talking about taking a large blanket, imo) Also, here is a link to [THE DOUBLE FISHERMAN LOOP](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyvEk8y5g_k&amp;feature=related) which the creator uses to secure the sheet.

Now this might sound retarded

* 1) You learn AND PRACTICE knots.  Not only the knot that secures the rope to the sheet

* 2) You can take the hammock apart

* 3) In a survival situation, blankets, ground liners, even sew it or tie it as an overcoat, or clothing)
* 4) You can spend time with your kids, its a wonderful thing to lay in a homemade hammock in your backyard with your kids or even a pet. I swear, its a beautiful feeling.

After a week or so, and make it again.  Make smaller ones for your kids using beach towels, or a giant one made from an old king size comforter for the entire family to lay in. Now that you know knots, you can adjust your cordage size accordingly without worry of it breaking. 

* **GO CAMPING!!!**  Take your kids camping, but none of that matters now, (and I'll cover these things to practice like primitive traps in the next part ""The End is in Sight"") 
For now

The apocalypse will be a bumpy ride

1372274268.0,1h4ler,Advice on Selecting a Power Generator,rlconkl,11,3,21,"Recent storms have reignited my desire to get a generator for the house.

I'm trying to be less tacti*cool* and consider what ""disasters"" are most likely to affect my home/family. Spring storms have made power outages unfortunately common in my area (Midwest US) and, spoiled refrigerated/frozen food, an inability to run the furnace, and general inconvenience.  If the outage were to last multiple days, we'd appreciate the ability to periodically charge mobile phone batteries, radio batteries, flashlights

I've looked at typical [power consumption for devices](http://powerequipment.honda.com/generators/generator-wattage-estimation-guide) I'd like to keep running,500 startup / ~4,000 running wattage.

I'm curious if any of you guys can provide insight on some questions I have:

**Any group thoughts on fuel choices?**

* **Liquid Propane** tends to be my favorite option.  It can be store relatively safely (and seemingly indefinitely) in portable 20lb tanks.
* **Natural gas** is delivered to our home and would *hopefully* remain available during a power outage. Anyone have experience as to whether this is usually the case?  I'm not aware of any portable option
* **Gasoline** lacks in long-term storage ability

**Any group thoughts on portability?**

* The super light/quiet units (e.g. [Honda's EU2000i](http://powerequipment.honda.com/generators/models/eu2000i))
* Somewhat larger units (e.g. [Generac's LP5500](http://www.electricgeneratorsdirect.com/Generac-6001-Portable-Generator/p10205.html)) are arguably *portable*

**Any thoughts on brands?**

* There are definitely the well-known brands in the market: Honda, are less-known.
* Does the reliability/durability vary widely?  Is it worth paying more for the name brand?

Ideally

Any specific product recommendations?

What happens if my desired devices consume more power than my generator is capable of producing?  Will it blow an internal breaker and require a reset?  If this were to happen regularly,False,,t5_2qoov,False,,,t3_1h4ler

My main problem is where the fine line between practicality and how much I like the style of the pack is. I love WWII stuff or any military surplus (especially if it's plain OD green) so my first pack system was an m1953 webbing system

My second pack (and the one I'd like to upgrade from) is an old medium ALICE pack without the frame. And it's pretty decent, the auxiliary pockets need to be either bigger or smaller, and placed somewhere else, possibly on the hip.

1358564504.0,16uu9v,Discussion topic: Self defense.,soviet_admin,7,1,3,"Our main goal and purpose

Let's face it, there will be those that are not doing well that will want what we have. When times are uncertain and people worry about what they will get tomorrow, they will likely want ALL that you have. Unless you are over 2 meters tall (6 foot something) and over 100kg of muscle (220lbs,) you are vulnerable to bad people that want what you have.

So lets get this rolling a bit

**Close combat**

No ammo needed, you are limited to one assailant at a time. Best options would be a hatchet, machete, or other short to long cutting/slicing/hacking instrument. This is really not the ideal weapon, this will leave far more emotional/psychological scars than any other weapon, and should be considered a last resort weapon, next to your fists.

**ranged**

Bow/crossbow: Excellent short to medium range weapon, hit targets past 25 yards. If you have the skill, this is your weapon of choice, hands down. Keep extra strings and maybe a spare bow. Go for traditional wooden bows, recurves will eventually wear and are a pain to restring.

Firearms: unless you are in one of the less free countries

**Pistols**

Reliable pistols are not hard to come by

Glock 19, will live through many tens if not hundreds of thousands of rounds, assuming you didn't get a lemon out of the factory (not likely, but it happens with all guns.) Shoots 9mm NATO, cheap round, easy to stock and practice with. For those who reload, not as recommended of a firearm due to the nature of semi-autos. Good alternatives include the XD

Ruger blackhawk (357), especially if shooting lead bullets and keeping velocity under 900 fps, this gun will outlive you, no matter how many hundreds of thousands of rounds put through it. If reloading, it's incredibly cheap to shoot, practice can be brought down to less than 11 cents per shot. If buying new ammo, it's 16 bucks for a box of 50 38 special instead of 11 bucks for 9mm. Alternatives would include any revolver made by a reputable manufacturer

**Shotgun**

This is incredibly important, but I would stick with a mossberg 500 series or a remington 870. These can take out large game out to over 200 yards with rifled slugs, and smaller game at shorter distances depending on ammo selected. 

This is an excellent all around self defense long arm with the ability to also hunt very effectively. Keep the barrel length to 20 inches or less for portability

Again

**Rifles**

So you have a shotgun and maybe a pistol

A 22lr.

That wimpy round? Yes, and at the same price. You have a shotgun and a pistol, which are perfect for protecting yourself, even with the numbers against your favor, the rifle will not improve things much, so this is a purchase for the end-game/long-run.

Okay, so far the most expensive thing you've bought by now was the pistol, followed by ammo, the shotgun, and the 22 rifle of your choice.

Cool, then get ammo for it.)

* AK/AR (Yes, choose AR, if you plan on roughing it for a long time without access to cleaning supplies, AK)
* Mini14/30
* Mosin Nagant

And to summarize all of the above, practice, practice.",,False,,t5_2qoov,,http://www.reddit.com/r/Survivalist/comments/16uu9v/discussion_topic_self_defense/

NOTE: I use zombies as a catch all Katrina-like emergency as it can apply to any location where natural or other disasters can strike(Earthquakes, Mexican cartel, FEMA lol, you name it)

Here's a couple of realistic situations

* You have nothing but what is on you and you are thrust into a situation requiring you to improvise to survive

* You are involved in an auto related accident/situation

* You are hiking when suddenly things take a turn for the worse, etc, and you are forced to survive in the wilderness.

* You are camping/backpacking when suddenly things take a turn for the worse requiring you to go into survival mode.  I split this as the  difference between this and hiking is you likely have much more gear on your person

* The zombies have come a) You are at work and have what is on your person and in your office; potentially what is in your car, c) you are home.

What made /r/I_am_the_last_one so successful was the user content. We've created unique guidelines and rules to follow. We did this by taking the most popular ""recurring themes"" found in everyone's stories and created a type of ""rendezvous"" point in which everyone comes together to understand the ""most popular"" themes and include them in their stories.

Reading a bit around some reddit post

So to start the discussion

Water :

1x 10 liter MSR water bladder
2x 1 liter stainless steel water bottle

That's all there is to it, it can go down to -20 F (-29 C). I heard some people talking about purification tablets, and I'll admit that I know nothing about these.

Food :

3x Mountain house meals
1x MSR stainless steel cooking pot (775 ml)
1x GSI scrapper (to clean the cooking pot)

I currently ownsome moutain house meal, they fit nicely in the backpack by filling the empty space. The cooking pot is also use to boil water and store my tea (I use this backpack for hinking or just to chill innawoods nearby). I've heard of a recipe some time ago which is easy to do yourself andcontain honey, maple syrup, sugar, peanuts butter, assorted nuts, and some other things I don't remeber. the point of the recipe was to put the mixture in a ziploc

Shelter :

1x Inflatable sleeping pad
1x 50 F (10 C) rectangular sleeping bag
1x 8x10 tarp (used as a ground tarp)
1x 10x12 tarp (ued as a tarp aove the tent)
1x 3 person el cheapo tent

I plan to buy very soon (my next big guy in fact) a military sleeping bag which is confortable down to minus 40 (C or F, I'm wondering if a hammock wouldn't be a better idea, seeing as trees are everywhere for miles and miles.

Clothing :

4x Cotton earth-toned T-shirt
1x Short
1x Construction-grade work pants
5x Cotton underwear
6x (Probably) cotton socks
1x Cold weather jacket
1x Spring/fall hunting jacket
1x Hunting rain boots
1x Cold winter hat
1x Cold winter scarf
1x Cold winter gloves
1x Leather work gloves
1x Old pair of running shoes
1x Poncho-like jacket

I don't really know what to say of this one

Tools : 

1x 26'' bushcraft axe
1x Hatchet
1x Sharpening stone
3x Fixed blade knife (SOG seal pup
1x Folding saw
1x Folding shovel
1x Leather wave multitool
1x 10'' vise-grip
1x 16'' bolt-cutter
1x 12'' pipe wrench
1x Multi-tips screwdriver
1x Set of files

After highschool, or maybe I need to reduce some of it, I'm all ears.

Light/fire : 

3x Bic lighters
2x Firesteel
120x Waterproof (?) matches in a waterproof case1
1x Military style light (L shaped + red light option)
1x Maglight LED (Which use AA's like the previous military light)
16x AA battery
+ a strap to put the maglight on the side of the head.

I've heard about those headlamp

Navigation :

1x quality compass
1x ''Map'' of my area printed out of google earth (in ziploc bag)

I do not own a GPS

Hyigiene/FAK :

1x Toothbrush
1x Classic bathroom towel
20x band-aid
10x Steril gauze pad
1x Elastic bandage
1x Roll of medical tape
1x Classic ointment (for small cuts and burns)

I feel that of all the area, toothbrush and running water I was able to keep myself as clean as needed. It's amazing to see that we don't even need toothpaste and soap to stay clean. the only compromise I had to do was to clean myself 3 times a day instead of one. As for the first aid kit, I don't remember even putting on a band-aid, but being prepared in case of injury is important even if it has never happened before.

Other : 

1x Sewing kit (very basic
1x Crossman .177 pellet rifle
+ lubrification oil and +/- 1500 pellets
1x Small fishing kit (100' 20 lbs test
2x Spare prescription glasses
1x Small radioshack one way radio
1x Ocarina
1x 550' of small twine


If you've gone through all this or parts of it : thank you very much

Have a nice day !
