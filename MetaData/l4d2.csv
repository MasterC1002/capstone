I'm still obsessed with Left 4 Dead 2 and I'll still attempt to get games together via the two l4d2 steam groups associated with this subreddit every now and then.  Join the [reddit versus group](http://steamcommunity.com/groups/rl4d2vs)

The server listed in the sidebar is still going to be there for a while; it's rented for another three months; feel free to use it if I'm not doing so myself.  The mumble server is owned by null_vector and hopefully it isn't going anywhere; I and others that met through these events are there pretty often

And that's it.  Huge thanks to Jerameme, and sweet_nightmares for helping organize these events, and thanks to null_vector, gulliver.bear, Hoopersonic, and felix_the_cat for regularly joining in so often.  This little experiment in social media/gaming community building would've been impossible for me to keep going if it weren't for you guys.

* Modify the comment section to add greater visual difference in longer comment threads.

* Change the header or footer to some artwork of the Survivors

* Modify the ""Submit a Link"" Button to be more eye-catching

* Add a defined rules hover-effect to the ""Submit a Link"" Button (look at /r/letsplayLoL)

It would likely be a 4v4 VS server located in the center of the US for the most even pings for the largest number of people (if you put it on the east or west coast half the people will get 110ms pings

I would also likely make a map-pack for quick download of the custom maps that will be on the server as well. If enough people think they would join in

It started off slow, at least until The Sacrifice came out, then it went crappy again. And the same thing happened again when Cold Stream was released.

There are several threats when coming into an official dedicated or local server game


-- Valved (This completely resets the game


--  Instant Finale (The rescue vehicle appears instantly


--  Random Server Shutdowns (Self explanatory)


--  Ghost Infected Grab (A person in ghost mode will grab a survivor

The official servers are so bad (consistent, if the host gets Valved, then the whole game is returned to lobby.

**1. Time Commitment**
*This first complaint is mostly a personal issue and I don't blame the game*
A personal issue for me is being a cigarette smoker. If I am playing a game and my heart is racing I am going to want a cigarette more then anything after a few heart pounding rounds. It's practically impossible to get seven other people to wait three minutes for me to afk half way through a game. I don't smoke inside and I game upstairs. I wish each chapter was considered a game itself but still back to back
  
I rarely finish a game with all the players I start with. For most games I play online it is quite different. It seems expected to me that I will not necessarily finish with the people I start with. I don't know if other people share the same opinion, children, phone calls, pets and life's random acts make it almost impossible to dedicate uninterrupted time for anyone that doesn't live at their parent's house unemployed. I am not trying to insult anyone I am just trying to state that I would think for anyone in a relationship, who has a job where they can be reached at anytime or live with people get interrupted a lot during a day. committing with seven other people for over an hour is hard in a day and age where a game of Call of Duty is less then ten minutes at a time. I stand firm about chapters as games themselves, with the whole campaign as a tournament. That way you would still get a sense of accomplishment and/or closure while still getting a sense of victory for the overall experience. Either that, or implement some sort of intermission.  
  
**2. The Community**
At this point I have already come to terms with the fact that I'm either going to make an elaborate excuse for an afk break or quit the game early. So I've given in to the cold reality and decided to play anyway. It's Russian Roulette trying public matches. Out of all of the post attempts to find like minded players I have amassed over fifty friends on Steam. I know three of them in real life, it's hard to keep anyone together long enough. This reduces me to public matches.  
  
Some of the most ignorant, I have met through Left 4 Dead 2. Tonight alone I was kicked for not speaking another language, spawning as a special infected someone else wanted, scoring too much, scoring too little, and twice I have no idea nobody said or did anything. Out of the eight matches I attempted tonight I finished none. I was kicked from six. Six games. It is almost impossible to please anyone. Recently I have been kicked for only having 70 hours on my playtime, even though I have over 100 on the Xbox 360 version. I attempt to talk on my microphone and I'm lucky to find anyone else that does. On the occasions that I do have teammates with mics we don't talk outside of introductions. Out of the hundreds of games I have started only a small hand few have I ever been able to use real teamwork and coordination. Those few games are the reason I play. The rush I get from thinking about it is indescribable. Knowing that I not only met random strangers over the internet, calling off plays
  
**The bitter truth**
Left 4 Dead and Left 4 Dead 2 are some of the most fun experiences I have had playing. It's not that often a game will come around so much I want to buy it for other people. It's like trying to play Goldeneye 64 back in the day if you were snowed in. There is nothing more frustrating then the time I waste trying to enjoy something. The worst part is that I know where it comes from. Valve is basically know for their kick ass games and support. It's unfortunate that Team Fortress 2 can get so much focus but there is no signs of improvement over the versus modes of this series. The Official Left 4 Dead 2 forums is littered with posts just like this

Then there's me! I'm basically the go-between from the community and the dev-team. [Raptoxr](http://steamcommunity.com/id/raptoxr/). I help with concepts and ideas

**PLEASE NOTE**: Community input is taken on board, with ideas being forwarded by you guys! In addition to this, another Assistant Director can be appointed if any of you are enthusiastic enough to do it! We just need a bit of your time and brainpower :)

It's a bit hard to express this, this project will die without the community's support. I beg of you, don't let this amazing concept fall off your radar! We have a strict timeframe on this (want it out by the end of Summer at the latest), as Avy is moving on to pastures new, and I myself will be heading off to uni. If it's not done by September, I think it'd be best left on the scrapheap - just joking, we'd open source it and let people cannibalise our work to make new maps!

I played on xbox for a couple years and switched over to PC in 2011. I immediately was drawn into the whole idea of ""confogl"". It interested me that the modding community was working on making the changes that they thought were for the best as far as balance goes. To skip a bunch of filler info

Recently we were able to get some better statistics with a stat tracker that was added to the config and we realized that people were wiping on average 75% of the time (99% on finales). It was then that I realized for too long we thought that making the game harder was balancing it. Lately I have been working with some other developers on making the config more balanced for all levels of play and wondered what stops you from playing? Was it the community? The config being too hard / elitist? Or was it something else? I'm here to try to work with you guys to make something we can all enjoy.

""Lone Gunman"" removes all special except Boomer and boss. Player must navigate campaign using only a magnum pistol, forcing the player to restart the chapter. (Not sure about on easier difficulties; I only play it on Expert)

Both of these mutators offer good fun and good challenge, helps develop player-vs-special skills, as well as strategies for facing/strategically evading specials. It will also help train headshots, as you will need to earn quick kills on that surprise hunter or the sneaky smoker, etc. LG helps teach the player to check corners and minimize damage since it leaves no room for error. Since any scratch can incap a player, they must be defensive- but not slow- the AI director is picky and is likely to spawn a horde if the player is not moving fast enough.

About four or five months ago I joined one of these modded servers running dead center and played an amazingly odd versus game. OK enough back story

It started out with infected team spawning only as chargers with 1hp every 3 seconds... If you hit with the charge you would do the normal smash and pound

Next round it was only hunters with &lt;100 health every 3 seconds.  Quite fun i must say.

The following round it was all spitters with fast spawn... with double spit and after spit immunity.  

After that it was the strangest finale I have ever seen.  Upon reaching the atrium I noticed there were cans already by the car and no infected to be seen.  We get into the elevator and it begins taking us down.  When we reach the bottom floor we are greeted by a fresh Jimmy Gibbs Jr. zombie that will not die.  A message sprawls across the screen that says ""Jimmy Gibbs is stealing your ride!""  Oddly enough this is exactly what he does... Gets in the car and drives it off the platform

At this point I am like wow that was fucked up

Also

I want this mod and have a server to load it onto for hours of enjoyment.  I was hoping someone on here would know something about it but if not oh well

1366301708.0,1cm2ue,Feedback on my server concept please,hugo_montenegro,7,0,3,"I recently started a L4D2 coop server and I am having a blast running it. One unexpected benefit of having a server is getting to hear what different players like and dislike about the game.  I have emphasized the aspects of L4D2 I enjoy most on my server

Now I know that some people, I want to politely request that anyone who wants to express their dislike of modded servers in general simply refrain from responding.  It's an interesting debate, but not what I'd like to focus on here.  Thanks.

OK

The goal of my server is to increase the challenge of advanced coop in a manner that encourages constant teamwork and clear communication

Here is a breakdown of the server setup:

* No Tier 2 weapons spawn
* No melee weapons spawn
* Tier 1 weapons usually spawn at level start and a few other places but not always
* All Tier 2 weapons have 2/3 normal ammo capacity
* No throwables spawn
* No Medkits spawn in the saferoom or finales
* Any item can be purchased (even those that don't spawn)

Points Awarded:

Heal or defib teammate: +5, seems to be about 40% of the time)
Kill witch +4 (one player)
Kill 25 regular infected +2

Cost:

Military Sniper -14, Spas/Auto -10
Hunting Rifle -8, Throwables -8
Health kit -20, Ammo -8

* Any item can be dropped with a chat command
* Any item except weapons can be shoved to a teammate like pills
* The witch is slightly more sensitive and causes automatic b+w
* Friendly fire is reflected to attacker
* The saferoom door can only be unlocked by one randomly chosen survivor each round.

As you an imagine tough decisions need to be made when purchasing health items.  Getting a tier 2 is a game changer, your weapons and items go back to where they were at start of round, but the points you spent do not come back.

Long periods are spent with low health as pills must be saved for when a tank comes

All of the planning and points accumulation comes together at the finale.  Because their are no health kits, an on-point team will usually finish with all survivors.  If points were wasted and teamwork was poor, the finale can be come a struggle that is, at times unwinnable.

This far more challenging than a vanilla coop game, but I have found so far that a good team always has enough for events and finales.  When you have bad teammates, however, you realllllly feel it.  Accept in very specific conditions, winning teams *never* heal themselves on my server, and the coordination of when to purchase health vs defib takes a vocal team.

What I've arrived at then is not something equivalent to the challenge of Expert, limits the impact that a single dominant player can have on a team, and requires all team members to play an active roll.

So... for those of you who like modded servers, what would make it better or more interesting?

My steam name is stancrispy.  The steam group is Crispycrawlers L4D2 Server.  It is public so if you would like to try the server for yourself

See server and player stats at [crispycrawlers.com](http://crispycrawlers.com/stats)

Cheers

sc

A last little note... I have found that with pubs the server causes a bit too many rage quits, I made an easier version of the server where points accumulate quickly, and some of the challenges are reduced or removed (health kits, for instance, do spawn at finales in this mode).  If you happen onto my server and it is in easy mode, my apologies.  Send me a message on Steam and we'll set up a game XD",,self,,

I've noticed a increase of players lately due to the sale

Survivors: This is the easiest part! If you've played a fps game before you already know the basics

1. Get a mic if possible. This helps so much with the teamwork aspect of the game. If you can't get a mic

2. Let people know you are new. People are bound to be more patient

3. Stay close to the survivors. Don't go off shopping for items by yourself. Don't lead

3. Use your items wisely. Pipes are for when you are all in danger of going down or a tank is attacking and you've been boomed, let a more experienced player know, so that you aren't the reason your team loses to the tank. No one likes that. Shots aren't for health use unless nessicary, usually they are used if you have to get some one up in a hurry.

That's about if for the survivors. Your probably like

Infected advice. This is without a doubt the hardest part of versus to get used too. Here's what I got for you.

1. Attack as a group. If you've got a spawn ready

2. Learn to respawn. If you spawned and the survivors some how got away don't fret. Run backwards

And here I'll do s general guide to how to effectively attack its specials.

Boomer: The backbone to any good attack. The key is to blind as many survivors as possible so that the high damage infected (i.e. charger and hunter) can do as much damage as possible. You'll want to go in before them. Your stumble from being shot is also useful around ledges and spit.

Hunter: Pounce when you know that you have the best chance of staying on the longest. After a boomer

Smoker: Pull survivors over edges when ever possible. That is the most useful you can be. Also when you know the survivors are about to drop down a hole as a group, and gut you.

Charger: You have the unique ability to kill any survivor if you charge the off an edge. Make sure you have a smoker or a jockey set you up

Spitter: The second utility special. Your job is to wait until a hunter or charger nails someone

Jockey: Similar to the smoker

The witch: You cannot control the witch. But you can help her out. If you see survivors nearing, she gets extremely mad extremely fast. 

The Tank: If you don't feel like your up to the damage, and keep note of which survivors have them.

As a former Counter Strike player

I've noticed L4D2 has a severe lack in crosshair customization. 
I'm well aware of the standard console commands (for the few unaware):  


    cl_crosshair_green (0-255)

    cl_crosshair_red (0-255)

    cl_crosshair_blue (0-255)

    cl_crosshair_thickness (1-5)

    cl_crosshair_alpha (0-255)

    cl_crosshair_dynamic (0-1)



But these are hardly aqeduate for my needs. I was wondering if there are any decent ways to alter the crosshair to a greater extent. I'm an advocate of skins/mods

First

Second, like the name of the current custom campaign or the mutation; thus we have an announcement of the event without having the post that feels kind of redundant sometimes; the downside being that we have nowhere to discuss the games if needed, but I guess if someone has a grievance to air or an idea, they can just start a thread.

Finally, there are two events every week; custom campaign night, and versus night.  Occasionally there is a beginners night when we think there is interest.  So I thought I'd throw a couple of ideas out there.

* Mutation night - this would likely happen on Friday nights
 
* 2v2 night - I really like 2v2 confogl, assuming anyone is there.  I'd love for there to be an easy way to switch maps on the fly instead of relying on pre-set campaign (winner selects next map?), but I'm not sure how that would work without everyone being kicked out of the server on every map change.  

* Reddit teams - In a discussion about a game that happened on Thursday night a couple of weeks ago, it'd be pretty cool; any thoughts?  This could be a one night a week thing where challenges could be announced and accepted in a thread or we could do a reddit ladder if someone wants to set it up.

1335936756.0,t2vdz,recount that one crazy yet perfect run where you felt shit ton of butterflies sloshing in your stomach,tj1987,8,4,13,"There were two separate runs in which I experienced a never-had-before amount of adrenaline gushing through my system.

First was Coldstream's finale, a bile, and a combat shotgun. Stabbed the lame thigh with the motherfucking shot, ran around tank and headed straight for the tunnel. Having played this game countless times, I knew very well, being separated from the pack, meant that I'd be targeted by specials and hordes from ahead. My fight or flight response quickly kicked in, causing my hands and fingers to tremble out of fear and excitement. I did not experience time slowing down, when this horde came up, I threw that bad boy on the ground. Horde enveloped around me

Second run was a versus game, and hiked up the escalator. Alarm blaring. Specials spawning. You think a smoker pulling you off the escalator is bad news? Try tank and charger combo. Before I could calm my fucking legs to assess the situation, three out of three of my teammates went down. I had on me a combat shotgun and a moly. Nothing else. Still on second floor, I ran around the escalator, knowing the tank would come after me. I threw a moly on my legs, and the tank, which was 2 ft away from me, with the tank still hot on my heels. I saw my teammates all curled up in a bunch at the bottom of the escalator. A question briefly crossed my mind: do I rescue them, with only one goal in mind. Keep my distance from the flaming tank. Again, with a big ass alligator closing the gap behind me. I shoved. I pushed. I blasted a few shots right in between the eyes of the undead. I broke free

TL;DR: Super heightened senses in adrenaline filled runs

We've been having a blast just playing the offline Co-op with two computer controller survivors.  We blew through the campaigns on L4D2 on Normal and upped the difficulty to Advanced for a greater challenge.  We played through Dead Center

We started Dark Carnival
We wiped 4 or 5 times before we called it quits for the night.  The problem seems to be our AI companions.  We start the coaster then bum rush to the other end.  The other two keep up for a little bit but always fall behind or off the track

Does anyone know of a different strategy that works when you've got two AI?  We haven't really had to babysit them at any other point.  I know the obvious answer is 'just play with a full team'

The game worked without any problem with the low settings I have been using. No lag
I have already tried to mess with the video settings, and I dusted and looked inside my computer to make sure the fans are running. Fans are running and none of those have fixed the issue. I tried Portal 2 as well and I get the same thing (crazy triangle cutouts). I did remove visual C++ and visual studio from my computer recently, dunno if that might be the issue or is my graphics card done for? Also if I have to buy a new graphics card what do you suggest for under $140?  

L4D2 video settings:  
Aspect Ratio - Normal(4:3)  
Resolution - 1024 x 786  
Anti-Aliasing - None  
Filtering Mode - Trilinear  
Wait For Vertical Sync - Disabled  
Shader
Multicore Rendering - Disabled  
Paged Pool - High

AMD Athlon II X2 245  
Graphics: ATI Radeon HD 4200

so far my plan is to, boot all the bots, turn off the fog, no clip, run ""exec screenshots"" to remove glows and HUD and hide the players hands. use cl_showpos to make sure my altitude stays the same. hover across the map in a grid like fashion taking load of screenshots. then run the screenshots into a panorama photostitching program to merge them. manually touch things up in photoshop if i need to.

some of the maps with multiple layers of indoors areas will be difficult

Anyway... I'm thinking of having a couple people over for a small doomsday party that involves split-screen zombie-killing with Wiimotes. This is based off of a weekend project I worked on last week that allows me to easily create custom functions for a Wiimote in Linux (not just standard keybindings or joystick emulation).

It won't take much work tomorrow to customize it for L4D2 (which I'll be running under wine this weekend

I think the nunchuck extension should be a requirement

Here is what I'm thinking so far. First

nunchuck control stick = forward, strafe right

nunchuck C button = jump

nunchuck Z button = crouch

nunchuck shake = push back

wiimote B (trigger) button = shoot

wiimote shake = reload

And here is everything I'm not so sure about...

Aiming: I already have a sensor bar on top of my TV, and there is definitely no way to change that. So to aim, you would need to point at the target, then follow the target as it is brought to the center of the screen, and shoot when it's in the crosshairs. Sensitivity will play an important role, but let me know if you think there are other things I should consider. The thing that I'm mostly worried about is that aiming needs to just feel right...

What should be mapped to ""A"" on the wiimote? It seems like it should be something important. 

wiimote - and + buttons = scoped weapon zoom in/zoom out? Is that even an option in the input settings? I can't remember...

wiimote dpad = I'm thinking should be something involving switching between weapons

wiimote buttons 1 and 2 = I'm thinking they should bring up the voice commands menu

Is there anything else I'm not considering?
