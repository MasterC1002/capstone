One day I was in a tricycle with a friend, ""Ang Tundo Man May Langit Din"" on the ""dashboard"" inside. I got really excited and told my friend that my HS Filipino Literature class required me to read it and that I was impressed by it. Friend immediately said in his loud and assuming voice, ""Oh, then maybe a student passenger left it!""

I was silent, ""do you know how Lapu-Lapu died?"" And I smiled the biggest smile! I was about to hear a corny joke, I was sure of it!! (Books and corny jokes are my source of happiness.)

My friend also smiled, ""I forgot. How did he die?""

I didn't get the corny joke I expect to hear. The driver proceeded to tell us about the real story of it all, his hatred for Aguinaldo, his respect for Rizal, his *x* feeling for hero *y*... emotions louder than the sound of the tricycle moving us to our destination. Our respect for him increasing with each word he said.

A priest was asked to replace her and he was late. I didn't even understand why a priest was needed because my wife and I wanted to be married by the state. He was wearing a gold watch

He asks the people getting married to sign the attendance form and also asked us to indicate our religion. I wrote Atheist. I thought the form was meant for them to not offend other religions but it didn't matter. We started with a prayer and then a sermon for an hour. A priest telling us what family means. What sex means. What having kids mean. All are things he doesn't know fuck all about.

I was pissed. My wife and I chose to be married by the state to avoid this stupid ritual. Here's the kicker.

He tells us, inside I was fuming. I kept reminding myself how important this day is for my wife.
 
When it came time to say the vows

""I love you. Don't look at him or anyone else but me. Ignore him. We will speak our own words. This is our moment not his or Jesus'. We will start a family. I will do anything for you and no religion, not dictated by this man....""

I went on longer and declared my desire to give my wife a better life one day. Away from all this. We've talked numerous times of moving to Canada. I say this with a voice of confidence and everyone can hear me saying something different from what the priest is saying. I tried to speak over the loud mic the priest was using so my wife can hear.

You have to understand that Philippines is not a country of the middle class, all without complaint. ANd you'd think why? How can the government not do anything about this? 

Why should they? These people are practically election farms

80% is considered poor, because the two giants youre against wants the status quo to stay. The poor, helpless with what they have, clinging to the politicians for bought votes. And the rich, who are mostly the politicians themselves, coupled with their self-interest in their respective business. 

It is against the politicians' interest to nurture the middle-class, while the people know shit about their platforms. Lemme ask you why you voted for noynoy, and people will answer either ""kasi kung walang corrupt walang mahirap"" or ""son of cory and ninoy"" as if these reasons are enough to vote a president of poor senate performance. And you know what? It *is* enough, for the votes that matter, that is. 

And you'll find out that this Aquino is friends with that Ayala, celebrating the fact that by maintaining the poor, we still keep paying people dirt shit wages. And that  the Aquino's Luisita farm will never receive what is due to them, but that's ok. Their votes don't matter. The majority will still be drones for whatever shit the media, ruled by the Lopez - Aquinos friend - will feed them. And what about the healthcare? The rich can handle it, and the poor can go ahead with a low quality free service from at-the-corner clinics. Heck, some even have free lodging if they don't pay their fees because they **get to stay in the hospital if they don't pay.** 

You tell us why can't we solve the corruption? By all means, incentivises it. Please do correct me when I say that corruption is universal, the same way that Murdoch is buying your politicians. Our politicians, being businessmen themselves, are buying the poor's votes. With the middle class's tax money, no less!

The only group who I think would and should benefit from change is the middle class, etc etc. Then I realize I am still typing in this computer to reply to something that made me angry. I sicken myself. Then I've realized just now that the middle class does not necessarily *not* want change, but it's just that they'd rather do something else. Oh we want change, but we just want something else *more*.

I was not really angry with the entry per se, blaming our oh so popular self-generalizations and deprecations. That just sickens me. Some, were actually hopeful. Like the student who [plans to distribute wealth among provinces by setting up internet cafes](http://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/ohvba/the_philippines_from_a_foreign_point_of_view/c3hnp21). I for one, am inspired by that. We need to nurture these ideas, because if we don't, no other class shares our want. Otherwise, do pray to all the gods that somehow the rich will be altruistic

In my humble opinion, I really think the Philippines would be better for it. :) 

Thanks for listening.

&gt;tl;dr version: (not in order) Ping is not reliable, use WinMTR instead of tracert, government needs public IX.

&gt;Hi all

&gt;I've read a lot of posts here on the forums

&gt;For a game such as LoL you have 4 layers of possible latency:

&gt;* 1) Consumer end (PC/Router/Bandwidth)
* 2) ISP
* 3) Interconnect/Transit
* 4) Server end (Servers

&gt;To measure latency end-to-end ICMP echo (PING) packets are not a reliable tool. There are many reasons for this but for us the main reason is that ICMP is a down prioritized packet type. Historically the ping tool was meant to see if a host was alive

&gt;On Windows 'tracert' uses ICMP echo requests to probe the route of the connection to your destination. If you do want to trace the route using ICMP echo I can recommend WinMTR as a replacement for tracert that is a lot faster and more accurate. WinMTR can be found here. The UNIX version has an option to do UDP based packets which is more relevant for us as UDP is usually used in online gaming because of reduced latency and overhead as compared to TCP.

&gt;In Europe the infrastructure and government laws are usually very good and the laws enforced. This means that the most common causes of latency is on the consumer end. People mostly have ADSL connections and forget they have something running in the background (seeding is the main culprit in most cases) as with ADSL when you saturate your uplink you obliterate your downlink. But here in Philippines there are a lot of other causes for latency for us gamers - the worst being PLDT - yes you read that right

&gt;PLDT (and SMART) are actively fighting interconnect laws here in the Philippines. This is done mostly because of the mobile market but internet (and thus gaming) suffers as a result. Because SMART (and with the purchase of Sun) has the dominant market share, they are essentially throttling the data exchange between the companies. This is against the law here in Philippines but as with a lot of other things here, money talks - morale walks. I assume you've experienced long delays on texting between Globe/SMART?

&gt;Here is a recent article on the problem.

&gt;Keep in mind that that interconnection is standard in other markets and I've never come across any other Telco being as manipulative towards their customers as PLDT/SMART.

&gt;So what does SMS delays have to do with LoL latency you ask? Well the biggest problem here is that by default PLDT routes all domestic traffic via an IX in HK. This means if you send data between a PLDT DSL subscriber and any other major ISP here it goes via a Hong Kong Internet eXchange. There is a law passed in Philippines that all ISPs have to interconnect freely via an Internet eXchange so data can flow freely between the customers of the ISPs. Mind you this does not mean that a Globe/Sky/Bayan/Eastern customer can access data/servers outside PLDTs network

&gt;ISPs buy transit traffic through backbone providers like PACNET, it's too expensive for all ISPs to run their own international backbone fibers.

&gt;Because of PLDTs enormous power they have been able to defy the laws of interconnection and because of this keep prices up and bandwidth down as a whole in Philippines. I'm not saying that the other Telcos here are angels but at least their obey the law of interconnection. Doesn't it seem odd that Philippines is so far behind in terms of bandwidth/price for internet? It's literally 10 year behind Europe in it's current state.

&gt;It's worth noting that Globe has a stake in the worlds most powerful sea fiber. This is why PLDT is scared that if they loose their stranglehold on the consumers here that they will realize that the competitor offers a superior product. Unfortunately Globe has some of the least educated support staff/customer service in Philippines so it's not all roses on the 'other side'.

&gt;I can give you a concrete example of how full PLDT is of themselves - I was involved in a project in Philippines (which is when I fell in love with the country and moved here afterwards) that also involved PACNET. I was dumbfounded why the routing in Philippines was all over the place, as they are the major operator it was important for us to have good connectivity with PLDT. The PACNET technician and the senior sales manager explained to me that of all the countries they do business in, Philippines was the only place where a Telco willing and carelessly broke conventional international norms. PACNET had been dumbfounded when PLDT asked PACNET to pay PLDT when PLDT wanted to buy backbone capacity from PACNET. Their reasoning was that without PLDT you could not service the general public in Philippines properly so that's why PLDT should get money for allowing their customers direct access to PACNET. I'll let that sink in a little.

&gt;PACNET is a company who's main business is SELLING backbone capacity across South East Asia and PLDT wanted PACNET to pay so PLDT could get backbone capacity from PACNET. It is so stupid that it completely blows my mind.

&gt;Everything else they explain perfectly matched what I had seen examining the Philippines' internet infrastructure. Unfortunately to remedy this situation you need non-corrupt representatives that also understands technology or the need for improving the infrastructure as a whole in Philippines - not being able to vote here was a relief as I doubt there are any.

&gt;To summarize:

&gt;Garena needs to supply us with an IP where we can do UDP based pings to have reliable connectivity diagnostics.

&gt;If Garena is relying solely on the standard connectivity at VITRO (ePLDT)

&gt;The Filipino government needs to create a unified IX

We are a small a nation that is part of Malaysia, and Malaysia. Our lands are being taken by West Malaysians, claimed by Tausug speaking rebels, yet no one has given a Sabahan a chance to trully voice his/her opinions.

I am a Dusun. I am indigenous to Sabah. My ancestors have never pledged allegiance to any foreign ruler prior to the British. I would like to ask /r/Philippines what they think of the whole Sabah claim and if you would like

***Disclaimer: my country kills children in Pakistan with unmanned drones. There are parts of my country that are extremely racist, and I want to scream.""

My kids have these friends who live in our condo. They're Koreans

Kevin and Arnold are typical Koreans. They get five hours of sleep a night and spend all of their time on weekdays studying, and stuff like that. They come from a culture where children literally worship their parents, even after their death, and parents are brutal, very critical of their children, make all of their decisions into adulthood, and are very strict.

Kevin and Arnold go to an international school and also spend a lot of time (on Saturdays) at our house. They see how Western families run. They realize that they're the only ones that have lives and parents like theirs. Arnold is in therapy because he has outbursts of physical violence. Kevin is really nice and doesn't have those

One day

-""I don't know. When they're not at school or doing homework

-""No. I mean how many hours do they have to study?""

-""As many as they need to do their homework. Then they play all day.""

-""That's not fair.""

-""Ok.""

-""They will be poor when they grow up.""

-""Americans raise their kids like this

Arnold looked at my like he might cry. I had just gently told him his life was a lie. It was a dumb thing to have said to the poor kid, and I reacted poorly.

Filipinos aren't like Koreans

Filipinos don't make their kids study and work all day like Korean, punish kids, humiliate kids, and one of my oldest son's teachers recently called him ""gay"" when she was angry. In the world I'm used to, a teacher would be sued and banned from teaching for life for that, (A) for using ""gay"" as an insult and (B) for trying to humiliate a kid.

I'm a professor. My students talk about loving their parents more than their future spouses

In America, why the hell would they treat me like a tyrant treats their peasant subjects?

The same thing seems to go for religion. The same thing seems to go for work. It definitely goes for education. The people not in authority unquestioningly spend all of their time and effort doing ridiculous stuff that doesn't make anyone happier, because they're told to. The people in authority feel no need to prove that anything (teaching methods, cosmetic procedures, meetings, whatever) is actually benefiting anyone, because they just expect to be obeyed, because obeying is somehow right.

So what does this mean for me

It bothers me because people can believe as I do and want what I do, we fell in love with someone here and wanted to drag them off with us to live on a beach in a polyamorous commune, and cultivate their soul and make them breakfast every morning and buy them paintbrushes or horses or whatever and help them live life as whatever it was they were born to be--whatever their soul was created for. It would be impossible. The person would say ""no, I have to do X,Y,Z and be A,B, because that's what the bosses told me. It doesn't matter that since I was a child I dreamed of [chess/obscure languages/whatever]. That's not my destiny. My destiny is to do what I'm told.""

So, are strangely difficult. And that's why I'm depressed.

Filipinos *need* access to contraception and sexual education. To clarify, living in America has made me respect the separation of church and state, my arguments for pro-life are not entirely religious. No disrespect meant towards them, but there are way too many people my age (even younger) and those not too much older than us who have had unplanned pregnancies. Kudos to them for not aborting them, but a lot of these teen mothers just leave their kids to their parents or yayas and continue to get wasted every Friday night.

I don’t think the Scripture is against contraception. I think the Pope is. You can’t pick and choose what parts of the Bible are true in order to favor your views. Yes, the verses “against” contraception are from the Old Testament. A lot of the rules in the Old Testament need to be understood in context. During biblical times, family lineage is most important. Women are devalued and their only purpose is to create children—nothing else. That’s why rapists were required to marry their victims; no one would marry a non-virgin, so she is given a husband, etc.

So many of these “rules” are no longer followed in modern society because we’re just that—modern society. It’s against these rules to wear different kinds of fabrics at the same time, and proper contraception is good. In my opinion, sex outside of marriage is wrong. Yes, the Bible also says that, but to me, it’s also because in the event of an unplanned pregnancy, you’re not mature enough to care for a child (especially when you’re just out partying). Being a bastard myself, their baby shower gifts were sex toys when baby shower gifts are supposed to be diapers, etc.

Also, not just avoiding unplanned babies. The birth control has a lot of health benefits for women (period stuff, skin stuff, etc).

Overpopulation is a BAD thing. Overpopulation = poverty. China “makes everything” because of cheap labor (yes

The RH Bill is not a “HEY LET ME SHOVE THIS IN YOUR FACE DO THIS DO THAT ETC” deal. It’s free choice.

Condoms are NOT the cause of the spread of AIDS (see what happens when you lack sex education?). They actually prevent the spread of sexually transmitted diseases.

The RH Bill is still *against* abortion. What the bill proposes would actually decrease the need for it. Please explain to me how this is “against human life.”

How this works: 

* Submit and upvote as many logos as you want. The one with the most upvotes will be used.

* To make the voting easier and more precise

* File size: The default header image is 120x40. The modified version can be of any dimension or file size

* Last day for submissions and voting will be on the **21st of this month**.

* Mods reserve the right to pick the next most upvoted submission if they find the winning submission inappropriate, NSFS, or just generally offensive ಠ_ಠ

Not gonna downplay it. I'm a football fan and a supporter of the Philippine football team. I'm also very familiar with the rotten side of journalism for TV in this country. 

I don't know anything about the Christy Ramos sexual harassment case because I wasn't there. I personally think it's a misunderstanding that Ramos *should* have taken up with Federation first

But that's not what bothers me so much about this video. I can't believe someone like Arnold Clavio is allowed to say something like ""**Hindi naman kayo kayumanggi. Hindi kayo Pilipino.**"" on national TV.

Whatever you wanna call his spiel, he's not the only one who feels this way. 

I know there are a lot people out there who don't think half-Filipinos are true Filipinos. I feel like the only way to address this is to *talk about it*. 

I don't know if anyone's up for it

P.S. Sorry mods

**EDIT:** I love how this post has taken off. I just want to ask everybody an additional question - do you guys think the Philippine Football Team is Filipino?

1359109946.0,17902y,I'm Chinoy but there are aspects of my society that I have a hard time dealing with [Rant of sorts],floatinglotus,40,8,119,"I'm pure Chinese but I used the term Chinoy for convenience's sake. I grew up in a traditional Chinese family that lived in Binondo and I studied in a Chinese school until college. I'd rather not reveal what college I went to

In college, I feel that I've gone a long way compared to before. Spending some time studying abroad also helped.

Ever since, particularly the older generation. Those who are around my age (I'm in my mid-20s, so I mean those slightly older/younger than I am) are mostly fine, but there are many traditional values that I have difficulty accepting/dealing with.

Basically, while the young ones are hesitant and scared to disrupt the status quo (and, unfortunately, we can't really blame them). I don't know if it's just the elders that I've been exposed to, but I find that many of the elders are very bigoted. Namely:

1. They're racist (especially when it comes to romantic relationships with Pinoys, particularly Pinoys, is due to racism that they (the Chinese) have been subjected to in the past, as well as kidnapping and other incidents of Sinophobia, Sinophobia has largely decreased these days, and people with misconceptions towards Chinoys seem to be more ignorant than hateful, so I feel that it's unfair to look down on all Pinoys and foreigners because a few bad apples ruined it for everyone.

2. They're sexist - I often get crap that basically amounts to ""act like Maria Clara because you're a girl; proper girls don't do [whatever they find unladylike]""). Also, because if I get too intelligent and liberal, I will make men insecure. Generally, their outlooks towards women and men have this underlying implication that men that aren't family are perverts, and that women are delicate flowers that should be sheltered and protected.

3. They always think they're right, they'll just tell you to listen to them just because. IMHO, older people don't always know better. I appreciate getting advice and guidance, but when they always put younger people down and try to override other people's thoughts, I think that's too much.

4. They're homophobic - I get that it's too much of a stretch for them to be pro-same-sex marriage, which makes me feel really bad for my homosexual Chinese friends.

5. They're really materialistic - Seems like they only care about making money; many really don't give a crap about social progress. Heck

6. They're hypocritical, ""Does s/he come from a rich family?"" If the answer is no, they think, ""S/he's not good enough!""

7. They're too controlling and overprotective of their children, etc. will increase if I do. Also, I know some parents that have got their kids' lives planned out to the very last detail - note that these kids are in their 20s. In a way, one can infer here that Chinese parents think of their children as investments, meant to take care of them and to do what the parents want them to do. Deviating from what the parents want automatically means that a child is ungrateful and arrogant.

8. They're very distrustful of generally everyone and everything. My parents like to tell me that I shouldn't really have many friends, if one is to be distrustful of everyone, what's the point of socialization or marriage?

9. Herd mentality/shame culture - Chinoy elders are not the least bit shy about meddling in others' affairs. Relatives, Chinoys are really afraid of what their friends/the community will say. It's frustrating that they seem to value their honor than standing up for what really matters. 

(I'll edit this list when I can think of more things.)

Again, growing up, have been drastically different from ours. But I feel that respect is a two-way street, so I'm saddened that many of the elders I know cannot seem to respect the changing times and younger people, what with their trying to force their views on others. I envy how most Pinoys and foreigners I know don't experience these things all that much, if at all. One of the few Pinoys I know (not personally) who has to deal with crap like this (if showbiz reports are any indication) is Sarah Geronimo.

I know that my thoughts can be rather unpopular and unpleasant-sounding, many of those with first-gen parents have more or less similar experiences) but Pinoys/Chinoys seem rather hesitant to bring this up. Any fellow Chinoys with insights to share? Pinoys and other non-Chinese, I'd love to hear your thoughts as well. 

**Edited to add:** Gave more examples to clarify my points

Also, I admire the typical Chinoy work and study ethic, and Chinoys' responsibility when it comes to handling money (i.e. their ability to make money grow). I also do think that it's good that Chinoys generally want their children to be achievers or, at least, more than an average Joe/Jane, provided that they don't take this pursuit to extremes. I also acknowledge that Pinoy culture/society isn't perfect, either, while Chinoys are usually hailed as a model minority. I started this post partly out of frustration and partly to start some discourse.

I'll reply to your responses tomorrow, but I often get shamed, shot down, and insulted for being different. Years of putting up with this culture has killed my self-esteem, so I can't help but crack at times.

**Thanks for all the replies! I'm surprised that this post got a lot of replies, so I'll reply to a few posts at a time, starting with the shorter ones.**",,False,,t5_2qjov,,http://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/17902y/im_chinoy_but_there_are_aspects_of_my_society/
1358492666.0,16t0fg,"Instead of educating people about Balut by daring them to try it or saying it is like a Viagra, Balut should be presented for what it is, a series of complex textures and flavors. ",anis9,40,35, and rotten tofu. Russia has beluga caviar. France has cheese and truffles. In the Philippines we have our goat cheese

Things I tell my friends who have never tried it:

1. The broth inside. It's basically a duck and yolk pressure cooked in its own juices

2. The yolk is soft and is different from any yolk you've ever tasted. The yolk itself has the essence of duck all over it. 

3. The body or chick, chef's say the flavor of that fish is concentrated in that eyeball. Try eating salmon head or bangus head sinigang, the eyes are the best part. Eating the balut chick is similar to eating the eye of a fish. It's gooey, soft, a little boney, but has the concentrated flavor of the duck in such a small thing. When it's more developed, it even has meat in it which makes the proteins taste better.

  If you don't like fish eyes, face, tripe, and other innards then you probably will not appreciate these flavors. You should try stuff other than plain meat. Respect the slaughtered animal, use all of it and eat most of it. The flavors and textures are amazing if prepared correctly.

4. The calcium or rock. This is like the ""rice"" of the meal. You take a few bites of this while eating the other textures and flavors. Conio's throw this away

Why do you love or hate balut? :)

It's geared towards ordinary families in Metro-Manila with an aim to give Philippine-centric information on how we can prepare for emergencies.

This means that it's *not* one of those hard core 'end of times' survivalists sites. Rather

Another important aspect to the site is that it's geared towards families helping themselves. Much of the discussion in the media focuses on what needs to be done on a governmental level; there's little advice about what we as individuals can do to prepare. 

Further, people were waiting for a week or more and when help came, it was in the form of politicians and movie stars trying to get media exposure.

The main message behind the site is basically that we can have a more resilient city by preparing our own households.

So anyways

I find the Philippine Star boring. And their website sucks (but is has improved lately).

Manila Bulletin - I don't even bother. 

ABS-CBN / GMA 7 - I somehow don't bother checking their news sites. 

ANC - Sometimes I check their Facebook page. 

Get Real Philippines - Depressing site. All they do is rant and rave against Filipinos. And they seem to be overly hostile to people who disagree with them. They aren't only disagreeing....they're disagreeable.

1368341699.0,1e68q9,I need help dealing with overbearing Chinoy family members.,floatinglotus,27,7,51,"Hi again



You probably remember me from [my post on what I perceive to be the ills of Chinoy society](http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/17p7rn/25f_im_a_filipino_chinese_based_in_the/). Well, while I've gotten a bit more desensitized to the point that I don't cry in front of my folks anymore, it still doesn't mean I'm okay.



I'll try my best to do this without revealing as many personal details as possible, so I might not be able to reply as often, though.



Anyway


**Background** 


I'm the oldest child, is overbearing and controlling. My dad grew up with a domineering mother, and all of his siblings grew up basically being brainwashed by their mother, and thinking that the way they were raised and their relationship with one another (they're overly attached, such that only my dad got married) is the hallmark of a healthy, respectful, traditional Chinese family, they think they have a say in our lives. It really does not help that they are uber-conservative and don't go out often. Other than working (for the family business)


Since I was the first child to be born to their side, my parents and relatives weren't sure what to expect from me, but I exceeded their expectations. Since I was shy and quiet, and I got good grades, they always saw me as a model child. I thought that they'd eventually be less overprotective and trust me more. Boy, was I wrong.



**After college and until now**



To sum up our clashes, refusing to believe that maybe they don't know as much as they think they do. They believe that the traditional Chinese way is the best and only way to live life.



I graduated from college with good grades (and honors, smoke, or party - I have a bit of a dirty mind thanks to some of the things I've read, but that's about it). But my folks didn't cut me any slack.



Just now, there were several other times in the past few years. No matter how much I plead for him to talk calmly and to talk to me like an equal, nothing happens, because he insists that I'm a child.



This would be even longer than it should if I were to list all the BS he's given me



* Despite generally being a good kid, worse, have a non-Chinese BF whom I truly love, I am an embarrassment, never mind what I've achieved in school and at work.



* He cannot accept that I have different views, and everyone answers to only one boss, which is him.



* I said that just because I make decisions that he doesn't like (and they're not even glaringly bad/evil decisions - I just dared to have non-Chinese friends and a non-Chinese BF, it doesn't mean we can't love or respect each other. He said that he knows that, but who cares about that? I should just listen to him, **because.** 



* He said that there are many things I can't achieve in life because I'm Chinese and I'm a woman, unless money-making is involved (which is why he keeps pushing me towards money-making industries even though he knows where I can truly flourish). He often belittles my mom and says he doesn't have to listen to her all the time because she's not the head of the household, and that doing this is okay because it's part of the Fil-Chi tradition. (And sadly, it really is, for many traditional households. Worse, my mom doesn't have much of a problem with that treatment. Both parents are of the opinion that you don't need love to make a marriage work. As long as you have a lot of food, clothing, and money



* I said that while I'm not a radical feminist, are what actually made me realize that I do not want to marry a Chinoy. I know that the younger generation is generally better, but if I will have to put up with relatives who think and act like my folks and relatives, I will just go insane. Dad said that my line of thinking is wrong and selfish, not to mention symptomatic of the ills of today's generation (he thinks individualism = selfishness).



* I have been threatened with disownment since January 2013. My dad hasn't actually done it, because if I suffer humiliation and persecution, I was asking for it. He said he doesn't believe in unconditional love (despite seeming to want me to unconditionally love him), and that he won't take me back if I stumble. It scared me a bit, but right now, I feel motivated to accept his challenge and be successful if he does kick me out (and even if he doesn't, I want to be successful for my own sake



* In relation to being successful, I'll be giving away my identity.) He says I'll only be successful if I listen to him. In his words (I kid you not), ""I may make mistakes sometimes, but I always know best!"" (It's a sentiment that mom echoes sometimes.) He equates success with being filthy rich, and he doesn't care that I'm okay with not being filthy rich. What's important to me is to live a middle- to upper middle-class lifestyle, and with my finances and current job, I know that I can do it. Even with some other job with a lower pay



* Dad has been emotionally manipulating me. The relatives don't know about the BF yet, and that he shouldn't see it that way, but he insists on seeing it that way. (On a related note, he even used Heart Evangelista and Sarah Geronimo as examples, the former being a bad daughter and the latter being a good daughter for him.)



* The relatives have already shown that they're only capable of being happy for me and loving me if it doesn't take too much effort. They love giving me material things, mainly, possibly bringing home a foreign husband.



* The only people my dad and relatives see as valid source of advice/opinions are people who think like them. In short, not only will I be ostracized, but they will also be ostracized. 



* The shame and humiliation they say they'll get from these people is why my dad says he will someday disown me if I toe the line too much. So in short



* With the help of a tattletale sibling who's on their side, but there were times when - sorry, my fault - I got negligent and slipped up. They've dug up chat logs with my BF. In some of them, I was making dirty in-jokes with him, which offended them, and, in others, but my BF kept making jokes and innocuous comments to diffuse my anger. (Sorry, but if I don't vent, then of course I need to seek support from others. Previously




* The weirdest thing: they keep thinking that going to church will help fix my ills and make me a better person. Ironically, even. I'm not an atheist; I'm just a non-practicing Catholic (I think Jesus is awesome, but many of his followers these days just ruin things for everyone). But if I'm to start going to church, I'd rather go to church with people who aren't religious hypocrites. Just this morning, they kept bugging me to go, and even threatened to ground me and put me under house arrest if I refused to go.



I just don't really know how to deal with them anymore. I'm at my wits' end. I just try not to think about these things often, I feel that it's an uneasy peace - that there's no telling when they'll blow up again and take offense to this or that. I don't get why I'm the bad daughter just because I'm more individualistic and I know what I want in life. Meanwhile, my siblings who can't think or decide for themselves (tattletale sibling's already in college yet always has to consult my folks for decisions) are praised for being better siblings because they're more obedient. As my dad said, ""You may be mellow and kind-hearted, but you're still not a good daughter and you're a disappointment because you're not obedient.""



I wish I could move out but they really won't let me do it. Moving out is really easier said than done in the Philippines, but I want to return. I'd like to think that after a few years abroad, my relationship with the folks might improve, but the way things just seem to keep getting worse... I don't know.



What advice can you give to me? Are there any psychologists, too!), but I don't get to see him all that often because he lives far away and is busy. And I can't keep bugging my friends about this all the time because it'll just stress them out.



Your insights will be much appreciated! Also

I was genuinely confused and angry, in America of all places! The teen angst faded after a few months, but I was really proud to be Filipino. Everyone couldn't believe I came straight from the Philippines, because I didn't have the heavy fob accent. It was a really awkward transition socially, because cultural norms here and there are prominently different. But if there's one thing I made sure you knew, it's that I was Filipino.

Then

But it was far from it. They didn't know at all. They were sheltered. They grew up here. They couldn't relate to my experiences. What really irked me was how they were proud to be Filipino. I couldn't process how you could claim to be Filipino without knowing how to speak Tagalog. How could you be Filipino when you haven't even been there? Do you know how deep of a meaning the word ""barkada"" has and how it simply just isn't your friends? Sure, but you don't know what it really is to be Filipino. You are Filipino-American.

So I came to resent Filipino-Americans. I can't explain it but it's some sort of secret club mentality. I always view them as an outsider from our culture no matter how hard they try to assimilate and learn every single detail. Unless you grew up in the Philippines

Even though I grew up in the Philippines, I had a vision of how I'd turn out to be. If I were to come face to face with that kid, he probably won't identify with me at all, let alone recognize me. After graduating from university and doing all sorts of crazy shit I never would've done, I came to realize how America has warped my outlook on life. My years and experiences here have shaped me into who I am today, and I would never trade it for anything. Not even to go back in time and stay in the Philippines.

Which brings me to my problem - I do not identify with anyone. 

I am not American. Even though I am a citizen

I am not Filipino-American. You have an idea of my culture

The hardest part for me to accept is my attitude towards Filipinos, and antagonistic attitude towards life in general. A lot of people do not realize their capacity to think for themselves and break the norm. The general outlook is “People around me do this, therefore I will do the same. Bahala na si batman”. An example of this would be the recent controversy with the RH bill. If I grew up in the Philippines, I know for a fact that I would actually support that bill. But after living here, it's quite clear that voting no on this means you are a citizen who does not want progress in your country. Everyone drags everyone else down, no one likes to see his neighbor doing better than him. Especially here in America. A lot of fellow Filipinos will praise you if you are a self-made man, but for some reason scorn you for ""putting on airs"". “Ang yabang naman nyan, galing din naman sa pinas”. If I worked for my money, since we have nothing to relate with each other except the early hayskul days.

Nowadays, only because I have a Chinese last name. I don't even get excited like I used to when I meet someone who's actually from the Philippines. Sometimes I even feel embarrassed. If I know you speak both English and Tagalog, I'd rather talk to you in English.

This will probably get a lot of hate

We called the police station to report it, but we didn't have any other information except where we were and that we heard a woman screaming.

We heard a siren go by a few minutes after we made the call. Not sure where the sound came from (within the hotel or nextdoor). What else can we do? Don't really want to venture outside to look

This may be part of the culture but it seems my office mates are always looking for someone to treat them to food. I know it is common to treat other on your birthday here but they are not shy about asking or expecting to receive something. Even if it is not someone birthday but they received some extra money for a promotion or whatever it may be it seems they think they are entitled to some part of it.

I am an American living in the Philippines for about the past two years and have a girlfriend here in the Philippines. Whenever I fly back to the states I am constantly asked for pasalubong. from my officemates, people that I wouldn't even consider friends?

In another instance my gfs family also expects alot from her because she is dating me. She has helped them financially and I also understand that is part of the culture, etc (non necessary items) for her sister. Recently her dad asked her if I would sponsor his futbol team. Why? I don't know because I don't have a business. They think I am very well off, which I am not, but even if I was I don't think I should be expected to give them money. 

Don't get me wrong I love the country and the people but this has started to bother me more and more and has just been awkward for me. It also scares me that my gfs family will be taking much of her salary so she will not be able to save for her/our future. Does anyone else have experience with this?

Shared Spreadsheet:

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AnevhsqBNJoudElfX2xCSElFTGNHRWFKUGhOaW52ZWc&amp;usp=sharing

How to update the spreadsheet (Est. Time: 3 minutes):

1) Name-Initials : You only need to enter the initials of your/your friend's name. 

2) Education Info:  

Academic Competency - Write Average/Good based on the marks received during college. Excellent is only for the graduates with honors or board top notchers. Bad is for those who were just lucky to graduate.

School is optional info. Year Graduated is required.

3) Jobs from Year 1 to 10 after graduation: Generic job titles please. Junior Draftsman &amp; Senior Draftsman can just be submitted as 'Drafstman'.

4) Job Misc Info: Indicate monthly earnings (Annual Earning/13mos.)

5) Remarks: can be about educ or job info. It can be also an explanation if there are years without work. 

A few redditors' participation will be awesome, I'd wish we can get like 30+ different career paths for 20 different courses, and with more additional info, and I could share the info to the school of my niece which they can use for career counseling.

This is a publicly shared document. Any kind of information that we will ultimately collect can be used by anyone for whatever purpose.

**Update 2:** I was at the box. No one showed up at the facility/distribution point to fix anything today

**Update:** Their new response to me saying ""I've contacted NTC and DTI to complain. Please explain why you don't have replacement cables ready for broken lines and why this took 1 month."" is -
""We're now fixing the problem. We have dispatched repairmen."" Fucking assholes going around the question. I'm heading to the box where they plan to fix the wires. 

-----------------------------------------------------

Our Globe internet has been down for close to a month. I've called tech support 25 times and they say that the escalation team says ""There were cables stolen and we don't know when we can restore service."" They shouldn't have offered service if they don't have provisions to replace cables

I've tried going to business centers

They would send an escalation email to the tech team supervisors asking ""Sirs

Their only reply, almost daily) to email them and demand a real explanation, a timetable, and they would ignore.

Here's the thing. I know where the main distribution/facility (where the said cables are stolen or being fixed) point is. I have friends who check on the area regularly and they tell me that no van or globe repair has come to even survey the place. I have reason to believe that laziness and complacency is the main reason we don't have internet for a month. I now have a petition signed by our village to complain.

I'm tired as fuck. How do I get these people in trouble for being unprofessional and not having a timetable for a solution. Everyday they delay

I have a home business that's losing money daily because of their incompetence. No one is accountable. They hide behind CSR's and emails and generic responses. I've had enough but they are the only available internet service in the area.

Do you guys know where I can find a physical address for the Globe Dasma branch? Not the business center in the mall but the actual office where the vans come from. I plan to complain there and bring my list of signatures from hundreds of people.

I fully understand that the phone CSR's are there to receive complaints and document them. The supervisors are there to escalate. The problem isn't with the people answering the phones,,False,,t5_2qjov,1350556584.0,,True

One thing that I couldn't figure out was ""**apir**"". I thought it came from *appear*, of all people. I was watching a scene in HIMYM where he was trying to get high fives, and he said, ""Up here!"" and ""Down low!"" That was just a eureka moment for me: **UP HERE --&gt; apir**.

A little background about myself: I'm an American studying anthropology and history. I try to read whatever I can about the history of the Philippines, makes a similar point to the one I've seen in various comments sections before. The author states that her work studying indigenous clothing strives to disprove the apparently popular belief that the pre-Hispanic Filipinos were ""naked, dirty and illiterate"".

Now it's very obvious for me as someone who has access to historical records from the Spanish era and beyond that this belief is false. Not only did many indigenous Filipino groups wear very intricate clothing (many still do), including [*Doctrina Christiana*](http://www.gutenberg.org/files/16119/16119-h/16119-h.htm) in 1593. This is also similar to what the Jesuits did in Mexico from the mid 1500's until they were expelled from New Spain (Philippines, Mexico, Central America, and parts of South America) by order of the King of Spain for apparently growing too close to the indigenous populations and threatening colonial loyalty to the Crown.

tl;dr I don't know what the situation in schools now is like because I'm a foreigner but the historical evidence points towards a very ""civilized"" (assuming that term actually has meaning in a comparative sense) pre-Hispanic Filipino population

I checked out the food he dropped and it just looked like some dirty rice.

Another time, like I was completely helpless stuck in the back of the car.

I start at home. I talk to my younger siblings about safe sex (because our parents and their school do not wish to talk about it), without judgement. Even offered to buy them condoms. 

I told my sister that in the event that sex presents itself, if they both agree, then practice safe sex. She also has the risk of getting pregnant so it is really important that she knows this as early as 15.

Gaming:

Laptop:
I currently am ready to replace my laptop with something cheap, as I do worry about it getting stolen, breaking, failing, etc. I am ready to go for a $249 Samsung Chromebook for my basic needs, but I do worry about being able to connect to the internet with it with a SIM card. There are 3G Samsung Chromebooks, but will it be compatible with a Filipino carrier? This also may not be an issue if I use mobile broadband on my phone

Internet:
I would like to have internet access on my desktop, will those SIM cards be compatible with a Chromebook? Or should I simply mobile hotspot on an Android device with SIM card load? Which leads me to... 

Phone: I am currently on USA Verizon with a Samsung S3, make occasional phone calls, and use the internet for e-mail as well as for my laptop, if possible.
