Please excuse the double post- I didn't know the proper place for this to go. 

- - - - -

hello folks!  I'm going on tour this  year from October through
Feb.  I'll be all over the goddamn place.  This year
something new
selling my content online.  We are selling tickets to this tour
exclusively here on louisck.com.  I only wanted to do this if
there was a way
bring the price of tickets down and make them easier and less
complicated to buy.  We figured out a way.

Making my shows affordable has always been my goal but two things
have always worked against that.  High ticket charges and ticket
re-sellers marking up the prices.  Some ticketing services charge
more than 40% over the ticket price and
I've made my ticket prices
up

By selling the tickets exclusively on my site
ticket charges way down and absorbed them into the ticket price.
To buy a ticket
buy the damn thing.   opt in to the email list if you want
you'll only get emails from me.

Also
anything above the original price
your ticket (and refund your money).  this is something I intend
to enforce.  There are some other rules you may find annoying but
they are meant to prevent someone who has no intention of seeing
the show from buying the ticket and just flipping it for twice
the price from a thousand miles away.

Some of these rules may be a pain in your ass
patient.  My goal here is that people coming to see my shows are
able to pay a fair price and that they be paying just for a
ticket.  Not also paying an exhorbanant fee for the privalege of
buying a ticket.

Tickets across the board
what you'll actually pay.  In every case
anyone has actually  paid to see me (after ticket charges)  in
about two years and in most cases it's about half of what you
paid last year.

The benifit for me is that I won't get angry emails from anyone
who paid a ton of money to see me due to circumstances out of my
control.  That makes me VERY happy.  The 45 dollars also includes
sales tax
depending on the state.

Another benifit to me is also one to you.  I get your email
address (if you opt in) when you opt in.  You don't have to join
ANYTHING to buy these tickets and if you opt in
from me once in an old man's jizz-cycle.

Obviously  none of this means anything if the shows aren't good.
So that's up to me.  As I do every year
brand new hour (or more) on all of these shows.

Lastly
that could work with our exclusive ticketing service under these
perameters.  It means I'm playing in very new places.  I really
appreciate all of these theaters that are letting us give this a
try.

Setting up this tour has been fascinating and difficult.  this
ticketing service is a brand new thing and I really fucking hope
it works and that there aren't any problems.  If anything comes
up

Doing things this way means I""m making less than I would have
made if I did a standard tour
expensive ticketing service.  In some cities I've had to play
smaller venues and do more shows.  But I like doing more shows
and about a year ago I reached a place where I realized I am
making enough money doing comedy so the next thing that
interested me is bringing your price down.  Either way
make a whole lot more than my grandfather who taught math and
raised chickens in Michigan.

alright
folks on the opt-in list and sending a separate email that lays
it out much more simply with the proper links.  I am doing this
because when I emailed you about LIVE AT CARNEGIE HALL
still on sale for 5 dollars!) about half of the people who got
the email really enjoyed the long
The other half HATED it and would have preffered a price
and me shutting the fuck up.

This way
massive shit-ball of text and throw it in the garbage
on the simple email.

I hope to see you all on the road.

regards

Nancy and I put our brushes down and turn to her, and the young woman continues, ""I don't WORK for Make-A-Wish.  I'm a client.   I'm here because this was my wish, on your show.""

And then what do you say?  We nodded and went back to work and after a few minutes of silence

She didn't even pause, not the GOOD leukemia..."" and she kept right on painting as if she were completely unaware that she had just changed our lives.

We finished up the room, they always do.

Tonight I'm hosting Saturday Night Live

I've been working here all week with the cast, and with Lorne Michaels. Such a great and talented group of people.

And here we are in the middle of New York City, so much difficulty and trauma, which everyone here is still dealing with every day.

Last night we shot some pre-tape segments in greenwich Village

Its pretty impossible to describe walking through these city streets in total darkness.  It can't even be called a trip through time, gas lamps, candlelight, kerosene.  But this was pitch black, street after street, corner round corner. And for me, the village being the very place that made me into a comedian and a man, in a way

This is how a lot of the city is still.  I know people in queens, new jersey, all over, are not normal yet.  And not normal is hard.

And here at 30 rock

In about 5 hours we'll be going on the air.   I'll do a monologue.  And we'll show you some sketches that we wrote and try to make you laugh.   I'm gonna look really dumb in some of this stuff.  But I don't care. Its awfully worth it. And I'm really excited.

Anyway.  I just wanted to let you know.  If you watch the show tonight

Thanks.

Louis C.K.

This is the general data:

Confirmed sex (either by strong innuendo or plain admission) = 1. 
Unconfirmed sex (e.g.

* Chandler: 10.5 sex partners
* Ross: 14 sex partners
* Monica: 14.5 sex partners
* Rachel: 15.5 sex partners
* Phoebe: 32.5 sex partners
* Joey: 51.5 sex partners

Some trivia:

* In episode 22 of Season 2 (""The One with the Two Parties"")
* Joey and Ross have taken part in threesomes. (EDIT: As several redditors pointed out, the universe isn't going to implode.)
* Season 6 was definitely the quietest sex-wise. **Only 4.5 new sex partners** are discovered.
* During Season 1
* Chandler holds the record for LESS new partners discovered continuously. After having sex with Monica (end of Season 4), we discover in episode 11 of Season 7 (""The One with All the Cheesecakes"") that she had had sex with Stuart, her cousin's new husband.
* Phoebe surpasses Joey in new sex partners' discoveries in 4 seasons (1

Enjoy!

**TL;DR: I've carried out a profound study on Friends' sex life and sharing some info makes me feel less of a moron.**

EDIT: Wow, of course. Comment cells in grey indicate ""unconfirmed sex"" (or ""half sex"", the term I used in the spreadsheet). The second tab or sheet (named ""stats per season"" is exactly that: a summary of the data but in numeric form, per season. It includes the graph, of course.

Enjoy!

EDIT 2: Well

Here are some links posted by redditors:

The fact that you folks continue to foist crappy gimmicks on us only proves you hold us in contempt and find us to be stupid.

Still, you're losing others too.

EDIT: A lot of great responses (even most of the negative ones). To clarify

And while I realize it's not a new phenomenon

EDIT #2: Numerous folks have made a point throughout this thread that the marketing philosophy is people won't go see a film unless they know what it's about..

1. I think the trip they embarked on was all of 120 miles or something like that. And the radiator hose breaks. Again. I have had 6 cars and they have come and gone for numerous reasons. I have never had a radiator hose ""break"" that I know of. This thing breaks every other show. 

2. It broke while going slow through the stopped cars. They couldn't take an alternate route because they were too low on gas. Again wasn't this just a 120 mile trip? 

3. Crossbow guy wants a motorcycle - cool. But how loud a bike do you really want to be driving? 

4. Only one guy goes on the roof to watch for zombies. Somehow he only sees them when they are right on the group. 

5. No signal system to alert the others.

6. Black guy has wandered way up ahead. Almost kills himself as he... tries to sit down? 

7. Kids are ""exploring"". In a zombie-infested world. The kids are exploring. ""Stay where I can see you honey..."". How about ""stay tied to my back""?

8. Zombies can't smell all these humans and walk on by for the most part.

9. The blond in the RV tries to assemble a gun that she doesn't know how to assemble

10. Zombie sees the girl and chases. One guy runs off to help her? One? The mom doesn't run along also? 

11. The mom doesn't join the first search. Just a couple guys. 

12. The next day they set out *with the sun high in the sky*. Really you guys slept in with a little girl missing? They get into some big debate about giving blond her gun or not. Again

13. They go looking for her single file. They aren't spread out whatsoever to maximize their search.

14. Disable church megaphone rather than calling the girl on it. After 24 hours don't you just go all out and risk attracting zombies to find her?

15. Oh now let's stop and pray. How dumb would the mom feel if they arrived 10 seconds too late to save her daughter

15. Now let's talk about the affair we had. 

16. Now let's talk about running away.

17. Now the sheriff needs to pray. No rush.

18. More debate over giving blond a gun. 

19. Ooh a deer. Go ahead kid, shot the deer right at that moment and the bullet went right through and hit you. What are the odds.

Update:

* In case you're wondering what's new. The dailyshow moved to Hulu entirely. thedailyshow.com is now served trough the hulu player from their own site (it wasn't until the day before yesterday).
* I know about torrents
* The X-Forwarded-For hack is known to me
* The Dailyshow used to be proud of the fact that others abroad watched it
* The suggestions about how to circumvent the broken industrial-entertainment complex are welcome. But please also consider the rammifications. A **lot** of people don't know how to torrent or tweak their HTTP headers, right? It makes me sad :/
* I know I sound like a lazy bastard, me fixing it for me, won't fix it for anybody else, or indeed, the majority of people who should happen to stumble upon thedailyshow.com.
