[Your Feedback Matters](http://news.xbox.com/2013/06/update)

---

I'm sick of seeing all the misinformation going around the gaming subreddits. It's really frustrating to see people furiously hating the X1 without having all

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To start off

**USED GAMES**

One of the X1's main feature is the ability to install the disc directly to the hard drive and play it without a disk. Correct me if I'm wrong

Contrary to popular believe

""Trade-in and resell your disc-based games: Today, or consumers for enabling transfer of these games.""

What can we take away from this? Easy. If you bought a disc based game, you will not be able to do this. 

***FIRST PARTY GAMES***

""In our role as a game publisher, but we are exploring the possibilities with our partners.""

All first party games will be allowed to be resold and be given away (more of this below). 

***RENTING GAMES***

""Loaning or renting games won’t be available at launch

Microsoft and companies such as Gamefly are working on a system to make this work. 

---------------------------

**DRM--WHY?**

As we saw above

This is why the 24-hour check is required. Without this

The drawback to this is not being able to game offline. Microsoft has said that the final decisions to this issue have not been final. I believe if they allow you to play offline with the disc in the disc tray

-----------------------

**PRIVACY**

This is one of the biggest things people have been complaining about. Microsoft has already addressed the issue

""You are in control of when Kinect sensing is On, just say “Xbox Off.” When the system is off, it’s only listening for the single voice command -- “Xbox On,” and you can even turn that feature off too. Some apps and games may require Kinect functionality to operate, so you’ll need to turn it back on for these experiences.""

As I've stated before, you can also do that. 

If you want to learn more about the Kinect's privacy settings

-----------------------

**XBOX ONE- A GAME OF CIRCLES**

Now onto the other things. As some of us know, that will be able to access your game library from anywhere (in the same region, I'm assuming..still not clear about this) at anytime (as long as you or someone else in your circle isn't playing it). This is of course how things work now, two of your friends can't play the game at the same time from one disc on two separate consoles. 

This is a feature that is absolutely wonderful

""Give your family access to your entire games library anytime, they will see not just Forza, but all of your shared games. You can always play your games, and any one of your family members can be playing from your shared library at a given time.""

I absolutely love this feature. For example

*Important Update:* New information has risen relating to this feature. You +1 friend from your circle can play the same game at the same time. Others can still play from your other library selection. 

[SOURCE]( https://mobile.twitter.com/nowak911/status/345297685743534080)

*Another Important Update:* DLC will be shareable through your circle. Your friend will be able to play all of the DLC that you buy. They will not need to purchase their own DLC for the game they're playing from your Xbox One. 

[SOURCE](http://i.imgur.com/PMx0p38.jpg)

-------------------------------------------------

**GIVING AWAY GAMES**

Do you have a game that you will no longer play? Your friend can still play it off of your Xbox (if they're in your circle). What if they're not? As long as they have been in your friend's list for 30 days

*Disclaimer: Microsoft has left it up to the publishers to decide whether or not you will be able to give your games to your friend. As stated above

------------------------------------

**AFTER-THOUGHT: ADDITIONAL INFORMATION**

The big change in the Xbox Live system is the feature to allow all users on one console to have gold by just one user having it. For example

In short

----------------------------------

**AFTER-THOUGHT OF AN AFTER-THOUGHT

*Disclaimer

The main question I'm seeing is why the Kinect is being forced upon us. This is what I believe is the case in relation to this matter. 

The past version of the Kinect was not the big leap in innovating that Microsoft wanted. It is a powerful machine

Why weren't developers making games for the Kinect? Was it because they couldn't?

***A CHANGE OF MARKETS***

If a developer made a game for the Kinect, but to retailers. Which means that there are Kinects in the shelves or warehouses that will never reach the individual customer. In comparison, the 360 has sold an estimated 77.2 million units, again not all sold to invidual customers, but it's safe to assume that there a lot more 360's in the hand of an individual customer than there is Kinects. In an instant, your market shrinks to about 31% of the possible market. Keep in mind, this number will change depending on how many units of each product have been sold to each consumer. 

With that information given to you, I'm thinking Microsoft is ensuring the developers that the market is out there! In this move, Microsoft want the developers to explore the possibilities of the Kinect. They want newer innovations as they believe they've made a product with enormous potential. Why do you believe they were shoving the Kinect down everyone's throat last E3? They wanted to expand their market. 

Just think of everything that can be developed for the Kinect. For example, innovation.


As to why it can't be disconnected

     * They often are associated with a Game DVR capture to show your friends that you are better than they are.
     * Developers can release more of them after the game’s initial release (more on that in a bit).
  * Differences:
     * **Challenges are time based.** As just noted

     * **Challenges do not give out Gamerscore.** We want everyone to have the same shot at increasing their Gamerscore to its highest potential. Since challenges are intentionally temporary (an opportunity) and achievements never expire (a promise)

     * **Challenges may cross titles

     * **Challenges can be unlocked by the community.** Community challenges are typically goals that exceed what a lone player can accomplish in the given period of time. Imagine
  * Achievements run on the cloud
     * Allows Developers to run challenges across all players of a game simultaneously.
     * Developers can continue to add achievements after initial game release.
     * Get new achievements without being forced to purchase new content.
     * Lets developers monitor statistics of achievements and can respond with content to the interest of those players.
     * Most importantly

     * This allows different games and applications to allocate what's needed, Audio).
     * Microsoft doesn't want to make assumptions

##4. Xbox One Kinect
 * Kinect is required to physically be connected to Xbox One.
 * Matt Booty on why Kinect is required:
  *  ""From a design point of view, and I think that's just because of location.""
  * Think of computers
 * By knowing all Xbox One's have Kinect
 * They're making the Kinect just as much of a standard as a camera in a phone,False,self,t5_2xbci,1371598466.0,,xbox-day-one,t3_1gh043

As an Xbox One OS dev, it's not like we don't read around the internet on what everyone is saying about the Xbox One, our policies, and our company. We do take the time to think about our policies, re-evaluate, and re-confirm that we're making logical and well thought out decisions. Honestly, a lot of us don't care about the bickering that's going on everywhere and all the time about which console is better. Personally, that we deserve

I'm doing this AMA because when I joined this subreddit, what I see are people who don't support the Xbox One spreading false information, albeit unintentionally. People talking like they're an expert on this stuff and but having not a single clue. This leads to the Xbox One fans frantically defending Microsoft and/or its policies, sometimes with more false information due to the mess of a job we did at revealing the console. Some of the reasons people voice against the Xbox One, I really don't understand. Maybe it's because I work so closely to the console, I know exactly how it works and why certain things are simply ridiculous. I don't know.

So ask me almost anything. If I don't reply

tl;dr **Microsoft revolutionized the way developers access cloud computing resources.  This is revolutionizing the world
Microsoft provides the [Common Language Runtime](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Language_Runtime) to facilitate easy programming for Windows.  It handles the complex and sticky stuff such as managing execution of the program, mostly, about resources on the local machine -- CPU, RAM, etc.  Until now, there was no equivalent for easily executing and divvying up operations to cloud resources.  Rolling your own code to do this is cost-prohibitive and not worth it for nearly any company to develop.  The only reason it is for MS is because it will be integrated into over [90% of the home computers in the world, not including enterprise and mobile systems] (http://www.zdnet.com/latest-os-share-data-shows-windows-still-dominating-in-pcs-7000013351/)Microsoft changed the game by introducing a new model, for their Azure cloud.    

tl;dr **The new system is called Orleans and it makes accessing cloud computing storage and processing power just as straight-forward as local resources.**
Microsoft's new cloud programming model is called Orleans and has been in development for a few years.  It organizes units of computation and storage as ""grains"" that can seemlessly migrate between datacenters.  It ensures consistency and replication.  It manages debugging, configuration and maintenance.  It's *simple*(incredibly important).  It uses .NET languages which are easy enough to teach an elementary school kid in a week, yet robust enough to have developed some of the world's most complex enterprise software.

For the last 40+ years we have incrementally improved graphics through better local hardware.  We have been adding cores, as you could imagine, had Microsoft spent any time at E3 explaining the above things the damage would have been even worse.  Orleans, free Azure resources and deep integration into the Xbox one will assuredly create new experiences.  I am positive, after we experience and witness the benefits of the cloud, we will spend less time worrying about a few cores.  This cloud will become stronger and more efficiently used.  Microsoft dumps over $9 billion worth of money just to *research* cloud capabilities.  If you read their whitepapers, they put a heavy emphasis on cloud technologies that are going to benefit the Xbox one.  It's truly an exciting time we live in, just on the cloud, etc.  That's OK - just don't fall into the trap of ""Microsoft doesn't care about us"" and that any money you give them hurts gamers.  Microsoft spends 17% of their profits on research and development

It's worth noting

Don't see why this hasn't happened here

My questions:

* I saw a [Kinect tech demo with Wired where Scott Evans whips out a zebra custom colored Xbox One controller](http://youtu.be/Hi5kMNfgDS4?t=4m22s). Any chance we'll see custom controllers (aside from the Day One Edition) from Microsoft at launch? If not

* When browsing the Xbox Live Marketplace

* Another Marketplace question; Can we expect to see some system that allows you to build a cart and a wishlist? I would love to buy my sibling and friends games and I saw your response to someone stating that there most likely will be a gifting system. I would love to surprise them by knocking a game or two off a wishlist.

* Can we have more in depth knowledge on how the audio of the One? How customizable will audio settings be? If I'm playing Call of Duty multiplayer

* Which Xbox One exclusive are you most excited for?

* **Bonus Question:** Would you be my 101st friend when the Xbox One comes out? *Edit:* Actually better yet

If he does the AMA that'd be great

This is a list of things announced related to Kinect that I think are notable. Be it something for UI navigation or actual in game usage.

**Console**

-	UI navigation with hand gestures. You can flip, and push.

-	UI navigation with voice commands. “xbox on,” “watch TV,” “play game” are some of the commands you can use. There are tons more.

-	Identity recognition. After you sign in the first time, your settings, your list of games, etc.

-	Controller recognition. This works in junction with identity. Each controller is bound to the player holding it. There was a question asked about removal of the LED rings and not being able to tell who is player X. It doesn’t matter which controller you are using. The console handles it and recognizes where you and your friends are in the room and adjusts accordingly. We can even tell when one person is holding more than one controller.

**Gaming**

Some of the games announced for launch have been pretty revealing on what features they are using. Some people are still saying they haven’t seen any Kinect features in games. Well they’re right

Most of these are focusing on subtle controls in addition to using the controller.

**Ryse** – Voice commands to control legions of soldiers.

**Dead Rising 3** – There’s a lot of info on how DR3 is running with this. Zombies can hear you

**Killer Instinct** – You and your buddy sit in front of the Xbox

There was a demo shown at E3 called *Reflex*. This is an FPS game made in house to showcase how Kinect can be used. 

-	You’re shooting targets as usual

- Wait! Invisible enemies are shooting at you! Good thing your helmet has an XRAY vision module. You touch your right temple to activate it. Now you can see them and you waste them.

-	Giant obstacles are flying at you while you sprint across a stretch of land. Lean left or right with your body and you strafe/dodge/roll accordingly. You are too quick.

-	You’re shooting at flying enemies and these guys are tough. Your puny gun can’t penetrate their armor. Except you have rockets. Raise your finger and point at each of the targets to lock on and you say

Most of the game devs ping us when they need help with specific Kinect problems

The point I want to make is every policy change we made since E3 aren't complete reversals/180s/make like the PS4. But rather tailor our policies to allow more choices and options while keeping most of our original vision intact. Our executives made it pretty clear that their ears were going to be wide open to listen to public feedback and so far I

Here are my thoughts:

**DRM Policy**  
**Change**: Xbox one no longer requires 24hr check in.  

**Effect**: Removal of 10 people family sharing plan. People can now play offline

**Vision**: We are still pushing for a digital distribution model, on their own gamertags. One purchase, everyone in the family can play, on their own gamertags. You go to your friends house, all you need to do is sign in, and you and all your buddies can enjoy all your games.

**Included chat headset**  
**Change**: We are now including a headset in every box.

**Effect**: Everyone who doesn't want to use the Kinect to chat

**Vision**: We are still very confident in the Kinect's audio abilities. Including a chat headset allows the chat audio to be separated from game audio instead of everything all mixed together coming out of your TV.

**Kinect requirement**  
**Change**: The Kinect is no longer required to be plugged in at all times.

**Effect**: The Kinect is no longer required to be plugged in at all times.

**Vision**: This changes nothing about our original vision, this wasn't good enough for some people, so now you don't have to have it plugged in. If your Kinect ever breaks, your console will still work while you get a replacement. This is a good change.",,False,self,1376365793.0,t3_1k8qtl

Firstly, verbal abuse, harrassment, stalking - I can't believe people are worked up to such ridiculous levels about whether or not you support a GAMING machine or not. Is this a sign of the times? Is this what the internet has done? Given a voice to the hordes of uneducated morons that make themselves feel better by thinking they are a part of something (in this case, the cool online majority that hates xbox one?)

Secondly, thousands of xbox haters. And not normal xbox fans saying hey ms, we love you but we're struggling with this - no. The extreme haters that have signed up solely to ensure the degrees of abuse and rage against xbox and xbox fans continue. Xbox facebook group - why the frack are you in a group that 'likes' the xbox one if you don't? Is it that important to you that you actively seek out people who do wanna spend some time talking about something THEY like, to the point that you sign up just to try and make them feel bad?

Thirdly, people are OK with it. People are so uneducated about the things they are saying. Yeah I'm talking about that 16 year old idiot from some country across the world copying and pasting the middle finger up ascii to microsoft - even though he probably can't understand any of the text in the posts - just because it makes him look tough and everyone else is doing it. I understand there's things people don't like, and if you're against xbox and have strong feelings about why certain features upset you, fair enough. It's never going to please everyone. But people spewing the hatred they are with NO basis for the things they are saying is getting ridiculous.

1373239044.0,1htu6x,[Announcement] Countdown to Launch: All About the Games,whatdoyouwantmetosay,134,25,44,"**Updated with this week's schedule**

Hello fellow gamers

In an effort to bring a positive contribution to this sub, the different games that have been announced for the Xbox One.

There are approximately 50 games announced as of right now, a new game will be posted in an effort to give each game its time in the limelight.

[note: as of right now

-------------------

**Why?**

Right now we are in a stretch of time where news comes sparingly, /r/CFB, has filled this time by hosting a series of posts called 132+ teams in 132+ days, where each college football team is featured one day at a time, and I believe the format can carry over. See an example [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/CFB/comments/1ht4n3/132_teams_in_132_days_louisiana_ragin_cajuns/).

By offering up a designated day for each game

-------------------------

**Formatting**

Structure can be good, or if new information comes out for a game that we've already discussed.

Overall

&gt; **The first discussion will be for Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag

1372174274.0,1h1j2a,Opinion: Microsoft sees current competitors as a short-term battle. The real war will be Apple vs Valve vs Xbox One (wall of text ahoy!),clisby,200,94,224,"**tl;dr The ""console war"" will be waged between Apple

- **Apple** is a direct competitor to Microsoft in many markets (OS, Hulu and YouTube.  [In the first 8 months it sold 6 million units](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_TV#Sales) on-par with sales for previous generation systems.  It should be noted that while the box was exceptionally limited, it was still only $100.  If you can get past Objective-C(blech), suffice it to say Apple will make real-time console/mobile integration simple and a major feature.  They would have to jack up the specs of the AppleTV and, with the Apple tax+new controller, I have zero issue saying it would be $500+.  It would be using their iTunes marketplace with digital distribution.      

Points: Integration with Apple mobile and desktop devices

- The **SteamBox** is to use ""Big Picture Mode.""  The rumor describes it running a default configuration, it would have access to the Windows App Marketplace allowing it to run any number of multimedia apps and custom interfaces.  Users would also have access to their entire library of already-purchased Windows games (I could play my 140+ game library for free).  They would have access to the regular Steam sales that Steam would be able to offer due to their digital distribution -- why can steam do this?  Steam is the PC gaming giant with over 50-70% of game sales where game producers get gross margins of 70%, as opposed to the 30% producers get at retail.  They have no agreement with GameStop other than Steam gift cards. Steam is already introducing an (old)X1-cloned Sharing system.  Manufacturer Xi3's Piston Design has been demoed and pitched as a candidate, with the shown Piston model being $1,000.  Models are rumored to be between $500-1000.  I think it will take Steambox a while to get adoption beyond dedicated gamers for a while.  It has the capabilities, but its multimedia will be seen more like an HTPC which is not exactly mainstream yet.  Give it a few more years before it can compete for ""Input one""

Points: Integration with Windows, strong multimedia capabilities, digital distribution, unique eye/biometric control, manufacturers can include HDMI-in and HTPC features, massive indie presence, can use Playstation and Xbox controls if desired


- The **Playstation** has been a contemporary competitor to the Microsoft Xbox, a monstrous zealous fanbase, cross-platform purchases where people already own hundreds of AAA games, an extensive app marketplace and jaw-dropping summer sales with a traditional console?  Microsoft is fighting the battle for Input 1, as they have said for a while. This battle will be against Steambox and AppleTV. The PS4 will get Input 2 or 3 after the TV.  It can't fight Apple's multimedia, and it can't fight Steambox's games.    

Points: $400

I think microsoft wasn't concerned about Sony in the long run.  Nearly every move Microsoft has made more matches up to hit Steambox/AppleTV head-on.  Microsoft just needs an early market footprint.  Microsoft did well in the 360 vs PS3 war due to an earlier release.  They want to repeat this early advantage in regards to the AppleTV and Steambox.  The PS4 is a short term battle, but the war will be against AppleTV and Steambox.  The new kids are going to be monsters on release and are used games and a couple hundred dollars enough to beat them?  I genuinely doubt it.  You need the games, apps, TV integration, PC integration, expanded input and points of differentiation such as the cloud.    

Microsoft has a new architecture, Netflix and other features.  Microsoft, for being able to compete as a multimedia giant, has an *exceptional* price point.  Like PS4 it has strong studios and IPs. Microsoft saw this future and has been preparing for it for years.  They will be ready.  **Only good things will happen for gamers in a battle between these three giants**

This is a title that could easily become an  Xbox One Kinect exclusive.  It's a failed kickstarter project made by former Lionhead developers.  Kinect One is a lot better and this really takes us back to the Project Natal promise.  You remember Ian don't you Microsoft?  Of course you do.

The Xbox One still has some really great stuff.


For example we still have...

* The possibilities of cloud computing - The change in policy hasn't changed this is any way. Games can and hopefully will still take advantage of this feature.

* Dedicated Servers for every game.

* The new OS - This includes stuff like instant switch, skype, TV, Twitch streaming integration, SmartGlass, new ""Smart Match"" matchmaking, new achievements etc.

* Brand new controller - It has rumble in the triggers. That's so cool.

* Day one digital downloads.

* Kinect - Arguably the most ""next gen"" feature of the console. The Kinect will still be bundled and this will hopefully lead to more developers taking advantage of the Kinect more often and in more interesting ways.

3.  Love technology advancements but downplay that XB1 is pushing limitations like cloud computing (not PS cloud storage only), Kinect2, and other new features.  PS4 has some, but nothing near XB1.

4.  Are worried about privacy with the Kinect (which can be turned off) but PS lost info on 77M accounts when [they were hacked](http://www.forbes.com/sites/karstenstrauss/2012/10/25/sony-ps3-hacked-again-all-future-games-decryptable-no-solution-possible/).  Numerous times.

* Sniper rifle scope stability tied to pulse and/or movement. Breathe slow and keep still. Suddenly sniping becomes extra tense.  Stealth can also be tied to these.

* An app that shows my heartrate in a separate window while playing games. I can get pretty stressed during multiplayer games

* Heart rate variability (HRV) training. Holy shit, Kinect 2 is sensitive enough to track HRV ([article here](http://mobihealthnews.com/22628/xbox-one-kinect-2-0-and-the-future-of-health-technology/)). You probably don't know what that is, but it's a very cool tool to use for health and meditation. I actually have [one of these](http://www.heartmath.com/), but you don't need one if you want to explore HRV -- there are free iPhone (and probably Android) apps that will track your HRV with your phone's camera. 

* Multiplayer games that show you the expression of the person you just killed/killed you. Optional cartoon masks/hats/accessories over faces for privacy 

* Temporarily mute your mic with a gesture. Hold up your finger for a sec so people can't hear you fart

I know GameStop is not accepting preorders but this is for the future if they ever claim they have left.

So I preordered the PS4 first back in early June and gladly reserved my spot. I have a GameStop Powerup card so preordering is quick and simple. As I was preordering
She told me that there's like 3 consoles left (which is fair) but she kept reminding me about the DRM and 24hour connectivity. I told her that it doesn't affect me but she ignored it and said it could hurt me in the long run (which I'm very sure it won't)

Now

About 3 weeks ago
They again reminded me that Xbox might put the DRM back but I told her I just want to preorder. They said that they will give me a heads up notice when it happened. 

Keep in mind I was smooth and had no attitude towards them

This is just a heads up to anyone wanting to preorder. Just because your local GameStop filled with bullshit liars says no

But with age comes abit of perspective . The race for the ""must have console"" is only in its opening stage and Sony has made some major sacrifices to get the early lead . Like 

1. throwing away the Playstation Eye.
 In a report from IGN http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/06/26/sony-sacrificed-the-playstation-4-camera-to-beat-microsoft-on-price Sony threw away years of investment and possible future innovation to save a few bucks. 

2. Doubling down on core gamers to make a profit . 

All companies need a significant profit to stay in business . Thats why they exist and without it they won't.  In a compelling article from wired.com  http://www.wired.com/gamelife/2013/05/xbox-one-gaming/ they lay out the real problem that console gaming isn't profitable in the fractured gaming world we live in. So clearly they're trying to take MS players to change that . But what % of gamers would they need to turn the tide? 


3. No blockbuster exclusive titles. 

Playststion has good exclusive games and are in love with inde titles , console selling games. The have nothing that can compete sales wise with , Halo or  Gears of War . Add to that Titanfall which has received universal praise http://news.xbox.com/2013/06/e3-xbox-one-and-xbox-360-games-win-big-at-e3 &amp; Plants vs Zombies : Garden Warfare and the gap looks to be widening. 

MS &amp; Xbox are taking the exact opposite longterm approach .  

1. Kinetc included 

2. Diversifying their target audience and consoles' abilities beyond gaming.

3. Adding to there blockbuster lineup 
Microsoft has it's challenges 
 
Taking a step back it looks clear to me that Sony is trying to win now at the expence of the  future. This tactic may work but it is very dangerous at best 

As a company I'd love to be in the lead like Sony 

EDIT :Thanks for all the comments.

 Many have said in the comments that the PS eye isn't dead . I did provide a link to a legit news piece saying the Eye is dead. They/I could be wrong 

I did say Sony has great games . 

No one has argued against my assurtion that doubling down on core gamers will not raise enough money to be profitable longterm. If you can

I will be completely honest with you, playing games like Trials HD, and Halo 3/Reach. I enjoyed a lot of things about the 360, and have no problem understanding why people love the Xbox ecosystem. 

But this isn't about me.

Microsoft had a great conference today. I skipped out on the last half of a class to watch it, yes, the last half hour of Sony's conference did truly sway my decision). I look forward to hearing more about Quantum Break, as well as seeing that new Swery game (D4). The XBone looks like it will be a great platform in a lot of ways, and I hope that those of you who decide to make it your platform of choice enjoy it immensely =)

Then I took a 12 hour breather and came back to it with a level head. What they're doing may be to their benefit money-wise

Now before you go saying

Unfortunately

Currently, Xbox One will launch with 300,000 Azure Servers. This means(as they have already stated for one game) dedicated servers! Cloud computing will also allow for a much more powerful system than people realize.

Think of it like this. With just about every game, AI movements, etc. this can be done by the Cloud instead, leaving more processing power for things on the client side(your side). 

I believe that I read today that it will actually boost processing power x10. I personally need to get some more concrete data on the subject

What an exciting feature! This essentially will also expand the life-time of the console itself as it gets older and the hardware becomes more obsolete.

People make the point that MS is moving into the future

P.S. I'm not making a knock at PS fans. They have a great system coming their way. I'll be picking one up probably next summer for their exclusives. But I'm more I'm more intrigued at this point by MS and their new found hardware.

I only buy new games so the used game stuff doesn't bother me. I have essentially very few friends in the town I live in that are gamers to borrow games from that fees or blocking borrowed games still doesn't matter to me. 

Ah

I am sorry for everyone else but Microsoft built this box specifically for me. However I do understand that other people have very necessary concerns about this stuff and am not trying to make light of the plight of my fellow gamers and their situations. If my conditions were different then I would be voicing my anger as well but at this stage in my life I really just dont give a damn. I play games to take off some steam and keep connected with my friends back home. The Xbox One will do all of that and more.

So these boxes are going to be multimedia boxes, it's a little quieter, cooler, faster, smaller, etc., but nothing substantial from a hardware perspective. Software is updated and made better.

The key here is the Kinect. Yes, but who cares how fast the horse is if the reigns take several seconds to snap?

The Kinect is Microsoft's answer to the [Apple Rings](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/apple/9970126/Apple-to-launch-TV-with-ring-remote-control-says-analyst.html). We laugh

Besides losing a remote, I have to know what channel it's on and what time. If I look for it digitally, I have to sift through menus or use the archaic text-search. Text search is great on keyboard driven devices like PC's or phones. They're horrendous to use on remote controls or controllers.

So, and only 24 million Kinects. You can't develop a strong UI when you know nearly 2/3rds of your consumers can't use it. Lack of homogeneity kills product innovation. When you have no standard, you give a ton of less incentive for people to develop for something, and your teams working on the UI (user-interface) and UX (user-experience) are too busy creating several different experiences that all come up short in the end.

Now, again, stifles product innovation. When you have the potential of Kinect's voice commands, which remove potentially dozens of hurdles between the UI and the user, you are left with a really slick UI and UX. Now, this is why we've seen so much about this 3GB, 3 in one, speed

So where does this all leave us? Well now it's time for the experience. This is the last mile, but they really need to let people know that there are major reasons why they should pick this up over an Apple TV. It's now or never.

So yeah

*Why it’s important:* This is the first console release of a game that doesn’t follow Desmond. It also follows on the heels of the polarizing third entry. Regardless

*Best Case Scenario:* A return of one of the more recognizable franchises as more than just a yearly installment. Edward is likable and interesting

*Worst Case Scenario:* Uninspired gameplay

I get home from work roughly half an hour before my girlfriend (most days - some days I work from home and I can game whenever I want). The 360 is in our living room because we use it for EVERYTHING. My girlfriend is not a gamer, so I ususally don't mind losing the game time. We usually end up chilling on the couch watching Netflix after that. This gives me about 25 minutes of potential, precious game time every evening before the living room gets taken over. I turn the xbox on, put the game in...great... there's an update. Okay, it's just another 5 minutes. I still have 20 minutes of game time. 

Finally get the game on. I'm playing Fable III. The thing about Fable III is that it auto-saves after each mission

Later on, but I think the listing system sucks. We can never 'just find a movie' that we want to watch with trawling through endless lists of titles. The search menu is crap too. Try typing in Christian Bale with your xbox remote, only to find that you've seen all of the movies they have. It's really annoying and before you know it, you've wasted an hour of movie time.

Now, and I don't think many people have considered how much of an impact instantaneous gaming / tv / movies will be. I would get home, say 'Xbox On', game boots up right away from wherever I last paused it, and I get a full 30 minutes of play. Any updates are already loaded and ready to go, so no game time lost there. Then I say 'Xbox TV' and my girlfriend gets her TV show. Then we say something along the lines of 'Search Christian Bale' (or something), and we get all his movies instantly

I've just cut out so much dead time it's unbelievable. Taking into consideration what this means, it can feel like forever. 

This is going to be a solution to one of those problems that we never even knew we had, skype for communication etc) it's going to making our gaming lives a hell of a lot more convenient. ",,False,self,t5_2xbci,False,,

That last part is key. The thing i loved about the Xbox 360 was the innovation of features i never knew i needed. First my standard for multiplayer was LAN parties at most. Then they added Xbox Live which made the whole process 100% more convenient. Then they added parties and cross-game chat

I feel like what microsoft is doing is just what they've done before: innovate. One of the biggest things for me is the cloud storage of all games. This is something that i could not be more excited for. Furthermore, there of course has to be restrictions so as to keep you from buying a game and single handedly giving it to all of your friends for free.

For instance, go to gamestop and sell the game, and now, viola, a near free game. This method could be done for giving your games to friends in an endless sharing loop. It's just business sense that these restrictions be imposed.

___


**Kinect:**

-Facial recognition to sign into profile, as it can recognize who is where and is using which controller.

-Voice commands (Xbox, order large Hawaiian pizza)

-1080p camera

-Uses advanced noise cancellation

-Can recognize your mood

-Because every controller has an IR LED

-Can now track rotation (orientation of body parts), infrared (enables it to see you in the dark), etc.

-Can track up to 6 people

-Can be used from around 3-4ft away

-[Check out this awesome video by Wired.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hi5kMNfgDS4)

-***Can be turned off.***

___

**Other:**

-Instant switching between games

-Cloud processing can take some of the pressure off of the GPU. Latency may still be an issue.

-300,000. Also, Microsoft is giving devs access to these servers for no cost. Dedicated servers are not mandatory, but since there's no reason not to use them... [Peter Rubin expects all your games such as CoD, Titanfall, Destiny, and Battlefield to use dedicated servers.](http://videogamesandnews.com/xbox-one-multiplayer-features-dedicated-servers-smart-match-trd/)

-Every console is a dev kit.

-Virtually [unlimited](http://www.neowin.net/news/xbox-one-to-have-unlimited-cloud-storage) storage in the cloud for digital games, etc.

-No HDCP protection in the Blu-Ray drive. This means you can plug in a capture card device to record gameplay. Unclear about how it will play Blu-Ray movies without HDCP

-New reputation system that lets you avoid people you don't want to play with. Article [here](http://news.xbox.com/2013/07/games-reputation-feature).

-HDMI in port- you can plug in almost anything that has an HDMI port. Xbox 360. PlayStation, and then control that through the One (voice commands also work for this).

-Snap mode! Snap any app to the side no matter what you're doing. Want to Skype a friend to watch some Netflix together? Say ""Xbox

-All party chat uses Skype for better sounding audio.

-Matchmaking is done in the background. You can do other things while waiting for the Xbox to match you with players in Halo.

-Low power state in the controller. When you're watching a Netflix movie for example

-Has a unique TV guide for when you plug your cable box in the HDMI in. You can take full control of it using your voice. Want to know what's on Comedy Central? ""Xbox

-Fantasy sports integration. Keep track of how your dream team is doing and get notifications as they're playing.

-Uses Twitch TV to stream gameplay.

-Use the Smartglass app from your Android

-Uses Wi-Fi direct to connect to Smartglass-enabled devices. Wi-Fi Direct can reach bandwidth speeds of up to 250Mbps, wireless headset, etc. will be able to send around 20 times more data than Bluetooth 4.0. A great Wi-Fi Direct vs Bluetooth 4.0 article by PCWorld [here.

The mom looks are her son and asks him if he still wants the system.  The kid is clearly thrown off and starting to second guess himself.  The mom tell the kid ""*It is your money so you can do whatever you want with it.*""  When I realized that this little kid probably worked his ass off

While the article is neat

This leads to the trolls part. Many trolls have been coming into this sub-reddit just to attack the Xbox One in any way shape or form or try and start arguments that this Sub-reddit is a circlejerk. Well look at what sub-reddit you are in. You are in the Xbox One sub-reddit and you **WILL** have pro comments for the product. Many are bait and fish and those usually get down voted but recently iv been seeing many many troll comments being up voted with mis-information. This leads to people who don't know about exactly what the Xbox can and cannot offer to be misinformed

I see many of these trolls talk down about the ""Cloud"". Many of them say it's a marketing gimmick and sure maybe the word is

There has to be something done with this. **My only solution would be for mods to delete straight troll posts and hide karma for up to 24 hours for each post.

Please also give idea's and whatever feedback you can. If you agree or disagree with whatever i am trying to say.

**Edit #1:** I am not saying that there isn't the extreme side of us either. There are some people who take things a bit too far as well. We know the cloud tech Microsoft is bringing is good and very new. Now this doesn't mean that it will be a giant improvement over graphics but we will see some very cool stuff with it. I know there are some bad apples who do like the Xbox One and do defend it a tad bit more then usual but you have to understand everywhere an Xbox One enthusiasts goes on the internet they get ridiculed and bashed. Most of the time it is just misinformation like the xbox one blowing up when you don't connect it every 24 hours (lol)

I would like to point out after E3 I received death threats and many comments stating i was a Microsoft employee just because i liked the thing. I still like it and look forward to it each and every day. I check this sub-reddit for more information about it but every time i look at the comments to see what people have to say it is always filled with people fighting, tell them in an informed matter.

That is where Kinect comes in, the game can remember what moments make you the most tense/scared and is more likely to bring hose up into the future. No more sanity meters needed, your own sanity is what will drive the show.

Think of it like this, dark hallway, that contains many, many rooms. Each one of those room could hide the monster you know is following you. Your heart rate races as you slowly walk down the dimly lit hallway. Seeing this through Kinect, the game triggers an in-game hallucination that shows the hallway's darkness coming like a black torrent of water to pull you away. You scream, close your eyes and shirk back. Kinect will then, having seen your eyes break contact with the screen return the scene to the normal dark hallway. You shake it off and press on, a hungry snarl reaching your ears from behind you...

Hey everyone! I had originally posted this in /r/xbox360 but realized it was more appropriate here! This is my first time posting to this sub

Redeemable codes can be found in almost every new 360 game. Be it for a special level, they are everywhere. I often forget to redeem them simply because Im so excited to play the game and I skip the slow process of typing them in. I think it would be very neat and useful if Kinect could redeem them for me. All you would have to do is say to Kinect ""Xbox, redeem code"" and hold the piece of paper with the code up to the camera. It would probably have to be closer to the device itself but it saves so much time typing the number in. iTunes already does this with their cards and its remarkable easy. Features like this one that are simple but rewarding should be focused on with the new kinect. So? What do you all think?

as a proud owner of both a Playstation 3 and an Xbox 360, I simply walk three steps to my charger and replace the battery I'm using with the one I have on the charger. I cycle them like that. It takes maybe fifteen seconds and I'm right back to gaming.

When I play my ps3 for a long time and my battery starts to run low, there isn't a standalone battery. I instead tether five or six usb cables together from my ps3 USB port to the end of my controller so I can continue to play while it charges. It's also worth noting that this function only works when the Ps3 is turned on

Five years down the line

A year after that

One of the features that fans of Samsungs Galaxy phone lineup laudes over the iPhone is that the battery can be replaced by the owner whereas the iPhone battery can only be replaced by paying apple to do it for you. But for some reason, I'm paying a little extra money upfront to get my batteries and charger for xbox but six years later it cost me less than replacing my ps3 controller.

Also

Surely I'm not the only person out there who sees the logic and benefits of replaceable batteries.

*UPDATE*

1374718300.0,1j00qx,[Technical Long Read] How Hyper V coupled with XB1 Game and Windows OS actually works,Craer,67,12,53,"I've been reading a lot of posts on here about the Game OS and Windows OS on the XB1 with regards to RAM and CPU allocation.  This especially came to be true today with CBOAT post about Indie games being locked to the Windows OS and would only be allowed 3GB of ram.  His

Let’s start with what Microsoft has actually said about XB1:   [Source!] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLBVHZokt1Q) There is a ton of good info on this panel about the architecture of the XB1
  
- 8GB Ram DDR3  
- 3 OS's (XBox Operating System
- Hyper-V requirement:  512mb + 32MB for each Virtual Machine.  
- Windows OS VM:  3GB ram allocated  
- XB OS VM:  5GB ram allocated  
  
###HyperV:  
This is a completely stripped down version of what we see today, because they know exactly what 2 Virtual Machines will be running on the system.  They don't have to worry about  different OS's or any type of flexibility for the end user, every XB1 is the same.  They know exactly how the 2 Virtual Machines on the XB1 will be configured and used.  
  
###XB1 OS:  
This is the gaming OS.  1 game at a time can run here.  Games get installed to the hard drive and then run from there on this OS.  This has a set reservation of resources that is always available if it is needed.  
  
###Windows 8 OS:  
This OS boots right when the box is turned on, GameDVR will run and will be always available.  Based off of the Build conference, this is also where end user published apps will run as well and possibly Indie games based off of the rumors going around today.  
  
So what does this all mean?  Why does HyperV really matter?  Well HyperV and virtualization will play a huge role in where resources are assigned.  There are many ways that HyperV can assign resources to each VM and guarantee that it will have resources available to it when it is needed.  Two of these being Dynamic Memory and Nested Page Tables (both available in Windows Server 2012 HypeV).  
  
###Dynamic Memory:  
  
Here are 3 videos explaining memory optimization in virtual machines as well as how Dynamic Memory and Nested Page Tables work.  [Video 1] (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-xX7WCnJlU) [Video 2] (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HfZrqYD0XMg) [Video 3] (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CGL_-XwoxVk)  
  
This allows HyperV to allocate and de-allocate memory from a guest VM based on usage while the Virtual Machine is running.  So what does this mean for the XB1?  Well
  
So
  
Is this exactly how Microsoft has designed the XB1?  Probably, so I can’t say for sure.  All I know is there is a lot of benefits for them to choose to have their environment based on Hyper-V and 2 separate OS’s that gives them a lot of flexibility that just can’t happen if they did not choose a virtual platform.  I could write and talk about virtualization a lot more, but my guess is you guys are already pretty bored.  Hope ya guys learned something and got something out of this.

**Developer:** Ubisoft Montreal

**Publisher:** Ubisoft

**Director:** Jonathan Morin

**Writer:** Kevin Shortt

**NA Release Date:** November 19 (Xbox 360, [November 19, unless Release Day is a later date] (Xbox One, PS4)

**Kinect:** No

**Smartglass:** Yes

**Exclusive:** No

**Genre:** 3rd person action

&gt; **EDITORIAL**

*Why it’s important:* It’s a present-day stealth game that isn’t Splinter Cell. A lot of marketing by Ubisoft says they expect this to do just as well as Assassin’s Creed

*Best Case Scenario:* Watch Dogs takes the Assassin’s Creed open-world formula and infuses enough tech to transform it into an all-new kind of game. The storyline makes more sense than the typical Assassin’s Creed fare.

*Worst Case Scenario:* Some really cool ideas that don’t seem to be fully developed keep the game from reaching the higher echelons of gaming lore.

The upside is that we can play offline and sell our games.

But in my case, which most of them are MMO or heavily focused on Multiplayer Games, I want to have a choice to Opt-In the 24h check in for discless gaming, Family Sharing and my Game Library everywhere I go.

I was incredibly excited for next gen gaming, and any other online resources I could get my paws on. I am a huge 360 fan, and I think xbox live blows ps+ out of the water (I have both). Yet I came away from all the online information feeling let down by Microsoft.

In my mind, family features, and other non-gaming gimmicks, while providing inferior hardware.

I immediately went out and preordered a ps4, ""forced"" use of kinect, reportedly inferior power under the hood, etc.

Then, I was sad that ingenuity was stifled and market diversity was lessened.

Perhaps I merely made a decision too fast

So I had a change of heart

To make me feel even dumber, but now I know I can't.

Also, but I'm sure there are other ways the DRM policy reversal has weakened the potential of the xbone that I don't even know about.

So I suppose that what I'm saying is:

1) Sorry Microsoft for doubting your intentions after you've made so many of my gaming experiences phenomenal over the past eight years with 360

2) Sorry gaming community

*Why it’s important:* After Skyrim’s massive success

*Best Case Scenario:* TESO somehow sidesteps the pitfalls of almost every big-budget MMO to follow World of Warcraft. The game can be played like a cooperative Skyrim/Oblivion/Morrowind.

*Worst Case Scenario:* Yet another big-budget MMO that is a solid design but fails to bring any new gamers into the genre. TESO is seen as a sub-par experience that tries to do too many things at once.

MS has been sanguine about this issue, because they are relating it to their experience with the current Kinect and thinking that it will be more-or-less like that.  It will not.  It is normal that people doubt that a distant device sitting next to a huge source of noise can perform as well as a close-speak mic, but (amazingly) it will - and certainly better than a 360 headset.

[Here is a demo showing the result of signal processing on the Kinect 2](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dSefGxnThc&amp;t=2m19s), with all noise and reverberation subtracted.  This is where people generally say ""That *has* to be fake,"" ""Noise cancellation just doesn't work that way, it's impossible,"" or ""It's not going to work that well in the real world.""

The thing is, teleconferencing, and other deadly-dull business applications,) and they've fecking perfected it.  Without this technology, using distant speech voice recognition for UI navigation wouldn't be practical at all..  I don't think most gamers have a clear idea of just how much more advanced the signal processessing is on the Kinect 2 than it is on the current Kinect.  (There is an order of magnitude of difference, here.)   I will do my best to articulate that a bit:

The current Kinect already does some cool stuff to clean up an audio signal - and it is obviously much better than you'd get if you just stuck a sensitive mic up a few meters away and talked at it, you can usually still hear noise in the background if the environment is noisy - it's muffled, but there -  This sort of signal processessing can only do so much.  This is why the current kinect (while still very cool) sometimes misses the mark with its voice recogntion, requiring you to repeat yourself or picking up false positives from TV dialog.

The new Kinect still uses beamforming like the old Kinect, the signal is further dereverberated using spatio-temporal averaging to clean it up as much as possible for voice isolation.

Voice isolation is where things get intense. The cleaned signal is fed through glottal-synchronous speech processing algorithms.  This breaks up the waveform of the incoming speech signal by identifying the glottal openings and closures and working on these segments as individual problems.   If your sample is taken in an noisy environment, and apply additional algorithms as appropriate for each of these cases, to model the waveform of the signal (speech) without any trace of the noise.  Output from these algorithms at various stages is fed through a rake receiver  to self-correct and improve the signal-to-noise ratio. The speech is *resynthesized* and streamed out in realtime.  This means voice and voice only gets passed on for speech synthesis or voice communication - it's done instantaneously and at the hardware level, so there's a nice clean voice signal for Skype or games or whatever.  If you're not math-phobic, you may enjoy a fascinating 90-minute presentation from 2011, detailing the nuts-and-bolts of some of these concepts here: [Microphone array signal processing: beyond the beamformer](http://research.microsoft.com/apps/video/default.aspx?id=152104).

This signal is actually likely to be better than we're used to with a 360 headset mic - not just because 360 headset mics are prone to picking up ambient noise and room reverberation (which will be absent with the Kinect 2's chat) but also because they have a very poor bitrate

This is one of those ""Holy shit!"" things about the new Kinect hardware that has had me geeking out hard for the Xbox One ever since details started trickling out.  On the one hand, it *is* a bit of a wordy word - it's hard to explain to people *why* it will work as well as expected, in easily-digestible little soundbites.  This is one of those things where seeing is believing, but if you can't wait to see it, you can also be persuaded with a couple of hours of reading.",,False,t5_2xbci,True

I'm going to start with something near and dear to me in the Dreamcast days of having the VMU.    One of my favorite uses of the VMU in NFL 2K was being able to call my plays without my opponent seeing them.

*Why it’s important:* This is going to be a good metric of the XB1 community

*Best Case Scenario:* A constantly updating database means you can always try out someone’s new creation

*Worst Case Scenario:* The best worlds get voted up quickly and no content turnover means that there isn’t much incentive to create. Important content goes behind a paywall

Good news

” Today, or consumers for enabling transfer of these games. ”

Obviously with Xbox’s load and license requirement there may be an extra step but this is essentially the status quo and the same position as Sony.

Sharing

You can still give games to your friends

Being able to share with 10 friends is a HUGE development that MS needs to brag about more. It makes Sony’s game swap video look ridiculous and antiquated. With Xbox One there’s no need to swap discs or wait to get them back. And if I have 15 games my friends can try as many as they want without borrowing my whole library. For someone like me that lives far away from most of my friends this is awesome.

Game Business Model

But MS best new idea and most consumer friendly is that they are trying to change the whole video game business model. Consider Killer Instinct, and purchase more if you choose. I’ve also read that they will be offering a subscription-type season pass model. Three different ways to play one game. If you’re a Jago fan you get an entire video game for free. If you absolutely have to play Orchid that’s your choice too. You get to decide exactly what the game is worth to you. Project Spark is also rumored to be free-to-play. 

Obviously not all Xbox One game will offer these type of options but just the fact that MS is trying something new should be considered fantastic news. If people want the amazing deals that Steam offers they’re more likely to eventually get them on Xbox One. If a 24 hour check-in is required to stamp out piracy so be it.

This is about as consumer friendly as it gets. MS is essentially getting out of the way and letting publishers create their own business model. Consumers will get to vote with their wallets.

Seems like in standby

14W may not sound like much but energy prices here in Germany average about ~€0.28/kWh (Source: Wikipedia)

I don't know about US prices

The interview:

&gt; **Q: Are there any details Microsoft is willing to provide regarding the power consumption? What about the low-powered state?**

&gt; A: When it’s ready to respond to “Xbox On” it uses about 14 watts, which is less than about a half a U.S. cent or one-third of a Euro cent per day. 

Note: I think the ""4 Euro cents"" figure is actually using US prices

There are also a few other interesting tidbits in there:

&gt; **Q: Are there still any of the other parts of the hardware, CPU clock speed etc., potentially subject to change or are the specs more or less set in stone with the tweak of the GPU?**

&gt; A: The changes Marc detailed regarding the clock speed of the GPU were software changes to the OS.  Building a console like Xbox One entails years of planning, etc and is for the most part locked at the time you start to put development kits into the hands of developers.  

&gt; **Q: Can Microsoft rule out changes to the price point that was announced at E3? ($/€ 499)**

&gt; A: We are very confident with the value we provide at $/€ 499 and the unparalleled

She stated that any gamertag that plays on this console will be a 'gold'. XB360 users will still have to pay for their individual accounts still.

Also

    
EDIT: /u/RegularJohn17 via /r/xboxone/ said it better than me

&gt;You pay for gold and you have a ""home"" console where your gamertag and all your games/dlc licences live. If any other gamer tag signs in on this (even if your not signed in) they can use your gold status even if they don't pay for gold.
&gt;
&gt;If you go sign in at a friends house who doesn't have gold you can use the advantages of your gold but then when your friend signs back into his gamertag he cant use gold anymore.
&gt;

1372021878.0,1gxfc2,The Third Pillar - How Apps Could Change Everything,rastex,49,11,39,"One thing that hasn't gotten much attention is the concept of Apps and how they're going to play a role in the coming generation.

First

Currently there's no ""go to"" device that the mainstream public uses to connect to their TV and use apps that are designed and developed with the TV in mind. It's not a stretch to consider that Microsoft is going to be positioning the Xbox One as this device - but I make the bolder claim that they're in a better position than Sony to actually succeed at making it happen.

Gamers have obviously focused on price and tech specs (similar to Blackberry fans when the iPhone was first introduced)

* **5GB of Usable Ram out of 8GB** - from rumours it's been stated that developers can only use 5GB of RAM for their XB1 games, NFL, twitter/social and Internet Explorer. The key thing that they've demonstrated is that these apps are running **simultaneously** with the game. My guess is that the PS4's media apps will not be accessible simultaneously with game playing - there just isn't enough memory. What this means is that on the XB1 you'll be able to have bigger and better apps that are also accessible at any time - which means you'll actually use them.

* **Kinect** - it's pretty easy to see that a game controller is not the ideal way to control a random application - and I think it'll be very clear in the future that just like touch screens won out over physical keyboards

* **Ecosystem** - Microsoft makes Windows the most popular operating system in the world. And you can see that they've been designing their Desktop, but may also be true from a development perspective. If a developer can code up an app and with minimal amount of work have it running on 3 different platforms and be available to 10s of millions of users then that makes the platform substantially more lucrative. It's the reason why people don't code for Windows Phone right now, there's just not enough devices out there. Sony doesn't have other platforms they can leverage, so their only option is to do some kind of Android compatibility. Unfortunately for them, every device that's tried to have an Android compatibility ""option"" never works.

As long as XB1 is *good enough* for TV (which it is) and *good enough* for games (which it also is) then apps may become the standard by which we judge these next consoles.

Aside: This may also be why we're not hearing too much from MS on indie games. My guess is that the divide will be between ""console games"" which are the $60 affairs we're used to, no payment for updates, etc.",,False,self,t5_2xbci,,http://www.reddit.com/r/xboxone/comments/1gxfc2/the_third_pillar_how_apps_could_change_everything/

**Developer:** Insomniac Games (Spyro series, Fuse)

**Publisher:** Microsoft Studios

**Insomniac Games CEO:** Ted Price

**NA Release Date:** [TBA] (XB1)

**Kinect:** N/A

**Smartglass:** N/A

**Exclusive:** Yes

---

&gt; **EDITORIAL**

*Why it’s important:* It’s an open-world shooter with a bright color palette. Probably more important is how vehemently Ted Price is endorsing the use of XB1’s cloud. He insists that being connected online will allow his team to be constantly updating and bringing new things into the game.

*Best Case Scenario:* An online shooter that is as slick as it is fun. Quick turnaround on updates keep the online environment alive and burgeoning.

*Worst Case Scenario:* The game releases in an unpolished state with intent to finalize things once it’s in consumer hands. The game is the second coming of Brink.

Notes:

Insomniac Games’ most recent release Fuse was bad because it was uninteresting and indistinguishable from the entire realm of shooters that have inhabited the last generation. Sunset Overdrive does not appear to suffer the same issues.

Notice the extensive usage of billboards and advertising in the trailer.

*Discussion Prompts*

* Where do you think a shooter like this will fit alongside games like Titanfall and Halo? Can these games coexist?

* What do you think is the significance that Insomniac is now developing a game for the XB1 exclusively?

* What has you excited about Sunset Overdrive?

*Why it’s important:* Microsoft is pretty proud of this one. A lot of attention has been given to it at conferences and expos

*Best Case Scenario:* It takes off and finds its way into the fighting league circuits. People will always find a reason to hate

One thing I recall from classes at the College of Comp Sci at my uni, verbs) and trying to extrapolate weaker words by comparing the puzzle to a massive database of sentences to determine the highest probability of a match.  This allows computers to differentiate between ""for"" and ""four"", ""there"", ""their"", and ""they're"", and other homophones, simply by statistically guessing.

Having worked with Voice Recognition technology throughout my life, and then compare its results to a base case (the stored knowledge of what the paragraph actually says) and grade its performance.  In all cases, the machines would adapt to better process your voice, but only when given constructive feedback.  You had to tell the software that it was mistaken when it misunderstood a word.  This software also had very large databases of knowledge with which it did its comparisons, and those databases needed to be expandable as the machine ""learned"".

Flash forward back to the day of unboxing the Kinect 1.0.   I was absolutely positive, not only an accent diverse country like USA, but also multiple countries of various languages and accents.  Shocked was I when the Kinect booted right up and started accepting simple commands.  At first I wrote it off as a common hack where you use words easily differential to normal common place words.  Words like ""Xbox"" have few commonly spoken homophones.  But when we started using the search features ""Xbox, Bing, Star Trek Nemesis"", and the system was able to get it on the first try, I was greatly impressed.  Where was the GBs of stored inference data?  I presume that the data was stored offsite and that your inquiries were being transmitted to a server, and served the response not unlike how Siri works.

&gt; *EDITORIAL*

*Why it’s important:* This is Microsoft’s answer to the “why don’t you support indie games” question. Sword &amp; Sworcery is well-lauded in the indie game world and there’s no reason to think that with the same creative force they can’t pull off another hit.

*Best Case Scenario:* Capy makes Below a must-play game. It leads the way in Microsoft’s indie game development

*Worst Case Scenario:* The hardcore

The game features no dialogue or text whatsoever. All cues will happen on-screen. The perspective is so far back that your character looks only a handful of pixels tall, apparently, as Kris Piotrowski [hints in his interview with Xbox Wire](http://news.xbox.com/2013/06/e3-below-interview).

1372388666.0,1h83af,A Quick Thought on Improving Xbox One PR by Using Awkward Engineers,clisby,43,9,30,"**tl;dr engineers and architects are making Build conference enjoyable.  Replacing business people with technical people may benefit the Xbox One marketing**  - No really

I believe we can mostly agree there is room for improvement in Microsoft's presentation of Xbox One.  After having a blast watching the MS Build developer conference for something like 10 hours over the last two days (don't laugh)

At Build, are often socially awkward, and get flustered.  *But* they seem genuinely excited for their product, technology and to be a part of Microsoft.  Their excitement is sincere and not manufactured.  A few of them are flat out hilarious.  One guy was drawing horrible looking kittens and deathstars but I ate it up.  I related to them.  He was a brother in this crazy, exciting IT world.  Ballmer spoke briefly but seemed very out of place and further reinforced the divide between the business and development sides.         

At E3, an engineer is less likely to improvise and try to deflect questions.  They know the depths of the technology they helped create and aren't expected to go into a vast array of other topics.  A simple ""I don't have that information, but can ask"" is understandable when you talk to an engineer.  When you speak to a VIP of the business side of the product and they dodge a question it can seem off-putting.      

These figure-heads can seem excited about how people will like their product, and it is infectious whether you care about what they speak of or not. 

Just to show the difference: At the Xbox One announcement and E3 we got some business guys saying ""cloud.""  At Build we got a Service Architect from 343 Studios talking about how cloud PaaS is revolutionizing how they can communicate with gamers.  He was excited.  The information he presented was accessible and would have taken very little to make more non-coder friendly.

Out of all the issues that arose early, IMO.

So let me ask everyone this, of which he probably knows little, seems less meaningful than hearing a major developer.  Or perhaps you believe a slick figure-head is the better way to go, due to their wider business knowledge and speaking experience?  Do you have another idea?  How do you think this would effect your perception of Xbox One and Microsoft?    

As a side-note

EDIT:  The 343 Service Architect is at http://channel9.msdn.com/?wt.mc_id=build_hp   starts at 3:25:00.  It's a tad on the technical side but could have fairly easily been worded for a non-developer crowd.     
EDIT 2: Sorry for the verbosity -- downloading the Visual Studio 2013 Preview so I can start writing some apps ;)

1372325852.0,1h63ww,Some needed clarification on Xbox One's memory,UKPC,53,18,113,"I've noticed some information going around about the Xbox One's memory lately that has been bugging me

 * Microsoft has locked developers to only 5GB of memory
 * Xbox One only has 68.3 GB/s bandwidth

Let me address these two things below.
***
###5GB/3GB Nonsense

From what I can gather, but he neither confirmed nor denied. Truly, if you have a valid source where someone from Microsoft specifically states this information, tell me. Until then, when Ars Technica [interviewed Matt Booty](http://arstechnica.com/gaming/2013/05/how-the-xbox-one-draws-more-processing-power-from-cloud-computing/), General Manager of Redmond Game Studios, he had this to say about Xbox One's memory:

&gt;The 8GB of RAM in the Xbox One is accessible as one unified chunk and can be divvied up between the GPU and the CPU dynamically. ""Different kinds of games will want to use the CPU, Booty said. ""If we were to try to determine ahead of time how you wanted to divide RAM up between video RAM, main RAM, and audio RAM, we’re making a lot of assumptions, and when you make assumptions you start to limit the people who are going to be making games going forward.""

###Memory Bandwidth

If you cant afford 499 then you probably shouldnt even be spending 399 folks. 100 price difference over the course of one generation of consoles is a bargain for a truly innovative console with new ideas and ways to game and interact online.

I've been basically glued to the Xbox One since the beginning rumblings of the console and have watched and understood Microsoft's plan for the system.  However lately due to the reversals that were caused by the community itself that same community is turning their backs on the system and saying it no longer has a identity.  This is false in my mind as the Xbox One still has the original identity that the Xbox always strives for and that is to be the center device for your living room.

Now we have outlets such as Gamespot even repeating such drivel while using 4:1 Netherlands sales as facts for sales in every region.

[The Point - Why The Xbox Is Losing](http://www.gamespot.com/shows/the-point/?event=why-the-xbox-is-losing-20130814)

All of Microsoft's back pedaling so far was done for the community and their fears and the decisions they made will help them as they go further.  Microsoft has already said they wish to continue their plans on some of the features removed from the first policy reversal including the Family Share Plan. 

[Adam Sessler - Xbox One's Indie Surprise](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uG8zcMRUOHI)

Even Adam Sessler said that he couldn't find any mention that Microsoft would never support Xbox One self-publishing for Indies.  I went even further and tracked down the most likely quote that this idea was true and that they said specifically no to self publishing and found that not to be true.

[Xbox One won't allow indies to self-publish games](http://www.shacknews.com/article/79309/xbox-one-wont-allow-indies-to-self-publish-games?utm_source=dlvr.it&amp;utm_medium=twitter)

&gt; ""as of right now

&gt; ""I would also expect that for this new generation, to bring digital content to the box."" - Matt Booty

As can be seen in the quotes above even Microsoft on May 22nd said they will be continuing to explore new business models and never said they wouldn't specifically support self-publishing in the future.  Should this really be considered a reversal of their policies when they had no policies saying they wouldn't on Xbox One?

Now we move onto Kinect where people continue to forget that from the very beginning you were capable of turning all the features off(even Xbox On) and Microsoft basically took the extra step and are now allowing people to disconnect the Kinect.  This in the end helps Microsoft sell more consoles by alleviating NSA fears while still selling a Kinect with every console.  Microsoft has come out again and put their foot down on the Kinectless bundle not happening and I'm very happy about this even if Gamespot wants to pretend it didn't happen.

[Albert Penello - Kinectless Bundle not happening](http://www.neogaf.com/forum/showpost.php?p=76053443&amp;postcount=338)

I guess what I'm trying to say is that Microsoft hasn't lost it's identity through these changes but only given the community and developers more options on their console and help alleviate the fears of consumers and developers.  Microsoft is continuing to be the more innovative console with unique features and that hasn't changed.

* Visual recognition with seamless profile/controller/settings/orientation switching.

* Voice recognition system that can allow you to turn everything on and enjoy content without having to find a remote control.

* Dedicated servers with a brand new smart match and reputation system.

* HDMI-IN

* Integrated Skype as the main communication service allowing you to chat with anyone that has Skype.

* Brand new achievement that can continually add achievements and challenges throughout a games lifespan.

* Stereo audio through headsets using a single cord with 24 Khz up/down 16-bit uncompressed audio.

* $100

* Nearly inaudible console that is built with reliability first.

When I look over the facts in my mind I find it funny how people think the Xbox One no longer has a identity or unique features...

*Best Case Scenario:* Simulators have a lot of intangibles. We hope Zoo Tycoon has the ones that make things like management and building more fun than looking at spreadsheets. Kinect integration could make interactions more fun (this is the developer that made Kinectimals).

*Worst Case Scenario:* More of a Thrillville than a Rollercoaster Tycoon.

I understand people see it as a pointless brick that will be mandatory for the Xbox One to function. I can see how people are paranoid that the Kinect will track your voice and “spy” on you

I see the reason for hate and complaints; however, realize that the Kinect is the perfect EXCUSE to buy the Xbox One. I most likely will not be using the features but my family will love it, at least for a small period of time. So when I go to buy the Xbox One I will show my wife all the “cool” features of the Xbox One and it will make the purchase a lot easier.

I know I am going to get grief about people saying I should not have to justify the purchase if I was a “real man” and blah blah blah. I realize this and I would be buying the system either way but it will be much easier if my wife is on board and excited for it too.

That is why I am glad the Kinect is bundled with the Xbox One

1371065938.0,1g7sz3,XB1: I'm actually looking forward to moving forward!,whyunoname,68,38,39,"I want to first talk about the last launch.  The price of the PS3 was $599.  360 was $100 dollars cheaper.  Zero fucks given.  A big deal was made regarding the PS3 having Bluray.  You can do more like watch movies!  Fast forward to the current release.  PS4 -- we just want gaming, now if you want the good features then you have to pay.  I'm not bashing either I'm just pointing out the same thing was reversed last time and it was Pro-Sony.

I feel the XB1 is cutting edge, but not backed by 300K+ Azure servers for [cloud](http://arstechnica.com/gaming/2013/05/how-the-xbox-one-draws-more-processing-power-from-cloud-computing/) computing.  It won't be a major difference at launch, but down the road it could really make the XB1 powerful removing any performance limitations and future-proofing it.  This is a massive advantage to XB.

I'm not a huge fan of the online check-in

I LOVE the steam approach.  I think it will bring the devs more money, Netflix, etc, etc.).  It's the natural progression and will happen on all systems in time.  MS just decided to do it now.

The idea of it being gaming only?  Why?  If it can do more and still match the others consoles gaming performance then it's a win.  Don't need it?  Then don't use it.

I just don't understand all of the hate.  I think the PS4 and XB1 will both be fantastic

Edit: Added cloud reference and removed the cable box.  The ability to use XB1 as another box may be added on a later date but right now it is just a pass-thru.

1376696413.0,1kiqxr,Dear Microsoft: TIMESPLITTERS 4,Notramagama,49,21,19,"Microsoft, Timesplitters is the FPS people need right now. Everyone is tired of serious/COD like shooters. Timesplitters may be the best comedic shooter of all time. It is also a well respected series which would let gamers know Microsoft knows what type of games make for a diverse hardcore lineup.




On a side note I had the idea of what a potential plot for a Timesplitters EXCLUSIVE sequel.
Since the game uses Sergeant Cortez as its main character and Timesplitters 4 has been delayed forever it would make a great joke to make the plot of the new Timesplitters be Cortez ensuring Microsoft reaches its title as a huge gaming company, Crackdown, Dead Rising, Mass Effect and any other large console exclusive necessary for Microsoft to be so big. He could team up with Master Chief or Marcus Phoenix to ensure they save their universes... just a thought for a great exclusive story line. This is also only possible on Xbox since its the only system with enough exclusive shooters in a gritty universe




Anyway... PLEASE BRING US(ME) TIMESPLITTERS 4!!!! MS + CRYTEK is the perfect formula for the long awaited sequel to one of gamings best forgotten franchises.

Here are our platform policies and capabilities for game licensing – all of which will be made available when Xbox One launches later this year:

•Buy the way you want—disc or digital—on the same day: You’ll be able to buy disc-based games at traditional retailers or online through Xbox Live


•Access your entire games library from any Xbox One—no discs required: After signing in and installing, while you are logged in at your friend’s house, you can play your games.


•Share access to your games with everyone inside your home: Your friends and family

•Trade-in and resell your disc-based games: Today, or consumers for enabling transfer of these games.


•Give your games to friends: Xbox One is designed so game publishers can enable you to give your disc-based games to your friends. There are no fees charged as part of these transfers. There are two requirements: you can only give them to people who have been on your friends list for at least 30 days and each game can only be given once.

Gamers are concerned with games, despite how many enraged trolls on the internet say differently.

However, they already know that, and I'm fairly certain that they don't need some kid from the internet to tell them that. I predict that we will see some *big* stuff at E3. Some *very big* stuff. [We've already gotten a peek at what's to come,](http://www.polygon.com/2013/5/24/4362060/xbox-one-box-art-style-forza-motorsport-5) and that's just the tip of the iceberg.

Now, and to explain it to you we are going to look to Disney. The Walt Disney Company is perhaps one of the smartest conglomerates out there, and I wouldn't be surprised if Microsoft has taken note of their ways after seeing the recent Xbox One announcement.

One of Disney's seven fundamental business concepts states that *""the competition is anyone the customer compares you to"".* This concept is probably why [the Disney Cruise Line](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disney_Cruise_Lines) is a thing. Walt Disney World and Disney Land had already tackled the theme park market, customers were going on cruises. The solution? The Disney Cruise Line. The customers are free to do what they want, but Disney still makes a profit.

So how does this relate to the Xbox One at all? Well, Rokus, Apple TVs, and iPads. The competition is anyone the customer compares you to. Microsoft doesn't care about what kind of media you are consuming, they just care about how you consume it. They want you to boot up your Xbox One instead of your Roku to finish that Breaking Bad binge. They already know that you're going to use your Xbox to play games; that part is taken care of. They just want to be sure that you're going to use your Xbox to consume all of your other media. That's why they are going to such extensive lengths to highlight the Xbox One's media capabilities.

Hopefully that clears things up. I promise you

1. UI Control. Imagine coming Home and saying ""Xbox on""  ""Smartmatch Halo 5"" ""Watch HBO"" ""Order Pizza"" ""Dim lights"" (using one of the Windows 8 home automation apps) all while making yourself a drink. That is pretty damn cool and you can bet Microsoft is going to market the shit out of this to mainstream consumers. People will WANT this.

2. In game voice control. Does this need explanation? A quick

3. Body capture. Head tracking in Forza. Using your spine as a third analog stick. Games that react to your heartrate and emotions. And yes, probably getting it featured on daytime talk shows. I can't imagine the PS4 making a big splash on Good Morning America. 

I saw a thread in Neogaf where people were lamenting how Sony killed their camera, regardless of a 100$ price difference. Which one ends up being the main console and which one collects dust comes down to the experience. Graphics and games are going to be pretty similar for the most part. The defining difference between the two consoles is going to be the Kinect.

**Advantage of Family Share**

* 10 friends in a circle can play any games in your *shared library* 
* It is a circle of 10 friends
* Only one person can play a game at a time. (Think of it as a real disc)
* Multiple people can play different games in your shared library at the same time.
* No time limit + cloud save so when they buy their own copy they can continue.

**Restriction**

* You can not play your own game when your friend is playing it.
* Your ""shared library"" has a maximum of 5 games. You checkmark the 5 games to place into your library. Games can be put in and taken out at anytime when the game is not being played.
* Total of 50 games can be share between friends at one time (5 * 10).
* Games in your ""shared library"" **CAN NOT** be played offline. 
* To access ""shared library"" games (yours or your friends) you must be online.

**Problems**

* Publishers will fear that there are too many games being shared. 50 is a lot of games. MS can shrink the circle to 5 ending up with 25 games being shared between 5 friends. 25 game is still alot and this could make the publisher happier.

**Why this will work out**

* Allowing only 1 person to play the game at a giving time will discourage people from sharing that game. Players will put a game in the share library but not for long since they want to be able to play it without being locked out. Meaning others will have to buy their own copy.
* This type of sharing will be great for multiplayer games. It will get the player's friend to enjoy it and will want to make them buy it to play against each other.
* If publishers want to get rid of used games
* Everyone will be happy. Play digital games offline, sell disc games, lend disc games, online only if you want to share. It's all there! This is about choices and you are giving it to the consumer!

You do not need 24hr online check in since you must be online to play the games you selected to be in your *shared library*.  For games that you play all the time and don't want to be locked out of, you wouldn't want to lend a disc to a friend if you are playing it everyday. The choice is yours to make.

A game

You begin exploring this unusual world, heart beat calm and steady.

And the game knows this. It sees you in this state. And it begins it's assault.

Your senses are bombarded with noise

Your body notices as well. You lean towards the tv and grip the controller. Your blood starts pumping with your increased heart beat. Your breathing becomes heavier and your skin is flushed. 

And the game sees this.

The game ramps up the oddness. More visual flashes of things just barely there

The game sees this. It has brought you to the edge. You are now ready

But the game brings you back down. It stops the weirdness, a drink, your phone, a noise you heard.

The game sees you do this. Now is it's chance.

And just as you glance back at the tv

Welcome to Kinect.

All of this in game madness has driven you to pause the game. you need a break. Youre sitting on the couch and calming down. Your in need of a bathroom break

You begin your walk to the bathroom, standing in the corner. A quick flash of the character model is all it would take and you'd scream. Still caught in this game even when away from the tv, even when you thought you were safe.




This model can be applied to any horror type game. Imagine an Aliens game. A prequel to Aliens

Perhaps your playing dead space, kinects sees you as you look back at the tv, and hits you just as your focusing back on the game.

Imagine the world of possibilities for horror games, it uses you to control the game based on your body language, heart rate etc. Imagine that the L4D ""director"" is your subconscious, and the game uses your fear against you to make a truly unique experience.

This Polygon interview with Marc Whitten talks a bit about licensing and the new Home Gold system

His wording is a bit confusing and kinda masks what's happening in the background so

**Licensing and Game Sharing**

Mr. Whitten (can I call you Marc?  Thanks Marc) is saying that, too.  We just haven't really thought about it that way because the game itself and the game disc (the license) were tied together.  So before when you were letting a friend borrow the game disc, he was getting the game *and* the license to play the game at the same time.

It's the reason that you couldn't install a game to the HDD and play it sans the disc.  The disc is what tells the system you have the right to play the game.  When you let your friend borrow the disc

Now with digital licensing

What this means is that the license and the game itself aren't actually tied together physically anymore.  The problem is, developers, and Microsoft themselves to lose money due to gaming of the system?

Originally

Now that the check-in has been removed

Without a mandatory check in time, they've had a hard time figuring it out.  I say this from the position of knowing Steam has been working on this for a while now and nothing has come out regarding it.

So that's what my buddy Marc is talking about regarding the licenses.  He's expressing that, so they're essentially ""back to the drawing board"" in order to get a major goal of the digital marketplace back to the public.

Speaking of gaming the system and trying to prevent it while still giving people the benefit of the intended system...

**Xbox Live Home Gold**

My boy M.W. goes on to talk about the sharing features of XBL Gold.  Again, though, was that as the digital medium spread, the old model for XBL started to become antiquated, and again they ran into this problem of ""how do we allow a sharing of a license without turning the whole system we've built on its head?""  The answer is, it's incredibly hard to.  So instead of completely revamping the system that people were in the middle of during the generation, they went the band-aid method of ""let's see what we can fix until we have an opening to change the system.""

The band-aid for this system ended up being only half of the licensing that games currently have.  Instead of the license being tied to the console and the account

The problem they ran into was gaming of the system.  People who were not in the same household and who weren't using the same console were going in together to get discounted subscriptions.  This was countered by the subsequent accounts not having certain purchasing power or settings power

Now that there is a new generation about to start

They can't change the way it currently operates on the 360 since Gold is now going to be a shared system across consoles... so they are giving away a year of XBL gold, and are lifting the restrictions of the child accounts.

Again, while screwing themselves in the long run by having Gold act differently depending on the console?  They would open themselves up to a family pack giving out 4 licenses for 4 total consoles instead of just 4 accounts if those 4 accounts under a family plan were to all upgrade to an XB1.  That would mean that up to 20 people could have a year of XBL Gold for $100.  Or $5 each.  The gaming potential is staggering.  Something had to happen to allow the new, better sharing system to exist on the XB1.  It just so happens to cause some pain to the people who were benefiting, either legitimately or illegitimately, with the family pack.  Their solution was to offer a promotional period of free XBL Gold to compensate the change.  A change that needed to happen.

tl;dr - M-Slice Whitten is talking about expanding digital licensing on games to allow sharing them without gaming and without a mandatory check in period.  He also talks about how XBL Gold is now evolving to share the licensing structure of digital content and how it's necessary to cut off family accounts.",self,t5_2xbci,1376153790.0,,empty-xbox-day-one,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/xboxone/comments/1k3gcs/a_more_in_depth_breakdown_on_marc_whittens/

If the xbox dev that did the AMA was a lying OP then the family plan was to share full access to games(minus no more than one at a time and whatnot) and that would be cool. What if they did this for movies as well. If you decide or your friend or brother that is on your family sharing plan buys a movie all the people on the plan can watch the movie (in this view as well with the whole in a movie theater like view)

However there has to be a trade off. Maybe the original buyer of the movie has to pay if more than say 4? people were watching the movie at his house he had to pay maybe a dollar or two more. The ~~evil eye of Sauron~~ kinect could tell that. (however it wouldn't count people if kinect recognizes a person as a gamertag tagged to your family plan) Also any people on your family plan has to pay a couple bucks if more than two people on their end are watching the movie as well?

I'd say price it at 299$ and sign up for xbox live for 2 years at 16$ a month. That isn't too large of a cost per month and would end up with the final amount paid for the console being 683$.

That seems expensive

A 299$ upfront price would compete with the much cheaper Wii U and would encourage people to buy an xbox one over a ps4.

Not only that, that would be a higher install base for games as well.

I think they could really do well if they did that. ",self,t5_2xbci,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/xboxone/comments/1h4kwu/if_a_subsidized_xbox_one_was_available_would_you/

Ideally, you have the option to ""rent"" any title on the console. Considering the license mechanics we know about, this should be easy enough for microsoft to do. Once you choose to ""rent"" a title, you gain a temporary license to the game and are allowed to digitally download that title (but no other titles until you ""checkin"" your current rental) Once you are done, you ""checkin"" the title, and the license is revoked by the cloud. 

Alternatively

In order to prevent cannibalizing sales

This functions very similarly to GameFly, and there is no worry about getting charged for damaged disks / late returns. Currently, you currently cannot rent xbox live arcade games, only physical releases. With this system, you could rent the new generation equivalents of Bastion or Defense Grid and play those, unlike what is currently available.

* Let me just get out of the way that I have and most likely always will have a stable internet connection at home as well as at work

* To be honest, and I'm sure like many of you, who have even more friends in different cities or countries will be able to freely share games with them, and I believe even still play the very games that you Shared; an option impossible on a physical disc based format. 
* Do I really have to remind Reddit how much the used games industry sucks, not how much it sucks to be the one trading the game in for next to nothing. 
* Which brings me to this, these companies will be able to price their games at their true value, hopefully between $5-$30 instead of the industry standard of $60 right now. Now if we don't see this value on the consumer side in the future, it's true we are definitely being exploited by massive amounts of greed.

* One of my biggest grievances with Xbox One was the required install of a Blu-Ray based disc, meaning you can store all of your games, music, movies, etc. on a high capacity external drive and your storage worries are completely over. 

The only issues I am finally left with are the facts that I am excited about more exclusives on the Sony side than Xbox, I just am not a huge fan of what they did with it in the past as far as games and functions go. I am hopeful however that they're seriously going to deliver me a Minority Report-style experience while commanding my tv, movies, music and games all together at once from the same machine while I sit my lazy ass right there on the couch. Gone are the days of disc-swapping, or searching for different controllers/remotes to perform different functions between entertainment devices. I just preordered my Day One Edition Xbox One on Amazon and I couldn't be more proud of it. I will also be buying a Playstation 4, as I need some Infamous, Killzone, I'm just really fucking excited for this new generation of gaming and I hopefully wish you all do your own research and thinking about which system is really the future device for you



Also please feel free to comment on any issues I didn't bring up here as I'd love to discuss them with all of you. 

EDIT: Another thing I wanted to address was Microsoft's online capacity in terms of the Xbox One versus the 360. For the 360,000 servers.

Microsoft are moving the industry towards a digital model

Xbox One has cloud computing, velocities, collisions, all rendered remotely to take the load off the Xbox itself. It has an intensely responsive and upgraded kinect, which Gizmodo reported is essentially like having extra buttons on your gamepad, its that accurate. Think of selecting spells from a visual menu on screen rather than going through a huge scrolled list in Skyrim. Smartglass as well.

All those features (and the features on the PS4 for that matter) come from the profits of licensing video games, comes from the profits of the video games industry.

Sure, Tomb Raider in the UK is 50% cheaper than it was at release, after just a few months. Used games are negligibly cheaper than buying new around release time anyway. I simply don't get the uproar about it, especially a few of my friends who don't even buy used games, seemingly getting angry about it on others behalf. 

TL;DR - I would rather see 100% of the profits go back into the video games industry, HMV, Virgin Megastores, all going bust in the UK).

1375366119.0,1jht6h,Xbox One App Discussion,Angry_Gnome,27,4,41,"Now that we know that the Xbox One will have a full fledged App Store similar to the Windows 8 store we should start talking about what kind of non-gaming apps we would like to see on the system. These apps should leverage both the incredible power of the Kinect 2.0 and the Xbox One’s internals. The developers of these apps must take care to design the apps with the living room in mind rather than just be copies of phone and tablet apps. Here are a couple of ideas that could help get this conversation started:

**Weather Apps**: How cool would it be to find out the weather from the dashboard of the Xbox One? You could even ask Kinect what the weather is and it could direct you to this specific weather app.

**Movies App:** Have you ever been sitting in the living room talking about going to see a movie with friends but have no idea what is playing around you? With the Xbox One you could simply look at the movie app to see local listings or even ask the Kinect to purchase tickets for you!

**News Apps:** These apps could be designed for reading news on a big screen TV. Similar to Flipboard they could be very visual with plenty of pictures and video to make the news experience interactive and enjoyable in the living room.

**Music Apps:** What if you could have Spotify on your Xbox One? You could queue up your favorite playlist in the background while playing a multiplayer game of Battlefield 4.

**Business and Office Apps**: Because Microsoft is marketing that the Xbox One could be used in a business setting it makes sense that the full office suite should work on the system. Imagine giving a powerpoint presentation and swiping through the slides using kinect. The effect could be a very immersive and simple way to give presentations.

**Smart Home Apps**: What if you could ask your Kinect to turn off the lights in your living room or to turn up the temperature? With smart home apps like WeMo or Nest on the Xbox One we could control our entire house all from the comfort of a couch.

**Social Media Apps:** Facebook and Twitter are no brainers

Really the possibilities are endless for apps that people can make on the Xbox One. I think the mandatory Kinect on every system will ensure that these apps are designed with the living room in mind and not be just simple web apps. I think that this will propel the Xbox to be the first class system for app development

**TLDR: Non-gaming Apps on the Xbox One are going to be amazing

My only problem is with the current achievement system. Pretty much all games - now a days - come with DLC post release and with DLC comes achievements. The current achievement system does not separate DLC achievements from the game's default achievements but instead it mangles them in this never ending list of untitled, as an achievement whore, is a kind of upsetting. That one time I 100%'d Skyrim's achievements was awesome, but the game only stayed on the ""completed"" list of games for a short while. Once the DLC came out the game disappeared from that list and went back to my backlog of NOT completed games. To that I was upset because it was as if all my hard work had been gone. 

The trophy is not in the display case anymore guys.
