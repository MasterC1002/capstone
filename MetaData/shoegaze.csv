I am typing this right after having experienced 'Loveless'.

I am still shaking

I loved every single second of this amazing masterpiece

It drained me. It fucking destroyed me.

I am also rather sad that I will never get to experience this orgasmic piece of music for the first time ever again.


Thank you to Kevin Shields, Colm Ó Cíosóig and everybody who worked on this album, with this band, anybody who worked with them outside of their music, who saw them in concert and especially you magnificent bastards here on Reddit.

I love you guys. 

I sit here in complete silence

Was it good for you?

**EDIT 1** So this was originally written in an ecstatic daze of the moment right after hearing it. Though I still love this album a lot

**EDIT 2** 'Isn't Anything' had it's moments

IDK

**EDIT 3** 'Isn't Anything' has grown upon me

**EDIT 4** It's been a while since I made this post but I'd like to say that since this post MBV has become an all time favorite band. I'm absolutely in love with them.

There wasn't much of that growing up

So I've been recording guitar soundscapes since around 1992 or so, like the Azusa Plane, Flying Saucer Attack, Glenn Branca, and others, so I slowed down in order to hear their awesomeness.

Anyway, no vocals, just sonic guitar. If you enjoy this, check out my [other m2 records](http://www.ericsanjuan.com/m2index.html).

Yada yada...

Hope you enjoy!

That show was absolutely RIDICULOUS. LATSFG were incredible

The Telescopes were totally wild

Got a [set list](http://imgur.com/8twGs3v) and everyone signed it! (except the super rad third guitarist who was busy taking photos with people). Yes

Everyone in the band was so awesome! Really down to earth and just psyched to play music. Andy invited me up to LA to see them again tomorrow(today I guess) but I got work and can't afford the gas.

The '*EP's 1988-1991* compilation

I've been really curious to hear them after hearing *Sometimes* on the 'Lost In Translation' soundtrack.

Though I usually try go through an artist or band's discography in chronological order

I feel I should start with *Loveless* mainly due to [seeing this] (http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_ma28en7j6y1rw3wpdo1_500.jpg)

Thank you in advance :)

Im hoping I can meet some new bands and play a full fledged shoegaze show. Also

Over the summer I finally broke down and starting investing in some minimal bedroom studio equipment.  So far

I'm pretty new at mixing.  The biggest problem I have is getting the two guitar parts during the chorus to mix right.  I have the lead part just 1 track, recorded once for each side.  It seems too quiet compared to the lead, though I can hear it if I really try; it clashes with the lead too much for me to turn it up, and I haven't really been able to master eq'ing yet.

Let me know what you think.",self,t5_2qhhx,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/shoegaze/comments/143b0g/original_song_untitled_work_in_progress_and_im/
