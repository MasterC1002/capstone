1369741458.0,1f6zq2,A few tips for farming,enginedriver,130,3,44,"I've noticed a lot of people saying they can't seem to make any money any more

* Put your Town Hall outside your walls and your Storages Inside.

This sounds like the simplest thing ever but you'd be amazed the bases I've seen. If you're constantly being raided for as much as you can farm then you need to put your base outside your walls. That 11 hour shield will protect you when you're not around! The problem with a lot of farming raids is they will often not even 1-star you

* Trophies do not matter. 

This is also a simple concept but especially since the league update I think a lot of people feel the need to climb the trophy count. You really don't. The amount of resources as a bonus you get from a win is really nothing at all and you are much more likely to be attacked the higher up you go. I hover around 1250 and get a decent income.

* Farm the mines whenever you can

Don't always go out looking for those 300, but those stacked up, combined with the fact you can do several of these per barracks-cycle means you'll be up in resources. 

Pay close attention to the collectors and mines and try to go for those when you can as they are always much less defended. If the base has a lower level bank and it's full, quit and don't waste any more troops. 

* Don't use spells unless they have a LOT of money

Each spell costs like 20-25

* Use a good

I've seen a lot of different compositions but have settled on this:

4 Giants
4 Wall Breakers
Half Archers
Half Goblins

Why only 4 Giants and 4 Wallbreakers? Well you ideally want enough giants to tank for the wallbreakers. They are not there to destroy anything. And it takes 2 wallbreakers to get a pink wall down

Why archers AND goblins? Well the archers are used to pick off anything they can from range

You want the fastest barracks-cycle possible to keep the money up

*  Pick your targets wisely

So many people play this game

Here's 1 barracks-cycle of attacks:

http://imgur.com/WWp4ONV

Note the timelog. I managed to farm:

452
438

In one cycle. I pretty much just targetted bases that had all the resources in the mines. You don't always find these of course

Additionally here's my defense log for today:

http://imgur.com/jA69kW8

Notice how I don't really lose any resources at all because I sacrifice my Town Hall a lot.

I'm going to try and explain to those of you who don't understand why everyone is so upset.

What you will find

* those who have been playing for a long time
* people who have spent a fair bit of money on the game (a few hundred dollars)

So..... Why the heck are they so upset?

Well when I first started playing,000 gold a piece. When you were a TH Level 1,2,3,etc... that was a tremendous price for a single piece of wall, but given time, we could see ourselves getting there.

Welcome to my Clash of Clans Strategy Guide. If you're just interested in the good stuff, once it is released. Please do not post this guide without permission (just PM me and ask) and without crediting me. 

I'll try to keep updating this guide, especially in the beginner chapters. Please excuse my [lack of] MSPaint skills. If you have advice, images, comments, suggestions of your own, please feel free to comment and I'll incorporate them.

**1.1: How to Defend your Defenses**   
[Average](http://imgur.com/5a2LW) - [Decent](http://imgur.com/N4Zb5) -  [Best](http://imgur.com/7lLxB)

Walls are good. But walls are not the only part in a super awesome base. The #1 mistake I see new players (or not so new players) doing is placing their defenses so they can be targeted by archers spawning outside of the walls. Don't make this mistake.  
The difference between 'Decent' and 'Great' has to do with the way units decide which building to attack next. It it too complicated to get into here (this 'basics' section) but I think I'll cover it later in more detail.  
The buildings protecting your defenses do matter - Mines/collectors will have more HP than Barracks/Builder's Huts.

**1.2: Overlapping Defenses**   
[Not Good.](http://imgur.com/Hn7oP)

Another common mistake is placing all of your defenses widely spread apart to cover as many buildings as possible. Dies very easily to several giants. Or to groups of infantry

**1.3: Splash Damage: It's your friend!**  

Mortars (and later wizard towers) are your first and last line of defense against mass infantry attacks. A mortar's damage is only limited by how many troops your enemy puts down and how well you funnel them into where you want them. A fully upgraded mortar (level 6,000 gold) will do 45 damage in one shot to the unit it targets. In the same amount of time (5 seconds) an archer tower (level 1, total cost 1,000 gold) will do 55 damage to the unit it is targeting. What does this mean? It means you need to make sure your splash damage defenses are hitting enemies in groups and are protected. How do you get them to hit enemies in groups? Put then in the middle of your base - As soon as the enemy destroy a wall and funnel through it, they will be nice and  bunched up for the mortars. 

**1.3.1: Where should I place my Mortar?**  

Somewhere very protected. Probably in the middle if your base

**1.3.2: Where should I place my Air Defense?**

In the middle of your base. Mass are attacks are rare (due to time to build), but it should be placed in the middle of your base. More specifically, it should be placed such that, if a mass balloon attack comes, It won't be the first, second, or third defense they kill.

**1.4: Don't try to stuff everything inside your walls**  
[Not Good.](http://imgur.com/YHSvB)

As a counter point to 1.2: Overlapping Defenses

**1.4.1: What should I keep outside my walls?** 

Absolutely keep your builder huts, and Spell Factory outside your walls. None of these matter if they get destroyed - no progress or resources are lost.  
Next I would keep out Army camps, make sure they are your highest level ones.  
What does that leave? Town Hall, Gold Storage. All of these should be inside your walls and as protected as possible. If you are at a stage in the game where you don't care about trophies, you can also kick your town hall outside the walls. You will be easy to defeat, but if you're only trying to protect your resources then the town hall takes up a lot of space.

Therefore I propose a few ideas to address this by allowing more resources into the game and a greater flow of them as well.



1) A new gold mine and elixir collecter added at THs 7,10. This would mean that eventually you could end up with 10 mines and collecters which adds 2/3 to your production rate - this gives a total of 30,000 per hour or 720,000 per day for each resource.

These extra resources will allow for much faster gathering whilst also making it easier to steal a few 10s of thousands from someone who is at work or school and more when they are asleep.



2) Additional levels to mines and collecters. By raising their max level to 15 and increasing the rate of resources produced to 5000 per hour this would also increase production by 2/3 and allow for greater quantities to be gained per day without raiding. This would also give 30

This, school or asleep.

Should both 1 &amp; 2 be combined then it would allow for 50



3) Take off caps on looting storages but reduce the loot % to 10%. This would enable more loot to be stolen from hoarders and so would encourage people to be active but also allow them to get it all back in one raid.

This would mean for every million resources in the storages,000 could be stolen if absolutely full. This would give the incentive to heavily protect storages for non-gemmers whilst allowing trophy hunters to trade storages off for people to not attack their base.

However none of these would greatly reduce the number of gems spent as the uprade times are still very long and so many resources can go unprotected for over a week due to the large amount being accumulated in the mines and collecters so people would gem upgrades so that they could use their resources.



Tell me what you think of these ideas as I believe that they could make a much more active and competitive group of people no matter what the trophy range. Alternatively they could raise each league bonus by at least 10x and add dark elixir at gold 1 which would negate the need for any of the above.",self,t5_2usfk,False,,reddit-clan clan-Rho,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/ClashOfClans/comments/1gn5qk/how_to_balance_the_very_expensive_upgrade_costs/

With that settled, I want to see new content when an update comes out. However, instead of jumping the gun and pointing fingers at 'greedy' Supercell, think about why this update came out.  This will give them a lot of capital to spend on developing new content for the game.  People have begged for 1 on 1 attacks with your friends and Clan vs Clan wars. These are two ideas that are pretty different from the current platform and will take time and money to develop. And with Supercell's [great track record](http://techcrunch.com/2013/03/28/supercell-2/) up to this point, I'll give them the benefit of the doubt for now.

----------

**2.1 Are you a tempting target?**
The best way to not get attacked is to not make it worth your attacker’s time. There are several things that an attacker will likely attack to get

**2.1.1 Large amounts of Loot!**
Loot is the #1 reason people will attack at low levels. If you don’t have much to steal, building spells, starting research, buying defenses (bombs/spring traps), buying decorations (flowers and flags, they will prevent enemy spawning on top of them).

**2.1.2 Having easily accessible loot**
Accessible loot comes in two types - accessible mines/collectors and accessible storage. Both are bad. Make sure your storage is either empty or in the middle of your base. Make sure your mines/collectors are next to your walls (and therefore next to your defenses). Uncollected resources are easier to steal then collected ones - the buildings are more spread out and the buildings have lower HP.

You should also intermix your elixir collections and mines as well as your elixir storage and gold storage. If an opponent really wants your gold, make sure your two gold storage are not next to one another. 

**2.2 Having a Good Base**
See Chapter 1 for details (Common issues: not protecting your defenses, spread out defenses). Also having defenses that are significantly below the ‘normal’ upgraded amount for your trophy count/level. Here are a few more common bases and what I think of each.

**2.2.1 The Standard Base**
The standard base follows all of the rules laid out in Chapter 1 - Defenses and storage inside of the walls, mines, extractors, etc etc etc outside of the walls. There is a single wall dividing your precious base from the hordes of horrors outside. Now What? How can you improve your base? Well this standard base is weak to giants as once they breach your wall, they can attack all of your defenses without delay. It is also weak to mass goblin attacks for the same reason - Once inside they can often outrun splash damage and steal all of your goodies, possibly leaving you with a victory, but with many less resources to spend.

**2.2.2 The Pocketed Base**
This base has the town hall in the center

**2.2.3 The Large Pocketed Base**
This base is a variant on the pocketed base, as it creates a nice spiral with no wasted space or walls. The differences between this as the Pocketed base are minimal. This base type is more common than the Pocked Base at lower levels due to lack of walls.

**2.2.4 The Bulkhead Base**
A Bulkhead Base follows the rules laid down in chapter 1 about kicking unneeded buildings outside of the walls, bases use this strategy to contain (or slow) the flood of enemy troops to the breached bulkhead - Where as a single wall a breach would mean your clan is headed to destruction.

**2.2.5 The Split Base**
A somewhat common (but poor) base defense strategy is grouping your defenses into two groups, but it actually violates the rule of keeping your defenses too spread out. Your defenses should be able to cover each other, ideally as much as possible - keeping them in two groups should be avoided. A split base defense is very vulnerable to giant attacks as they can clean up half of the defenses without taking fire from the other half. Split bases also mean that if *either* side is wiped out, your critical buildings in the center are very vulnerable to a few archers attacking from that side, effectively meaning your base is half as weak as otherwise.

**2.3 Funneling for Victory**   
Funneling is critical to getting the best results out of your splash damage dealing turrets. It basically means using buildings (mostly walls) to make your enemy go where you want it to go

[This is how my current base funnels enemies.](http://imgur.com/ryxhc) 

Proper funneling turns [this](http://imgur.com/9WHvS) into [this](http://imgur.com/uMJF0). 

Do I need to say more? Funneling is also critical to proper trap usage. See section 2.11 below.  

**2.4 Upgrading multiple defenses at the same time**
Your defenses don’t attack if they’re in the middle of being upgraded when you’re attacked! Try not to be upgrading 40% of your defenses at the same time. This is doubly true for splash damage buildings (mortar

**2.5 Having a glaring flaw in your base**  
Such as a spawn point where you moved a turret out of but didn’t put anything back. Or not having an air defense turret. Or putting your air defense turret outside of your walls.  

**2.6 Buildings outside walls are too spread out**  
At higher levels

**2.7 Turret Range Considerations: What can your towers defend?**  
One of the goals of placing less valuable buildings outside of your walls is to slow down your attackers once they are within range of your defenses. NOT to make them spawn farther back - This is of secondary priority. This section covers what that range actually means. Range in this game is also sorta screwed up - Sometimes a turret will decide it can attack a unit standing in a given square

What can and can’t be attacked without taking return fire is summarized in these pics. 

[Cannon - Range 9](http://imgur.com/eyhGF)    
[Archer Tower - Range 10](http://imgur.com/TqtdL)  
Archer - Range 4  

**2.8 Spawn Forcing**  
Spawn forcing refers to forcing your opponent to spawn further away from your important buildings, placing decorations and utilizing natural decorations. It is not recommended to use buildings to force your opponent to spawn further away, as buildings are more useful to delay your opponent once they are in range of your turrets. However, if you spread out your walls in singles (optimal distribution to create a large no-spawn-zone) wall breakers will almost never attack them.  Spawn forcing allows your defenses to kill many wall breakers before they get to your walls if they are unsupported. For other wall breaker defense tips, see decoy walls below. If allowed to spawn directly next to your wall, wall breakers are able to detonate before turrets can strike, even if the wall breaker would normally be one hit by the turret. 

**2.8.1 Trick Spawns**  
Trick spawns are ‘mistakes’ in a spawn forcing situation. Usually a single hole

**2.8.2 Why use trick spawns?**  
Spawn tricks are  fun (I’ve had an opponent put down 31 archers in a trick spawn just to have them all die to a single mortar hit - they didn’t opt to continue attacking). Normally they don’t matter but occasionally they help. If created without care

**2.9 Messing with Wall Breakers**  
Wall breakers are often used in conjunction with giants to get them through the outer walls faster. Here are a few tips to mess with the Wall Breaker AI.

**2.9.1 Decoy Walls**  
Decoy walls are segments of walls of at least 8 that wall breakers will target if they are closer than your real walls. They can also be used to funnel archers and barbarians into taking lots of splash damage from mortars and wizards. Segments of 7 or less don’t seem to work most of the time (seems to be partially based on spawn proximity). If you do further testing and discover any additional details

**2.9.2 Outer walls with Buttresses**  
When used in game they [look like this](http://imgur.com/CVdUs). The wall breaker will attack the buttress rather than the walls. Giants will ignore them and proceed straight to the inner walls. Only once the nearby buttress is destroyed will the Wall Breaker target the main wall. This works especially well with spawn forcing
If you're curious about the name

**2.9.3 Using extra walls for Buffering**  
[Visual of buffering](http://imgur.com/MiCYk)

If you have extra walls you can also use them to protect your defenses from archers. They simple prevent archers from getting close enough to fire

Welcome to Chapter 3, not unlock order. You can skip around and read just the units you care about, but I honestly think you will learn more about how the AI works as a whole if you read it in the order I’ve presented it.

I've also tried to include more images in this chapter and - for the first time - videos! Hope you enjoy them. For the Giants and Balloons section


--------

[**Chapter 1: Base Defense

[**Chapter 2: Advanced Base Defense**](http://www.reddit.com/r/ClashOfClans/comments/12b5xz/clash_of_clans_strategy_guide_chapter_2_advanced/) 

**Chapter 3: Chapter 3: Unit Strengths

3.1 Unit Strengths  
3.2 Balloons - Target: Defenses   
3.3 Giants - Target: Defenses  &amp; Goblins - Target: Resources  
3.4 Barbarians
3.5 Archers &amp; Wizards - Target: Any  
3.6 Healers - Target: Any  
3.7 Wall Breakers - Target: Walls  

**3.1 Unit Strengths**  
Each unit has its own strengths and weaknesses. The main factors to consider are Combat type (range/melee), Defenses, Resources, Walls), Damage per Second, Housing Space, and Cost to train. To a lesser degree, movement speed. **You can see the details of all units** (not just unlocked ones) **by clicking the “i” symbol on each unit in the barracks.**

Here is a very high level summary of each unit. Any special abilities or quirks will be mentioned in the in depth section below.

|Unit|Strengths
|:------:|:-------------------------------|
|Barbarian| Good health
|Archer| Best range, medium cost.|
|Goblin| Great specialty unit (vs resources)
|Giant| Great health, high cost, high housing supply (5), slow to train (2m)|
|Wall Breakers| Low Health, slow to train (2m)|
|Balloon|Low Health, high Damage, medium-slow to train (5m), high housing supply (5), slow movement|
|Wizards| Low Health, High housing supply (4), high cost, slow to train (10m)|
|Healer| Low health, high cost, slow to train (20m), high supply (20)|
|Dragon| High Health, High housing supply (20), slow to train (30m), Flying unit, High Cost|
|P.E.K.K.A | High Health, High housing supply (25), slow to train (60m), High Cost|

[Damage types comparison](http://prntscr.com/isn60) (thanks /u/Good_guy_Hult )

[Comparison of Unit Cost, and Health, per 100 supply of units](http://infogr.am/Comparison-of-units-per-100-housing/) (Thanks again to to Hult - really is a good guy! )

**3.2 Balloons - Target: Defenses**  
I’m starting with Balloons because they are the simplest to understand. Because they target defenses and fly (ignoring walls and other obstacles) their path is very easy to predict. All there is to know is that after being placed, resource buildings, army camps, etc etc etc. ONLY look at what the closest defensive structure is (Cannon, Mortar, Archer Tower, Air Defense, X-Bow

Balloons also do splash damage

Some bases are very simple to predict because there is always a “next closest” tower that is very easily identifiable. [Here is an example base that is moderately easy to predict](http://imgur.com/rE0jN) where the balloons are going to go. The circles are the spawn points

Now test yourself:  

Instructions:   

* Open up the [Balloon Practice image](http://imgur.com/jnonk)  
* Pick one of the colored dots.  
* If you placed a Balloon(s) here
* Check yourself against the answer for the color you picked

Interesting Point #1 - Yellow and Blue
After destroying the Archer Tower next to #1, it didn’t hover directly over the Archer Tower, it stayed offset to the side of the mortar, making the balloon slightly closer to the cannon. If you had deployed 10 balloons, there would be some variance. I would expect maybe 2 of the 10 balloons would go after the archer tower rather than the Cannon, but the other 8 would probably go after the cannon.

Interesting Point #2 - Yellow  
After destroying the Air Defense turret, I would estimate a pack of Balloons would split up, some going for one and some going for  the other. Lets see what the math says: (you obviously wouldn’t have time to do this when attacking)

Mortar is centered 4 tiles away on the diagonal (4 up

Meanwhile, or 6.08 units in a direct line.

Therefore

Interesting Point #3 - Orange  
Mortar is 4 up, total 4 units. See mathy explanation in interesting point #2.

**3.3 Giants - Target: Defenses  &amp; Goblins - Target: Resources**  
Giants and Goblins are two units that are very good at what they do: taking out Defenses and Resources

So after reading section 3.2 about Balloons, even if it has to kill a wall first, if the father target is more than roughly 15-20 steps away. Both Goblins and Giants operate exactly the same, except for their target.

IMPORTANT: Once it decides to attack a wall to get to their target on the other side, you can use a wall breaker to destroy a nearby wall.

In practice, you don’t need to predict exactly where the giant is going to go during the entire match, just until it takes out the critical building you’re aiming for (typically mortar if you’re a lower level player).

You should also be thinking about other situations - What would happen if when the pack of giants was HERE, to the Giants then perform better because they take a different route? [This picture](http://i.imgur.com/VjVjI.jpg) is an example of combining several units and timing their attacks to coordinate. 

[Picture of giant path finding in simple base](http://imgur.com/ChU4K)

Now test yourself:  

Instructions:   
* Open up the [Giant Practice image](http://imgur.com/soQHC)  
* Pick one of the colored dots.  
* If you placed a Giants(s) here
* Check yourself against the answer for the color you picked

I actually attacked this base

[Here is a video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=WdanGH9e8jA) of attacking a different base with giants and having to predict where they are going to go.  Relevent section ony starts [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=WdanGH9e8jA#t=260s).

**3.4 Barbarians
Barbarians, soaking tons of damage, while dealing a very respectable amount themselves. The only ‘tactic’ for using these units is to make sure whatever the nearest target is is the one you want them to go for. This means you might deploy some barbarians to clear out some buildings outside of the enemy walls and  some giants to break open the wall, then you can deploy more barbarians and if the closest target is within the walls, they will happily march through the hole you already created. You can see an enemy attempting this on a small scaler scale against me in [this video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vCsFmjObJY) [Relevant section: 1:08].

**3.5 Archers &amp; Wizards - Target: Any**  
Archers and Wizards, what they target is fairly simple - the closest target that they can reach.

However, reachable, target. Archers can’t shoot over a wall followed by two empty spaces, followed by the building in question.


**3.6 Healers - Target: Any**  
Healer AI goes for the nearest (usually) hurt ally and heals them until they are fully healed or dead, so don’t try to use them on Balloons, Dragons, or other healers. The most important feature about healers is their ability to cast in an Area of Effect - so they heal all units within a fairly significant radius of their target. They do not automatically heal clusters, of hurt units, unfortunately, so hopefully the single guy the healer locked onto is staying with the clump. The Area of Effect is twice that of a wizard tower and half that of a mortar (although mortar has damage drop off farther from center).

As they are flying units

[Example video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=WdanGH9e8jA) of Healer switching targets when full. Attack starts [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=WdanGH9e8jA#t=260s) and healer section starts [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=WdanGH9e8jA#t=307s) if you want to skip to the specific part. Same video from Giant section

Current Prices vs. What I think they should be:

**CURRENTLY:**

Lvl. 1: 200 gold

Lvl. 2: 1

Lvl. 3: 5

Lvl. 4: 10

Lvl. 5: 30

Lvl. 6: 75

Lvl. 7: 200

Lvl. 8: 500

Lvl. 9: 1

Lvl. 10: 3

Lvl. 11: 4

vs.

**WHAT I THINK THEY SHOULD BE AND WHY** (some are the same):

Lvl. 1: 500 gold (200 is too cheap)

Lvl. 2: 1

Lvl. 3: 5

Lvl. 4: 10

Lvl. 5: 30

Lvl. 6: 60

Lvl. 7: 125

Lvl. 8: 250

Lvl. 9: 500

Lvl. 10: 1,000,000)

Lvl. 11: 2

I think they should be lowered because of the overall total cost of walls per TH. For example,000,000** gold JUST to get all 225 walls from lvl. 6 walls to lvl. 7. With the improved prices it will cost **28,125,000** from lvl.6-7. THAT'S STILL A TON! and to go from lvl.7-8 walls it costs **112,500,000**. Correct me if I'm wrong, lvl7-8 walls would cost a total of **56, greed! So Supercell

**EDIT**: If the walls are too strong for the low price

**EDIT#2**: Some may not have noticed, but not cheap enough to cause everyone to upgrade their walls. The adjusted prices are still large enough, so you can feel ""proud"" of your walls. And for the people that have already upgraded their walls, that's too bad. This idea is balanced and follows a pattern that makes sense, rather than a 250% price raise.",,False,t5_2usfk,True

* Remember to follow [**reddiquette**](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette). [HIMB] posts have been getting a lot of flak. In these posts OP is asking for advice. Badly designed bases should **not** be downvoted. Comment the reasons why you dislike the design

&gt;Do not downvote an otherwise acceptable post because you don't personally like it. Think before you downvote and take a moment to ensure you're downvoting someone because they are not contributing to the community dialogue or discussion. If you simply take a moment to stop, you will ensure that your downvotes are given for good reasons.

* Check out the [**Updated Clan Directory**](http://www.reddit.com/r/ClashOfClans/wiki/official_reddit_clan_system)! 

* New mods!  [We are still looking for more!](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1I0k4rBSMDnC4zp4pZ18_tmxX46tP8Y5cO1R0CH1-ZGw/edit) Currently we're looking for moderators with CSS experience.

* say we have a base layout that we want to completely rearrange. We then select a wall and press a ""collect all"" button

Some history:

* Past: 20 gems for 6 hours of x2 production

6 hours boosting grants you 6*3000=18

Thats approx **900** resources per gem.

* Currently: 11 gems for 24 hours of x2 production

1 day boosting grants you 24*3000=72

Thats approx **6545** resources per gem.

While this might seem little to most of you,000 resources (best value) it would cost 2467 gems.

Thats a mere **3243** resources per gem. Thats exactly 2 times more of a bang for your buck.

Sadly

**TLDR:** Boosting is awesome now! if you have spare gems after purchasing 5 workers

EDIT: Requested by Linushz

Currently...DE with gems its **35** de per gem. (200k for 5667 gems)

With the new boost: (ill only do lvl3 and lvl6 for th8/9 respectively)

-lvl 3: 15 gems for 1 day: **72** de per gem! 

-lvl 6: 34 gems for one day

Sadly...in this case...it would take 28 days with 3 maxed de drills to get 200k...but its definitely much cheaper! (2856 gems vs 5667 gems)

1363127674.0,1a6dln,Keep track of your upgrades - a simple tool for your service,azazel_kon,42,4,26,"Dear CoC Community

As most of you know it's a good practice to max out your buildings before moving to the next level of your Town Hall.
But the higher level you become

And after some time of playing tricky games with my memory I decided to somehow automate/simplify this process.
As a result I got a handy Excel document which serves me in some ways:

* keeps track of upgrades left on current Town Hall level;

* provides information about how much time and resources is required to finish all the upgrades;

* serves as mini-wiki providing information about cost and duration of upgrades.


I want to share this tool with all you and hope it will help at least some of you.
[Here it is](https://www.dropbox.com/s/nk24tay292sxloq/CoC.xlsx)


How-to use it:

* set your current Town Hall level (you will find instructions inside how to do it);

* optionally set number of builders;

* set levels of your buildings/troops in appropriate cells (for example

* set number of walls of each level you currently have (for example, then you will see some cells marked with red background);

* enjoy.

How-to read information:

* green cells - you do not need to upgrade this building/troop on your current Town Hall level (either because it is maxed or not available yet)

* yellow cells - you still have some upgrades to do on your current Town Hall level;

* pinkish cells - this upgrade is not yet available for you.


**NOTE:** For the sake of consistency I introduced level 1 upgrades for troops and set their cost ant time to 0. Just ignore it


**DISCLAIMER:** There is no information about Dark Elixir yet. I will probably add it later. Don't ask me when.


**CREDITS:**

Thanks to Supercell for creating this game.

Thanks to http://clashofclans.wikia.com/wiki for information about costs/times.

Thanks to Flammy for his wonderful gameplay videos.

Thanks to all of the members of CoC Community just because it exists.


**TRIVIA:**

To fully build and upgrade your base from TH1 to maxed TH9 you will need:

Gold (without mines/collectors and walls): 275

Gold (with mines/collectors and walls): 277

Gold for walls: 1,000

Elixir (without mines/collectors): 102

Elixir (with mines/collectors): 104

Laboratory upgrades: 84

Build time (without mines/collectors): 983.13 days

Build time (with mines/collectors): 1171.8 days

Laboratory upgrades time: 208.25 d

This numbers might not be absolutely accurate but still they how many efforts this game requires.


**YET ANOTHER DISCLAIMER:**

I'm pretty sure some of you may want to see some improvements/features for this tool.
You can post them in the comments but I'm not very sure I will be able to implement them due to the limited amount of free time.
But maybe I'll try. Who knows? :)
And of course I take no responsibility for any harm/damage done to you or your computer by using this file. :)

Good clashing to all of you!


**UPDATE**

Updated file with dark elixir troops and heroes. Due to lack of information about durations of dark elixir troops upgrades I temporarily put zeroes there. As soon as this information becomes available I'll update the document.

If somebody told the formula of conversion resources/time into gems I would use it to find out how much gems does everything cost :) Don't you think that might be interesting?

They would be similar to Heroes in that they are bigger and separate from other troops, to prevent abuse) when need be. They cannot be upgraded. Here are some mercenaries I came up with

**Lucky Davinian**

Sort of an Irish-themed mercenary

* Unlocked at TH6
* Costs 500
* Does 120 dps
* Attacks with brass knuckles
* Regeneration time: 30 mins
**Lucky Strike:** Every hit
* Has an awesome catch phrase he says randomly: ""Blarney

**Sir Lance Prowder**

The knight-for-hire

* Unlocked at TH7
* Costs 750
* Does 90 dps, has 1300 HP
* Attacks quickly with lance
* Regeneration time: 40 mins
**Spear of Destiny:** up to twice per battle, doing damage to troops and buildings but only in a straight line. 300 damage for first building, 250 for the next, then 200, 150, and so on. The minimum it can do is 50 dmg.
His metal armor would also get him 1.5 damage from teslas
* Catch phrases: ""For king and country!"" ""For honor and glory!"" or other noble stuff 

**Sludge McGruber**

The goblins' discarded secret weapon, growling as he goes.

* Unlocked at TH8
* Costs 1
* Does 140 dps
* Regeneration time 50 mins
* Attacks with sludge he vomits up from short range (2 squares max)
**Toxic Sludge:** once per battle (30 seconds in battle must pass before ability is activated)
* Catch phrase: ""Arrghhhhoooooo"" or equally ravenous growl 

**Isis Raven**

The most feared assassin that ever lived

* Unlocked at TH9
* Costs 1.5 million gold to hire (available for 2 battles)
* Does 140 dps/100 dps
* Regeneration time: 1 hour
* Attacks with assassin's dagger for close targets (140 dps, 4 squares max)
**Nightshade:** Isis has a 40% chance of dodging every attack
**Shadow Run:** Once per battle (40 seconds required before activation)
* Mortars push back/stun Isis more than usual because of her light frame and small stature (unless dodged)
* Catch phrase: ""I am the night

**Commander Yao** (yes, I'm poking fun at Kim Jong-un)

An Asian-themed general determined to win at all costs

* Unlocked at TH10
* Costs 1.5 million gold to hire (available for 1 battle)
* Does 200 dps
* Regeneration time: 2 hours
* Attacks with general's baton (1 square)
**Soldier's Duty:** Any troop within range will jump in front of the Commander and take the hit for him except for splash damage.
**Morale Boost:** Commander Yao has a 5% chance of yelling ""fight harder!"" which boosts all troops on the map's damage by 100% for 15 seconds. They should glow red as a result.
**General's Salute:** Commander Yao has a 10% chance of sending up his own mortar-style bomb (the cannon should just appear beside him) that does 350 splash damage.
**Imperial Force:** (1 minute required before activation, and it resets his HP counter to 1500 no matter what it was at before. The robot will also fly and change position every 15 seconds (this is when dirty bombs are activated, lasers don't work in the air).
* All weapons are automatically focused on Cmdr. Yao if he is in range.

About three or so weeks ago, who had only been a member for a couple of weeks. S1GMA had found that he no longer had the time to manage a clan, so he stepped down and left. Edgearoth then instituted a bunch of unpopular policies:

* He rejected the former leader when he reapplied to join the clan.
* He refused to appoint more than 2 elders (one of whom is practically inactive), before I could get someone to accept her.
* When the Share Replay function came out, because nobody listened to him and shared replays anyway.
* Today

I was an active member. I donated ~3,200 so far this season. I spoke out about all of these issues, and each time, despite having majority support in the clan chat, I was threatened to be kicked. I was never impolite, and I did not ever insult the man (or any other member). All I did was talk about the issues. Well, I guess the dragon issue was the straw that broke the camel's back. When I brought it up, and when I urged him to have a conversation about it

I had a feeling he was going to do something unreasonable

*To my friends in Sigma*: it's been a fun time. I enjoyed talking with all of you

*To Edgearoth*: Who elected you

0.1 First 48 hours  
0.2 48-72 hours 
0.3 Really
0.4 Frequently Asked Questions  
0.4.1 What happens when I'm attacked?  
0.4.2 Trophies?   
0.4.3 Gems?
0.4.4 Resources? (Gold
0.4.5 Shield? 
0.4.6 How do I control my units?  
0.4.7 Why don't I get my units back after a battle?  
0.4.8 OK
0.4.9 Why do I keep getting attacked by one unit?

**0.1 First 48 hours**  
Welcome! You've just started. What now?  
Well if you haven't completed the tutorial, instead you can wait for the constructions to finish on their own or wait for your base to accumulate enough resources. Choice is yours. Likewise, you don't have to deploy all of the wizards. Two will do just fine if you place them next to the cannon. 

OK now what?  
Well for the first 48 hours, gold storage). Be sure you've built all of the gold mines and elixir mines that you can. When you can, upgrade your town hall.  
NOTE: Upgrade your elixir collectors and gold mines from the lowest level to the highest.  
NOTE: Do NOT yet build defenses, etc. yet.  
They are not needed yet. You have a 3 day shield (more on that later) but it basically means you can't get attacked until it runs out. How much time you have left is indicated by the shield counter on the top-middle-right side of your screen. You *can* deactivate your shield early by searching for a multiplayer match under the attack menu. I don't recommend doing so.  Note: do NOT build a second gold storage or a second elixir storage. Wait about a week in game to do that (you'll know when) 

**0.2 48-72 hours**  
OK you've got about 24 hours left on your shield. Now what?  
Start building and upgrading defenses! 

Priority from highest to lowest: 
Mortar 
Archer Tower(s)
Cannon(s) 

This means build and upgrade your archer towers to level 2 before you upgrade your cannons to level 2. 

You can also defend your base with walls. For how to design your defenses

**0.3 Really
DO:  
Upgrade your elixir collectors and gold mines to a high level (level 5 for all of them is a good goal by the end of the 48 hours if you're an active player)  
Upgrade your elixir and gold storage as needed  
Attack the goblins in single player (good income for the first day or two)  

DO NOT:  
Build a second gold storage OR a second elixir storage  
Bother building defenses before the last ~24 hours of your shield  
Attack other players in multiplayer (it gets rid of your shield)  
Spend Gems  (more on this later) 

**0.4 Frequently Asked Questions**  

If you have a question that is not on this list

**0.4.1 What happens when I'm attacked?**  
If you are attacked you can lose your resources and a few trophies (more on trophies later

This means there is NO penalty at all if Army Camps, Walls, or Defenses are destroyed. 

If Gold Mines, or elixir storage is damaged or destroyed, *some* of their resources will be stolen by the enemy. Protect these buildings. 

**0.4.2 Trophies?**   
Trophies are how the game measures skill. Beating an opponent earns you trophies. If someone attacks you and fails

More trophies are earned if the enemy has more trophies than you. More are lost if you lose to someone with less trophies than you. 

**0.4.3 Gems?**
Gems are the premium currency in the game. You can use them to buy extra builder's huts, 7 day), buy resources, boost gold mines and elixir collectors, instantly train troops, boost training rate for troops, or spend them on decorations (pointless). 

Of all of the above, possibly, 4th builder's huts) 

**0.4.4 Resources? (Gold
Gold and Elixir are the two resources in the game. 

Gold is used for buying, elixir storage, defenses, walls, traps, the town hall, the clan castle. It is generally considered more valuable by players as you can instantly spend it on your walls in basically unlimited amounts (Maxing your walls costs a grand total of 164,000 or 164 MILLION gold). Gold can also be used to buy spells once the spell factory is complete. 

Elixir is used for buying, gold storage, army camps, barracks, laboratory and spell factory. It is also used for training units and researching upgrades in the laboratory. 

**0.4.5 Shield?**  
Shields prevent you from being attacked. You get a shield for free every time you are damaged to a significant degree (12 hour for being 40% damaged

You can also buy 1 day

**0.4.6 How do I control my units?**  
You can't. You don't control your units at all once they are placed. Place them near the target you want them to go for. 

Each unit also has a 'favorite target' they will ONLY attack until all of those targets are dead

Units will generally attack the nearest target of their choice. Ranged units and walls slightly complicate this. 

A much more detailed explanation of unit AI and pathfinding as well as unit strengths can be found in [Chapter 3: Unit Strengths

**0.4.7 Why don't I get my units back after a battle?**  
To keep the game balanced. 

Imagine if you got back your super amazing, too. 

It also means you should only place as many units as you need to defeat the current base as to not waste any units. 
 
**0.4.8 OK

Yes

I also don't recommend restarting

To reset do this: 

* Plug your iDevice into your computer and back up via iTunes

* Factory reset your iDevice with iTunes 

* Restore via backup (5-15 min process) 

* Create a new Game Center ID if you had been using one before while playing Clash of Clans and log into it. If you don't have a Game Center account

* Redownload and launch Clash of Clans 

You can also play your village on several devices at the same time. Simply log in with your same Game Center Account on the new device and launch Clash Of Clans. 

**0.4.9 Why do I keep getting attacked by one unit?**  

These are people intentionally lowering their trophy count. As a side effect

1. See who donated which troops. Just by clicking each troop in a clan castle


2. Ability to see if the player is online, and maybe a sword or something like that to show if he/she is attacking. This would be helpful to see if players aren't donating or responding because they don't want to, or if they are offline.


3. Leader messages fix. I am the leader of my clan (The Dan Clan- Im Dirty Dan feel free to join!) and I often wish that I could send messages to individual players or just elders or something like that but the only option is to send a message to everybody. I would just really like to be able to send messages to specific players.


4. Base saving and Self attacking. I switch between different farming bases and trophy hunting bases. It would just be really helpful to be able to save my base
The self attacking is the ability to attack yourself for free


Sorry if some of that didn't make sense Im not very good at explaining and sorry that it is so long! Please leave some comments on what you think about these features.

1373180904.0,1hsjp4,Childish Trophy/Hybrid Update for TH9 is here! TH8/ TH9 -3 Versions. links inside,CHiLDiSH402,38,3,13,"Hello my fellow redditors! I apologize for not being as active as i used to be on the threads but since april i have taken on the role of clan leader have been busy trophy pushs and webpage updates.
That being said
pioneers of youtubers that helped me achieve the level in base designing that i am  at today!! I felt it was my duty to pay it forward and continue to share some of my designs i have created over the past few months. I hope you enjoy!!

Disclaimer: All of my bases are  setup to protect 1 main resource + DE. So yes a few storages
will be exposed.

TH8 Version: CC and DE were swap as at the time i had alot of DE - CC is normally centralized. 
This is design for TH8 players that use only 4 storages + DE
http://i.imgur.com/23HoOwz.jpg

Old Hybrid Version:


http://i.imgur.com/UaGtOYw.jpg
Pros:

-Balanced Point defenses

-Centralized CC! (a pain to do for most hybrids without offsetting everything else)

-Centralized Xbows ( perfect coverage using ground setting)

-Storage prioritization ( 1 regular resource + DE. DE ‘s placeholder is the north gold storage)

-Overlapping Wizard towers @ North side for additional DE protection when it gets high
.
- Adjusted T junctions / Staggered X-junctions to prevent WBers from opening multiple
segments 

Cons:

Offset Splash: Original positions for mortars in TH8 were the 2 northern elixirs but due to having 4 wiz towers vs 3
I relocated them so I didn’t have splash buildings stacked in a position that would also the enemy to take out 2 with 1 set of lightning strikes. With the mortars being just out of range of the most northern segment ( 2 AT/cannon ). Overlapping WTs have been providing good coverage for the DE and surrounding buildings for the time being. 

Exposed ADs on NW/NE side: Initially was intentional and used 2 spring traps behind walls vs a giant healer
rush but I never get attacked with that setup so split up the spring traps between both segments on the top. Spring traps can be setup away from the T-junction as my adjusted walls force the WB to attack that area or around exterior teslas as I have currently.

Update: Hybrid for Trophy Pushing Version A

http://i.imgur.com/ymFSulE.jpg

Swap Elixir for exposed Air Defenses for better protection

Xbows switch to Air for better protection

Additional segmentation on Southside since TH is offset to the south.

Added additional traps within chevron as most attackers are trying to come in from the south. (Remember the chevron is a live target   for WB that are deployed from direct south due to 2 AT and Mortars being perfectly aligned)

Cons: Offset/Unbalanced mortars

Thoughts on this version:

I realized early on that the protection of my storages were not as impt as no one cares for resources in the 2000s so I quickly switched the  AD as Air attacks were the norm and winning every fight. After the switch I did not lose one air fight and lost maybe 3/7 ground fights  depending on how many rage spells they used. ( Most that used more than 3 won


Update: Hybrid Version A to Version B

http://i.imgur.com/oGWBOk9.jpg

Swapped north Air def with wiz tower overlapping coverage on side storages.

Adjusted mortars for better overall  balanced coverage.

Cons: 
Wiz/Mortar susceptible to Lightning strikes making one side week and perfect for attack.

Condensed Air defenses are missing a tad bit of coverage  on far East/West AT and cannon

Thoughts on this version:

So far i'm 3/5 on Defenses from this version but IMO 2 of the attackers didn't know what they were doing so waiting for more defenses to judge.


Overall: Throughout the trophy push the bases held up just under half of their attacks with 3 wiz towrs down and one AD down. When the buildings were up my base held up for about 2/3 of the defensive attacks

Your thoughts on both versions?
Likes and Dislikes?

Stay tuned for the farming version of this hybrid !!

Sorry if this is redundant but I did a subreddit search and didnt find much on this topic so I have been arranging walls for the last 2 weeks to see how troops will behave and whether or not they will go through walls or go around them.  I built the base like this with wall flanges coming out to see if troops will go through the next layer of walls or go around them.  

What I have noticed so far from this exploratory AI base is about where the size of the wall flanges are now.  7-8 wall segments out and the troops will go around the walls to the next pocket of buildings

No one answered him, or tweak/customize thing/add universal things (i.e. adding a specific request txt to the troop request). If they add new lvls they can only do it with with the higher THs. And if they add new buildings, then high lvl buildings (i.e. inferno tower/xbow) should only be added to higher lvl THs, and new buildings (i.e. dark barracks) will be placed where they will be placed. So what are you looking for when you ask for new stuff for lower lvl players?

And if you read other posts in these threads, but there was still THs 7, 8, and 9, and the only things that were added for them were more cannons/archer towers/walls, and 1-2 lvls to upgrade. People would either gem through TH6, stay at TH6 cause the next THs had nothing worth getting (cause of the looting penalties, or just get bored with the endlessness that would be TH6. Either way people would want new things to be added to the newer lvls so they can look forward to something and TH6 wouldnt be balanced at all. 

And as far as I see it, seeing as the real competitive players (i.e. top 10+ players) rage their bombers so lvl 9-11 walls will all break all the same. 

And lastly, please give me a reason as to why you are downvoting it. Cause then if you don't give me a good/legit reason, that myself or anyone else can't prove wrong/unimportant, then you are just like all the other TH6s and below (not all of you, but enough) that are complaining either to look like they are part of something when they dont know anything, or not good enough to make it past TH6. And I've checked the stats, and the majority of those complaining bout this problem are TH6 and below.

Thank you for your time

You're pretty far along"" and they say something like ""That's nooby"" or ""I'm not rushing Town Halls.""  

No.

The Maxing rule is not meant to be taken as ""Upgrade EVERY single thing you possibly can at a town hall level.""  I am a town hall 8, and its fine there because Ive complete all the singleplayer missions and I dont find them useful in attacking.  That goes for troops, but I have even MORE ranting for buildings.

For example, like some barracks to level 7 or something, don't just waste time at a town hall level waiting for them to finish.  So the bottom line is to follow my bottom line rules. (Nice name, 'eh?)

•Upgrade all defensive building before upgrading your town hall!
•Remember you can upgrade stuff WHILE your town hall is upgrading!
•Don't stress over upgrading walls/barracks/Unnecessary troop upgrades

This is something I think is a common wives tale (sort of) that I believe to be untrue.  So please

tl;dr

EDIT: Reading this, and damn, I spent a good ten minutes writing it. Humph.

EDIT 2: The whole purpose of upgrading your town hall earlier rather than waiting, you can now do the magical act of building more defenses and upgrading your current ones.  This way, you can protect your hard earned resources from those nasty level 5 and 6 troops.  So pretty much the thinking is you have to expose yourself to the mean big levels (Ever seen a level 20 on Global complaining about a level 50?) so that you can properly defend against them.

Welcome to Chapter 4, and Town Hall Level. In this chapter I’ll be explaining how matchmaking currently works as well as how this system is screwed up and ripe for abuse.

Once again I’ve been a bit slow at getting this chapter out because I’ve been busy. Between midterms (exams, it has a lot of advice and tips in it, if not in quite the structured environment that this strategy guide provides.

Anyway, more just saying how the system works. As always, please provide feedback (loving or otherwise) as I do appreciate it.

**Chapter 4: Multiplayer: Trophies
4.1 What are Trophies
4.2 How does Matchmaking work?  
4.3 Taking Advantage of the Trophy System  
4.3.1 But I just got attacked by someone XX levels higher than me!  
4.4 Abusing the system: Intentionally ditching trophies  
4.5 Abusing the system even harder: Farming  


**4.1 What are Trophies
Trophies are the golden cups on the top left of your interface, and experience bar. You get trophies for winning multiplayer battles, either offensively or defensively. When attacking, if you get at least one star (50% of base destroyed or Town Hall destroyed) you will get trophies. If you do not get at least one star, you will lose trophies. The amount depends on your relative trophy counts (you vs your opponent). Getting one star results in getting ⅓ of the number trophies listed on the top left when attacking a base (just below the enemy resource count). Getting two stars means getting ⅔ of this amount, and getting 3 stars means you get the full amount. For one and two stars the count is rounded down.

Experience is gained for completing buildings. The amount varies non-linearly depending on the time it takes to complete and the resources it takes to complete (more expensive and slower = more experience). The exact amount of experience can be seen in blue text when a construction completes (similar animation to when collecting gold or elixir, researching units, placing decorations, or buying traps. You also get a small amount of experience for removing natural decorations and destroying enemy town halls (amount dependant on your relative Town Hall levels).

Levels are gained by getting more experience. Level is ONLY good for getting a summary for how much someone has played and does not mean anything for multiplayer. You can appear ‘weaker’ by keeping your level low by under investing in resource collectors  and not collecting achievements (which give experience).

Upgrading the Town Hall results in unlocking more buildings and new buildings. Town Hall level does effect multiplayer in two ways: 

**4.2 How does Matchmaking work?**  
Matchmaking works completely on Trophies.

Level and experience don’t matter. Town Hall Level doesn’t matter (in terms of finding a match). Period. [I took this screenshot a while back when I had about 600 trophies. I was also level 40 or so as you can see from my large army.](http://i.imgur.com/zgriB.jpg) - Think TheDominator stands much of a chance?

Why is this a problem? Because each player can intentionally gain or lose trophies as they desire

The recent patch (2.111

**4.2.1 OMG! I just got attacked by someone XX levels higher than me!**  
Yeah. That is why this system sucks.

**4.3 Taking Advantage of the Trophy System**  
You can take advantage of the system now that you know how it works. Here are a few ideas...

**4.4 Abusing the system: Intentionally ditching trophies**  
As I mentioned

This means you will be in a lot less competitive environment. Those who view your base will often be of lower level. Even if they are also a high level player

**4.5 Abusing the system even harder: Farming**  
Some players take ditching trophies to a whole new level: the farmers. These people drop to very few trophies (&lt;100 or &lt;300) then attack other farmers for gold. The basic idea is 1) stay at a low level so you don’t get attacked by people 3 starring you 2) raid other farmers and build up using natural income.

Note: There was an attempt to create a farming community before in which members voluntarily left their resources exposed. I am fairly sure this has fallen apart but if anyone has current information post it below or PM me and I’ll edit.

Hey Clashers!!

I have been getting a lot of request from my clanmates and forum users to update my TH8 Farming Base that gained a lot of popularity a few months ago when centralized Teslas was the new trend. 

Here's an old pic: ( this was Pre-3AD )
http://i.imgur.com/jbWhkn3.jpg


That being said

I am going to show you 2 variations:

Variation 1: Original

http://i.imgur.com/GaDvZrf.jpg

This is the one that I will be using 99% of the time when i'm done with the majority of my elixir upgrades. 

The features:

- Balanced point defenses
- Storage prioritization ( 1 resource type + DE ) 
- Overlapping Wiz tower coverage for your protected storage 
- Funneling with Wiz towers covering the choke points.
-Balanced Traps

Current Issues:
2-14 walls to spare without destroying the funneling completely. I tried partitioning the center making 2 ""L's"" but that through of all the junctions. In addition

Variation 2: Customized for 8 storage protection.

http://i.imgur.com/zHyoTHd.jpg


This is the one I will be using at the early stages of TH9 as I still have a lot of elixir upgrades to do. This one is also showing my mortar location if and only if my DE is under 10k. I am currently focused on DE farming so I will have the DE storage in the middle 9 times out of 10 but I am getting ready to spend DE on AQ so I will move the storage out as there is no reason to protect what you don't have.  


What i'm looking for is TH9 users that are completed with their elixir upgrades and defenses in the 1500-2000 farming range. It's very hard to test bases when I am constantly upgrading defenses and lowbies tagging my TH  . If you plan on testing hit me up with a PM. If full - send me an email -misfitsofwar@gmail.com so we can keep in touch with your progress.

I will be continuing to adjust and adapt my base as I am still continuing to play with the design and fix the weak points. My base as it is now is a current mess with so many defensive buildings upgrading so disregard what it looks like ATM if you view my base ;p



Special shoutout to anzwarmonkey who's base inspired me to update mine with the focus on centralized/overlapping wiz towers vs the teslas ;p Big shoutout to all you base designers that have come up with me over the last 6 months - you know who you are! Respect.  

Thanks for all your support!!

Remember, Reddit X-Ray had 11 698 trophies and Reddit Kappa had 12 657. So basically a difference of more or less one thousand trophies.
The final trophy counts (wich I took at exactly 10:02 pm pacific time) Were Reddit X-Ray 15 910 and Reddit Kappa 16 886. As you can see

Reddit X-Ray: net gain of 4 212
Reddit Kappa: net gain of 4 229
17 trophies was the deciding number, however Reddit Kappa managed to trump us. 

Kudos to Reddit Kappa, wether you're doing a net gain or a total trophy competition) I tip my hat to you (:

For our first clan war (or at least first clan war since i've been leader) I believe that we did all we could, and also to have our sweet vengance with Kappa (;

Also

Keep on clashing!

    ----------

**Clan Leader Corner:**

Steam rolling right along into Season 2 of the League experiment. Bonus' just too low to really warrant the additional difficulty and infrequency of loot at higher cups... For that reason

* Clan Rules: We decided to drop the trophy requirement for membership, as well. Clan members are required to donate to all open requests before requesting troops of their own. Lastly, any new members applying to the clan should be able to donate Level 5 archers or above and also be willing to meet the above requirements.

* We will be opening up for applications to be promoted to elder this season as well. We will compile the applicants this week and announce the winners at next seasons review. Any interested member please send me a private message on Reddit and include:

* In game name
* Age
* Location
* Why you want to be an elder (what can you bring to the table)?


And now on with the epic stats!

    ----------


**Donations:**

This season the average clan member donated **1372** troops. That is down from 1402 troops last season. Our median donation count was **650**. The overall donations went down to **61703** from 72431. This is the first week in the last 10 weeks our donation count has actually decreased from the previous week. Plateau or just a bump in the road

Top 10 Donators for this week:

* KENRRM (10111) - So... when Ken maxes out elixir he goes on drag-fest and donates absurd amounts of troops! More then the next 3 members combined. No way he could top this! Great job!
* Big Andy's Army (3216) - Jumping up from the number 6 spot. Quietly putting in work. Well done!
* george (3192) - New member this season and ranks in the top 3! Thats the kind of recruit we like to see! Way to go!
* michel (3032) - Toping the charts for the elders this week. Michel proves he can be a consistant donation machine.
* Awesome-O (2884) - Newly upgraded lvl 6 troops makes this number oh so much sweeter!
* LosPharmD (2824) - My mini minions carry me on black wings to the bmber 6 spot! 
* lilmissfoodie (2789) - First member in the clan to reach level 6 archers
* Killerd (2488) - Moving up 1 spot to number 8
* c0copopps (2008) -  Last member to break the 2k mark. The swedish sensation is back!
* Pedro (1907) - He will not be denied a spot on the leader board. Squeezing into the top 10 this week


**Donation All-time High Score: KENRRM (10111) - 05/12/13**


    ----------


**Trophy Counts (Current Clan Rank 11680):**

Our Clans Overall Trophy Count this week is **14691** and our average Trophy count for our members was **1372**. The median trophy count this week was **1382** and the average change was **-27** trophies. We fell almost 3000 spots as many members settled in to farm at lower trophy counts. 

Top 5 Member Trophy Counts were:

* ggout (1677) - Tops the list this week!
* killerd (1599) - Breaks into the list for the first time in a while. 
* LosPharmD (1531) - Must be a slow week if I made it into the top 3. Woot for me! 
* Alred13 (1509) - Just into 1500 territory. 
* parsi (1503) - Another one sneaking above 1500.

Top 5 Most Improved Trophy Counts were:

* Karloz (+369) - 1070 to 1439! 
* ggout (+185) - 1492 to 1677! 
* cooperlittle (+173) - 1215 to 1388! 
* kcarr (+149) - 1237 to 1386! 
* killerd (+98) - 1501 to 1599!

**Trophy Count All-time High Score: Awesome-O (1959) - 04/08/13**

**New Member Spotlight:**

We had 8 new members over the last two weeks. Many of them are very active and doing an amazing job! Lets give them a warm welcome!

* Captain - 1497 trophies (860 donations)
* smiley*12 - 1475 trophies (513 donations)

However, 7, and 8), for a total of 16 more days. Finally, my mines and collectors were way under leveled, I am going to assume that they were all at lvl7 going into TH8 for simplicitys sake, for a total of 120 more days (10 days to take 1 pump/mine from 7 to 11 times 12 pumps/mines). Finally I had about 3 days of carry over cost from the second elixir storage. This makes for a grand total of 164 more builder days, so lets call it an even 10 days of carry over research cost.

There were several updates that also changed the build times of various buildings, dark elixir drill, gold mine, elixir pump, dark barracks again), but by and large they changed before I was able to upgrade them so they are mostly a wash.

Therefore I have a grand total of **141.75** days of construction costs in real world days (with 4 builders) and 111 days of research time. It took me **149** days to do it which is just over **95%** efficient.

TL;DR You too can achieve a totally awesome base and reach high level town halls

1369705336.0,1f68da,"Reddit Indy - Week 20 in Review (Ratios, Emoji, and Inferno Towers, Oh My!)",Lospharmd,3, a humble member of the Clash of Clans Subreddit Clan Network. This is a biweekly recap of the goings on in our clan


    ----------

**Clan Leader Corner:**

New Update this Season and look at all the awesome stuff for TH7, barracks arrows, and global chat with a bunch of pictures in it. There was one interesting thing impacting the review which was the new troops received statistic which will allow us to look at the ratios of Donated troops to Received troops. I will post the first seasons number here even though it only counts received for the second half. It might give some other leaders an insight into our numbers which could prove helpful.

* Clan Rules: The donation requirement is 150 troops donated each week and 300 per season. Two seasons within the 300-400 range will also count as inactivity

* Since we dropped the trophy requirements

And now on with the epic stats!

    ----------


**Donations:**

This season the average clan member donated **1266** troops. That is down from 1372 troops last season. Our median donation count was **783**. The overall donations went down to **60261** from 61703. Average troops received was **300** and the Average Ratio (D/R) was **7.2**.

Top 10 Donators for this week:

* KENRRM (8011) - Ken drops 2k donations from last week but still remains on top. The Ken and everyone else show continues! Good work
* c0copopps (5504) - Jumping up from the number 9 spot. Giving Ken a run for his money!
* LosPharmD (3043) - 200 more donations then last week boosts me to number 3. Tyvm!
* lilmissfoodie (2363) - Indy leadership proving we are contenders. Foodie slides into fourth.
* killerd (2266) - Second elder to make the list. Nice work!
* michel (2266) - Week after week
* george (2209) - Relativly new member really proving he is a donation phenomena!
* Big Andy's Army (1954) - Just a few shy of the 2k mark. BAA is def a donations BA.  
* Rexy (1602) -  Another new member this season
* Brad (1594) - Brad's been missed on the leader boards. Good to see him make the top 10. 


**Donation All-time High Score: KENRRM (10111) - 05/12/13**

Top 10 Ratios (D/R) for this week:

* Rexy (40.1) - 1602:40
* KENRRM (34.7) - 8011:231 
* Chris_Is_Bored (23.8) - 952:40 
* dwhsnowman (16.7) - 750:45
* kcarr (15.5) - 466:30
* Pedro (14.9) - 1491:100
* cretodecristo (14.8) - 592:40 
* :Amarant: (13.1) - 773:59 
* Sether (11.0) - 1157:105  
* RokrZep (10.8) - 1075:100

    ----------


**Trophy Counts (Current Clan Rank 14517):**

Our Clans Overall Trophy Count this week is **14541** and our average Trophy count for our members was **1266**. The median trophy count this week was **1318** and the average change was **-96** trophies. We fell almost 3000 spots as many members settled in to farm at lower trophy counts. 

Top 5 Member Trophy Counts were:

* Michael (1818) - Newest member comes in on a high!
* RokrZep (1751) - Increased almost 450 cups to reach this cup total. Nice! 
* Nickbel (1694) - Another new member coming in at number 3. 
* Parsi (1572) - Moving up to number 4 this week. 
* michel (1501) - No


**Trophy Count All-time High Score: Awesome-O (1959) - 04/08/13**

    ----------

**More Flexibility**

**Multiple Builders Per Upgrade**
A lot of times, and then being able to take extra ones off the build as I want.

**Boost Builders**
The boost could be for the whole project, 5 gems for 20 minutes, etc. Thanks to [Chief Maximos92] (http://www.reddit.com/user/maximos92) for this idea!



**Reassigning a Builder**
I want to be able to temporarily stop (as an example) upgrading a cannon to level 5. It still wouldn't be able to be used



**Queuing**
This one is simple. Be able to make a list of what you want builders to upgrade, it goes immediately to that upgrade.

1369102656.0,1eqkzp,Suggestion: decreased training times as you upgrade barracks,jewboyfresh,21,2,16,"I think it would be a good idea if the training time for troops would decrease for every level of the barracks

For example

Lvl 2 barracks: 10% reduction time for archers and barbs

Lvl 3 barracks: 10% reduction for gobs and additional 10% off the already existing time so archers would take ~20seconds to make

and so on with addition reductions so at lvl 10 archers would only take about 10 seconds to make

[Base](http://i.imgur.com/sQ4QMYL.jpg)

This base design is something I just through together with minimal thought. The first 15 attacks my lvl 6 mortar was being built. The range of Gold and Elix is due to when I made a big purchase with my resources to being an upgrade (lvl 6 Mortar, ~30 lvl 7 Walls)


**So lets start with where this was tested at:**

* Trophy Count: 1520-1805

* Trophy Average: 1730

* Elixir Amount: 200k-2m

* Gold Amount: 50k-1.8m

* Dark Elixir Amount: 3k-5.6k

* Trophies Gained: 328

* Trophies Lost: 87

* Largest Percent Lost: 56%

**Short Breakdown**

The North and South exterior walls are there solely to funnel goblins

The walls to the West and East: [click here](http://i.imgur.com/1V3IWDi.jpg)

They are 3 spaces away from the defences. This makes it so archers are forced to come in closer to the defense and allow the mortars in the middle of the base to target them. 

While my Dark Elixir was lower than 4.5k I had my Clan Castle and Dark Elixir storaged positioned: [like so](http://i.imgur.com/3yLtqOr.jpg)

Which was very effective since my clan castle units were able to reach the northside of the TH.

And finally the battle log: [Battle Log](http://imgur.com/a/chlv4)

Hopefully you all find this helpful. I will be starting my next design soon. 

See you all next week!

**What to Expect Next Week**

What this series will include:


1) Redesign of my base each week(so long as time permits between work and school)


2) Create both farming and trophy count based designs.

3) Keep the design for a whole week and keep a high trophy count(1500+)

5) Post the whole weeks battle log


Why high trophy count?

That way you know that the design will do better than at a lower trophy count.

Why TH8?

I am TH8 and this is the TH where most players will settle down and upgrade everything before going to TH9.


Disclaimer: This will only be a TH8 base design since that is what I have. I do not think I am the ""best"" or anything like that

So what do you think? Waste of my time or will you all benefit from it?

Thanks

Mike (Hotel Leader)

Just like bombs and spring traps, but freeze and lightning would really mess up some attacks. This would also open room for spells like a ""freedom"" spell or something
