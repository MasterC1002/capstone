The point I'm trying to get here is that people vote on emotion. People walk into the voting booth based on what they know, USA. 

My proposal is simple

My proposal is to link the average person to the War on Drugs. Show them how they are directly being affected by the prohibition of cannabis, dollar signs, images of crime and violence, peaceful hippies or the dreadlocked college student is not going to help the cause and the reason is because most people can't relate to that.

So, and socioeconomic status.

1. A visibly ill woman, surrounded by family, and writhing in pain. She's hooked to IV's and she is coughing and crying. The doctor and nurse in the hallway have a small dialogue to the effect of ""I've given her the maximum dosage of pain medication, but the chemotherapy is making her so nauseous that she can't keep anything down."" 

The commercial ends with a fade out to one small

2. A group of college students are partying excessively, paramedics surround the young man, trying to wake him up by pushing drugs, but he has died from alcohol intoxication.

Fade out fact: Alcohol consumption leads to 80

3. *This idea came to me after learning that a friend of my family was implicated in a sting operation. The man, cops and FBI rush their door pointing guns at their head, and fire two shots to silence the family dogs by killing them.* 

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9Com08ILgQ for reference.

Basically a simulation of this exact scenario. A small family living a quaint happy life are suddenly thrown into the midst of a drug scandal which destroys their family life

Fade out fact: Innocent people become victims of the War on Drugs. This could be your house

It's late and I've been thinking about this post for several days now...and I know it's far from perfect, donate to the christian childrens fund. These people have mastered the manipulation of human emotion and directly funnel it to get across a message. I think we can use this same tactic to promote our cause.",,False,self,t5_2tr4p,False,,

Dear TroutM4n

For the first time in five years

At the start of the Obama administration, and it can now be said that Pres. Obama is even worse than Pres. George W. Bush on this issue. Obama’s Department of Justice is relentlessly attacking state-approved medical marijuana providers.

Medical marijuana champions in Congress have decided it is time to send the president a message. The Rohrabacher-Hinchey-Farr amendment will be proposed during the debate on the FY2013 Commerce

[Please visit our action page to look up your member of Congress and use the short script we have provided to send a message encouraging a “yes” vote on this amendment.](http://control.mpp.org/site/R?i=s5L0429oyxwopjrs7OuVFw) These calls really do help.

While I have subscribed to this idea

Now, diligence, and motivation to actually do anything about it. Luckily, this 20 days of tolerance would give me exactly enough time to initiate at least some level of interest in the issue in my local community.

So here is my plan:

* Ask the [/r/trees](/r/trees)  community for brain storming help.

We could put our heads together to compile a list of reasons marijuana should be legalized. I know 420 reasons is unrealistic

* List the reasons from most convincing to least convincing.

To be fair, or a police officer. The ultimate goal is to prove that it should be legal not to shoot the cause in the foot. Therefore only the most convincing reasons will be used for the protest.

* Finally

""No man is worth his salt who is not ready at all times to risk his well-being, in a great cause.""
--Theodore Roosevelt

I don't know if writing in chalk in public areas is vandalism or not (though I highly doubt that it is) but that is not something that concerns me. What does concern me is that the government can tell us what we can and cannot put into our bodies and then has the audacity to put us in prison if we don't agree. This is why on April 19 (in the dead of night) hours before 4/20

No longer will I stay silent. I hope that you ents feel the same way too. If all goes well

For instance

&gt;What if there was a single way for police to make money off of sending people to jail. For firms to make money denying people medicine. For government officials to pocket millions of dollars just to keep quiet.  For prisons to spend billions of taxpayer dollars on housing non-violent offenders for years because they posed a threat to big business. For violent gangs to prosper and grow underground empires. For government to impede on the rights of the populous. A way to dramatically increase the deficit and ruin millions of lives.

&gt;There is. It's called prohibition.

.

.

EDIT: I just had another idea. How about a viral campaign in an 'alternate universe' where marijuana is currently LEGAL, an alternate universe) where people are being devastated by police cracking down on a widely used and appreciated substance. Old people being arrested for using marijuana to alleviate them from pain. Farmers being bullied by government agents trying to get them to stop growing their CASH crop. And lobbyists are hiring 'hitmen' to go around and ruin peoples' gardens for growing marijuana. All because big mega-corps cant make money off of something that grows freely and naturally in the ground.

There is one candidate (currently [polling at 5.3% nationally](http://garyjohnsongrassrootsblog.blogspot.com/2012/07/new-jz-analytics-poll-gary-johnson-at.html)) that is a staunch proponent for cannabis law reform. His name is Gary Johnson.

1335813529.0,t06qy,Hello /r/timetolegalize. I'm the newly appointed mod.,anticommon,119,10,14,"My name is anticommon. You guys may or may not know me as a regular poster here on r/timetolegalize (with such posts as the QR code thingymabob)

About a week or so ago, and not because I want to profit from the wonderful movement we're trying to build here. I just want to be and do the most that I can.

Unfortunately - I'm in my own sort of pickle. I've got finals for school now through the 4th, when I get back, I've got a few months off from school and can really kick things into full gear. Which I plan on doing.

Now, and tying off my own loose ends. Since I've come back, I've noticed that there has been a sort of uproar about the mods in this community, and certain other members of this community. The fact that people have quit/left and that things have somewhat slowed down has been sinking in as I read more and more about it, and I'm pretty sure I understand the dilemma of there being no formal plan constructed *and* enforced by the mods (including me). 

*So what do* ***I*** *plan to do?* I plan on listening to this community, giving ideas that the community largely supports the recognition that they deserve, implementing and enforcing the best plan and call to action that we (as a community) can devise, and to be a fair, just, and trustworthy moderator. I am transparent and more than willing to prove myself to this community. 

But alas - I am in a pickle. Chances are, if I should fail then by all means I do not deserve to be a moderator helping to guide this community towards the legalization of Marijuana. 

Now, contacts, ideas, organizations, politicians, etc. - your posts aren't being wasted and thrown out. Material is being collected, and I suppose we've just got to find out what to do with it all. (the other mod's might have a better idea when it comes to that - I've only been exposed to the documents for a short while) Also, personally I'd like to see us spice up the subreddit a little bit

**INTRODUCTION**

The introduction will have an interview with [KingNick](http://www.reddit.com/r/trees/comments/r3i7k/lets_do_something_about_this/c42no3x). Nick will tell his story (at least a portion of it) without addressing the term cannabis (or it's synonyms). 

He will explain his plight in losing access to the one medication that worked. Then a reveal will be made

Currently we are working with someone in Florida who has volunteered to help us film. More updates to come on that front later.

**ENDING SUGGESTIONS**

At the end of the video

* **Share the video.** The more people that can see what is going on
* **Vote.** Available on the website will be a list of all the current state measures. We will show what each measure will do so that viewers can make an informed decision.
* **Contact representatives.** If the representatives are all contacted about this video
* **Make a personal video.** Viewers will also be encouraged to make a personal video detailing how prohibition has affected them. This video won't be nearly long enough for all the stories I'm hearing

These things are only specifics though. There are other things we plan on having in the video

**Mission statement:** 50% of the US population wants to legalize the use of cannabis. Using video and social media we aim to inform the other 50%

**Vision statement:** End Prohibition.

**Next steps:**

* Find a solid [theme and format](http://www.reddit.com/r/timetolegalize/comments/r3tji/editing_central_theme_and_format/). One that will bring the entire video together: colors, etc.
* Get an [outline](http://www.reddit.com/r/timetolegalize/comments/r3u6h/editing_the_outline/) together that shows every part of the video.
* Write a script.
* Record voice-over
* Set aside different sections for different [video editors](http://www.reddit.com/r/timetolegalize/comments/r3nt9/video_editors_report_here/) to splice together using the original theme/format.
* Cut these together and send to someone to [score](http://www.reddit.com/r/timetolegalize/comments/r3qog/editing_musicscore/).
* Finally

**Date of publishing:** State elections happen in November. If we publish

**Goals:**

* Share the video everywhere. Share on twitter
* Have each US representative contacted by viewers.
* Make a personal video about how prohibition affects you.

**Guiding principles:**

* We will not advocate the current illegal use of any prohibited substance.
* Presidential candidates are not to be endorsed or opposed.
* Fundraising is not for us. This is 100% volunteer driven.
* Limit the use of the color green.
* We will not be represented by the stereotypes of ""dirty hippies"" (dreads
* Cannabis-leaves cannot be present in the video.
* Any music that evokes feelings of rebellion (rock, etc.) will not be used.
* Celebrities categorized with “stoners” cannot be shown.
* Smoke or references to smoke will not be made.

(Some of these are difficult

**What can I do in the meantime?**

* Continue posting relevant videos to the subreddit
* Discuss all aspects of the project in relevant posts (linked in the sidebar)
* Specifically

**Most important**:

* Always remember who the target audience tends to be. Hint: they aren't tree-loving liberals.

1333813974.0,rxy3w,Medical Marijuana - My concerns,Botarz,98,9,26,"As the medical marijuana movement moves across the US

When the talk of medical marijuana first started, ""yeah, right."" That is the very first problem this movement has to overcome. Although the misinformation on the prohibition side is evident to anyone willing to research the topic in the slightest, the uninformed masses still believe what they learned in DARE classes or heard on the news. I personally found it interesting when the false stories of marijuana causing men's breasts to enlarge and their testicles to shrink hit the news. If we can't scare them away with false medical concerns, let's go after their sexuality. Priceless, humorous, and unfortunately effective in many cases. Sheople aren't led by the nose like common farm animals... however

With the ever increasing number of medical conditions that are aided by medical marijuana, as we've heard stories about in California, will just prescribe medical marijuana for any condition. Cancer... prescription. AIDS... prescription. Anxiety... prescription. Depression... prescription. Sleeplessness... prescription. Rash... prescription. Hangnail... prescription. Perception is truth. If it is perceived that it is all a ruse, we're done. If medical marijuana is passed, then those who get it passed and benefit from it's use had damn well better police their own. If not, the backlash will be severe and we can forget about ever seeing it changed again in our lifetime.

Instead of incrementalization and the perception of being deceptive to gain what we ultimately want... you know... politics as usual... why don't we take the high road (pun intended) and actually go for what we seek. Outright legalization. Seriously. What is the problem? 

From the justice departments website, and a lack of accepted safety for use of the drug or other substance under medical supervision."" This statement, and the resulting classification of marijuana, is an outright lie. Fourteen states have approved MEDICAL marijuana... the substance the US government is claiming has NO currently accepted medical use. Anyone who is capable of reading, and has done so at all, KNOWS it has medical benefits. The argument, if any, as are caffeine

So... what is the problem? You have a naturally occuring plant that has a vast number of industrial uses from paper, but yet the sheople do not demand a change. Seems ""feeling good"" is bad.

Can that be possible? Feeling good is bad? I don't know... you tell me. What do we think of someone who goes out drinking, but we don't want them enjoying themselves. Sex? BAD! Sex is only for married folk and only to propogate the species... yeah, right. These taboos have so much influence over our lives that if we have a presidential candidate that admits to smoking pot, he has to minimalize it by lying... ""I didn't inhale."" Yeah right, next you'll tell us you didn't have sex with that woman. Because we all know sex is bad... abstinence first, right?

Please excuse my language for a moment... I really wanted to write a piece without foul language... GROW THE FUCK UP! The people who tell you drinking is bad... sex is bad... guns are bad... they are the ones getting drunk, if they could get away with it. Newsflash sheople... feeling good is not bad. The peasantry is allowed to feel good just like the ruling class. Is it sinking in yet? YOU ARE BEING CONTROLLED.

It is time to take a stand and stop the bullshit. Join NORML. If you don't want your name on any list for fear of repercussions

However

The green/leaf driven logos CAN be used

* Contact your rep (info on how to contact your rep)
* Voting (a list of current measures)
* **Spread the word** (a page filled with official logos

The Spread the Word page will have logos, twitter hashtags, posters, and more that viewers can use to spread the word. This is where we can use more green and leaves.

But we cannot use it in the majority of the video. The leaves will not be shown and green must be limited in use. A logo (with green) in the video would be ok as long as it is subtle.

My name is Tom Angell

http://www.MarijuanaMajority.com

For the past 12 years

When I began work on this issue as a college student 12 years ago, and members of the media scarcely discussed it. Even good friends of mine would be reluctant to talk about the issue, for fear of being marginalized and laughed at as some kind of ""stoner.""

Today, a **majority of Americans** said that they support legalizing marijuana -- the first time this has ever happened. And two weeks from now three states -- Colorado, Oregon and Washington -- have initiatives on the ballot to regulate and tax marijuana. Polls show we have an excellent chance of winning in at least one of these states, **making history by legalizing marijuana** for the first time ever.

I believe we're approaching a **tipping point**

This is the reason we created Marijuana Majority. On http://www.MarijuanaMajority.com, celebrities, medical professionals, business leaders and members of law enforcement who think it’s time to end the war on marijuana.

More than just merely tracking the large number of prominent people and organizations that are already a part of the Marijuana Majority

By making the content easily sharable on Facebook and Twitter, and even *Morgan Freeman* is speaking out!”

We’ve also built the site in a way that makes it more likely that even more influential celebrities and opinion leaders will add their voices to the marijuana debate. Whenever you visit the site

These are just a few of the ways that Marijuana Majority intends to influence the emerging debate about our failed marijuana laws and how to fix them.

Please take some time to read quotes and watch videos. But don’t stop there. Make sure to share the content with your social networks and tweet to some celebrities. And if you can afford it

With your help

Feel free to use it in your letter campaigns.,HillZone,79,15,16,"The full letter was too long to post here (15

Let’s review the facts:

1.    Cannabis contains many cannabinoids; THC is only one of these. THC is already FDA approved as a schedule III medication. Ironically the only cannabinoid people fear is this legal one. The other cannabinoids have medical benefits far beyond the scope of mere THC

2.    The FDA cannot regulate cannabis. It does not review unpatentable plants

3.    Smoking is not required. Vaporization, however, does not cause lung cancer. And as shown by UCLA’s Dr. Donald Tashkin in 2006, it may actually offer a slight protective effect against lung cancer compared to non-smokers.

4.    The body produces endocannabinoids

5.    The word “marijuana” was a Mexican slang word adopted to make cannabis and hemp sound foreign. Marijuana was first outlawed on the Mexican border and in the South. Even though racism is unacceptable today

6.    Cannabis is objectively, and most pharmaceutical drugs. In 1988, the DEA’s administrative law judge Francis Young called cannabis “the safest therapeutically active substance known to man.” However, we know the DEA ignores all contrary evidence. With a clear financial incentive to maintain the status quo, the DEA continues to claim cannabis isn't medicine because there isn’t enough science, while simultaneously restricting research to the NIDA supply. Police are not doctors or scientists, and should not be making medical decisions.

7.    Alcohol prohibition was a failure, and with yearly budget deficits, this change cannot come soon enough. Harvard economist Jeffrey Miron estimates that marijuana legalization is worth $85.6 billion per year in savings and new tax revenue.

8.    Legalizing marijuana does not increase use according to the data in MMJ states and in other countries where it is legal for recreational purposes. This is because a legal market gets rid of the forbidden-fruit effect. MMJ states have also seen decreases, as reported by the Wall Street Journal, as well as a lower suicide rate.

9.    Medical cannabis improves quality of life for terminally ill and seriously ill patients for which conventional medicines offer little or mediocre relief. Cannabinoids kill cancer cells


In Illinois

Perhaps one day you, and nobody wants to imagine the government making life even harder when on the brink of death. Just ask L.A. City Councilman Bill Rosendahl. After a cancer diagnosis he began using medical cannabis. He recently said “life is now worth living” thanks to his medical cannabis regimen.

Our laws should be based on science, the Compassionate Use of Medical Cannabis Pilot Program Act.

Thank you

We've got a pretty good aggregation of materials here on timetolegalize

Here are some people and groups that could use some facts:

* **Both US presidential candidates** ([@MittRomney](https://twitter.com/MittRomney/) and [@BarackObama](https://twitter.com/BarackObama/))
* **The White House** [[@whitehouse](https://twitter.com/whitehouse/)]
* **The ""No on 64"" campaign** [[@VoteNoOn64](https://twitter.com/VoteNoOn64)] (""We are coalition [sic] working together to defeat the legalization of marijuana in Colorado"")
* **Laura Chapin** [[@LauraChapin](https://twitter.com/laurachapin)] (spokesperson for the ""No on 64"" campaign. Fun fact: her twitter avatar is a woman smoking a cigarette)
* **Office of National Drug Control Policy** [[@ONDCP](https://twitter.com/ONDCP)] (""ONDCP advises the President on drug-control issues
* **National Institute on Drug Abuse** [[@NIDAnews](https://twitter.com/NIDAnews)] (This government group has severely politicized the cannabis research process)
* **NJ Governor Chris Christie** [[@GovChristie](https://twitter.com/GovChristie)] (vetoed marijuana decriminalization legislation)
* **Conservative Party of New York** [[@cpnys](https://twitter.com/cpnys))] (responsible for derailing the cannabis decriminalization bill in the New York house that Andrew Cuomo wanted)

To clarify, nothing more. We are not trying to force ideals down your throat, but there are limitations to what is possible. do not take ""we cant do that"" to mean, ""your idea was terrible and you are an awful person"", it just means that your idea is just not gonna be able to be used, and we are sorry.

I admit that we have not been finding this easy

This is where you come in. 

We need to find:

1. A person with camera equipment willing to film

2. Someone with video editing skills

3. Website designers

4. Graphics designers for flyers and logos etc.

The following things I will be giving deadlines for the community to design and submit

1. Storyboards

2. Flyers

3. QR codes

4. any sort of inventive advertsising you can think of

Another thing we will find ourselves needing is funding. Now most of this will have to come from donations

**All of the above is ideas**

Also

Whilst we cant make you a mod because you had a good idea, along with a link to their input. The designs/ideas that we will use for the final products will be put in bold, and if you wish, we can put either your username or real name in the credits of the film and or on the website.

I am 100% behind full legalization of the plant and its many uses but I want to us to be careful to not allow the discussion to be derailed because some pundit found an easy target to pounce on.

I would rather focus the discussion around the positive aspects of cannabis and readily admit that if legalized

This is my first attempt. I will consider it a success if I get 10 reports in this thread.

With that in mind **please respond to this post with your results

**How to find your governor's office**
The easiest way to do this is to go to your favorite search engine and type your state's name and ""governor"" or ""governor's office"". Contact information should be readily available.

**Call or email?** 
Calling is more effective

* First

* Second

* THIRD, but it's worth a try. Of course that will be much more likely to happen with your state representatives, rather than the governors.

**What to do on the phone/email**
Make it personal. Tell the office that you have a personal stake in cannabis legalization

Here are talking points. /r/timetolegalize has some of the best minds in the legalization movement

* Cannabis has medical applications, or even caffeine. 

* Legalization would lead to a new cottage industry that would help your state in this fragile economy.

* Incarceration rates in this country are second only to the worst times in the Soviet Union. Save money and lives by legalizing today.

**CURRENT LEGISLATION**

Keep in mind that your state may have a bill circulating. If so

How Drugs Have Effected My Life
Anonymous


	I have been told, so most of this essay is going to be filler. 
	Drugs, a little bit of a worry-wart streak, and a lot of insomnia.  Now, I have none of those three.  I blame drugs. 
	Let's start with my insomnia.  It used to be that I simply could not get more than five hours of sleep in a night.  This led to me doing poorly in school, I once took an entire bottle of over the counter sleeping pills.  How I did not die, I do not know, but thank god I wasn't smoking marijuana.  They did give me one pill that actually worked, but I was told I could not take it for longer than a two week period because it would 'destroy my liver'.  It was just supposed to get me back into a regular sleep cycle, never mind the fact that I hadn't had one of those for about three years. 
	My insomnia would later play a key role in getting me kicked out of high school and made my subsequent trip to Wilderness a hellish nightmare.  Now, because that's not true.  If it were though, wouldn't you feel terrible lighting up that sweet sensamilliah?
	Every person I meet says, you don't have insomnia.  You don't know what it's like to go three days without sleeping a wink, to lay in bed for hours and hours on end every night, your mind racing and your body unable to relax.  I sometimes hear people saying jokingly, “Oh my god I'm so OCD haha!” and I imagine that people who actually have OCD must want to reach down your throat and pull your spine out of your mouth by the scapula just like I do. 
	Back to drugs. 
	Next, that was all on me and I could not expect help.  At first I thought this was because everyone was lazy, but I later realized that it simply didn't matter that much to them.  If you're high you can be sitting in a room with your friends, watch The Mighty Boosh and eat popcorn, and have just as much fun as you would at any party.  When you're high you can be content, happy, and let your anxieties and insecurities just melt away from you for just a bit. . .   briefly grasping the serenity so many people spend their lives working to achieve. 
	Sickening. 
	When I let that dank, my eyes could linger on one thing for longer than two seconds without immediately shifting over to the nearest stimulus to acknowledge and examine it.  It was disgusting, and horrible, and awful.  Oh but the addiction.  Every pot smoker knows the symptoms of withdrawal, the shakes, the vomiting, the blood dripping from your eyes ears and nose like you were a holy statue with a rusty water pipe above it. . .  it's hell rolled in a zig-zag cone is what it is. 
	Lastly, that just disappears with pot.  Stoners are not exactly the most judgmental people, and a high person is going to have an awfully hard time focusing on what others think of them when there's a bag of cheetos on the floor and Howard Moon's gotten himself into some kind of crazy conundrum.  Oh Howard, will you ever get it right?
	Once I had a cat, just relaxing, with me stroking its fur and it purring contentedly.  Whenever I'd smoke it would rest it's head on my knee and look up at me until I blew smoke into its face, then it would curl up on my chest an fall asleep.  What a worthless junkie. 
	There is, “I don't have a drug problem, I have a police problem. ” such a statement could not be more relevant to today's society.  Consider this; currently there are more African-Americans in the American Prison System than there ever were slaves at one time (http://www. huffingtonpost. com/2011/10/12/michelle-alexander-more-black-men-in-prison-slaves-1850_n_1007368. html), the U. S.  will this year alone has already spent over thirty-seven billion dollars enforcing the drug war and with no noticable effect on the availability of drugs (http://www. drugsense. org/cms/wodclock), and as if that weren't enough this year alone over a million and a half people have already been arrested for violating drug laws (not violent behavior) (http://www. drugsense. org/cms/wodclock). 
	With such ridiculously high costs in terms of both dollars and people, have voted to legalize posession and sale of recreational marijuana.  To everyone's surprise the two states somehow still exist, and there have not been any violent murders over munchies to date. 
	Once, and left.  In the parking lot though, there was a dirty pot needle.  He fell on it and got cancer, now he's dead. 
	Do you hate black people? Well boy howdy do I have good news for you.  I mentioned earlier that the drug war has put a significant portion of the African-American population into prison
	Now in all fairness to Hampshire College
	Sometimes dogs have four legs
	So. . .  what else. . .  I guess hallucinogens have given me some bad times.  I had to go to the hospital once, you frothing collection of anal particles, you creamy stream of pus and semen, you disgust me you drug-addled lunatic! 
	Other than that though
	Well, so there's that. . .  oh, now I can't go to some parts of Mexico. . .  but wait, these are all effects of drugs being legal, so how have drugs actually negatively effected my life?
	Oh wait, stolen from, or even really yelled at anyone this entire school year.  I'm doing pretty well in my classes and I have quite a few friends, I'm moving down to the mods soon (which should be fun) and hopefully I'll get a dog.  In fact, besides the fact that I got in trouble for using them I can't really think of a way that drugs have negatively effected my life at all. 
	So what am I to write about for another two pages? Here's a poem. 
Hibbledy-bibbledy-bop 
the young boy was caught with some pot
he had a good run
the cop pulled his gun and he shot
Hibbledy-bibbledy-boo
he had a mother and a daughter too
they both were quite sad
but it was something the cop had to do
because the drug war is totally worth it
all the lives and the innocent persons
the millions of taxpayer dollars
and the lack of freedom
perhaps a lesson in history 
would make this topic less of a mystery
we tried this before
prohibition was no victory
see
only comes when in the hands of thugs
keeping it illegal is what's killing people
but onward we steadily lug

	Once there was a lumberjack.  As he was walking through the forest he came upon a deer with a broken leg. 
“Help me!” Said the deer. 
“Mmm. ” Said the lumberjack
	He scooped up the deer in his plaid-clad arms and carried it to his house
“For helping me, however, wish for more wishes. ”
“I wish the rules were different so I could wish for more wishes
“Oh
	Wasn't that a nice story? I remember my mother used to tell me stories sometimes. She'd sit on the edge of my bed and read me redwall, she wouldn't do that, and we wouldn't laugh, and I'd still go to sleep five hours later. And one time, she did do that, but I fell asleep before she was finished! Can you imagine?
	Oh, whichever word is appropriate I suppose. Suppose sure is an odd word, can you repose? Can you unpose? I suppose we'll never know, if you excuse the pun! 
	Do you know why election rhymes with erection? At the end of the day
	Some people think the alphabet goes
	Some street names for marijuana are; weed, potweed, weedpot, mary-pot, mary-weed, dank, sensamilliah, green, nugs,

I feel like the principles behind legalization carry over to so many problem areas where government and businesses are intruding and over-reaching at every corner. You ought to be able to own your own person, when others can make it their business

It's entirely inappropriate for police to even be concerned with what I'm doing in my own home, that's fine. i.e. people that operate heavy machinery or firearms obviously can't be drunk or high, duh. But what they do in their private time is theirs, and businesses act too much like they fully own people. And they're working *with* the government to *literally* own people, in some cases, when people are arrested and sent to privately owned prisons to do cheap labor there.

Just being able to get high without being hassled is all I started out wanting. But now I'm thinking entire popular outlooks on how our society interacts with itself have to change. It sounds simplistic but people really need to stop taking things so seriously and stop trying to control everything in their lives. Of course *some things* are very serious. And some things do need to be dealt with. But not *everything*. Some things can just be left alone, and abortions and gay marriage and religion; all of it. Just leave other people to do their own thing with their own minds and bodies and mind your own business. ",,False,self,t5_2tr4p,False,,

If you have too many ideas the audience won't know what to take away from it. I'd suggest going the medical route and focus on people who have truly awful diseases like [fibromyalgia](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0001463/) and how the only way they can lead bearable lives is through taking cannabis medically. Combine that with the guilt and fear they have about taking an illegal drug

While this is an important first step, then here are some action items and how to push for them.

1) Write the Department of Public Health and ask that more conditions be added to the list of Medical Conditions covered by the program.

According to Section 45 of the Illinois Act:

&gt;Section 45. Addition of debilitating medical conditions.
Any citizen may petition the Department of Public Health to add
debilitating conditions or treatments to the list of
debilitating medical conditions listed in subsection (h) of
Section 10. The Department of Public Health shall consider
petitions in the manner required by Department rule
public notice and hearing. The Department shall approve or deny
a petition within 180 days of its submission
approval
accordance with the Administrative Procedure Act. The approval
or denial of any petition is a final decision of the
Department
are vested in the Circuit Court. 

You can contact the Department of Public Health Administrative Division at the address at the bottom of [this page](
http://www.idph.state.il.us/rulesregs/rules-indexhome.htm).

2) Encourage your local government to make Cannabis Enforcement the [lowest possible priority for law enforcement] (http://www.mpp.org/reports/lowest-law-enforcement.html). A good argument now is that the state has recognized Cannabis as medicine and the unlicensed use of medicine should not be a priority for law enforcement.   

I will try to keep this post updated. If anyone else has ideas leave them in the comments and I will try to add them.

Take a look at http://blogs.seattletimes.com/politicsnorthwest/2012/11/07/u-s-justice-department-federal-marijuana-law-unchanged-by-legalization/

The comments only reiterate what we already know; that Marijuana is still a controlled substance. The good part, from the Department of Justice rather than the CO and WA U.S. Attorneys who are normally pretty autonomous. This is what allowed Melinda Haag to go after MMJ so heavily in North California.

We have also heard from the DEA. http://reason.com/blog/2012/11/07/dea-responds-to-legal-weed-in-colorado-a

The DEA is under the Department of Justice, as well as a new administrator for the DEA. This is why the feds are being so vague, the onus is currently on Obama to choose how to proceed, and the decision is either not made or not public.

1333907919.0,rzgqo,What are the best types of activism to include in a legalization video/campaign?,EVG1,34,2,6,"A legalization campaign/video should include several major opportunities for individual action that the viewers can pursue. These actions should not simply focus on spreading awareness (most people are already aware and decided)


1) **Targeted election season demonstrations**. Democratic Party leaders understand the advantages of legalization but intentionally turn their backs on a majority of their supporters

We should show up to Obama events (and Democratic leadership events) and face backwards during the speeches, the demonstration should be a broadly pre-advertised scheme aimed at eliciting participation from many audience members who *didn't* come specifically for the protest. We could popularize some signals and calls that are attached to this type of demonstration, and hope that non-activists at the events show solidarity with our cause. Something like, ""please take a moment to join us if you would also like a real answer to this issue"" or (yelled) ""can legalization supporters in the audience please join us in turning your back until the speaker explains why pot should not be regulated like alcohol"". Imagine Obama speaking around the country to crowds partially-filled with backward-facing people until he addresses our demands. This could be very possible at young venues such at colleges. The media coverage would be embarrassing and hard to ignore, but more importantly Obama would probably have to make some statements about legalization at each event to appease the skeptical crowds. This movement is possible because SO MANY people at Democratic party rallies are sidelined supporters of legalization.

2) **Economic support/opposition**. These measures should be more creative than simple boycotts of large multinationals

Negative publicity is enough to deter most companies from attacking our cause. Beer companies are particularly vulnerable because they cater to the demographic that supports legalization. Some of these companies donate to prohibition anyway. We should publicly out a limited selection of companies (maybe 5) that are the most powerful opponents of legalization and campaign to label them as ""public enemies"". Our public enemy campaign should repeat a clear narrative about each company and call on consumers to go beyond boycotting to fight the presence of these companies in their local neighborhoods. Americans hate corporate plutocracy interfering with our communities and this message should resonate with many who abhor the recent Citizens United ruling. Focusing attacks on a few companies will send a big message to other companies considering opposing us.

3) **Flood the courts**. We should encourage arrested users with court dates during a certain time frame to reject settlements and fight their marijuana charges. So many of these people have legitimate cases (based on searches, purses and backpacks"". Alone, each is too afraid to reject a plea deal. With a support network, many may decide to fight. As a start, we could find lawyers willing to represent groups of people who reject their charges.

4) **Prisoners' hunger strike**. We should find a few potentially high-profile ""unlucky marijuana user"" prisoners and encourage these inmates to begin concurrent hunger strikes in solidarity with our cause. This would become a media story and create immense pressure on federal officials as they scramble to rationalize the resources needed for these prisoners. Prisoners could end their hunger strikes after a set period or after we have accomplished certain goals. These are our compatriots but they have almost no hope

5) **Foreign influence**. Recent news has pointed to increased support for reform from people and leaders in Latin America. Our lobbying may have special influence in these countries. These people cannot ignore how much they suffer from prohibition. Our campaign should send a clear signal to Mexicans, and Latin America should stop destroying itself to support our crumbling policy."" We may have outsized impact through this method simply because of the novelty of the idea. Are their any potential actions for utilizing this opportunity?


**Note**: Condensing all activism efforts into one set time-frame magnifies their impact by synchronizing events and activating sidelined supporters with a feeling of an imminent success. I think the time-frame of our entire campaign should be no longer than 1 year and have specific start/end dates. Preempting the election is obviously a smart idea. I would propose a time-frame of 5/1/12 to 11/6/12 (election day).
