I have compiled this list from reddit posts, but let's make it better for everyone's sake. These are sorted in no particular order.

I have also started adding in disc associations where you can possibly find other teams that have no tryouts or to find summer leagues to play in in addition to a club team. If you know of any others

Currently **98** teams listed.

You don't have to be ""That Guy"" to be a great ultimate player.

What I mean by this is that there are many players on a team who are the heart and soul of their team, big plays and I then remind them, as I am reminding you, an NFL QB without a good supporting cast, still sucks.  Here are some examples of the types of players I mean (chances are good that, if you are a good player who thinks they need to get better at something, you are one of these types

""Possession Handlers"" - you guys are the bread and butter of a team.  Often found in an ""Apex"", are not selfish, do not look for glory, and rarely do anything risky.  The catch and throw the swings, make easy upfield passes, are always there for the dump, directing traffic.  These players are always playing within their game, their team will rely on them to do what's best for the team.  These are the type of people who need to be involved in politics

""Shut down defenders"" - These are players who are seemingly forgotten, but never getting broken, these defenders make championship caliber teams.  

""First cutters"" - In many offenses, players must work in pairs (or, surprise, as a team) to create holes and make open spaces happen.  The ""First Cutter"" is the type of player who make sure they move the defenders out of the way, creating lanes for the other cutters on the team.  The most frustrated player on the field, the First Cutter never sees their handy-work pay off, as they are never thrown the disc, Lana (a skill that cannot be taught, these players are the motor of the offense

While coaching full time I have accumulated a massive collection of strength and conditioning text books and research articles.  I have condensed 68 of these references into the categories Strength
). We are officially releasing it today 5-14-13 and I couldn't be more excited!

Anyone who knows me knows that I thrive on positive relationships and seeing people grow and reach their goals.  It is my hope that my friends and members of our growing community will take time
to learn the EU curriculum and read the Foundation. This will allow us all to grow together as a community

I am thankful for this opportunity and looking forward sharing any insights I can!  

OH! and you can call me Timbo! :)

Ask me anything about my experiences thus far in the AUDL, or about anything ultimate-related. Obviously, anything I say here are my thoughts only, and not necessarily representative of the thoughts of the Breeze or AUDL.

EDIT (again): Here's an email I got from Five.

&gt;We would love to do an order for Reddit as long as you guys order above our minimum of 15! It would be processed as if you were a team: you'd fill out an order form where you could specify size and we'd send you a quote and mock-ups to approve. Similarly, would be adding a shipping charge for each address you wanted to ship to. If all the all the shipping addresses are domestic we could likely charge a flat rate for all shipments. However, international orders cost a lot more to ship and would complicate things a bit.The shorts as they stand now would require about 6 screens, making them about 34$ + $4 for shipping. We could try to get the crest down to 2 or three colors and that would save a bit of money. Do you happen to have a vector file of the Reddit crest?

cheers
Kip and the Five Crew

So there it is. From what I read, watch the ""New"" tab and post your design. The full rules will be listed in the text of that post. 

Also, could they help me move that particular aspect along?

I'm a firm believer that it's hard to understand ultimate at a competitive level until one experiences real tournament play, which is a great opportunity to get new players involved since it is an easy tournament for us. We want to build a better future but the team, but we also always have a lot of new seniors who quit lacrosse or soccer to play ultimate.    

We play only two USA Ultimate-sanctioned events in the spring, which is fairly steep for anyone trying to figure out if they want to play seriously.   
I think that the cost of youth memberships greatly limits interest in the sport. I miss the UPA days when memberships were much

High school is a great place to start playing, there are many ways to do this—intramurals, clubs, etc.—but in high school, schools are lucky to even have any team at all. The team is the ""casual"" level of play in high school, and asking high schoolers to fork out $30 for something they view as a new hobby just to compete is turning people away from the sport.     

Possible solutions
-Bring back the pay-per-tournament option  
-Have memberships run from Aug 1 to July 31—this way
-Stop fucking charging us so much.  

Basically, but that I feel as if the team has a bleak future because we can't get new players interested. Let me know what you guys think.",,False,,t5_2qnym,False,,

Lately


A true sports highlight has a lot of action or has a great play.  For example


In my opinion

- A huge sky on O or on D

- A great lay out on O or on D

- A great mark

- Breaking the mark effortlessly

Bad highlights include (but are not limited to):

- A catch in the end zone by a player who is uncovered

- A misthrown pass that is D'ed

- A predictable huck

- Any player catching a routine pass  


A good highlight can also be ruined by poor camera work.  Any highlight worth including in your reel should be unobstructed and fully in frame.  A great layout D that is unclear because your grandpa forgot he was holding a camera makes for a bad highlight.  Make sure we know what's going on and we can get a feel for the play.

Here are some examples of good highlight reels (by no means is this list exhaustive):

[Nick Lance Callahan](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7tkegQmLII)

[Best of women's ultimate](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fguRqolq9-I)

[Greatest highlight reel ever](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uq3pg0JcJSI)

[2007 UPA highlights Remix](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wDvuBTj8Vk)

These highlight reels are all 3 - 5 minutes in length.  It is tempting to include all of your teammates in your team's highlight reel

With these tips in mind

Thanks

&gt;Dear Connecticut Constitution family

&gt;It is with great sadness that we are forced to announce the indefinite suspension of all team operations as of 2:00pm EST this afternoon. This decision comes at an inopportune time as we journey through the inaugural season. This has been a journey dotted with success after success for our team and our franchise. The Connecticut team is one of the premiere franchises in the league both in victories and in fan attendance. The AUDL has sued the Constitution and the Rhode island Rampage and that suit has caused us to spend an enormous amount of money protecting our rights

&gt;During May 2012, we challenged the League to answer why we were not approached about these sales prior to the League selling these territories inasmuch as both of these new teams existed within our owned territories. The territory ownership area is governed by a Territory License Agreement (TLA) that was created, signed and approved by the League. This territory agreement allows us to own an area that includes a 100 mile radius. New York City and Boston are within our territories.

&gt;We sought answers to our concerns numerous times and felt that the TLA was clear and that no other team could exist in our area. After numerous attempts to get clarification from the League, they elected to file a suit against us. This lawsuit was filed from Michigan, and includes a number of allegations within their suit. They allege that the contract they wrote doesn’t mean what it says, among other items.

&gt;We have been forced to retain attorneys in both Connecticut and Michigan to answer their allegations

&gt;The League, a territory that we have cultivated all season. The League continues to be silent about the Boston territory.

&gt;Our organization cannot absorb the cost of these attorney fees and continue operational costs. In addition

&gt;Therefore

&gt;Regrettably

1366138734.0,1ch8fy,Survey: Most common injuries in Ultimate,jestopher,55,7,50,"Hey /r/Ultimate


I found a brief paper from 2006 that was wasn't very detailed. It listed muscle strains/pulls, and shoulder injuries as the four most common. The study only polled 135 people and didn't gather detailed data about specificity of the injuries. For example, ""knee injuries"" are all lumped together without specifying whether it was a mild LCL sprain or a full ACL tear. 


So, because I'm bad at time management), I threw together my own survey. If you've got 5-10 minutes, fill it out. I've got it set up so that after you complete it you can see the results.


No personal information (beyond age and sex) will be recorded. I'll post the full results when I close the survey.


**Survey link**: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1kqFsO939SE3CDMaZ3OkhpxKIiGR5WAKnyXVewUzP33Y/viewform


**EDIT 1**: For those of you who haven't yet taken it:

1. I forgot about hip injuries. Please list those in the last text box.

2. Please only include injuries directly related to Ultimate. This does *not* include injuries due to lifting, game, or tournament. 

**EDIT 2**: Preliminary results. Top four injuries as results come in.

20 respondents: muscle strain/pull 70%, arm/hand 35%

40 respondents: muscle strain/pull 68%, arm/hand 40%

260 respondents: muscle strain/pull 65%, shoulder 30%

321 respondents: muscle strain/pull 66%, arm/hand &amp; leg/feet tied at 37%

360 respondents: muscle strain/pull 67%, leg/feet 38%

375 respondents: muscle strain/pull 67%, arm/hand &amp; leg/feet tied at 38%

511 respondents: muscle strain/pull 66%, leg/feet 38%

525 respondents: muscle strain/pull 66%, leg/feet 39%

540 respondents (4x original study!): muscle strain/pull 67%, leg/feet 39%

575 respondents: muscle strain/pull 67%, leg/feet 39%

**Edit 3**: For those of you listing your injuries in this thread: Your answers will not count towards the final numbers unless you also take the survey.

I think it would be sweet if RedditGifts facilitated an Ultimate-related exchange. Posts about trading Ultimate items crop up in this subreddit all the time. Some ideas: discs/frisbees, hats, posters, DVDs, Ulticards, spikeball nets, etc. And the Ultimate community is large enough that an exchange would hopefully yield a lot of participants. (Maybe we could also expand the exchange to ""everything disc"" so disc golf players and frisbee enthusiasts could participate too?)

I've compiled a few points from the 11th edition USAU rules that I've seen players screw up.  I'll provide my interpretation of the rules, we will assume USAU.

How did I choose these points?  They're mostly stuff I have seen players screw up.  A few of them are points from the rules that I thought were abstruse or not well known.  One or two are things *I* didn't know before I went carefully through the rules.

I'll post the first one today, as well.

Commentators that aren't abysmal will help in this regard, and the experience of watching the game with commentary vs. without commentary is largely the same, especially if you understand the ref's hand signals.

Five's screen printing (sublimation is not yet done on shorts :[) website is linked [here](http://fiveultimate.com/team/customization/). This will allow you to get an estimate on cost and any design restrictions. 

RULES:
Designs must be posted here, the estimated cost, and if you play for a team, list that for us!

The design with the most upvotes will win. If the design needs to be altered (copyright issues, that will be done with the artist of the winning design. 

Designs must include at least one of the following: Reddit crest,"" the laying out alien, or upvote/downvote arrows. AT LEAST ONE MUST BE INCLUDED.

Designs must include a spot for custom numbers. While this may or may not be possible

**THIS CONTEST WILL END ON WEDNESDAY

EDIT: Thank you all for your wonderful submissions. As of right now

I'm going to find some other options for printing (Spin, BreakMark, etc.).

Once I have a pretty good idea on limitations, but perhaps through an external site. 

Once a design has been picked

The artist and I will make any changes necessary

The printing company will begin to take orders

Thanks you guys SO MUCH for all of the support this has garnered. I feel like this is a great way to express how we feel about reddit and ultimate. Stay tuned for updates

I've been promising for a while now

We have several goals with these guidelines. We want to:

* Give people an idea of what to expect from this forum and its moderators
* Prevent our subreddit from devolving into non-ultimate related or very loosely related to ultimate nonsense
* Continue to keep our subreddit free from abuse of all kinds
* Clarify our spam policy

These rules are a draft, suggestions, disagreements, etc, put them below.

At the moment

The main difference you'll see going forward is that we're going to be aggressive in deleting jokes and memes. Our intent with this policy is to make /r/ultimate into a high-quality forum for discussing the sport

1350672517.0,11rekv,Real talk: the hard truth about kitty cat shorts in the online store.,fiveultimate,44,4,44,"Hey everyone

First

The problem is twofold:
1. We can only produce sublimated shorts in large quantities
2. All the posting on Facebook is beginning to like trolling

To Fivers who actually make decisions about what to put in the online store it seems Facebook appears to be overrun with trols.  This is mostly because there are so many posts by just a few people

We can only make sub shorts in very large quantities, you need to prove that we'll sell least a couple hundred pairs.  

Facebook posts are not a very reputable way to prove something like this.  The way we see it, we believe that demand will be much lower.  If you want to prove that there is demand for sublimated kitty cat shorts in the online store it would need to make people put their money where their mouths are, but we'll leave the brainstorming for that system up to you Redditors.

**Here's the good news**: if you want kitty cat shorts for your team or group of friends, so you won't have come up with a design and shipping is free within the US.

I know that screen printing is not the same as a sublimated design

Again

Good luck

Christian
For the Five Team

The tournaments I've been to felt very cookie-cutter, Pineapples at D-1337) that make the tournament slightly different and unique from others. Why are we allowing this generic brand to come in and take over what makes our sport so unique?

I've also been disappointed with the way tournaments have been run, B are obviously power pools but losing either pool automatically kicks you out of the championship bracket? Seems like those teams on the brink would benefit (from a final standings position) of being in the lower pools and winning their way up against weaker teams (TL;DR no matter what two seeds from 13-20 will finish higher than two teams 1-12 making it impossible for seeding to hold).

It's also been brought to my attention that Ultiment is snatching up fields before college teams have a chance to book them making it impossible to host their annual tournaments. I understand it's a business with a first-come-first-served philosophy but booking fields for 1.5 months so local teams don't even have the option of hosting a tournament seems slightly ridiculous.

So I'm curious:

Backstory.

I'm a freshman at a school which is very, there was a while where I could make no plays, and my defense was flat out terrible.  But today, I finally made one decent play, one of those clusterfucky group throws where it goes up, and I just made the grab.  

That one play made all the difference, and I even made a couple decent cuts.

I've got a long ways to go, or several plays, even if you've had a dry streak.  Think about what you are doing and how to change it to make it better.  But above all, and even when you make a mistake, tuck your head down, and keep giving 100%.",,,,

A. A pick can only be called if it occurred when the players were within 3 meters of each other

B. A pick can only be called if the defender is actively reacting to the offensive player

C. A pick can only be called BY the defender who is picked

D. A pick can only be called IMMEDIATELY

E. After a pick is called

F. After a pick is called, whichever was EARLIER, and *then* the picked player catches up.

G. ""Affects the play:"" if you call a pick,"" and the disc goes back.  If you were two steps behind and you weren't going to get there anyway, say ""didn't affect the play.""  You still get to catch up (remember, relative distance), but the disc stays with the receiver.  Why would you call a pick if it didn't affect the play?  So you can get the mark on quickly.  ~~If the pick didn't affect the play and *won't affect the next one*, just yell ""play on.""~~ Edit: as pointed out by epicmoustache, unless your team has possession after the result of the play, you just say ""didn't affect the play

It is a violation to call for the disc as a defensive player!  I've actually seen people throw to the other team.  If this happens to you *or a teammate of yours* (here I am especially thinking about your less experienced players), and mention rule II.C. explicitly.

-----

Citations:

II.C. ...A defensive player may not ... call for a pass from the thrower.

II.U. Violation: Any infraction of the rules other than a foul.

XVI.A. An infraction may only be called by a player on the infracted team who recognizes that it has occurred

XVI.C.2.B.1. If the infraction affected the play (XVI.C.3)

XVI.C.3. An infraction affected the play if an infracted player determines that the outcome of the specific play (from the time of the infraction until play stops) may have been meaningfully different absent the infraction....

If a defensive player loses a catch block due to ground contact, catch it firmly, and then lose it when you hit the ground, it's a block and your team gets the disc.  It's the same deal if you sky someone, and hitting them or the ground causes you to lose the disc.

However, that *is* a turnover.  Likewise if you hand the disc to another player, *even if you're carrying it back from a bricked pull*.

II.F. Ground contact: All player contact with the ground directly related to a specific event or maneuver (e.g., leaning or falling), including landing or recovering after being off-balance. Items on the ground are considered part of the ground.

The line is *out*.  If you are straddling the line, your momentum can take you out-of-bounds (running, diving, or falling) as long as the disc is fully under your control before any part of you touches out-of-bounds.  If you catch it while jumping, diving, or falling and bring the disc fully under control while still in the air, you are considered in bounds if your ""first point of contact"" is fully in bounds.

As everyone knows (and I hear they might be changing for the next rule edition) if you jump from in bounds, it's legal and called a ""World's Greatest,"" or just ""Greatest.""  However, if you jump from out-of-bounds and catch it, it's considered out-of-bounds, even if you throw before you land or land in bounds.  This is because you transfer your in/out-of-bounds status to the disc when you catch it, and your in/out-of-bounds status changes when you land

This applies only to catching.  Once you've established a pivot (which must be fully in bounds)

If the field is unlined (as most are at a low-medium level)

II.J. Line: A boundary defining the playing areas. On an unlined field

1317649092.0,kzbzi,Phred's rules series #5: States of Play,phredtheterrorist,35,7,32,"[(introduction)](http://www.reddit.com/r/ultimate/comments/kva96/phreds_rules_series_introduction/)

There are three states of play: In Play

In play: once the disc has been pulled/checked in, or an infraction.  It is still in play after a turnover unless it goes out of bounds.

Live: Players can move around at will, and touches the disc to the ground.  You *do not have to offer the disc to the other team for a check* if the disc is live.

* A disc is live following a turnover if it landed, establish a pivot and touch it to the ground.

* If the disc lands or rolls out of bounds on a pull, it's a turnover!  (I have never seen that enforced, but it's explicit in the rules).

* When bringing a live disc to the front of the endzone to put into play (if it went out of bounds in the endzone, you again needn't check it in, just touch it to the ground.  You must walk straight up to the endzone line from where the disc came to rest or went out of bounds, but you are free to sprint or to saunter (if you saunter too slowly beware of delay-of-game calls, which will be covered in a separate post).

Dead: After something more interesting happends

* Foul calls, pick calls, stall calls, time-outs (including technical and injury), and *discussions* result in a dead disc.

* To emphasize this point, the disc is dead.  If the teams cannot agree who had best perspective, the disc is dead.  Your team cannot turn it over while you are arguing about a play!

* An offensive check is either the traditional offering of the disc to the defender, the defense must first acknowledge readiness!

*  Occasionally

The Continuation Rule will be its own post

-----

Citations:

R.1. A disc is in play when play may proceed without the defense's acknowledgment. An in-bounds disc on the playing field is in play. The disc is subject to a turnover. To put the disc into play at a particular spot on the field means to establish a pivot at that spot.

II.R.2. A disc is live when players are allowed to move and the disc is subject to a turnover, the thrower must establish a pivot at the appropriate spot on the field, touch the disc to the ground, and put the disc into play.

II.R.3. A disc is dead when play has stopped and can continue only with a check. The disc is not subject to a turnover.

II.S. Stoppage of play: Any halting of play due to a call

II.S(exp). Play-halting calls include ""foul"","" ""pick,"" ""stall"", etc.

VII.9. After a pull

VII.10. There is no stoppage of play when putting the pull into play. If the disc is to be put into play at a location other than where possession was gained

VIII.D.3.a. The marker restarts play by touching the disc in the thrower's possession. If the thrower attempts a pass before the marker checks the disc

VIII.D.4. Offensive Self-check: If play is to restart with a check
		a. the defense must acknowledge readiness; and
		b. the thrower establishes a pivot at the appropriate spot on the field

VIII.D.4(exp). Determine this distance [the distance that requires an offensive self-check] based on the thrower standing upright and extending the disc toward the marker.

VIII.D.5. Defensive self-check: If play is to restart with a check
		a. the disc is placed at the appropriate spot on the field;
		b. the offense must acknowledge readiness; and
		c. the defender closest to the disc loudly announces ""in play.""

X.A. If a turnover results in a team gaining possession in the end zone that they are defending
		1. put the disc into play at the spot of the disc (to fake a throw or pause after gaining possession commits the player to put the disc into play at that spot); or
		2. Carry the disc directly to the closest point on the goal line and put it into play at that spot. If this option is chosen

X.A.2(exp). The player may carry the disc at any speed

XIII.B. For a live disc to be put into play, and put it into play.

XIII.D. If a dispute arises concerning an infraction or the outcome of a play (e.g., play stops, and the disc is returned to the thrower and put into play with a check (VIII.D), with the count reached plus one or at six if over five.

XIX.D. If a dispute arises on the field

XIX.E. If a novice player commits an infraction out of sincere ignorance of the rules

We could do something like best article of the past year, best fulll game video, etc. We could have a category as a comment with people making nominations as a reply to it and upvotes and downvotes can determine the winner. It might make more sense to take the top two upvoted in each category and have a runoff. We would end up with an amazing resource with the best examples of every part of ultimate that could serve as a great collection of best practices. 

I thought of this idea because a friend of mine is trying to develop a website for her women's team and I was considering posting a thread to gather the best ultimate websites to draw inspiration from. I then realized it would be awesome to be able to see the best example of all aspects of ultimate. I love sharing and using best practices and I think there's a ton of room for sharing them in the ultimate community with the [college women resources](http://cwuresources.texasultimate.org/) page being the best example.

I know Skyd already does their own best of but I don't think it would hurt to have a seperate community generated list.

What do people think?

First and most important,"" that's the rule and you best follow it.  Here are the rules if nothing else is specificied:

1. Each team has 2 team time-outs per half.  They don't carry over.

2. Overtime starts when the losing team ties it up one point short of the game total (14-14 in a game to 15, overtime will never occur in this game; it would start at 10-10, but as soon as the leading score 9 the game is over; overtime doesn't begin at 8-8.  When overtime occurs, *all remaining time-outs are thrown out* and each team gets one more.

3. If you call an injury

4. After a goal is scored before the pull

5. If you call time-out and you don't have one

-----

Citations:

V.C. Overtime begins when the score is tied at one goal less than the game total (e.g.

V.C(exp). Overtime begins based on the predetermined game total and is unaffected by time caps. If a time cap applies and makes it a ""game to 14

VI.B. Team Time-out: Each team has two team time-outs per half in a standard game.

VI.B.1. Each team has exactly one team time-out in overtime

VI.B.3. Any player may call a time-out after a goal is scored and before both teams have signaled readiness to start play. Time limit counts between points are suspended for 70 seconds. A time-out may not be called between a re-pull call and the ensuing pull.

VI.B.4. After the pull

VI.B.5.c. The player who had possession of the disc when the team time-out was called restarts play with a check at the pivot spot

VI.C.4. If the injured player does not leave the game after an injury time-out,False,,t5_2qnym,True,,,t3_l4a89
