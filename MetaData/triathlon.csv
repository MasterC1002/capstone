The last 4 years were in no way linear and Ironman was never the goal (until last year). This was my progress...

    Jan 2009 Weight loss competition. Diet: Modified 4hr body. Routine:mostly cardio with some machine work. I was working out in a clubhouse gym

    June 2009 Join a 24hr gym. More resistance training

    Feb 2010 First 5k. 33min

    March 2010: Join Lifetime Fitness. Start Spinning 2-3 times/week. Lifting 6 days week.

    Feb 2011 1st 1/2 Marathon 2:0X:XX

    May 2011 Find Fittit. Stop BS'ing in the gym and start lifting. Dropped the curls, deadlifts, pullups...all the good stuff fittit has taught me.

    Nov 2011 Sign up for IMAZ 2012. Stop drinking during the week.

    Dec 2011 Bought road bike

    Feb 2012 First Marathon 3:5X:XX

    April 2012 First triathlon. 1/2 Ironman 5:3X:XX

    Nov 2012 Ironman Arizona 11:1X:XX

    Advice (for what it's worth)

    Find a diet with food you like. I still eat chicken

    Start doing the big compound lifts

    Interval training works

    You can be an Endurance Athlete on a low carb diet. I did 75% of my IM training on less than 120 carbs/day.

    Stopping drinking really takes off the pounds.

A sincere thanks to you Fittit. Couldn't have done it without you.

1369155282.0,1eruei,Report from a midnight finisher (long).,kvigor,77,3,28,"I did my first full distance race this weekend (HITS Grand Junction). Things did not go according to plan. But I thought y'all might find some interest in this report I wrote up for friends and family anyway. Note that it's intended for a non-triathlete audience




It's after 8:00pm in Highline State Park, the air is chilly. The finish line of my first iron-distance triathlon is about 100 yards away. I haven't eaten in about five hours or been able to hold down fluids for three, but the finish is right there.

What a pity that I've only done one half of the run and still have 13 miles to go. 13.1

So I turned my back on the finish line and my lovely wife and set off into the night. Because that was the plan

The day started very, the water was mirror smooth. I swam straight, knew where I was going, and just felt fantastic the whole time. I came out of the water in one hour thirty minutes, precisely according to plan, and I knew then I was going to make it. The rest of the day was just a formality; the swim was the only thing that could defeat me, and it was behind me.

As it turns out

I took my time changing into bike kit, save my big effort for the finishing run. So off I set at a nice easy pace, aiming for for a 3:30 first lap of the bike course.

My great day was continuing as I set off. The bike felt wonderful, but since they only swam half the distance they were long gone down the road), so I was mostly alone, but everyone I passed or who passed me had a smile and a nod. Once we were clear of the ""town"" of Mack I settled into my aerobars and started grinding along, grinning. What a day!

About twenty miles in a woman I'd passed a few miles back caught me on a slight downhill. She appeared to be quite a bit older, and I decided to be smart and ride my own pace instead of chasing her down.

It turned out she was faster than me downhill or with the wind; I was faster uphill or into the wind. Since the course was twisty and rolling, and we were best buddies now. Unfortunately triathlon rules forbid riding together, so our friendship was developed in very short bursts as we passed each other, but we were definitely getting along.

Ten miles later, but there was a bit of a headwind, so my pace fell off dramatically, to about 12 mph. But what's uphill into the wind going would be downhill with a tailwind coming back, and my GPS said I was still on track for my plan, so I just settled down and kept turning the pedals and smiling.

Near the top I had a near disaster when the cleat on one of my shoes worked loose. Suddenly I was ice-skating on the pedal and almost went down; then I realized I couldn't get the cleat out of the pedal, before I could work on it.

Luckily the cleats have three bolts each; I'd lost two on one shoe (heaven knows how - I'd actually checked them specifically the night before) but I could spare one from the other shoe, but I explained I was fine and she ground on up the hill while I finished up.

A couple of miles later I reached the top of the hill, and finally caught her when the road turned uphill again five miles from the turnaround point halfway through the ride.

I hit the turnaround after 3:33 on the bike. Three minutes behind schedule, I was sticking to the plan. The plan is important.

I was feeling great as I set off again, I said, if this wind kept up.

Oh boy, and up, and pretty soon it was a 30 mph headwind. That extra half hour turned into an extra hour and a half. The downwind bits were delightful of course, but far too brief, and that fifteen miles of uphill into the wind? Well, delightful that was not. Dust devils kept whipping at me across the open plain as I struggled to maintain 5 mph. Tumbleweeds flew by, and to add to the fun lightning kept flashing on the horizon. You do the math: 15 miles at less than 10 mph is... eternity. Better yet, I strongly considered quitting. But... the plan. The plan is important. So I kept turning the pedals, but when I said I was now doubtful about finishing it, you crawl

After a mile or two I passed Bev, but she signaled me OK, so I yelled something inane like ""Stay strong!"" and rode on.

At one point on that return I wasn't pedaling, ""You're doing 30!"". ""No way,"" I said, but a glance at my GPS confirmed it.

I made it back to the transition area after over 8:30 on the bike. Probably the slowest century I've ever ridden, the plan, the sacred plan, was in real danger now. I was meant to get off the bike feeling good for the run, but instead I was shelled. My nausea had improved, but not enough to eat. My legs were wrecked. Run a marathon? Now?

But G was having none of it. I don't remember exactly what she said

I'd been dreaming of chicken broth for the last hour, a mile and a half in, I asked hopefully, ""Chicken broth?"". ""No,"" the nice volunteer said, ""I'm afraid we're out. Something else?""

""Something else?"" I mumbled

So I took a grape and shuffled off tragically.

Five minutes later a truck pulled up. ""You the guy who needs the chicken broth?""

You know, and it was hot and salty and delicious.

Unfortunately about five minutes later (mercifully after the kindly volunteer was out of sight) my stomach decided it would be better hot

But the plan wasn't quite lost yet. For some reason my brain was still working. I could count and add and stuff, but a walk.

All I had to do was to run 13 minute miles for an hour and a half and then I could walk the rest of the way. It was a plan. Not the plan I started with

And by God

There was a weird moment on the second lap when, a guy suddenly caught me. He was running, looking fresh. Where the hell did he come from? Then two more - then three behind them. Having not seen a soul except aid station volunteers for miles and miles, suddenly it was a traffic jam. Pretty soon all those inexplicable runners dropped me and I was alone again. Looking at the results, I have no idea where they went. There aren't enough people who finished in the right timeframe to account for all of them. Maybe I hallucinated them. I was, after all, just waiting for my brain to shut down, the collapse - I'd far outrun my abilities. I had no idea what was fueling me. But my little mental checks coming up positive: I could still count, I could still walk a 15 minute mile.

A couple of miles past the turnaround I saw Bev. She was jogging determinedly, probably more than was realistically possible. Still, I gave her some dumb platitude (""Looking good!"") and she just gave me a grim smile back. Apparently she could still do math too.

So I walked and wondered how I was doing it and I walked some more and then eventually I was gingerly picking my way to the finish (the last 200 yards are across a dam wall; it's 12 feet wide, the race director, was calling encouragement and when I finally replied G, who was with him, exclaimed with relief and it was obvious how worried she'd been. I power-walked through the finish line (what on earth would be the point of running now?), the race announcer woke up with a start to announce to the three of us present that I was finishing, someone handed me a medal

I didn't see Bev finish (I was having a chat with the nice paramedics at that moment) but G tells me she came in at three minutes after midnight. She must have put in a hell of an effort to come that close. Apparently she rejected the medal they offered her, by the way). I've spent probably a total of two minutes interacting with her, but I think she might be a better man than me. I would probably have taken their pity medal.

So. Nearly two years of planning and training. Done. It may not have been as I planned it

You do not need long hours of training and a nutritional plan to do an entry level triathlon.  There is nothing to be scared of. You could probably not use a wetsuit

Triathlons are friendly and competitive in a way unlike most other sports. You are racing yourself.  

It's ok to be slow beginning or just in general. Enjoy the race.  Use your old bike that's laying around a few times instead of budgeting for a new bike before your first race. You'll make personal records that you'll continually  break as you get better. 

I wanted to post this because I see a lot of people looking to get into triathlons and they're trying to figure out which new bike to buy for their first race; or what type of nutrition they should take before/during the race.  I wanted to say slow down

Hi!

To start off I'd like to say thanks for all the information this and other subreddits like /r/Swimming, still unable to swim the distance of 500 yards, let alone in open water. I've been working hard on my other 2 disciplines hardly ever missing a day, but I'm not going as fast as I hoped. My diet has been lacking of recently, and I've gained a few pounds due to poor choices. (side story, I'm down from 245 lbs to 190 lbs at 6'4"" from last year, so really this Tri is my first chance to improve and test out my new vehicle). I always feel like I leave a little out there for next time when I train.

I'm not the old me anymore... This won't slow me down, but I won't.  I could spiral into guilt and/or depression for a month or two, but I won't. This is an opportunity, a great one.

First a disclaimer. I knew in advance what I had gotten myself into. I've watched all the videos

Second disclaimer: English is not my first language. I wrote an extensive report in my own language

Third disclaimer: I tried to make it as ""anonymous"" as possible. I'd love to answer questions

The Norseman has a great name. Mythical proportions

Norseman: Point-to-point race in Norway, 1880 meters. The last 5km is completely unpaved and sometimes with hands and feet. Your support team (in my case my brother) has to go up with you.

Firstly let me say that this is by far the hardest thing I've ever done in competition

For reference: i am a 6 time Irondistance finisher

I've been injured a lot this year and had my worst preparation ever. Had a stressfracture in my foot, and the week before the race I blew my shoulder swimming.  

Ironman (or Iron Distance) is described as a test of character. If I'm honest

I was not prepared.

Not for this. For those who do not want a long story

4400 meter swim. Injured shoulder. Reasonable swimming. Bike start 35km climb to 1200m altitude. Then plateau where the wind comes from the front like crazy. Rain. My cycling gear soaked by a SC mishap. A short climb very hot. Then lots of rain, air inside, immediately puncture again. No more tubes. Support Crew already in T2, 12km away. Called. Already underway. Received tyre from support crew of another athlete . 20 minutes along the of the road. Run quite hot. After 25km the climb starts; from 10%. Bizarre. Last 5 ""dirt road "", in other words scramble over rocks, sometimes with hands and feet. Finish in top 5%. Walk the 5km back down, because of failure of the lift. # BAM!

We left Wednesday to the North. The start was challenging

The trip was good. We slept in Ovre Eidfjord

On the terrace we got the special Norseman menu. Elk Burger

Elk. Burger.

Beware

Friday: first the social swim. 0900 nice splash and sweetness ifrom contest sponsor United Bakeries. My brother also swims with me. A striking face

After a good lunch and a nap

We are warned of dangerous road sections

The night is short, pacing back and forth. Then the cover comes down. I jump a little earlier than I intended, but happily the temperature of the water is not that bad. The field is small, so I hope as little hassle as possible. 

Swimming: 

The horn goes off and I start as controlled as possible. It is still dim, and we have alot of wind. I can not swim full pull, but here I am very happy. Eventually out of the water in the top 5%. Afterwards I hear from several athletes that their gps indicated 4400 meters.

Cycling: 


Flat early on

Then we gat to Dyranut. This is the onset of the plateau. And what you can expect happened. A small hiccup in communication between supportcrew and me. I get my food and water bottles

It is cold and windy on top. My shoulders tense and the wind howls loud

Once in Geilo (pronounced G like a pregnant J!)

4 climbs, but the second climb comes up fast and my knee gets worse too. I choose to get some pain relief and a bicycle shirt, which is complemented by the already wet windstopper. Following we get downpours and hail. Awesome....

And if it is supplemented with fog and it remains seriously cold i also get the arm and knee tubes on. Best choice ever! At that time, with or without glasses, so hard, the rain / hail comes down. ""I quit triathlon moment 2"".

Only the last climb left. The climb to Immingfjell, because I couldn't see a damn thing. Last moment with the SC because you send them forward to T2 to get everything set up.

After Immingfjell there's a 10km ""False flat"" section and then A 30km descent. But then comes the most difficult moment.   You're so focused on the end of the climb

But stopping right then and there is also not an option. The descent is fast

Than 12km before T2. Blowout. I steer to the side of the road and i suppress Wiggins-like impulses. I also doubt whether I have such a beautiful throw in me. A new tube in

Then the Norseman solidarity comes into action. Crew Car and 2 cars from other athletes stop. The last one has a spare tube. I am careful inflating and i'm good to go!. End result: 20 minutes alongside the road. Quickly i pass my SC

At that time

T2: You ride your bike straight into T2

Run:

As bad as I felt,certainly in the valley.

I see my SC regularly and get enough gels and drinks inside. But, very far away, an athlete is in sight.  After about 20km you will see the mountain for the first time. Shrouded in fog, though. Scary sh # t.

Then you are at checkpoint 1. 25km. Zombie Hill can begin. I run as long as possible. But I don't have the strength or the courage. I'm walking with a brisk pace. Still faster than the two athletes in fornt of me that have suddenly appeared. But I gain agonizingly slow. At the checkpoint they provide water

The miles go by agonizingly slowly. 28, but the black shirt is in the pocket. The road is steeper than any movie can express. Walking up, my heart still goes up to Z2 / 3. Here they also tell us that the lift is broken. So everyone (including athletes) will walk back down. All we needed.

The roads leveles off towards the last checkpoint at 37.5km. I try to run


My brother is ready with my backpack. The backpack is my lifeline in case of an emergency. Warm clothes, headlight. He's ready. We're going. Suddenly there are a lot of athletes around! A Norwegian athlete which was with me the whole time around, takes off. Weird to see it, so smooth. Eventually took 10 minutes out of me. Amazing!!

For me, but she can not talk. Moments later, the later female winner passes her (and me), and leaves us standing like spectators. So smooth she flies up the mountain. The path is sometimes invisible and impassable, hands and feet simultaneously. Perhaps i should have put on sturdier shoes for the last part. But then suddenly the finish. I am there....


The finish is rather small

We walk down. My Iron Sherpa acts first as leaning post

The local pizza tastes good. The bed is delicious. The black t-shirt is even better.

Epilogue:

The morning after I was convinced that I would never come back. Broken, that must change. I will come back .There is nothing like this, this is like really addictive drugs.

1347976419.0,102ua1,IRONMAN Wisconsin 2012 Race Report - wall of text,hollywood8550,47,4,34,"**Morning of the Race**

Slept surprisingly well, and finally got dressed. I kept feeling like I was missing something, but having dropped off my bike, T1, and T2 bags the day before, and prepping my special needs bags the night before, there really wasn’t a lot I needed that morning. My girlfriend, dropped me off at the Capitol and then went back to the hotel so she could take the shuttle back. I dropped my special needs bags off and strolled down to my bike. It was chilly, filled my aero bottle, but when I left it there was a short line

**Swim**

At 7:00am, so I’m used to getting to the front of the pack quickly; this start was very different. Around 2500 people, all starting at once, and those around me having my same goal; get out front. I had a swim goal time of 1:00, but after the first few minutes of the swim, I knew that wouldn’t be possible simply due to all the time I lost trying to get my own lane to swim in without getting kicked, elbowed, so having Monona Terrace to look at every other breath was nice, and the enormity of the race was starting to set in. Thankfully (in a way), which came at a price. Probably 2/3 the way through the swim

**Bike**

The first few miles of the bike were a blur; I was focused on getting my heart rate down to Z2,000 bike rig and that flat cost his every time advantage a disk wheel and aero helmet would give him, and then some; I felt bad for him, but it made me glad I listened to my coach and avoided renting race wheels for the day. As a strong swimmer and weak cyclist, you get used to being passed a lot on the bike, but the first 20 miles of the bike was a whole new level; I would have groups of 10 riders pass me at once. Every time they passed and I got tempted to follow, I just looked at my HR and chanted my race mantra, and was sticking to my race plan as best as possible. About 1:00 into the bike, which was confirmed when I stopped to pee for a very long time at mile 20 (I’m not going for Kona, etc)

1371925668.0,1gv7t6,Completed my First Sprint Triathlon this morning. This is what I learned.,xandercrewss,37,5,11,So i'm pretty good at running completed a marathon last month and have been working on my biking and swimming which i didn't really do much before.  Completed my first sprint it was 300m swim 16.1 bike and 3.1 run.  This was a really small fundraiser race for a local pool.  The swim went great finished at 5:42 faster then i planned and it was hard running to t1 i was suprised.  Then putting my socks and bike shorts on probably looked hilarious.  I went trhough it in my head multiple times but I ended up looking like an idiot falling over trying to put everything on in a rushed panic but i managed to do it pretty quick.  Then the bike I pushed really hard my bike is pretty weak I usually bike at about 18mph if i really push in central pa we have a lot of hills so that messes with my average mph. I finished just under an hour at i think about 57 minutes. The problem is i had to ride about 2.5 to 3 miles on a flat in the front.  Made it a little harder but i suck at changing tires so i knew it would be faster to lean back and ride it and it wasn't to bad.  Then t2 was fast just slipped my shoes on and off.  The first part of the run was up a big hill and down.  Right off the bat it hit me hard and I quickly realized how hard it is to going from all out biking to all out running.  My breathing was tough my lungs were killing me it was so hard.  Hardest run of my life and I was ready to puke coming back up the hill at the finish.  But I finshed without stopping with a final time of 1:32:32.  It was a ton of fun and can't wait for my next but I learned a ton especially with the run man that was hard.  I came in 3rd in my age group tho.  I know i went all out the entire time and don't think i could of finished any faster without puking unless I didn't get a flat again.  Thought r/triathlon would enjoy reading about my experience.  ,t5_2qhyh,True

Going into the race:
I could do all the events individually with no problem. I had ridden a few 30+ mile rides, but I figured a mile an hour boost wouldn't be worth dropping $1000+ when I could get this same gain by getting in better shape. I went in with no wetsuit.

**Day of the race:** 

Swim - Water temp was 65 degrees

Bike - The path was hilly and windy. It didn't go to badly. I thought to myself a pace of 15 mi/hr would be sustainable for my first triathlon

Run - The run was tough. It was a trail-running route with rolling hills. My goal was 50 minutes, I had to stop, stretch, walk a few feet, and continue running. If I had done a sprint, I could have anticipated this.

Transitions: I don't care yet. I didn't rush


Final thoughts - The race went OK, sure. The race would have gone smoother if I would have started with triathlon I knew I could do rather than one at the edge of my ability. ",,False,self,t5_2qhyh,False,,

I was in the first wave of guys in the water. I don't have a wetsuit and I don't wear a watch, so I think I was sitting anywhere from 15-20th position. Around mile 5ish? there was a sharp downhill left turn with haybales lining the sides of the road to keep people from flipping over the rails and falling down the side. Unfortunately, some loose hay had gotten strewn over the course. I tried scrubbing speed but it was too late. My front tire slipped and I went down. Helmet 100% saved my life. Without a doubt I would be in critical condition or more likely dead. I immediately got back up and tried getting back on though. There was too much adrenaline to keep me from trying to race. But my tire bead slipped the rim and my chain fell off. A policeman stationed at the turn jogged over and offered assistance. It was at this point where the pain was overcoming the adrenaline and I started feeling it. One thing leads to another and soon I'm in the hospital for suspected concussion, road rash, and fractured ribs. Luckily no broken bones and no adverse symptoms of a concussion. My race was over though. My bike got trashed as well. I now need new shoes, a new helmet, new saddle, and possibly a new rear wheel and crankset. Thankfully

I loved every second of it. Running through the sand into transition was amazing. I know that without a doubt I'm hooked on this for a loooong time. I have 2 more tris this summer so I've got opportunities to redeem myself and win my age group. For a first race,,False,self,t5_2qhyh,False,,True

My overall time was 2:52:20 and the times for the events were 00:28:51/01:21:43/00:54:28. I rode my Kona Jake the Snake cyclocross bike. We had a solid headwind on the way out and a corresponding tailwind on the way back for the ride.

This was a huge success for me and I went back and forth between loving it and promising myself I'd never do it again. I'm not scared of water nor nervous at all to be pushed under

For preparation I swam twice a week with a tri class at my local Y with an awesome coach

I wanted to post because I'm excited

Edit: I don't mean to presume that an olympic is the best choice for a first race

Hadn't swam laps before in my entire life.  I really struggled at first... I was breathing every two strokes and felt like I was drowning.  I'd swim to the other side of the 25m pool and hold onto the edge as I caught my breath.  After a week of this I read online somewhere the idea of not kicking at all when learning to swim. It made a day and night difference... I could swim several laps without stopping and gradually added a slow kick back in (maybe two kicks per stroke).  Also

Biking and running were more straightforward... Ran 4 times/week and biked only 1 time a week (though for a longer distance usually 30-40 mi).  By October I had lost a little over 20 lbs.

I thought I was mostly prepared for the tri... I had bought shorts, etc but on the day before I realized that I had no wetsuit.  I checked the water temp and it showed an average temp of 62F for October... oops.  It was too late to get one, nor did I really want to pay for it as money is a little tight now.  To begin with, I wasn't really fully confident about the swim since it was my weak discipline and I also had never swam in open water.  After looking at the hypothermia chart I decided to at least try since I allegedly would have 2 hours before it set in.

I arrived to the race and was relieved immediately when I put my foot in the water... It felt refreshingly cool

My only tip for the bike leg for newbs like me would be to check and see if water is passed out during the bike leg (i assume it is for longer distances but i may be wrong)... It wasnt in this case and luckily I had read this beforehand and put a bottle on the bike.

Of course I didn't do any brick workouts before the race and it was an extremely weird feeling getting off the bike and starting the run... Had to concentrate to avoid falling over. The only thing I could compare it to is jumping on a trampoline for a period of time and then getting off and jumping up and down... I felt like I was running in slow motion.  I assumed I was jogging about a paltry 11:00 mi but looked down at my garmin watch and realized I was running a 7:30 (i usually run at about 8:50 - 9).  Forced myself to slow down since I knew 7:30 probably wasnt sustainable for me after the swim and bike.  

Ended up with 1:33:27. Event was .5 mi swim (15:46), it was a great time and everyone was so supportive and friendly.  To anyone who is considering doing one I really recommend it.  I know ill be doing more of them!",,False,self,t5_2qhyh,False,,

This post has been a long time coming. Last summer I wanted to make some serious life changes including quitting smoking, but I always kept the Olympic as my main goal. We completed the race last month, my dad got first in his age group (he was the only one !) with a time of 3:27 and I got 12th in my age group (30-34) with a time of 2:28. We were both extremely happy with the race and can't wait to do another.

I learned a lot from the community here at /r/triathlon and just wanted to say thanks for all the good info. I also wanted to share a couple things I learned going from zero to Olympic without any real background.

One of the things I heard a lot about triathlon is that it is too expensive and truth is it can be. However I try to think about it in terms of how much enjoyment I get out of it vs the cost of it. It also helps that I am not spending money on alcohol or smokes anymore.

The first thing I would recommend would be to do your research. Get yourself some books and read as much online as you can. I feel I benefited immensely from learning how to run

Another piece of advice would be to get swimming instruction if you can afford it. I was able to take a few private lessons and it made all the difference in the world. And my Dad swears by his Masters class. I was lucky enough to live next to the ocean so I did the majority of my swim training in open water, my body wasn't ready to handle all that punishment, but the stretching and foam rolling helped me with my recovery. I definitely over-trained in the beginning and suffered a couple injuries because of it, so make sure you listen to your body.

I was never quite fast on the short distance, before I set my goal for this year: an OD Triathlon. Running is something I know I have to work on. This morning was supposed to be a test 10km run, fish oil and a peanutbutter sandwich)

Within 500m it felt like my breakfast was going to come back out through the same hole it had entered shortly before.

I was sitting against a tree to get my stomach to settle when I looked around. The weather was beautiful, others were clearly couples very much in love slowly wandering through the green pastures, and quite a number of them were runners training for their own big goals.

I put the distance I wanted to run out of my mind, so instead of turning back to run the full circle for a total of 10km I figured I might as well keep running. After moving to a new house only 6 weeks ago, I'd never really seen what was further up the road, and this was a good chance to go and explore. The first set ended (Monkey Safari Live), and one of my favorites came on (Homework @ Le Bain - Standard Hotel), I kept going and before I knew it the Runkeeper lady told me I'd been running for 55 minutes, for a total of 10km.

Wew

Past Sunday I was discussing whether or not it was possible to go from never having run more than 5km in my life to a 10 mile race in the first week of June. My dad was adamant it wouldn't be possible. It requires more training. I wanted to see if I could do it, 12km, 13km, 14km, 15km all came and went. Then came the magic words: 1 hour 35 minutes, distance: 16.58km. Ten miles.

I'll be damned if I stop now. Every year in The Hague, and had always thought it would be so cool to run in the main event. I wanted to see if I would be able to accomplish that distance, I didn't really care if I had to crawl for the last 2 kilometers.

Things started to hurt, 5 minutes. Distance: 21.2km. Half a marathon.

This past weekend I finally completed my first Triathlon. I was a modest starting Sprint with a 600 yd open water lake swim, triathlete. As organized events go, in the intervening time I have completed both a 5k and a 10k mud run and completed a regular 5k running race. The most I have biked in one go is 25 miles and I am regularly running a 10k distance 3 times a week. I am also currently swimming a non-stop mile in the water twice a week. 


Now that I have the past goals behind me I look back and enjoy each and every organized event I've been through. I was expecting the triathlon to be a lot like the mud races I had been doing, the kinship felt with the fellow participants and excitement of the event was still quite enjoyable. I also feel there is a more serious commitment a triathlete makes in preparing for one. I'm obese and slow, yet due to the fact I have been actively training, I am passing a large amount of the field at the mud runs and and going through obstacles at a stronger pace and less winded then people half my weight who at least look like they should be more fit. It's evident to me that the vast majority of the people going to a mud race have no notion or concept of training to participate, but nearly everyone at the triathlon clearly has been taking the sport more serious and showing more dedication. This is even more evident in the race results. At the mud race, my slow/obese self posted a time better than 60% of the participants. Yet at the Sprint Triathlon this past weekend, I placed better than only 10% of the participants. I did not go slower in the triathlon and I was not slowed down by fatigue. In fact


So now, so I'm practiced at swimming a straight line without having something to guide me I can look at while my head was under water. However, I was contending with people swerving left and right around me and while I would gain on someone, I found it near impossible to pass them without going quite a deal out of my way, so ultimately I just slowed to their pace and avoided letting them kick me in the face. 

In my haste and excitement in the first transition, I was used to running in wet socks anyways. I take that as a note for the future to remember to take a couple of extra seconds to dry my feet before putting on the socks. The bike run started out well and I did enjoy not having to slow down or stop at stop signs due to the course being blocked off by police. I metered my water consumption throughout the biking leg and halfway through, I pulled out the energy gel I had packed away for this leg of the trip. Wow, this was something I wasn't prepared for. The energy gel I had was absolutely repulsive and I nearly threw up trying to get it down. I got it down anyways, but I have to find either a different brand or a different plan for refilling myself during the bike run. Other than that, the biking leg was fairly uneventful and went smoothly. 

I came into the second transition ready to run. I had done some bricks to practice transitioning from bike to run several times and haven't ever found it a difficult transition to make. I anticipate as I get stronger and can use my muscles to higher effectiveness, it's fairly warm this time of year, so I was thankful that most of the running route was along tree shaded sidewalks. I did not stop to walk at any point across the race and water stations were well placed. Whereas on the bike I did not pass anyone and many people passed me, I was regularly passing people on the run. As I pulled around the final tenth of a mile I broke out into a full paced run and came across the finish line giving it all I had.

Now, so here's my results: Swim: 14:34 / T1: 1:48 / Bike: 43:06 / T2: 0:32 / Run: 33:01 / Total: 1:33:03 

Comparing myself to other people, and I recaptured lost ground on the run. Now as I look to the future, I have my eyes set on an Olympic triathlon later this year and I intend to focus on making a shift to getting more heavy on the bike training.

_________________________________________________________

**Overview and Basics**

Pretty much all swim workouts consist of a warm-up

A) 6x100 @ 2:00 **OR** B) 6x100 :20 rest

Both versions = swim 6 sets of 100 yards each; stop for rest after each 100

Version A assumes that you will complete your 100 yards in LESS THAN 2 minutes

Version B means that you will complete 100 yards

Sets will generally tell you to swim, or drill. ""Swim"" always means freestyle, usually at a moderate pace. ""Kick"" (sometimes abbreviated as 'k') can be kicking on with a board or on your back . ""Pull"" (p) means using a pull buoy, placed between either your thighs or your ankles, no kicking. ""Drill"" (d) means do any of a variety of useful swimming drills; they typically emphasize one aspect of freestyle and are designed to improve your form. 

**Workout**

* 500 choice warm up
* 6x75 kick/drill/swim by 25 @1:45
* 4x200 swim descend 1-4 @3:40
* 300 pull 3/5/7 hypoxic by 25
* 4x100 build @ 2:00
* 6x75 free/non-free/free by 25 @1:30
* 8x25 IM order @:30
* 200 cool down

**Workout Breakdown**

500 choice warm up -- ""Choice"" just means whatever you want to do - swimming

6x75 kick/drill/swim by 25 @1:45 -- A set that says ""X/Y/Z by 25"" means do each for 25 yards; so for this set, and then swim 25. 

4x200 swim, the next one should be a bit faster, and the last one should be hard and very fast. Sometimes a long set will have you descend twice, i.e. 6x100 swim, descend 1-3, 4-6. This means that after you complete your 3rd 100 at a hard speed/effort, you can restart your 4th 100 at an easy pace. Sometimes abbreviated as ""desc.""

300 pull 3/5/7 hypoxic by 25 -- Hypoxic breathing is a great way to ~~build your lung capacity~~ make a set more intense, breathe every 3 strokes. On the 2nd 25, breathe every 5 strokes. On the 3rd 25, breathe every 7 strokes. Repeat until you complete 300 yards. 

4x100 build @2:00 -- ""Build"" means that within the distance, you should be going at an easy pace, and by the time you complete it, you should be going fast. The next 100 is the same: start easy, finish fast. This is NOT the same thing as descending!

6x75 free/non-free/free by 25 @1:30 -- ""Non-free"" is exactly what is sounds like - any stroke besides freestyle. Again, swim freestyle 25. May also be written as ""stroke"" instead of non-free. If you aren't comfortable with the different strokes, you can do anything that isn't regular freestyle, such as kicking or pulling. 

8x25 IM order @:30 -- ""IM"" stands for Individual Medley, breaststroke, and freestyle. For this set, your first 25 yards would be butterfly, the 2nd 25 backstroke, and so on. For the 5th 25, you would start over with butterfly again. If you aren't comfortable/familiar with the different strokes

200 cool down -- Do whatever you feel like doing (slow freestyle/stroke

1350340811.0,11jbt8,In Memory,nenox,25,0,6,"A friend passed away tragically this Saturday while riding her bicycle on the Pacific Coast Highway near Malibu.  She was training for Ironman Arizona next month

 

I’m not sure I’m qualified to call her a friend.  I only ran with her once up Echo Mountain, or while running at the Rose Bowl.

 

She was young.  Young enough to leave behind a grieving mother.  Too young to die.  Her passing served as an unwelcome reminder of our short time here on Earth.  Whether we’re here for 30 years or 90, Laziness, Pride, or Fear are only EXCUSES we use to convince ourselves that now is not the time.

 

The outpouring of shock and grief on my friend’s facebook page serve as testament to her grace and inspiration.  As a mentor for the Leukemia Society’s Team in Training program, and friends.  Ironman Arizona was to be her first full distance triathlon.

I arrived the day prior to the race. A quick packing of different bags later I went to bed. At 04 AM the alarm went off, it was cold as well. 13-14 C was measured.

The swim went ok. The water was absolutely still and I found some legs to draft on. Almost 90 minutes later I found myself in the most quiet T1 I've ever seen. No rushing or stress

The bike leg was pretty brutal. The height profile can be seen [here](http://nxtri.com/race_info/course_and_map). Not much to do on the first ascent then find the lowest gear and take your time. I had divided the leg into four parts and found some ""pass no later than this, this was the closest I came to crying all day. Work, work, work with little to show for it. In total I used my ""no slower than this"" time on this part of the course. The next part of the leg, in my head, was over the three next mountains and to the base of the last. Luckily I got what I expected. The trees took most of the wind and with my slow speed it was ok. The week leading up to the race I have created the course on bikeroutetoaster.com and loaded onto my Garmin Edge. This gave me the elevation for the next two kilometers and I hardly took my eyes of the screen. The summits came exactly when I knew they would and all was good. With the help from my excellent support I dumped all my warm clothes before each climb and got them back for the downhill sections. The first hill chilled my knees so much I took two plastic bags and put them over my knees under the pants. This stopped the wind effectively and saved my day. On the third of the five hills the rain came. Without glasses this added a fine touch to an already glorious day. Some misery later I was on top of Imingfjell covered in fog and was ready for downhill. At this time I had big winter gloves, arm warmers, thick jacket

In T2 I met my family who chatted with me while I changed. My support gave a discreet ""maybe we should turn around so he can change"" to tell my unknowing family that changing here is in the parking lot without any tents. 

The first 25km of running is very uneventfull. At 19km you see the mountain for the first time and you are struck with awe from the size of it and what you are about to climb. Or so I've been told. Fog covered the whole damn thing. With my knees still hurting I made it to 25k and the final ascent. This is steep. ""Zombie Hill"" is 10km of 10% elevation grade, just grinding it out. It was bitter, but also ok to not go to the top. I turned at 37km and ran down (down!) the last kilometers to the finish. 

Looking back I am not as tired as after my last Iron-distance. I had saved a lot of strenght for that last

Still

I didn't own a road bike so I borrowed my brothers $100 CL special.  I've ridden it a few times so I am familiar enough with it.  I went to pick it up last night at about 8:30 and was just putting around in the parking lot to make sure everything was in working order.  I was shifting through all the gears and when I went to put it into the lowest gear i heard a pop and the bike skidded to the stop.  I inspected the damage and the rear derailleur had caught a spoke got pulled all the way around the frame.

Needless to say, and obviously, no bike shops are open.  Finally, after exercising all my other options, i made a trip to the super mega walmart and bought a very sexy, $159.99 GMC Denali road bike.  

Did the bike portion with the tags still on it.  I didn't even get a chance to adjust the seat before the race.  Except for the horrible shifting

It was a dark and cloudy day as I showed up with a nervous air to my first open water tri. Dumping my stuff like an anxious shrew next to someone's expensive gear

To save the details, grunting, swearing, and generally looking like an idiot, I was standing in the water, clad in my super speedy wetsuit looking like I was straight outta the avengers. 

I'll preface this part by admitting that I haven't swam in 3 months (moved back home and don't want to pay $4.50 per time for the tiny pool here)

Of course

Feeling great, done in A-B-A order (both were out and backs) so I was able to see how many were in front of me. By the finish of leg B, i'd placed myself firmly in 4th and was all out flying. I spent the last leg off the seat and pumping myself, bringing me to a tie for 3rd just as we hit T2. 

As the other cyclist slapped his teammate (whom I think was his young son, way too obsessed with gaining the lead to care about changing my soaked socks, and hit the road hard. 

Passed the kid not problem

My legs were catching on, with me hungry. another kilometre down, and it was me and a jacked ironman (I could tell from his calf tattoo) just both gunning for the lead. 

And then I passed him. Just keeping on my pace I shot past him and kept pushing. All the other racers headed the other way cheered for me

I kept opening up space over the next kilometre

Fuck.

I'd missed the turn off.

I turned, just to finish 10 seconds behind 2 people I'd already passed.

1344963687.0,y7lhh,I had a breakthrough in swimming yesterday.,Atheose,29,8,24,"From my blog http://projectiron.blogspot.com/ 

When I first started running two years ago I couldn't go a full mile without having to stop and walk. So I could run for half a mile, and could run up to 7 miles at a 10:00/mile pace by doing this. One day my wife came with me to run, and I stayed with her at a much slower pace (11:00/mile) for the start. She dropped off after 5 minutes, but I kept going at that pace. My runkeeper app notified me when I passed one mile, then two, then three. Before I knew it I had completed the entire 5 mile loop at Newport News park, all without having to stop. I had found the perfect groove to run in without exhausting myself too quickly.

Yesterday I had the same sort of breakthrough in swimming.

I forced myself to swim as slow as possible, as was the third. It started getting a little more difficult after that, but still easy enough that when I reached 500m I kept going. I stopped briefly at 750m to get some water out of my goggles and to look at the clock: 15:17, a pace of 2:02/100m. In the final 250m my arms got noticeably more tired and my form started unraveling, but I finished the 1km in 22:11, a pace of 2:13/100m.

This sudden breakthrough is attributable to several changes I've made in the last week or so:

* Doing 75-freestyle
* Breathing every two strokes instead of every three.
* Forcing myself to maintain a slow pace. In the past as I got more and more out-of-breath I would speed up in order to breathe more often
* Exhaling harder under the water to make sure I get most of the air out of my lungs.

--------BACKGROUND STORY--------------

Back around November, the weight had been slowly creeping back on.  That slow creep had only accelerated since my son had been born about a year earlier and, at 6 foot 1 inches tall, I was back up to 228 pounds (dangerously close to 250, my all-time high).  At the same time, a few of the more athletic people from my office sent out an email to the company - they were planning on doing the Philadelphia Triathlon the following June and anyone who wanted to join them was encouraged to sign up.  We'd all be able to support each other with the knowledge that we were doing the same race.  Initially, I thought I could handle getting in shape for the bike and run

Quickly, 2x Sprint plan).  The stories of my training are scattered in the comments of the ""Tell us how your training went this week"" posts from earlier this year, so I won't recount those.  The incredibly mild winter we had this year allowed me to train outside all winter long, which was incredibly useful.  By the end of March/early April, I was feeling really confident about my fitness and ability to do the race.  

But of course

------------- THE RACE ---------------

Friday afternoon I went to the race site to pick up my packet.  After that, it was in the 90's and pretty humid on Friday - but that didn't do lots for my confidence, if 20-30 minutes of walking around got me that sweaty.  Then it rained Friday night - which helped kill the heat and humidity, but now I was concerned that the swim might be cancelled and replaced with a run - and I did NOT think I could do 2 runs - swimming was my strength.  I ate some plain pasta for dinner, drank some Gatorade to pre-hydrate and went to bed at about 9 PM - shockingly I was able to get to sleep.

Saturday I was up at 4:45 - took a quick shower, I bumped into some of my other coworkers (other first-timers who had signed up) and immediately relaxed.  We were all in it together, now.  I set up my transition area, and we all lined up to wait for our swim wave.  I was in the 6th starting wave - a full 30 minutes of standing around hearing the horn start off other age groups before I got to go.  


----The Swim-----  
By the time came for my age group to get into the water for our in-water start I was EXCITED and rearing to go.  My plan for the swim was to stick to the back - I was doing breaststroke (my strongest stroke and much easier to do sighting with my head bobbing out of the water on every stroke) and I didn't really want people behind me to kick in the head.  I even followed a friend's advice to just sit in the water and count to 10 after the horn blew to get a little space around me.  I was expecting the swim to be a madhouse of bodies in the water but it really wasn't.  As I started going I found that I was passing a good number of people in my age groups (we wore colored swim caps to identify our age groups so it was really easy to spot in the water).  By the end of the swim

-----T1------   
I took a leisurely stroll into the transition area to where my bike was racked, scarfed them down and attempted to wipe down my feet, pull on socks and get my biking shoes on - all the while trying to regain my breath and feeling of leg-stability.  I got up, unracked my bike and began walking (still was not ready to be running out of transition) to the mount line - nervous about how tired I already was.

[NTC Masters Swim](http://www.ntcmastersswim.blogspot.com/)

It's a blog that consists purely of weekly swim workouts from the National Training Center in Florida. Workouts are posted 2-3 times a week, from 2000-4000 meters, so you can pick the one that fits your needs, skill level, and time constraints. It also has sections that define terms which might be unfamiliar to beginners, and where specific drills are explained. 

I've been swimming for more than 15 years, and a little for college. When I got into triathlon a couple years ago I had a hard time finding places to get satisfactory swim workouts, that matched the quality I had come to expect from years of being coached. Most of the ones I found were too short, really vague, or just plain boring. This site is excellent! If I don't like the WOD I can go back a couple years and find one that suits me. Been using it for a couple months and haven't been disappointed yet! :)

Total Time = 12h 25m 57s
Overall Rank = 145/652
Age Group = M25-29
Age Group Rank = 13/31

Pre-race routine:

Went to bed at 8PM Friday night and then woke up at 4AM Saturday morning. Transition opens at 5:30 and I wanted to be there right at the beginning. I ate a couple of bananas and had some orange juice for breakfast. I applied my first coat of sunblock before leaving the house. Quick drive to the course and got lucky on parking as I was early and got a little lucky finding some on the side of the street. Not too much trouble setting up my T1. However

Event warmup:

I didn't have much time to warm up (excluding running around the beach) since I was almost late for my wave (1st) start. I got in the water with about 2 minutes to spare and barely had enough time to setup my 910 and get my goggles adjusted.


SWIM
1h 15m 17s 4224 yards 01m 47s / 100 yards

Comments:

My goal time for the swim was 1:20-1:30 based upon my swim time at HITS Napa. Overall I was very happy with my swim considering it is my weakest discipline. At the start of the swim I was having serious problems with my goggles not being set properly. I had to flip over on my back a couple times in the first 250 meters to adjust my goggles. Once I got this set everything went flawlessly. Most of the course I was breathing to my left side every other stroke. Since you have to keep the buoys on your left all the time this worked well. During the shallow sections at the top of the course I found that the walking was actually slower than the swimming. I found that what worked best for me was grabbing at the river bed with my hands and effectively walking on my hands down this stretch. YMMV as this will depend on your arm length and the water level at the day of the race.
What would you do differently?:

Get in the water sooner than 2 minutes before my wave. This would give me a bit of time for warm up and setting my goggles. Overall very happy with this swim.

TRANSITION 1
06m 24s

Comments:

I still had a bunch of excess gear in T1 because I didn't manage to hand off to my mother before the start. Luckily I managed to spot her coming out of the water and I let her know what was going on. I had to run from my bike back to the fence where the spectators were in order to hand off a big gym bag of gear so I lost a little time here. No major problems in T1 but I just need more practice. I used some cooking spray on my ankles and it worked great. My wetsuit came right off and didn't get stuck at all. By the time I was exiting the ground was already quite muddy and I know I lost some time making sure to get my feet clean before I put on my socks and getting them into my shoes before they got dirty. I have no issue giving up a couple seconds in T1 to make my bike more comfortable. 

What would you do differently?:

Make sure to get get T1 properly prepped so that I don't have to run back and forth with gear. Also with all the mud I might have opted for a larger towel in order to help keep my feet from getting dirty before I got my shoes on. I still need a bunch of practice on my T1.


BIKE
6h 05m 20s  112 miles  18.41 mile/hr

Comments:

I was aiming for 6:00:00 on the bike so I got pretty close to that and I am overall happy with the bike. Based on my FTP I was targeting 170-175 Watts for the bike segment. I started out at ~190 and I had to spend the first 1/4 of the race calming myself down. Also my power was more erratic that I would have preferred. While my normalized power was 166W my average was 149W. Ideally I'd like to see those be a bit closer than that. I managed to hold myself back on the hills which was a good thing. I stayed in my saddle the entire time and spun up the hills. My cadence went a little lower than I would have liked on some of the hills up to and including chalk hill. I guess I just need to get stronger as I was already riding on a 11-28 with a compact. The sun started coming out on the second loop and I got a bit burned between my trisuit and my cool wings. It didn't bother me at all during the race but it was frustrating in the days after. For nutrition I had two bottles of highly concentrated malto. I started with one on the bike and I picked up the other at special needs. This worked very well for my needs. I should have been drinking more water though from my aero bottle through the day. Although I didn't have any problems with dehydration I could have ended up in a bad place if it had been hotter.

What would you do differently?:

Go out slower than you think necessary and ramp it up later in the course. Also I was riding on my Cervelo R3 with clip ons as it was the only bike I had at the time. I now have a tri bike for my next tri and I've had a proper fit done on it. With a properly fit tri bike I should be able to stay in an more aero position for longer and improve my speed without any additional power. Also should make sure to put some sunblock in special needs so that I can reapply part way through the day.

TRANSITION 2
05m 46s

Comments:

My time isn't too bad here considering how large T2 was. There was a long run in between the dismount line and the racks. Same applies with the racks to the run start. I didn't have any issues with transitioning here.

What would you do differently?:

With more practice I can definitely knock a minute or so off here. In general though I'm happy with it. 


RUN
4h 53m 12s  26.2 miles  11m 13s  min/mile

Comments:

Just like the bike I started off faster than I would have liked. However

What would you do differently?:

I was aiming for 4:30 on the marathon. Although I was a decent way off from this I was still very happy with my performance on the run. I definitely have some time I can take off here though if I was pushing myself. I found the run to be easier than I expected. If it wasn't for my garmin I wouldn't have thought that I had run a full marathon. I found that my mind was so far gone that I wasn't counting off the miles like I would in a normal marathon which made it mentally a lot easier. Next time I am going to work on pushing the pace on the later stages of the run so I can properly negative split the marathon.


POST RACE

Warm down:

Not much off a cooldown here. I walked over to the athlete feed area and ate whatever I could get down(not much). I would see a delicious looking cookie and start eating it. Then two bites in my stomach would no longer be interested in eating it. 

What limited your ability to perform faster:

As my first iron distance race this was a big learning experience for me. I am surprised I managed to get so close to my goal times considering it was my first iron distance. I think what I need to work on the most beyond general fitness is refining my pacing. I should have been negative splitting both the bike and run. Also with one IM under my belt now I should be able to set better paces at the start of the bike and the run. We will see how this works out at IMLT.

I took away three things from this experience (training and competing...sort of):

1) I love having an external goal to guide and shape my internal goals of health and weight loss.

I went from weighing in at 315 lbs and being unable to run longer than a few minutes in January to weighing in at 279 lbs and finishing the bike and run portions of a Sprint tri (I'm pretty sure I could have done the swim too!).

2) The people involved with the sport are totally kick ass and I had a great time yesterday bs-ing with folks and cheering on/being cheered on by all the other competitors.

3) I need to train to ride more hills! 1346 ft of ascent over the course nearly took my legs right off.

It was a great experience and I'm looking forward to my next race. I haven't decided whether I should find another sprint nearby (time wise) or go for something towards the end of summer and ramp up for an OLY distance.

The UCI is the one that does the actual stripping of the titles
As UCI/IOC is a signatory to the WADA code they are obligated to follow USADA's recommendation but currently they are waiting for documents from USADA before a final decision.  It is largely a procedural and paper work matter at this point but there is still the possibility of the UCI breaking their own rules and not following through with USADA's decision.

1370798995.0,1fznm8,Race Report: My first sprint!,Psyyx,17,2,9,"**Event:** Maasdijk Sprint Triathlon

**Distances:** 500m

**Swim Gear**: Sailfish Attack Wetsuit

**Bike Gear**: Wilier 705 XC 2012 MTB with Schwalbe Big Apple tires and a pair of 9 dollar platform pedals

**Race Report**: 
120 people at the start line ready for action. Most of them in wetsuits

The first 100-150m of the swim was crowded, turned the second and final buoy and started making my way back to the beach. I added some extra kick to wake my legs up and made it to the beach.

I ran out of the water and almost collapsed. I was completely disoriented. I somehow ran to my spot in the transition area and started what would become the slowest triathlon transition of all time. The cord on the wetsuit zipper was stuck behind the zipper itself, but managed to get my feet out.

I grabbed my towel

In the end

The bikeride was tough. Because this was a triathlon that doesn't circle around the same transition area, directly in our face, and we were riding on dikes, so were above the protection of the bushes on either side of the road.

People were passing me left and right. Most of them were on beautiful time trial bikes, cheering us on all the way. My original plan was to get through the 22km in 45 minutes, but I quickly realized this wasn't happening. It was all about damage control, so I stuck to a gear I could maintain without too much lactic acid buildup, which puts me around a 50:00 ride for 22k.

My legt felt like jelly when I got to T2, and started the run. It took about 500m before my calves and hamstrings were on the edge of cramping up. I kept on going, as I had experienced this before and knew it would take a while before my legs were in run mode. I was with a large pack of runners, all running at the same pace. Occasionally chatting a bit, we dragged our sorry butts to the finish line. The last kilometer my legs actually felt great, and I was able to speed up significantly.

I crossed the finish line in 1 hour 26 minutes flat

Digressing a little, so he can't start that long road up redemption avenue like other cyclists Millar etc. have.

Here we go!!  Saturday I was up fairly early leaving early on my way to the poconos for my first 70.3!  Got my race packet, got body marked, and checked out the merchandise I was GOING to buy after I finished the race but they sold out!!  Once that was done it was off to T1 to drop off my bike and check out the lake!  My first impression of the lake was it was a little choppy but it was also fairly windy when we were there racking the bikes.  Just adding to my nervousness at this point, I swam a mile in an Olympic 2 weeks ago, but this easily looked twice as far.  Once that was situated it was off to T1 for our run bag drop off.  I put my Brian Dawkins jersey in the bag just in case I was feeling strong and wanted to run part of it in support of the Eagles retiring #20 that night against the Giants.


Once my transitions were set it was time to get the rest of my life situated for the race.  My girlfriend and I dropped off my friend, though not an easy task.  Found a few good places, went to the hotel, checked in, and sent out an email with the directions and locations and estimated times for people to join in the spectating of the 6(+) hour event!  By the time that was done my girlfriends parents had made it up here, we went out for dinner around 6:30 and I was back to the hotel and in bed around 8:30.  Set my alarm for 4:10am and TRIED to fall asleep.


Well, we made it with what I thought was going to be plenty of time.  Well once we got there, this is where things really started!  Like everyone else at the race, I had to use the bathroom.  The line was forever long but, no different than any other race, though this took at least a half hour.  Got my (sleeveless) wetsuit on, dropped off my morning clothes bag at the bus, second white cap age groupers 26-29.  Finally, my swim was pretty good for me.  I couldn’t see the other side of the lake when we started do to the fog from the lake being warmer than the air; my goggles fogged and swallowed water a few times.  Overall it was a 38:38.


Time for T1 and the bike.  I know my T1 times are always slow so I wasn’t concerned too much.  It was a 7:05 to take my wetsuit off, easily 30mph and may I add, FREEZING!!!!! Being soaking wet, riding 30mph, and it being 52F out...equals cold!  From there the first 20 miles were fairly flat, though a little wind.  My first 13.7 miles, average speed was 19.7mph, felt good.  From there it was a bit rough.  Though, some holes, among other things.  Split 2


Transition 2, 2:52, but this was without changing my shorts.  I normally wear underarmor shorts under my bike shorts then running shorts when I change in the transition but I was so out of it yesterday that I didn’t.  WHOOPS haha. I ran a half marathon in bike shorts, not the end of the world.  I also didn't put on my #20 Brian Dawkins Jersey, it was too hot.  Overall I did 2:16:34 for the run, which for me isn’t terrible.  My fastest half was 2:01, and even 1 year ago, felt strong, and I have never felt such a sense of accomplishment.  We’ll see what happens if I ever go for a full IM.
Today, just a little tired.  As for doing another one, I probably will, somewhere else, but we will see.  I hope everyone had a great race and a great time.  Definitely something completely different than just a half marathon or even sprint or Olympic distance tris.  Time to get training for my first full Marathon in November (in a week or so)…my next big challenge!


**TL;DR:** My overall time was 6:20:09, and run was 2:16:34.  It was cold until about half way through the bike, for me.  Ohh and it was pouring as I crossed the finish line.  Great Hilly Race!

Some brief background on myself...in April of 2010 I was rear-ended by a drunk driver. The injuries were minor but enough that I had to go to a physical therapist for back problems. I also fell into a pretty severe depression and my weight ballooned. In August of 2010, which led to jogging, then running. In November 2010, I did my first ever 5K, which led to my first half-marathon in May 2011, and through some connections and a lot of naivete, I started training for a half-iron distance tri in June 2011.

I did the Oklahoma City RedMan Triathlon in September 2011, I thought you might be interested.

I promised a race report in the weekly achievement thread and I shall deliver.

This was my first Full Ironman. I did my first half last October. My goal

If you have never done a IM before there are a few things you should know. The days leading up to race day are full with anxiety and excited anticipation. I was worried about my nutrition. I only did my first triathlon last September, I noticed that I was probably one of the few people with just a road bike, not a fancy triathlon bike with zipp wheels. I soaked in all the excitement that was in the air. 

The night before the race I sent a few hours playing some boardgames. It still didn't hit me what I was doing the next day. I went to bed around 10pm and woke up around 4am. I got to the transition at 4:30 and got my water bottles set up and made sure my transition bags were all set. I had been abstaining from coffee for 2 weeks and desperately needed the caffeine. I got some Starbucks and then walked to the swim start. 

I got into the water about 10 minutes before the start and ended up hanging on to a boat instead of treading water. When the race started it was a mad house. Even though I positioned myself in the back I was still getting hit by everyone who was wearing a wetsuit (wetsuits people started later with a 10 minute penalty). The swim was long


I got my bag and went to the tent to get ready for the long bike ride. One thing I remember was that the inside of the tent was like a sauna. Imagine 200+ guys sweating their asses off inside a giant circus tent. I really wanted to get out of there. I got on my bike and headed out of town into the country. The first 10-15miles were suburban outskirts. There was a nice tailwind pushing us into a state park in Huntsville. My nutrition plan was to drink a water bottle at each aid station and fill up my aero bottle with a energy drink at every water stop. In addition


My charlie horse from earlier in the day hadn't been bothering me at all. It must have been a miracle. I told myself to start stretching my calves as I came to the end of my ride at 3:30. The volunteers tool my bike and gave me my run transition bag. I decided to change into some compression shorts


With the charlie horse from the swim still on my mind, when I was running, all the cramps in my leg just disappeared. I looked at my watch and timed a mile. I could finish close to 15 hours at this pace, well within my goal! I as stoked. Each lap ended near the finish line where all the crowds were hanging out. There was so much excitement and energy in the air every time I came back around to that area. Towards the end of Lap 2, someone from the side shouted ""All this shit is worth it when you get to the finish line, I tell you."" There was something so sincere and candid about the way he said it. I started my last lap just as the sun was setting. During the water stops they were handing out chicken broth, which I gladly gulped down. Other than a prolonged hiccups attack at the end, while I was in high spirits. Seriously


I came up to the finish line and saw my parents and my girlfriend. After a quick kiss and some hugs I ran across the finish line. 14:40 was my time. I had fished way faster than I thought! The weird part was


[Here is me after the race with a goofy ass grin on my face](http://i.imgur.com/ABaFR.jpg)

[Here are my splits](http://i.imgur.com/L6l3e.jpg)

My problem is, or on someone's feet for that matter, I don't know how I am going to be able to tell if that's the speed I am going to want to go.

I know the simple answer to this, but if you feel overly exerted, find slower feet to draft.  But I was hoping for a couple tips or tricks you guys have used to make sure you end up drafting off the the right person or the right group once you hit the open water.

1375371446.0,1jhzlk,IMLP Race Report,jeece,17,4,6,"Hey all. Finished IMLP this past weekend. My first full distance IM. Thrilled to pieces to accomplish what I did. Feel free to ask questions if you are considering this race.

Times (rounded): Swim: 1:14 Bike: 6:27 Run: 4:27

Prep:
Logistics were terrifying, plus a Gatorade. I took a 5-hour energy at around 545, too. That's my go-to morning coffee replacement for races so I was experienced in it.
 
Swim:
Prepped wetsuit and jumped in the warmup area a few minutes early. Got a few quick drill paces in, and swam the out leg no problem. Got a little frustrated by people doing breast stroke and taking up a ton of room, but what can you do. Turned, and found a nice open space right on the cable for a few buoys on the back leg. Felt super comfortable and relaxed. Came out of the water and glanced at the clock. Quick math told me about 37 minutes for the first loop. And I wasn't at all winded. I was pretty happy, but cautious since that was faster than I have ever done a HIM swim leg. Got back in and settled right back in on the cable. Those numbered buoys are huge and I ended up crashing into them, then having to just go under a few of them. Was no big deal though, since it kept me on the cable. Came out of the water feeling fantastic. I almost wanted to do a third leg. :) Missed the clock
 
T1: A few jog steps, I have no idea if it was raining but I went into the tent and sat to change. I took my time changing, breathing, settling, even had time to make some jokes. Took a last glance around before handing my stuff ot the volunteer to re-pack. Exiting the tent, I headed around to the bikes. The caller missed my number so my bike wasn't retrieved. I had to go down my row to grabe it. Oh well. Trotted to bike out to get spinning.
 
Bike: Grueling. I got started with arm warmers in my hand. I couldn't decide how warm it was, and eventually pulled them about halfway up. I stayed steady on the first climb, and passed a few people going up. Hills don't usually bother me too much so I wasn't worried that I was going 9mph and they were going 8mph. After the first climb I tried to just relax and crank around a relaxed 85-90rpm, gearing to maintain cadence and less concerned with speed. Coasted most downhills, spinning a bit just to try to stay loose and flush lactic acid. My plan going in was to take an electrolyte bottle and a water bottle at each aid station. The perform went into my aero bottle (I started with gatorade there), with another perform in my seatpost cage. The water I used to pour on myself, refresh, sip a bit, and I was pretty sure I wasn't ""injured."" Finished the first loop and headed around for the second. I jacked up my watch
 
T2: Dropped my bike at the gate and jogged/highstepped to to bag rack. Trying to get loose and testing my knee. It wasn't too bad once the hill grinds were done so I was pretty happy with that. Grabbed my run bag and into the ten I went. Changed out
 
Run: Out the gate and down the hill. Felt surprisingly goot considering. I took off the arm warmers and stuffed them into my pocket. I had my gels on my belt and my salt tabs in my pocket. I had my hand bottle with water and my visor. I concentrated on slowing down on the downhill, plus water and ice as needed. The first out was longer than I expected. I felt great though, even though my pace was ""only"" 10min/mi. I turned around and headed back in. I had to pee about mile 6, then every 2 miles after that. That was a great sign for me, and I'd rather take the extra 15 seconds than be forced to walk from dehydration and cramping. I kept shuffling and clicking off miles. Felt really good coming up the hill back into town. Stopped at special needs for lubrication. My toes were starting to bother me, but nothing major to report. Continued on and headed back out the second loop. I tried to pick up a little, but realized I had a half marathon left. Tried to push under 10min/mi, which was a nice treat to break up all that perform and gel. Turned the first out, the emotion was awesome. Entering the oval. Amazing. I got passed by a guy finishing strong (where was that the rest of his race?). Did not care. I almost didn't want to finish because I didn't want it to be over. Almost. Crossing the finish line, probably half my size
 
 
After: I felt good. Tired. Sore. But good. We drove home Monday and I was ok the whole way. No cramping at all. My IT band was killing me
 
My next race is Nations, and slow swimming this week and early next. Then I'll start speed work during the week, with some longer stuff on weekends. I also registered for Savageman 70.0. I figure my fitness level right now is the highest it's ever been, so it's a good season for it. My last race of the season will be the Marine Corps Marathon. I kind of wanted to try to qualify for Boston, but I think this year the times for my age group will be excessively competitive. Last year, my BQ time was around 3:10.

I'm hooked! Here are some things that I've learned along the way.",nerfornothin,21,15, blogs and of course

* Bringing a 5 gallon bucket to transport your things to transition and to flip over to sit on when putting on/taking off cleats/running shoes. (Haven't mastered putting on cleats while already clipped in to the pedals)

* Baby powder on your transition mat/towel to dry your feet and get the sand off of your feet when coming from the water

* Nutrition! Even though it was a sprint

* PAM on the arms and legs to help take off the wetsuit easily. I thought it would work

I can already tell that I'm going to be competing in triathlons until I'm no longer able to physically compete. They're just too much damn fun. Every single person that I met was so nice and friendly. There were other fellow first-timers there that I connected with and we all kind of shared the same feelings and first-timer fears. That helped get rid of the jitters a lot. I have no idea why I was so afraid of open water swimming before. Aside from getting kicked in the head 3x by the guy doing breast stroke ahead of me, really cool feeling. Thanks, /r/triathlon.

I am really struggling with breathing in my freestyle swim.  I'm quite new to this stroke (always done breast stroke before I started tri training)

My issue is the exhaling.  I find it SO HARD to exhale properly under water.  Like, well trying to) my lungs are still half full, and I just end up with really shallow breath.  Then I get short of oxygen and just too out of breath to keep swimming.

I feel like I must be doing something wrong.  I tried just exhaling and letting myself sink to the bottom, but I can't seem to find a way to expel that last bit of air properly underwater.

Weirdly

I can happily swim my sprint tri distance in breaststroke

**TL;DR how the hell do you breathe out properly underwater without ending up breathless?**

I've noticed in the last several triathlons I've done your race bibs have been used for the events. I understand that my sport would basically not exist if it weren't for sponsorships, location and event logo, and as a result they're actually more interesting and meaningful to me than a t-shirt that gets worn only on weekends or silly medal. However, because the ""generic"" race bibs provide by your company contain none of this information, to me they've lost the interesting bits that made them worth keeping and showing off. If you kept your bib style exactly as it is, but moved your logo to the left (or right) and made room for the event logo with the date and location, these would once again be worth saving.

Went to bed at 8PM the night before, I'm very quick at changing them, and I had packed two spares. Got it changed, and then noticed my bike shirt was missing from the bag. It may have fallen out during my or their transport of the bag after my bike check-in, but who knows? Not much I could do about that, so I just figured I'd wear my swim skin during the bike since it was only supposed to be 77 and overcast...Also, I'd accidentally left my timex GPS/hr monitor watch on overnight

SWIM: Full mass start. Water was crystal clear. It was absolutely beautiful. I got pushed outside the main lane once or twice and got a tad off course

BIKE: Was already over 77 and really sunny, so I just went with it. The course was set up as a sort of rectangle around the southern 2/3 of the island. You started in middle of the island on the western coast, went south, turned east and road along the southern coast, and then north, turned west again and went through the citied portion. There was a southeasterly wind about ~15mph with 25 mph gusts, so it felt like a headwind for the first two portions, and then final was winding through the city, and was dumping cold water every chance I got back there

5 miles later I flatted AGAIN. I had used my last tube for the last flat, and i had forgotten i packed an extender in my bike bag. Got going again after about 30-40 min. Race was uneventful again for a while. I went through all my GU's sooner than I thought, but they had plenty at the aid stations (even if they were the horrible, awful, disgusing, chocolate PowerBar brand ones). I had some minor cramping in hip flexors, glutes, hams, so I missed out on the tailwind I was supposed to get on the last section (may not seem like a big deal

RUN:

Mostly uneventful, so that may have had something to do with it. I do know I tore up my last 10k though....passed 2 or 3 hundred people during that alone.

**Pre-race**

Having packed the bike box

I picked up the rental car that we would use for the race

I arrived on Monday afternoon so had some days to chill out with the place all to myself, I stopped on the way taking photos and taking in the breathtaking scenery, I'm ashamed to say I had never once been to Scotland, I will be revisiting for sure, it's an amazing place to visit.

After seeing the bike route, I'd never crossed a grid on my bike before and was a little cautious as to whether the side-gates would be open and manned on the day, knowing how dangerously slippery wet tram tracks can be on 23c tyres, in the end I need not have worried, as long as you hit them dead straight, held your bars a little loose and unweighted the saddle you just floated over them without issue.

With that done I chilled out and went to pickup my support crew members at the airport later in the week. We went to officially register and do the mandatory kit check and the day after had the race briefing which was very well organised and humorous; as the mic was passed over to the co-race organiser who covered the bike section his first words were ""if you get lost on the bike

I must also say a cool additional feature of the Celtman was the **[live tracking system](http://www.cxtri.com/track/)** that a bloke called Andy Upton had developed, the system was primarily for safety more than anything but it proved very useful for all the support crews to figure out when/where refuelling on the bike would take place and when their athletes would come into transition.

The night before the race my mind was racing, I wanted to try and get a good night's sleep before the race as the night before that I had only managed 5 hours, despite the black-out blinds on my room the light still managed to sneak in. In the end I think I got half an hour the night before the race, although once I got up, had a shower and put some music in my ears I was feeling positive about what was about to come...

---

**Race day morning**

I lucked out on the location of the cottage, unlike a lot of the other competitors I was able to get up a bit later.

We walked over to T1, hoping to see some other deep dish wheels, as over the days I had kept checking the weather which over the week got gradually worse in terms of wind speeds &amp; likelihood of rain.

*Side note: Unfortunately I had to pack my 60mm carbon clinchers as when I was packing my bike before travelling over a spoke spontaneously popped in my skinnier carbon clinchers when they were just resting up against the wall! The tyres had been deflated ready for packing and suddenly like a gunshot one of the front spokes just snapped :( the idiots at the bike shop must have way overtightened them when I got my bike serviced

Anyway, we set up my bucket-o-T1 with everything in, towel on top to make sure everything didn't blow out and we walked back to get me on the coach which would take us to the start of the swim.

The coach quickly filled up me semi-naked wetsuit clad people

---

**The Swim**

The organisers got us all to **[line up for a group photo](http://stevecarter.com/Celtman13/1a.jpg)**, two of the kayaks denoted the invisible start line. We all waded in, everyone in their own thoughts, I had noticed while we were waiting around that a lot of other competitors were wearing neoprene booties, one guy I got talking to had even duct-taped sealed them to his wetsuit, I was wondering if this was going to affect my swim but figured that cold feet don't really bother me at all.

I did my usual splashing water in my face routine to make my body freak-out/get used to the water temperature, ""2 minutes to race start!"" came the words from the organiser's megaphone, I tried again but my breathing wouldn't settle down, ""oh well"" I thought, ""I'll sort it on the way"", but as the race horn was sounded and the vigorous splashing got under way I found my body had calmed and I started the race without issue...

The swim as I understood had been shortened by 800m (3km instead of 3.8km), the race briefing said the local fishermen had put it between 11-13 celsius so warmer than the 10 degrees of last year but still cold!

The swim started out easy enough

During the entire day there was an ever increasingly north easterly wind which kicked up the chop each time we were out of the ""shadow"" of the 2 islands

The pack continued to spread out, I wondered if we would ever pass it!

As we finally came by it the chop settled down and the jellyfish increased in numbers, it was a nice distraction as the cold was starting to get to my right hand, which by now had turned into a kind of claw, I couldn't keep my fingers together to catch the water properly but carried on as normal, luckily I suffered no problems with muscle cramps as I had heard some people experienced last year.

As the row of little houses appeared in the distance, by now the pack either side was quite spread out as the current hit us diagonally, I figured we probably had just another kilometre or so to go.

---

**Transition 1**

Soon enough we were all pouring out the water, I was pleased to see my swim time was as I wanted (I had checked a couple of times before while I was swimming). My brother came and grabbed me and directed me to transition, my teeth started chattering a bit, I sat down opposite my bike and he ripped the wetsuit off me.

Mum handed me a lid full of warm orange... it was SO good to drink that

On went my bike jersey etc. grabbed my bike and was out quickly enough to start the bike...

1351357425.0,126g41,Realistic time frame to train for first Ironman 70.3?,danny_b87,13,1,7,"I completed my first sprint triathlon at the end of July with a time of 1:40. I loved the feeling of pushing myself to the max and applying the knowledge I am learning in school (sports nutrition major) to myself so I've decided to try and be ready for an Ironman 70.3 in a year. Specifically the Ironman 70.3 Austin


I have gotten my sprint tri time down to the low 1:20s (big part of that was getting a new/used bike). Now I am training for distance and my plan is to add a mile to my long bike and 0.25 mile to my long jog each week which would set me up to be doing 70.3 distances by the end of the summer with room for giving myself an extra week occasionally. 


My issue is that I have never jogged longer than 5 miles nonstop though have done some 6 and 7 mile runs with a jog 3 min/walk 1 min type pace. My training schedule is like this:


**Monday** - Bike to and from school 5 mi each way (10 mi  total)

**Tuesday** - Bike to and from school 5 mi each way (10 mi  total)
              Jog at night/evening my distance for that week

**Wednesday** - Bike to and from school twice 5mi each way (20mi total)

**Thursday** - Bike to and from school 5 mi each way (10 mi  total)
              Jog at night/evening my distance for that week

**Friday** - no school so long bike at the distance for the week (20 mi this week)

**Saturday** - brick run bike distance for the week (20mi) followed by jog distance for the week (4mi)

**Sunday** - rest!

Currently not swimming as my work/class hours don't coincide with open lap times at the pool but as I was able to do a comfortable 30 min mile swim by end of summer so I'm not too worried about it and I'll add that back in the spring. 

In summary is 1 year enough time to go from sprint tri to 70.3 and is a long brick run every week going to start being too much to recover from in 1 day once I get to longer distances?

1345304191.0,yfimb,Bilateral breathing and a question on pool etiquette,davidjwi,12,0,18,"Like a lot of newbie triathletes (at least those that weren't swimmers beforehand) I've been struggling with my bilateral breathing. I always favor my left side and have struggled to breathe on my right. Finally today I managed a full 50m length with bilateral breathing with a pull buoy and almost a full length bilaterally breathing without the pull buoy (more about that in a moment). 

It's been a combination of things working up to this but the main points are:

* relaxing and being comfortable in the water (this was my 4th trip to the pool in 5 days which has helped!)
* keeping my stroke long (and hence reasonably slow)
* doing lengths (with and without the pull buoy) breathing just on my ""wrong"" side (I like breathing one side up the pool
* finally, keeping head horizontal etc) and as such air just kind of trickles out of my nose. Then if there is any left before I'm due a breath I just quickly exhale it as my mouth is exiting the water. 

Hope that made sense and maybe it'll help others struggling with bilateral breathing. 

The reason I ""almost"" did 50m bilaterally without the pull buoy was that around 10m from the end I caught up with another guy in the lane and had to switch to breaststroke to avoid hitting him. I therefore had a question about lanes in the pool:

My pool usually has 4 lanes open for public swim: a slow

Unfortunately there were 3 people in the fast lane at a much much faster pace than me (they looked pretty damn pro) so I couldn't shift into that one without causing more problems. There was plenty of space in the slow lane (or the other medium lane) but he stayed in the lane, we're all there for the fun and fitness at the end of the day. 

So is there anyway to suggest him to move

Looking to qualify for XTERRA Nats this fall and am signed up for three races this summer

I have made the following adjustments to my training this year:

* More focus on the swim - As a strong cyclist, I have worked pretty hard this year to make sure I come out of the water closer to where I need to be on the bike.

* Technical bike skills.  I have a long weekend-warrior history of mountain biking, much moreso than in road tris.

* Trail running, etc would need 80-100 miles to adjust to the uneven footing.  Currently at about 100 miles of trail running for the year, with a few more trail runs in the 5-9 mile range planned before race day.

* Nutrition seems trickier.  For Oly-distance road tris I typically eat a gel before the swim, and to some extent trail running, you eat when you CAN, not when you are supposed to.  Still sort of fine tuning this.  What about aid stations?  Seems to me by necessity they would be less frequent and/or more randomly placed.  Should I carry a small water bottle on the run?  All three of my planned races have a good chance of being pretty warm.

* Any big differences in transition?  I couldn't really think of any.

* Anything else?  Helpful tips, anecdotes???

Thanks!  I'll post a race report and/or pics after my first one if you'd like.  It is XTERRA La Grande on July 20.  I'm hoping for at least a top 10 in AG finish.

I Finally got around to completing my first Half Ironman on the weekend after years of thinking about it (I ran the half marathon leg for a team in 2008 and promised myself I would come back to do the whole thing).

I am curious to find out what the readers of /r/triathlon perceive as an ""elite"" half Ironman time? 

Within running circles there is generally accepted rough or loosely defined time barriers for particular distances that are considered elite and would probably separate really good runners from excellent runners; e.g sub 30 minute 10km
What would be the Half Ironman equivalent for these times? Obviously there is a lot more variables in a half Ironman and weather conditions etc. have a much greater impact so it would be fairly ballpark. 

The times for the male pro category on the weekend ranged from 3:45 to 4:19. Would it be safe to assume something under 4:19 would be ""elite"". It's worth noting that the 3:45 winning time was the course record and all the pro category times where generally faster that the previous few years

Next time

It is important to put anti fog drops in your goggles. Couldn't see a thing. 

Next time I will wear a wetsuit. I was so cold I felt my body wasn't processing the air I was breathing in. 

How did so many people pass me on the bike? I thought it was one of my core strengths. I need to start training on the bike harder. It's not a bike ride with your girlfriend. It's a race

Next time

Sprint distance def didn't need bike shoes. Good thing too because I don't own any. But if I do a longer distance I may want to make the investment. 

Running was great. Maybe I didn't push myself hard enough during the bike

All in all it was a fun race, how the whole thing actually works, etc.). 

The biggest takeaway though I'd that if I want to do longer distances

I see why you guys are hooked. Hopefully this time next year I'll be writing about my first Olympic distance.

The swim I PR'd for pace

The bike, and then at about mile 6, turning from Lindell to Blue Bluff as I am slowing down, they guy on the mega phone says slow down, my brakes lock or I nervously squeezed to hard and my back tire went out from under me.  It all happened so fast.  I slid into the volunteers separated from my bike and managed to hop up onto my feet.  They grabbed my bicycle threw the chain back on and checked the tires setting me back on my way.  

The worse part was a lady kept telling me it was on the big ring

The run was brutal initially, just the worst cramp/side stitch I have ever had.  My personal best for 1 mile is 7:11 and my personal best 5k is 25:02, so I am quite happy with my run time.  (Happy)

First priority areas of improvement are my transitions.  I forgot a sock on the run

We both were doing the same thing and kept each other company. It was a big help having someone to talk to on the increasingly quiet run course. Passed the mile marker saying just under 3 miles left. I checked the gps and had an hour on the clock. This is going to work. I could feel cramp coming on in my calves but my walk/run strategy seemed to be keeping it at bay.

My running mate had stayed with me and as we got round the final corner we both saw the clock and realised we could make this in under 8hrs. So we ignored the pain and picked up the pace for those last few meters. I couldn't believe it

I'm prone to panic attacks to begin with, but I got in the water, started my swim and just started to feel very out of breath and panicky.  Then I got kicked in the face, which sent me into a bit of an emotional tailspin.  I had moments of thinking I was going to have to pull out and DNF.  I was going to swim to one of the paddleboarders to breathe and regroup, and he had to rescue one of the swimmers.  So I kept going and stopped at the paddleboarder at the first turn.  

He was awesome and reassuring, but after that, I couldn't get into my groove.  I ended up doing a lot of side stroke to help with the breathing, though I tried to get back to my normal freestyle.  I struggled with veering off a bit, so I just did what I had to to keep moving.

I've never done triathlon before. Or at least, the bike leg was in a carpark, and the run was out to a cone and back on the beach. 

But my gammy knee keeps being gammy when I do distance running, so I thought 'why the hell not' and signed up for a sprint triathlon (500 / 20 / 5).


I trained  any specific intent other than finishing and going hard during the race. On the day I was super nervous - but dutifully packed my gear carefully for the transitions


You've no doubt all been through this many times before but it felt very foreign yet familiar - the ritual of race pack collection, setting up transition, then out to watch the earlier waves take off, check in my bag and get ready. 


Memories from the day...

* a homeless, stinking of booze, smoking a roll-up. Just about the antithesis of the entire event. 

* dude in his 50s, everything as aerodynamic as you could possibly get, aside from the rider himself. He was easily as wide as one of his wheels. He must've killed it on the cycle leg though, it was a sweet bike. 

* got so cold waiting shirtless and shoeless for the swim to begin (just in my bathers and swim cap) that my teeth were chattering uncontrollably...getting into the water warmed me up whilst the wetsuiters were complaining about having to go in past genital depth! Hypothermia anyone??

* grinning maniacally to myself during the swim when I realised 'shit

* having trained exhaustively to breathe both sides, and had a great clear swim without having to navigate too much. Probably an extra 25 metres swum all up, and no advantage from being towed along by others, but it was a good swim regardless. 

* salt water burns the sinuses

* T1 - shoes on before overshorts  is a pretty grevious error of judgement. FFFUUUUUUUUUU....ok next time then. 

* I was riding the ONLY steel-frame flat bar bike in the entire event. Everyone passed me on the upwind legs. I mean....the dude with the prosthetic leg

* Both calves cramping uncontrollably on T2. Whilst pushing a steel framed bike. They're still sore 3 days later. 

* the camaraderie between age-groupers...joking whilst in transition, riding that looks like fun!' 'onya mate, keep it up')

* no idea of pace off the bike and through the first km of the run. Honestly

* turns out I'm a better runner than I thought - noone in my category passed me and I caught at least 10 of them up over the 5km. 

* the 'like hell you are' moment when the guy in my category who'd been pacing off me from the 3.5km mark of the run came up on my shoulder with 750 to go. I know *exactly* where you are, I ain't letting you past without a hell of a fight. Let's go then...and he dropped off! Testosterone FTW!

* the first time I've felt 'at the limit' at the end of a run. I know I couldn't have run the last 500 any faster. 

* disappointment with my time till I realised I was on race clock time but had started in the +20 minute wave. Woo hoo! 

* satisfaction and an immediate willingness to do the next one...really stoked with the event

Thank you to those that provided advice (I posted for tips earlier on), bring a hoody, bring a book'. 

So I guess that's me addicted then! Saving up for a new bike begins after Christmas...

1305646788.0,hdfga,First Triathlon Experience,SomethingSubtle,12,3,12,"I just completed my first sprint triathlon this past weekend. I played soccer in high school, I convinced myself I should try to combine them all and signed up in February.

Based on /r/triathlon's advice, the overcast quickly broke into sun during the bike and it was gorgeous the rest of the day. I really couldn't have asked for better weather.

After setting up my bike, the race conditions were a very different beast than a swimming pool.

The Swim:

So, and frothing water. My stroke was already pretty conducive to sighting, but it was also pretty good for swallowing other people's wake. Around the middle of the course when I merged with the age group ahead of the novices, I ended up having to tread water a few times to cough up the lovely lake water. The wetsuit was definitely helpful! I didn't reach a good groove until the last  ~250 meters, but was definitely beat by the time I hit the shore.

T1:

I got my wetsuit unzipped as I jogged to the transition area. I threw on a tri top and my vibram fivefingers. It took three tries to buckle my helmet due to fatigue. I grabbed my bike and got started.

The Bike:

So
 
T2:

My second transition was the quickest. I was already wearing my running shoes and could simply drop off the bike and helmet and take off.

The Run:

Unfortunately, got a good jog going, and finished with a sprint in the last .2 miles. I knew going into the race that the run was my weakest point. In retrospect, I should have practiced a lot more cycle-run bricks. It wasn't that my legs felt off. I simply didn't know how to handle the energy loss and properly pace myself.


I finished one minute under 2 hours. Under 2 hours was my upper goal.


They had a pizza coupon and a water bottle water at the end. The sun was shining and the The Lake Anna State Park was beautiful to just relax around. I cheered on some of the late finishers and eventually packed up to drive home.


I definitely enjoyed checking off the accomplishment. I'll probably do another one in the future with the lessons learned. I may try it with a real bike as well. The triathlon always seemed more appealing to me than other endurance sports due to the multiple training. I think I would get bored training for only one sport. I can only run or swim for so long.

Newbie triathlete here. I've got my first tri coming up next weekend -- [UBC Tri](http://www.rec.ubc.ca/events/triathlon/). I'm both excited and nervous as I've been training for this event since the fall. 

I have no idea what to expect, and use those to bike and run in as well? Or do I slip my bike shorts on top of the jammers?   

Or do I fork out money I don't have to get a pair of tri shorts? Do the tri shorts have the padding for your perineum? Do you use them for races only? 

I'm happy with my bike set up - 2007 Specialized Roubaix Comp. I've got the fit to a place that works well for me. The clip in pedals + shoes that I got a few weeks ago have been awesome. The bike ride is 11K - should I carry a spare tube, imo).

1376801160.0,1kl9wk,Race Report – First Tri,skot123,10,1,4,"(Sorry for the long post

I am having quite the mixture of emotions as I reflect back on today’s triathlon.

I am now a triathlon finisher! I set a PR for a sprint course.

Ultimately

On 4/23/13 I decided that I was fed up with being fat, Skot123, these are awfully specific dates and numbers… how can you be so sure? Well, me, thank you for asking. In a fit of frustration on 4/23 I started writing my weekly weight on the bathroom mirror, I also started putting an X next to the week for every workout.)

The weight has been coming off steadily. Today I tipped the scales at 244. (When I lose 5 more pounds

Last month I had a pinched nerve in my neck that sidelined me for 10 days. (I’ve had things that I’ve called a pinched nerve before… but this kicked my butt.) For the past few weeks pain killers

Fast forward to today.

I woke up about 5 hours before race start (not intentionally… just too excited to sleep). I forced myself to stay quietly in bed for a couple of more hours and got a few short naps in.

About half hour before my planned wake-up time

I had my typical breakfast

About 5 minutes later we were at the start line.

I got marked up with my race number and a giant “C”. Put the number on my bike

After what seemed like an eternity of waiting the Clydesdale and another age group wave made our way into the starting pen and eventually into the water. 

There were only about 30 people in the start wave (but someone did remark that it was always one of the biggest heats then laughed at their own pun).

On my last swim workout day

The start was far less chaotic than I had expected. There was a little bumping and jockeying for position… but not bad.

I typically site in every 6 to 9 strokes… but when I saw people swimming so wide and less swimmers than I had expected so I checked a bit more often and was right on target.

By turn one I was in about 3rd place and feeling pretty comfortable. However while turning

We caught the tail end of the wave in front just before exiting the water. I was in 5th place in my wave and top 1/3rd overall in the swim (6:54)

T1 went relatively smoothly my time was 3:26. I had wanted less than 3 minutes (I am not sure where I went long either) but I was on my bike pretty quickly.

The bike felt pretty good early (in my swim/bike practices it had taken me about 5 min to settle in on the bike).  Within the first 2 minutes of the ride I was in my top chainring and cruising. 

At 12 min into the ride I popped a salt pill.

A few moments after that I heard an ambulance approaching after it passed

As I started the decent down Duthie hill…I got up to speed

I followed the lead of the next rider in front of me and passed the cars on the right hand shoulder.

There were two ambulances on the road and a handful of riders sitting on the guardrail. I had hoped this was just a minor accident. (Apparently

I continued down the hill cruised the next few minutes of flat then started the climb. I’ve ridden this climb several times over the past few weeks and it is a tough one. I’ve timed an arbitrary 3 mile section from the base of the climb to the stop sign at the end. On 6/8 it took me 30 min

By the time I got past the top my water bottle had been dry for a few minutes…but I had an ice cold one waiting for me at the run… so I didn’t stop at the on-course water station.

I had planned on down-shifting and spinning for about ¼ mile to loosen up the legs for the run… but that didn’t happen. I just kept it in a high gear and hammered onward.

I finished the ride section at 57:46 (I was hoping for low 50s or better)… but I kept onward.

T2 felt quicker than it was 1:37… but I thought I was out of there quicker than that.

Then the “run” happened.

Sadly

I felt like crap starting the run (but that came as no surprise

I pushed forward for a few minutes despite having a cramp in my back between my shoulder blades and another brewing in the quads of both legs.

I popped another salt pill and finished my water bottle (I knew I could refill it at mile 1).

I continued at my slow trodding pace for another few hundred yards then began walking.

I started out counting paces planning on running 100 paces then walking 25.

However, or both…but there was no power coming from the engine room)

I continued this for 4.3 agonizing miles. I don’t know what percentage I walked… but it was way too much. My run time was just over an hour and this put me squarely in last place in the division.

There are a lot of things I need to improve fitness wise and I really need to work on doing regular brick workouts.

During the awards ceremony they announced that rider who had crashed was in critical condition.

I really am facing a myriad of emotions. I am proud that I finished. My transitions and swim were a bit slower than I had hoped for. My bike was several minutes slower than I had hoped… and I really just limped the run to completion.

I am debating on doing the Lake Sammamish Tri next weekend… but I’ll make a final call on that in a couple of days.

One of my goals for this season is to own up to my abilities and go for broke, but I think I have a pretty good handle on that - I have a coach, I'm very disciplined, and I love challenging training.

So I thought maybe I'd try to drop a few pounds - five, right? So since early January I've really been trying to be more conscientious about my diet. I started logging my calorie intake, trying to make better choices, cutting down on processed food. 

And I have not lost a single pound. Not a single one! I know that I have made mistakes

So now I'm really frustrated and wondering if all this is even worth the effort. Will dropping 10lbs mean cutting out all treats and goodies and eating only broccoli and chicken breasts? And will those 10lbs even matter? I want every part of my training to go toward making significant improvements. If losing weight is only going to end up saving me a couple seconds per race

Having done 2 sprints, and a HIM.  I constantly am watching Craigslist for bikes in my area out of habit, and I happened upon a local bike for a decent price (I think) that I'm contemplating to my growing (n+1) collection.

I currently have done all of my riding and tri's on a Cannondale System6 Circa 2007 (looks like this: http://www.ibikedb.net/bikes/19811-cannondale-system-6) which I put some basic aero bars on and it's been fine for me.  

So the bike I've came across locally is here:  http://cedarrapids.craigslist.org/bik/3266009250.html and it's within a 5 minute ride to go see, it appears it's actually a 2006.  Is this an upgrade for me?  Should I wait for something newer?  For it's day, this thing was pretty well equipped.

TL;DR - Is this (http://cedarrapids.craigslist.org/bik/3266009250.html) a significant upgrade from this (http://www.ibikedb.net/bikes/19811-cannondale-system-6) for Sprint/Olympic/HIM type events?

Here were three things (so far) I know I need to improve on:
- I probably wasted 30 seconds with my show laces in T2. I noticed the guys next to me had elastic shoe laces or something so they just had to pull the strap to tighten. Are these worth getting or are there better shoes for transitions?
- This Tri was my 3rd distance ride on a rode bike. Two things to note: I needed to scout out the damn mountain before the race (I signed up they day before so I had no clue what I was doing). There were times I would try to conserve energy for the next hill when it wasn't necessary. I also have no clue how to
shift properly. Is shifting something I'll just get used to over time or is it worth it to go out with a trainer for a day?
- Run faster. I crossed the finish line and knew I could have gone faster. I suppose it will just take time to get used to my body.

I'm thinking trisuit because I have a hard time finding shorts and a jersey or top that fit proportionally. I'm 6'3'' and weigh in between 180-185 lbs. My problem is that I can't find a jersey that is both snug enough but also long enough to cover my torso. My thought is that if I get a 1 piece suit I won't have to worry about my jersey riding up in the back especially during the bike portion of a race and in the front during the run. I also don't want a loose suit to create more drag during the swim.

Anyone have experience with one or both types of either kit?

Pre-race stuff. 

I'm a middle aged dude that was mildly active in my youth, I still hate it. Despite this, about nine months ago I suffered from horrid swimmers ear, and had to stop swimming. Unwilling to stop my recent rekindling of physical activity, I started running with a typical couch to 5k program. In November of 2011, our community center did an indoor tri-which I did. I used the indoor bikes to train, and finished in the middle of the pack. I had fun

So for the past 7 months since, or running 3-4 miles. It's not much, but this in combination with a vegan diet has made me lose 35 pounds. So, yay me, right? 

The Race: This is the Silverback Lawrence Triathlon, so pretty small. Far smaller than the KC tri, that's for sure. 

The night before, due to my own stupidity my alarm didn't go off. I awoke at 6:10, with just over an hour to get from the Kansas City suburbs to the the Lawrence area. Fifty minutes later, cursing and swearing the whole way, I pulled in and was able to get my bike racked with 5 minutes to spare. No coffee and no breakfast. I waited for the swim start by having a Gu packet and hoping this was enough. 

The Swim: The swim was easy. Never really done the open water swim thing, my swim was 10th overall. Sweet!  

T1: Three minutes to finish. Put on socks, consider going sockless. 

Bike: We all come to this sport with a specialty in at least one sport, you don't see the people you pass. Thus begins my tale of woe. I spent most of the bike portion watching folks pass me. I consoled myself by looking at their bikes and saying 

""Well
""Well
""Oh
""Say

Thus, thankful that the final mile or three was largely downhill. 
I finished my bike just shy of a 16mph average. 

T2: One minute and change. This was one far easier-just throw off the shoes and put on the running shoes. Done!

The Run: The run of suck. My legs were simply non-functional. I had not really trained bricks and it showed. I ran for about 3/4 of a mile, but I think if I pushed myself I would be at 28ish minutes. Thirty, tops. But here, I was just done. 

So, I think my mistake was not doing my bricks. I wish I was faster on the run and swim, but that just doesn't happen without more work. I'm not really sure how to get there, but I'm not quitting yet!",,False,self,False,t3_1iucsr

I raced a 70.3 last week. It was the first time I'd done this race with my HRM. When I set off on the bike, in fact I was happy with the effort. I should say as well it was a hilly course - some big rollers for the first 60km and then lots of steep climbing at the end.

I'm racing Lake Placid next month though, then for the next 50% I let my effort drift upwards (130-145% / 70-75%), and then I powered on the last 25% where I was comfortable with what I had left to do.

bike course was bumpy. there were holes at many parts of the course. the turns were sharp and unmarked. lots of accidents from people taking turns way to fast and a lot of gravel or the turns.  aid stations were good quality tho. bike into t2 was clean very nice.
run course was hilly. volunteers were on top of the roadway which was very helpful. aid stations every mile or so. great volunteers there as well

Background story:

Windy ass day today mixed with deciding to sleep in after a long night (I'm actually a band director, I know a nice secluded hilly area and went solo to get some laps in.

I've only been into this for 2 months, I came around a hill into a crosswind that perfectly timed it's gust and pushed my back wheel.

Bike was ok to ride, runs me off the road over the curb. Because I was mad at myself over the wreck...I proceed to chase the guy down, only to find out he lives 2 doors down. I confront him, old ass guy, and he just starts yelling at me that he just must not have seen me...but then changes his tune and starts yelling at me to get my ass off the road, and that ""the roads are for the god damn cars"". I wanted to do mean things....but left with his cursing.

Can I do anything legally to him? No cars but him around so no witnesses.

I do want to do well in the triathlons and so I do want to buy a decent bike from the off as I'm seeing it more as an investment in myself rather than just buying an expensive gadget or piece of kit.

Anyway i'll get to the point

1) How much difference will it really make having a Tri bike instead of a Road bike or an adapted Road bike? What sort of distance would it start making a significant difference

2) What key things should I be looking for in either a Road or Tri bike? Types of breaks/gears/saddle/peddles etc? I have a general idea but i dont really know specifics and what would actually be a requirement and what is just a gucci piece of kit people like to have if they have the money.

**TL;DR** I have no Tri experience and i'm thinking of entering an Ironman 70.3 or 140.6 in ~June 2012. I am a decent runner (up to about 10 miles - even in military boots and soaking wet full combats) and have a good level of all round fitness as i've been applying to join the Royal Marines Commandos. However

**Long Version**
I applied to become an officer in the Royal Marines

I have a full year in which to apply again as they only take in a small amount of officers once a year (September). I was thinking of a new challenge to aim for and as inspiration to keep my fitness improving.

My running is decent although I'm not currently running more than about 8-10 miles at a time

The problem I have is the Swimming as I'm pretty much useless at front crawl (although I can do it)

Do you guys think it would be possible to get up to IM 140.6 standard (or a 70.3) in my swimming and cycling in the time-scale I have (Race is June/July 2012). I have no previous Tri experience

How do you guys think i should attack this challenge (if it's possible)and what i should focus on?

Preview: very well organized race on a flat &amp; fast course.

**Pre-race**

For months, rules overviews, and even how to find your pictures after the race.  These emails plus their fairly active facebook page, where they were very quick to answer questions and address concerns, earned them an A+ for pre-race preparation.  Each athlete really shouldn't have any lingering questions about rules/start times/race day directives going into race morning.

And the packet pickup was also very well organized

**Race Day**

*Swim*

There was ample opportunity to warm up for the very calm lake swim.  And warm up is the right word here because the water was 86 degrees!  This was the first tri swim where I honestly thought the water was uncomfortably hot, as it allowed competitors to warm up tight up until their wave had to get to the starting line.  This was probably great for the late starters.

The swim course was put together as well as it could be too.  There must have been buoys every 50m along the 550m course, warning slower swimmers not to get up in front and inviting the sprinters to get up on the line.  Still, not everyone listened, because I, as an average swimmer found myself buzzing by/through quite a few slower guys who still thought it was a good idea to line up front and center.  This is the norm though, and I think it was better here than at the other 2 sprints I have raced.

The exit was big and easy to navigate, 
I have no complaints about it as it was spaciously laid out and gave me plenty of room to run around slower T1ers.

*Bike*

The course was laid out mostly within the park that hosted the event

Overall, but once you returned back to the race area the crowd was really great, lining up for the whole 50m chute that led up to the bike dismount area.  I should note that there were no bike aid stations, which should not come as a surprise for a 10.1 mile bike ride.  

This is also a good spot to call out the fantastic volunteers manning the transition zones.  They were extremely supportive whether you were out there for 1 or 3 hours

*Run*

The entire 5k run was contained within the park on paved trails, this was a very flat trip.  And also like the bike course, a large portion of it was shaded.  This was very welcomed on this rather hot day.  

At the turnaround point, and supportive cheers.  There was even a mister set up for anyone who want a quick shot of cool water (I did).  There were also an aid station set up mid way back, which offered water to those going in either direction.

The finish was put together like a little Ironman closing.  There was a chute set up with a long red carpet surrounded by cheering supported on either side

**Post-Race**

The food was great, potato salad, yogurt, pretzels, recovery milk, coconut water... and other things I am forgetting I'm sure.  Lets just say they were well stocked.

The race results came up wonky for a lot of people, and it led to most people clearing out by the time anybody got up to the podiums, but they ended up getting everything right in the end.  And to kill time they came out with boxes of hats and water bottles that they threw out to the crowd that was hanging around.  So they did what they could with the hand they were dealt I'd say.

**My race**

Here's the part you can skip!

* Swim - 550m, but the heat seemed to have an effect on my breathing.  I don't know why, but I really didn't hit my stride 'til the 350m marker, then I picked up the pace greatly though the close.  I missed my goal by a lot.. but it seems that a lot of people did so I am trying not to be too down on this time.  I came out in the middle of the 2nd big group I'd guess.  There were the lightning fast guys, the small first chase group, then my larger group.  I got to the front of this group in the last 100m so I could have a slightly less crowded T1.  And it was pretty empty still when I got in there.

* T1 - 2:16 - Trust me

* Bike - 10.1 mi, because the only group left in front of me were the Elites and I didn't get too see many of them on the course with their 5 minute head start!   I am using an entry level bike with upgraded wheels/tires and aero-bars with a forward facing seatpost.  I can get pretty flat with this set up.  Adding in my aero bottle and areo helmet, I think I'm almost at the limit of what I can do with this bike as far as aerodynamics are concerned.  I may get a disc cover for my back wheel before my next Half-Ironman in Sept, but then I think I'm out of things to upgrade! 

* T2 - 1:07 - Again

* Run - 5k, but the heat was pretty rough, so I'm altogether pleased with this effort.  The shade was great and the cold towels really gave me a boost at the halfway point that I hit at about 10:15 into the run.  I passed the last guy left in my AG with about 3/4 of a mile to go.  I picked up the pace a lot to get around him, probably getting down close to 6 min per mile.  I did this strategically though, not stupidly I think, haha.  I didn't want him to think he had any reason to try to keep up with me, so I went by at top speed and kept it up until we hit a windy section where he must have lost sight of me.  He tried to hold my pace for a few seconds once he saw it was between us for the group win

* Overall - 0:59:46 - This hit my goal of under an hour and was good enough for an age group win, haha.  It was also the NJ State Championship which I was not eligible for as an out-of-stater (so the state 1st place passed down to the first guy in my group from NJ), but my girlfriend came in 3rd for the state competition in her age group so overall it was a good day!

**Training**

 Like I mentioned

At this point in my season I am running between 33-45 miles per week with a 10-16 mile long run.  I am biking 100 or less miles per week with a 40-50 mile long ride (this leg has taken the biggest hit to make way for my marathon training) and I am swimming 2 times per week averaging about 2000m per workout.  I used to swim 3 times per week

I plan on stepping it up to a full Iron in 2014, as last summer I got introduced to the sports through 5ks and a sprint-tri.  I didn't start cold though, as I come from an ice-hockey heavy background.  I really love the community so far and I love seeing each workout turn into a faster time every time I've hit a course so far.  

**TL:DnR-** Hot

It was an 800m point-to-point swim course down the beach. Water temperature was 74 degrees. Very murky because it's the Long Island sound. It was also very misty to the point where you had around 300-400m visibility in the air. The sun was just a flat yellow disk in the sky. No glare or shadows cast whatsoever. The water was like glass until we started. It was a waters edge start and right off the bat I knew I was getting dropped like a rock by the good swimmers. I don't wear a wetsuit which also makes it a little harder. I swam it in a 12:34 which I found very disappointing. I'm on the high school swim team

T1 was a blunder. I attempted a flying mount on my bike, didn't matter because 200 yards later I had to stop and put on my shoes for real because I couldn't get my feet in.

The bike course was 2 loops. VERY flat for most of it with 2 small hills about midway. I thought since it was a beachside race that there would be a strong wind, after I had finished and the mist burned off). I'm a kid with an athletic build, but I carry most of my muscle mass in my legs, and my upper body is, well...kind of lacking. But this enabled me to punch it up the two hills. The first was maybe 100m long but had a grade close to if not more than 15%. The second was about 1k long with closer to a 6-7% grade. This was where I made the biggest gains on each lap. I was able to punch up both of these climbs and drop some the racers I'd been with since T1.
I completed the bike with and avg speed of 21.3 mph. So while it's not spectacular

T2 was unremarkable. Easy transition. Quick. No blunders. No traffic.

Aaaaand the run leg. My first reaction out of T2 was, so you might be able to understand why I wanted to cry when my legs wouldn't work the way I'm used to them working. I had to fight my brain to keep running when I felt like I wasn't going any faster than walking pace. 7 people passed me during the run. At 2.5k, a godsend came to me. MY LEGS STARTED COMING BACK! I was able to slowly accelerate over the next 500m until I felt I could go no faster without blowing up. I ran close to a 6:15/mile the last 2k.

I finished in 1:12:04 which earned me 2nd place in my age group and 63rd out of 550 overall.

I learned a few important things today though. First off, I learned that I need to sight better during the swim. I probably lost 30-40 seconds in the swim because I consistently deviated from the ideal route. Third, I think I should rent or purchase a wetsuit for my next event because it is Olympic distance and being a sprint swimmer, I need all the distance help I can get. Fourth, don't rush transition if it means I'll just end up stopping 10 seconds later to fix what shouldve been done right. Tri-specific shoes would help with this. Lastly, and most important, BRICKS. I need to do them a lot. I struggled off the bike and need to become accustomed to the feeling in my legs so I can run strong.

TL;DR I had a strong showing and learned valuable lessons for my next events. Great day overall",self,t5_2qhyh,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/triathlon/comments/1ib1kb/mossman_sprint_race_report/
1373361170.0,1hxbkm,Ironman Haugesund race recap - first IM,balleklorin,11,4,4,"Event link: http://ironmanhaugesund.com/ 

Pre-Race
I had never done any serious triathlons prior to this event and I was very excited. After a 8 hour drive we finally reached Haugesund late Friday. Fantastic scenery along the way and around the city made us looking forward to the cycling stage. We spent most of the day before the race to drive trough most of the cycling course. It was a lot more sharp turns than what I had expected

Race-day
Swim
I had only swam about 5 times in 2013, so I felt really ready for the next stage. 

T1
I was not sure what to wear as it was sort of cold (12C), so I ditched them. I just putted on some gloves, forced me to take an energy bar while putting on the shoes, helmet and goggles. A poor T1 time at 8:31 (mostly due to having issues with getting wet-suit off and deciding what to ride in...)

Bike
This was by far my strongest stage as I have done different long distance MTB-races before. Once allowed to jump on the bike I slipped on the pedals and fell on the seat, I did complain to them prior to the race, but they assured me everything would be ok... Turns out I need carbon paste.. Nevertheless I finished the bike ride at 2:51. 

T2: This one was done a lot quicker. It was nice and sunny so I only needed a cap and my run belt (with gels). 3~4 mins total

The Run
I had one goal - NO WALKING. I had only ran 21km once before this year at 1:57, and after 15k I felt I had no energy left. I had saved one last high energy gel which I intended to take at 18k mark, but took it now instead. I made almost an instant effect and from 16-20k was pretty nice. Last 1k was full of emotions as the 30 000 people cheering me on to the finish and I saw I just made it below my 6 hour goal - 5:57. (run time was 2:11) 

Tips to other beginners:
Take pictures of transit areas
Have an eating and drinking plan (gels/bars should be tested).
Have spare tubes (I saw many people with double flat tires)
Have an unbrako/allan key with you
Keep an eye at your HRM
Hydrate way more than you think. Dry lips are an indicator you should drink more. 
Don't be embarrassed for strange feelings when you cross the finish-line

I will definitely do it again. With seat-post in proper high I could easily shave 10-15 mins off my time

I think this is applicable to the TRI community. When you really dig in and think about what is motivating you to do that extra lap - think about whether you're doing it so the world can see you differently or so you can see the world differently.
