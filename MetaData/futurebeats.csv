To the ones that were on here before that event and are worried this subreddit will decline in quality, so I'd say that we'll definitely see more votes but not a new massive influx of tunes, and I think it's better that way.

Now


* *What on earth are Futurebeats?*

[**This post**](http://www.reddit.com/r/futurebeats/comments/kt68f/why_do_most_futurebeats_seem_to_be_downtempo/) provides some valuable insight on the matter


* *I don't see any posting rules. Are there any?*

This subreddit is all about the music. If it isn't music related in any way it will either be removed (NO MEMES. This will not become r/dubstep if I can have a word about it) or the userbase usually downvotes it to hell. Music-wise you can post almost anything. See the sidebar.

REPOSTS: We've handled reposts by not thinking about them until we hit 3


* Other stuff: I'd really **really** recommend reading through the sidebar. The community has put together some awesome posts on how to find new futurebeats and also there is the *Monthly Mix* in which I make a set out of the top-voted tunes of last month and put it up here for [**all to see**](http://www.reddit.com/r/futurebeats/comments/j8pyo/futurebeats_mixes/)!

Futurebeats has been such an amazing place for me to discover new music that I now love. I just fear that it may eventually slide into a dumping ground for every new or obscure artist instead of a community sifting out what is truly great. It is experimental music

r/futurebeats was created 3 years ago and as a timely birthday present we reached amazing 25, I've been not very active on this subreddit for a while now.. anyways, we have some long-awaited announcements to make!

The Essentials List is finished! You can admire it [**here**](http://www.reddit.com/r/futurebeats/wiki/essential_list). It's part of our wiki which we will add stuff like worthy self-posts and other resources to as well :)  
Everybody with 100 subreddit karma can edit it I believe. Add in what you consider relevant

We also added a new mod to the team! Welcome /u/biscuit484 to the team of elusive personas you could call /r/futurebeats moderators.. 

Now on to the rule rejuvenation thing: you demanded in a recent thread more hands-on moderation and clearer rules as well. We incorporated them into this handy submit page [**right here**](http://www.reddit.com/r/futurebeatstest/submit).. Hope you like them! Because you should. HARHAR

If you noticed I linked to something special, but the outcry would've been deafening supposably, so it was just easier for us to create a sample subreddit where we could try things. Once you're (mostly, can't please anyone) content with the design, we'll start implementing it here.

Phew.. what a post. But we're still not done.. I know I haven't released any new mixes lately, as I know how much you love these (me included). It's really fucking hard to find enough quality tunes for a solid mix (45+ mins), so that takes a while. Suggestions.. well, you know what to do ;)

I'm going to make myself dinner now and check up on this post in half an hour

Much love

FC

As you've maybe read in my last post

Feedback has been great

* Please post what you consider an **essential** album in the comments. 1 album per comment, more in the sense of **essential for this subreddit**.

* We will then do a survey on an external site determining which of these will make it into the list. We are leaving the decision all up to you guys

* The final list will go in to the [**Futurebeats FAQ**](http://code.reddit.com/wiki/help/faqs/futurebeats) so everybody can access it and consist of links to the albums so newbies can get acquainted with them more quickly. You'll also get a nice image consisting of the album covers which will be linked in plain sight at the header.

Another thing: I know you are all waiting for more mixes of mine.. (or any mixes at all lol) sorry I'm so slow with releasing them. I have two weekly sets on [**EMP Radio**](http://emp.cx/) where I stream my personal favourite beats and tidbits from other genres (dubstep

Thanks for listening

This could be referring to either GTA5 OR Saints Row 4

The Essentials list has been condensed into [**this image**](http://imgur.com/fMNn5), an updated ruleset etc.

Secondly, and I thinks this warrants a redesign. A lot of people don't get what the up- and downvote buttons are supposed to be (a fwd and a stop button), and some dislike the allcaps style of our font. You shall be accommodated!  
I'd also really like to have a proper submit page

Regarding the mixes.. to be honest
I'm more on a dnb and darkstep trip right now, sadly :(  
If there are any DJs out there

We have found a guy for the necessary CSS for the redesign and the sticky, there hasn't happened much here in the recent month. I'd love suggestions and critique, that would help a lot!

Keep on listening

&gt;'Future'

So how can people go around posting and acting like someone can identify what is and is not a futurebeat? Is futurebeat an actual genre that incorporates general circlejerk fodder such as chillwave/wonky/ambient/Flying Lotus, a state of mind? An ideology that each individual can posses that involves pushing or breaking the standard conventions of music in any particular genre?

To give an example, I am fully aware of the fact that people on reddit like to beat off to Frank, but that's not why I posted it. To me, ""Pilot Jones"" is a very interesting combination between standard R&amp;B sensibilities and the more experimental hip hop edge that tends to come from Odd Future members. Large, overwhelming kicks, trippy reverse synths, and a singular finger snap are the only things that accompany Frank and his many overdubs on the track, therefore

We've grown into quite a community here,000 monthly active users. We decided it was time to move forward as community and get things like an essential list of artists stickied to the top left of the page, rules posted clearly on the [submit](http://www.reddit.com/r/futurebeats/submit) page, and most obviously a graphic redesign.




We also want to find ways to encourage more community closeness here




So we want to hear what you guys have to say about the interface




In a final note, we want to make this the best place it can be and grow as we soar ever through the future.

Looking forward

MOD team
