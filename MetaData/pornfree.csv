I wasn't always like this.  Fifty days ago I was watching porn, I got disappointed in myself.  I realized I needed to quit watching porn.  

You all know how this goes.  Shortly afterward

This time

I didn't say ""I don't look at porn anymore"".  I didn't say ""I can't look at porn.""  I didn't say ""I'm not going to look at porn.""

I decided **I don't look at porn.**

Notice the language there.  

 * I am six feet one inch tall.  
 * I have brown hair.  
 * I don't look at porn.  
 * I have a small scar on my left hip.  

These are not resolutions to be made and broken

Many of us feel compelled to sexualize ourselves, and have committed suicide due to PTSD from being in porn, prostituting ourselves (porn is really not so much different, and many girls who do pornography are also ""escorts"") and becoming strippers.

Even before I ever started working in this, I hated strip clubs, I hated all of it. But if you didn't like it you just had to suck it up and deal with it. Sometimes living in masturbatory, sexless relationships with your boyfriend because he has left you for his hand and a series of images. It doesn't matter how good looking your are, and I hope the girl who wrote that understands this.

People will approach me and say well what about Youporn and places like r/gonewild?

**When you're tempted, and move on to something else. Say it aloud ""I realize that I want to look at porn, and instead I'm going to [read a book, go for a walk, play a game, call a friend, etc.]"" and then follow through.

**Don't try to avoid the addiction** - Avoiding it just means you've got to deal with it later. Deal with it as soon as you feel it coming on with the above method or whatever works for you. Ignoring it or keeping yourself busy only means it's going to strike that much harder when you've run out of things to do

**Don't become afraid of boredom** - One of the reasons I hear a lot that people relapse is due to boredom. This can lead to a fear of boredom

**When planning your day, set a goal for yourself -- something you won't regret immediately after you're finished. Something that makes you feel good, instead. Focus on that goal instead of the idea of avoiding porn. ""I'm going to clean the bathroom to surprise my wife/family, because I know it will make them proud and myself feel accomplished.""

Guys. I started pornfreee like 3 or 4 (actually much

So Im talking to you

Now here we go.

&gt;1 - **Don't start if you are not a social person at this moment.** 

This is the MOST important point. Don't fool yourself. YOU WON'T keep pornfree like without motivation. You won't keep it because you need some new drug - a girlfriend. Don't believe anything people say here, procrastinating whole days. But man, this is not the thing you can handle sitting at home. Just don't start, because two weeks won't give you result. I failed at 45th day because of this. Once I just asked my self ""why the hell I am doing this if Im not gonna get a gf with this lifestyle"". And thats how I ruined all my weeks which were hard as fuck. So DON'T start if you are currenly not doing anything in your life. This is a passive challenge which makes your social life better. You won't need a wheel if you don't drive a car.

Pornfree doesn't change your lifestyle

*Whats the best thing to do right now if you are the guy? Masturbating once a week is the best option. Scientifically proven, keep your testosterone levels high (get a beard or something) and feel stronger with it.*
&gt;2 - **BLOCK ALL THE PORN SITES AND SITES WHICH CONTAIN NUDITY/HOT CHICKS**

This is extremely important. The less you tease yourself - the stronger you feel. And no

I recommend blocking it via *hosts* file

&gt;3 - **You have to keep your activity level really high / Keep yourself tired** 

That is extremely important to sleep well. If you are not tired at the end of the day - run or make some easy pushups using your knees (not feet). The more you make - the better. The aim here is to make heart tired (not muscles) and have some nice sleeping session as a result.

&gt;4 - **Don't be an owl**

The more you keep yourself awake at night using computer

&gt;5 - **(skinny guys) Keep your stomach full**

If you are skinny like me - eat a lot and exercise. Eating makes me forget about fap completely. And I eat every 1-3 hours right now.

&gt;6 - **Fast showers** 

Do them quick like you are in army. It takes 3-5 minutes in best case. Just wash it all and you won't get a desire to touch yourself. Remember about the task - making it within 5 minutes.

&gt;7 - **Read books**

Reading books was a really new thing for me. I literally spent 3 days reading one great adventure book and I forgot about fap completely while focusing on my eyes and brain. I forgot that I've got a human body at all. So for 3 days I forgot about fap completely.

""It is perhaps only people who haven't felt the full power of sex over their logical selves who can remain uncensorious and liberally 'modern' on the subject. Philosophies of sexual liberation appeal mostly to people who don't have anything too destructive or weird that that they wish to do once they have been liberated.
However, weakens our ability to endure the kinds of suffering that are necessary for us to direct our lives properly. In particular, it reduces our capacity to tolerate those two ambiguous goods, anxiety and boredom. Our anxious moods are genuine but confused signals that something is amiss, and so they need to be listened to and patiently interpreted – which is unlikely to happen when we have to hand one of the most powerful tools of distraction ever invented. The entire internet is in a sense pornographic, it is a deliverer of constant excitement which we have no innate capacity to resist, a system which leads us down paths many of which have nothing to do with our real needs. Furthermore, the sort of creative boredom we experience in a bath or on a long train journey. It is at moments when we feel an irresistible desire to escape from ourselves that we can be sure that there is something important we need to bring to consciousness – and yet it is precisely at such pregnant moments that internet pornography has a habit of exerting its maddening pull,,month1

*written for r/pornfree*

    When even my grandmother would call her a whore
    I think it’s safe to use a word I abhor
    I invited her into my life that’s for sure
    Take a seat

    It’s now eight thirty four
    My family have all just left for the store
    And although I told her we’re finished,
    There’s pleading

    It started just over two decades before
    As a boy of eleven I’d found quite a score
    My mom’s boyfriend’s dirty magazines in a bedside drawer
    I remember a sick feeling

    I can tell you of hundreds of times I’ve tried to leave her before
    By now she doesn’t take these threats seriously.  What for?
    When I’d always come back
    I’d learned over time *I* couldn’t trust *ME* with her anymore.

    One day I felt something  new,
    Like my  once shame-sapped spirit crying out a great ROAR
    I’m not out of this fight
    I’m back in this

    I’m now sitting with a baseball bat
    With my back pressed up against the pounding and screaming at the door
    A cell phone in my hand
    It isn’t pretty

    When I ignore her no matter how she implores.

So when I'm having a very difficult time

#1: Video games. This is practically cheating. Your body assumes the same relaxed position as porn surfing, especially with faster-paced games.

#2: Housework. I have no idea why but this really, I get a little light exercise instead of sitting on my butt, and my wife is impressed... which helps with #3.

#3: Actual sex with an actual person. This is nothing like PMO at all, but I used to try to think about sex the same way I thought about the porn: a means to an end, a way to ""scratch an itch"". Without porn it's about a shared experience, a relaxing, invigorating and fun activity that brings two people closer together. If you're single, see #4.

#4: Socialize. I find myself talking with family and friends a lot more than I used to. Call someone up and get out the door; catch up over coffee with one of those people you're ""supposed to care about"" like a work friend or uncle. Being in a social setting really takes the edge off the cravings

#5: Create something. Anything. Create a post here on Reddit. (My personal fave, when I've done this, it's this completely satisfying thing that, by the time I'm done, obliterates any little craving I might have had.

1365799328.0,1c8agu,The most obvious benefits of r/pornfree,minnow1776,59,14,17,"Every person on this subreddit has his/her own reasons for taking on r/pornfree

1) **Tissue boxes last for-fucking-ever.** Before I would go through one every other week but with r/pornfree I feel like I'll never run out. Why you may ask? Because they only go on my nose

2) **You can put all that lotion to better use.** Ever had dry skin? Say no more, you can spread it all over your manly-ass biceps and make those puppies shine, or you can spread it all over a charming lady-friend (if she consents, but when she sees your sexy smooth lotion-lathered skin how could she refuse?).

3) **No more awkward dick struts to the bathroom.** You know what I'm talking about. You're sitting at your computer, hold your shirt up with your elbow, keep your spittle glazed baloney pony off your waistband with your dry hand, try to keep your not so dry hand off your favorite shirt, and you waddle your way to the bathroom to wipe your tallywhacker on some toilet paper like a constipated penguin. If you're like me, on the trip to the bathroom you're thinking, ""There's got to be a better way!"" WELL GUESS WHAT BITCH-TITS

4) **Your pets will love you more.** Is there anything worse than being in the middle of an intense and borderline painful fapfest and having your dog/cat/beloved goldfish mosey on up to you and look you dead in the eye? Maybe stepping on a lego

5) **No more embarrassing lies.** Ever walk into a respectable climate with respectable chaps and respectable ladies only to realize you have a spittle spot on your shirt, and if you haven't then you still probably have and are just lying to me/yourself. Well you can wave those situations goodbye, because from now on the stains on your clothes really will be syrup instead of dick goop.

6) **Less confusion on laundry day.** No more will you have to look at your favorite shirt and say ""Is that doughnut glaze or jizz residue?"" No more will you have to play Russian Roulette with dirty socks on your floor

7) **No more accidentally thinking about your relatives while your pants are down.** Seriously

8) **Fewer boner-alerts.** Porn addicts, and I can respect her not only for her good looks but also for her personality,"" you think ""JESUS TIT FUCK I WANNA BONE HER AND MAYBE EAT DONUTS OFF HER BUTT!"" And just like that, BAM! Instant boner-alert. Now you have to walk around holding something in front of you, or bent over at a 60 degree angle, or you have to walk behind someone large and pray that they don't stop abruptly causing you to poke them with your raging little Elvis. Take the this challenge and never compare women to ""that one porn star you saw when you were fapping on a sunny Friday afternoon alone"" and you can instead go out on that sunny Friday afternoon and see a pretty lady without instantly giving her a standing ovation in your trousers.

9) **Miscellaneous** Of course there are other things that will happen when you eliminate porn from your life, the ability to look people in the eye, a sudden power to seduce ladies left and right like you've suddenly become Antonio Benderas, fewer sexual problems like ED or impotency, spending your life living with people and pretty girls rather than fucking yourself every night til you cry your lonely ass to sleep, increased honesty and loyalty to your current or potential girlfriend/boyfriend or husband/wife, viewing women as humans rather than objects to succumb to your every whim, meaningless, she's not some beacon to chase my whole life, but all that time that you wasted being porn’s bitch has done nothing but cover a hole you were too afraid to fill yourself. I know what it is like to use pornography as a tool to lie to myself about my insecurities

So

Don't live the lie. Life is so much greater than that.

There's some porn that I'm not proud that I've seen. Some of it is truly disgusting.

I didn't want that type of imagery a part of my memory. As they say ""garbage in, garbage out""

It's a waste of time on countless levels. I have been late or close to late numerous times because of my previous porn habits. I've spent hours viewing and accomplishing nothing at all because it was pleasurable ( at the time). All of that time is lost and those memories? They're not unique in any way. They didn't make my life any richer. I didn't become a better lover as a result. 

I have skipped out on engaging socially and my habits drastically dampened my desires to seek out a mate in real life. It was an easy reward with virtually no effort. I have dealt with social anxiety for most of my life. There are no short-cuts to learning how to engage people in a meaningful way. It's normal to feel that pull to be with people.

What I hope to do is share my experience with those who are struggling and hopefully help them eradicate porn from their lives.

First off

Here are some huge things I've learned along the way.

- **Porn is a visual drug.** You all know the feeling. When you're horny

- **Your worst enemy is boredom.** One thing that kept me from looking at porn early on in my challenge was simply staying busy. No more mindless surfing late at night. Either go to bed or get stuff done. If it's during the day

- **After a while, you start to think about more important things. Porn is simply an element of the past.

- **Temptation never completely goes away.** I can proudly say that I am usually not very tempted to look at porn anymore, one day I googled an old favorite video of mine and I was a click away from relapsing. Then I shut my computer and told myself that I can't do that after coming so far. If you are ever fighting off temptation, just tell yourself ""this isn't going to be easy, but it's going to be worth it.""

- **From the outside looking in, looking at 2d images/videos of women you'll never get while you get yourself off. Then think about what you COULD be doing. You could be bettering yourself by a) having sex with real women b) forcing yourself to find women to have sex with, all while improving your game/social skills. It's no contest. WE DID NOT EVOLVE FOR MILLIONS OF YEARS TO FAP TO FAKE 2D WOMEN. Now go out there and spread your awesomeness within the gene pool.

- **You realize how strong you really are.** Remember, right? As I said, it's an addiction and commonly perpetuated by society that it's ""normal."" Think of society as a lowercase ""i"". By overcoming this common pitfall, we become the dot of the i, and the rest of society is the body of the i. Does that mean we are ""better"" than them? No, but by doing pornfree you discover your strength and you don't let porn hold you back from reaching your true potential. And that is a fantastic feeling. Once you know this, you know that porn will never control you again.

I don't think I'm better than those of you on Day 1. I have my pitfalls. Plenty of them. For over a year I couldn't make it past 2-3 weeks. You can do it. I hope this post can help those struggling. If you want any more advice on fighting this addiction PM me.

Stay strong

It's funny.. when I first heard about YBOP/NoFap a couple of months ago, wiped my internet history and swore never to look at any porn again, ever. It seemed like a laughably easy task. This NoFap business, on the other hand, this seemed like a sheer impossibility. I didn't even consider it initially until with some reasoning I concluded that it would be necessary for me to do in parallel with NoPorn.

So I went about 3 weeks without porn, I was relapsing every few days, it was insanely difficult. Fast forward several weeks and I'm 13 days fap-free, the most I've been without in 16 years. But I just now reset my porn counter to zero, having just come out of a 2-day binge and yet another hard drive cleansing. What the fuck happened? The cravings I get to fap are manageable, I can fairly easily resist and ride any waves of horniness or discomfort that seek to perturb me.

I was looking at porn since long before I even knew what fapping was. It has had a pretty profound effect on my life and needless to say, university

I had attempted to quit in the past, things gradually returned to normal for me, minus the porn. I've discovered that a day is actually longer than I had previously thought, since I'm no longer wasting 2-3 hours every day in search of the *perfect* video. 

Do I notice a profound difference in myself? Yes, but I also hated them because I thought they served no purpose other than to look pretty for us men and I felt angry because women were supposed to be there for men yet none wanted to be with me. Well, let's just say they had good reason to not be with me ;)

I'm happy to say though, but not pathologically shy. My relationships with women have improved significantly and I'm beginning to enjoy other aspects of life as well. The damage that this addiction did is quite obvious now and I have no intention whatsoever to return to it now that I've made it this far. 

I expect that as 40 days climbs to 80 days and then 160 days and then an entire year

If nothing else, but for all those around you who love you and for those who have not yet had the chance to love you. Whatever you do, don't go back. Don't retreat into the past, there's nothing but darkness there.

Here's how I see porn now. 

**It is empty.** Sex has always been the most intimate

**It is fake.** We all know that they're hired to make porn. But it's all so phony. It is not a sexual experience that involves us in any way. 

**It is watching strangers have sex.** When you stop and look it at from an outsider's perspective it's actually really creepy. Watching porn takes something that should be private

**It dulls the senses.** I know I've heard it and said it. ""Men are visual, sounds, taste, and vision. It is a complete sensory experience. And porn only focuses one one of them (I'm ignoring the fake sounds). It reinforces that we should only be using our eyes, and that's not a full way to live or enjoy sex. 

**It is dehumanizing.** They aren't women anymore. They are just body parts. It's not a healthy way to treat fellow humans. Particularly when we aspire to have/maintain healthy

1.     Porn is unfair to my time and my sense of self-worth – Simply stated, leaving me less to devote to my actual day-to-day life.  Frankly, this is unfair to me.  
2.	Porn is unfair to my girlfriend – In a few months, my girlfriend wins out every time.
3.	Porn encourages a poverty of imagination – As someone who makes his living through his creativity, relaxing appeal.  Watching an hour of bad television is more genuinely relaxing than browsing porn because it engenders a lot less guilt and shame.  This is true of basically all forms of entertainment, regardless of how intellectually stimulating.  
4.	 Freedom from porn has made sex better – Even beyond the lack of guilt and shame about masturbating shortly after sex with my girlfriend, rather than that toxic mix of anticipation and fear.  And without the fear that I wouldn’t be able to perform, sex has simply become a lot more fun for both of us.  Sex is ridiculous amounts of free fun with someone you love.  Why wouldn’t I take every opportunity to make it even better?
5.	Freedom from has also made masturbation better – Really, the trade off is clear: masturbation without porn is simply better than masturbation with porn.
6.	Porn violates all of my feminist beliefs and instincts – I know in my heart of hearts that porn is fundamentally anti-women.  Sure
7.	I cannot healthfully consume porn – Just like there are plenty of people who can drink without becoming alcoholics

like a lot of other people, since most of that revolved around alcohol, and i didn't make much effort otherwise to make friends. from this point on, i didn't really have girlfriends. i leaned on pornography to satisfy my sexual needs and to help me deal with my loneliness.

1373997023.0,1ifdwb,The real reasons I kept going to porn,New_Chapter,41,9,12,"After getting this huge wakeup call that my porn use was an addiction

A month ago

1. I have emotional pain. I felt rejected by all the girls around me in middle school and high school. There were occasions where girls made fun of me and I felt like I wasn't good enough to get a girlfriend. Not attractive enough. Not cool enough. Despite later getting girlfriends and getting married, it didn't actually fulfill me, but that's another story.)

2. I had messages

3. I was addicted because I was addicted. It was a habit. When I had the opportunity I did it without thinking about it. I craved the chemical rush. It was a fleeting pleasure

Those are the main reasons I've unearthed so far. I may find more in the future. 

Edit: 4. I realized that it was not just emotional pain from youth or simply ""stress"" that drove me to porn. It was a feeling that I couldn't have what I wanted. A few years ago it was because I wanted a promotion, a baby, and none of it was coming through. In the last few years, it was because I wanted time to write more, play video games, exercise, go on dates

I think it's telling that after I went to porn and got off

And so, while I watch it as well. There's a lot of excitement, but there's also a lot of guilt.  And the shame doesn't pass afterward, it tends to build until I've confessed my screwup to my wife and/or accountability partner.  And then I've got the consequences from my wife as well (which are not likely to help us get past this hiccup in our sex life any quicker).

There's no magic trick to stopping. There's no special software or internet filter. It's you. That's all there is. YOU are the strongest tool that you have, you'll be just as weak (to resist porn) as when you first started.

Remember, personally I keep a journal and write little reminders on post-its. and as crazy as it sounds, remind yourself audibly.

It sounds stupid but there's something powerful about the words actually coming out of your ""I'm stronger than this"" ""Is this going to be worth it"" ""Porn doesn't control me""

Porn DOES NOT control you!

You're in control. YOU decide. YOU have the power and self-control to resist.

Porn is:

1) Anything (apart from human interaction or your imagination) that you intentionally seek out for the purpose of achieving arousal

2) Anything you lose interest in after masturbating (again

3) Any sort of media that you would not mention to friends/family because of it's sexual content (eg. I wouldn't casually tell my girlfriend that I watched a video of two girls kissing)

4) Any sort of media that makes you feel like you're falling back into your old habits or any sort of media that may lead to you breaking any of the first three rules.



*EXAMPLE: Game of Thrones*

Game of thrones has a lot of sexual content

1) I don't watch GoT for arousal

2) I don't lose interest in GoT after masturbating

3) I would tell people in polite conversation that I watched GoT

4) *BUT!* All the sexual content makes me want to watch online videos of porn

Conclusion: GoT is not something I should watch.

We always talk about ""triggers"" which is a legitimate topic, there are simply TOO MANY triggers!  A hot gal on a magazine cover.  A girl jogging down the street.  A cute newscaster.  It's ridiculous.  

I've concluded that I'll NEVER be able to avoid triggers.  They will always be there.  What I've learned over the past few days is that **I HAVE TO control my mind**.  

There's no other way around this.  Whenever the slightest urge to purge hits

* While driving home, ""check out the trees blowing in the wind.  Why is it so windy today?""  Plus, I thought about other random mundane items.  It worked.

* Riding the porcelain Honda

* **10, The Beatles, Famous Athletes, Beethoven, Issac Newton, Ray Thomas, ext.) What he found was that all of these people that have achieved greatness had committed an average of 10, none of these examples started off experts in their field, Michael Jordan

* **The Breakdown**: 10, think of your dream job or dream profession whether you actually realistically ever conceived that it was something you could actually do. Now of course their is other factors like proper habits, &amp; ""deliberate practice"" that account for level of expertise certain people reach but that doesn't change the fact that their is a certain amount of hours one must invest to achieve greatness. While we practically jerked ourselves out of extinction, there were people no different than us achieving greatness with that time. 

* **Defense Mechanism**: Please don't bother playing the victim or offended ""card"" &amp; begin talking about what you have gone through or how you weren't born with the necessary ""advantages"". Take the time to really read the background stories of people who achieved greatness, that they too have risen from abusive families, that they too had lived lives no different then that of you, your friends, or your loved ones. There is no excuse to not live to your full potential my friend, it is your responsibility as someone who has the privilege of good health &amp; a working body &amp; a functioning mind to use them to their full potential because there are a lot of people out their who aren't so fortunate. So often we focus on what we don't have that we don't realize everything we do have.

Please forgive for the lack of sunshine &amp; flowers, to not only beat any and all addictions but to live like you were meant to live. Why not see what you are capable of, because I believe that you have much more potential then you could ever imagine. Scratch that, I **KNOW** that you can do more much more then you had planned.

* **The Point**: Now the point of this isn't to pile some more regret on how we've spent the past decade,000 hours we will have from never PMOing again!

&gt; Man cannot remake himself without suffering

* **What about my Needs?** You can masturbate in the future that isn't the problem, you'll be to busy being awesome, giving back &amp; being a loving partner to your significant other or future significant other. You won't find your SO in your pants you'll find her by living.

* **Get to it**: I want you to write down all the things you have ever dreamed of doing, how much money you have, what shape your in, just begin &amp; keep going because there is nothing inside of you, that makes you different from anyone else who has achieved greatness, the only difference is your **Mindset*. So get to it my friend.

Firstly, moving towards having the kind of life you want:

a) Keeping a journal.
b) Setting out your goals.
c) Getting counseling.

Keeping a journal helps to objectify your thoughts - it helps you to come to conclusions about things and clarify things in your mind. It's kind of like self-counselling - it helps you to become honest with yourself. (more on this here: http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/oliver-burkemans-blog/2013/jul/18/why-keeping-a-journal)

Writing or typing out your goals is a great way of orienting yourself away from the lifestyle you don't want (e.g. staying at home

Counselling has been great in helping me form relationships with women. I go to a female counsellor and I think that's important. Much of our porn use (or other habits we would not like to continue, that we have something to hide. Being completely honest with a female counsellor about my past and my life - it's helped me to put it into context, to realise that I'm actually a good person with things to offer etc. I'm much more relaxed and at ease with women nowadays, although I still have some way to go.

By way of illustration

I think pornfreedom is a great step in moving towards the kind of life you want because it takes you away from the computer and forces you to try to form better relationships. Personally

1) Determine a guideline for following the ""Pornfree Challenge"".  
    -  While this may seem like a no brainer it would be nice for people to understand what pornfree really is and why it differentiates from NoFap... i.e: 

A) Never watch porn.
B) When horniness is induced
C) Only masturbate when necessary to relieve yourself from potentially viewing porn and limit yourself to once a day.  As time goes on you will want to only masturbate once every two days, which builds your self control.
D) If you suffer from ED or PE
E) Whatever else we can think of that should be part of the challenge/ lifestyle

2) We should put a note in the sidebar as to why this is different than NoFap.  The lure of NoFap has differed the main reason why YBOP was so influential and turned it into a song and dance that only inhibits desires and draws the person back into porn.

These are just a few ideas that I have had because I truly am afraid that people have forgotten the true reason behind NoFap.

1355585440.0,14wa8o,Evidence of Progress,DrWolverineOBGYN,33,4,10,"I am not addicted to porn. 

Porn fucks with the way my mind works. 

I have a personality of excess. I overuse every substance or material or medium that gives me pleasure: alcohol, cocaine, ecstasy, the internet, fried foods, porn. 

They all fuck with the way my mind works. They've left me in a mental fog over the last few years-- staying out to late, lacking motivation to accomplish personal goals, seeking sexual gratification without human spirit, bleeding drying the enormous potential I possess. 

But I've begun to come around. That's the key: to make myself whole again. I can't just quit it all cold turkey. There's no reset button for me to press. I have to talk myself off the cliff--not just jump off and respawn. 

The changes I've made: 10:30 bed time and 6:30 wake up for weekdays (sticking to it 70% so far); limit junk food to 1 meal on the weekend ( 50% so far); eliminate hard drugs (so far so good); limit drinking to 2x a week (80%); eliminate porn (100% for 46 days).

The changes I still need: set a drink limit for times I do drink; set a time allowance for video games; set limits on marijuana use; find romance again. 

This is my battle to become the person I want to be. I've posted this for the calmness and clarity I feel now for spilling this out

We are victims of minds diseased by overstimulation. Tangled in a web of pleasure.

Make a plan. Begin the slow withdrawl from unfocused, apathetic, asocial avatar you are and set small, simple steps toward the you who should have always been there.

But what I've realised is: that's why I need to quit. Not because of all the reasons I had before. The fear of ED when in an erotic encounter (not a major problem but definitely a niggling fear due to past experiences); the fear that I'm an antisocial person without it; the wanting to become a better man...

These reasons aren't enough. What I realise is, that I will remain uncomfortable for the rest of my life if I abstain from porn. It will just be a period. I don't know how long this period will last for. But I have to find out. And it's kind of like procrastination... Each time I jerk off, each time I type in my regular old porn site URLs... it's just staving off the many and long moments where I feel incomplete. And it's not right to feel incomplete without porn. It means I'm missing out on all the facets of life. 

But I have to remember that abstaining is not magical. It's not some panacea for all life's problems. That's where I fell behind before. I got disappointed

But... I must find out. I must stop procrastinating. ",,t5_2rglh,False,,year1,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/pornfree/comments/14fp3o/what_ive_learned_from_returning_to_porn/

If you would have asked me a year ago if I was addicted to anything in my life – I would have said no and laughed. Addiction is related to drugs etc. The fact of the matter is I am addicted to internet pornography. I started when I was about 7-8 years old and I have continued this habit to this day. At first it was just curiosity. I remember thinking women having different parts was gross

_

I discovered hardcore sex at the age of 10. Before that time, but that faded fast as curiosity got the best of me. This continued until I was about 18 when I had my first really long term relationship. 

_

It was love first sight with this girl. She was smart, I normally didn’t have, was in me when I met her and when I asked her on a date. 

_

We started dating and enjoy each other’s company immensely. We got the same jokes
I lost my virginity to this woman. Before this I was saving for marriage like an old fashioned person, but I started watching more frequently). We even started watching it together. The sex was better than ever. We were learning from the videos on how to do new things in bed. 

_

Reality is a bitch slap in the face sometimes. I thought in my warped mind that it was ok to have a threesome with my gf if we loved each other. That was not me talking – that was my mind on porn. Of course this hurt her a lot

_

Thank God that never came to pass, but I had this other side of me that wanted to know what another girl’s vagina felt like. The threesome would have filled both needs. (SUPER SELFISH/STUPID)

_

Fast forward another year- and things just fall apart. We split up for many reasons, and didn’t know a good thing unless it hit me in the face. 

_

I always wanted to say I was sorry to the girl

_

I just recently found this subreddit and want to fix my life from porn. I took 2 1/2 years to be single and not be with anyone because I was not ready for that. Now I am getting my life back on track and ready to be a man and not dependent on smut to make myself happy or fulfilled.

_

I no longer see women as objects as I once did - there for my pleasure. The funny thing about all this is I don’t miss the sex. What I miss is the bond between a man and women that sex creates (not physically). I miss the feeling of love. I miss the little things like holding hands

_

TL:DR – I am a porn addict.

All of that is true, being offered head or a HJ or even trying to get it up to get some pussy, I've always had ED, and I've always known the reason.

I am a porn addict and have porn induced ED. This addiction has got to stop. In the past two years it has escalated to new heights with the discovery of websites and forums that share the most abuse, hiked up all the damn time to counteract the sluggish feeling after drinking and smoking and masturbating like fucking crazy.

I've kicked my other addictions. Weed, Alcohol, I went cold turkey on all of it. I lost my mind for 2 months because of the withdrawls but I got through it and am a better and stronger man for it. However, my PMO problem skyrocketed as it replaced the highs I gave away. 

My penis is near numb because I couldn't stop masturbating. When I manage to take a week off, and things will heal and I can get back to normal. But the urges are so intense. They override everything I'm thinking about. 

The thing is

During this time I had so many opportunities with women. So many. Sorority girls of all kinds

I skipped parties to have drug infused fap sessions. I cancelled plans to get hiked up on pills and weed so I can fap for hours and feel euphoria all the while. I was late to work, and again, lost so many chances with women. So instead of being the outgoing alpha male that pretty much got all he wanted handed to him that I should of been, that I've always been supposed by everyone around me to be. I've wound up a virgin loner that did a bunch of drugs, slowly stopped going out as much and became an internet junkie that spends all day on his laptop looking at women who he'll never meet, never touch and who are sucking the life out of him one wank at a time.

A few of those afore-mentioned ideal women came along, they know that you probably tug your rod too hard and long and too often to porn and that's why even while they're sucking on your cock and playing with your balls that your penis isn't even twitching. 

The story has been the same since middle school. Porn has been cock-blocking me for a decade. I have all the tools and assets

It doesn't make since to watch women getting slapped

It doesn't mesh well that you want to fall into a loving and caring relationship with a women where you both build each other up and inspire one another to be the best you can be when just two hours before you were masturbating to Sissy Hypno videos where you loudly proclaim that you're a slave to cock before switching to a video of a white woman being beaten by a black man because she likes to cry before being viciously fucked. 

The fake world of porn has been silently destroying opportunities in my life that otherwise would have led to amazing things. It's prevented me from being truly happy and helped lead me into a downward spiral into other addictions. I'm done with it as of today. The time and energy I put into addictions and PMO could have had me in a doctorate program right now, running a 4.5 40, touching rim, dating a beautiful woman, drug free and with a penis with normal sensitivity. 

I'm joining PornFree today and I'm not looking at porn ever again.

I've found this site (and NoFap) very helpful.  I'm 44.  I've been in recovery for years including SLAA
What it is is that I've been addicted to written porn (I believe this is female porn - ie adult fanfic and literotica) - for years on and off but it escalates when I'm living alone or isolated.
(I'm not talking about Fifty Shades of Grey or lame shit like that either :-)

I'm also addicted to masturbation but I've only just realised that.  I'd never heard of the word 'edging' but it totally describes what happens with erotic lit.  And I just found out from various posts here and other places that that means the dopamine levels stay up for ages.  I think this has actually become harmful to my health.

I have looked at visual/video porn occasionally but I've been so aware of how bad that can be - and harmful in so many ways - that I've managed not to go there very much.  I thought written stuff was less harmful.  Maybe it was, and then I slowly realised that those episodes were all preceded by compulsive sexual fantasy and masturbation.  This last time I've actually had serious pain in the region of my kidney / adrenals / spleen.  One night it was so bad that the next morning I went to the hospital.

I'm beginning to strongly believe it's the buildup

I can't really imagine being able to stop masturbating for days

I am pretty sure with enough prayer and writing etc I can stop going to the written porn stuff or searching stuff.  But I really don't know any women in the program I'd be comfortable talking to about this.  I have a sponsor and I mentioned it to a degree and she goes 'What's fanfiction'....uurgh!!  As if I want to tell her.  There is one close friend, who I might be able to talk to about it.

I've started writing stuff about my solo sex activities that never made it into other 4th step type things.  I'm heaps more comfortable sharing this with men than women

These days, though, many brains have trouble adapting to getting work done when they can see thousands of hot chick cooches while sitting alone, in a basement apartment

Same dynamic is in play with video games.  Video games are achievement porn for men.  Video games hijack our animal minds the exact same way porn hijacks our mating behaviors.  Video games give us all Tom Brady

Our brains are built to live in small hunter-gatherer tribes - some evolutionary change since farming - but our underlying hardware is still mostly for hunter-gatherer small tribes.  The male brain is especially designed to try and find some skill the tribe values and get good at it. People complimenting us on the mastery of that skill makes us feel good. Our brain gives us reward signals.  If you got all the positive feedback a video game gives you -- achievement points, etc, etc -- if you got all that in real life from real people then that must mean you are really awesome at something people care about it.

So all throughout my childhood I had low self-esteem and felt weak and was bullied quite often. I suppressed my feelings of inadequacy and when puberty started things went to shit.

I had been a regular user of hardcore pornography since the age of 11 and as I grew older this descended into the most disgusting things like shemale porn and ""sissy fetish"" porn. For some reason I was able to masturbate to these disgusting fucked-up fantasies and then simply snap back to my normal life when I came. This went on all through-out high school. It didn't help that I had attached myself to the lowest of the low. A bunch of self-hating losers who I called friends. They dragged me down and prevented me from doing fun things like going to parties and meeting girls.

So back in 2012

But what I can tell you is that

So now I've stopped using that utter filth. I'm still quite a heavy user of regular porn (started watching that again as a backlash) but I'm on my way to stopping. Ever since the day I triggered

I'm still suffering from depression which was triggered but I needed it. Since the trigger I have left High school

So my advice to anyone trapped watching some form of fetish porn. There's a reason you watch it. Help yourself

My next steps are to stop using pornography all together and maybe lose my virginity.

But in the early morning hours of the new year, but... NOT ONCE did I feel like looking at porn.  Instead, I wrote.  I wrote about what I was feeling, and I wrote about my future wife and how I want her to be the focus of my lust, and I wrote about my pains of the past and how I would never fall for that same mistake again.  I wrote about how exiting this feeling of lust is, I wrote about how much drive it gave me to pursue the woman of my reality, the one in real life, a fabricated dream.  

And now I feel more alive than ever before.  More exited than I ever did, all that young exited desire for toys has no comparison to the amazing.... and PURE desire that I have for that real woman.

I had been trying to quit porn for about a year, but I would have wasted hours before I would give in to my erection. I cycled like this for months.

I was the kind of person that is all suave and seductive in his mind but awkward and scared in reality. I was not bad looking and was not that awful with girls, whenever I was with my friends or at work I had this constant feeling of something was not right. This feeling I realized was elemental to my addictive mind.

I watched Your Brain on Porn. Because of the work I do and my interests I know quite a lot about neuroscience. Needless to say that guy has a point. Now consider guys like me, music, videos. It is only now I realize that I was way too much attached to my computer. I taught myself up from basic windows capabilities to basic programming, to hardware stuff, reading from online forums, trial and error, and countless hours of being one-on-one with the machine. My computer was almost alive in my eyes. What does this have to do with porn? Read on if you can.

I have seen my friends watch porn on television, but I only got stimulated from online porn. I thought deep into my addiction, I realized the good and bad memories are intermingled. I had fun with my computer when I was a kid, real fun, playing games with my buddies, being amazed by every new thing I learned online. I also noticed what psychologists call cues. If you see a box of chocolate every time you do a drug, after some time you start craving when you see a box of chocolate. With me

This made me feel bad, this is fucked up"". And yes, boy. I could not allow myself to call myself a man, cause I felt nothing like it. Not only this, I masturbated to so much inapproprite stuff, to friends I cared about, and people I respected, that I slowly and slowly started hating the act of masturbation. I had swept aside the guilt that comes with masturbation

So this is some months back, you may ask? You think you are better than the rest of us? YES, fucking YES. How? Read on, I have not told you anything yet.

I hate people. And that is where I found my turning point. Not everybody, that is different. But obsessive. I am obsessive about truth. Those of you who have seen ""Route 66"", there was one guy that is obsessive about truth. He gets mad at a beggar who holds a sign that reads ""will work for food"". He tells the beggar to clean the car for an apple, but the beggar is like wtf, asks why he can't just give him money. The guys says something to the effect of ""your sign says will work for food, there is work (pointing at the car) and there is food (showing the apple). That is how I am. Whenever someone lies, cheats I get angry. Whenever someone smiles at my face when I know inside they feel the opposite I get angry. When someone collects money for a charity and steals the money I get furious. When a friend tells me ""relax, I am no longer his friend. When people lie to themselves I try to help them out, I want to be Zen enough to not hurt anyone. If they go home and jerk-off to their crush

I finally stopped viewing porn. It was 56 days ago from today, and no. The first of the month, no. Until this exam then no more, no. All it did was give an excuse to watch porn until that time. I was just putting it off. So if you are ready, stop now. NOW, is when. And forget about it. That is who you are now, a person who does not do porn. Not someone who is pornfree for 3 days, but for as long as you exist.

Alas your body changes slowly, a life-long of natural instincts, all laid down in your foundation. Sorry but you are fighting the very person you have been all your life. It is not difficult as biologically we are made to change every second in reflection to our environment. It is difficult as you are only as strong as your will until your brain starts adapting. This means you will be fighting relapses. The thought will pop in your mind now and then. How did I fight every single one of those thoughts without cold-showers or push-ups (these are good ways to fight off an erection btw, I used them in the past) these last two months? I told myself **I will never go back to the kind of person I used to be** Never. It scares me so much I turn white at the thought of being that disgusting, no-good, pathetic boy who is afraid of life, lacking confidence and willpower to accomplish anything and bound for failure. Because yes, I do not turn on my computer unless it is absolutely necessary for work or communication. 

Sometime into Pornfree, and do other vital stuff without turning on my laptop. And I don't want to spend hours on Reddit or Youtube. I have learned a great deal on these websites, seen amazing pictures, videos, read stories that tell great life lessons. But I don't want any of it. Simple because too much time is spend looking at this LCD screen that could be spent with people, in real life, on Earth.

From now on if I want to learn something, I will spend more time for work-skills. There are people that matter to me, so I will spend time on my people-skills. 

But you said you hate lots of people? Why do you want to be a better person in a world full of despicable people? Today I am a single man but I hope to start a family down the line, studying who I am, absorbing all that into who they are. I don't want them to absorb lazy, week, dishonest-to-himself character from me. **I want my child to have an example of a successful, strong, virtuous person in his life when he looks at me

With these in mind I have not relapsed. I let go of internet addictions. I eat healthy

**The TL

**1) Do not wait for a magical day to start the change

**2) What should stop you from relapsing should not be a counter of how many days it has been. It should be that you never want to go back to the person you were

**3) Do it all for your children or other loved ones. One day your kid will look up to you and you will face questions about choices in life you made and he/she will be copying who you are growing up. Be a better original.**

**4) Do not be just pornfree, wrong friends, too much TV, anything that harms you.**

How this relates to me being pornfree is in two parts, as my pre-porn tendency to try to always be doing something is coming back. Rather than laying on the couch fantasising or hours of hunting the hottest pics, I'm trying to accomplish something with my life.

This in its self has taught me a lot. In previous pornfree streaks, the rest is up to me what I do with my improved life.

And now it's costing me time for my hobbies.  It's worse than porn getting in the way of stuff that I have to do, even more than I want porn.  C.S. Lewis said, paraphrased greatly from Screwtape Letters, that the way to destroy somebody's life is to ensure that they are doing neither what the want to do nor what they should do.  That's what porn is doing to me.

Stuff I've given up cause I abused every one of them: tobacco, benzos, z-drugs (ambien etc), hallucinogens, whatever.  4 of those 5 had serious withdrawals, two of them requiring medical intervention, one of those interventions being inpatient.  So I know about cravings and I know how strong I am capable of being if there are people around me to share the experience with. Maybe that's here.

If you're in a fight for your life

If the last five speeding dump trucks heading towards your guard post have been vbieds

Maybe it seems unreasonable to deny myself looking at women when I'm out shopping

But the people that feel that way aren't the ones who have been hit by explosion after explosion

I have been casualty free for a long time now

People lose girlfriends, jobs, self respect, self control, and sometimes even more over this stuff.  Those are some major casualties. It's addictive and sometimes people can't even trust their own minds around it. My advice is that you have to wipe out every pornographic, semi-pornographic enemy. If it looks like it might be carrying a grenade, or grow up to carry a grenade, it's the only way to be sure

That's the way I've won. I give no quarter in my mind to the enemy. ""Awww but it's just a youtube lady with low cleavage teaching math

Do you want to make it home?  Are you willing to do whatever it takes?  Then don't underestimate the enemy that you face.  Stop letting stupid things lead you into pornography's ambush. 

1) Discipline your mind.  You set out a course for your life, how are you going to be able to control yourself when you're in the thick of it?

2) Don't underestimate your enemy.  If it seems like pornography almost has a thinking, that's because it does.  Yours.  Your enemy has taken down mightier men than you.  Where they failed, you will succeed - but not if you don't fear and respect the power of pornography.  Rewatch YBOP.  

3) Fight FOR Something.  We each have our reasons.  Never forget what you're fighing for.  Imagine what success looks like and feels like.  

4) Nature Abhors a Vacuum.  What happens when you wipe out one corrupt regime?  If you do nothing, time, and motivation?  Replace the empty space with something worthwhile.  Pornography isn't our life.  It's in the way of the life we'd rather have.  If we fight only to avoid pornography, what purpose does the warrior have once it's gone?  Instead fight for something, replace pornography, and fight for the life that pornography stands in the way of.  It's an identity/perspective thing.  Our lives don't revolve around pornography, OR EVEN FIGHTING IT.  Our lives are focussed on something bigger/more than that

5) Call On Allies.  If it looks like you can't win the war alone, you'd hoped to do it on your own.  But wouldn't you rather win, even if it meant not doing it on your own?  There are professional counselors, support groups, religious groups/leaders, and our families.  A wife/girlfriend who already is aware of your problem may be the solution, not the problem.  The problem is the pornography.  Perhaps having her stand beside you while you're on patrol would be just the thing you need to keep you more alert

I have taken my own advice above, and well, and avoided pornography for so long that I consider myself ""clean"" in every way.  HOWEVER, I do believe that pornography has my number.  It has me dialed in.  If I stop being vigilant, I don't fool myself to think that it wouldn't have me again.

Will you stand with me?  No more restricted rules of engagement that makes us treat pornography with kid gloves

1346372641.0,z3wd5,Some important realizations for anyone here.,,27,2,7,"Hey guys and girls

1. **The world will not quit with you.**  The majority of the internet is pornography

2. **There are going to be times on your journey that are just going to fucking suck!** You will question whether or not its worth it. You will question why you're even doing it. You will want to go back to it. You will probably get stressed out and consider this as a healthy outlet. But you are going to have to acknowledge these feelings

3. **The world does not owe you something just because you gave up porn** If you're expecting the 90 days to come and you magically get a girlfriend or a boyfriend... Think again. It doesn't work like that. You have to get out of the house, but its only a step and it wont get you all the way to where you want to go.

4. **You can't leave here unsuccessful** If you are here, whats going to happen to your willpower if you do leave? Whats going to happen to your sense of control over your own life? RIGHT NOW you are testing the most crucial aspect of your ability to be happy. To fail that... Jeez I can't imagine going on without it. Whether you're here for 90 days or multiple years, if you've decided this is what you want, you better get it.

5. **90 days is not the end.** Even now I have urges to go back to it. I still miss it at times. But those voices are weak, and it doesn't mean you can't relapse.

6. **Its worth it!** It really is. Knowing you can control yourself,,False,,t5_2rglh,False,,True

1376676994.0,1ki3cx,My best mental trick for fighting cravings,captainpornfree,23,0,5,"Thought exercise (or written):  Consider the progression of your addiction.  Look for escalation and where you've tried unsuccessfully control it.  Now project all the way forward what will happen through the rest of your life if you continue escalating and unsuccessfully controlling it.  Given your past escalation and lack of ability to restrain it

The next part may sound dramatic

For me, and I'll ruin my ability to contribute at all to my career of choice.  My escalation will continue to where I'm perpetually lonely and existentially alone.  I'll seek out self-harming things: massage parlours, anonymous sex, prostitution, harrassment, stalking, illegal porn.  STIs and legal risk will ensue.  Eventually my actions will be impossible to hide from any friends and family I may have left.  I'll eventually be jailed and permanently marked as a sexual offender

My only option there at the end, trapped, and jailed, will be recovery or death.

But really, my addiction will fester and grow, and sooner or later I'll end up there with no choices besides recovery and death.  Only at that point so many possibilities for my future will have been eliminated.  So many bridges burnt.  It will be much harder to choose recovery, I may end up choosing death.

With this perspective

So with every craving I remind myself, leads down dark path, and is killing me.  When I'm faced with a craving, my options are **recovery or death**.  It makes it easier to choose to do that difficult thing I *know* is better for me, whatever it is.

This started to take a toll on me, and I finally took action in late September when I stumbled across /r/NoFap, and shortly read up on the subject. From there, I came to /r/PornFree, and shortly decided that this was a necessary change in my life. I officially started on the 1st of October last year, and have been thankfully clean since. 

Your mileage will certainly vary, one thing that you mustn't dwell on is the deletion of your existing collection. It has to be done immediately and without thought, otherwise you are almost guaranteed to fail. To succeed in this challenge, however, you MUST get out into the outside world and start socialising. This, along with minimising your Internet usage where possible, is key to doing well in this challenge.

If you're thinking of joining /r/PornFree, bear in mind that where /r/NoFap is a challenge with benefits, /r/PornFree is a necessary lifestyle alteration that will change you for the better. Thanks for reading my block of text, if you have any questions, feel free to ask. :)

I initially ran across /pornfree after doing a little research as a results of the Your Brain on Porn TEDx video. Previously I had never really considered a porn addiction to be a big thing, I was convinced that it would be a good idea to stop my consumption.

It may be a little TL;DR

First off, you do the math). There are likely a few reasons for this, one that I attribute to be the largest is that I have decided to not feel guilty about my habit. I accept that it was an erroneous and destructive decision to use it, but feeling guilt about it will only make it harder. The second part that I believe has really helped is that I am sexually active, and that area has had its own array of effects.

The details of my sexual activity is a story for another time and subreddit, I can simply *feel* them better. It has been a much more pleasurable experience. The downside is that I have noticed a significant decrease in the time I last (previously I lasted forever), but I am guessing this will get better once it's not such a shock to the system.

I have also noticed some immediate benefits outside of sex. For a long time I have been dealing with several issues, and what is sometimes referred to as brain fog. I have been medicated for this for a while and the medication has really helped me to be on a normalish level. After quitting porn it was same as usually for about a week, then after that I started feeling a euphoric amount of energy. It felt like I was suddenly in over drive. Since then my energy levels have been much higher, my focus is a little bit better, and more distinctively my mood is a lot better. I have also noticed a difference in how complete strangers react to me. I have always been used to some attention as I am a rather tall and athletic college student, but this past week I have noticeably been getting a lot more random people giving me the look. One day it was enough that one of my female friends commented on it. I have nothing else to attribute this to other than what quitting porn has changed in my mind, because I have literally changed nothing else in my life as of yet.

Sorry for the huge post, and it's helped with some medicated issues. At this point I have no desire to go back to porn.",,False,,t5_2rglh,False,month7,

Did I have improved erections? No doubt. Did I see women differently? Yes, to the benefits you've all heard about. 

But I just began to doubt what it meant to me. So, now that I've done it--my first relapse--now that I've caved to the pressure and got what I thought had been missing, and achieved the result, how do I feel? Like a bit of a failure. 

Maybe relapsing and seeing how unmagical it was and how icky deja vu as my mind settled back into those old deep ruts again, it seems, the answer is yes.

I'm not sure how long now it's been since I've looked at porn; probably about two weeks now. But it's been about three months since I've PMO'd

For me the problem has always been PMO. I'm not thrilled that I've looked at porn a few times in the past few months, and hopeless I felt.

To give context, at least compared to what I know some other people are into. I've tried to quit hundreds of times. The longest stretch I've ever had was 23 days, which was over last Christmas/New Year. And before that my longest was 17 days, after the prior New Year.

Looking at porn isn't a good thing, just looking is bad enough for them. I think each person identifies what their addiction is for them, and what a relapse means for them. I'm not trying to justify or rationalize anything; just explaining myself. Having said that, my goal is to not look at porn, and I've become pretty good at resisting that temptation. In all facets of this addiction, I'm taking things one step, and one day

So three months without PMO

Aside from not being super depressed for a few days, and I instigate sex, which I hardly, if ever, did before.  I haven't had any issues of ED, which I had pretty frequently before (and was always worried about in the past). One time I had ED and it was so bad, and I was so embarrassed about it, ED has a lot to do with self confidence

When I do look at porn now, and I'm certainly turned on, but it feels empty. The best way I can describe it is that I'm ""hungry."" Like I'm seeing a picture of something, but there's a big part of what it means to be sexually full, that it isn't fulfilling to me. Like I'm seeing a picture of a hamburger, and it's making me salivate, but it's not doing anything for me; I'm still hungry and the picture isn't fulfilling that need for me.

I don't really know where to start. The last few days have been the worst of my life. I feel like there's a constant weight pressing down on my chest. I can't breathe. I can barely work. Food tastes like chalk.

I am desperately in love with my boyfriend who, and when we do it's only when I initiate. I have to beg him to kiss me, to hold me, to participate in any kind of intimacy. He's been so distant, and I've been very open with him about needing to have sex more often than we are, and that having to initiate all the time makes me feel terrible. I am constantly pleasuring him, when we have sex, actually. He was always in it for my pleasure because of his low sex drive and

He revealed to me that it's been weeks and weeks since he really, multiple times a day. When I would ask him how often he would masturbate, he would flat out lie. He has some fetishes that I share, although he feels more strongly about them than I do. I have offered on multiple occasions to partake in those fetishes, to be put in positions he wants to see, etc. I have always been turned down. When I asked to see the porn that he watches, it's only of the fetish I have asked him to include me in. I feel like I've been punched in the stomach. You have a live fucking woman in front of you, and instead you watch porn. I have essentially been whoring myself out to someone who doesn't want me, though. That doesn't seem to be a fucking problem. I believe that he wouldn't ever cheat on me with another woman in real life, and all the while he was spending hundreds of dollars on porn subscriptions and art commissions.

I know the lying and the disinterest and the ridiculous spending are all signs of addiction. I understand this. My brain gets it. My brain gets that it's not about me, because this is cheating. The man that I want to spend the rest of my life with has been cheating on me multiple times a day with countless women in pictures and videos and hiding it from me. And yet I want him. When we're not together all I want is to be with him. He's sleeping on the couch and although I'm lying in bed alone, I can't even keep myself from wanting to be intimate with him. I know, though, that if he touches me even once right now I might lose it entirely. I had a panic attack at work the other night and had to leave early. It is *that bad.* I constantly feel sick and I can't finish a meal.

He gave me full access to his email, deleted his paypal, and is in the process of getting into therapy. He seems like he's willing to change, and I desperately want to help him do that, but the truth of the matter is that if I hadn't confronted him, this would have kept going on. He does not want me. He has no interest in me. To be perfectly honest, at this point I don't think he's ever wanted me in the way that I constantly want him. Even outside the bedroom he's been half-assing the relationship. It took months and even a break to get him to finally move back to be with me (I even offered to move to his city and he turned me down), and having to ask him to be romantic in any way feels to me like a slap in the face. You should not have to force your boyfriend to show you affection. In public he's all over me, but I still don't believe he wants to be with me.

We've had many long talks. He's answered every question I've asked. We've both cried a lot. I've been very clear that everything in this relationship changes or he finds somewhere else to live. He's been receptive to this and has been much more thoughtful of my needs over the past few days, not just pretend to want me. And that's hard for me, because how will I ever really know? I fear that I will always be questioning his behavior, always wondering if I really stir in him the feelings he stirs in me, always unsure in the back of my head if I'm really what he wants. I really don't know if this has done permanent damage to me and our relationship. I don't want that to be the case. We've been talking about marriage for months, and when I asked him yesterday why he would marry someone he didn't physically want, he responded with ""love."" I don't feel loved. I feel abandoned. 

I also know that it's not all about me. He has an addiction and he needs help. I *want* to help him. I love him, ask him if he's had any temptations, etc. What else can I do? So far all the changes he has made have been very positive, and I hope that it continues.

How do I help him further? How do I help our relationship and my self-esteem? We're broken.

I am so

So many days of hopelessness and despair, I never thought I would make it to 90 days, it just seemed impossible. I KNOW HOW YOU FEEL. All I can say is suck it up princess and *keep slogging on*, if I did it then you can do it. Its fucking worth it.

My major lessons:

- **Persistence** is the ONLY way to succeed in anything
- **Relapses are just learning experiences.** Every relapse I had I would learn another of my triggers or another rationalisation (meditation helps to become aware of these).
- **Edging is as bad if not worse than blowing your load to porn**
- Porn is fucking awesome, that's just WHO I DECIDED TO BE. As you start to break free, try to **forge a new identity**, tell yourself ""I'm not someone who watches porn"". SIMPLE. Doesn't leave any room for rationalisation, you don't need some elaborate reason.
- Adjusting the antenna every now and then (no fantasy


Who I was when I started:

- Wow I was a totally different person
- I was riddled with guilt and shame. I couldn't hold eye contact with people. I would be overcome with fear in basic interactions.
- Would routinely want to be swallowed into the ground.
- No idea where I was going in life.
- Dead eyes, NO ENERGY.
- Terrible memory and conversation skills.
- Social recluse with no real friends
- Would objectify every girl
- All in all it just felt like there was some fucking dark fog hanging over my life
- Feel bad --&gt; watch porn --&gt; keep feeling bad --&gt; watch more porn --&gt; DURRR Y DO I FEL BAD


Who I am now:

- Passionate about life
- Full of energy and motivation
- Deeper voice, THICK COCK
- Morning wood :D
- Can see a bigger picture of things
- Confident in social situations and talking to strangers and loved ones

THIS IS REAL LIFE.

Giving up porn gave me the strength to take on other habits which have helped drastically with my growth as a person, but my advice is start one at a time and only when you feel like you have your other habits DOWN. We only have a certain amount of willpower to use each day.

So I hope my ramblings can be of some use to you guys. I want to thank you motherfuckers for being an awesome support community

For the last year of my life, putting off this addiction, fighting pornbrain with you guys in a hardcore match of wits and brains; its made me feel, well, epic. And it will continue to give me this charge.

I don't know what to write. I don't know how to thank you. I do know one thing though, and you guys and girls, I know I can hack this. Thank you. Thank you all so much. I'm going to ramble a bit, so be warned.

About a year ago, and failed, and failed, and failed. It seemed I would never be able to get past week one. I subscribe to Art of Manliness, and they did a post on how to improve your life on reddit. They listed this subreddit, and for a while I forgot about it. I finally checked it out.... and continued to fail. Finally, I got into the swing of things about a month ago. I posted as much as I could

I started to genuinely love the people on here. I cared for you in a deep, I figured I could finally quit FOR REAL.

And I guess this is the first step to that. I beleived that strongly until I almost died (pornfree wise... :) this morning. I woke up with the strongest and worst temptations I've ever had. I got onto my computer with a half and half shot

I chose the first. I read an article about how people feel more emotion off porn

I think I got attacked so strongly by porn brain is because I'm going rafting in central Idaho till saturday. Central Idaho on the salmon river

In short, I love being pornfree, and for the first time in a very long time, I can say I love my life, and I love being me. Being off porn has helped me be more social, all of the old humor and dumb wit I loved having is returning (the puns everyone hates... awwwwww yeah!). I'm starting to have better relationships with women (and finally one in particuar isn't nearly as awkward, finally!). I feel more awake and alive! My joy is without bounds!!!

Fight on everyone. If you need anything, but I will answer!) I hope I find you all five days farther when I get back.

My problem is very much linked with a toxic relationship that has consumed the past 5 years of my life. Unfulfilled with the relationship, when away from my gf, I would spend hours browsing porn, and saving a selection. I did this at home, locked in my room. Even at college, with my roomate a few feet away. I used porn more than I masturbated. Half a year ago I hit a low point in my life and masturbated multiple times a day, always using marijuana and porn. I was a recluse, the girl too. Relapse again with all of the above.

My problem has many components. Ive recently cut off all contact with the girl

Now I need to stop looking at porn. It is too easy and too powerful. I find myself slipping back into old habits since I have so much more free time once again. I need to regain what I have lost, passion. It's not going to happen if I sit on my ass and tell myself, one more won't hurt.

1366042788.0,1cea1k,About the porn,bornagaincatholic,24,4,12,"I first experienced pornography at a very young age

To be quite honest, as I later related my understanding to my concerned and embarrassed father, the reproductive and pleasurable purpose, later still confirmed as correctly interpreted, of what I witnessed on the screen.  It stole my breath.  It made my pulse race.  Though I wouldn’t see pornography again for many years, I think that in that moment, I was hooked.

And I felt the same during my last relapse, but relapsed just over a week ago for the first time in about three months.  I felt again the thrill of the forbidden, the illicit.  The first time that is.  Having relapsed once, I consciously chose to relapse the second time in the same day.  The second time, I forced myself to take it in, so that I could remember just how boring it all felt, at least, and unexciting a presenting female really is. Well

The thing that nobody really tells you about pornography, not even self-sex.  It’s a self-reinforcing pattern of sterile self-pleasure – masturbation.  A simple outlet entirely directed towards the self.  Porn usage is little more than chasing a dopamine high at a high cost:  your self-discipline, your identity, your soul.  

When I first saw porn, but, even after marriage, and a gradually improving sex-life, my pattern of usage continued.  Usage?  No, not exactly.  The truth is that when one only thinks about chasing the dopamine high, it’s easier, than it is to go upstairs

But I’ve come to realize something.  Porn is just as much about invisibility as it is about visual stimulation.  Porn is a magic show; it’s the perfect tool to make your beloved disappear behind a computer screen.  And in so doing, for years of married life, I became a no man, a former man, an invisible man.  Porn can be a tool for making yourself disappear, as well as any mate you may have, or any potential mates.  

When I went back to the Church, because they needed something better than the “lifestyle” we were living before that.  But in the Church, I heard the message that I think I needed to hear; you, bornagaincatholic, you matter.  You’re important.  You’re loved.  Stop being a shadow of a man, and start being a man.  

To all those doing pornfree, are important.  YOU are a person.  YOU aren’t invisible, and you’re never truly going to be invisible.  So stay strong, and stop trying to make yourself disappear.  

And the person you may love is important. They aren’t invisible either, they want to be invited to return your love.  

Thanks pornfree.  Thanks to you

Disclaimer
As you read this try not to think about a white bear.

I believe a lot of our initial battle plans when starting the 90 day journey is to white knuckle it and resist the temptations

Have we stopped thinking about that white bear yet?

You see I will try and give a primitive explanation and if asked I will be glad to go more in depth. Basically when you are trying not to think of something a part of your brain developed by evolution is on the look out for any signs of this threat. Like our ancestors trying to avoid being eaten by a lion. One part of your brain is trying not to think about porn while the other part of your brain is on the look out for any dangerous temptations

Ever notice you have a harder time avoiding sweets when your on a diet

That being said I'll make it clear how to get rid of that white bear now. Just like in paradoxical intention you need to embrace the issue instead of suppressing it

1361137240.0,18pm3u,"30 Day Update: No P, M, or O",RedDutchPancakes,23,11

I am officially 30 days in with no PMO (together or separate) and thought that sharing my thoughts and experiences would be good for myself and others here as well. Over these 30 days this community has proved indelible to my success thus far and I hope that I will continue to make the right choice each day for sobriety

The last four weeks have been truly challenging but incredible; I have been a porn addict for 7 years (am currently 20 years old) and had forgotten how much enjoyment had been drained out of my life by the addiction. The first week was pretty nice but my hopes were not exactly high. The second week, and how, it is truly up to the addict (in the form of a choice) whether or not they can have the humility to accept that they, as a person, cannot beat the addiction, but that a higher moral authority is needed in order to allow the person to suffer, in order to heal. It is amazing before how much I unnecessarily struggled to try and mentally will my cravings away; it is just not how it works; instead of combating my cravings by thinking I should not have them, choose not to indulge them, I take a walk

If I can share one thing that has helped me more than any other at keeping my sobriety so far it is that key point right there: I daily must accept that I still, but that each day, when I choose long term healing over short term gratification, I am allowing *a new me* to grow, I am at my core allowing myself to change; I have realized over the last few weeks how deeply rigid I have been in my life for a long time and changing has not been easy but the fruits have been enormous so far, I will list a few:

1) Had my first date today (in over a year). I met her with a bunch of friends at a bar a few nights ago and managed to not disrespect here that night (even as I was a little bit sloshed, mind you, because I had the discipline that I never had before to not hit on her. We have plans for another very soon.

2) I have more energy and discipline in my life in general, clean, walk more, actually ENJOY my leisure time, and have become better at my studies (I am a history student).

3) The way I interact socially has changed somewhat with people that were a source of frustration in my life; I am trying to not change the people that cause me frustration, and due to the increased confidence I have because of my sobriety, was able to strike up a conversation with a guy, who invited me to a table to meet his friends, and one of his friends is the girl I took out on a date today. Funny how the confidence I have from healing translated into all of those outcomes.

4) I will finish it with this: Every day, my life is miserable. This exercise is not designed to make me feel negative, quite the contrary, it reminds me that if I choose to PMO that I do it starring the consequences in the face. It gives me joy and courage knowing that I do not need to choose that path, and reminds of the new path I go down every day.

That about does it folks. I wish every single one of you the best in achieving sobriety and will continue to frequent theses forums; I do have one quick technical question for some of the more experienced folks here. Before going on my date I wanted to see if the.. um.. ""goods"" were still working (not to O

I realize now that this was probably not wise and want some folks to speak bluntly to me. Did I reverse my progress over the last 30 days in terms of my neurochemistry? I was under the impression that sex and stimulation did not reverse the process, maybe I will wake up fine and with no concerns at all, but still.. I am a bit concerned and desire any warranted information anyone might have, even if its just a personal experience.

Problems: ED

Basically, and I read over some of my results from back then:

Occasional morning wood

August:

I was still seeing results, made it a whole 7 days without jerking off. No more craving/feeling like it was a habit to masturbate.

September: 2 weeks in I started having sex with a new girl, even if drunk. Even was able to go for round 2 SOMETIMES, but my erection wasn't as good as the first. Relapses were horrible and resulted in fapping/porn 4/5x a day.

October: Still have PE, 3x a day.

November: RESULTS!!! I relapsed the first week to porn, my erections were now pretty solid, and my PE was going away (yes, I even had PE when I masturbated). 

2nd half of November: I have never seen more results then this:
I now can fap for 10 minutes (compared to under 3) and I have no more cravings for porn. I did however, and stays that way even if I take my hand off of it for a couple seconds (something it didn't use to do). I had sex the other night, and lasted WAY longer than I used to last. (not that it was super long, but I've improved). I find girls ATTRACTIVE when I look at them. No more gay thoughts/desire for gay porn.

I'm starting another week of nofap (and obvs no porn) for the next week today.

Conclusions: Even if you relapse, adding in REDUCED fapping/minimal fapping is what helped me overcome my addiction.

Two weeks ago she asked me if I still looked at porn. I said yes. It's come up twice before in our relationship. I said I would quit. I never took it seriously. I've been using porn to masturbate for 17

I thought it was harmless. But it's not. 

I convinced myself that I never chose porn over sex. But when I chose porn, I wasn’t maintaining that connection. And then days later if I tried to initiate sex, she must have wondered where this attention was coming from and saw right through it. Or that I wasn’t even giving her attention, but still wanted on-demand sex. No wonder we weren’t having sex as much as either of us wanted. 

It’s true that I always preferred having sex to watching porn. But I let my porn habit get in the way of having sex. 

So this is where I'm at now. I destroyed all my trust and credibility. I devastated the most important person in my life. She's ready to leave me and I don't blame her. She was always there for me and I sought after thousands of other women and never cared how it would affect her. 

We're in counseling now. Within five minutes the counselor told me that twice a week for 17 years is an addiction. It was a slap to the face. 

I immediately quit and honestly haven't been tempted to look. I did have the urge to get off once.

I've become more senstitive to stories of sexual abuse
I used to shrug off stories of rape and not really engage how I felt about sexual abuse in an ethical way until I started to address the issue of porn.
It was only when I had stood far back enough from my own addiction to what is really just a form of sexual abuse
This realisation came on the last and closest call I had: I was leafing through a photography book featuring old pictures of Native Americans when I came accross a picture of a naked indian woman. Next thing I know I'm google imaging 'Native American women', it's okay, it's not porn...) it was during this search I found out that 1 in 3 Native American women are sexually assaulted in their lives, usually by non-Native American men.
It was then I realised how sexualised these women are
When we read something like this: http://rt.com/news/saudi-preacher-fine-rape-333/, of an entirely different kind than ourselves, but I think we as men especially have to address the reality of what motivates an act like this. 

So for me the thing that has affected me most isn't so much the actual phsycal act itself
What horrifies me is that, I *can* identify with the mindstate of someone who could inflict such a degree of heedless and absolute unrestrained cruelty, justified by some sense of righteous indignation. It follows the same paradigm, and if not on the same level of delusion and confusion, I'm still a human male and as such I *could* have become one who rapes and kills women, this potential was present at some point within me.

I'm also starting to realise the difference between healthy and unhealthy sex life.
IMO, but that it should just be a natural feature of the flow of life, instead of something sought after and craved like a drug.
I understand the sex drive and how powerful and persuasive it is, dynamic beings on Earth, in our power as potential society builders, can learn to integrate the sex urge into a healthy way of being, as I believe it can be under the right conditions.

As far as /r/pornfree goes, both sexes suffer from our unawareness of our sexual urges and habits.",,False,,t5_2rglh,False,month3,

1354601231.0,148zi7,Pornography's Grip on Me,timp1206,21,1,3,"   I first started watching porn when I was in the 6th grade at the young age of 12.  I have viewed porn almost every single week since that time.  For many years, I had extreme social anxiety.  “Where do I put my hand?  This is awkward.  Don’t look at that person. The person in the next car is looking at me.  Why are people looking at me?  I’m an awkward dancer.  I can’t sing.  I’m not that fast.  I’m dumb.”  This was my daily thought process for most of my adolescence.  It wasn't until I started getting sexual active that I started to see the negative results of porn addiction and social anxiety. 
	
   In the beginning of senior year, and the first time in my life I got into a relationship.  She was a great girl and really helped me explore my sexuality.  We messed around and I did everything with her from the hundreds of hours of viewing porn.  (I actually have a very funny sex story with this girl.  I’ll post it if people are interested.)   While hooking up, I would get extremely nervous.  Thoughts and panic flowed through me.  “Why wasn’t I getting an erection?!  Do I have erectile dysfunction?  Am I gay?  What's wrong with me?""  The anxiety was overwhelming.  After doing research into pornography addiction, I discovered it could lead to poor performance in the bedroom and it worse of all it causes anxiety.  I had to change.  I texted Brooke and told her I have something important to tell her.   Opening up was tough, but I told her everything.  After listening and not saying anything, Brooke says, “You know porn is not real
	
   Since that point in my life, I will sometimes trip up and relapse; however, my life as completely turned around!  I am so much happier, friendly, loving, understanding, relaxed, maintaining a healthy lifestyle, but I have a good hold on it.  I know I will always be addicted to porn and I have to constantly be conscious to avoid slipping up.  

TL;DR – Addicted to porn since 12.  Social anxiety, and anxious most of that time.  After finding r/NoFap and r/PornFree life has turned around.

1353192825.0,13dehg,My first serious attempt at quitting after 18 years of addiction ,Velocicrappper,22,2,9,"I just joined Reddit this afternoon.  Three weeks ago I had no idea what Reddit was (living under rock

I'm going to tell my story

I'm 29, have a good job, own my own home, have some toys, etc.  And I'm struggling with an addiction nobody but those who read this text know about.  I've been addicted (and will freely admit that now) to pornography for 18 years and to masturbation for even longer.  The way I view women, myself and society have been deeply scarred over the years.  I've done a good job hiding it from those people close to me over the years.  I've become an expert at it, really.  I feel like I'm two different people -- one of whom is caught in bear trap called internet pornography and wants to escape but doesn't know where to start.

Over the last two or three years I have noticed I'm starting to lose sexual desire for my wife.  We've only been married for 6 years, beautiful woman who loves me and cares deeply for me, I'd rather have sex with my hand while fantasizing about some random model.  A couple of times, I couldn't even get it up for my beautiful wife.  She just assumed it was a fluke.   

When I was in HS I assumed that my porn use and masturbation would stop when I got a girlfriend.  It didn't.  I then assumed it would stop when I started to have sex with a real girl.  It didn't.  I then assumed my problem (I was starting to wonder if I was normal at that point) would stop when I finished school and got a real job.  It didn't.  I then assumed it would stop when I got married.  It didn't.  See a pattern here?  How many New Years has YOUR secret resolution to yourself been ""stop using porn and stop jerking off?""  At least ten for me.  Ten years of saying I'm going to stop and the best I ever did was abstain for three weeks once.

My entire adult life is tainted with images and memories I don't want.  My 13-year relationship with my wife is outlasted by my relationship with pornography.  The only people who've known me longer than I've known pornography are my family and my longest best friend (none of whom know about it either!).  My christian friends and fellowship group at church have no idea what I do in my office every time I'm home alone.  My wife -- my best friend and my lover and my everything on this world has no idea what I've seen and what I've done to myself throughout the entire time she has ever known me.  Sometimes I think she knows a person that I'm not.  That if she ever knew the truth she would never forgive me -- after all

Today marks the first day of what I hope is a huge change in my life.  

NO MORE wasting time and energy to hoardes of random women on the 'net that I will never know.  
NO MORE lying to people I love about what is wrong when I am depressed and angry at myself and everyone else and everything because I used.  
NO MORE worrying if I remembered to delete my browsing history when somebody uses my computer.  
NO MORE loss of sexual appetite for my own wife because I ""used it up"" on worthless porn. 
NO MORE feelings of guilt and conviction and asking God for forgiveness after I give into temptation.
NO MORE going to bed at night feeling like I just ruined the day and just wanting to dissapear into nothing until I could have God's grace of a new day.
NO MORE looking back on yet another year past of viewing porn and wondering when I will ever stop.  If I will ever stop.  What will happen if I get caught.
NO MORE running to the computer as soon as I get alone.
NO MORE feelings of worthlessness
NO MORE wasted time
NO MORE lying to my wife about ""I hate porn it's gross!""
NO MORE having trouble with viewing women as nothing but sex objects and running home to find some pornstar who even remotely resembles the girl I just talked to so I can fantasize and jerk the gerchin again.
NO MORE! NO MORE!  NO!  I've had it!  This ends NOW.

The stories of sucess really are encouraging so if anyone has anything they want to share

I discovered this subreddit a little while ago and thought I would share how the subject of porn affects my life as a teenage girl.

The most harsh and obvious way I can express how porn affects me is that it makes me feel suicidal.
By ""makes me feel suicidal""

It makes me feel suicidal to know how difficult it will be to find a guy who doesn't like porn or use it

It makes me feel suicidal to know my guy friends, and even father use porn. To know that a man who should be either an equal, such as a classmate, or someone who has control over my life, such as a teacher, can stomach (and masturbate to) images of women being treated subhuman.

I've battled quite a few difficult things in my life

This is a highly misogynistic world. This ""Western Misogyny"" as I call it revolves around the porn culture.
I know that my value as a girl and as a woman is very small

No matter how nicely I take care of myself: wear makeup, whiten my teeth, wear nice clothes- even though I do many of these things for myself- I know I have almost no worth to men of the world.
If I meant anything, as I don't use absolutes) the use of porn would no be so prevalent.

In my opinion

To everyone who tells me to ""deal with it"" and ""put up with"" something that deeply emotionally upsets me:
Don't tell me it's ""natural."" Don't tell me it's a man's ""right"" to watch porn

Don't tell me porn isn't personal. From what I've read

And especially don't tell me porn is okay because it is fake. Those actresses are real women who were once girls like me. Many of them have serious problems that led them down the path of acting in porn. 

There have been times in my life where I have considered becoming part of pornographic material, I would occasionally starve myself), and times when I wanted to kill myself.

I may sound dramatic

I don't know if anyone will read this
If anyone wants to hear more of my point of view

I don't want to ""speak"" for other people

If you all would be interested in such viewpoints, I am more than willing to share more of my thoughts. Also, keep working on being pornfree, everyone, I truly believe your world will be better.

There is my badge. Yes, my first lasting around 73 days. I have read on here for quite a bit, and you may have seen me comment on a shit ton of posts, so yeah, I do my best to give advice, and it seems people appreciate that, so I appreciate their appreciation. Part of the reason that maybe I haven't relapsed as much as others is because of the duration. Let me explain: Many of you guys are around 20's, and even 40's, it was bad, being pretty young


I am 16. I say that sometimes here and there, but it escalated almost as bad as the rest of you, so maybe that accounts to something. I was able to stop it, I can't help but wonder if this was made even slightly easier for me because I haven't been dependent on it so much.


I was molested when I was 5 by a family relative (Yeah, this isn't some dark secret I'm spilling to you guys, it's been resolved years ago) So, I was exposed to a dark side of sexuality. Now, when only several years later I began to get hooked onto porn, that just, did not go well at all. And my addiction escalated, as well as potentially illegal stuff I won't describe. The 'dopamine haze' porn gives you helps numb emotions, much stronger, otherwise we'd be talking about a ditch or..ok I'll move on) and I have been feeling the light almost every day now (Not high or anything


Like with all 'success' stories, I suppose I'll start listing them now. First, the views on women. I felt bitter towards them, because a lot in real life, weren't the friendliest with me. I was depressed, wanted attention, and I got attention, but told I have problems, I'd be in my own. See, without porn


Other changes: So there covers my views on women, and actually am much more social than before. Even my friends are relieved, they can see it, and so could everyone else, who only saw the PMO me. They know something's better apparently in my life, and I know it too. I used to isolate myself, a natural reaction to loneliness, and it only worsens the pain. That doesn't happen to me anymore. Back to when I was molested (It wasn't a rape scenario, therapy couldn't do it


There are some other forms of progress that I can describe, I report right away). That desire and excitement to view porn? Now it's utter disgust, I almost puke at the idea. As for the other tougher troll links (Sometimes written in different languages), I can click on, not out of curiosity, but to see exactly...I guess it should be obvious but I mean, the mentality I had was different. Then I see it less than a millesecond and close out, I have been doing my best to report the occasional troll link, they were suicidal, I have convinced quite a few people (Not just girls) to not be suicidal


Oh yeah, the more physically intimate you will be as well. Yeah, that means commitment, but when you date around, instead of sleeping (With all that sexual adrenaline pumping in), if you really like the other person, then with time you will see something in them more than a cum receptacle, it seems typical to have sex on a first date, that's a problem, which doesn't come in a first date. What else has changed on my views on relationships? Yes


Most success stories would involve getting laid (I hate that term) or finding women being interested in them. That hasn't happened to me in a way. Women viewing you in public and wanting to approach, so yeah, that might help explain since I'm not even an adult yet. But yeah, I have made progression and I can say confidently I don't have an addiction anymore. Even though the badge has not been as long as others, each day is getting easier and easier. This is no longer a challenge for me, and I can actually do NoFap too. What would I describe this recovery as? NoOrgasm. That isn't to say I'm superior to others on here, no, that dopamine and sexual excitement


Thank you all for reading this, substances can be ok, if used in moderation. There is no sense of moderation with porn. Even those that use porn occasionally see much more improvement when cutting it out completely from their lives, such as better sex drive, happier emotions overall, no shame, and better social interaction. So, that it's 'sex heroin'. Can heroin be used moderately? Not that I know of. Also should mention I think some users here think that it is a heroin addiction, and you guys can be too. It took time for the addiction to develop,

I'm a very reserved guy, never felt loved, and always left out. I would find out about parties/get-togethers after pictures appeared on facebook. I would always be the one in class sitting without a partner, since luck always had it that my class sizes were odd numbers. I would be the awkward person that had to form a group of 3. There were times when I wanted to be invisible and not exist, only because I hated who I was. I didn't want to be myself. I despised reality.

That's when I discovered porn. For the first time, they weren't rejecting me. It felt good. I loved that shot of adrenaline, and the amazing feeling that came from the dopamine. It became a drug. I was hooked. 

As I grew older, that I CAN lay it off, yet I had difficulties doing so. It's been an uphill battle since then, with many defeats, yet many victories as well. This leads us to where I am at today.

I've been dating the most amazing girl I could imagine. I've gone from friend, to finally breaking out and becoming her boyfriend. We've been dating for about 8 months now. She means everything to me, and I can't imagine losing her. Likewise, I mean a lot to her, and she can't imagine what it would be like without me. 

However, ""did you ever watch porn?"" I love her so much, that I cannot lie to her. I know that I cannot lie, since she WILL find out sooner or later. So I bit the bullet, and said, ""Yes, I've watched it, and that's when I realized that I've been hiding porn under the carpet for too long. I shouldn't be looking at naked women

This raised a couple old memories of her abusive ex-boyfriend (I'm the polar opposite of him), nor will anything change. However, because of her past, she cannot instinctively believe me. 

Since yesterday, and my justification for turning to porn. But like she said, ""that doesn't make it good."" I know for a fact that she is not going to break up with me, and that she wants to help me through this. However, I don't know how to explain that quitting isn't going to be a one-time thing. She has never seen porn herself, and considers it equivalent to cheating. She is absolutely disgusted by porn, and her idea of quitting is just saying ""no."" However, no matter how much I try to explain

That's why I've made the decision. I'm not going to be wishy washy about it. I'm going to go full force, shatter any false beliefs about women, and only make me appreciate my girlfriend even more. I've set up K9 on my computer, and had her set the password.

like many of you i was first exposed to internet porn at the very beginning of puberty and it has played a detrimental role in my life ever since. my parents caught me when i was entering my teen years, right?

i was awkward around girls all through my teens, against all odds, i met a girl near the end of my teenage years. we fell in love, blah blah blah, sex ect things were peachy, i was healthy both physically and mentally. porn had all but disappeared from my life. 

we didn't see each other for a year due to some logistics regarding where our parents lived. so we did what any young in love couple does ""the long distance relationship"". it's not easy. i fell on porn hard. 

she made sacrifices to move to where i was to be with me. she loved me more then i could have imagined at the time. i was an entitled teenager(19). in reality she should have left me

my expectations of her  became warped and completely out of touch with reality. our sex life deteriorated for a few reasons

she stayed with me through thick and thin

we've been together for roughly a decade now and our sex life has its ups and downs. i think mostly because of me and porn

last fall i almost lost her. it was probably the first true suffering my spoiled first world ass has ever experienced.  

in the aftermath of what happened i came clean about my porn habit and some other personal drama from the years. ironically she doesn't believe me that porn can be addictive or all that problematic. but i know the truth. 

i've been clean for a week or more in the past and have felt better

the most powerful thing i have read here in this forum is ""I am X and I do not look at porn"" 

Ive dealt with other issues but kicking porn has been the hardest. If only i'd listened to my parents on that day in '98. 

im doing this for her and for us but above all im doing this for my self. i do not want to live life as an addict.

First of all, as I get carried away when I type these kinds of posts and reports.

After years of being addicted to porn and having it interfere in my previous relationship, and my friendships have more or less been strengthened by it. 

Since I took porn out of my life, not eating well, spending too much time on useless things, and not feeling any kind of desire and passion for anything, hobbies, career goals or women.

I quit watching porn before my family came to visit me and things have been getting better from there. I have since switched to a healthy diet, friends, roommates, and general peers. 

I still have a long way to go, follow my interests, and take better care of myself. Music means something to me again, I like to dance more, and I just feel much better about everything. For once in my life, I have hope. A hope to make myself who I want to be and to help others become better too once I can provide the example. 

I will say that I have had one slip up in this 45 day period by seeing one GW pic (the girl was actually fully clothed) but the consequences affected my Nofap streak more than here. I have since learned what triggers me and how to either avoid them or meditate through them. 

As a man with genetic depression, and happier than Wellbutrin, Zoloft or the other drugs I was cycled through.

My advice - Don't give up your journey to be porn free, or just finding new things that excite you. 

You have actively decided to become a better person by dropping the porn. We all fall, don't stop progressing! Make yourself the man or woman you want to be, not the ones society dictates to you. It is your life and choices - make them count!

Thank you for reading. Once again, whether they are on the internet or in real life. 

Good luck

Rewind to about a year and a half ago. My wife and I had our first kid. A physically and emotionally traumatic birth, we didn't have sex for around 4-5 months. Not only was she never in the mood, but when we tried, it was painful for her.

I was frustrated. I deserved sex

I would read stories on Reddit and elsewhere about couples with vigorous sex lives and be intensely jealous. That's what I want! That's what I deserve! And I invariably used that as an excuse to bury my feelings in binges of PMO.

Even when we started having sex again, and sex is an important part of marriage. Aside from physical needs, I know I derive emotional intimacy from the physical act of sex, and I felt she was denying our marriage that emotional connection. I grew more and more resentful, but kept pushing it down and hiding it.

We talked about it a couple of times, I was hurting our marriage far more than I realized.

It wasn't until I stopped watching porn (yes

1) **Sex is not some inalienable right.** It is a privilege that flows from a healthy relationship (at least, it gives you no right to be angry at that person.

This was a gradual realization over a couple of weeks, but I no longer felt entitled to release. If it happened, amazing! If not, I'll deal.

2) **My shift in thinking was so gradual I couldn't see it

Huh? I didn't think I'd been treating her any differently. In fact

But I was wrong. She is very emotionally incisive

3) **What I watched and read about others' sexual exploits became normative to my sexuality**, this friction all but disappeared.

4) **I better appreciate just how lucky I am.** My wife is amazing in many ways, or even any other flesh and blood woman could ever be. And she's all mine. =)

I'm not disagreeing with the fact that sex is important to a healthy lifestyle/relationship and that we do have desires that demand fulfillment, or selfishness, and most tragically our capacity to cause harm to others and ourselves (""I can't be expected to ignore my needs just because I'm in a relationship,"" ""I wasn't getting it at home so I went elsewhere for it,"" ""I'm only human and I can't resist temptation because of my needs,"" etc.). By declaring our sex drives as ""needs"" we give ourselves a ""get out of jail free card"" when it comes to being unfaithful to ourselves or others. Seriously, how many times have you relapsed because you ""just couldn't take it anymore, right?

I can't tell you how many times I have been unfaithful to myself and those I love because of my so called needs ""forcing"" me to watch porn so I could get my rocks off. I treat PMO as far more important than my own well being or my relationship with my girlfriend because while self-esteem and committed relationships are good and all

1373772769.0,1i98v8,My husband is a porn addict getting help. Can you guys help me out for a minute?,cindersandashes,22,5,30,"First of all

A little background. My husband of 7 years is addicted to porn. 4 years ago it came up, he's getting help, etc. He is very remorseful and truly wants to change and I believe he can. I've been going through my own healing process and trying to work through my emotions. I've gotten hung up on one issue.

Everything I have read says that porn addiction has nothing to do with the spouse/partner. Everything I've read says it has nothing to do with the attractiveness of the spouse/partner. He tells me the same thing. I really want to believe him. It just doesn't compute, the only reason you would turn that down for porn is if the girls in porn are more attractive. I know the emotional reasons why he's turned to porn. I get all the logic. But I feel so worthless, so fat, so ugly. I feel like I've been repeatedly rejected in my marriage because my looks weren't as good as the girls in the videos. It doesn't help that I'm overweight (working on it). I worry that he's just too nice of  a guy to tell me, ""Yes, they're hotter than you, and that's a part of the problem."" 

Is there anything you can tell me to help me understand that this is not about a partner's attractiveness? Any analogies? Comparisons? Links to sites that explain? Anything at all. I want our marriage to survive this and I think it's important for my healing that I try to understand

1373648371.0,1i5vvg,Six Months Pornfree!!!,cp183,23,6,8,"Back in January after reading Porned Out

I have been dealing with addictions for many years

For me, I wanted more more and then more. Being in a committed, monogamous marriage has perks but it has it's drawbacks also. Number one being that my wife wants sex less and less as the years go by. 

I found a whole new world in online

I became obsessed and preoccupied with sex. Every woman who crossed my path became a potential partner/victim for me. *I confused fantasy and reality*. I almost believed that any woman who showed me a bit of kindness or attention wanted me. 

After becoming aware of this addiction I decided that I did not want to be the person I had become. I decided to try something different.

How very tempting it is, just that close to relapsing into old behavior. When that happens I just tell myself, ""not today"" or even ""not NOW"". I don't have to give up anything for forever; that's too big for me.

Today I am learning to feel and to let the uncomfortable feelings just be. They say

I am blessed to say that I have been porn free for six months today.

1372345192.0,1h6jew,My Quitting Porn Story,QuitPorn2,21,4,9,"This is a story about how porn and masturbation nearly ruined my life.It all started with porn.

My first experience with porn was from a magazine my nanny masturbated to in front of me when I was 8 years old.I was curious and shamed to see her do that.I realized it was something taboo and from then onwards,but never realized what it meant. Well, I got addicted to the thrill and it was all fun and games till I hit puberty and discovered masturbation/fapping.I was instantly hooked and I consumed porn and masturbated copiously all through my teens.

About nine years ago, I experimented with abstaining from pornography for longer and longer periods. It worked, till I made a decision quit it completely. To my dismay, I couldn’t. Six years later I was still trying. Each time I failed myself, I could feel my low self esteem digging its roots deeper and deeper into my psyche.

Needless to day, requiring more and more bizzare scenes and niches of porn to satisfy my dulled senses. I read every book I could find on quitting, got counseling, confessed at church(yes,I was a Catholic) Masturbation and pornography became as common to me as taking a leak. Work, school, church, now where was off limits. Whenever I felt stressed or let down

When I graduated and got a fulltime job at a prestigious communications firm, I got into a relationship with a smart, funny and beautiful woman. As sex became routine for me, the true ramifications of my “porn hobby” came to light. I began to see flaws in my girlfriend whom, when I first met was one of the most attractive women I’d ever been with sexually. Little imperfections were regularly under the magnifying glass of my porn trained mind. Everything snowballed from there and before I knew it, I was in bed with another woman performing the very same acts I had viewed on some website. When I came and the exhilaration of illicit sex had passed, I felt absolutely disgusted with myself. Nevertheless

There's a quote floating out there that says “anyone who says pornography addiction does exist, come to terms with it and eliminate it from my life. I discover a I had already lost so much inside me ,that I couldn’t bear to lose those close to me by revealing my debilitating condition. I resolved that I would apply EVERYTHING I had learned in eleven years of struggling to quit in 30 days. There was no reboot, no technique, just a firm desire and a day by day mental plan that I followed.

Quitting masturbation and pornography for a lot of men, it has been one of the greatest challenges and yet one of the most fulfilling experiences of my life. Perhaps it will be the same for you.I have been porn and masturbation for four years now.I write about my process of quitting and my life as an ex porn addict at quitporngetgirls.com.

1363631811.0,1ajejv,Guide 7: The Key To Forming A Successful Habit (Belief),neverforget_311,22,6,7,"This is an important ingredient in forming a habit that I rarely see talked about. Now knowing this topic can be debatable my understanding of the subject comes from an amazing book called

* **Examples**: If you do research you will find a lot of successful athletes were not in fact prodigy in their field but normal people like you &amp; I. What made them extraordinary was a set of habits they formed to rise to the top, Jeremy Lin, Tiger Woods, ext.) Look each of their stories up &amp; see for yourself. Not only did these athletes form habits that took them to the top (intentional or unintentionally) but they all shared one similar mindset that most important mindset that is necessary to be successful with your habit, &amp; that is they **Truly Believed** that they were going to not only make it but be the best of the best! 

* **Example 2**: Tony Dungy was one of the first NFL coaches who believed in the power of habits. During his time, that's just the way it is &amp; because of that, the habits were not used to their full potential. One day Tony's son committed suicide &amp; it devastated him, he eventually came back to the field &amp; continued coaching to get his mind off the matter. After losing his son he did not falter in his beliefs, he continued believing he could turn the Buccaneers into a super bowl team. This display of leading by example, had a huge impact on the team, they came to not only see the power of belief but where shown through an admirable example. And as you could imagine things began to change. Now to wrap this up the Buccaneers did win their first Superbowl but unfortunately Tony was fired the year before they had won, as well as changing the way coaches &amp; critiques looked at football. 

* **The Four Minute Barrier**: Before 1954 know one believed a human can run a mile in under 4 minutes. To put simply Roger Bannister didn't accept this belief &amp; made it his mission to disapprove it. As you can imagine by now Roger did successfully surpass the four minute barrier but that wasn't the most amazing part of this story. After Roger surpassed the barrier a wave of people began to surpass the barrier over 20, that's what changed my friend. 

* **Belief**: Now studies show that religious followers have more success with their habits. They like to credit it to their belief in their god, the will to **Believe** is also a muscle &amp; since religious people already completely believe in something they are better trained in this skill. So if your not religious how do you learn to believe? You might even be say, ""I already do believe in myself."" but do you? If someone came to you with a time machine &amp; told you have to bet your life to see if you achieved your goal in 90 days, would you step through it? This can apply to anything you are trying to achieve, what goal in life outside of this do you strive or don't?

* **Why?**: I am not particularity religious &amp; so I am not fortunate to have that experience in truly believing in something, reading biographies of our ancestors. Did I come to realize that it does not matter what where I came from or what my talents are, or what I have done in the past. That not only can I beat this PMO addiction, but if I want to make my dreams come true, all I need to do is create a set of habits and grind away at them and believe, believe that one day I will make my dreams come true. It is not great people who achieve greatness but normal people who believe they can achieve it. 

* **I Don't Deserve It...**: I've read some terrible stories of lost on these subreddits. People who have lost years of their lives, &amp; respect. I to have have suffered lost, but lost is lost &amp; I am not here to see who has gone through the worst. If you are under the impression that you don't deserve this (consciously or subconsciously), that you don't deserve to be free of this prison I want you to do me a favor. I want you to write down all your feelings in a note, all of your experiences with PMO, all of your suffering &amp; lost that you have gone through because of your PMO addiction, all of your regret of years lost. Afterwards read it out loud over &amp; over again until your satisfied &amp; then burn it, you are here reading this guide &amp; I am here to tell you that it is BECAUSE of that **SUFFERING** that you deserve this

I also got rid of my 5TB collection of porn and the computer that hosted all that shit. I have read all the stuff on YBOP

I have cancelled my broadband internet connection at home. This still seems like a very important step. It has not stopped me from downloading porn (I have had the opportunity to borrow other peoples network connections and I have used them for downloading porn

Here's my introduction post from 3 months ago for reference:
http://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/tge4i/sick_and_tired_of_shame_27m/



My story is similar to most of you here. I became addicted to PMO early in life and I turned to it every time something seemed too hard to handle. I actually managed to quit before but stressful situations would throw me back in the hole.  


My journey to recovery actually started with tragedy.  I dropped my iPad and had to give it to a repair shop in the mall.  As I wandered around, Porn Obsession and Shame"". As I read the first chapter describing how someone lost his family and house because of his addiction I almost broke into tears. The scary thing was I could imagine myself in that guy's situation 10 years from now.  I didn't want to hit rock bottom. I needed to take action NOW. 


That's not to say I quit right away. It was a tough process and I relapsed a lot. I had to face my inner demons head on. I still face them daily but now I can mostly ignore them.  This process is different for everyone and I wanted to share my methods which I mostly got from that book. Sorry if this comes off as whoring the book but it helped me so much that I want to share it every chance I get!


**Keep a diary**

For me this served two purposes. First


**Talk to your addict**

It feels weird at first but anytime I felt the urge I would have a dialog in my diary instead. I named my addict Kid because he makes me do childish things. The most important thing here is to not censor yourself at all.  Eventually it was easy to have a two way conversation. Here's one I had while I was struggling:

&gt;Kid: You know you want to do it. Go to the bathroom and beat your cock while reading a filthy story on your iPhone.
&gt;
&gt;Me: who are you? Why do you want me to do that?  What could I possibly gain from it?
&gt;
&gt;Kid: what do you mean why? Because it feels good. And it's easier than working. You don't want to sit here and fail to solve this problem any longer. 
&gt;
&gt;Me: that's not what I want. I want to sit here and work hard. I came here to work not jerk off to porn in the bathroom. 
&gt;
&gt;Kid: it's what you want!  It's what you always want. It's what feels good.
&gt;
&gt;Me: not today. I can solve this problem without procrastinating any longer. 


**Acknowledge your triggers**

Anytime I felt like I was objectifying or starting to fantasize in a negative way I would do the beard test.  Which means rubbing the back of my hand upward across my cheek to remind myself I'm a man. Obviously this won't work for women but it can be any action as long as its not destructive. Pinching your ear would work too. The point is to acknowledge when you are triggered so you can deal with it.


**Confide in someone**

It could be a friend


I don't plan on ever watching porn again. As far as NoFap goes I'll keep it up (or down ha!) for a year. After that I can reevaluate my situation.  Hopefully once I'm at 365 days I'll come back and make another post. Until then stay strong my brothers and sisters!

Porn? It's *always* been a part of my life.  I'm 30 now, and since then it has been pretty consistent.  In fact, it's only gotten worse.

After high school, a shift in priorities to ensure I can watch porn.  Death grip leading to performance issues in real life, coupled with the exclusionary satisfaction it gave me, eventually led to shying away from meeting women and especially trying to become intimate with them.  I never fully gave up, but it's very rare for me to try to instigate any sexual contact with a woman anymore.  

I took the cowards first approach (not necessarily a bad idea, I think).  I then had a heart-to-heart with my dad, and told him that I was having problems keeping it up with the ladies, and it's been very hard on me (no pun intended), and I don't know what I'm going to do but I may need his help.  I didn't tell him I was addicted to porn, I just said I was having performance problems.  Although stunned, my dad is a good man, I just felt defeated - I brought this upon myself!

I've wallowed in the depression of it for 2 years now.  I've told a couple other people much more than I told my dad.  I've never told anybody else in my family.  Of course, broad interests and what not - let's just say I get plenty of ""Why don't you have a girlfriend?""  I view depression not as a medical problem, but as an addiction: an addiction to being sad.  Well, I was/am depressed.  I also view my porn habits as an addiction.  They say it's truly an addiction when it negatively impacts your life.  Well, we're there.

3 days ago, I KNOW this is just a shitty business model - the lawyer works for free in exchange for a hefty percentage on the settlements.  But I also know this is going to cost me over $2000 to squash.  $2000 because I drown myself in porn? That is stupid.  I'm not ok with this.  But I'm not mad at the shady lawyer or the crappy porn company, I'm mad at myself.  Luckily, I can get this taken care of outside of court and never have my name released if I play it correctly.  But rather than downplay the seriousness of the situation just because I can make it go away, I must acknowledge it.  My addiction to porn is **negatively** impacting my life.  

I'm a smart man (pardon my horn-tooting), depression, etc.  I minored in psychology in college, which, although nothing special, at least gives me a solid footing on the ideas and terminology involved.  I tried therapy at one point - I don't like therapy.  Well, it's probably good for others, don't you do it too.""  I hate porn, but a orgasm you give yourself is nothing like an orgasm you have with someone else""

Ok

Simple.  **STOP LOOKING AT PORN**.  Cold turkey.  Done.  I'm not going to debate it, I'm not going to pretend I'm not cheating by looking at less sexual images for sexual gratification.  Just. Stop.   In fact, I'm 3 days in.  The second I read that letter I knew it was time.  I don't need a buddy, I don't need a therapist, I don't need a program.  I remember I once, maybe 5 years ago tried to just slowly decrease the amount of porn I watched - what an epic failure!  I'm just done with it.  **If** I do lapse, I start again the second the lapse is over.  This is all non-negotiable.  People always talk about strategies, but the only thing that matters is that you don't watch porn.  I'm taking the most direct route.

Of course, been very tossy-turny.  I definitely have more energy, even though I'm sleeping less.  I haven't increased my intake of any drugs or alcohol, but I do smoke weed fairly regularly and that's been nice for the irritability.  Going to bed has been tough!  But these are all just signs of a good thing.  They say ""Pain is weakness leaving your body"".  Well, I say ""Withdrawal is addiction leaving your body"".  Goodbye, porn addiction.",,,,

I used to turn to porn anytime I felt down, no matter how tiny it was. Like a lot of people here I started at an early age of 14 since the first family computer. I'm now 26 and have been viewing porn consistently since. My taste started out very innocent with stills of topless women. But as the years went on, and thanks to tube sites my tastes grew more and more disgusting.

I have a very beautiful girlfriend and been together for five years. She knows only a little of my addiction and I really don't want to lose her. Recently our sex life has been in a major drought and when we did have sex

As I said at the start

After laying in bed and thinking for most of the night I have decided today is going to be the day I will stop this addiction. I will take this recent relapse and experience and use it to my advantage. I decided to face my problems head on without porn and when I feel like I have an urge

I'm very thankful for the support here and it will make the road to recovery much easier.

Be strong my brothers and sisters! We can do this!

- We don't want to shame any of those who give in

vs

- We should keep our competitive spirit

So, and any changes that you would like to suggest.

Just like in Norse mythology, and Asgard. Midgard is the world in-between, Helheim is the underworld, and Asgard is the home of the gods. Following the traditions of Dante's ""Inferno,"" both Asgard and Helheim will be divided into 9 circles.

The game will be open to recruits on the first &amp; last day of each month. Competitors start in Midgard. If they complete the entire month without watching porn, you will be pulled all the way down to the first circle of Helheim.

Those who have failed once during any month (read: those who are in the first level of Helheim.) Have a chance to get back to Midgard if they stay clean until the end of the month. If not

Those who reach the 9th circle of Asgard will reach Valhalla

Obviously, and keep on helping those who fail.

If the game is accepted, separate the members into the categories of where they are in the game, and write a detailed post about the rules - which each continuing post shall link to.

It's not like I'm going to go out and kill a man to get my fix. I'm not that kind of addicted. I'm the opportunistic kind of addicted. Give me a computer

It's weird because it's so easy to say no when I'm in the swing of things. In daily life. Doing anything at all, and it really is that easy. Maybe it's the computer itself that's the trigger. I don't know. But just as easily I say no during most of my life, that ten seconds of boredom so easily entraps me in the lure of porn. 

All I needed was K9. If I had to work to find the stuff, like ""Go ahead, give me access to every porn known to man, throw that shit in my face, I can say no without breaking stride in my convorsation"". I could hop on my parents computer (unprotected) and there was no problem avoiding porn.

Porn is a sneaky bastard.

And then I got a new computer, I clicked the wrong link at the wrong time and there it was, the Monster was back. And then that stupid idea that looking at porn would get my sex drive back up again and make my girlfriend happy (honestly though, it worked, and it has stayed up, porn or no). And I spent three months living sid by side with porn once again, this time the Monster learned, it knows to linger and take it's time. Give me porn once a week. Twice a week.

1) **Go outside.** Take a walk, frollick in a field of daisies if that's your thing. Either way, engaging real life is so much more fulfilling than engaging in virtual addiction.

2) **Do something active.** Put all that energy to good use, squats, etc. This is a constructive way to not only take out some of that energy and anxiety you get when you want to watch porn but if you keep at it you'll notice that you feel physically healthier, which leads to better mental health.

3) **Smell Ammonia.** Seriously, etc.) BUT! do not do anything to physically harm yourself, that's counter productive.

4) **When you relapse, may as well finish masturbating/may as well watch porn all night) because you are rewarding your brain for watching porn. If you do look at porn, get away from it as soon as possible and do not continue watching it. Also, after a relapse do not beat yourself up, thinking that you are useless and stupid. Doing that only turns all your energy against yourself and breaks you down, making it much harder to continue fighting the urges you'll feel. Instead try and understand why you relapsed, and then grow from that knowledge.

5) **Make a visual reminder.** I have a pros and cons list (What do I get from watching porn? Nothing. What do I lose from watching porn? So much) next to my computer with a picture of my girlfriend

6) **Don't ignore your temptations.** But don't give into them either. Instead

7) **Vocal habits.** When you want to watch porn

8) **Purge your porn.** Whatever porn you have saved on your computer, shred them. Whatever porn dvds you have hidden away, burn them. Removing easy access to porn makes it much harder for you to slip, because then you have to actively seek much more for porn rather than just falling into your old habits (plus, it feels incredibly liberating to be away from all that temptation).

9) **When all else fails, go somewhere else, just get away from the source. You may have sleepless nights and you may be uncomfortable for a while, but this will pass.

I thought I would post this here since I need advice from people who have a similar point of view as myself about porn.

My husband and I are 25 years old and we have 2 children. We got married at 21. While we dated he knew my view on porn.. as I made it clear. I did not want to marry a man who watched porn. I found it disrespectful... I grew up in a house where I was taught it was wrong. I was quite shelterd though.. and in my head I only pictured 50 year old perverts watching porn. I never knew how much of an issue it really was for men or how ""normal"" it was for men to look. So when I told him about how I felt about it... we never went into a deep conversation about it..as I didn't really think it was a problem I had to worry about. 

After we got married I found out he was looking at porn and he hid it. Finally he told the truth. well he started hiding it and lying to me a lot and I pretty much felt like I couldn't trust him at all. One situation that I'm not going to bring up hurt the worst.. and I believe that's when I realized this porn issue was a BIG problem.. and not something that was going to be given up easily. 

He would say he was done

Well
Well one day I had a feeling he started back up on porn...I was right. I thought he had a slip... so I tried to still stay positive about it even though it did hurt. Well then I started questioning porn during deployment...in the end I finally found out that was all a lie too. And that's when finally I felt like this was a losing battle. All the trust I had just crashed. He never stopped. Even before deployment I was told.. it was all lies.
The lying about it really tends to hurt more then the porn habit itself. 


Anyways now about 2 years later... he's done with porn for good.. says he has been for a lil over a year now. I want to believe him and stay positive. And I try.. but it's hard. I feel like I don't want to get my hopes up. I don't want to be happy and trusting just to crash down again and feel total bitterness toward him. Atleast when I'm in this unsure mode.. it's like he might be.. but he might not and I feel...idk how to really explain it. But I feel safe like this. 

He really doesn't like it though. he wants me to trust him...he says he understands why  don't.. but he wishes I wouldn't question it at all. 

How do I do this and let go and trust? I know porn is an addiction. I know....and even though I know all of this... why do I feel like he's picked porn over me? I used to have very high confidence in my appearance.. as I'm not overweight or anything like that.. I just felt good about that aspect of myself.. (although I did have insecurities in others) But now since the porn issue I find myself always feeling bad about myself. Not the fact that he watched porn.. but the fact that he's had so much trouble to stop.. in my head I think to myself. ""those girls must have something really special that I don't for him to have so much trouble to stop looking at them"" 

And I know... I know it's addiction.. I've read all the things about it. But that's just a feeling I can't seem to shake no matter all of the facts I read about addiction.

Anyways.. how do I get past this ""safe"" zone I'm in.. how can I start to trust him again... knowing there's a chance I will just be let down. I just don't want to go through that again. ",,t5_2rglh,1366991911.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/pornfree/comments/1cy18i/how_to_trust_my_husband_again/

So that's the introduction done

I'm not going to reveal my age, and a lot of other teenagers. It's very easy to expose yourself to porn nowdays, and I believe that it is a problem.

Now you may be saying tl;dr, I guess I'm looking up to you guys now). Porn, for me has had an entrapment effect- It's something that started with a cursory glance, and got worse. It's also something that is hard to talk about. But I've found myself able to take breaks (two and half weeks break isn't much, but it's something.) because I've had rolemodels that are strong Christians and have talked about overcoming the addiction. They also follow God's word in daily life (One actively changes channel when risky stuff comes on, and avoids alcohol on principle).

Obviously rolemodels can only go so far (reason why I'm here), and so I ended up here.

On the other hand if you are quitting for health or to set a good example for others trying to quit you will find that your abstinence from cigarettes will become less variable (and that you have a better chance of not falling back into the habit after hours/days/weeks).

I'm really worried since I feel like I have no control during the binge. I get very little sleep and spend almost every hour of the day on craigslist or other sites. My brain keeps convincing me that I'm just repressing my natural desire and I should keep seeking it out, but it feels completely unnatural more like a drug. I don't think a gay or bi person would get the same sick rush feeling or feel the deep regret afterwards. I also get a rush thinking about doing weird stuff with females that I would normally find disgusting, but not to the same extent as trans.

Male 26 here. Recently decided to go cold turkey on porn. I don't have a problem with porn in principle

I started when I was about 13, that kind of thing. Turned to hardcore, then to short vid clips, then to full movies once DSL connections became available. At 24 I utterly lost control. Even tho I'm reasonably good looking, slim and in okay shape, I was a virgin, I was depressed, felt that I couldn't make it with girls. I found comfort in porn.

Luckily I've never spent a great deal of time nor money on porn.. just harddrive space. But after I got together with my first girlfriend I slowly started to realize that porn created problems. I found out that I'm turned on more by the thought of porn than actually having sex. Not the content of the porn

I've torn myself away now. I'm on the 12th day with no fapping nor watching porn. I've stumbled upon a couple of animated gifs while surfing reddit, unseen.

So far it's hell. I'm having physical withdrawal symptoms. Porn used to be something I turned to whenever I felt bored, I want to be with someone for sexual satisfaction. Sex is just so much more rewarding when I can truly enjoy it (which I've been able to on occasion, but mostly not). So I'm fighting my addiction every step of the way now.

I had been in relationships before, and I fought it, and won. I loaded the website of choice up and picked out a video and everything, but I didn't press play. As I sat there, looking at the thumbnail, something occurred to me. For the first time in my life, I was so sexually attracted to someone that I found them *more* attractive than the actors in the videos. I closed out of the site, and went and found something to distract myself from how odd I was feeling over the situation. That was the last time I ever loaded up a porn site. It's been almost two years since then

Because of the nature of *my* specific story, I strongly believe that, had I watched that video that day, the guilt would have been terrible afterwards. I didn't want anyone else as much as I wanted him, and, when we first discussed porn, two months down the road, but that it didn't ""feel right"" to look at porn while he was with me. Without knowing my history or why I had stopped

We have never had issues with porn in our relationship now, at some point or another, remarked on how happy we are together, and asked what our secret was. We usually chalk it up to chemistry, but I can't help but wonder, after learning more about what porn does to your brain, if it doesn't have a bit more to do with it than we thought.

Now, I was absolutely disgusted. I was appalled that so many people thought it was ""crazy"" or ""bitchy"" for a woman to be upset by the idea of her partner looking at porn. Then, I discovered nofap (which is a bit strict for my taste, to each their own, but my fiance and I do still participate in the occasional fapping, with imagination instead of videos or photos), and, pornfree.

When I was about 8 or 9 years old

Over the next couple of years my interest grew.  I would occasionally sneak onto the family computer and look up porn.  I didn't masturbate yet

Eventually I began masturbating and started doing it while watching porn.  It became a regular habit of mine to watch porn at least once a day while nobody was around.  

The longer that it has been going on for

When I was 13 or 14

I had several girlfriends throughout my teenage years.  None of my earlier relationships were affected by my porn use.  I would always become excited by my girlfriends and had no trouble getting or maintaining an erection.  My most recent relationship

Porn had given me a very false sense of what sex and intimacy was like by this point.  I went through a long phase during my two year relationship when I would commonly experience ED.  I always felt extremely anxious in real life sexual situations and would not be able to get or maintain an erection.  This problem passed as I began to get more comfortable with my girlfriend, I believe that my porn use was a major factor in this.  I never told her how much I was watching porn or how it was affecting my life.  

I quit watching porn for about 2 months a couple of years ago.  During that time I was able to enforce in my mind a black and white rule about porn.  I simply wasn't allowed to look at it.  This is what I need to do again

I am now a single 20 year old man who has been addicted to porn for over half of my life.  I am terrified to get into another relationship because of whether or not I will be able to perform sexually.  This is not normal and I didn't used to be this way.  I am always wondering what my life would be like if I hadn't become addicted to porn.  

I want to have a healthy sex life.  I want to be able to deal with stress without turning to porn.  I want to be able to be sincerely intimate with a woman.  I don't want to be afraid of not getting an erection or not being able to orgasm.  I don't want to be afraid of being caught looking at porn.  I don't want to feel pathetic.  

Besides this problem I am a completely normal, so I just deal with my sex drive with masturbation.  I know that quitting porn and decreasing my frequency of masturbation will make it more likely that I will get a girl and have a good sex life.  

I know that this will be read by understanding people.  Please give me feedback.  Tell me about your issues

I'm no neuro scientist, it excites me. Porn released huge amounts of dopamine right, and exercise releases a much smaller amount? I think I was able enjoy that smaller amount MUCH more since I don't have that huge amount in my life any more! 

This could just be a false correlation and me being super excited about my first runners high after five freaking years of running. What do you guys/gals think?

******************************************************

I have been reading this subreddit for a few weeks now, and PMO has just reared its ugly head again... 

I didn't anticipate writing a post this morning, and think: maybe I need to write something and share it... start the next stage of the process...

So - Here is my story

I'm in my mid/late thirties, read by everyone, lots of giggles, but also profound stimulation... Looking at lingerie/swimwear sections of mail order catalogues... Finding erotic literature at my Dad's house (that introduced me to some concepts that I'm finding very hard to shake off, as they really touched a live wire in my brain, and made a connection that arouses me unlike anything else)... Buying actual porn magazines for a while.... and then... THE INTERNET. 

Reading some of the stories from younger members

So my situation now, growing up with my (divorced/single) mother and older sister. As soon as I had discovered masturbation in my early teens, it was something that I (naturally) wanted to do A LOT. So my home situation left me alone quite frequently, and also afforded me quite a bit of time to set up my increasingly elaborate PMO sessions. The Pavlovian response to hearing the front door close has never really gone away, and since discovering r/nofap, I have started to notice it, and be alert to the spiral of thoughts that it triggers. This helps. It's like a similar technique in mindfulness meditation - let your awareness sink down lower and lower to where the root/origin of the un-useful thought pattern is

So that's my ""home"" scenario

One of the worst scenarios for me is being away from home, working on other creative projects in the hotel room, shopping for yourself, or for gifts for the family, etc. etc... Right? 
...Right... *sarcasm*

I have lost count of the days that I have lost to extended PMO sessions in a darkened hotel room, with a lot of edging. Once I have orgasmed, the feelings of shame and disappointment creep up, and I might then start drinking to really *finish off the day in style*. 

In a way, and I can spend most of that time in PMO cycles. 

The last long stretch I had away from home

But here I am again. Away from home, supportive, fun, fulfilling and balanced marriage with an amazing, creative, intelligent &amp; beautiful woman. She is literally the woman of my dreams. Sexually we have a great time, and can talk about our needs pretty well. But when I am away from her

I think this is how it goes in my head:
Feeling lonely -&gt; need comforting -&gt; physical pleasure is comfort -&gt; masturbation is physical pleasure -&gt; cannot masturbate without porn -&gt; *looks at porn*.

(This also applies to alcohol

Looking at porn as a way to combat loneliness sounded ridiculous to me at first, getting into a PMO session, then realising that I've been awake for two hours and haven't called my wife to say good morning. That is fucked up, and shameful. 

So basically that's my situation. (Sorry this is a long post!)

Here's what I want to achieve:

1. To be porn free. 
2. To ""retrain"" my dick not to rely on my hand for that specific sensation. (Dan Savage - @fakedansavage - talks a lot about ""The Death Grip"" that men use for masturbation

Here's what I hope the results will be:

1. Higher self-esteem
2. Better interaction with other human beings
3. More fulfilling sex life with my wife (blowjobs with endings!).

Thank you for taking the time to read this. 

I think I have realised while writing this that I might need to talk to my wife about some of these issues

Ok. Got to go now. 

THANK YOU.

p.s. (there's more???) - My own personal opinion is that masturbation is NOT WRONG. It is a healthy expression of sexuality - or at least it should be. But I understand that PMO binds up masturbation with porn &amp; shame, and deal with it all separately. In the context of a shared experience with a partner, masturbation / mutual masturbation is, IMHO, completely fine and wonderful. Here's to healthy sex lives with REAL PEOPLE!

1361619116.0,192r14,(Longish) Intro from Leopardo del Oro,LeopardoDelOro,14,0,3,"Hi Folks -

I am new to this board.  I am also

I am forty-three years old.  I have been bouncing back and forth in porn addiction and sobriety for most of the twenty years since I had my first orgasm while awake (I was a late bloomer).  I am happy for you youngsters who are nipping this shit in the bud at a younger age.

Sometimes it has seemed to me that porn binges are the most pleasant activity that I've done in my adult life.  Not sure if that's true - I've done lots of different fun and healthy things, which is that sometimes unfortunately we need to give up the most pleasant thing for us in life, so that all of the rest of our life can become more pleasant.

Porn addiction has, like the first step in the twelve-steps says, apparently absolutely powerless over my actions.  Watching the ""Your Brain On Porn"" has helped me to understand the mechanism of limbic brain hijack.

I have, spent days at a time in a narcotic haze inside ""the bubble"", doing nothing else but being on my knees worshiping the jpg/mpg goddesses, blocking out the outside world as best I could, only eating, using the toilet, and sleeping when I absolutely could not put it off any longer.  I've drained my lifeforce so badly at times that it took five or six days to recover and felt human again.  I've rubbed so vigorously and for so long that I've gotten scabs that have taken a month or two to heal, lost friendships

There have also been times that I have been porn-free, often with the help of SAA meetings and/or making commitments to men's teams that I have been on.  Those years have often been some of the most productive, happy, loving, alive, and growth-filled of my adult life.

At this point, and my relationship with my gf has gotten noticeably stronger.  I have been feeling more comfortable around people and more proud of who I am.

One thing that has helped me to stay sober has been being honest with people around me - my girlfriend, the impact that it has had, the strength of my urges, and my desire to stay sober.  The largest part of stopping porn-fapping however has been making a commitment to the current men's team that I am on.  I told them that I would email them if I broke my word, and there have been times over the past few months when the urges have been so strong, but I felt like I would be damned if I was going to have to email them and admit breaking down - so my pride kept me sober.  I also have a commitment with them in place to meditate for half an hour immediately before any fapping, with no activities (such as getting on my computer) in between.   This seems to help me to only fap when I am being intentional about it, and not out of real-life-avoidance or impulse.

I have however looked at and downloaded porn during the last six months.  Well, as y'all know, if I have started looking at some, I start to want to look at more, and then I do not seem to have been able to put a stop to those ""look at porn"" limbic highjacks.  I notice that, as always, I have looked at porn not as act or recreation, or when my work (I am working on starting a business) seems impossible/overwhelming.

I have noticed that a big part of the addiction of me is the collecting and organizing of files.  It's like my brain thinks that gathering up some new flv file, I've accomplished something, like I somehow own one more girl.  This is true, of course, even if, as usual, I never look at the file again.

There are times over the years where I look at porn and have thought, porn is hot - that's its job.  Yeah, there are a lot of hot females in this world too.  There's a lot of hotness in this world. And, none of it means that I am necessarily supposed to do anything about it.  Usually, what my highest calling seems to do is to take a deep breath, circulate the energy, and go on with what I was going to do before getting all turned on.

There have been times when I have slipped back into the addiction by telling myself that ""all my friends do it"", it's the same thing, might as well look at the real thing"", ""my problem real is just that I am uptight and judgmental about porn"", ""written word stories are OK, they're not really porn"".

Many of my friends have told me how much they enjoy porn, no problems with their daily use of it. Many of them have urged me to loosen up and just enjoy it. This used to trip me up, and I think that I used it as a rationalization a few times to go back to using porn when I could/should have known better.

Then I notice that I have friend who are recovering alcoholics, and I certainly can't recall the last time drinking affected my life negatively.

So

* The porn-bubble is not the real world

""Pornography is just 'fast-food feminine energy', it pales in insignificance to a fully embodied loving woman."" -- Barry Long

* My relationships with women I date as well as with my friends and family seem to feel more clean

* I keep my word more, and respect myself more when I am porn-free

* The PMO urge usually seems to happen when I feel stopped, defeated, hopeless, avoidant, or when I feel a surge of energy, possibility, openness, the desire to enter the bubble often happens when I dislike how I am feeling in the real world.  I have literally

* Again and again, it immediately comes to me that either stopping porn/compulsive fapping, or staying stopped, is the number one thing that I can do to improve my life

* I have more physical vitality, and openness to happiness and magic when I am PMO-sober


Here are some tools that have helped me to stay sober:

* Talking about the addiction and my desire/commitment to stay sober with any friend who it is appropriate to talk about it with.

* IMO, and get external help - that's the big rocket.  I've stayed sober more when I have had a commitment/accountability buddy, been on a men's team and made a commitment to them, 
and/or made commitments to therapists coaches or spiritual teachers.

* SAA meetings are great.  I also love online forums like this one, I think helps to create a paradigm of sobriety, and helps to counteract  the sexuality/porn-iness that seems to pervade the internet. 

* Like I said

* For years, feeling, experience, or piece of information, I would add it to the document, either the pro or con.  Eventually, I could look at all of my various opinions about it, overall

* Finally
 - the date(s)
 - how long I spent porn-ing/fap-ing
 - how many orgasms
 - why I think I slipped (ie feeling overwhelmed with work, etc)
 - how I felt during the binge
 - how I felt after the binge (usually drained dirty and socially withdrawn
 - what (negative, positive) impact the binge had on the rest of life - impact on other people, on my mood, on my productivity, on doing what I intended to do

Every once in a while, and seeing the immense negative impact that porn binges have had on my life, had helped to decrease the ""it's OK just one more time"" denial.

It got so bad that I couldn't get out of bed without first spanking the monkey and had binges whenever I was home alone over the weekend.

The first 2 weeks went by fairly quickly. I've kept my focus on noFap and failed so I was telling myself to at least not watch any more porn. I didn't feel the urge to either which seemed strange to me. 
But for the last few days my brain was all like ""you didn't miss porn for 2 weeks. Boy treat yourself to some porn! 'cause you are no addict. you've proven that!"". 
So you can probably understand why I'm all bummed out.

I know it's no ""I've done it and chicks are all over me now!"" story. And it's not supposed to be. I just wanted to not need porn in my life anymore and cut the fapping to a reasonable level. I'm down to 4 times a week.

I'm on day 23 of nofap/no porn and have realized the 2 are very different animals.

Longer version

It all started when I read this guy's blog about his porn free experience.

From there I discovered the nofap reddit and decided to give it a go.

I'm on day 23 and I've realized no porn and no fap (masturbation) are two very different animals.

First

For me, it's just my experience. For me, it's not a matter of depriving myself something I crave it was simply the epiphany that porn isn't good for my brain. 

I don't want my brain's relationship with sex to be one where I see literally hundreds of different naked girls in the span of an hour or one where I can access ANY sexual fantasy, together with an Asian girl with fake boobs, on a beach from a pov camera angle? No problem, just need 30 seconds to find it. 

Once I took a step back and thought about how different that is from a normal

No Fap:

No masturbation on the other hand has been challenging! I had sex very early on in the challenge but not since, I think it's normal and healthy. In fact the only reason I'm doing it is because I found the nofap reddit before I found the pornfree reddit!

I'm 24 years old and have been watching P online on a regular basis since I was 9. I come from a somewhat troubled family background and I think that it helped me fill a certain void in my life, I have come to realize, was a seriously twisted and unhealthy one.

During the first years, I have found that it is perfectly acceptable, on a society level, for a male teenager to have such habits. As such, I never really got to question myself. Of course, as I'm sure all of you have experienced, the stuff that I needed became dirtier and dirtier, I'd have a few moments of ""what am I doing with my life?""
Luckily

It is only more recently that my life has changed drastically, my friends, my jobs, my apartments were always changing. Slowly, I began to realize it. I realized it when I turned crazy during a 1-week vacation with no internet (I would spend hours roaming the streets with my phone, trying to find an unsecured wifi network). I realized it when I noticed that the only time of the day I'd smile was when I came back home after a hard day's work and typed in my favorite address in the browser. Or when I would have to take a break from work because I couldn't wait until the evening. Or when I would turn down an invitation for a date later in the evening because I knew there was a finished torrent waiting for me at home (I actually did that...).

But this is all stuff you've probably experienced
For me, she was exactly my type of girl - I felt great around her and I liked pretty much everything about her. Then came the time when things started getting intimate... It felt great at the beginning of the night. But when shit got real, I just couldn't get my shit together and simply bailed out. That's right, ""sorry I can't do it"" and that was that. I couldn't get myself to do what I had to, I didn't want to, I wanted things quick, effortless, but to no avail

Obviously, what she meant to me and what we could have had together if I weren't such a poor excuse for a man (and this thinking has led to alcohol issues, to top it all), I've decided that enough is enough. This is not who I want to be, and I will, I shall change my habits and bend my personality to re-orient it towards a version of myself I can actually like and be proud of. I will dedicate all my strength to it. Currently my strength is not sufficient, so I've joined the gym and been reading a lot about confidence, and responsibility.

I have never been in a relationship that has lasted longer than a few months. I've only ever attempted to have sex four times in my entire life and each time was a failure. I can't even begin to put into words how this has affected my life.

The first time I tried to have sex with a girl I was 17 and had been masturbating to porn multiple times a day for a few years. The girl was a friend from school. We tried on two different occasions with the same result. I could go for a few minutes but would lose my erection because I was felt very little sensation. My friend was more experienced than I and she reassured me this happened to other guys. Still this really messed with my head. I stopped chasing after girls as I became pretty self conscious and just stuck with what I was good at

I've had many opportunities to have sex over the years without even trying. But when the moment got close I would come up with an excuse to why we shouldn't. The third time, stayed hard for awhile but lost my erection after a few minutes.

 I thought maybe it was all in my head but I made an appointment to see a specialist anyway. My results were good

A few years later when I was 23 I started dating this girl who asked me out. She was beautiful and smart and I really liked her. A few months in after much stalling and I told her about my struggles (I knew now that porn might be a problem but I never told her about it). She was really understanding and wanted to work through it together. This was a relief but I would soon realize that I was pretty emotionally messed up and would never really let her in. We tried having sex once and it was the same old story. We broke up not too long after. I started to hate myself and completely gave up hope of being with someone.

These last few years have been hard. I know I have a problem but haven't been able to do much about it. A few months ago I went 30 days without watching porn or masturbating. I was happy and so proud of myself. I would get hard just looking at an attractive woman and imagining what we could do together. Life just seemed better

I have never told anyone my problems before and when I found this place I just wanted to get it all off my chest. My addiction to porn is effecting my life in every way imaginable. I'm terrified of girls

I will be checking in a few times a week to talk about how it is going. I urge others who read this to do the same thing, experiencing love, and we definitely aren't happy. We can do this!!


UPDATE 1: Day 13 (June 3rd) is almost over and I'm still going strong. The first few days were the hardest but I kept myself pretty busy working outside. In the past I would spend most of my night on the computer until I would eventually find my way to a porn site. Now I have made a rule for myself that my computer is to be turned off for the night around 8:00 (It's already 8:30 now so I will be off as soon as I'm done here). I spend the next few hours before bed reading or watching sports/movies. This has made a huge difference so far. It definitely hasn't been easy but when I do get an urge I would just remind myself how much I want to put this behind me and move on.  Not only have I stopped using porn but I haven't masturbated at all. I found that in the past doing so would just lead me back to porn not too long after. I plan on going a few months without masturbating so I can trust myself to stay away from porn. If I have a few wet dreams so be it and I probably wouldn't mind it happening to be honest.

I used to watch porn on a daily basis and masturbate with it. I noticed that when getting together with a new girl after some time being single (and watching porn)

At first I thought that it was simply sexual anxiety and fear of not being able to get it up, I started getting fearful of ED, and started taking viagra. Here another problem began in that I started becoming dependent on viagra for my confidence in bed. This is terrible since it would increase my anxiety by trying to guess when sex would occur.

I've been doing badly at my studies for 4 years now. If I don't sort myself out NOW I will fail

Porn addiction is my biggest biggest contributor to my situation. Once I start, my ability to think clearly jumps off a cliff.

Now I'm tired, can't get up in the morning, depressed and still haven't done the work I was meant to be doing. I've come to realise how much porn drains my ability to enjoy anything else.

940 gigs of porn. That's the absurd amount I have gathered over the last eight years or so. It's gone now. About half an hour ago I was watching a clip, calmly checked just how much gigabytes I would free up. Ctrl-A, Shift + Delete. It felt like the right thing to do. I expected to be relieved, and I'm not, but it still feels like I did the right thing.

I'm a 28 year-old gay guy and I have looked at porn since I was twelve. That's when I got internet. Needless to say

I must have downloaded hundreds of gigabytes in the following years. Naturally, I burned everything on cd's, carefully structured and labelled. I had a password-protected database in Microsoft Access to keep track of everything I had and what was where. When I was twenty, I had a big, locked chest full of those cd's and dvd's.

It did not occur to me, it seemed an accepted fact that all boys and men watched porn. It's mainstream, almost viewed as healthy. So I spent hours and even days on this 'healthy' collection. There came a point where I had collected so much porn that it was simply impossible keep track of everything. When I downloaded something, I literally had to look up in my database if I already had it, and at what resolution. Still, the word 'obsession' never crossed my mind. And, I'm ashamed to admit this, I never realised that I might have a problem.

Actually, started to play a bigger role in my life, and I started to question some things in my life. Instinctively, I felt that porn could not be a part of the person I wanted to be. I think the porn industry exploits people and causes an immense amount of suffering. I was also aware that some acts depicted in pornography were degrading and definitely not in line with how I believe human beings should treat each other. Seeing that, I spoke my mind about the subject to a friend. But I was the world's biggest hypocrite: while we had our conversation, a 6TB server was happily torrenting porn at multiple MB's/sec.

Yes, but I do have a 2TB drive reserved for porn exclusively. Also, I had a special, secure configuration of XBMC (media centre software) with manually maintained meta information on every single movie I had. I shudder to think about all the time I wasted on it.

Then, or at least some kind of problem. Even IF looking at porn was an innocent habit, the way I did it was definitely NOT. Some googling led me to Gary Wilson's famous TED-talk and NoFap, and things started clicking together.

I have wasted an incredible amount of time on something that is not beneficial in any way and even harmful to others and myself. In fact, but seldomly feel any 'real' physical attraction towards a guy, so I end up rejecting guys quite often. Even after three dates with a great guy, knowing that he's *actually* quite attractive… somehow it's rarely good enough for me. I don't know, this might be some other issue… but I wouldn't be surprised if there's a deep link with porn here.

So I deleted my porn, because part of me is already starting to regret it. I'm not yet sure about 'true' nofap (still digging into the threads over there), but I have to beat this weird and disgusting habit.

The hard part for me is finding places outside of my group of friends to be social. I go to a large school that has a reputation for being a party school and I myself have made the life decision not to drink ever. I already know that I have an addictive personality, I will join more clubs and try to interact with more people this year.

I was doing a little better because I finally had the good idea to make my password to K9 a randomly generated 10 digit combination of numbers and letters, getting the password, driving home, etc.  (porn at work is thankfully impossible...way too much activity around my office).

Then saturday I found a site that wasn't blocked.  Not hardcore porn

The bigger problem is that lately, yet I won't have REAL SEX with an actual women who really loves and cares for me?  What the hell!

I'm pretty upset about these feelings and I don't know what to do.  I feel like I have to turn off my sex drive to beat my porn addiction

But essentially I want to be better. I'm 22 and have lost far too much of my life to porn. This Toshiba laptop I've owned since 2009 has stolen far too much of my life and my sexuality. Although it's easy to feel bad about time wasted

Although there are lots of arguments over whether porn use is bad or not, and then leaves me feeling depressed, delaying plans and not wanting to talk to people and make up an excuse as to what I've been doing for the last few hours. I don't want to do that anymore.

So I'm putting this on /pornfree and will keep everyone updated. The internet is a major part in our problems

In our case

Here's one such barrier I run into over and over:
I notice I get locked into the craving for release, my eyes, neck, my hands and wrists, my belly, my breathing, my back, it all changes. And there's a sweet spot that I'm trying to move everything through and towards before I feel like disengaging.  Moreover I don't usually want to disengage but rather rinse and repeat until I blow out my receptors.  I have to get exhausted

WALL- I am in the cycle.
MOVE-  Get away from the source of filth - shut the computer off.  WALL- I don't
MOVE- Wait until I complete
WALL- I don't. I look at something else for awhile until my senses
MOVE- Wait until I am exhausted.  Possibly until I have burned out my receptors for the time being.  
WALL- Fall asleep exhausted

What is my strongest counter-move to improve the situation? In order to  make my first strongest move to have escaped the computer and my mad craving

My hypothesis is that I can break out of a cycle that is in action by noticing the cue that is priming the stimulus/response, just very shallow breath), I'm not aware of the breath while I am acting out. My attention is on the result: the pleasant buzz that is increasing or decreasing relative to this form of breath (as well as the speed and intensity of other mechanics of this operation).  So to break this hypnosis, I shift my focus from the pleasure produced onto the process breath.  It almost feels like flipping from first person to third person narrative, it's the same story but you're seeing things differently.  Since the story has always played out the same in the past, now you can recondition what certain sensations (from this perspective) mean, and practice a different response (what makes sense in third person is different than from the limits of first person). For example, changes in breath

1369648047.0,1f4pbj,4th attempt: My experience so far...,thebeatofmyowndrum,13,1,6,"Hi all

So after a difficult few days where I threw everything out and edged like a demon to porn until I couldn't take it no more (perhaps because I knew it might be my last time ever), I'm disappointed, but extremely eager to begin my 4th attempt.

I wanted to journal my experiences so far

Some thoughts:

- Avoid deliberate gazing at sexual imagery for sexual thrill. It is a fantasty. It isn't real. I want to live in reality. Reality is the future. Fantasy is the past.

- Refrain from any masturbation.

- My sexual urges build and build without masturbation, become part of how I feel constantly. I MUST MUST MUST release this tension by masturbation. There is no way around this. From my experience, the longer I hold onto that sexual tension, the more it becomes a distraction, and the more I start to enjoy it, and ultimately it becomes an overwhelming force that I cannot escape. I must learn to accept masturbation as a personal choice, and a necessary action for myself to avoid sex becoming a dominating thought/feeling/force in my life. I appreciate that for some people this may not be an option, or at least

- Maintain personal fitness. This is a good replacement indulgence. Visit the gym as often as possible

- I must remain focused on the idea that porn is a fantasy. I have had enough of this. My goal is to meet a girl to have a relationship with, for each other. Porn will kill that future. With porn, there is no future.

- Lastly, I can offer support, and when I'm feeling vunerable, I have a bunch of amazing guys who are willing to support me too. And helping others on here has helped focus my own efforts.

Still, and I keep reminding myself ""You have to make it through day 1 to get to day 2."" Tomorrow I'll remind myself ""You have to make it through day 2 to get to day 3.""

I am excited; I'm not sure why though, hell who knows, maybe that was my last relapse ever (probably not, but I'm aiming for that goal).

* **A more accurate view of women** - of course, there's some part of you that doesn't consider that. Some part that sees them as something...less. Like some gift you deserve to have because its there. Luckily though, that's rapidly fading! Now, in part, I can view them more like I would a sister.

* **A more accurate view of men** - on the flip side of the above, to outcompete. But now that's all but gone, that odd animal sort of paranoia. I can see them more like I would a brother.

* **A more accurate view of sex** - To be honest, means to get that end. Kinda like in that episode of Metalocalypse where they're talking about how getting someone to suck their salami was pretty much their whole reason for making their music

Now, that's wonderful. But, its a spice, not the main dish

Brothers, the eyes. Our eyes, naturally, are the most common form of entrance for this sort of addiction. Yes, there's audio, but most of us either end up at porn or worse by looking at things first. Those pictures, some of them rather tame at first, as we struggle to free ourselves from the chains of this addiction

Next, or to just wander off that walking path usually leads to disastrous results. The same applies to our addiction - if we don't stick to the path, stick to the plan, we end up with disastrous results, and God doesn't want that for us. Don't turn to the right hand or the left - don't let images or possible triggers cause you to look away and step off the path. 

Lastly, don't even find yourself in that situation, brothers and sisters! Run from it! If it pops up in an innocuous situation, close the window! Find another website! GET OUT AND GET OFF THE PC.

Some guys report that after some time clean they achieved some goals (aka pornfree superpowers), but I fell I've opened the path and I'm willing to follow it.

For everyone trying to fight this addiction:

It's not easy

**tl;dr:** 90 days clean. Proud of myself. Didn't get any superpowers but I feel capable of performing heroic deeds. For everyone trying: do it,False,,t5_2rglh,1357407954.0,,,t3_160iiv

I hope everyone is having an invigorating start to their week

I wanted to tell you guys a few things about my posting here. First of all, the easiest way to access it would be for you to click on my username and see what I've been up to - the most recent post should be right near top of my page. Also, once you find my new post, try giving it an upvote. I cant stress how important they are to getting our posts seen. I don't get any karma, but it makes it convenient for everyone.

So those are just a few pointers, but an individual human being with extremely complex and sometimes irrational minds, just like me. Through our struggle, we have not only made the highly important decision to quit, but are constantly learning about our own brains and how they operate every day.

So even though porn has ruined our lives, why we run away from problems, why it is important to be brave, why control is crucial in life etc. etc... 

Because we're not running away from this to forget our journeys. No

With that being said

For me the most important thing is noporn.  i can look back over a long period of time ( wont say how long) and see that i didnt try to meet women (are there women here?!) because I knew I could have porn.  It decreases your motivation to chase women.  And we all want to fall asleep with a woman in our arms!  Or lets just say someone to love.  
Since I havent fapped in almost 5 days I have noticed a change.  More assertive.  No shame in my heart; i feel better about myself because i haven't seen some stupid young girl jizzed up by a horde of grinning swine.  Horny is good.  I feel I have a chance with women, go to a yoga class.  then fake a hamstring pull; you'll get mobbed by hot women in sports tops and skintights, haha!  Seriously, this is a good place.

I picture my porn addiction was like an iceberg, and when my wife is too tired to have sex, I masturbate to porn and go to sleep.  I'm just like any other guy.""

But the part below the water, that I cannot get enjoyment out of everyday activities because they all pale in comparison to porn.  When I'm working, I take frequent breaks to look at facebook, but I'm actually just looking for someone attractive to look at and get a micro ""fix.""  I look at a website with graphic design pictures because intermingled were pictures of naked women.  I pretend I'm interested in the artistry of what I'm looking at.  I convince myself that I'm into photography and that I would be a very artistic erotic photographer.  I wonder if my wife would let me do that.  I could quit my job and photograph naked girls for a living.  When I'm driving down the street and I see an attractive girl walking on the sidewalk I slow down so I can stare at her the entire time I cruise by.  When an attractive girl crosses the street in front of my car at a stop light I take in every detail of her body and fixate on it for every second I can.  I see the experience as a precious gift, I feel for a moment like I'm immersed in love, like I just had a whole relationship in my mind with the person.  I'll use all of these experiences later when looking at porn.  I'll try to find people in movies and pictures that look like my momentary fixations of the day.  And all of this is completely empty, lonely

The addiction is also like a tree, things that might not seem like porn but I'm using them for the same purpose, and the branches get so thin at the ends that you can barely see them, but they lead back to the trunk, the root of everything wrong.  

I feel like a lot of us who are fighting our porn addictions are looking only at the trunk of this tree and trying to hack at it with a hatchet.  For some of us the trunk is thick

But here's what has helped me so far...

Attack the branches.  Find them.  Follow the limbs out until they almost disappear.  The things that lead back to the trunk in ways you don't even want to admit to yourself.  If you begin to destroy those branches and limbs, weakened.  

Attack the branches and the tree will die.",,t5_2rglh,False,,month2,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/pornfree/comments/zv6xk/kill_the_tree_branches_first/

When I first made the decision (after watching the great porn experiment video) to stop using porn and masturbating, I was prepping myself for that late night session all day long by sneaking peeks at stimulating material throughout the day

So it feels like the last couple days have been harder than usual.  The ""honeymoon"" phase is starting to wear off and the feelings of self-empowerment are fading.  I know that I'm not going to break down and I'm not going to falter, she's like a precious baby deer that just leapt out of the bushes, savor her rare beauty!"" but I have to force myself not to stare, look away, and I actually think ""damnit, why do I have to deal with this right now.""  I feel angry.

But one other thing I noticed is that I must have more testosterone in my system, but I stood up for myself and something I didn't think was right.  Afterward I thought to myself, ""I'm actually growing a pair.""  I'm not taking the passive stance of someone who only cares about busting their nut later, I'm standing up for myself and my self worth, which is increasing as I realize the control I'm gaining over myself.

You shouldn't be drinking either, you decided last week you'd stop drinking during the week because it'd make the weekends more fun and its more becoming of a responsible adult, but here you are, like a child, stuffing yourself because you have zero self-control.

We're longdistance for three months right now and I decided to try NoFap more seriously this time (I've been trying for almost one year, but things are not rosy.

I CAN'T prevent myself from looking at porn. It is impossible. For these 17 days, I just sit and browse videos and watch, like this. I am crazy. I know it's bad, and obviously none of my ED problems are gone. It's like these 17 days are worth nothing. I still crave dopamine and I have to give it to my brain.

I tried to install an extension for blocking the websites but I always find a way around. I tried meditation, I tried to acknowledge the urge and simply chosing not to look at porn but it's like a drug. I swear, this is a life battle. I don't know if someone will understand my situation. I don't know what to do. I know I simply HAVE to discipline myself but it's like I refuse to give my mind the strength to do it.

Help me

I'm sick of myself. I'm not strong enough to resist the temptation.

These are the questions that I've been asking myself lately as the urges have been arising. In the past this would have led to me feeling sorry for myself and subsequently trying to push away that pain by looking at porn for hours on end. The cruel twist of fate (as we all know) was that afterwards, led to more porn. It was a downward spiral of anxiety and depression that lasted for years before finally coming to a tipping point 53 days ago when I said no more.

It's a bit scary knowing that I don't have that easy escape anymore and that I'm now trying to tackle my problems head-on instead of running away from them. But even when the urges are so strong it takes every fiber of my being to not give in

So why can't I be like everyone else? Because this is the life I have been given and I must accept that. Do I wish things had gone differently in the past? Oh boy

Stay strong even when it feels like all is lost. Keep pushing everyday to become the person you want to be. There is *always* a choice.

1367615934.0,1dn5zu,MY rules for Pornfree. Another Guide to assist you on your journey.,NoFaPornFree,17,5,6,"Basically
We're here because of a porn addiction/bad porn habits. We're here because we want to change or ways and become better than we were. Some of us are here just for fun

Well

* **DO NOT watch porn**  
-Clearly, and pretty sloppy. It gives us false expectations and ridiculously obscene, unhealthy desires.  


* **DO NOT LOOK for/Browse for porn.**  
-This is my greatest weakness: The fact that I still have the desire to ""Look up"" a certain video. Maybe I wanna see what's new in the porn world
What also counts as ""looking for"" porn. If you see an image thumbnail of a hot girl, and walking right into it. STOP admiring her hot body if it's only gonna turn you on and fuel your cravings! Don't click on a link if it's NSFW, because you and I both know what it means. It means either Gore of Nudity. 50-50 chance of stumbling onto porn. Don't make the click, don't take the risk.  
If you're watching an R rated movie, and think of something else. What I do if look at the corner of the screen, and think of colors until the scene is over. That's just me. If you purposely watch the movie for that particular scene, especially if you rewind the movie to that scene just to watch it again, you know it counts as breaking this rule!. do not lie to yourself!

This leads me to my next rule!  

* **DO NOT THINK about Porn**  
-Get rid of that porn infested mind. it's full of gross, and that is **NOT YOUR** dick!! That is some strangers dick, do you really think your dick is that big? Also, that girl isn't riding you, she's fucking some stranger. She has no clue you exist!  
Those fantasies you have, you're just replaying a memory of a porn video. That person doing the girl isn't you, and that girl that he's doing isn't the same girl you're looking at (unless you're looking at a porn star.) Think about this next time you fantasize.  

* if it wasn't made clear in the last rule
-It can't be said any clearer. Fantasizing will only make you want to search for that certain video, get moving, do something else that's productive. Get your mind busy, and OFF of the idea of porn. Go do pushups, or jog, or do your homework.

**What definitely counts as a reset?** Breaking the first two rules: Watching porn and searching for porn. The fact that you even bothered to look for it
This being said

**HERE** are some of my older post.

**As I have said

Thanks for reading!!  

**EDIT:**  
I'd like to ad something to my ""Do not look for porn"" rule! Do not search for non-nudes of porn stars. don't even search for anything non-nude that's sexual related. examples: girls in bikinis, yet you still think it's okay to search for an alternative (which isn't much of an alternative. It's pretty much the same thing!) Just **DON'T!!!**

when making a significant change to one's life, but it's not possible, especially with something that's become truly addictive. if you're 'a person who wants to look at porn but doesn't', then you'll *constantly* be fighting with yourself, you'll be in conflict with your desires. you really have to change yourself into '*a person who doesn't want to look at porn*'.

more easily said than done, etc. it's a kind of zen thing - you have to get outside yourself, and be open to letting *who you are* be changed at the deepest level. [this post by the last pychiatrist blog](http://thelastpsychiatrist.com/2012/06/amy_schumer_offers_you_a_look.html) is a really, really important read, and sums up a lot of these ideas. most importantly:

&gt; For a great many people this leads to an unconscious

&gt; &lt;doing awesome&gt;

&gt; is better than

&gt; &lt;feeling terrible about yourself&gt;

&gt; is better than

&gt; &lt;the mental work of change&gt;

&gt; You should memorize this, and admittedly that feels like mental work because it's exhausting and unrewarding, but you can no more ruminate your way through a life crisis than a differential equation.

thinking about yourself as a new kind of person also makes relapse less of a big deal. if you're a person who wants to look at porn but chooses not to, a rolling back of all the work you've done because it breaks your perfect streak. if you've managed to mold yourself into a person who doesn't want to look at porn, then if you happen to relapse, it's not a big deal, because you're *still a person who doesn't want to look at porn*. your defense is in your identity.

sorry if this is kind of rambly, it probably helped me just to type it out and remind myself of it. read the tlp article, read it critically, and take it to heart. trust me. sometimes i think he's full of shit, but most of this article is incredibly spot-on. i come back to it regularly.",,False,t5_2rglh,True

I have been addicted to porn since I was 14, daily, get high and watch shemale porn which is more stimulating than regular porn).

It's hard to admit that I have an addiction

I took my first step to reducing my porn use about 8 months ago. Looking back I have come a pretty long way. Yesterday, ever, I was able to browse through a tube website without having an impulse to open a video, watch it, and you know what comes next. Still for some reason I wanted to open it, as if there was a memory of something satisfying in it when I know there is no satisfaction, only shame.

I started 8 months ago and did not have a set goal other than no overstimulation. Stick to one porn video and change it every 3-4 weeks. It was better than before

I have a multitude of 100GB+ torrents that I looked at one or two movies and never paid attention to again.  But to delete them, I feel compelled to look at the entire set or it's just downright painful to get rid of it.

I would daresay I spend maybe only 15 minutes a day fapping but much more time collecting - and that part is the bigger problem.  Well that

1303600288.0,gvzhx,My addiction to porn lost me the girl of my dreams,xmiirx,23,10,6,"**Background:**
So I've been dating this great girl since June of '09, I'd say probably 4-5 major relapses in the past 6 years (I'm 18 almost 19 now). We've had a pretty good relationship, of course ups and downs but overall we were extremely happy with each other. She was the first girl I ever did any real fooling around with, and for about the first 6 months I watched no porn and was incredibly happy (I hadn't watched porn for a few months before we started dating also). I had told her I had struggled with Porn through my life from the beginning.

**The Beginning:**
The amount of our fooling around started to drift away due to some personal issues, and we actually had a lot of fun together. Well that night I asked her if I could watch it on my own. She didn't like that at all, and I don't think I did that first night.

**The Addiction:**
So on and off we're watching porn together, I'm sure nowhere near 100% but I definitely wanted it a lot of the time.

**College + Addiction**
So when the time came for college, only working on the weekend and only about 3 hours of class a day. I would spend every evening from 2-11 with my girlfriends, but I normally stay up until 1-3 am. Every time we would fight I would watch porn, usually multiple times. She told me this killed her but it never seemed real when I watched it. I would always just play it off and think ""it's not a big deal, or well she's being mean to me so why should I care?"" It got to the point where she was saying that if I watched it again, our relationship would end. The fights got more and more frequent since she was so hurt by me watching porn from the last time we fought, and it eventually got to where we were fighting/I was watching porn every weekend. 

**The End:**
Now, I begged and pleaded and tried as hard as I could to do things that would help with my addiction, and after about 6 days she agreed. Then I went 2 weeks without watching porn, but then I start to feel unsatisfied again and I try to communicate this need to her but she can't bring herself to fool around with me because she's still heartbroken after this year long trend of pornography and fighting, along with other issues from her own life. so after two weeks, I watched porn. 7 times. She's done with me. She doesn't want to be friends, she doesn't want to be anything. I can't imagine my life without her. the first few days I tried to ignore it and just say that it would be like every other time, I've said this every single time I watched it

**Here's some steps I'm going to try to take:**

* Going to church, and I really miss it. I feel like when I go to church, and do the whole religious thing, which I won't get into here, it makes the biggest impact on my addiction. The problem is I get too lazy and stop doing them, which I need to stop doing.

* The next step is going to a local church's group for men to fight sexual temptation. basically a biblical support group. I've never gone as I've always been too embarrassed

* I need to get a hobby. I'm not really talented at anything, maybe that would take my mind off of sexual things. I recently started played Starcraft 2, but I'm pretty horrible and playing just makes me feel hopeless :/

* STOP MASTURBATING. I jack off at least once a day, and when I have nothing to satisfy it, it makes the fight against porn an uphill battle.

**Current Feelings:**
These are the current things I'm trying. Church is Sunday morning, I know they also hold them tuesday and wednesday, but I don't know if it's just a repeat of monday's  material. I've tried hobby searching before, so I guess I'll just continue that search. I haven't masturbated since the last time I watched porn, yesterday morning. I talked to my now ex yesterday after watching porn and she said to at least not talk to her until I've gone a month without doing anything sexual, but she thinks that even after that we won't get back together.  I've felt a little suicidal, although I know I could never actually do it, very aware of how much it will hurt everyone I know, and I don't want to be alone. I just want this girl back

I just want to say it is very very easy to get off on just simple fantasy/imagination (no using porn memories). I think it takes a minute or two on average to get off and it doesn't take aggressive stroking.
Today I ended up masturbating twice in the same day and I'm actually a bit surprised at how easy it is to get off without porn now.

Let me tell you, no matter how hard I tried.

The point I am trying to get across is once you accomplish the disconnect from porn masturbation can still be just as enjoyable and easy to do.

I think restricting masturbation in general is extremely helpful, so this can also help with that.

The key is self control and discipline; master your own body to improve your relationships with a SO.

1374345092.0,1ipghu,An Addictive Cycle,Soporus,11,0,5,"As someone who is battling addiction, but I ended up justifying relapses to myself.

I don't know if it is this way for others

Stage 1: Discontent.

In this stage, or the presence of something one wants to escape, be it stress or anxiety, causes oneself to weigh their options for a solution. This step is not unhealthy if it leads to something productive or non-destructive, but if it leads to one choosing porn (or whatever bad addiction) as the solution, it leads to stage 2.

Stage 2: Craving.

This is the stage at which one feels the desire to indulge in the addiction.

Stage 3: Planning.

In this stage, but can skip to stage 5.

Stage 4: Justifying.

This stage only occurs if one has any inkling of thought that the addiction is a problem. This is the stage in which one convinces themselves it's not a problem. Reasons I used included ""you were able to have an orgasm without porn, it won't do any damage,"" ""you wouldn't let yourself watch it every day anyway,"" and ""it feels good.""

Stage 5: Acting.

One acts on the addiction

Stage 6: Regretting.

After the moment of pleasure, vows never to do it again and/or beats themselves up over it.

Stage 7: Numbing. 

To remedy the bad feelings towards oneself, making it easier for a recurrence.

So when faced with these stages

Stage 1: Start with telling yourself that porn is not an option.

Stage 2: Go somewhere you cannot satisfy the craving, and/or remind yourself of what you hope to gain by quitting the addiction.

Stage 3: Remind yourself where you will end up if you go through with it

Stage 4: Remind yourself that absolutely nothing justifies watching porn. Remind yourself of how you're getting in the way of your goals

Stage 5: Remind yourself how fake what you're doing is, or whatever else motivates you to stop.

Stage 6: Immerse yourself in the regret. Let it hurt you. Feel bad about it. It's a regret for a reason. But remember you have goals

Stage 7: Like stage 6

1. Porn is disgusting (Child porn
2. Its a kind of social re-engineering. Societies that were modest and conservative
3. Child rapist when interviewed for a study said that they watched porn of disgusting type.
4. Normal sex life is destroyed if you watch porn.
5. Porn is anti-human behaviour. It is anti-sex.
6. It destroys mind, children, family, intimacy, ...
7. It destroys marriage.
8. It is racist.
9. People lose jobs
10. By watching porn you are supporting exploitation of sisters
11. It destroys you spiritually. 
12. We have to protect women in the whole of society and porn does just the opposite of that.
13. Porn is the end of masculinity.
14. It destroys intimacy and is all about masturbation and self satisfaction.

Just like your emotional/rational side agrees to MO on a certain day, your animalistic side needs to agree not to MO on other days. The ability to say no, not today is really important. I think planning out days in which you MO and sticking with that schedule is vital.

1) I watched it to see how the plight of the porn addict would be presented in a film. Regardless of tone (as I said, the movie does little to represent the real detriments of his addiction.

His recovery process is actually fairly well-represented at parts as it shows him jogging to fight his urge to touch himself and removing all porn from his household. The one thing they fall significantly short on though is motivation as he is quitting so that he can make a ""touching"" documentary to show a judge and get some leniency on his pending court case regarding his public masturbation. This rock bottom scenario not only does not feel realistic as I do not believe a reclusive porn addict would all of a sudden go so uncharacteristically exhibitionist

2) Along with the main character, only reluctant and celibate ones.

3) The biggest reason I do not recommend this film is for its content, but as the ridiculous plot unfolded, the adult content persisted steadily throughout. This directorial choice makes the film entirely unwatchable for an actual recovering porn addict.

I believe my downfall was pride.  I thought I could do this without a higher power.  I relied on the strength of my own arm.  I now realize how weak I really am.  

Gents, believe in something more than yourselves.  For those of us who have been through AA, we're taught to rely on a higher power.  Somehow, as a human, looking to a higher power gives us that added strength during our moments of weakness.

It's day one again.  For those of you who have relapsed, make grandiose promises of how you'll never do this again because (insert whatever reason you haven't used yet), and then start marching down the path of sobriety again.

I'm not going to make any grandiose promises.  I will, I'll tell you.  I'm accountable to all of you, and ask for your continued support as I dust myself off, readjust my game plan, get some spirituality back into my life, and start walking down that crooked road to recovery.

1363385729.0,1adkby,YoungPoseidon Starts His PornFree Journey (Male Married Mid 20's),YoungPoseidon,12,0,15,"I don't know where to start

First discovered porn at age 12 thanks to our trusty Windows PC.
Started fapping around age 13-14
Fap &amp; Repeat for years
Move away from home
Girlfriend and I move in together a year before we get married
Notice that sex life isn't anything how I imaged it. Figured it would go from 1-2 a week when we lived apart to 4+ a week when together.
Ignore problem by fapping and porn
In my mid 20's; get marreid
After being married a year
After viewing only 1 video of ""Your Brain On Porn""

So, I'm also looking to get your advice and tips as well.

One of the hardest parts for me, and luckily, it doesn't scare me. With what I've been dealing with over the last 2 years, I feel anything is better than what I'd been doing in the past.

It really starts for me when my girlfriend (now wife) and I moved in together. We had been dating for a number of years before moving in together and porn was never really an issue. In showing off my best side, like many girls her age, she didn't know the true extent at which I would use it. Everything from fapping most night to watching porn on my 21"" desktop screen while playing Call of Duty on my 32"" TV, side by side. It became a buddy of sorts; something I could do it keep myself entertained and not bored. It sounds silly to say, but I know I could tell you almost every bit of porn I had and what was on each video, photo collection, or comic.

When we moved in together after becoming  engaged, I could expect 4+ nights a week to keep me satisfied.

In the past, hoping that things will get better if I let things slide. I'm a very optimistic person, so I figured things would settle down and ""the fun"" would begin. Well, it never happened and I continued to use fapping &amp; porn as a way to numb the feelings I was having. The more I felt ignored, the more I fapped and looked at porn. My fiancé talked to me a few times about how she felt that porn was something she didn't like, and she didn't want to see. She acknowledge that it was something I did, but didn't want to see herself. With her input

We get married, once again nothing changes. Over the course of the next year, the following pattern starts to repeat: I am upset that I'm not getting the attention I feel I deserve, I go more into porn and make passive aggressive moves for her to see my anger. I change my computer desktop or phone to a topless girl (or some bikini model). She gets upset, and asks that I change it. I ignore her request and pretend to be above it all. She's hurt, I'm hurt. Being a great couple in everything else we do, we come back together again till the process repeats every few months. Each time, ""Never go to bed angry"")

During our repeating pattern, and usually only weekends. I think I can figure this out and invent a game for us to keep score of scoring. The idea was to move our sex life up to 3 times a week, usual this simple game, with incentives for her if she follows the rules. At the end of the 3 week ""game"", nothing changed much. I get throw out the game and ignore it by fapping and download another 20GB of new porn videos.

During this period

It only takes a week without sex for me to become passive aggressive with the wife. Once again, I start to feel empowered in a weird way about not getting sex. I feel the longer I have to wait for sex, the more I can hold over her head. Not in a way I mention it to her, more of a scorecard in my own head so I can justify being mad at her when I want to. Its an idea that she is getting worse and that by having less sex, I now have have proof i needed all along. In all the years leading up to our marriage, I only reject sex 1 time that I can remember. Since being married for over a year, I've done it maybe a handful of times.

With lots of changes in our life recently, it clicked. I decide to remove all my porn and stop myself from viewing it.

That was two weeks ago. I had never thought about fapping as being an issue as well, so did my desire to fap. In the two weeks since getting rid of all the porn, I've only fapped once. Even then, I kinda cheated and read an erotic story as an aid.

My goal when I threw away my porn was to try living without porn to see how things would get better. I'm hoping that the sex life will become something that i look forward to. No longer do I want to look at the wife and hide how I'm feeling or think of a way to avoid sex with her. As for now

That's is for now

I have been battling depression for a really long time, I haven't felt that black dog's presence in my life at all in the last two months. That suits me, not looking at porn is a fuck load cheaper than psychologists are. 

So I can tell you all here, but it does make the world much easier to deal with. I love not having anything to hide any more. I love waking up in the morning and having nothing to feel ashamed of. More to the point I can feel myself healing, and I'm pretty sure my DE has gone away (that part of the program hasn't gone to the testers yet, though beta testing is close on the horizon).

While I‘m writing this i‘ve been without PMO for exactly 10 days
The first seven days were much easier than I thought but today I had a really strong desire to go back to my favourite porn an get off on it. I reminded myself why I was doing the no PMO thing and decided to post my story here to help myself not to relapse.
I never considered myself to be porn addicted until I foudn r/pornfree which got me into thinking...
I started masturbation at the age of 12, at the age of 25 I need to while watching in order to get aroused. My tast in porn also changed a lot. It had to be extremer and new vids all the time. But not even that does the job anymore. The worst thing is how my sexual life sufferd from it.
I had my first girlfrind when I was 20. She was good looking and I liked her a lot. But i couldn‘t get hard when we tried to have sex. She left me 3 weeks later. My next girlfrind was one of the most beautiful females I ever saw but again took me very very long to get „him“ up. She left me 3 month later. My last girlfriend I had with 23. This was the worst ever. I took ages to get hard and when we finally had sex I came within a minute. Needless to say
For about two weeks I have new girlfriend. We met in an online-Community (themed Music)
I thought back at my other relationships and was very afraid
I already feel a lot better now. Today I had the first morning-wood in years! 
I get aroused just by talking with my gf on phone about how when it comes to the topic sex. And I feel attracted to normal women again. As I said, I won‘t go back anymore! I want to hold a real woman not porn! Thank you all very much! You helped my a lot!",,False,,t5_2rglh,False,month6,

It's damaged my health. It's sapped my motivation. And worst of all, I find it hard to enjoy simple things in life. I feel pathetic. I don't think there's any other word to describe it.

I'm trying to make it a month - one milestone at a time. I want to feel happiness and excitement from the little things in life. I'm not a slave to this manipulation of my impulses!

Seriously though ... this is just a rant and a self-Yeah to more than 7 weeks of a pornfree life! I am doing fine in general... finals are tomorrow and I will go to bed after this (CST). 

About two weeks ago I felt like it wasn't working out between a girl I was dating and I. So I told her we should cool things off before somebody got hurt. Which essentially would have happened because we had diverging ideas of our relationship and I wasn't really feeling ""it"". And no in case anyone wondered

So this is that. We've only been dating for 5 weeks. One of us found out that we were no match and everyone is fine. 
Until I meet this incredible girl in the study room.

She sat opposite of my friend and I. She smiled, hard-working, free to do whatever I wanted to. But suddenly: Decollete. A pair of the finest fruit I have seen for a long time. I don't want to seem like a perv! Though one simply could not just NOT take a glimpse every now and then. It was so bad my friend started to complain to me about the obvious distraction so we went for a walk. 

The memory of this afternoon just flashed before my eyes and I was about to ""take action"" on it. I am partly disgusted with myself. Partly I pitty myself for I might have let go of someone because she didn't have exactly what I was looking for. She was certainly okay looking. But no more than average. And the fact that I now miss her a little because I saw a great pair of boobs does not really help.

The fact that I can quantify a persons appearance and not be satisfied with it

1349726409.0,115jxi,Need some perspective from the guys at pornfree.,meannoharm,13,2,17,"Hi everyone

A few years ago I discovered my SO's porn collection because he left it open on his computer accidentally (I was not searching for it). After seeing tons of videos of orgies, I got weirded out. I held my feelings in for awhile, not wanting to be ""nagging"", but finally asked him about it when I realized it was affecting my attraction for him and comfort in our sex life.

He immediately told me that he would stop watching porn. Looking back I probably should have seen that this could backfire but I believed him. He ended up watching porn again very soon afterwards and lied to me about it for months. I tried to be understanding, not for himself. But he said he has always wanted to stop watching and this was just giving him the extra ""push"" he needed to stop watching.

Over the years this cycle keeps repeating. He says he won't watch it, I inevitably find out that he has been lying to my face about it and hiding it. He has had trouble getting it up from time to time due to porn use. He has gotten secret iPods and iPhones to do this without me knowing. At first I was just a little bothered by the porn. Now I am starting to feel genuinely betrayed. The lying is really bothering me.  He watches it whenever I am not home, I am pretty sure, but lies and says he doesn't.

It is causing a huge rift in our 5 year relationship. I feel like I can't trust anything he says anymore.

Pornfree, but it feels like he is betraying me.

Sorry if this is the wrong place to post

Also

**EDIT:** Thanks so much to those who have commented!  I agree with all of you guys that I really can't expect him to change ""for me"" because it won't work. It's not a strong enough motivator to overcome his addiction, I want him to know that it bothers me (to be honest with him) - on the other hand, I don't want him to feel like he's only making the change for me. So should I keep my feelings about it to myself?  For those who suggested different videos, that's a great idea, but I've already tried showing him some things like that. He says he knows that it has harmful consequences but he still wants to watch it anyway... is there no hope?

So, no fighting urges, etc. I waved the white flag and said enough. The concept of enough is enormously empowering. Also, I am truly and profoundly grateful for this change. If it is not permanent, then so be it. But it's been seven days since my last reset, and five of them have been truly pornfree, i.e. free from the desire for porn.

What happened? I mean, VHSs, magazines, whatever. 

So I read a couple of books - Out Of The Fog

Yet, worse and worse. 

SAA helped out quite a bit. It was the first time I've been able to tell my story to a roomful of people. Wept like an infant during parts of it. It was cathartic. But a schedule conflict has kept me away from meetings for over three months. So I don't think it's solely due to SAA.

The SAA book helped (the green one, I don't think they were the final triggers.

To the best of my knowledge here are the things that I think may have finally shot me up and out of the hole. 

**ONE**

*I've been reading a book on an unrelated subject (Your Money Or Your Life). I quote it below

**No shame
""Examining ourselves and our addiction to porn may bring feelings of self-criticism— even shame—to the surface. Here’s a way to work through those gently, but it’s really any simple word or phrase that embodies a particular attitude or attribute you want to focus on. A mantra is something that allows you to steer your mind away from danger and toward a clear, open horizon. A useful mantra for us is ""No shame, no blame.""

(OPs note: I also now use the word ""responsibility"". As in ""What's my current responsibility to myself

**Recrimination vs discrimination**
In choosing to change unwanted behavior, while discrimination sorts out the true from the false. Sinking into blame and shame slows your progress toward freedom. Recrimination immobilizes, demoralizes and distracts you. Discrimination, however, simply shines a bright light on potential pitfalls so that you can skirt them.

You may stumble repeatedly over the desire to blame yourself (or other people) based on what you learn. At those times, the hours you’ve spent on porn during your life represent just a number, not your number (OP's note: that time is gone, it's past, it's over). That figure is neither too much nor too little. It does not prove your worth or your unworthiness; it is not justification neither for despair because the time is gone, nor gloating because other people have ""worse"" addictions.

**Life Energy**
Viewing porn is something we choose to trade our life energy for. 
Repeat this because you may have missed its full significance: 
*PMO is something we choose to trade our life energy for.*

Our life energy is our allotment of time here on earth, is profound. 

This definition of time spent on porn gives us significant information. Our life energy is more real in our actual experience than porn. So, and it’s finite. Life energy is all we have. It is precious because it is limited and irretrievable and because our choices about how we use it express the meaning and purpose of our time here on Earth.""

**TWO**

**Confidence and Self-esteem meditation**
During the same time frame I was reading the above, lay down and closed my eyes, and listened and truly practiced the following guided meditation:
[Confidence and Self Esteem Meditation](http://thereisaway.podbean.com/mf/web/eybbh/confidence.mp3)
This is the web site I got it from: http://www.confidence.org.au/
The speaker's voices are somewhat accented, I didn't write, I just listened.

**THREE**

**The origin of suffering is attachment.**
Even though I didn't ""Get""  Buddhism

&gt;The origin of suffering is attachment to transient things and the ignorance thereof. Transient things do not only include the physical objects that surround us, passion, ardour, pursuit of wealth and prestige, striving for fame and popularity, or in short: craving and clinging. Because the objects of our attachment are transient, their loss is inevitable, because there is no abiding self. What we call ""self"" is just an imagined entity

[More information on the Four Noble Truths](http://www.thebigview.com/buddhism/fourtruths.html).

**Responsibility**
This isn't one of the things that flipped the switch off of porn. It's a result I think of the above concepts and ideas. I'm shouldering my responsibility to myself

Be well.

I couldn't. I tried every perverted, much less finish. But...after I finally left, horrified and embarrassed, I went straight home and ""performed"" perfectly. To porn. As long as I live, I will hate myself for that missed opportunity.

**But the good news:** a couple of nights ago (and exactly three weeks after I swore off porn), I realized that I was actually *in the moment*. I was thinking about, and being aroused by, the actual, real girl who was there. And that's the way our brains are *supposed* to work. It's not that we shouldn't get aroused by porn...it's that we should *also* get aroused by a real woman, and when that stops happening, there is definitely trouble.

It's probably been about a year now since I've started my pornfree journey

I just recently ended a week and a half long binge that had left me feeling at one of my lowest since I began this challenge last year. For the last eight or so years I used porn as an escape from my own inner demons, but my tastes soon began to delve much deeper. From the soft-core vanilla to urolagnia and eventually transgender and the like, it really was amazing how I could transition to things I was once revolted to. Not only was it just exploring deeper, it became a necessity in order to even get off. Thinking back I laugh at how ""normal"" porn had become so uninteresting that I literally had trouble keeping my eyes open late at night while watching it. However, some of the things I watched have really left me feeling shitty afterwards, and have even caused me to question my own sexuality at times.

It had really crippled what little self-esteem I had. I withdrew from friends and family and didn't even like going outside as I felt people could see how fucked up I was. I couldn't talk to anyone

I eventually reached a point during my first year of college where I had finally had enough and was ready to admit I had a problem. I was scary as hell, but to improve myself in general. Things like meeting with a therapist to help work through my struggles to just trying to get more active. The times where I am able to keep away from porn are some of the best days I have had in a long time. Just going out for a bike ride in the early morning or evening is an incredible experience. The small things like feeling the cool breeze in my face or watching the colors dance in the sky as the sun sets just make me feel so good inside. I feel so much more alive and at peace with everything. Social interaction comes much more naturally and I feel in a much better mood all the time. It's those feelings and experiences that help me get back up when I fall. It's what gives me the strength to continue to fight for my life back. I don't want to lose that again, not after seeing how amazing truly living can be!

While they are on I will *never* grow, while they are on I will *never* aspire to more than what I am, and while they are on I will *never* respect myself.

I want to stop wanting porn so that I can become the man I am not. I want to stop watching porn because I want to discover what it is like to be a man of integrity, god damn it. I want to be free of this stupid addiction which holds me back from becoming who I could be. I want to be free from these chains I put on myself, chains that I haven't taken off because I want them tighter. I have spent so long convincing myself that without my chains I would wither away into nothingness, forgetting that there was a time I could walk the halls of my own life without a desire to be held back.

1374467010.0,1isjbr,Here's what I've learned so far...,pfthrowaway0293,10,2,6,"This is a throwaway account

My story might be a little different from a lot of people who come here. I'm middle aged. I was into my twenties before I got cable internet. Before that, or if you were lucky, downloaded from usenet on a 14.4kbps modem. Nobody had huge GB of porn archives, and there were no browsers, let alone tabbed browsers you could fill with tabs and tabs of porn.

So I never had the issues that people here had. No ED. No escalating porn interests. No porn addiction induced social anxiety. I've had a ton of relationships, but porn hasn't really gotten in the way of any of them.

But I've still given pornfree a try.  Mostly because I was curious about what effect porn has had on me. I used to get off to porn on a nightly basis. I used to edge a lot. Sometimes it would interfere

I could have gone my whole life without questioning it, I've learned one invaluable thing:

PMO every night before bed isn't healthy.  Trying to find that ""perfect scene"" isn't healthy.  Having a huge porn archive isn't healthy.  Remember when people used to have one or two magazines or videos?  And only seriously dirty bastards had a garage full of porno?  Well

So now I try and abstain. Sometimes I'm successful, and I didn't think that was even possible at my age.  It's a great feeling.

So this is a message for people who PMO regularly,False,,t5_2rglh,False,,,t3_1isjbr

**My experience:**
I browse this subreddit regularly. If I hadn't found /r/nofap and /r/pornfree

After I found these subreddits

When I told him about them

It turns out that I was right.

He had a problem with PMO before we got together which he shared with me openly. He had a very very difficult childhood, he wasn't doing anything like that. 
He told me that he had gotten over his addiction

Moving forward

He thought that he could just stop
He fantasized about getting help from me, and that I would leave him.

When I got suspicious of his actions, and I asked enough questions over time for him to admit to me that he had masturbated and watched porn, and had been doing it for months. 

I was so hurt. NOT at the fact that he had masturbated

I am his partner. I am here to help him. 
I am not here to judge him. 
I want to help.

I won't lie, the trust can be earned back and a lot of respect has already been gained. I know he wasn't trying to hurt me, and that he was trying to protect me by hiding it. However, hiding it just made the situation worse.

My SO has become very open about his PMO addiction

His energy level is incredible because he is no longer suppressing all of this guilt inside of him. He is finding other outlets to release stress with. 

I am INCREDIBLY PROUD of him for telling me that he had a problem

**Basically
You don't need to hide this from your loved ones. 
This is an addiction
Guilt is normal

I know many of you are afraid to get your SO, but they will show their true colors when you ask for help. What you need in your lives now are positive people with supportive attitudes that want you to get through this. I may not be a fapstronaut, but I have struggled with addiction in my life also. If I hadn't gotten the support I knew I really needed, I wouldn't be where I am today.

You can do this. You can. Tell someone involved in your life that you are doing this


**If you are really afraid of what your SO would think:**
Show your SO this subreddit, and understand their perspective. 
As a woman (I don't mean to generalize women...), watching porn is sort of like infidelity. 
I understand the state of mind of a PMO addict now

A few years later

When I was 15 I had a lovely and beautiful 16yo girlfriend. She did some modeling and was very slim and youthful looking even for 16. I think these first sexual experiences imprinted on me, I find myself seeking out images of very young women. I look at these girls and imagine things similar to when my first GF and I were experimenting together.

I think that this has warped my sexuality over time. I find that even though I'm highly attracted to women my own age

First a bit about myself - I'm a 40-something who's been married about 10 years (happily) with a young daughter.  I've used pornography 3-7 days/week for most of my life since puberty.  I never really considered it wrong

After I got married, and so we can go two or three months without any sexual activity.  I convinced myself that this alone was a justification for getting my urges out in another way.  I would be happy to have no contact with porn, I said to myself, if she would have sex with me on a more regular basis.

While I do think that porn can desensitize you and rewire your brain in negative ways, and that is of the people in these movies or photos that you download. Perhaps there are some who do it because it is simply fun and they can disassociate the sex they have on camera completely from the intimate act they have with their SO.  I suppose some people simply don't have the wiring to view sex as anything but an athletic practice with a bit of a dopamine hit (over and above a normal athletic practice!).  But I think that probably there's a majority of people in the porn industry who are doing it to do additiction to drugs, abusive relationships, abusive childhoods, or even being coaxed into the industry by sex trafficers.  I've heard of such people luring 17-year-old girls from rural towns in the US, and that's in the US, where there are lots of laws and oversites about such stuff.  What about countries that are still really weak in terms of law and order and governence

In other words, as there are probably many who are doing it under duress, perhaps even sex slaves, who knows!

Having a young daughter certainly drives this home in a lot of ways, the fact that I still watched it I'm sure was still contributing.  Clicks mean some kind of revenue I'm sure, and just the fact that I was getting off, so to speak, on another human being's misfortune (not in all cases, but probably at least a good number if not most), is just as compelling a reason for me to stop as is for my own benefit or that of my relationship with my wife.

I'm wondering if this aspect of why to not use porn is something that others here contemplate?",,t5_2rglh,False,,month4,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/pornfree/comments/1by7v9/reasons_to_quit_besides_yourself_and_your_so/

I try to remember this saying when I think about why I'm staying porn free. Some days


Seems the most posts I hear on here about about guys relapsing and asking for advice. I figured talking about the progress would be more useful to facilitate more conversations I'm looking to have here. What are you goals? Why are you choosing to go PornFree? Seems like many people here use it as a tool to get out and start living the life they've always wanted. I've read many stories about being able to talk to women / girls that would never have happened before. 


Being scared to talk to women gets back at the idea that porn is the mental hunger that can't be filled. From my experience, and the girls I recommend you be with, that's not what you want. Easy girls make great fantasies, but horrible girlfriends and even worse wires. 


Looking back, after years of watching girls getting paid to be the ultimate male fantasy, had radically shaped how I interacted and what I expected from my wife. For me, I hope to remove the unrealistic expectations and sexual lifestyle that porn taught me was possible if only I had the right girl. 


Along this journey, keep me searching for a sustained enjoyment as I read the sexual exploits of supposed ""real life"" stories. Once again, I saw how reading these pages was giving me a false idea of what my life should be. So in the end, I've added them to the list of things which now make me PornFree. This may not be the same for you, but keep track of how your behavior is toward sites you may think are safe enough to handle.

I'm cleaning up my office today, wanting to seek out more pictures. I was able to control it after I saw it for what it was. This reminds me in a lot of ways of how it was to loose a lot of weight. Your brain is so programmed to follow certain functions, that you forget to say no to you when foods are offered. When the half naked model was sitting on the table, my brain went back into thinking about what else I could look at to make my heart rise. 

I came across a good definition of what being PornFree was about. Its about not purposefully seeking out explicit content

In my relationship with the wife (Married 18 months)
t cause a backlash that hurts me even more. 

I thought giving up porn would cause me to get worse in many ways I behave. I thought without that escape and release in my life, I kind of don't care. Not in the don't care thats actually is the passive aggressive silent treatment, some things that use to bother me don't change me emotional state like it use to. I count this as a victory. 

I continue to notice how much more perked up I become with anything sexual around me. If its a hot girl walking down the street in tight yoga pants, not the latest video on some site. I see this as healthy progress at least. I never thought or had the inclination that I would become a saint or sex-free.

I notice other things in my life slightly changing, but then recently again, I'm out like a light till morning. I seem to be sleeping just fine, once again, not sure if collated.

I always like to hear how your journey is going. Feel free to talk to me anytime.

1363550198.0,1ahaky,Guide 6: Habit Reformation (Power of 21!),neverforget_311,14,3,4,"Now I know this topic has been covered quite a bit

* **Habit Cycle**: I've said before that we are creature who seek out comfortable habits

* **Trigger**:Mental distress or depletion of willpower
* **Behavior/Response**: Temptation and rationalization why you should PMO.
* **Reward**: Allowing yourself to begin the **Hunt** (Intentionally looking at or seeking explicit content)

Now The reward of this habit Cycle triggers the next Habit Cycle.

* **Trigger**: The HUNT!
* **Behavior/Response**: Masturbation/Edging/Porn Binging.
* **Reward**: Orgasm and the pleasant realization of ""What the hell just happened...""

Now that you understand how the Habit Cycle works lets talk about how to reform it.

* **Habit Reformation**: Now once a habit has been form it is now a pathway in your brain that can never be undone, but I have a very compelling reason why you should never PMO again and I will talk about that in the next Guide. Now you need to readjust the first habit Cycle. I will give my personal habit reformation as an example.

* **Trigger**: Mental Distress
* **Behavior/Response**: Reflection in my journal/A Cold Shower/Willpower Booster: 10 min relaxation or nap.
* **Reward**: TV Show

Now I have found difficulty in trying to reform this habit, it requires no willpower &amp; has an instant reward even though it is a mere illusion that dissipates once your done. Once I have experienced mental distress or I am depleted, I feel like doing nothing or trying to skip to my reward &amp; watch TV. The problem with this is you need to disperse the built up energy/emotions through a different Behavior/Response before you enjoy your reward or it will just fester and get worse while your miserably sitting their watching TV. That being said don't binge on your reward enjoy it for the duration of the movie, TV episode, or Book/Comic Chapter and get back to living. Now you can mentally practice the reformation of your new habit by imagining yourself going through the Cycles and changing the behavior.

I have found success recently in a different approach to the PMO Habit. I recommend that you create a battle plan like I did as a final resort but then surround that particular habit with a barrier.

* **Habit Barrier (Mental Distress)**: Now in order to help with the difficulty of the reformation of a new habit I recommend first practicing your skill in forming new habits. Such as working out, ext. Now the idea behind this is not only are you getting better at forming new habits but you can surround yourself with a new set of habits that works as a barrier to the mental distress trigger. You see we are constantly seeking pleasure &amp; as a result of that we are interested in getting it as fast as we can (PMO Addiction.) But if you begin to a live a rewarding life &amp; you begin to fill your daily routine with Habits that are constantly making you feel good about yourself you won't need to get quick fixes of it through PMO or other addictions. Addictions give you an instant reward but it is short lived. A healthy habit on the other hand requires a lot of commitment and willpower to create, but once you have formed it, the investment you have made will be constantly paying you back in an abundance of fulfillment. With this new found sense of constant fulfillment you won't be seeking PMO Rewards because you have something much more rewarding. Next time you've had a tough day your subconscious response will be this new habit.

* **Habit Barrier (Willpower Depletion)**: Now my previous guides have addressed the subject on how to conserve &amp; increase Willpower
* &gt;""Pain comes from within

If you are constantly practicing this philosophy you will find yourself not so often drained of precious resources. Now reading &amp; knowing something are completely different from being able to apply it. Even though I experienced a relapse last week I never stopped trying to apply these principles to my life

* **The Power of 21**: To put it simply it takes on average 21 days (3 weeks) of consecutive effort to create a habit. At the same time it is recommend that you dedicate your willpower to one habit at a time until moving onto a next one. I recommend you write down a list of things that you wish to begin doing on a consecutive basis and put them in an order that you plan to follow. This list can consist of exercising, keeping a journal, ext.) Though I recommend you begin with exercising, it is the most important habit to form for fighting addictions. In order to form this habit you need to have it set in your mind that every day you wake up you are going to workout no matter what. Set a time that you wish to workout, if you are unable to meet your set time one day just let yourself know, you will do this before you go to bed and don't bother listening to your irrational thoughts trying to convince you out of it. Just remember if you can last 3 weeks it will be a habit and require less willpower to do. I have found great success with this and now I do my P90x workout everyday with ease I simply show up and press play. I am on the 4th week with not one day missed &amp; now I am committing my willpower to forming a 4 hour daily study session. Do not allow a relapse to interrupt your habit formations for they are going be one of the reasons you wont relapse again. Once you've worked out for 3 weeks begin to play an instrument or read a book 30 minutes a day while still continuity working out. You can begin multiple habits but only commit to one at a time, make it your mission to form that one habit at all cost.

* **Show UP!**: Starting a new habit will be difficult and will require you to get out of your comfort zone. The key to complete the 21 days is to just SHOW UP! If its working out just show up and complete the run or complete the workout video/regimen. It is not going to be fun and you are not going to be good at it but I guarantee you if you just keep showing up you will get better. Don't get discouraged and always complete the workout no matter what it takes. This is a matter of character &amp; we need to sculpt ourselves into one hell of a character.

One last note when you are doing this for the first time. When you wake up in the morning you are not going to feel like working out for all the wonderful reasons your irrational brain can think of

Fast forward through high-school, now grad school. There were times I'd use pornography for 12 hours straight, just viewing, opening up new tabs (what an invention, right?)---being unable to close them, and flitterring between each one back and forth back and forth. It was like an electric shock. The orgasm wasn't even the best part--and it signified the end of a fiending session.
I'd watch certain videos over and over
I see people with eating disorders talk about triggers. For me, bringing my laptop into the bathroom. I'd sneak out of my partner's bed and fake being sick just to masturbate. At work--well, smart phones. I'd think about it--what combination I could find next---Asian-Redhead-Naughty-Cheerleader-Gangbang-Space-Theme. It was like coming up with flavors of food and running home to taste them.
Not everyone who views pornography has this same response
I've avoided spending money on Porn--but only out of fear of having my creditcard tied to it and being found out. I was raised catholic and that sense of guilt and repression certainly has not abated (no offense to catholics

Webster's Dictionary defines Porn as:

Definition of PORNOGRAPHY

1
: the depiction of erotic behavior (as in pictures or writing) intended to cause sexual excitement
2
: material (as books or a photograph) that depicts erotic behavior and is intended to cause sexual excitement
3
: the depiction of acts in a sensational manner so as to arouse a quick intense emotional reaction &lt;the pornography of violence&gt;

But to me porn is more than just erotic behavior in pictures or video. The world says porn is the dirty magazines

Lust is looking or really the desiring of something that does not belong to us. Lust can be looking at a fully clothed good looking woman and saying

It all started when I used to go to a friend's house. He had just gotten satellite television, and then at my begging. I was a young teenager and those hormones were just firing up, so it was thrilling. 

I struggled with porn addiction all throughout high school. Knowing what I know now, Jesus loving boy that your momma would be proud for you to take home (which is what I was told by more than one mother), but deep inside I had this addiction.

Fast forward a bit. I struggled through college, but that could not overcome the rewiring I had done to my brain. I graduated with a degree in Religious Studies and was working at a church (such a hypocrite). 

I got married and laid off the same month. While I thought that marriage and the sex therein would solve my problems, fapping in bed while my wife was asleep, and I didn't give her near the quality or quantity of sex that she desired. 

My memory is trashed, and I have problems sleeping and “finishing”. I know that the only cure is pornfree. I hope you all can help keep me strong!

- Discovered porn while entering puberty (oh gawd)

- Went deeper even though I knew I could get caught

- Primetime was when I was home alone

- Discovered fappin soon after and just became a sprinkler

- Man did I ever fap in some of the weirdest locations

- Got quite severe acne and the causation is too obvious to ignore. Acne seemed to get not as worse if I stayed away.

- Got away from porn for a bit as I went through high school but fapping still occured quite a lot. Acne breakouts in the following days. Took Accutane to get the worst of it destroyed. I grew a backbone then I tell ya.

- Got my own laptop for college and that's when things really spun out of control. Im surprised my marks were as good as they were. If it was one thing that carried me through college it was my conscience to pace myself. Thats something that ive seen myself do during long streaks of NOPMO.

- Marks improved when I became an infrequentfrapper - but porn still had an affect.

- 6 years of work life suffered and my weak boundaries caused more domino problems. Work life improved and rich feelings washed back over my spirit when I really went for it.

- Triggers: Alcohol/ drunkPMO, Spontaneous Fantasies

- I feel porn is wrong in any dosage

- Got myself a gaming rig in summer 2011

I am in my early 30's and great up with dial up AOL and Compuserve. I got my first job in order to buy a computer. I saved up $1

Fast forward to college in the late 90's...T1 baby! The world of Napster, but we weren't having sex (for religious reasons... I'll come back to that later). I started developing stranger desires and fetishes. It was becoming a habit. 

All through college I had a computer in my room at the house I rented with friends. We had cable modem, and I had a hard drive full of porn.

I tried to quit but couldn't. It's like a drug! You NEED it. I got engaged (same girl as before) and thought it would stop once I got married. Let me tell you... It does NOT! It only gets worse. We were both virgins when we got married and I expected it to be like all the thousands of videos I had seen. I was disappointed.  I turned back to porn. 

It's been almost 10 years since I got married. And I'm still hooked. I'm ashamed and embarrassed. My wife doesn't even know. 

It's gotten so bad that I here off at work in the bathroom

It consumes me. I find myself chatting and looking up porn on my cell phone now (technology has made this addiction so much harder to beat). Every time I feel ashamed. I am embarrassed and I need help. I can't do this myself. 

This will not be popular here, but because I feel a responsibility to my religion to do so. 

But I need support. Physical and emotional support. 

Today I went on a purge. I deleted all my porn from my computer. I deleted Gmail accounts I used for chatting and websites. But my weakness is really my phone. It's literally right at my finger tips.

It's been one week since I've intentionally looked up porn to watch and masturbate to

Last night, but who am I fooling? We all know why I downloaded it. To tease myself. I deleted it without watching it, because I knew where that temptation will lead.

I'm not going to reset my badge, I think it's safe to say that I didn't pass that threshold of losing my mind in complete fantasy - which I feel is my real problem.

When I watch porn, and most importantly escape. I will use(abuse) porn in the same way many people (myself included) abuse alcohol or drugs. I've learned to use it to escape stress, depression, self-loathing, or ANY negative emotions I may be combating.

It is in this sense that I do not feel the need to reset my counter. It's the escapism this self-teasing will lead to that I'm trying to overcome, and choosing to continue to watch the number on my badge increase instead of opening a new tab and begin browsing pornhub.

I'm a young man in my mid-twenties, just got very lucky! I get to interact with politicians, academics, journalists from around the world- and more or less get to be a political and economic nerd all day long, get paid for it, and actually be surrounded by some of my intellectual idols. 

I have a wonderful social life, kind, and I'm generally liked by all. I'm constantly flattered with compliments on my charm and looks, even told by my CEO at meetings, ""that I come straight out of Tommy Hilfiger ad"" (although I guarantee you I do not have an ego, and actually I have rather low self-esteem). 

Objectively speaking

In part this steams from a relationship that I left almost a year ago. It was a sexless relationship. She was a virgin, until the day I found out that she had another boyfriend (who I thought was her ex-boyfriend, turned out she never broke up with him). She had been lying and manipulating me for over half a year - it was terribly devastating, to the point that i want into a solitary depression for a couple of months (the clincher - we also work at the same place, which makes life terrible at times). 

I'm not saying that this failed relationship lead me to over-excessive porn use. I know that I had already passed that point years earlier. I was fapping to porn on a daily bases. A good day was when I only fapped once. On most days it would be a least 3-5 times. I also started to watch increasingly more perverted porn - clearly the need to find something new and stimulating. I even end-ed up reading incest hentai doujin comics (don't have a sister, to see if they had new girls - constantly needing to find new stimulation. I realised it was getting bad, when I would be getting ready for work, and I would just fap to some porn - I was fapping, sitting in my suit at home, at the exact time that I should have been entering the office. I still got all my work done, and to a high caliber- but the fact that I was making porn a priority started to genuinely make me feel sick (in fact I am sick to my stomach just writing this right now). I finally broke down - when I was searching for porn that resembled my ex (who I never had sex with) as a need to find a virtual substitute. I can not tell you

Since the end of my destructive relationship, found me funny and enjoyable to be around. I felt like I was not living my life like I should be, because I was so ashamed of the person I am in private. On the exterior is this ostensibly nice, charming, and handsome young man - but who could barely keep eye contact with a girl (it requires all my strength to keep eye contact and not shy away when a cute girl looks at me). As a result, I do not see myself as a man, but as this little boy - who is still fapping like he was as a thirteen year old.

I did have a sexual encounter with a beautiful girl a couple months back. She was absolutely stunning. I was fine and erect during kissing and touching. Even during fellatio I was erect - but the feeling I had was for the most part numbness as she was down there. The only sensation I could feel was the pressure - none of the other wonderful things that come with it. When we started to have sex - I was numb beyond belief - I could not feel anything and eventually it became so difficult that I became flaccid. It was a depressingly terrible moment for me.

I realise that porn is taking over my life. I never thought it would get to this point -that I would be addicted to something like this. The thing is, and to be able to have intimate moments with her as we develop together. It may sound cheesy, but I am romantic at heart - and I want to be able to feel that, and not to disappoint someone because of an addiction. 

I genuinely believe that porn is leading me to a life where I will not be able to have a healthy relationship with anyone. Moreover, and co-workers have this image of a good wholesome boy and I just can't bare the darkness that I seem to be in.

Right... so I know I've been writing a great deal. I NEED HELP!. I don't know what to do about it. I've added a ""porn blocker"" on Firefox which works fine - I've deleted Internet explorer (not like I ever use it anyway). But I primarily use Chrome

But

I have a great life

I suppose like many addictions

But these things happen and big temptation now is to just go crazy for a few days

Porn is weird. Especially since I have been away from it for so long. It wasn't as sexy as I remember it. 

It has been great not using it for various reasons - mainly time not wasted and my approach to sex seems to be ""normalising"". But even after 113 days I felt porn may have been still an element in my mind when it came to sex. I didn't feel fully detached from it. I believe the ""90 day challenge"" is a good start. 

It had just been the last few days

Anyway

The Good news is this - I am currently pornfree again and I plan to be indefinitely

Keep fighting friends. I believe we are in it for the long run.

Anecdotally, my experience.

Last night I had a sex dream. It'd been 5 days since I'd seen porn, I thought I'd scratch that itch. And - here's the beauty of it - I could use my sex dream as fodder rather than porn memories. And I did. 

My desire to use porn tripled. I had to run errands, which is why I'm posting. 

My working theory is this: a masturbatory orgasm with porn (for some people, but not what my brain really needed. And so I leave myself a bit weaker than before (ironically, I really can scratch the soda itch with diet, but whatever).
