1364862530.0,1bh8rh,For one night of my life I had confidence. I can honestly say it was the best night of my life.,CorkyPal,184,16,35,"I am an 18 year old guy. I'm very shy

This saturday night I wen't to a concert, was opening for Stars. I brought one of my friends along to go see them. And met up with others later on. I wasn't expecting much other than some good music. I saw this really beautiful girl standing next to me. Normally I don't say anything to anyone. But I started up a conversation with her. I started talking to her about the band, she said she came to see Said the Whale too. Once the band played I started to dance, she joined in. After the Said the whale finished playing, I asked her if she'd like to dance again when the Stars start playing. She said told me she really wanted to and I asked her for her number so we could find each other again.

She put: ""Hot girl from concert ;)"" in my contacts.
Immediately I texted her saying: ""Hey

We had a good laugh and said we'd meet up after. At this point I was so pumped I couldn't believe I got a girls phone number. Thats never happened to me before. I was super excited. After hanging out with my friends for a while

She texted me and told me to hold up my phone so she could find me. We met up and she brought me over to her friends and introduced me. We spent most of the songs dancing. I had the confidence to take her hand and twirl her around a few times she was loving it and so was I. Then a slow song came on and I was really really really wanting to hold her hand. It was practically screaming in my mind. I didn't. So we danced a bit more and then another slow song came on. I thought to myself: ""Fuck it

We spent the rest of the concert dancing and holding hands.
I've never held a girls hand before. Hell

I don't know where the hell that burst of confidence came from

tl;dr - I got to hold a girls hand and i'm blooding fucking happy about it.",self,t5_2rmn5,1364864432.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/confidence/comments/1bh8rh/for_one_night_of_my_life_i_had_confidence_i_can/

Hopefully it will continue to grow! These are some of the things I did in order to build up my self esteem till I felt confident.

I've suffered with low self esteem for a long time, take it with a grain of salt and figure out what works best for you.

1) Erase negative self thinking. There are different causes of low self esteem, peers or teachers put you down at one point or for a very long time. The strange thing about that is that even if those people or events that caused you to doubt yourself are no longer in your life, you have internalised it. It doesn't matter what happened, because now you are your own negative reinforcer! So every time you hear yourself saying something negative, about yourself or anyone. Just stop. Stop the train of thought right there.

2) Promote positive self thinking. What is self confidence, but it helped her to stop uttering the phrase. Eventually she replaced it with ""I don't hate myself."" and then ""I like myself"" and then ""I love myself"".

3) Meditate. This one comes up a lot. [1] [1] [1] /r/meditation can probably help you in this area. Meditation teaches you how to focus and calm your mind. Get your mind to be a clam serene ocean as opposed to a wild storm. It doesn't have to be with candles

4) Start a journal of some type. I use an ordinary high school notebook, it helps big time. Its like a private therapist you are only privy to. For a long time my journal was filled with negative things I would say about myself. Slowly I started writing positive things, as I saw them. Acknowledging thoughts is important in regarding yourself as a person - you've got to acknowledge that you're a person that should be listened to. Writing things down makes them real. And you can track your progress.

5) Talk to people. Have you ever noticed that confident people make friends easily? Have you ever noticed that they can strike up a conversation with anyone? This is actually surprisingly simple! Talk to as many people as you can, but take a risk. Go out there, develop that confidence.

6) Treat others and yourself with respect. What you see in others is what you see in yourself. People who are really judgemental also put themselves to those unrealistic standards. Start accepting others, which I'm sure you've heard of. Give it a read, the worst that could happen is that you at least tried, the best thing that could happen is that it worked.

7) Keep moving. You can't always control your mind, do something that makes you happy, practice something that you're good at. Focus on it.

8) Exercise. If you want self confidence and a strong sense of self

Here are some VERY useful links

1) [The Mood Gym](http://moodgym.anu.edu.au/welcome) Conditioning positive self thinking and behaviour.

2) [Self Confidence](http://www.self-confidence.co.uk/) This is a 6 part email course

The most important thing to do is to keep trying. I'm 28 and only now do I feel confident, I should've done something or will you look back on it as the day you changed for the better? As I said, take everything I've said with a grain of salt and find what works best for you. Please feel free to add things to this list. Good luck :)

A final word, not just in relationships. Injecting confidence into your family, your work, your friendships and hobbies can only be a good thing.

1344047533.0,xnj8q,Some confidence tips,wahta,57,14,8,"Hello

I used to be very self-conscious. While I am still self-conscious to some degree

**Body Language**

* Get fit. Quite possibly the easiest way to gain confidence. If you're skinny, no soda), and exercise. Barring a medical condition, there is absolutely nothing stopping you from looking like [this](http://build-muscles.maxupdates.tv/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/Flat-Stomach-and-Ripped-Abs-a.jpg). Do you think that guy is confident? Truthfully, you have no idea what he thinks. However, he looks confident, and that's all that matters. A large portion of being confident is appearing confident. 

* Take up space. This can very easily be related to getting fit. Confident people take up space. If you're sitting down

* Always appear relaxed. Being confident is all about being in control. Tense people are very rarely in control. If you're out drinking

**Interactions**

* I listen to my iPod constantly. I used to have the habit of turning it off every time I passed someone, nod, say 'hi', and move on. Don't put too much thought into passing greetings. If you're listening to music, ignore them completely until they've actually addressed you. Then, take out your earphones, ask them to repeat themselves, and don't be afraid to ask people to repeat themselves. I realize these examples are specific but I believe they are common.

* Understand that everyone has a mind similar to yours. People may say things they regret. The incredible-looking, the short, stilted, uninterested response you provided. The truth is that everyone thinks, and no one is so self-confident that they don't question their own actions on occasion. This is an important realization. Even the most beautiful girl may feel rejected by the ugliest man. Knowing how your own responses affect others is a useful and learnable skill. My only request is that, upon learning this skill, you do not use it to abuse others. Most people depend heavily on human interaction

* Don't complain. Nearly everyone will have at least one consistent problem in their life. Maybe your knees are fucked up. Maybe you have migraines. Maybe your family is shitty. Whatever. As important as these issues are

**Personal**

* Don't get angry. Remain relaxed and in charge in all situations. If you encounter a problem, flips his shit, complains, yells at his GPS, swears at other drives, and generally appears childish. My brother, upon missing a turn, gets in the next turning lane

* Get over it. Fucked up a conversation with that hot girl in your class? Get over it. Had an awkward greeting with a coworker? Get over it. Give yourself a brief period of analysis for every negative interaction you have. Look at what you did wrong, when I was fairly unhappy. 1) Every emotion is contained in my consciousness. 2) I have partial control over my consciousness. 3) I can influence my emotions to a certain degree. Learn to reject negative feelings and accept positive ones. Don't let yourself fall into that self-pity that feels so strangely good -- it is ultimately dangerous. Become an optimist.

* Push yourself. Talk to everyone you can. Work out until you can't work out any longer. If you see a possible area of self-improvement

A few important points: 
Certain advice above may not work for you. Don't get discouraged. Everyone thinks differently. Just because you don't fit one definition of a stereotypically confident person does not mean that you aren't confident. 
Confidence is cyclical -- the more confident you become

I feel like I could write about these topics forever. Realize that your potential is not limited. Realize that you are in control of your brain. Realize that your current confidence level is not indicative of your future confidence self.

I know this picture is currently on the front page. I saw it there. I don't know how to ""x post"" or whatever. Anyways. I read that quote and it blew my mind. I grew up in an extremely christian home, and I come across as a confident alphamale but on the inside I have basically no confidence. As I said, I put on a great show; along with my 6'5"" muscular frame, it's pretty easy for anyone else who sees me or interacts with me to believe that show. I now go to a public university and am no longer a Christian - I don't think (it's so much harder than you think to stop believing that nonsense after being brainwashed with it for 20 years). I think I'm agnostic, but I don't know. I don't want to go as far as say I'm atheist. 

ANYWAYS, anywhere from overhearing some random person say it to hearing it said in movies. It wasn't until just now that it hit me, and it hit me like a bus. 

There is no higher power. IF there is

It finally hit me that none of that crap exists. I am my own God. I am my own creator. I am everything that I have done and everything that I will ever do and it's all up to me and nothing else. There's nothing holding on to me or playing puppet with my actions. I have to be the one to make my own decisions for me and for what I want. This just makes me so much more confident for some reason. I almost feel free. I do feel free. I think I feel free. I'm still trying to climb out of my deep deep canyon of brainwash. But I feel more free and hope that I can continue to feel more and more free.

3. Caring about what other people think, not selfish people.

7. A BIG ONE FOR ME: Nothing about me or what I do is real unless other people say it's real too. The Talmud says ""If one man says you are a donkey, it's not real.

11. If I give myself self-approval (assuming that's even possible) I will be even more isolated than I already occasionally feel. 
12. Whatever I say about getting approval from people in general goes double for getting approval from attractive women.

13. Even when girls have told me they think I am worthwhile

Not too long ago I was giving a guy advice on here who asked what to do if he tried to kiss a girl who wasn’t being responsive. I gave a piece of advice regarding confidence that was basically “fake it till you make it.” I thought this was great advice that I was sharing with this fellow in need, after all, when I come on here I try and find quick fixes to my problems, even though those really don’t exist, and I wanted to find a way to really help out.

That was a couple weeks ago, did my laundry and planned on getting a haircut later in the day.

Before my cut I decided to check out reddit and stumbled on this really insightful TED talk which discussed the importance of stretching and making yourself feel big and its effect on one’s self confidence as well as how big of an impact straightening your posture can have. Being someone who is always looking to be as confident possible (I often go out to bars with my pals and we all try and pick up girls, I’m doing my best to keep a good posture which can be tough for me at times since I have a bit of scoliosis.

Anyways fast forward a bit more and I’m walking over to the barber shop, right? First you need to hit the courts on your own and practice when no one's around. Confidence is exactly the same thing. I found that since I get a little bit of nerves when I approach beautiful girls that I should first try on something a little easier.

I made the resolution today that I would talk to just about anyone I could and get comfortable. Situations where I would normally not speak to someone because I don’t have to are perfect. They’re no pressure

As I finished this brilliant train of thought I had arrived to the barber, not to mention that I was looking great after getting a great haircut.

So that’s my newest resolution, people sitting next to me in a lecture hall, door to door salesmen whatever. If I don’t have to speak to them it’s even better because no pressure is on me and in the event things start going south or I lose my cool I can just bail, no harm, no foul. After a little while I’ll have gotten so good at chatting people up that models and actresses could be ordering drinks at the bar and I’ll be able to approach them without getting phased whatsoever (I hope).

So that’s what I discovered today

Self-confidence has always been an elusive concept to me. Before I delve into that

Growing up, my parents, my teachers, and the ones at church. I didn’t trust a lot of their intentions, or what they meant by their attempts to offer perspective. That being said, I was still a very a thoughtful and contemplative kid. It was religion really, which I saw as an unfulfilling comfort for adults such as my parents, but always talked of it and life in a way that seemed like she was trying to convince herself as well, that my parents are very nice people. They were good parents, and failed in a lot of in my formative years. My mother was overbearing and my father was apathetic and probably couldn’t relate to me (a common situation

Nevertheless

The weird thing is, musical, artistic, and good with kids. Lots of beautiful women, who I think would generally be rated as 10’s, approach me or look my way. Unfortunately, my lack of confidence has kept me from having the guts to talk to these women or even see myself under a positive light.

One time, and she was beautiful, after a few days of chatting she gave me her number and she told me to call her some time, the days went by and days turned into weeks the same way, saying not today maybe tomorrow, it got to a point where I guess she got tired of waiting and deleted me from Facebook. Even though I knew she liked me and I liked her I kept on finding excuses not to call her and now all i do is regret it.

Also, just tonight I was at a get together at this girls house (FYI: my friend (who is a guy) invited me to this) and somewhere through this course of events my friends got this fat girl to ask me if I wanted her to suck my dick, and I was not attracted to her in the slightest, but I got so nervous that I started slurring my words and talking really quite, and I could not control it, and even though I didn't like her just the fact of her being a girl and talking about blowing me got me all nervous.

It kills me to ask others for help, and I moved home. The college I'm going to now is a community college which is cheaper, but I'm still continually putting myself in debt, unfortunately (thankfully 80% of my units transferred or I'd be screwed). Ever since I moved back home I've been looking for work; with any luck I'll find something in the next two or three months (it's been six months already). To make matters worse, I have bipolar disorder, for which I've been medicated for the past two years. That in itself increases my stress and anxiety exponentially.

I have NO GODDAMNED IDEA how to convey to others, to even tell my parents that I'm this vulnerable, would put serious pressure on them and I can't bear to do that. It's bad enough they've had to deal with my bipolar disorder, my transsexuality and the subsequent breakdowns I've had over the past six months as it is.

But to be honest, this constant juggling of fiances, this continual struggle while those around me seem to be able to handle the real world effortlessly. It's too much to swallow all at once. I don't get how people can do it so easily.

- Exercise: This is typical for a confidence booster. I've put off weights a long time ago because I looked at it like a burden. Couple months ago I finally said to myself that I will be more dedicated to the iron, and then if you feel confident enough, step it up to 30 minutes and so on.

- Make music or take up an art form: Everyone loves music, I happened across Fruity Loops and is possibly the best $100 I ever spent on anything. There's a certain feel of accomplishment you get when you find a sound that...well...sounds good, and putting it in a beat that you can tap your foot to. The best part is that YOU made it! Now, I'm still a noob at it but that doesn't mean there's no room for improvement and to have fun as well ;)
The same can be said for any other kind of music or instrument you're into. Whether your a rock guitarist who wants to make tasty riffs or a singer who wants to nail that high note, it helps to have a hobby that you want to excel at and keeps you busy.

- Procastinating is normal for everyone, I just put it off for later  and say ""bleh I'll get this done eventually"". I barely passed that semester and failed 1 class (philosophy). It was when my 2nd semester came around and I started to realize how much better this was then high school and there were a bunch of ways to improve myself more, knowledge and work-efficient wise. I decided that I'm going to be doing the necessary reading and work that needs to be done ASAP more seriously. Thanks to actual studying, not only do I pass my tests and quizzes, but I know some of my material inside-out. It's also nice to lend a hand to a fellow student who needs help. 

Like I said before, not a great musician, and sometimes school can be pressuring. But minor improvements are good improvements. I gain a little bit more muscle now and then, I still get that accomplishment high when I make a sound I dig, and as long as I work hard then school will go great. I knew I was a little bit more confident when I was talking to a girl at school, and I'm usually nervous as hell around women! But this time, I actually got to look her in the eyes and be myself. It's little things like that that show improvement in self-confidence.

Hope this helps for anyone who reads it. This is a good idea for a sub-reddit and would like to see it grow more!
