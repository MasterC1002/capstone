I had never sat down and watched an actual anime before and upon a recommendation from a friend decided to give Cowboy Bebop a shot at 1:00 in the morning a couple of nights ago. Boy was that a good move. Stayed up till 5 AM that night completely glued to my computer screen.

Everything about this show was amazing. The universe, the music. As a Jazz musician and fan all I can say is holy shit. Whoever wrote this soundtrack is now one of my favorite people.

Fellow bounty hunters Spike Spiegel and Jet Black head to the Tijuana asteroid colony on their ship, who is wanted for killing members of his own crime syndicate and for stealing a cache of a dangerous combat drug called Bloody-Eye. Asimov and his girlfriend, Katerina, are ambushed at a bar by his former syndicate while attempting to sell a vial of Bloody-Eye, but Asimov manages to fight his way out by using the drug himself. Later, Spike comes across Katerina and reveals to her that he is a bounty hunter searching for Asimov; Spike is promptly assaulted by Asimov and is nearly killed before Katerina intervenes, though he is able to steal Asimov's Bloody-Eye vial before the two leave. Spike confronts Asimov at a staged drug deal with the stolen vial, Asimov attempts to take another dose of Bloody-Eye

But I need your help!

I've never done one of these before and it's becoming clear that there are a number of different ways we can do this.  For example:
 
* One episode a day for 26 days with one extra for the movie and we discuss throughout the day
* One episode a week and we watch it together in real time and discuss while watching
* Etc.

It all depends on what works best for the community so I want to hear your opinions! And of course upvote whatever works best for you.

*Setting up a Conflicted Work* 


In a series known for its juxtaposition of conflicting styles and bounty of anachronisms (visual, and musical), much like the later Samurai Champloo, the first we hear of Cowboy Bebop—“Memory,” I believe--can only be described as akin to a music box—soft, gentle, something we’d want to go to sleep to. But combined with the visuals of the church shootout (at this point a mystery to us), but within the first 45 seconds we are immersed in contradictions at their basest forms: sight and sound. This

The conflicting styles continue as the opening pops onto the screen—“Tank!” is loud and thumpy to contrast brilliantly with the music-box from before. This time, drained church shootout scene we just watched (reminiscent, I thought, of the visual style in Schindler’s List) it’s colorful and just kind of pops out at you. After that we get another song—this time with a harmonica as its foundation. I never really noticed it until now, but for the first three minutes of the episode, we are never without music. Then it breaks with Jet’s voice. By now, we’ve had three totally different styles of music paired with three totally different visual styles: “Memory” with the bleak shootout; “Tank!” with the poppy opening; and “Spokey Dokey” with a very Westernesque view of Mars. And we’re only three minutes in. 

This

As the episode progresses, for that matter—other than that he’s a dangerous type, they’re low on food, and that the two of them have clearly gone after baddies for long enough so that it’s just another job. 

Following this, not what you’d expect from a show that—at this point—is set up very much to be a sci-fi. It’s very clearly a Western kind of style. The older folk we see in the bar are exactly the kind of people you’d expect to see in a saloon in the old West. Then, right around the seven-minute mark, we see Asimov and whats-her-face for the first time. Right there, we get another contradiction—this time in age, demeanor, what have you. The old men are just sitting around playing cards, crabby, but he presents himself far differently than the older men. 

As soon as the exchange of bloody-eye is initiated, and we are finally introduced to Bebop’s distinct method of presenting action scenes. But, of course, we all know about that. 

Throughout the rest of the episode, until the final exchange between Spike and Asimov. Personally, the fight scene set to “Rush” is my favorite in the entire series: it’s smooth, loud, but most of all it’s where the music and the action for which Bebop is so celebrated finally come together. 

Then there’s that transition into the ship chase set to very different music than “Rush” and we see the somewhat tragic end to Asimov and his lover: Adios. Then we get back to “Spokey Dokey” to round it all out

Though not as much as the later Samurai Champloo, crime, suspense, but even more, it’s about the sometimes subtle fusion of sound and sight. It’s fascinating, I think, to see just how much the juxtaposition of conflicting styles really sets up the show to be something different. From its outset

***Spoiler warning: Plot and/or ending details follow.***

Synopsis from [Bebopedia](http://cowboybebop.wikia.com/wiki/Sympathy_For_The_Devil): 
 
Spike has a flash-back that he is being operated on by surgeons in a room where human organs and a fish float in water-filled tubes. He wakes up in a nightclub where a kid is on stage playing a blues tune on a harmonica.
  
Faye inspects the refrigerator on board the Bebop and finds only a can of dog food. Ein is waiting by his food dish but Faye instead eats the dog food herself.
 
Jet and Spike are at the nightclub talking about blues music. Spike uses his computer glasses to identify their three million Woolong bounty head, from the night club enter a taxi with an old man in the wheelchair, Zebra. Spike follows Giraffe, who followed the taxi to a sky rise hotel. Giraffe enters a suite and goes crashing through the window to the ground.
 
Spike
 
Back at the Bebop Jet and Spike talk about selling the ring. Jet goes to lunch with his old friend
 
Fatty River explains:
Ten years ago they had a confrontation with some space raiders. A land dispute. It all came down at some R&amp;D facility near Mars. A few days later the raiders are wiped out, Zebra turns up in a wheelchair with the kid. Guess it didn't turn out the way he planned.
 
Spike goes back to the nightclub and follows Wen and Zebra after the show to a warehouse. Jet and Faye find Wen in an old newspaper article from 30 years ago where he looks the same age.
 
Wen takes the high ground and fires at Spike. A flashback of Wen’s childhood show him with his family on a terra-formed Moon when the hyperspace gate crashes and annihilates the environment. Wen

Wen explains to Spike that he stopped ageing and captured Zebra when he hit the R&amp;D lab. He then asks for the ring and when Spike plays dumb
 
Spike hits Wen in the face and knocks him down a floor but Wen escapes.Spike returns to the Bebop with Zebra who has tears in his eyes but is otherwise paralyzed. They use a brain scanning machine called the Alfa Catch to record his memories as video images. They witness how Giraffe got shot at by Wen in the hotel room. Giraffe explains that the stone can return ageing to Wen—the only thing that can kill him now.
 
Jet explains:
When the gate exploded
 
Jet crafts a bullet out of the gem and Spike loads it into a Thompson Center Contender. Spike goes to leave but Faye is worried he won’t come back.
 
Spike flies his Swordfish II and tracks Wen in a stolen taxicab. They travel away from town and Spike shoots at the taxi
 
Wen fires three shots with a sadistic smile on his face: one lands at Spikes feet
 
Spike shoots Wen between the eyes, saying he finally feels at ease. With his last breath, he asks Spike if he understands.
 
Spike replies ""Yeah, points at it with his finger and says ""Bang"".

Edward's Dad is VT's Husband


Compare Urel and VT's picks in Heavy Metal Queen at 22:05 to Ed's dad in Hard Luck Woman at 15:28. Similar?

Doesn't young VT in the photo at 22:05 look a lot like Edward?


In Heavy Metal Queen VT says Urel was the only other person who liked drinking a Prairie Oyster. Guess who loves eggs as well? Loves them enough to carry around a full basket of them.


What would be some qualifications to be the most legendary bounty hunter? You would probably have to be able to beat people up like a boss right? Who throws Spike around like a rag doll in Hard Luck Woman? Ed's Dad.


Wikipedia keeps saying that Spike guesses VTs name and that it sounds like Ed's last name


Anyway, and most importantly, Ed's dad being able to beat up Spike, I feel like this is a definite yes. And the egg thing I guess. Also seeing as how Ed's dad's name is known to translate roughly into Turkish as ""Excuse me, check please"" I feel like it's another clue in showing that he's not all that he seems to be.


So why does VT think Urel is dead


Here's a 3 o clock theory for you:

VT and UT have a child and decide to stop bounty hunting. UT's past catches up, and slight anterograde amnesia. He does not really remember his past, or chooses not to accept it, and he quickly forgets anything in his present.


VT becomes a truck driver to make money, but not being able to deal with a child by herself.


Ed, follows her parents along on her computer, and once VT comes into contact with the Bebop crew becomes very interested in Bebop. She garners strength from their tribulations, and decides to run away. And when they come to Earth, she joins them.


Over the series and movie she slowly gains more and more strength as she lives with the dysfunctional Bebop family and finally decides to meet her father who can't remember her. Which is way easier than trying to meet her mom who chooses not to deal with her or her father... In her mind she hopes that she can catch her dad

Original Airdate: November 21


Synopsis from [Bebopedia](http://cowboybebop.wikia.com/wiki/Ballad_of_Fallen_Angels):   

***Spoiler warning: Plot and/or ending details follow.***
 
Mao Yenrai, a member of the Red Dragon syndicate, and his henchmen kill Carlos in his ship by causing it to explode as he leaves the meeting. Vicious then uses a sword, his weapon of choice, to kill Mao Yenrai who intimates that Spike could have prevented this.
 
Jet and Spike find a new 28 million Woolong bounty is placed on Mao Yenrai for an unknown crime. Spike is ready to go after a lead they have but Jet is worried about the bounty and thinks Spike is hiding something he knows about Mao. Spike asks Jet how he lost his arm and Jet asks what that has to do with their conversation.
 
Faye arrives from shopping and tries to join the conversation but is told to stay out of their business. Spike leaves in his Swordfish II. Jet leaves the room as a video signal comes into the computer with a new lead on the bounty
 
The lead takes Faye to an opera house where she can find Mao Yenrai at his box seat. She is dressed for the formal occasion
 
Spike goes to see Annie
 
Faye is invited into Mao Yenrai's opera box at gunpoint by Vicious' henchmen. They know her name and tell her to sit through the opera performance next to Mao's body that has been propped up in a seat.
 
Annie gives Spike a gun and bullets but asks him not to get tangled up with Vicious again. She regrets that Spike is a show-off and never listens to anyone. Back on the Bebop
 
Faye calls in to the computer's video phone to ask them to rescue her from Vicious. Spike goes, Spike meets Vicious and kills the henchman holding Faye at gunpoint. A mob of henchmen appear from hiding places and start to fire. Spike kills several people and races upstairs towards Vicious.
 
On a balcony next to a large stained-glass window Spike and Vicious duel with gun and sword respectively. They both draw blood and Vicious manages to grab Spike by the face and throw him through the window. Spike falls to the ground and a montage of his former life flashes before his eyes.
 
The images speak without context but show Spike fighting alongside Vicious; Vicious in bed with Julia
 
Spike then recalls a memory where he is recovering from injuries at Julia's place and she is humming. Spike is awoken from the dream by Faye humming

***Spoiler warning: Plot and/or ending details follow.***

Synopsis from [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Cowboy_Bebop_episodes): 
  
The crew of the Bebop chase a bounty named Decker, who hates bounty hunters, but ends up lending him a hand.
  
The character Otto was modeled after the character portrayed by Bunta Suguhara in Trucker Yarō (""Trucker Guys""), Sneaky Snake, and Spider Mike, originate from the 1978 film Convoy. The line ""Breaker One-Nine,"" stated in the episode by the character Victoria Terpsischore (V.T.), also originates from Convoy, though it is an actual term used by truckers, and ""One-Nine"" being the East-West bound travel in North America

As far as actors go for a live action Cowboy Bebop, who are believable actors you feel could capture the actual personalities and feel of the characters from the series as opposed to simply looking like them?",SgtPepper00,26,11

Ideally, big curly hair, deep pronounced voice, and we know he can definitely get into the mind of his characters. (His character in 10 things I hate about you was also a pretty ""cool"" character derivation from Spike). 

However, and is undoubtedly a draw at the box office, (also can really capture the young woman demographic.) While I don't think Spike has ever been personified perfectly by any of Ryan Gosling's roles, he is definitely close enough to what I feel Spike could be for a live action movie, and with some subtle tweaking (namely during more light hearted scenes or his general ""disinterested-ness"") Ryan Gosling could be a very solid choice for Spike.

=============================

___________________


* **Jet Black**

This one was pretty tough, I definitely see him as a more of a caring father figure ultimately for the rest of the Bebop crew. I definitely feel Laurence can capture this strong, powerful character with a somewhat broken past, however has still chosen a life of good. Not only that, his voice can match Jet's as well (I always thought Jet had very Black American sensibilities about him, while not being too stereotypical of black men in film/animation.) If not Laurence, I would probably choose Jeff Bridges

=============================

___________________


* **Faye Valentine**

DKR SPOILERS

Ideally, she is also brazenly confident (still not without her soft spots however). These are both seen in Anne Hathaway's portrayal of Catwoman in DKR and in Faye's in Cowboy Bebop. Anne Hathaway is [brilliantly manipulative in this scene](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAzXwlmQ0b4), as she uses her sexuality as a tool to gain what she wants, however is still willing to get very physical (much as Faye has done throughout the series). Additionally, Anne is very deceiving of the main characters throughout the movie (as she needs to ""get hers""), while still ultimately being on their side at the end, very similar to Faye as well. Both characters also pretend to be unattached from our main characters although they really have feelings for them (whether they be romantic or not). 

=============================

___________________


* **Ed**

I honestly have no idea who could play Ed, and this would only be exacerbated by real life actors. I don't think I've seen a very similar character to Ed portrayed in any live action movie I've seen, so it would be difficult to choose an actress. Ultimately, I would prefer someone young (in the 12-16 range), who can act comfortably silly. I think the most important aspect of Ed's character is how other characters react to her in the series, as they would have to be generally indifferent towards her crazy antics, even if she does things way out of social norms. Characters could also potentially have a line or two talking about her behavior

Ex: ""Does she always act like this?""
""Kids.""
or something.

To the matter at hand: I think Spike is, Faye, Ed, every bounty they come across and every challenge the crew faces are separate elements of his subconscious that Spike's mind creates to occupy him while he dreams away, trapped in his own brain activity before he finally defeats his inner demon, Vicious, and is released to the higher realm that Laughing Bull speaks of every time he watches a star fall (see: Gren's death where Laughing Bull calls the shooting star: &gt;'...a lost soul who has finished his battles somewhere on this planet.

**Session 2: Stray Dog Strut**

*Wild Wild West*

To the untrained eyes and ears, cartoonish expressions, and over-the-top action sequences. People tend to think of the Big Three (for the uninitiated, those are Naruto, One Piece and Bleach). They don’t think of anime as having western influences or themes. As far as I know, Bebop was one of the first anime that very much so had a Western feel to it. You had contemporary shows like Trigun that rivaled Bebop as far as “being Western” was concerned, but it really was Bebop that came onto the scene and became the really definitive “western” anime. As a result

“Stray Dog Strut” really sets Bebop up as Western in both tone and influence. By this, it is Western in that its overall style (music, action, characters) are all very Americanized. But once again, more on that later.

It may seem like a pretty obvious observation, representing the Old West, whereas the “bebop” signifies the jazzy, American spin put on it. 

Regarding the episode at hand, that’s just a little observation. 

There were two primary observations I made throughout the episode regarding the Western style. As previously mentioned,” we have Jet, Spike, Asimov, his lover (still don’t know her name…), the bartender/drug dealer, and the trio of grizzled old dudes. Here, Jet, the bug-drinking guy in the bar, the bickering truck guys (one of whom reminds me of Ravi from Planetes)

Most of these are one-scene characters, Jet and Punch &amp; Judy, we don’t see most of them again. The point I’m trying to make with regards to the unusual number of speaking characters is that it contrasts with the typical cast of a Western. Going off my knowledge of Old Western films, there’s the typical lone wanderer, perhaps his sidekick, a damsel in distress, maybe some Indians or train robbers, my knowledge of Old Western films is fairly limited. Anyway

The second was, this time in tone. Whereas “Asteroid Blues” was at all times either dark or action-packed, “Stray Dog Strut” was much more light-hearted. That is to say, it’s not just more light-hearted in terms of dialogue or characters; the colors and visual style of every scene is so much brighter, so much more alive than in “Asteroid Blues.” But where the humor really comes into play is in the context of the series as a whole. There are dark episodes of Bebop (see: “Ballad of Fallen Angels”) and there are very light-hearted episodes of Bebop (see: this one) and there are just plain weird episodes of Bebop (see: “Pierrot le Fou,” “Toys in the Attic”).

Where it conflicts with the series’ Western roots is the fact that Bebop so well balances its humor with action

Without it sounding too much like a review
