* WIN-1 to 7 (for the programs located on my taskbar)
* ALT-F4 (for closing programs that are on the foreground)
* CTRL-W (for closing tabs in my browser (Chrome in my instance)
* CTRL-TAB(for toggling between full screen and maximized mode in Mediaplayer Classis)
* ENTER(for pressing ""enter"" obviously :) )
* WIN(for opening my start-menu

Macro placement (on side buttons 1-12):

* -1 to 7 = WIN-1 to 7
* -8 = ALT-F4
* -9 = CTRL-W
* -10 = CTRL-TAB
* -11 = ENTER
* -12 = WIN

Reasons for some of the button placement:

* -7 &amp; 10 (The seventh program on my taskbar is Mediaplayer Classic
* -8 &amp; 9 (Because they're both macrod to close something it's easy to remember without looking.)
* -8 &amp; 11 (Sometimes when you close a program you get a message which asks if you are sure you want to close the program

For me

I hope this will bring you some ideas of your own

&gt;We've had some feedback from customers who placed their pre-orders for the Razer Blade and have not received their order despite the fact we've already started shipping and I've looked into the situation. 
&gt;
&gt;Our launch pre-orders are taken and processed on a First-In-First-Out (FIFO) basis but as our launch inventory is spread out in distribution centers throughout North America – the more popular DCs are depleted of stock faster than some of the other DCs – so if you’re based in the range of a DC with a lot of pre-orders
&gt;
&gt;If you're one of the affected parties
&gt;
&gt;Again - this is only for customers who placed their pre-orders and have not received their order and we apologize for this as the demand has just been incredible for the new Razer Blade. 
&gt;
&gt;This situation only applies to launch quantities as our follow up shipments from the main warehouse are done on a as-demand basis and we should be able to catch up to committed shipment dates shortly.
&gt;
&gt;We apologize for the inconvenience and we hope to address it as soon as possible.

* The thin metal connecting the thumb piece to the mainbody causes it to wobble almost a quarter of an inch either way

* The lack of onboard settings means the device is unusable without Synapse installed, during which the other keys might respond to the first keymap, the second one, or their default command, more-or-less at random.

* Cherry blue switches feel *awful* for a gamepad like this. A linear switch like Cherry red switches would feel far superior. I have Cherry brown switches in my Das Keyboard which I would rather use than the blue switches. Even rubber domes don't feel as pitifully cheap as the Orbweaver's keys.

* The palm rest, making it extremely uncomfortable after even fifteen minutes. The two-position adjustment doesn't help, either. You get steep and sharp, or flat and cramp-inducing.

* The joystick's tiny range of motion makes it impossible to feel the difference between neighboring directions. I had to disable the diagonals completely to avoid accidentally pressing them

Again, and hardware that feels terrible and is poorly designed, I have no other choice but to return it. I truly hope Razer makes significant and fundamental changes to this product, and I will be happy to see what they come up with. An ergonomic, mechanical gamepad has a steady market in people who take PC gaming seriously, and I respect Razer's attempt at coming up with a solution, but they missed the mark in a huge way.

I have owned a lot of Razer products but I think I am done.

'We’ve heard our UK fans with regards to the unauthorized UK RazerStore promo code. The community is always first and we’d like to do right by you. Hear what our CEO &amp; Chief Gamer Min-Liang Tan has to say about this.
A few days ago
While we have the option of cancelling the orders legally, as the products are being sold well below their cost, it will likely cost us an insane amount of losses to make good on the orders which will really really hurt us as we’re still a small company - that much said, we want to do right by the community. For orders in the multiples of units for a single product, we will still give each an opportunity to purchase one item of each product ordered at the 90% off discount but not for multiple units of the same product. Our focus is on doing the right thing for our fans, the gamers and the community, not for resellers or users to profit from this. That’s not gaming
So that’s the plan. It’s going to take a few weeks (and up to a few months in certain cases) to get all these orders processed and shipped—a lot of stuff was already back-ordered due to high demand—and we ask that customers please bear with us. We apologize to anyone miffed or confused by this week’s happenings in the U.K.

I was searching on how to do this because it was annoying having to tab to the Itunes player to go to the next song.  All the sources I found involved 3rd party software or something other that was unnecessary. 

To do this simply go to the Macro creator in Razer Synapse, and enter the function key + the F key that corresponds with whatever you want the macro to be(Next or Previous).

Now normally after hitting the key a down key stroke would register after lifting your fingers, press the record button again to stop recording and click the little pencil mark above the recording area. Click the down key's letter to edit that key and press the Function key + the F key with which you pressed the first time creating a down stroke for that key allowing the macro to work.

I have Next/Previous macro'd to F1 and F2 and Pause on Macro Key 3. Hope this helps someone looking for a similar way to do this and I was thorough enough in the instructions.

What are your thoughts? Those with the first generation version: are you upset about this? Any thoughts?

Those that have the Nvidia 660 GTX on a similar system: How is the performance of this GPU compared to other mobile graphics cards?

1364506436.0,1b7agq,Finally found a way to bind multimedia keys to the macro keys w/o synapse 2.0,teh_al3x,4,0,2,"The only thing I never really liked was that the Blackwidow didn't have dedicated multimedia keys

But I discovered that you could import and export profiles
But after several minutes of testing around
   

First

If you save a profile

    [HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\RAZER\0.01\{EAF2D065-37FC-4469-A5FE-0E40E6F378D7}\Profiles\{8667EC92-E941-40A5-B183-036E12686971}\KEYS]

You may already have some macro keys assigned here

    ""0000003a""=hex:01,00,3a,00,00,00,01,00,00,00
      00,00,00,00,00,00,00,00

Those define the macro keys using this macro (01) as virtual keycodes, page up/down, etc. At least that's what I think is happening...  
Next come the actual macro key definitions:

    ""00000064""=hex:01,00,64,00,00,00,05,00,00,00
      00,00,00,00,00,00,00,00
    ""00000065""=hex:01,00,65,00,00,00,05,00,00,00
      00,00,00,00,00,00,00,00
    ""00000066""=hex:01,00,66,00,00,00,05,00,00,00
      00,00,00,00,00,00,00,00
    ""00000067""=hex:01,00,67,00,00,00,05,00,00,00
      00,00,00,00,00,00,00,00
    ""00000068""=hex:01,00,68,00,00,00,05,00,00,00
      00,00,00,00,00,00,00,00

If we take a closer look at the first line

    ""00000064""=hex:01,00,64,00,00,00,05,00,00,00
            ^1                  ^1                     ^^2             ^3

1. Defines which macro key is defined here. m1=64, m4=67, m5=68
2. The actual code for the key that should be bound to the macro key
3. The 01 telling it

So for using special keys on the macro keys
After long searching
Play/Pause: a2  
Next Track: 99  
Previous Track: 90  
Stop: a4  
Volume Up: b0  
Volume Down: ae  
Volume Mute: a0  
   
How to actually put that to use:  

1. Export a profile with at least one macro assigned  
2. Open it in Notepad or similar  
3. Add these lines to the beginning of the last section if it isn't already there:  
`""0000003a""=hex:01,00,3a,00,00,00,01,00,00,00
` 00,00,00,00,00,00,00,00`
3. Add these lines after that (replace the lines if you already assigned something to the macro key): 
`""000000YY""=hex:01,00,YY,00,00,00,05,00,00,00
` 00,00,00,00,00,00,00,00`

5. Save and import  
6. Voilá!

The Razer is claimed as the ""First True Gaming Tablet""

With its dedicated Graphics card and ability to run Windows 8 Pro this has the ability to download and run any game accessible to a current windows PC

The Razer Edge comes in two forms

And now that we have seen that lets look at why Razer calls this the First True Gaming Tablet

The Razer Edge has attachments customized specifically for the Razer Edge It has Three Seperate Attachments

Home Console-

This is used to attach your Razer Edge to your T.V and play through that it sports enough usb's to connect up to 4 people and play together through the T.V screen like a normal console

Controller Mode

This mode add a more handheld feel to the razer edge by adding two Controllers(one on each side) and lets you control games through the controller this will be beneficial to play FPS/RPG's/any indie game with a controller port.

Keyboard mode

This lets you attach a keyboard to the Edge and lets you make a mini-laptop with your device and use it on the go if needed to type reports or type notes anything you could need! However if your a big MMO this will be the style that you will use as you can attach a mouse to the device and have full control like you would with your desktop.


****These are sold apart from the actual device and will have to pay a price for each individual attachment*****

My Review

I think The Razer Edge is a great tool that can be used for anything that you would need a tablet for and have it be on the go. The specs Are pretty impressive considering what the device is. I feel like the attachments are what really make this product have full potential in the ""Worlds First True Gaming Tablet"" I really love the design that Razer went with the product it adds a range for what everyone could use and makes it so any gamer could use this device(wish it had 4g/3g connection and a better battery life (2h when running a game)

So Reddit What do you think?

I called a while back (in late December) about my Razer Chimera
5.1 headset

The support person I got at the time suggested I try different batteries

This time I did go out and buy new batteries and a separate charger. I bought Energizer 900mah Ni-Mh rechargeable batteries and a charger. I tried the Energizer batteries with the charging stand and it did the same thing [I forgot to mention that the same thing happened with the new pack-in batteries]. It charged for an hour, either in their advertising of the product or in the product itself]

I'm wondering what we can do about this. You say they should have an 8 hour life span and that the stand/charger should charge the batteries in 3 hours to accommodate that. Instead I have to wait 7 hours [on a separately purchased charger] to get (on average) 3 to 3.5 hours out of them. That is not satisfactory. Now I'm completely happy with my Razer Mamba and Blackwidow Ultimate

Thanks for your time

1353396276.0,13hzli,Bought a new Razer Naga Epic. Now I'm concerned.,Blazstyn,4,0,17,"
Tl;dr

**I picked up a Naga Epic last week and have enjoyed testing its functions. I became aware that the mouse has issues with remaining responsive. I don't know why

After reading into what this mouse is capable of, I decided to try and get it from BestBuy so that I could easily return the model if there were problems with it from the get-go. BestBuy usually has 2-year coverage on sales, but there was nothing available for this product.

So I checked the return policy (14 days), and during that time I installed Synapse, which downloaded soem Naga Epic software updates, and I also installed Game Booster (the new open beta version).

There were no problems with the mouse on the laptop I tested it with (MacBook Pro

After some customization of the mouse's badass lights (MALIWAN would be proud), responsive and great to try out.

Fast forward a few days, no additional USB input device drivers), I spent a few hours playing Guild Wars, surfin' the net, and digging holes in Minecraft (don't judge) and during some PvE on GW2 my mouse began to act up:

* The first disconnection was short

* The second time

* Third time, it would not respond, and no buttons would work. Battery: 91%

During all of this the Razer Synapse 2 software was running, and the device was still emitting the faint humming sound. I eventually found what is hopefully not the fix, by plugging the mouse into the cable. Placing it into the dock, cycling device power and attempting to re-pair did not fix the issue. Restarting also works but is a time-consuming process, as Synapse slows the boot cycle by several minutes.

*This quote
&gt; it keeps disconnecting in the middle of gameplay

**I'm not sure what to do now.** I have about a week before BestBuy will not accept my product return

* Could the Synapse software be freezing the mouse?
* Are there any documented solutions to this issue?
* Have you experienced anything similar and solved it?

**Any suggestions or solutions and feedback are most welcome at this point.** Additionally, you can't be happy either...

**Thanks for reading!**

1345754444.0,yprcf,Found a fix to Windows startup lag with Razer Synapse,,4,1,0,"I have found a fix to the lag or intermittent freezing of the cursor during windows startup. The freezing usually lasts about a minute or two. Make sure to read the entire post first before starting. All the steps need to be done exactly as stated. The notes at the end are critical. Side note

The fix was found in the [description](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12jrO5P2Cxw) of a youtube video. The fix is as follows

Please try the following:

* Note: A second mouse is needed*
* Disconnect
* Uninstall Synapse 2.0
* Reboot
* Uninstall .Net Framework 4
* Reboot
* Run Microsoft Updates and apply all available updates for your operating system
* Install .Net Framework 4 -Standalone from the following links
(http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?id=17718)
* Reboot
* Right click on the Synapse 2.0 installer and choose ""Run as Administrator""
* Reconnect

**Important notes**

* Make sure you uninstall all of framework 4. Which would be Microsoft Framework 4 extended and Microsoft Framework 4 client profile. It could be different for you I'm a developer and have Visual Studio installed so my versions may be slightly different. Just make sure to uninstall everything with "".Net framework 4"" in the name.
* When installing Windows updates do not install any of the .Net framework updates. They will be installed by the standalone installer in the next step.
* When installing synapse do not plug in the mouse yet. Do a full install and restart as asked. After you reset
* Make sure your firewall and antivirus is totally disabled during this entire procedure. After everything is done enable everything and add synapse to the trusted list for your firewall. 


I have done this fix myself and after several shut downs and restarts I have yet to re-encounter any lag problems. Feel free to ask questions.

So as the title of this post says I can't make up my mind concerning the new Razer laptops. 

Before I get into this, so I was looking for a laptop that could complement that while I'm gone, and I found the Razer Blade and the Pro.

Price is not really an issue since I know I'm making an investment that will be worth 3-4 years. 

The major issue that I'm facing is the screen size and quality. 

The Pro weighs in at about 6.5 pounds (not so awesome) and sports a 17 inch screen with 1920x1080 resolution - very awesome. Will a 17 inch laptop be too large?

 To me this SHOULD be where the regular Blade comes in -- 14 inches 4.5 pounds

I've had a Macbook Pro (13 inch) since June 2008

Now, will that let me keep the 1080p resolution or will it just revert to 1650x900 ? I apologize for the noob question).

Blade Pro owners- just how portable is it? Does it feel clunky/ heavy?

Regular Blade owners- do you wish you had more screen space and higher res?

Reached out to Razer Support US only to be rebuffed that my controller was not original (Bought it on Ebay from a store who are the leading importer of Razer Products in India – Tirupati Enterprises


It seems that Clause No. 4 for Razer warranty claims states that “Razer currently has no authorized resellers on Ebay or any other online auction sites.” Well in India

Razer India has been much more gracious. They said that the Onza was out of it’s product lifecycle and has been replaced by the Sabertooth and offered me two choices : Get a credit note from the store or wait till the month’s end and go for a Razer Sabertooth and pay the difference in price (Rs. 5700 tentatively

1.  The credit note can only be used against the store I purchased it and they have no other controllers (from any other manufacturers) in stock.
2.  The difference in cost of the Razer Onza TE and the Sabertooth is more than the price of the Onza itself, why I, a casual gamer, would need to spend that much on a controller whose price nearly equals to around the price of a Playstation Portable.
I think the Sabertooth is a wonderful product and I would love to own it

* the 14"" still without compromise with it's power.
* a much wider viewing angle (if you look at the CNet First Look by Scott Stein
* more battery life at less intensive use (Internet
* the same size power adapter

**Razer Blade Pro**

I would like to see:

* an upgradeable RAM
* the Pro version to be much more powerful than the 14"" *[EDITED]*
* second hard drive space (if possible for the form factor)


**Another Razer Blade in the lineup**

Now this Razer Blade is what I had in mind with all the new systems Razer has put on the market.
This Blade would rather be a 'traditional' gaming laptop and is a lower-end config than the Blade Pro. This would make the Blade Pro a much more premium item than this Blade.
I'm pretty sure everyone would love a budget-friendly system from Razer.

I would like to see:

* a choice of Haswell i5/Ivy Bridge i5 or i7
* upgradeable RAM
* removable backplate
* removable battery
* a 15 - 17 inch screen.
* a stockier form factor (possibly even heavier). I could go with 8 - 10 pounds and no more than 1.5 inches thick.
* a slot-load Optical Drive (sure nobody needs OD's in the US nowadays but to countries like us
* a choice on whether I want the Switchblade UI or the traditional laptop keyboard layout.
* HDMI and/or VGA


**I also wan't to see the Blade Pro to be much more powerful than the Blade. People from other forums

Thank you for contacting Razer Support.My name is Gary and I will be assisting you with your case regarding your Razer Sabertooth.  
  
- As for now the Razer sabertooth can not be configured with the synapse program
- You may manually program the controller. Click on the link below to get more info in mapping your keys on your controller: 
http://dl.razerzone.com/master-guides/Sabertooth/SabertoothOMG-ENG.pdf  
  
If you have any further enquiries
  
Best Regards
Razer Support Team  

  
**And my reply was...**  
  
Dear Gary
  
Yes I am aware that it cannot be configured using synapse. I was merely suggesting that you work to offer synapse support. What would be really incredible, Mass Effect, older games, etc.) Most people who want to use a gamepad for these games are going to pay for a normal controller then third party software. If you advertised that the sabertooth, not only is of superior design and functionality, but lets you use that functionality in new places that a regular controller can't. All I can get out of my sabertooth right now is the same old controller with a more convenient button arrangement. You gave me a controller with 6 extra buttons, I want to be able to use those 6 extra buttons instead of having a controller that has multiple buttons that do the same thing.  
  
Thanks for reading.

1374703402.0,1izidi,"Questions about Razer's warranties, quality, and customer support",Rambro332,4,9, this is my first Razer product

-First off; how's the longevity for Razer products? I'm going to probably use this laptop for a few years; and I expect something so expensive to endure for a while. The question is; does it? Will this sleek machine wear down within a year of purchase?

-What happens if the Laptop Breaks in some way or gets stolen? Who do I contact? I've heard some pretty bad things about Razer's customer support; too many bad things in my opinion for a company who's items are so incredibly expensive. What exactly do the warranties cover? Is customer support helpful? How long does it usually take to repair or replace a faulty or broken Razer product?

-Finally

But this program does seem like it could be used, along with controls for game volume, chat volume, and mute. It also comes with a USB cable to plug the adaptor into a computer. You use Surround on your computer to set up your personal headphones, and these settings are then synced to the adaptor.

I already know the controller was designed to run game audio through that port, obviously since I came up with it on the toilet.

1372459979.0,1ha1un,Lets Discuss: Mice/mouse pad,Zhaopow,4,2,5,"ok girls and boys

Out of all the peripherals at your computer i think the one that people are the most picky about are their mice. i just so happens that mice also come in all different configurations.

the first thing i'd like to discus is the different types of grips. the three types are fingertip grip
[http://bluetoothmousedeals.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Bluetooth-mouse-deals-palmclaw-and-fingertip-grip.png]

* Palm grip is the most common grip and is easier to control then the other grips. Since the user’s hand almost entirely rests on the mouse

* Claw grip is used for people who want a bit more speed than the palm grip and a nice medium between the palm and fingertip grip.

* In the fingertip grip the user is only holding the mice by their fingers. this gives you more precision and agility compared to the other grips. Unlike the other grips this grip cannot be used on all mice. Fingertip grip requires a low profile mice. This type of grip is the most fatiguing grip. 

Now another thing i would like to talk about that isn't mentioned as much as the grip styles is the mousepad

For me

I bought a Razer Kraken, both sides of the headset work when I plug it into my phone to listen to music.
This is the problem, or play very low, the other side will play fine. I have determined that it has to be a problem with the laptop. I have all the sound drivers updated and all the system updates done. The only way that I have found to get the headset to work perfectly while plugged into my laptop is to unplug and re-plug the headset over and over and over and over and over and over and over until it magically works on both sides. I contacted Razer support and they said it wasn't their problem and to contact Lenovo. I have been on the Lenovo forums and it seems there is no answer to my predicament.
It's just very annoying that I spend a little over 70 dollars on a headset and it doesn't work well on my laptop
So, and I have no idea what to do. I don't want to be ~70 dollars in the drain, but this problem is very stressful and not worth the pain of having to come home to a equipment problem every single damn day.

my computer runs a line out of the front to a stereo and the blackwidow uses the audio connection in the back which allows my headphones to be plugged in through the keyboard.

ive verified rear audio jack works by plugging my speakers in and my head phones directly into the computer and other audio sources.

through the process of elimination i am able to determine the problem lies within the keyboard... somewhere. ive reset all synapse settings, tried suggestions from google searches.

Im at a loss as to what happened.

1362980819.0,1a2gdx,The Razer Edge Pro is making me upset...,TheManUpstairsZ,8,4,20,"A little explanation I have been in the market to replace my 7 year old desktop which back in 2005 cost me $3000 thus its lasted me many great years and still plays even the most intensive games today just fine...the problem is its bulky and now tablets can keep up with and even out produce my desktop...so I'm looking to dump the old box and get something more portable for gaming.

My first thought was a gaming laptop...for $3-4K I can get a 680m 512ssd i7 32gb ram my fear there really is heat...that's a lot of power to be confined in a chassis with limited cooling...kind of my same fear with the edge pro.

Then there's the windows 8 tablet market...right now the Surface Pro

Both the surface and samsung are 1080p...however both lack any means to plug in ethernet even none on the keyboard dock which is frustrating because that would solve my problems.

The Razer Edge Pro is the most frustrating one...it claims to be The Gaming Tablet but is riddled with problems...720p...on a dedicated graphics card is a joke...why even bother putting a tablet together if your going to skimp out on it esp when your going to charge a premium...the second part is the battery is laughable...even in non gaming mode 4 hours...sigh.

Then there's the fact for PC gamers that the keyboard dock isn't even launching for 6 months after the tablet releases...let alone any identification on if the tablet or keyboard dock will include an ethernet port..

Id love to find a Gaming tablet but it doesn't seem a true one exists...and I'm not going to be the sucker who forks out $1500 then 6 months later when they release the dock they bundle it with a 1080p Pro+ model and everyone who bought the original gets screwed.

I also want to see a true stress test on the Razer Edge Pro...give Avoidlol from from twitch tv one and let him do a 24 hour Diablo 3 farm session on it...I want to see under that kind of stress how the tablet holds up...if you don't understand what I mean just go to twitch.tv and search for avoidlol....he plays a wizard who casts non~stop spells that would lag even powerful machines today and he does it for hours on end...it'd truly test the device.

My point is I want a gaming tablet that can be gamed on all day long without issues...I want it to be 1080p with an ethernet jack...because playing anything serious over wifi is a joke.

what i tried:

* unplug mouse
* uninstall driver using CCleaner
* download and install the driver from the razer page
* re plug the mouse
* restart computer
didn't work

then

* unplug mouse

* remove registry key (HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE -&gt; SOFTWARE -&gt; Razer) note: i'm not very good at stuff like this so i probably deleted the wrong entry/might have overlooked something anyways

Arrows seem to be pointing towards .Net Framework 4. There is either something wrong with their implementation or there is a bug in .Net itself.

After scouring the internet I found a forum post with a supposed fix. Uninstall .Net Framework

Now for a new solution...

This attempt involves [rebuilding .net's native images](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2947118/wpf-slow-to-start-on-x64-in-net-framework-4-0).

Open up the command prompt as admin and enter the following (the path will differ if you are on 32-bit):

    cd C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework64\v4.0.30319
    ngen update

You may get a few exceptions as the image builds. This is normal. The process takes ~1 minute. **Note that you may have to do this every time .Net updates.**

1374868894.0,1j49cb,Extremely disappointed with the DA 2013,lukeman3000,6,5,11,"I've had an old Microsoft mouse for about the past 8 years or so. It's an ambidextrous mouse

In that time, as well.

Yesterday, I drove home and could hardly wait to get it out of the package and kick off the first night of my summer break with some awesome gaming.

My excitement was quickly ended when I made the first of two disappointing discoveries. Upon plugging the mouse in and downloading/running Synapse, any mouse settings whatsoever.

Without getting into why I think that's completely asinine, and downright wrong, I'll just say that I was extremely put off by this choice that Razer has made.

However

I'm in the physical therapy field

There is a natural phenomenon called tenodesis grasp which is something that is very important to some people with spinal cord injuries who no longer have control over their fingers (but who can still control their wrist). However, palm down. Try to completely relax your hand/fingers and then slowly bend your wrist so that the palm of your hand becomes perpendicular with the ground. Notice how your fingers close a bit? That's tenodesis grasp.

When using a mouse, combined with the weight of my finger, is more than enough to overcome the small amount of resistance that the right mouse button offers. Also, I think that part of the problem may stem from the fact that the top of the mouse is one piece of thin plastic, so weight applied closer to the palm of the hand is transferred to the mouse buttons, as well.

Anyways, I expect that the mouse will function very well, and look/feel nice, too. It seems Razer has their priorities backwards. The mouse looks and feels nice, but it doesn't function well.

Also

To that end, I just don't know anything about the switches themselves (which ones to buy, where to buy from ,etc.). I need to do some research. But if worse comes to worse, that may be what I end up doing. I can look past the issues with Synapse if I can have a mouse which feels and functions well. Like they say, if you want something done right, do it yourself.",False,,http://www.reddit.com/r/razer/comments/1j49cb/extremely_disappointed_with_the_da_2013/
