hey bushcrafters, but i'm trying to be as accurate as possible in terms of material when it comes down to what the natives would have used in my area. the fletching are turkey tail and wing, along with one or 2 red tailed hawk feathers. pounded deer sinew and pine/charcoal pitch for securing the head. i still need to wrap the feathers and knock, i cheated a little bit and used super glue to tack them in place. in making these i've already learned alot, mainly that i will be more consitant in material when making the next set. i went out last week and cut 25 red osier dogwood shafts and 25 wild rose shafts. i realized i did not cut second year growth on a lot of the wild rose so most of those are out the window. i also picked up a dead turkey vulture on the road and got some really sweet feathers. i am also going to scrape the next batch to the same diameter. thanks for looking!",,False,t5_2qnfs,True

EDIT: Glad to see people are interested

1) Practicing a little, sporadically. For example, I keep the kit on my desk at work (I use nice-smelling woods, so it doesn't bother people). I will take 10-20 minute-long breaks throughout the day, make a little bit of smoke each time, then go back to what I am doing.

2) My hands! Practicing for more than a few minutes will form blisters very quickly. This is another reason for frequent spurts of activity, I would damage my hands. Each day I try to bring my hands just up to that edge, then I back off and let them heal overnight. Figuring out this balance made a world of difference in my progress.

3) Process over product. If I ""try to get a coal"", it doesn't work if you want it too badly.

4) An expert hand-driller

5) Being able to bust a coal does not mean I am able to start a fire. I am discovering that the tinder bundle is a skill in itself

6) People are very impressed by seeing someone make smoke, one girl exclaimed ""THAT'S MAGIC!""

7) The more I learn about anything, music, and believe it or not, relationships.

8) The amounts of speed and pressure that I need vary thoughout the process. When I am making dust to fill the notch

EDIT II:

9) Learning to enjoy the process was critical. At first

UPDATE: Just busted my first coal with a cattail reed. Haven't identified the wood,,False,self,t5_2qnfs,True,,True

An FYI for those interested. This bottle is a stainless copy of a widemouth Nalgene 32-oz bottle that found it's way into the kit of many bushcrafters.  Manufactured by Guyot Designs and now distributed by and marked Nalgene.     The absence of this bottle has been noticed, but never quite reached the popularity of the standard due to size and tapered bottom.  Good bottle, meh pot, and nesting/wobbly issues. I sent an email to Nalgene about 1.5 yrs ago asking about availability, and they claimed Guyot had failed to have them produced due to their own problems.  I would receive and email when (and if available again).  Didn't get the email, but checked and they are back in stock.      

They have been hard to find for a while, and It is part of my BOB gear in a cook kit.  Single wall SST and was originally touted as being appropriate for cooking in. I ordered a new one, and will report if the quality is less/more than it was, or if it has changed.  My old one is the same dimensions as the plastic Nalgene wide mouth 32-0z.  Human Gear Cap Cap fits dandy, and nests great inside GSI 18-oz camp cup.  Both of which fit inside a 5.11 or Condor water bottle holder.  I prefer the Condor, it is insulated well, has a pocket, just some food for thought for those looking into water bottle / canteen cook/carry kit.  I can add pics of this stuff later,self,

From /u/summiter

2. **What kind of sleeping system should i get? A tent and sleeping bag? Hammock? make my own from tree's?**

3. **What tools are absolutely critical? So far I've gotten knife, however what about things like flint and steel, kindling, fishing line, other things like that?**

4. **How many clothes do you bring? two sets and just wash them

From /u/PapaShane about Jeans and hiking/backpacking

Jeans are bad because they don't dry quickly, when in the wilderness, cotton kills. Having said that, I've backpacked in jeans plenty of times and I'm still around to tell of it. In the summer when it's hot though, it's nice to have lightweight poly blend or something along those lines, something quick-drying and breathable and light but still tough enough to withstand brush. I'm also not a fan of convertible (zip-off) pants, the zippers annoy me...I like my shorts to be shorts and my pants to be pants. In the winter months, hiking-specific pants tend to be pricey. Check out military surplus stuff, Columbia


5. **Boots

6. **Any little trinkets that youve brought that youve found essential (I'm looking for miscelaneous items you should bring that would help you whether its books or other things)**.

From /u/vlehto Just wanted to add to your trinkets list:

Water bottle (simplest you can find is probably good enough)

Cup

Spoon

Toilet paper

Dish washing brush and some hand washing-up liquid

Toothbrush and some paste

A towel

Bandages and roll of that thing you wrap around bigger wounds

Nice to have:

Nail scissors

Safety pins

Plastic bags

Cotton bags for your clothes(this way you don't need a backpack with million pockets)

Good book

Little duct tape

Fishing line and few hooks

Climate: Semi-Arid
Average Temperature: 35 C
Property: Camp has a large forest on property which consists mostly of grasses

A lot of Dave Canterbury's video's (and other people's too) on you tube mention Bank Line as an alternative to Paracord. 

I'd like to buy some to test it out for myself but I'm struggling to find a supplier (I'm in the UK).

I'm guessing it's primary use is to do with fishing but a couple of trawls (no pun intended) through a few fishing tackle suppliers hasn't turned anything up.

Basically, water bottles, etc.) from various family members serving in the armed forces. I really enjoyed the physical aspects of the craft, particularly shelter making and fire lighting, and used to practice both in this nearby abandoned quarry (long since overgrown) pretty regularly (don't worry, I never created any infernos; I just really enjoyed the satisfaction of turning a tiny spark into a decent flame). Anyway, I also enjoyed the planning aspect, or convenient cooking system

Basically, and containing a small (yet effective) flint and steel i trimmed to fit within the tin itself.

Anyway

Main product details are:

- Waterproof tin (rubber sealant)

- Compact (diameter of around 8cm (maybe less))

- Reliable (Nothing like charcloth for catching sparks)

- Cheap (around 5 GBP

Note: I've already looked quite extensively into production costs (packaging

1365707239.0,1c5iy6,Sog Jungle Primitive Review,wturiel,6,7,1,"The SOG Jungle Safari has been a decent knife for a large blade.  The length of the blade is 9.5 inches and is .15 inches thick.  It feels much lighter than it looks.  This blade has been useful but is a bit overpriced for what it does.  A good solid machete will do most of the tasks that this knife is good for.

Lets look at what this blade is good at, clearing brush, chopping small trees and saplings and cutting high grass in areas around your camp.  Last year at a bushcraft meetup I needed to clear out an area of hight grass to keep out the snakes and such and in a couple of minutes i was able to cut the grass in a very large area.  The blade is light and swings well and you forget its on your belt very quickly.  The pouch on the sheath is large enough to hold a full size multitool and when i am in the bush my Leatherman Wave usually rides in there.  The sheath is tough and works well, it has a snap that holds the blade in place and the belt loop is very large, you can fit a USGI pistol belt in it with room to spare.  The handle is very grippy and work well even when wet.

The steel is fairly soft and after a year of medium use it has a small warp in the edge of the blade

The knife has done its job but for 40 dollars I would recommend getting a good machete or one of the versions of the knife that does not have the saw on the back of the blade as it destroys a baton fairly quickly and the saw is not very good.  You can pick up a good folding saw,,False,self,t5_2qnfs,False,,True

You have to shred the dryer lint pretty well to get this to work.  Also, you're going to get hair in your dryer lint.  So, either be picky about your lint, or use cotton balls.
