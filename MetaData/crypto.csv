Because of this

Now I already know that there are numerous 'Introduction to Cryptography' tutorials available on the net.  These appear in various forms including audio, making this a much more 'interactive' tutorial than the existing static 'one-way' methods.  I will refer to other materials where appropriate and I think they are of good quality.

I aim to require as little prerequisite knowledge as possible

* Symmetric block ciphers.
* Block cipher modes of operation.
* Methods of cryptanalysis (including linear and differential cryptanalysis).
* Hash functions.
* Message Authentication Codes (MACs).
* Asymmetric encryption schemes.
* Implementing cryptography.
* Breaking cryptographic implementations.

I *do not* aim to cover what cryptography is nor cryptography in a historical context.  This is a topic that has been covered many times and the Wikipedia pages for these are pretty good (links: [Cryptography](https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Cryptography) and [History of Cryptography](https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/History_of_cryptography))

However, but each person may pick and choose which areas they would like to research more thoroughly.

For those that are wondering about myself and my motivations for doing this: cryptography is a major hobby of mine and I have spent a number of years working on the topic.  I feel that cryptography is one of the few areas where multiple interesting topics (such as computer security

Thus, too detailed, requires too much prerequisite knowledge etc.  I will also attempt to answer questions where I can.

Please note that I am doing this in my limited spare time and so I cannot guarantee timely updates or even guarantee that the series will run for any significant period of time.  All I can commit to is that I will give it my best shot with the time I have available.

## Administrata

As this is the the first post in the series I have had to take a guess on what level to write for.  Because of this

Also, we might get into some interesting topics of discussion.

Additionally

## What is a Symmetric Block Cipher

A symmetric block cipher is best explained by breaking down and explaining the individual words (working backwards

* Cipher - A method of enciphering (encrypting) data.
* Block - The method works with data in blocks ('chunks') of a specific size.
* Symmetric - The method is symmetrical in that it uses the same key for both encryption and decryption.

Thus

Symmetric block ciphers are one of most commonly used cryptographic primitives.  They are used to encrypt both data in storage (file encryption, this is something that we will not cover at this time.

The easiest way to think of a block cipher is as a black-box:

                     Key
                       |
                       |
                      \/
    Plaintext --&gt; BLOCK-CIPHER --&gt; Ciphertext

Where:

* Plaintext (p) is the unencrypted message we wish to encrypt.
* Ciphertext (c) is the encrypted message returned from the cipher.
* The Key (K) is the set of parameters that tells the block cipher how to encrypt the data.

Using the abbreviations above this can also be written c=E(K,c).

The mapping of the inputs to outputs is controlled by the secret key.  We will not use the term secret key in further posts to refer to the encryption key for symmetric ciphers (preferring instead

Mathematically

When looking at block ciphers in this abstract way it becomes clear that while a block cipher is just a 'simple mapping' between its inputs and outputs

## Block Cipher Parameters

Each block cipher has a number of parameters which can affect its security.  The two main parameters are:

* Block length - This is the size of the message upon which the block cipher will operate.  It is usually specified in bits.
* Key size - This is the length of the encryption key.  Again

The block lengths for current modern ciphers are usually 128 bits of data.  For messages that are longer than a single block (the majority of cases) a cipher *mode of operation* is required.  Modes of operation will be something that we will return to at a later date.

The key size for modern ciphers is usually 128 or 256 bits in length.  As many other cryptographers have mentioned beforehand: a larger key does not necessarily mean that a cipher is secure

## DES and Feistel Ciphers

The first modern real block cipher was the [Data Encryption Standard

DES is a type of *Feistel cipher*.  A Feistel cipher is where a relatively simple function is applied to the data multiple times (it is a type of *iterated block cipher*).  Many modern ciphers are iterated block ciphers.

In the case of DES, a *round function* is applied to the right half using a *subkey*.  This is then XORed with the left half and the two halves exchanged.  This is performed 16 times (16 rounds, each with a different subkey).

Note that the two halves are *not* exchanged after the final round.  This makes the whole construction the same for both encryption and decryption and therefore makes implementation easier.  As we will return to later

Due to the short 56 bit key the security of DES is not really suitable for use today.  Thus the recommendation is not to use DES for any new implementations and only use it where backwards compatibility is required.

---

NIST has selected five SHA-3 candidate algorithms to advance to the third (and final) round:

·         BLAKE

·         Grøstl

·         JH

·         Keccak

·         Skein

 

The selection was challenging, but none of these candidates was clearly broken.  However, it is meaningless to discuss the security of a hash function without relating security to performance, so in reality, NIST wanted highly secure algorithms that also performed well. We preferred to be conservative about security, and in some cases did not select algorithms with exceptional performance, largely because something about them made us “nervous

 

Performance is multidimensional: no algorithm excelled in every dimension.  Every second-round candidate achieved at least tolerable performance on mainstream desktop or server systems, some exploited parallelism with vector units, and some seemed to fully exploit the considerable parallelism that can be achieved by conventional superscalar arithmetic logic units (ALUs) that can simultaneously launch several instructions per clock cycle.  Several algorithms also exploited the power of 64-bit-wide ALUs.

 

No algorithm survived to become a finalist that did not have a clear round structure that could be readily adjusted to trade security for performance.  NIST eliminated several algorithms because of the extent of their second-round tweaks or because of a relative lack of reported cryptanalysis – either tended to create the suspicion that the design might not yet be fully tested and mature. NIST was generally comfortable with tweaks to the number of rounds or to constants

 

Some teams announced the tweaks that they would make if they were selected for the final round.  NIST evaluated the second-round submissions

 

NIST also considered diversity in the selection of the finalists. The selected five finalists incorporated a number of new design ideas that have arisen in the last few years, and on the interaction between addition and XOR operations.

 

NIST thanks the submitters of all fourteen second-round candidates. Every second-round candidate was a very professional effort

 

NIST will publish a report on the selection of the SHA-3 finalists in the near future that explains the rationale for the selections on an algorithm-by-algorithm basis.

 

If tweaks are being considered for the final round

I am a CS student, I'm concerned about the requirements of grad school for a career in this field, or my ability to start a career with only a bachelor's degree. My GPA is a 3.5, with some development work experience, but no formal research yet. I'm unsure about how far fetched grad school is considering this.

The underlying encryption relies on either encrypting all messages with every group member's public key or negotiating (N^2 -N) / 2 symmetric keys for every pair of people in the group (or some other similar construction). Having a single room private key doesn't cut it because it would be too easy for that information to fall into the wrong hands and if a leak was discovered there would be no way to correct the problem without relying on an outside channel.

Both attacks (BREACH is just a CRIME variant) exploit the fact that compression can leak information about a message by way of the size of the compressed output.

Abstracting further

*Any transform applied to plaintext prior to encryption that modifies the size of the plaintext in response to its content could potentially leak information about the plaintext.*

Thoughts?

Edit: I ask because I'm considering yanking compression from [this](https://github.com/zerotier/ZeroTierOne). Seems to me that in a virtual IP network it'd be very easy to execute a variant of CRIME using ICMP PINGs or similar. Yikes. Seems like this would impact OpenVPN, Tor, all kinds of stuff. Seems particularly dangerous for meshnets, Tor, and similar, since executing an oracle attack is easy in such environments.",,,,

1373868237.0,1ibo88,newb here designing an encrypted chat server/client,d4rch0n,27,6,16,"That title is probably a glaring red flag

The basic idea behind my chat service is that the server will run on a Tor hidden service, and each message a user sends includes a new public key to reply to, and some sort of integrity check which I haven't implemented, with hopes that will prevent someone from modifying the message. I know the devil's in the details and that that is a vague description, but that's the general plan. I'm curious if there are any obvious flaws with this idea, at that high level.

So far

On connect

The client responds with its own public key

There are currently 3 types of requests the client can make: get a list of messages to it, or the method of attaching a new public key to a message to be used for further communication.

One mistake I already know I made is that I encrypt long messages in chunks using that block cipher. What's the right way to do this?

I should probably use a much higher-level crypto library

Do you see any flaws in the general design? Any suggestions? I plan to write the client in C++ after I finish the prototype in Python. The client is really just a simple test of the protocol at the moment

The source can be found here if you want to see some terrible code: https://bitbucket.org/johannestaas/conclave

Has anybody proposed giving a PGP-WoT style system the ability to perform ""password resets"" (actually ""private key resets"")?  The idea is that while you still control your private key you are encouraged to sign certificates indicating who your friends are, **but also** allow changing keys by having every member of a friend-group signed by the old key sign a new key.

The job of serializing these ""key resets"" can be handled the same way Namecoin handles the transfer of key-value pairs.  In fact

Has anything like this this been proposed before?

But let's say that you use the password to open up the volume, the same volume size, and the same Initialization Vector (Those aren't encrypted in any way, right? I think this is where my plan goes wrong.), use those to encrypt the same plaintext that you got out of the truecrypt volume.

If your new volume, there is no hidden volume. If they are different, there is a hidden volume.

I realize that this won't work. People much smarter than me have tried to break plausible deniability crypto.

Would this be a workable system for one-time-use PGP/GPG keys? Benefits include the ability to destroy the message decryption key when you delete the message. The result being that if the master key were compromised it would not compromise any past messages that may have been previously captured on the network.

---

How it works:

Each party has one master key-pair. It is assumed they already have each others master public keys.

All parties generate several one-time-use

The sender goes to the key-server and requests a temporary public key for the user they want to encrypt a message to (the key-server then removes that key from its list). Each outgoing message gets signed with a temporary private key (with a short expiry time) generated by the sender. The corresponding sender temporary public key is then signed by the sender's master private key and sent with the message so the signature can be verified. Then

Upon receiving the message the recipient checks that the sender's temporary public key included in the message has been signed by the sender's master private key. Then uses their temporary private key to decrypt the message. Finally they verify the signature using the sender's temporary public key. When they delete the message

---

I'm pretty sure I read about something similar to this at one point. Does it already exist? Is there a better solution? Could OTR (using a Diffie-Helman key exchange) be used in a similar way, also signing the components for verification purposes? Could this route still be used for multi-party communication (encrypting a message to many recipients)? Would Diffie-Hellman have to be replaced by an authenticated multi-party key agreement protocol (it seems there are several papers on that subject)?

I had never heard of this before so i googled and found that in fact radiation can when traveling through memory can flip the bits.

My idea is to monitor the bits on the SD card and record when the flipping took place and what bits had changed.

Firstly. Is it possible to read memory like this at the bit level using a higher level language like python? and will the bit flipping be consistent enough to create random numbers? i.e is the flipping of bits something that will happen on off occasion or quite frequently?

I'm looking at a system that is taking input (x) and returning a base64 encoded string that appears to be encrypted. The system is part of a web application I'm testing. You submit (x) in a form

I believe it is a block cipher, 5-23 gives 216 bytes (288 base64 chars), 29 gives 240 bytes (320 base64 chars) etc...

I do not believe it is ECB. Entering long strings of the same character produces no repeated blocks.

CBC doesn't seem to make sense either. It seems as if a single character change anywhere in the plaintext affects ALL of the ciphertext.

I know the timestamp is being incorporated into the plain text somehow. The system will output the same ciphertext for the same plaintext input multiple times
eg:suppose I submit these requests at 10:51:38

Anyone have any ideas? What I'm most hung up on is the fact that a single byte change in the plain text is causing ALL bytes in the ciphertext to change AND at the same time you can get the same ciphertext for the same plaintext suggesting there is no random nonce or anything like that going on.

Looking around online, and trying all sorts of ways to get a sensical value out of an online DER decoder (http://lapo.it/asn1js/) turned up nothing (I guess it couldn't properly parse it, which makes me think it's not in that format).

Does anyone know the details of how this is done?

One of the issues is that this means salts across duplicate passwords are duplicate

I have been thinking about this for a while

Currently we have Yubikey, and that is what I want. Edit: This just in through /r/privacy - http://www.goldkey.com/ - but not open source, and probably don't do all these things I'm asking for!

So this is basically a high level description of what I want:

First of all it has to be TEMPEST resistant (such as power analysis resistant) and tamper proof (impossible to extract keys by taking it apart).

The basic **hardware capabilities**: NFC, wireless charging, built in screen and keyboard (no smartcard please where you enter the PIN on *another* device you might not own and have to trust *that* device's screen). Also enough CPU, RAM and storage to handle the features I'm going to suggest (I think it should have about 4 GB storage (maybe far more?) - might be overkill, but you never know what you're gonna have to store, like years of Bitcoin keys, or just using it as an encrypted USB drive in general).There is another cool tech that I don't remember the name of that uses your body's electrical field to transfer signals to devices you touch directly

Features: First one I'm going to mention is **secure key syncing (backup)**. This will be a small device, if new keys have been added on either. Lose the one you had on you, go get the one at home and get a new one to sync with. You don't want to lose all your keys! I am thinking about using Bluetooth 4.0 for this (low power usage) and transfer everything encrypted (on top of the BT protocol's encryption).

It could replace all your current **RFID/NFC tags** for doors and such. Depending on the security level needed

It would allow **secure logins** and everything, on web sites, games, etc... You'll never get your password snatched by spyware/keyloggers again, and no more account hijacking! It would work as two factor authentication (you need the device and the PIN/password for that site's key on it).

It would be able to **authenticate transactions, this would be a drastical improvement - when you make transactions, the device would simultaneously display the sender (precise account), recipient (precise account), the exact sum to transfer and currency, and any other details you might want (receipt?). You'd sign all these details together. This would make phishing and social engineering much harder, because even the current system with dongles ""gets busted"" by social engineering from time to time. (Would help against ""I lost my dongle, transfer $1000 to us to get it"".)

It would keep track of your friends' public keys and more (**keychain**). Logging in to your home computer through SSH? This device can authenticate the other end of the connection and display it on it's screen (""you're now connected to 'My home PC' *(stored personal public key)* [public key hash] over SSH""). Same goes for connecting to your work VPN from a friend. While malware might be able to interfere with the connection if there are any on the computer you're connecting with

It would also have an **RNG** for various purposes. It would make it easy to generate new keys *on the device*

It could be used as a **keystore**, and be able to easily handle encryption/decryption.

It could be used to handle encryption/decryption externally. This would primarily be useful when you use it to decrypt data where the key is reused for other data and you don't trust the computer for more than holding *that* decrypted data at the moment

It could work as a personal TPM for all your devices

1344925417.0,y6vg4,New cipher: Blowfish with 128-bit block size (NOVA2),nsa_at_home,16,5,10,"Hi all

Recently I have been working on a project to expand [Blowfish](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blowfish_%28cipher%29) to a 128-bit block size. My variaton is called NOVA2


NOVA2 is a variant of Blowfish which doubles the block size to 128 bits. It has the same structure as Blowfish with a few changes to accomodate the larger block. All addition is done mod 2^64. It is designed to be fast on 64-bit processors.

The S-boxes are 8 x 64 S-boxes (8-bit input

Originally I was going to go with four 16 x 64 S-boxes

The P-array is now eighteen 64-bit words (for 16 rounds) instead of 32-bit words in Blowfish because of the larger block size. As a result



The F function has been extended to compute 64-bit values. Four S-box lookups

The initial vaues of the S-boxes and P-array is the hexadeciaml digits of the fractional part of the square root of 2. I did this to avoid any symmetry with Blowfish during the subkey generation


Sample code (Written in C) is available [here](http://nsaathome.org/content/crypto/nova2/n2-sample-1.0.zip)


Aswell as a [draft specification](http://nsaathome.org/content/crypto/nova2/n2-draft.pdf) (No test vectors yet

**An encryption method where the plain text and cipher text are always the same size is an example
of which of the following types of encryption?**

**A. RC4**

**B. MD5**

**C. Steam Cipher**

**D. Block Cipher**

When I first read the question and didn't look at the answers I immediately thought to myself that most stream ciphers work this way. I then saw option A and option C and got confused as I thought they would both be valid answers (only one option is allowed for this question). I then noticed the misspelling for option C and then thought A would be correct so I went with that. I then found out that the ""correct"" answer is D (block cipher). This doesn't seem right as I thought the only time a block cipher produces cipher text whose length is equal to the length of the plain text is when the plain text's length is a multiple of the block size.

What I'm looking for is any proof or detailed analysis that will convince me what is the real level of security attained by this design (assuming the individual ciphers are robust and the keys and random pads used for each layer are unique and truly random).

It is my understanding that in this case

   size_in_blocks(plaintext) * number of layers

We want to build a file-sharing, you surely won't succeed. But be sure that we have already a good pile of free-software code, it's not just a fantasy.

So

* Every node is the same as the next one
* Each node has a random ID (a key in the DHT) that identify him in the network
* The DHT provide a routing algorithm

For the file sharing part:

* Each file is divided in chunk
* Each chunk is encrypted a private crypto key of the original owner.
* Each node can transmit the needed key to decrypt chunks if the user has decided to allow that.
* Each user has a unique ID
* Each user can share files with different scope (private
* Private sharing mean only node with the same user ID can decrypt the file (private data replication ...)
* Targeted sharing mean that the owner allow a set of specific user ID to access the file (holiday picture sharing
* Public sharing mean that everyone can access the file (free content publication
* At anytime

So

* How to identify a user ?
* How to encrypt/sign chunk ? A set of asymmetric key for each file/share ?
* How to exchange key between node without leaking ?

This is my first time reading a crypto paper. I am more into other types of security (web mostly) so I was not familiar with all the terminology etc. Sorry if some of the questions come off as retarded

Here are the questions I asked the author:

1. This attack makes it possible to figure out the plaintext version of CBC mode encrypted text. Does this not mean all CBC mode ciphertext (at least the ciphertexts using the same padding) can be decrypted? Why bother using CBC mode at all if an attack like this exists?

2. C^-1(y) is the decryption function

3. Why does knowing the padding help at all? I don't understand how knowing whether or not we have a valid padding can affect whether or not we can retrieve plaintext.

4. Because we are looking at the blocks which have padding

5. In section 3.1 (Last Word Oracle) you mention that the most likely valid padding is the one which ends with 1. What makes this so?

6. In section 3 you define a function

7. In 3.2

The software uses Scrypt to generate a hash, each time a choice between n alternatives has to be taken as part of the password generation phase, the result (between 0 and n - 1) is the hash modulo n, and the remaining hash is the result of the long division by n.

The default generated passwords have length 18, and 2-5 upper case letters, the rest being lower case letters. This leads to an entropy of about 115 bits. 

The program allows also the generation of different forms of passwords: PIN code of any length, etc...

Compared to other solutions, you can re-generate the exact same passwords again, provided you still remember your master keyword and still have access to your hardware key. An other advantage would be the different password schemas available, which allow to produce the exact format a website require.

I have two main points on which I'd like to have your comments:

-User types a message setting plaintext

-User selects a file

-Program inventories the byte offset of every byte present in the file. So for example for every time 0x24 appears, along with an offset.

-MD5 Hash is taken of file

-Hash used as a seed to produce a cypher map

-The program iterates through the plaintext (which was just translated via the cypher map)

-When its all finished

Decryption is a reverse of the process.

Basically

XORing with the md5 prevents having a partial key file from working.

Question 1: Each iteration, to how the salt and password are combined at each step of the iteration? Is it enough to simply concatenate the prior hash value (last-iteration-hash) along with the salt and password?

The big conclusion from the paper
Conclusion:
XBX Results May 2012
Conclusion

BLAKE is our first choice on 6 out of 9 analyzed platforms with the Cortex-M3 counting as two analyzed
platforms as it is quite versatile and we made two choices based on low cost and high throughput scenarios. On
the remaining three platforms BLAKE takes second place twice and third place once. BLAKE still appears
to be the most suitable SHA-3 candidate for embedded platforms because it is scalable and balanced
and small.

Skein is strong on high-throughput platforms and therefore should be the first choice on fast modern
ARM Cortex designs
platforms and claims one 3rd place. Overall we consider Skein to be the second best choice for SHA-3 on
embedded platforms by a small margin. It is very fast on fast CPUs and faster than BLAKE at 512-bit on
more than half the platforms. It is also relatively small for 512-bit output.

With two first places
After the newest submissions by the Grøstl team Keccak now has to share third rank with Grøstl
achieved three first places

Keccak is the smallest candidate on our 8-bit platform and among the smallest on the other size sensitive
platforms. Grøstl managed to deliver low memory footprint on AVR and ARM-platforms as well as significant
increases of speed with the newly submitted implementations.

Table 7 list the rankings achived by the candidates according to chapter 6 together with a simple score by
awarding three points for every first place
the candidate was ranked third.

While all five finalists do work on all analyzed platforms JH can not threaten the others when it comes
to embedded platforms. Keccak and Grøstl excel at the low end

1334624829.0,sdecq,Question: Adventures in bruteforcing,nullandnull,10,2,10,"Hello

* How can I detect valid strings without using a dictionary? 
* Could I use frequency analysis? 
* What if the data set is contained within compiled code such as a malware executable file? 
* Wouldn't ASCII extracted from an executable have a different frequency than dictionary text? Example ""http://google.com""
* What other techniques can be used?
* How would you solve this problem?


Notes:
I have slimmed down the false positives by only printing data sets that have valid ASCII after being XORed. Even with that I still have a high false positive rate of 20+ for each encoded string. I'm not worried about Unicode or wide-chars just ASCII. I have been messing around with doing ngram on ascii strings dumped using the sysinternal strings tool. Odds are I'm going to need to a more powerful machine :) For examples of the data and output please see the following [post](http://hooked-on-mnemonics.blogspot.com/2012/04/adventures-in-bruteforcing.html).

###Trustd

A peer to peer framework for disseminating information based on a web of trust. Currently this is aimed at providing a DNS solution for the meshnet

#### Goals

  1. Store the location of a resource by distributing it among a network of peers so that no central point of failure exists.
  2. Utilize dynamically generated trust ratings of peers to ensure that users are directed to their most trusted instance of the resource.
  3. Secure the pointers to the resources location using cryptographically signed documents.
  4. Enable warnings and alerts to be propagated through the network in the event a server is seized or becomes malicious.

#### Key Points

  * Clients choose which servers they trust and how much they trust them. Servers choose which location for the resource they trust the most and provide that to the client. The client then chooses which server it trusts the most and accepts the location for the resource from that single server.
  * Every client MAY run a server instance and maintain their own database but it is not a requirement.
  * Every server node maintains a local copy of the location of the most trusted source for the requested resource.
    * Resources may be referenced by a pointer stored in the database
    * In the event of caching

### Network Operation

#### Resource Creation

When a client submits a request to create a new database entry

 * Server checks the local database first and if no reference is found it then sends out a request to the entire network for the resource. If no pre-existing version is found
   * If the resource already exists on the network
     * This doesn't prevent the record from being created through other means or other servers
     * The creator could go elsewhere and try again and perhaps find a node willing to create it, but the new server will have a non existent trust rating so his content will always be overridden by the preexisting version from other servers.
   * **If the server receives a notification of new resource for an existing record
     * Lower the trust rating of the node that sent the request AND refuse to accept it?
     * Inform the sending server that we already have a record for that entry and let them figure it out?
     * Check the trust rating of the node that sent the request against the node that sent the initial resource for the already existing resource and update the record if the new record comes from a more trusted source?
     * Something else entirely? 


#### Resource Updates

 * Resource updates are pushed around the network. If a client receives an update for which it has more than one trusted source
 * Alternatively


#### Resource Expiration

 * Servers will periodically check on the resource.
   * Verify that it still exists.
     * Resources will expire to keep from having a needlessly large database.
   * Verify that the resource data you have matches the data your peers have.
 * Allow withdrawal of the resource from the system.
   * Resource servers will use periodically rotated keys to sign their information. These periodic keys will be signed by a master key that SHOULD be stored offline in a secure location and only accessed when required.
   * Both the master key and the periodic key SHALL be accepted to sign documents for the server
   * In the event of a hostile server takeover


#### Resource Revocation

 * In the event of an emergency
   * Server sends a signed revocation method for each subkey it wants revokes using its master key.
   * All other servers see this and immediately refuse to use the requested subkeys to update records.
   * Server generates new subkeys
   * All other servers update their records to use the new subkeys for the applicable records.",,t5_2qq4h,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/crypto/comments/163hqm/wot_and_application_to_dns_and_other_services/

a. Generate initial random data (called key) and distribute to all parties involved (i.e. same thing as normal symmetric key generation/distribution)

b. Encrypt message as follows:

1. Choose hash algorithm (called H)
2. Choose random number of iterations (called n) 
3. Generate random data (called rnd)
4. HMAC key and H n times (called derived key)
5. Ciphertext = Message XOR derived key
6. Send H

This scheme has the following benefits:

- Not vulnerable to known-plaintext attacks as easy as XOR is

- Can use the key for much longer than you can with just XOR

- Potential to be very fast (if random numbers are generated well in advance and a fast hash algorithm is chosen with a low value for n)

I believe a lot of the security of this scheme relies on the security of the chosen hash algorithm (and the strength of the random number generator used

In the first, but is important to know that all a person needs to know are the 3 and 2 (sign doesn't matter). I know prime numbers are often sought after for encryption, so I decided to go with those. At x=15, the polynomial equates to 1247, which is 29\*43. Additionally, for the equation (3x+2)(2x+1) (remember only the 3 and 2 are important), at x=15, which is 31\*47. So

3 &amp; 2 (key) //
2 &amp; 1 //
x=15 //
29 &amp; 43 = 1247 //
31 &amp; 47 = 1457 //
Because I'm using a polynomial
31 &amp; 43 = 1333 //
29 &amp; 47 = 1363 //

As for the second example

23 &amp; 13(key) //
5 &amp; 1 //
x=24 //
311 &amp; 547 = 170117 //
313 &amp; 557 = 174341 //
311 &amp; 557 = 173227 //
313 &amp; 547 = 171211 //

So what numbers could I give out that would let a person find the two numbers needed for the key

If that method is not secure enough

Edit: Here is how everything works. I'll give a very basic example then go into how it can be more complicated. It's a transposition cipher.

Let's say you have a message 32 characters in length. Take an 8x8 grid and place the first letter in the upper left slot (there are 64 slots in an 8x8 square). Now choose two different numbers that are not divisible by 4, place the next character, move down 3 slots and left 2 slots until you arrive at the upper right square again. Move to the lower left square, and place the next character, then move up 3 slots and right 2 slots until you arrive at the lower left square. Finally, move to the lower right square and place the next character, go up 3 slots and left 2 slots until you run out of characters.

An 8x8 grid can have a maximum of 32 characters placed inside using this method. You may then fill the other 32 slots with random characters (preferably the randomness is based off of letter frequency). Now create a string by removing the letters as you would if you were reading a book. This string is the ciphertext.

There are a few rules to follow using this type of transposition. First, the movement from the starting corners must be symmetric. Outside of that, you should be able to do anything you wish. For instance, if you do not need to follow the order of the corners I chose in the example. You may also move horizontally or vertically in any direction from a corner.

There are several properties to take note of:
- The patterns created by the process allow you to place copies of the grid next to each other (this isn't important)
- Different side lengths can be used
- An infinite number of dimensions may be used. If you want to use a cube and have three numbers for movement
- The patterns can be superimposed onto one another (if you created a grid from the example and didn't fill in random letters
- There is a secondary pattern created in a grid. In the example I gave
- I believe that as you include more dimensions, of the rules I mentioned above become obsolete. For instance, a 4x4x3 or 4x4x2 or 3x3x3 cube seems to work (all slots have at most one character that can be placed inside).

You may also ""pad"" a grid by placing extra rows/columns/etc. around a grid and filling them with random characters.

Anyway, though.",,False,,t5_2qq4h,1341933505.0,,

The only official word on the code (that I'm aware of) comes from Bungie employee Eric Osbourne (aka Urk) who said ""Everybody's code is different and most users will have multiple code strings issued over the course of their Reach careers.

1267130720.0,b6j7n,Block cypher ECB using hashes,dada_researcher,8,3,13,"I have implemented a block cypher and I'd like to have feedback from experts. I do not know much about cryptography.

In this algorithm the user is expected to provide a pass-phrase. The key for each block is a hash of the passphrase + a salt value + the original data from the previous block. The purpose of the hash is to generate a random looking key for each block. Then that key is XOR-ed with the data for the block. The length of each block is the length of the hash value.

Example:

Suppose the hash function gives 16 bytes. '++' means concatenation.

    DATA_BLOCK1 = first 16 bytes of data to encrypt
    BLOCK1_KEY = hash( passphrase ++ salt )
    CRYPTED_BLOCK1 = DATA_BLOCK1 XOR BLOCK1_KEY

    DATA_BLOCK2 = next 16 bytes
    BLOCK2_KEY = hash( passphrase ++ salt ++ DATA_BLOCK1 )
    CRYPTED_BLOCK2 = DATA_BLOCK2 XOR BLOCK2_KEY

etc.

To increase the safety the hash method for each block is selected from a list of functions (MD5, SHA-512, etc) using a hash of the passphrase+salt+data of previous block. This produces blocks of different lenghts in a way determined by the data, and adds more variety to the keys.

Any weaknesses?

personal data (i.e.
short
one-party situations where multiparty communication is irrelevant.

Could you please comment on and add to the following lists?

**Advantages**

1. Two levels of security: to decrypt
password protecting the private key. Without the private key
dictionary attacks are apt to be fruitless as the RSA or El Gamal key is
created from (nearly) random bytes.

2. Ease of use: if one decides to encrypt but not sign
proceeds without need for a password. Hence no password plaintext is written to
swap files

3. Authentication and integrity are optionally gained through signing after encrypting.

4. Ease of updating passwords: one does not have download - decrypt -
reencrypt - reupload data in order to update the password. One merely applies
the password change to one's private keys. Very useful where data are stored on
cloud servers.

5. One can encrypt personal data as a message for two (or more) recipients. If
one loses one's private keys or forgets one's password
can serve as a backdoor way of entry so long as you have their keys and
passwords. Of course

6. *Other advantages??*

**Disadvantages**

1. Handling a private key is burdensome where interactive keyboard entry of a
password is typical.

2. For the nonexpert user
misunderstood.

3. Symmetric encryption is integrated into software like zip
Public key encryption is not (so far as I know).

4. *Other disadvantages??*

All the code is at https://github.com/shanet/Cryptully. The relevant crypto code is at https://github.com/shanet/Cryptully/blob/master/cryptully/crypto/crypto.py. I use M2Crpyto as the library for Python.

Here's the basic details on the encryption used:

* AES is 256 bits in CBC mode with randomly generated key
* RSA is 2048 bits with a public exponent of 65537.
* RSA fingerprints are the MD5 digest of a client’s public key.
* HMAC’s are the SHA256 digest of the AES key and the encrypted message payload. The receiver calculates and verfies the HMAC before attempting to decrypt the message payload.
* Each client generates a unique RSA keypair and AES key for each connection. The exception being if the user saved an RSA keypair. Then each connection uses the same keypair
* The AES key

I was wondering what the problem with implementing the following scheme is (or

Let:

* C = Client
* S = Server
* E = Exit Node
* C*_pub_* = Client's public key
* C*_priv_* = Client's private key
* S*_pub_* = Server's public key
* S*_priv_* = Server's private key
* SymKey = randomly generated symmetric key

1. C generates a random public/private key pair for the session.
2. C sends S*_pub_*(C*_pub_*)
3. E relays information in step 2 to S
4. S decrypts with S*_priv_* to get C*_pub_*
5. S generates SymKey
6. S sends C*_pub_*(SymKey) + signature
7. E relays information in step 6 to C
8. C verifies signature and then decrypts with C*_priv_* to get SymKey

Now

Note: I left out details like C verifying that S's public key belongs to S and C sending a list of supported symmetric algorithms and hash functions to S but those would obviously be in there (left them out to make it easier to read). The use of nonces in there may help to protect against certain types of attacks but I need to think about that a bit more. 

This scheme is not backwards compatible with our current http(s) methods but I was thinking that it could be a protocol that is attempted first by the client and if the server doesn't support it the client can choose to degrade to the existing system (i.e. where the exit node can read all the traffic) or not to continue.

Am I missing something obvious here? Maybe there is a MITM attack I am not seeing?

1367968938.0,1dw8sg,Need help with theory of decrypting alphabetic based ciphers,captainskybeard,6,4,7,"Ok

So imagine you know the algorithm and are using an automated tool to brute force the key. Also suppose the plaintext is perfect English, or at a minimum assign it a probability? This needs to happen automatically without a human looking at it. Oh yeah, and it is very important (critical) that the solution is COMPUTATIONALLY ECONOMICAL. 

One note, I don't need a lecture on how insecure alphabetic substitution algorithms are.

So some basic ideas I had:

Somehow compile a list of short sets of characters (a black list) that could never exist in a string of properly formed English words

Write a formula that calculates the probability that the string is English, etc. Again, language isn't my bag, so I think I'd be pretty aimless at this. 

The less computation that is used to check the string the better. The more bad strings it can ""filter out"" the better. It doesn't have to be 100% perfect at finding the one sure fire key

I hope that makes sense. Thanks for taking some of your brain cycles to help me work this out.

wish the contents of this document made public unless and until it may
be necessary to do so to prove the above

I understand that there are various schemes for digitally signing
documents
would best suit this scenario.  It seems to me
a very simple approach that would serve.

I believe that if I encrypt the document with a symmetric cipher (AES
for example) and keep the key secret
the encrypted document and publish that hash
my need.  In this case
that it acquires evidence of the approximate time it was made public.

An old fashioned way to do this would be to put an advertisement in
a newspaper with the hash in it.  This poduces thousands of physical
copies distributed over a large geographical area
date evidence.  The more modern equivalent
it into the Cloud and let the currents carry it far and wide
more date evidence as it goes (hence

If I need to prove that I posessed the document at the time I claim
I did
hash (noting the date evidence)
encrypted document
The greater the number of disparate copies of the hash value that I track
down

""Cast it into the Cloud"" above is actually a bit glib.  It is important
to place the seed in places where it has the maximum probability of being
replicated and further distributed.  Furthermore
such a way as to maximize the chances of being able to recover one or
more credible copies when the need arises.

Hash collisions are not a great concern
would have to be not just arbitrary data that hashed to the same value
but data that also decrypted to a plausible document.  (If this existed
it would weaken my claim to the date and document
invalidate it.)

I realize this is somewhat probabilistic and sloppy in a sense
it has the advantages of not requiring a public key infrastructure
signing authorities, commercial
interests
deterministic system.  Also bear in mind that the application in question
calls for a legal standard of proof beyond a reasonable doubt
than a mathematical proof of correctness.  The required precision of
the time is also rather lax.  An accuracy of a few days would be adequate.

So I invite anyone who has borne with me this far to comment.  Am I
missing something basic.  Am I flat out wrong?  Is this just dumb?

So

According to LUKS' [FAQ](https://code.google.com/p/cryptsetup/wiki/FrequentlyAskedQuestions#5._Security_Aspects) (See 5.4)

    (keyslots x stripes x keysize) + offset bytes

Using the standard options

To get all the pieces for the calculation

    cryptsetup luksDump &lt;disk&gt;

The relevant parts of that command is

    Cipher name:               twofish
    Cipher mode:      cbc-essiv:sha256
    Payload offset:               4096
    MK bits:                       256
    AF stripes:                   4000
    Slots:                           1

So my formula looks like this:

    (1 slot * 4000 stripes * 256 bits) + 4096 = 1.028.096 bytes

However

    (1 slot * 4096 stripes * 256 bits) + 4096 = 1.052.672 bytes

I then made a header-backup using cryptsetups internal command:

    cryptsetup luksHeaderBackup --header-backup-file &lt;backup-file&gt; /dev/&lt;disk&gt;

The size of &lt;backup-file&gt; was excactly 1.052.672 bytes

Not saying they don't encode data

I was asked to reverse engineer a simple Windows executable used as part of a challenge-response protocol used for intruder alarm systems. This was trivially easy. I would like some assistance in describing the protocol/algorithm

**The protocol**

The protocol is designed to stop users resetting their alarm without contacting their alarm receiving centre.

a) When the alarm is triggered

&gt; CONTACT ARC 

&gt; QUOTE 83647

This is called the ""*quote code*"" and is always numeric and 5 digits long. I don't know how it is chosen

b) The alarm user calls the alarm receiving centre and informs them of the quote code.

c) The alarm receiving centre inputs the quote code into a piece of software (the ""decoder"") which returns the numeric 5 digit ""*reset code*"".

d) The user is informed of the ""reset code"" and inputs it into the alarm. It is accepted and the alarm is disarmed.

The alarm and alarm receiving centre share a secret which is a number from 0-255

So at a superficial level

&gt; ResetCode = F(QuoteCode

Where the QuoteCode and ResetCode are integers in the range 00000-99999 and the Version is a number between 0-255.

**Algorithm implementation**

This is my basic implementation of the algorithm used to generate the reset code given the quote code. The vector at the top is altered

    # Taken from the data in the exe
    vector = [3,5,8,1,3,9,8,5,4,9
             1,1,4,9,2,9,0,5,3,1
             1,2,8,3,3,5,2,3,2,4
             1,0,2,9,3,8,1,2,1,1

    
    def generate_reset(quote
        i = 0
        tens = 0
        reset = []
    
        while i &lt;= 4 :
            j = 0
            result = 0
    
            while j &lt;= 4:
                offset = (version + tens + quote[j]) % 256
                result = result + vector[offset]
                tens = tens + 10
                j = j + 1
    
            reset.append(result%10)
            i = i + 1
    
        return reset
    
    print(generate_reset(quote = [0,0,2], version=131))

I have run several simulations (simply by looping through all combinations of inputs)

1. The coverage of reset codes for any given version number across all quote codes is between 60-70%. This means that you have a higher than 1/10000 chance of guessing the correct reset code randomly.

2. Given a quote code and reset code

**Questions**

I hope these aren't too vague

1. What would you call the type of algorithm? To me it looks like a hash with a key - does this make it a MAC?

2. Does this specific implementation have a name? It looks very ""roll your own"" but the vendor uses the phrase ""military grade"".

3. Are there any glaring issues with this algorithm? (I'm not expecting someone to do a full analysis,False,,t5_2qq4h,False,,,t3_1eg6j5

The idea behind the Internet Education Initiative is quite straightforward and rooted deeply in the CryptoParty Handbook ([PDF](http://weise7.org/tmp/cryptobook-v1.1.pdf)).  I want to teach people about the Internet.  That includes how to use it to find reliable sources of news as well as different viewpoints on events

The Internet is one of the most valuable resources that we have today.  In fact, which can be devoid of oppression or censorship, on which people from all races and creeds can collaborate.  All of the ideas and beliefs, all of the talents and abilities, all of the minds could work together to solve all the problems of the world if we taught people to use the Internet and use it safely.

Of course, don't we?  And that's why the Internet Education Initiative is something that we need to start up.

The Internet is scary to some people, all lurking in the dark depths of the Internet.  But, the Internet is so much more than all of that -- it has so much more potential than the hands that have stained it.

Recent events only evince the malfeasance and ignorance (both terms meant in the least derogatory way possible) surrounding the Internet.  People simply don't understand it.  The Internet, Facebook, and Wikipedia and that's okay.  Those three things capture the essence of what the Internet is capable of:  the sharing of ideas, the collaboration of people, and the acquisition of knowledge.  We just need to teach people to go deeper and to do it safely.

Now, to ensure my privacy and safety, but I do not, truthfully, understand them.  That's why I'm looking for someone skilled in cryptographic practices and technologies.  In order for us to teach each others, we must first learn, and that's what the Internet Education Initiative will be all about.  Teaching people how to do things, like visiting platforms on which they can discuss and share ideas

Not only will we teach people about how to use the Internet, the Free Software Foundation, and the American Civil Liberties Union.  We'll teach people about the threats that the Internet faces and what we can do to ensure that remains a free platform.  Of course, we will aim to be as un-hyperbolic as possible, aiming to teach people with impartial information rather than feed the FUD machine.

I am a university student trying to understand a simple system used by many banks. The PINS Entry gadget. I am a bit confused and would like to read up on this more and would like to consult your help.

For this case
You need 3 things to login to your online account:

1. Membership Number 

2. Debit/Credit Card + PIN

3. PINEntry Gadget

The gadget: http://farm2.staticflickr.com/1218/1438197131_1e0d474266_z.jpg

**The process:**

1. When you log in

2. You put your card into the pinsentry and click on respond

3. Enter 8-digit respond number into the online form and login.


So this  is the process

I assume that the card holds some basic information such as the card number. The gadget itself has some sort of algorithm working with a timestamp or some sort of generator of the bank to create a 8-digit number. 

Is the same number generated on the server side as well ? If so, when there is a time difference of 5 minutes ? I can still login after 5 minutes. I could create also 20 new 8-digit numbers within that 5 minutes. Each of them would be valid. How does that work? 

Since there is no password set

I would be interested if somebody could tell me about the theory behind this and what I need to read up.

If the header is successfully decrypted (for information on how TrueCrypt determines that it was successfully decrypted, the information about the size of the hidden volume is retrieved from the decrypted header (which is still stored in RAM)

-----------


I used to work in tech support for an encryption startup called ""Authentica."" They eventually were bought out by EMC and their product didn't go anywhere.

From what I learned of encryption is that it goes letter by letter

Why not use numbers to words encryption though? Can anyone tell me if this is not a better way? Basically, the number is the key, the word is the value), and write an algorithm so that each time a word repeats, it uses a second and third and fourth string of numbers so you can't crack it based on repeating number patterns.

You keep the encryption/decryption software on computers that are not connected to the Internet

it seems to me this would be harder to crack than encrypting letter by letter.
