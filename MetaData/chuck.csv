Finding the show Chuck was one of the very few comforts I had in those trying times. I’ve had an interesting exciting and eventful life, physically, mentality, everything about me was low. I didn’t know who I was, where I was going, or what I wanted, I resorted to drinking Jack every night to numb and dull the pain and discovering Chuck was something that gave me joy and laughter. To me, but I want you to know

Now with the ending of Chuck not 10 minutes past, its done, and finished. There won’t be another season, and with how I’ve gradually got over a lot of my issues, and working on more, with the ending of Chuck it almost feels like its helped me weather one of the worst parts of my life. You could say I’m putting to much thought and feeling into just a TV show, and you’d be right, but at this moment I’m very sad and also ready to begin a new part of my life. Does a TV make me say this? No, I can’t help but think, its time to pick my path

Thank you Chuck for being one of the very few comforts that had helped guide me through a tough spot.

edit:I am somewhat of a poet

**Down a long and winding road, and thoughts of doubt, will she remember, or forever be without. I hoped and prayed this day never came, but now its here, so I'll smile all the same.**

Okay

Around the start of December last year: I am in the midst of my work placement as a student nurse. During my placement I had been having some pretty horrible days at work; to use an example

After one particularly horrible shift

I hardly need to describe how great the show is to a sub-reddit that is dedicated to it but oh my goodness, the first 10 minutes of the episode. I was like: I have truly come across something that is completely and totally ‘awesome’. I think I watched the first 5 episodes in one sitting. I mean, I couldn’t remember the last time a show like Chuck made me laugh and cry and feel so much emotion for the characters. I loved how much I could relate to Chuck and often felt like I was going through not only the same insecurities, self-doubt and lack of self-confidence but also the growth. Needless to say but Chuck really helped me get through my placement. 

It is kind of funny because I actually managed to get my family to watch the show with me too. I would definitely say that Chuck has been a major factor in helping me reconnect and communicate with my family. I mean I was close to my family but it wasn’t until we started watching Chuck that I began to appreciate them and who they were as people. 

After my placement (during which, but also to take care of myself physically and mentally. I know this sounds really lame but ever since I started watching Chuck, I have started to feel a lot better myself. I've actually taken steps to improve my life and to live it the way I want to live it. I’m putting myself out there; trying out new things and meeting new people. Signed up for a training course next month; gonna catch a plane by myself to see relatives in another state and going to sit my drivers exam to get my license in a couple of weeks. 

Now I’m on Season 5 and just finished ""Chuck versus the Business Trip"". I’m really sad knowing that I am just nine episodes away from the finale and that Chuck’s and Sarah’s adventures are soon coming to an end. But it's a new year and I'm ready to take life and 2013 into my own hands. Chuck really has made my life better and a lot more brighter.

I will never forget watching it for the first time. I joined the party late, Chuck vs. The Suburbs holds a special place in my heart. The whole show does really.

This show has been there for me. It helped me through tough times and never failed to make me smile. I fell in love with these characters and the stories. Chuck became a part of my life. No show made me happier. No show ever impacted me as much. I have no shame admitting that I have cried like a baby multiple times watching this show. 

What this show meant to me didn't hit until the last 4 minutes of it ever. I began to sob uncontrollable in a combination of happiness and sadness. I feel like I am mourning

Thank you to everyone, we supported this show. We rooted for Chuck and Sarah and sang along with Jeffster and grunted with Casey and did the ""Morgan"". It doesn't matter if you have been here since day one or just started watching last week. You were apart of the best thing that has ever happened to television. As sad as it is that Chuck had to end, be happy that we had a chance to watch it at all. A chance to live and love it. And we still do.

Chuck, Ellie, Awesome, Morgan, Alex, Jeff, and Lester will forever live on in our hearts. We will never let go. We went along on the best ride possible. I loved this show every second it was on,,False,t3_p06b1

1327821635.0,p1hvp,Chuck's Pilot vs. The Finale -- some thoughts from a day one fan.,Teotwawki69,42,5,25,"A little disclosure here – I’ve spent time in the trenches of TV, so I know how TV works. One great lesson I learned from an excellent executive producer who was wrapping up a series was this: To write the finale, in effect

Just a few striking things. Finale: In the DARPA sequence, it is almost a shot-for-shot remake of Bryce Larkin’s original escape from DARPA. Additionally, the bomb she plants outside of the Intersect room is the same bomb that Larkin plants inside the room, and the way it looks after destruction is pretty much identical. (Indeed, it looks like the intersect room was even shot on the same location, except that the walls, floor, we meet Graham, but it, built on the same plan. To paraphrase Jon Hurt in *Contact*

The relationship between Chuck and Sarah in the Pilot also echoes their relationship in the finale. She is pretending to be interested in him at first, although she’s in disguise – in effect, the equivalent of her orders from Quinn in the first half of the finale to kill him. To top that off, she is given orders to kill Chuck if necessary in her downtown apartment, just before she opens the green door to greet him before their first “date” – an identical shot, and in the same location, to the one just before she wakes up after losing her memory to open the door to Quinn in the set-up to the first half of the finale.

Sarah’s arc in the pilot is to go from emotionless agent sent out to deal with collateral damage any way possible but, and this brings up a really nice irony. The big issue we begin with (it’s the opening shot) is Chuck and Morgan trying to ditch Chuck’s own birthday party (so the character’s canonical birthday is September 24) because Ellie has taken it as an opportunity to invite all of her women doctor friends, in order to fix Chuck up with someone. However, it becomes clear that Chuck doesn’t know how to talk to women, and winds up driving them away. Although Sarah is far hotter and younger than any of the women at his party, he has no problem talking to her, but he doesn’t realize it. From our point of view, he doesn’t realize this once he finds out that she’s CIA

Now, the same beach), and it’s an emotional reversal of their last conversation in the finale. Sarah tries to convince Chuck that he has to trust her, but he’s not ready for that yet. 

The other notable bits from the pilot are how much the other characters have changed. From the beginning, and second his mission is to bring in Chuck (even if it means locking him in solitary forever) and to kill Sarah, although he winds up letting Sarah live and working undercover at the Buy More at the end of the pilot. Morgan is super-creepy -- this is when he had a major crush on Ellie, and he even takes his bromance with Chuck a little bit too far a couple of times. Ellie is way too possessive of Chuck (the big lesson she learns in the series is letting go) and Devon “Captain Awesome” Holcombe is still just a cardboard pretty-boy stereotype. Big Mike has only one wordless scene, and hasn’t evolved into a likeable character yet, and we have two blasts from the past – Lester’s love-interest Anna, and Chuck’s Buy More nemesis, and that comes back big time once Scott Bakula/Orion appears.

So… after watching the pilot again

TL;DR: Watched pilot right after finale. Everything from the ending was there from the beginning. Everything that happened was always all about the characters.",self,t5_2r4nd,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/chuck/comments/p1hvp/chucks_pilot_vs_the_finale_some_thoughts_from_a/

1351989442.0,12l90x,"Why the extended version of the final episode made me more of a believer in ""Morgan's Magical Kiss""",KBooks66,33,2,14,"So I hadn't watched Chuck since the final episode aired. I bought the bluray the day it came out but couldn't bring myself to watch it. I finally watched the season this weekend and realized that Morgan's magical kiss theory was right.

Maybe I am crazy but I believe that when they kissed on the beach her memories came back

The reason why I believe this are because of what happened with Morgan. At the beginning of the season as you all know Morgan had the intersect and because of it started losing his memories and losing who it was. During this process Sarah and Ellie didn't believe that Morgan had changed but there was something wrong with him. When it became apparent what was wrong Ellie kept stressing that a strong emotional stimulus may trigger the real Morgan that was inside the douchey exterior. Eventually it did the story of Moran getting pantsed and how they got back at the girl that did it got Morgan back.

Sarah however was further lost than morgan, and Awesome had not given up on this theory. In the extended edition they had attempted the video montage, however that was not enough. Morgan and the factors surrounding the last mission stressed this as well, Morgan telling chuck to make this the most romantic mission ever, telling chuck to keep telling their story to her, the fact that every place they went (the restaurant, the consulate dinner, the concert hall) were all places that held strong emotions for chuck and sarah.

These places didn't bring sarah but clearly those emotional stimuli were getting through to her. She was remembering small things and potentially remember emotions. Several of the parts that were cut from the final episode were just transitions in a lot of these transitions you have chuck tell sarah an emotional story or tell her something about himself and has sarah is walking away you see her smirk. They are one of those smirks that you saw through the first few seasons where you knew sarah was falling for chuck. These deleted transitions made it seem to me that Sarah was coming back however the emotional stimuli were not strong enough. Even when she is leaving castle and chuck was about to tell her Morgan's kiss the girl theory

This takes us to the final scene on the beach, the story we all love. Then at the end of it when Chuck finally tells her Morgan's theory she wants him to kiss her. She might not be fully sarah then but there is clearly something inside her that knows she is meant to be with chuck. 

Finally there is the kiss, but Sarah regained who she was, who she evolved into throughout the series. We did get that happy ending we all wanted for chuck. 

Plus Morgan

B. I thought Zachary Levi's acting in particular was amazing in the last couple episodes. The scene where he was begging Sarah to remember in their dream home had me shedding (manly) tears. 

C. The idea of Sarah falling in love with Chuck all over again

D. Something that struck me is just how well the last couple episodes highlighted Chuck's growth as a person. Chuck from Season 1, would have just given up on life when Sarah lost her memory and tried to kill him. But when he was begging Sarah to remember, he didn't say something like ""You might as well just shoot me"" or anything like that, he said ""You'll never see me again."" Basically it just highlighted to me how much he's grown up over the past 5 years as a character. 

E. Somewhat related to the last point, but, still seems to have some truth to it.

So, really bugged me about it is the fact that Morgan never got his any of his memory back - to the point that he had to rewatch such classic movies as Star Wars. So, then... Why would Sarah's magically start coming back?

However, when the quartet is at the DARPA facility, Morgan goes and starts playing with the Invisibility Cloak. When he does so, though, he makes direct references to both Harry Potter (""You're a wizard, Harry"") and The Fugitive (""It was the one-armed man!"").

1373392088.0,1hy4xk,A leap of faith.,heymrk,29,3,4,"I often see the ending of Chuck as a point of contention among fans. As a society

Before we get started, a *trope* is a common or overused theme or device, or a word or expression used in a figurative sense. There's a third, archaic definition which has nothing to do with what I'm trying to say.

But what if those tropes are challenged? Most people tend to rebel because the simple idea of contradicting a trope attacks the basis of human storytelling-- that fantasy is preferable to real life, he paid penance to Poseidon for his attitude, but he still made it home.

So I look at the ending of Chuck as one of those attacks on a trope. But I see beauty in it. I see possibility.

It makes me look back to another series-- a series that Chuck is

I knew the outcome

Sam never gets home.

This final episode is beautiful. It's even more beautiful to me than the ending of Chuck. Not just because both series attack social tropes

Both shows aired on NBC. Both shows had the captain of the Enterprise. Less known

Now, vampires, the devil and Bigfoot, along with exploring conspiracy theories about the Kennedy assassination (and ruin the show's theme with a terrible remix), but was overall, a very solid show. Then the two shows have such a similar, trope-defying ending. It makes me shiver how history can repeat itself so beautifully.

So let's talk about the way Quantum Leap ended.

Sam spends the episode in a bar outside of Pennsylvania, both prior to and during the Quantum Leap project. At the end, he returns to a singular moment at the end of the second season and makes a decision.

To go back from that, the stage performance of Don Quixote. During that leap, he ran into his own piano teacher. His first crush. A woman who was too old for him. But when he leaped into the performer, they were age appropriate for each other.

Al warned Sam that he was breaking one of his own rules about time travel-- *never do anything to improve your own situation.*

He slept with the woman anyway.

It wasn't the only time he acted in his own interests. He saved his brother's life in Vietnam. There were other incidents I'm not able to remember at the moment.

But the one time Al needed him-- *truly needed him*-- Sam stood fast to his rules. While Al was in Vietnam

Al stood by Sam time and time again, there were other moments where Sam didn't do what Al felt was right, but this was the big one. Throughout the entire series, the relationship was all take from Sam, and the moment Al needed Sam, that same capacity to give was nowhere to be found.

That isn't to say Sam is a bad person-- not by a long shot. As established by the last episode

When Sam realizes he can leap where he wants

In that moment, but he made his mistake up to Al.

Al is Sancho Panza to Sam's Don Quixote. In the story, think the windmills were dragons, the goal was to retain nobility in a world that considered it outdated.

Sancho Panza stood by his lord's side, but stuck to him anyway because it was both his job and the right thing to do. Panza did everything asked of him by Don Quixote and asked nothing in return.

There is a moment in the third season where Al leaps and Sam ends up in the imaging chamber, knowing full well he could end up back in the same situation as before. He takes the risk to save Al's life, but justifies it for the sake of completing the mission. It's an important growth moment for Sam, because he's changing his relationship with Al. If I'm not mistaken, this is the episode where Sam admits that Al is his best friend.

Quantum Leap teaches us that friendship is everything. You can make the world as good a place as you want

This is the thing about Chuck. The ending to this show frustrated fans because it was unclear if Sarah got her memory back through some reverse Superman II-type kiss. Whether she did or not is irrelevant to the situation. What doesn't change is the journey there.

In the final scene of Quantum Leap, even though it always stayed on his mind. But for Al, because he does get to go home-- he does get Beth. And if you think about it, there is a happy ending for Quantum Leap. But it isn't Sam's. It's Al's.

So in Chuck

Prior to meeting Sarah, believe that she never regains her memory (after all, Morgan didn't). By losing her memory, it created the start of a new journey *where she could be completely his* and *without the baggage and secrets of the spy game.* They could start fresh. That's their journey. That's their river and road. Their love is stronger than memories in *the head,* but in *the heart.*

Unlike Quantum Leap

If you're going to challenge a trope, did so *incredibly* well.",,False,self,t5_2r4nd,False,,

Chuck was great for a number of reasons...the humor, the missions, the one-liners, Jeffster, the buy more, Subway, the music

But what I really felt myself latching onto was the portrayal of family, and we as the audience root for them to get over their flaws.  But Chuck, his family, his wife, and his friends were all so archetypal.  They bond they shared with each other was stronger than any bond, real or dramatized, that I have ever seen.  They lived for each others' safety, and happiness.  I'd be hard pressed to find anyone who has ever experienced a community as selfless and as others-focused as the Bartowskis.

So, more passionate in our service to those in need, or those we just call friends.  I hope we can create a world where this kind of love isn't just an exception, but it is the rule.

_________________________


As we all know
The story wasn't always what it could be
So let's analyze the show through the character development:

***(TL;DR) It's longer than I expected. If you want to get to the good stuff immediately I'd suggest to start reading at Ellie or Sarah.***

**Chuck**:

* MISSION: Get his life back on track
* REPORT: As Chuck tries to get his *shit* together
Chucks character development comes to an end at the end of season 4: he doesn't have the intersect but he got the girl (married Sarah)
* CRITIQUE: If the show ended on season 4, we can speculate 
on what happens next


**Morgan**:

* MISSION: Grow up
* REPORT: Morgan leaves his toys behind
* CRITIQUE: None


**Casey**:

* MISSION: Learn to love again
* REPORT: Casey struggles with the concept of love and care, he slowly befriends Morgan/allows him to date his daughter and we find out about his love interest - Gertrude Vebanski.
* CRITIQUE: None, to go find Gertrude.

**Awesome**:

* MISSION: Be awesome
* REPORT: Is awesome
* CRITIQUE: none


**Ellie**:

* MISSION: Let go of Chuck
* REPORT: Once she and Devon get married they decide to move out
* CRITIQUE: None

* *SIDE QUEST*: Become Orion 2.0
* *SIDE QUEST REPORT*: In season 4 Ellie's main focus is on Her dads (Orion) laptop after she finds it analyzing some clues her dad left her in the newspaper. Even the NSA director shows interest in Ellie
* *SIDE QUEST CRITIQUE*: In season 5 this part of Ellie's life comes to an abrupt, but they made it a huge item in season 4, so it seemed way more important.



**Sarah**:

* MISSION: Learn to love
* REPORT: Of all people
love, we know who her father is,..


* Weird to say but we know almost nothing about this main protagonist. 
With the end of season 4 nearing
We finally get to see the world through Sarahs eyes.
Her character development reaches a peak when we learn about her mother and the baby in season 5.
* CRITIQUE: If the show ended on Season 4, but this isn't needed at the time, season 5 created that need. Now this is where stuff goes horribly wrong. The writers just made us feel closer to Sarah, we felt way closer to her then we ever did (the house, suggestion of children and their names, her mother &amp; the baby) and then they decided to throw away that special connection. It was a genius but devastating move from the writers: they gave us a unique, beautiful ending. They knew that this was how they could make us remember Chuck for the rest of our lives. Look at me it's been half a year since I saw the last episode and here I am writing this huge text completely on my own will. If they went ahead and gave us the ending we all wanted, we'd just move on to the next TV show and forget about Chuck. It's a cruel thing to do, this is how you keep a fanbase alive. This is why people want a Chuck movie to happen

_______________________________
**Final thoughts** -- *My Opinion*:

Season 5 was not a bad season

You can't blame it on NBC this time

Because of all this, the writers made the story incomplete. They even went as far as hinting to a follow-up by giving General Beckman the following line: 
&gt;""*dramatic pause*  - If you ever want to save the world again

I'm not posting this to make you hope for a Chuck follow-up - if it happens
If you want to make it happen, something could happen, just give it some time, nothing good ever comes from rushing things, how badly we want it or not, we don't want to see Chuck go full retard.

I just want to know If or if there is not a Chuck movie coming out how would you write the plot and what characters would you use? 

I have been thinking about this ever since the possibility of a movie happening and I think if I were to write the plot I would use where the series finale left off, I would use a sort of flash back where words said or certain places make her flash to that part of her memory. This would make for a good time to relive the moments all Chuck fans love and hated, but would also serve as a gap filler for all the new viewers of Chuck. These flash backs would also be a part of how Sarah questions her time with Agent Cole, Agent Shaw, Fulcrum, The Ring and Volkoff.

During all of this Morgan is thinking of proposing to Alex

Everything is happy and everyone would be brought up to speed at this point besides having the known location of Agent Casey. Chuck

Agent Shaw is now on the run and planning something big. He still wants his revenge but more on a global scale, where Sarah had the badass fight scenes in the pit. They inform Casey about how Agent Shaw is on the loose and they need him back. He just replies with a grunt and joins them. Back at Burbank, Beckman informs that security cameras saw Shaw traveling to Chicago. Chuck realized that his sister is there and they need to go there asap. During there travels to Chicago, Morgan will ask Casey if he could marry his daughter. Casey just gives him the cop face. Chuck calls Awesome and tells him not to freak out, but Agent Shaw has escaped. Awesome of course freaks out and is not Awesome. When Chuck arrives at Ellies house, she quickly realizes something is not right and immediately interrogates Chuck. Chuck tells her not to freak out but he believes Shaw is somewhere in Chicago. Chuck then says ""Ellie we have to go where are Devon and Claira?"". Ellie replies with a ""They are running errands"" The house they live in blows up when they are leaving and Shaw is standing from a distance staring. 

Everyone is now heading back to Burbank to report back to Beckman on what happened, they gather intel the Agent Shaw is in a underground old Ring base where he was resurrected and received the intersect. (This did not get blown up, at least to my knowledge). Shaw runs the intersect program version 3.0 again knowing that there were bugs in it, but does not care because he wants to destroy Sarah and Chuck.

During Team Bartowskis mission it is revealed the General Beckman has been working with Ellie on the intersect program, Morgan proposes to Alex after the fight scene and Chuck being the hospital (Think of Sarah and Chucks proposal scene). Chuck wakes up finds out Ellie has a new intersect, Shaw is officially dead and he has to decide on either removing the intersect out of his head, or restoring Sarah's memories. Chuck being Chuck he just steps on the glasses and tells Sarah that even though some of her memories are gone, he and her have made new ones to replace those old ones and will (remember his vows) everyday prove to her that he loves her. They kiss, and flash forward to 6 months. Morgan and Alex have there wedding, Awesome and Ellie move back to Burbank, and finally Chuck and Sarah are happy together out of the spy life and in there dream home (thanks to General Beckman and her generous gift). The last scene will be a prego stick that has a a plus sign or whatever to tell the audience that a little Charah is on the way.

I would also like to add that there will be cameos of Sarah's mom, Jeffster, Big Mike and the Buy More. I just don't know how I would write them in. ",,False,self,t5_2r4nd,,http://www.reddit.com/r/chuck/comments/qbmsu/chuck_movie_self_written_plots/

- Jeff

- Ellie expresses concern about Chuck

- Someone mentions Fulcrum or The Ring

- Buy More suffers collateral damage.  (credit to demented_pants)

- The courtyard outside Chuck's apartment is shown.

- A kiss happens.

**TAKE A SHOT WHEN:**

- Sarah uses a weapon other than a gun

- Cat fight

- Chuck actually obeys Sarah, etc and STILL gets into trouble...

- Casey interacts with his Reagan photo (credit to demented_pants)

- Captain Awesome says that something is ""Awesome"".

- Jeff drinks

- A love interest shows up for anybody

- For the first flash of a character in an episode (Sip a beer for every subsequent flash)

- Subway is mentioned

- A recurring guest character shows up. (Carina, Shaw, Jill, Orion, Ted Roark, Mary, The Awesomes

- A guest character played by a celebrity (Half-shot if said celebrity plays a recurring character.  Otherwise

- If said celebrity references a previous role, Casey referencing Firefly that one time counts too..., Do the mannerisms of the Old Spice Guy [Greta #2] count as a reference?)

- Chuck says ""Waitwaitwaitwaitwait"" (credit to luke727)

- Chuck says ""Hoooh Hoooh Hoooh...""

- An operative of The Ring/Fulcrum/Volkoff shows up (Exception being ""Chuck vs. The Suburbs"".  Don't drink for this one.  I mean

- Chuck and/or Morgan talk about something from ""Nerd/Geek Culture"" (Star Wars

**FINISH YOUR DRINK WHEN:**

- Chuck and Sarah go through their whole ""I love you

- Someone other than Chuck, Awesome)

- A major character or recurring villain dies (""fake deaths"" count too.  i.e. Bryce Larkin in the Pilot) 

- Said character comes back from the dead (credit to demented_pants)",self,t5_2r4nd,True,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/chuck/comments/p3hl0/chuck_the_drinking_game_or_chuck_vs_alcohol/

1369813009.0,1f9954,What the hell was the point of Season 5?,Vaethin,27,13,24,"All in all

Ok

* Sara and Chuck storyline is at an end: They are in love

* The Volkoff storyline has ended (obviously)
* The Chuck's parents storyline has ended: Chuck knows about his parents and the fact that his mother is at the wedding kind of finalizes that everything is ""okay"" now.
* The wedding was the finale we all had hoped for, I was laughing, I was crying. Everything was perfect.

Then Morgan picks up the intersect and everything goes to shit.

Season 5: 

* Since every storyline was closed new ones are introduced. This leads to the writers having to just ""make something up"": Everything that is being done is irrelevant to previous seasons and since Season 5 was always to be a last season they don't have the depth either. In the end we have a very anti-climatic stand-off between Quinn and Chuck that feels rushed and forced. Did I mention it feels like Chuck actually loses to him in the end?
* Talking about the ending: By taking away Sarah's memories the whole series just loses a big part of it's strengths: Chracter development. In a lot of series we have characters basically moving on the spot
* The morgan storyline. I mean come on, bla bla, that does not change the way the adience percieved him. Morgan was a sidekick and he should've stayed a sidekick. 
* Generally speaking I feel like the quality in writing and production went down by A LOT in season 5. This may be subjective but it was just the feeling I got from it. It felt forced and rushed and frankly a part of me wants to believe that it was forced. I just don't want to believe that season 5 was the ending that the creators had envisioned when they made the series.

Also, and whatever spiritual pattycake nonsense Morgan and Alex were up to, all of it was great.  Plus, Casey's reaction to it all.

I showed the first 7 episodes of Arrested Development to my wife. She hated ALL of them. She finds the character too pathetic to be likable and doesn't like ""humiliation humor""

She used to hate Buster's character in Chuck finding him the oddest character in the full 3 seasons of Chuck so far. She hates Buster even more.

However

We've only watched 2 episodes yet. She loved the pilot

The only problem with Dexter so far is that episodes last over 52 minutes

On my own level


**UPDATE - August 23rd - UPDATE **


---------------------------------------


My wife is very difficult to please with television. 

I am trying to find a TV show to watch with her once we are caught up with Chuck.

------------------------------------
**What she watched and didn't like**

She got bored of True Blood in season 1

She liked Doctor Who, but it took several attempts to get through TorchWood season 1. We watched a lot of 30 Rock together but at some point she lost interest in it.

She watched the first 3 seasons of Big Love

She watched a few episodes of Bullshit! when the subject interested her

She used to love Dead Zone and saw the first 3 seasons or so

She saw the first season of house and decided to never watch it again even under duress.

She saw a lot of episodes of Being Erica and loved it at first but in the second season gave up finding it unbelievable because Erica wasn't progressing at all emotionally despite her therapy.

She loves the Simpsons but hates Futurama and South Park.

She loved the first 3 seasons of Kyle XY but I hated the last one and decided not to subject her to it.

She loves Scrubs and almost saw episode with JD still in it. Doesn't want to see the last season and I can't blame her.

She got me to watch Prison Break

After 4 or 5 episodes of L O S T 5 years ago she told me : ""The writers have no idea where they are going. This looks like a mystery show, she was right.

----------------------------------------------
**Why she loves Chuck**

Chuck on the other hand

She loves how the action moves, the way the spy action is mixed with the Buy More and Chuck's personal life.

She found Season 2 better than season 1

----------------------------------------
**Why am I looking for another show**

We quite enjoy spending time together to watch TV shows as it helps us disconnect from our day work and help us get closer afterwards. It's a pause in our stress.

So

Shows without any sort of romantic twists need something else to get her interesting. For example

--------------------------------------
**Possible Choices**

I am thinking of the following shows

- Warehouse 13
- The IT Crowd
- The rest of Californication (the current default choice
- Arrested Development (but I am not sure she'll like the humor)
- Weeds
- Royal Pains
- Dollhouse
- Human Target
- Krod Mandoon (but since it's only 6 episodes
- Second and Third season of TorchWood

---------------------------------
**Ideas I have rejected**

I do not think the following shows would be a good match for various reasons:

- Lie to me (I am sure she will hate Dr Lightman)
- Castle: she doesn't like murder mysteries
- Buffy (she hated the movie)
- Community: not her style of humor
- Pushing Daisies : told her about it and it didn't interest her
- FlashPoint : tried several time to get her into it.

Is there any gems I have forgotten ?

The show had turned me on to a lot of music I otherwise would have never heard of.  Here's a list (top of my head) of songs I've purchased after hearing them on Chuck.  My question is what are some other ones I sould be looking in to.  Thanks

Short Skirt/Long Jacket - Cake
Kettering - The Antlers
Wannamama - Pop Levi - My 6 yr old loves this one!
Love You More Than I do - Band of Horses
Blood Bank - Bon Iver

Sarah is going to have to go about remembering everything on her own, etc, etc.

What's kind of sad is that Chuck has the intersect all over again.  Is that going to be the only thing that will get Sarah to fall in love with him all over again?  I do wan't to point out that it was very clever of the writers to show that chuck is kind of screwed when it comes to getting away from the intersect.  It's just going to follow him everywhere.  I like that.  

Also, would Quinn have taken it out of her?  How would he have been able to do that?  Did he just flash it out of her?  

And


They have given us a happy ending every time they expected to have had to end the show.


End of season 2 chuck got the cooler intersect: ""I know kung fu""


Midway through season 3: Chuck and Sarah get together and are happy


End of Season 3 was just set up with the thought of going into 4.


End of season 4 was the same thing


Why now, something I never even expected.  They deserve a lot of credit for that.  Im convinced that they had already used up all their happy endings.  Maybe they just wanted to be different.  As a viewer you will never get the satisfactions that everything will turn out okay, even if it is implies that Sarah has a good chance at remember Chuck all over again.  All Chuck would really have to do is give Sarah her spy will thing, take Sarah to visit her mom, dad, and anyone else that saw them together.  Im sure the CIA/Beckman would have no problem helping Chuck and Sarah get her memory back. 

If they made a movie

Good show all around.  Been a fun 5 years.  Really glad they got to give it a proper ending.  Even if it had an unexpected

Other thoughts:

* Rob Riggle was perfectly cast as Agent Rye and so was Summer Glau (*cough*FIREFLY*cough*) as this week's Greta
* It was awesome to see a softer side to Casey
* The brief grunting match between Greta and Casey was so awesome.


*My crackpot theory:*

There was no independent confirmation of The Belgian's nefarious nature other than Rye's word.

Who knows. But it was this ambiguity that left me to wonder, will the Sarah we know come back, or will she feel like a different Sarah with all these memories of someone else?

So, and how unusual it was that she was so adamant about getting her memories back. Why? She stated she didn't 'feel it' and wanted to tell Chuck a proper goodbye, so it leaves me confused. Does she deep down inside love a man she barely knows (at this point, near the ending), or is it that she wants her memories back? I like to think that due to my personality if I lost all my memories and was told I had fallen in love with some girl, I would want to find my own path and not be told what I did, if that makes sense.

NBC always questions why they dont do great in the ratings or have good shows.  Well they seem to not either promote shows well, and other well known and established shows.  For example they just cancelled a show after 2 seasons(Harry's Law) and it was one of there highest rated shows in the last year or so. Chucked seemed to be doing good.
