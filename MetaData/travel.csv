But you’re totally crazy.” Most of my friends actually value their life savings since they have mortgages

I bought a one-way ticket to Auckland

I have absolutely no idea what I'm doing. I've been out of the country before

What should I buy before I leave? I already bought a backpack

How many weeks of clothing should I pack? I was thinking one or two weeks.

I have friends who say I need get vaccination shots before I go. However, or are my friends just being overly cautious.

Which countries do I need a visa? How do I go about getting one? Will it be hard to get a visa when I don’t have a set itinerary?

Any fun places you would suggest on that side of the world? The only thing I know about that side of the world is that a Kiwi is a person

Any suggestions will be greatly appreciated. Hopefully this will give me comfort when I start freaking out that I quit a well-paying job and booked a one-way ticket to the other side of the world.


TL:DR – Early midlife crises

EDIT: Wow! Thanks for all the great advice everyone. Way more than I ever expected.

I sang along with them and we actually drew a bit of a crowd and they made decent money.  When they stopped they offered me a share and I said no they could keep it.  Then they asked if I wanted to go to a party with them and keep singing songs.  I said why not and we went to a party in an apartment and sang songs and had a great time.

I have been a couchsurfing host for a little over a year now
  
1. *Write a personalized couch request to your desired host(s).* It makes such a huge difference to me when I can tell someone took the time to read my profile and decide that we would get along well. Those people are always my best guests. 
1. *Be clear about when you're arriving and how you'll be arriving.* I know you're traveling, dude. You're staying at my house FOR FREE! The least you could do would be to communicate with me. If you do, I will tell you the best directions by bus, plane, train, or car, and your life will be that much easier.
1. *Have an idea of at least one thing you'd like to do in the city OR give me a good idea about what you're into.* When people show up with no idea
1. *Be prepared to do some things alone.* I love to hang out with my surfers and show them around the city, so I just wanted to mention it. 
1. *If you can, though. It means so much when you go that extra step. It's certainly not required, but it's much appreciated.  
1. **PLEASE** *If you can't make it, and I find it kind of offensive. I'm opening up my house to you. Have some decency. I had one couple that were on a bike trip that was a few hundred miles long that were supposed to stay a few days. Halfway through the week there was a snow storm, and I got really worried. They never called and never showed. I was calling them for two weeks to make sure they were okay. Finally, they answered and said they found someone nice in Maryland and decided to stay for 6 months. Really?? You couldn't just call me?  
  
This concludes my couchsurfing tutorial! If anyone has any other comments or advice, and sign up! Your travel experience will improve dramatically.

I had just laid down for the night in Istanbul


Soon it started raining and I came prepared


After a couple of minutes the rain got worse and he asked me if he could borrow some space under the sheet. Since I already felt bad for not inviting him, or maybe he took it for granted that my acceptance also included sharing my sleeping pad which is barely big enough for me alone. 


He didn't speak english very well so it would have been hard to communicate to him that I only ment the sheet, he slowly moved closer to me and I slowly away from him. It didnt take long before I didn't have anymore sleeping pad to move away from him on. So naturally I tilted up on my side to take less space. It didnt stop him and he continued to move towards me until I was spooning him. (He was moving towards me with his ass first).


When we were spooning I placed my head on my hand supported by my elbow, but still. I gently placed his hand back and didn't know if he did it on purpose or not because of the snoring. After that I heard him unbuckle his pants, which was too much for me. 


He seemed upset at me for not giving him my number before kicking him out.

For those curious

* **Edit 1**: I've been disconnected twice going through to the Duty Officer in Oaxaca and have yet to actually speak with the Officer. I was once routed to the Mexico City office to find out that if the last known location was Oaxaca to best use that office, a Luara, and Jeremy on the line they put me through. I've waited up to 20minutes on hold to reach the Oaxaca field Duty Officer to be disconnected. Very anxious.

If any viewers/readers who have accounts/access to forums/sites Kiel's visited or posted on please share the news at those locations. I'm not aware of all the locations Kiel has been sharing his stories outside his blog.

* **Edit 2**: I've been told he frequented the www.expeditionportal.com forums under the username Wiley. He's tracked his progress in this [thread](http://www.expeditionportal.com/forum/threads/58432-2Guys1Truck-Astro-Van-through-Central-and-South-America-March-2012/page3) which is almost a mirror of his blog.

* **Edit 3**: I've been contacted by his mother with this message ""Thanks for your help. We have called the U.S. Embassy in Oaxaca. The process has been started. We will keep you updated. Thanks for your help and concern. Kiel's mom."" Let's hope its just bad communcation circumstances he's lost touch.

* **Edit 4**: In a holding pattern at the moment. Getting feedback on my postings here and r/mexico. Trying to see who can help and what info they need.

* **Edit 5**: Odd turn of events. My brother who's traveled a lot in his lifetime has a contact in Mexico. She's a friend he made while spending time in Cape Verde

* **Edit 5**: Some good news. Apparently he was in touch with a friend via email sometime around the 5th. Don't know the exact date

* **Final Edit**: Kiel has been contacted. As suspected, it appears others already have. ;-) At least his family can rest easy now.",,False,self,t5_2qh41,1345562680.0,,

[Post trip cost analysis per day in excel](https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B91ptWRJo41hZElRT1M5SkxsTGM/edit?pli=1) 


**Statistics:**

Roughly 9086 miles driven (14622.5km)

Roughly 147 hours in the car (6 days)

Duration of trip was 48 days

The mean spediture for two people (in USD):

Misc (Gifts, parking etc) - $569.53

Beer (Any alochol- buying drinks out or a case of beer) - $744.75

Food (Grocery store or dining out) - $405.29

Sleeping (Camp site

Gas (Petro) - $979.02

**Total Cost - $2992.59**



**Car**

Vechile used was a 1998 Jeep Cherokee with 110
-Checked fluids weekly
-No problems but be weary that the Regular octane gas in some Western/Mid-Western states is less that 87. You will have to fill up on Plus for no engine problems.



**Beer**

Bars are expensive but that is where you meet the locals. We knew this from the get go so we factored it in our budget. If you don't don't go out at night you can cut a lot of additional expenses 



**Sleep**

We brought a Eureka Tetragon 7 tent for car camping. 

We each used a Therm-a-Rest Ridge Rest Solar sleeping pad

We used a Go-Lite Down Fleece and REI Travel down sleeping bag

We mostly stayed in campsites. It was spilt 50/50 between pay sites and disperse camping (You can camp legally for free in National Forrests)

We stayed in 4 hostels (New Orleans Lousiana, Vancouever, Canada)

We stayed in 2 hotels (Las Vegas, Oregon)

We stayed with friends or family 5 times (Bay of St Louis, Texas, Los Angelels, California, Lake Tahoe, California, Seattle



**Eat**

We went to a wholesale groccer (In the US the largest are Costco

Staple luch and or dinner were:

Lipton side dish of noodles or rice with a can of tuna

Ramen noddles (I don't use the death packet) with chicken

Mashed potatoes with chicken

Used spices, and olive oil to enhance dishes

Snacks were jerky, candy, fruit cups (We went through all the snacks in 2 weeks. It was something to do driving so we didn't resupply)

Peanut Butter and ritz crackers or tortias

Gatorade powder

We got ice a few times only to bring Wisconsin cheese back to family

We ate out in big cities to famous places or with friends or to try the local cuisine. And after long treks
We stopped at Grocery stores and Subway to try to get some veggies in

We used a propane car camping stove to cook everything in a 2 quart pot



**Gear**

We are big into backpacking and hiking

Pack was a Talon 44 and High Sierrra 45

We brought a Tarptent Contrail and Six Moon Designs Skyscape Scout for back country camping 

We each used a Therm-a-Rest Ridge Rest Solar sleeping pad

We used a Go-Lite Down Fleece and REI Travel down sleeping bag

Both used trekking poles

I made a Super Cat stove to use for back country camping

No cotton clothes

Light weight hiking shoes (non water proof)

Head Lamp

Aquira Mira Drops

Food was Lipton side dish was chicken or tuna and cliff bars as breakfast


**Favorite places**

Colorado was no place like I've been before. The mountains were awesome and the driving was spectacular. The people were very friendly.

Montana was laid back and Glacier NP was amazing 

Utah was so different so it has to been on the list

People from Texas are freaking nice as hell



**Least favorite places from *OUR* perspective** 

Portland

Vancouver


**Crazy stories**

Both got arrested in Texas (Seriously

Had to scare off a 3 black bears from coming into our camping area in Yosemite

When we were backpacking in Glacier through a thick area a black bear stood up 5 feet in front of my us on the trail. It was scary as hell but we shouted and it ran off

In the mountains of Colorado we saw an 18 wheeler 3 cars in front of us making a tight turn then flip on its side. He was fine.



**Tips and tricks**

A smart phone is one of the best tools for a road trip. From finding routes, googleing stuff, finding cool spots to eat or cool bars that the locals hang out at. Plus reading reddit makes the long drives go faster. Didn't get cell service everywhere (Colorado, Montana, Utah).

Head lamp. Setting up a tent or doing anything at night while having your hands free is invaluable 

We stocked up on food and liquor before to cut costs which helped a lot

National Park Pass (America the Beautiful Pass) is only $80 for two people and you can go to any national park in a year. Without it we would have spent over $200 in total

If it's hot and you don't want to drink warm water soak a sock in water and put your water bottle in it. Hang it out the window. As the water vaporizes it will cool the contents of the water bottle. Just like the way we sweat to cool our bodies.



**How did you do?**

I opened up a separate savings account and used mint.com to track my goal for a road trip. I put $450 in it every month for a 9 months to come close to $4000. I didn't go out or eat out much. I used excel for my daily budget.

I quit my corporate job with 3 months advance notice.

We woke up one morning and left.


**What are we doing now?**

I wanted to switch careers from Insurance to IT. Still applying to jobs in the Tri-State area. Currently waiting tables.

1341148354.0,vvltc,My 20 very useful travel tips for backpacking across Europe,DonTago,401,79,157,"* 1.) When booking flights and hostels


* 2.) On that same note


* 3.) Get the hell out of big cities and see some countryside and wilderness.


* 4.) Consider the humble bus: often faster and cheaper


* 5.) Ask at train stations about the quickest way to get from point to point; you will be surprised sometimes how helpful train attendants can be.

* 6.) Check multiple Bureau d'Exchanges for best currecy rates

* 7.) *DO NOT* flush toilets while your train is stopped at a station; many trains flush directly onto the track

* 8.) I would recommend NOT to make eye contact with gypsies. 

* 9.) Don't be afraid to ignore someone you know is trying to scam you; forget politeness

* 10.) Sometimes

* 11.) Guide books can be great, it generally never fails

* 12.) Do not show/give your passport to a ""police officer"" unless they can take you to a real police station first

* 13.) On the note of passports

* 14.) On the note of Eastern Europe, this can save much hassel

* 15.) Do not assume you can check out of your hostel and pay by card (many only take cash)

* 16.) Do not feel you need to move on quickly from place to place; if you like somewhere *STAY*! Get to know it

* 17.) Make sure all your credit cards are not ALL stored in the same spot

* 18.) If roving information service agents in a train/bus areas help you find your train/bus or give info

* 19.) Learn to say ""thank you"" ""hello"" ""no"" ""yes"" and ""excuse me"" in the language of whichever country you are in; this can be extremely helpful

* 20.) On that same note, but just pronounce what you see. For instance, in Bulgarian, the word ""restaurant"" is ""ресторант"", which although looks different, is pronounced almost exactly the same.

BONUS EDIT: A few more points that kind commenters have reminded me of:

* 21.) Get a chip &amp; pin credit card if possible. Although few banks in the US offer them, cash may be your only option without a chip &amp; pin card.

* 22.) DO NOT forget these few simple items: pad-lock, ear-plugs, teeny bottle of detergent and small sewing kit

* 23.) If you do travel by bus, you will be fined.

* 24.) To echo frasier_crane's comment below, flee the scene. Scammers will use large amounts of children to either rob you personally or distract you.

* 25.) On that same not

* 26.) Be sure to research local tipping protocol. Some areas it is not needed

* 27.) In crowded tourist areas

* 28.) Also, prices can be cut in half on food or drinks

* 29.) Most importantly, not get stressed because you'll have to wait an hour for the next bus you just missed.",,False,self,t5_2qh41,1341164060.0,,

Hello /r/travel 

I am new to this Sub and quickly found a new home.  I enjoy reading stories of travel, Cruise line suggestions, tours, etc... pretty much anything.  I spoke with my Uncle tonight (He has 25 years in the business alone) and he seemed excited to share his knowledge on this confounded internet box.  Together, his top three agents have about 125 years of experience, and I'm sure they would be more than happy to share their knowledge with you. Heck, ask them about their worst client

Please let me know and i will make it happen

Thanks!

I just set up my boss with an account he will be posting as **CrownTravelCEO**

**Edit 1:  I have spoken to him

~~I will create a post about 5:30 PM Central  and link it in here.  Please direct your questions there for the quickest response

**We will answer all questions here throughout the day as well as we have access to reddit at work (that's right!)

We had never hitchhiked before in our lives, asked people and police where we could camp, got invited into their homes and stations quite often with wonderful hospitality. We also WWOOFed (in Mexico and Argentina), and used couchsurfing (we must've couchsurfed at least once almost every country we've been in).

And yes, and lodging. Since lodging is free, travel is free, we only had to worry about spending on food and miscellaneous stuff, and we ate cheap street food and never got sick. 

It should be said that we are both Deaf and do not speak one word between us (we sign with each other... and no, waiting for the right moment and inspiration to seize me into writing a book or something.

So ask me anything you might want to know about traveling in such a fashion or about the places.

Countries we hitchhiked: Mexico, El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Panama, Colombia, Peru, Uruguay. (we actually went north from Ushuaia to see the Iguazu Falls then returned to Buenos Aires to catch the flight back to the states.)

This is my first post here and I need help. I thought I had exhausted all my options

In the summer of 2007, a tourist bus from the company ""1st Alaska Outdoor School"", driven by a guy named Ralf Dobrovolny, passed us. As we reached the town, my brother and I fell in each other's arms next to the passengers of the bus.

Amongst the passengers, but I lost the paper when we cycled to Anchorage. It was August 27th, 2007 and we all went for a tour of the oilfield afterwards.

*   (1) Always make sure you have earplugs and face-mask for sleeping when in a noisy dorm room

*   (2) Sheets are often included in most hostels these days

*  (3) Many hostels do NOT allow alcohol. Make sure to check before you go on a beer/wine run

*  (4) Some hostels disallow you access into your room during certain times of the day for cleaning. This is not extremely common

*  (5) Many hostels do NOT provide towels with their linens. Make sure to bring your own just in case

*  (6) Many hostels

*  (7) AVOID leaving your passport as a deposit. Reception will often ask this in lieu of paying at check-in

*  (8) Keep in mind when making reservations at hostels (esp. online), no matter what. That is common policy.

*  (9) You commonly find hostels without lockers. While I have not had any problems myself, you will often need it for lockers]

*  (10) Always wear sandals in the shower at hostels. While traveling

*  (11) Just about all hostels have free WIFI these days

*  (12) Read reviews for hostels

*  (13) When trying to locate a hostel, you would never find them without specific instructions.

*  (14) Get to know the hostel owner/host. Hostel owners in areas tend to know each other

*  (15) In my experience

*  (16) Meet as many new people as you can!  Everyone at a hostel has 1 thing in common; they are travellers. Get to know them. When you get back home to your apartment

*  (17) DO NOT leave your shampoo in the shower. Shampoo is a hot commodity to the backpacker. If it is left around

*  (18) If you are leaving on an early train

*  (19) Watch for bedbugs! Read hostel reviews

*  (20) Make SURE not to leave your wallet in the pocket of your trousers laying next to your bed before you turn in for the night. If someone in the room DOES plan to steal from you

*  (21) Always pick a bottom bunk! They are easier to get in/out of

*  (22) As a hosteler, there is no concierge, no room-service, no mint on the pillows. You are a traveller, *not* a tourist. Life is an adventure. Do not throw a tantrum because there is no hot water. At a hostel, it happens!",,self,,

Education in many developing countries, when I see a tourist dropping their change to a child of school-going age *on a school day* it means only one thing - the child is getting less and less incentive to go to the school.

The same goes for children selling things. This is not so much a problem at corners or even that prevalent in Bangkok, you will be swamped at some landmark by kids selling souveniers. The only definite place I know of for this in Bangkok is kids pulling the ['release a bird' scam](http://www.thai-blogs.com/2007/04/11/tourist-scams-in-bangkok/) at the Grand Palace. In a situation like this, where there is tourist tat you might want, even if it's not a school day, I would encourage you to direct your custom to an adult. Even directly tell the adult why you are buying from them - kids shouldn't be working.

Giving to the needy in poorer areas can help a lot and is commendable; however,False,self,t5_2qh41,False,,mys,t3_q5cqa

* If you are booking a hotel room online, expedia etc. Find your dates and compare rates. But then, call the actual hotel reservation line and tell them. They will most likely match the rates you found and probably give you a better deal or free stuff. Reason? They sell wholesale to third party sites, so therefore can sell for less than what third party sites retail for and still make more money.

*  Hotels often jokingly refer to their crappier rooms as the ""expedia"" rooms. In other words

* The term ""Best Available Rate"" does not actually mean the lowest rate available. That's just what they call the standard rate. 

*  After being quoted a ""best available rate"", though. Joining the hotel's loyalty program (email list) will get you those codes.

* Some pro stuff tips: Try asking for a ""friends and family rate"". Just say you know someone at the hotel (if talking to a call center). They typically don't check that stuff. The FFR can be substantially cheaper. Alternatively

* NEVER book an Advanced Purchase Rate if you can help it. These are usually pre-paid, if this rate is available, typically there's always another promotion that's at least as cheap, that you don't have to pre-pay and that can be cancelled.

* If you book online, they just list inventories from databases, and they usually don't point out the difference. I get calls every day because of this. 

* Rates for the same room, they will do it no problem. Call back a few days beforehand for the same reason. Some people know this strategy and it works well for them.

* AAA discounts are actually pretty good,,False,self,t5_2qh41,False,,True

To add to that, Japan, maybe S Korea and Vietnam etc. 

Sooo... I have enough vacation time saved up that I can take about 2 weeks off next year

I'm scared of traveling alone though. Not that I'm worried about crime

What are your thoughts? Do you always (or even mostly) travel alone? Is it worth it? Do you have more or less fun? Is it better to plan out your trip completely so that you have a full day and come back home tired? Does it depend on the country and how outgoing you are?

I woke up feeling a little bit better, got lost, and found my way back to my hotel.  I ate at the Hard Rock (I know...) and got drunk with an older Australian gentleman.   I met a really nice Swedish girl at the next bar I went to with the Australian, but she left shortly after with her friends.  I was pretty drunk and having a great time, but I decided it would be best to go back to the hotel.

So today I wake up late with a pretty bad hangover.  I shower, but the language barrier really kicked my ass.  I have a bad stomach already, so I was feeling it ten-fold and didn't want to end up buying something that would make it worse.  I ended up buying a fruit smoothie from a street vendor and it helped, but now I'm really hungry again.  

I don't know what I'm expecting, what to eat, what train to get on, and the language barrier is getting to me.  I really want this to be the best time of my life, but I feel just like a scared dude in a strange land.

I do plan on hosteling but wanted to ease into it with a hotel for the first few nights.  I think part of the problem is that I don't have anything planned, and it just contributes to the lost feeling.

1349618338.0,11355s,"Can I have a quick word, /r/travel?",Number8,207,52,http://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/11355s/can_i_have_a_quick_word_rtravel/, sometimes my confidence in people and how they treat each other is questioned and causes me to question what I'm doing. While travelling, although not all. 

Last night a man died in town. I don't know his name or where he is from. I guess he had an alergic reaction to an insect bite, and I was not there, but one of my good friends that I've met travelling came upon this man on his own. Nobody was helping him as he lay there dying on the street, and this is not an uncommon reaction to such a situation. There were witnesses, but my friend was the one who had to wake up a local bar owner to try and get this man to the hospital. He managed to secure him a ride to the hospital on the back of a motorbike, but he died before he arrived. Today, that same friend was riding back to the farm where we stay and the chain snapped on his motorbike. He was lucky not to have been severely hurt, I most likely wouldn't have been so lucky. The point is he sat on the side of the road for two hours trying to wave people down to get help, and I find myself developing a resentment to those here who won't help a foreigner simply because he/she is Falang. I'm no stranger to racial prejudice

I guess what I'm trying to say is be careful while you're exploring this world. Self-preservation is of the utmost importance. You cannot rely on the benvolence of others to ensure your own safety. There are good people and there are bad people everywhere, and travel respectfully. Don't be the reason cultural divisions are augmented. Think about your actions before you act, because while you may be moving on shortly, the impressions that you leave behind will affect the next traveller who comes and takes your place.
