I still don't want hirez to monitor my programs and what I do

*Hello everyone, I recently joined the mod team on this Subreddit. In cooperation with the other staff on this Subreddit, we've laid out plans for the near future, so here they are. 't would be awesome if you could click the little arrow pointing upwards to the left, so we can make sure everyone on the Reddit sees this post. I'm not taking any karma for it anyways. Now, back on topic. We have news to discuss!*

As /r/Smite has started to grow more rapidly over the past few weeks, we have to change certain elements. A brief list of what is going to happen over the coming weeks:

* Rules and Protocol: the main point. There will be a much more detailed rule system coming up, we are going to try to cover up all grey areas in between what is allowed and what is not. We will not be inhibiting your current constructive posting habits however.

* FAQ: a Frequently Asked Questions section will be made

* New Subreddit layout: getting rid of the outdated theme that is currently in use. 

Other Sidebar improvements

* Improved Match of the Day information. Not just the official description

* Links to Patch Notes threads
Condensing the sidebar and using the wiki to help clean it up. (ex: There will be a “Community Fansites” link that goes to the wiki and lists all the fansites. It helps condense the sidebar and keep it clean).

* “Official” discussion threads: Threads made by moderators and used as the official place to discuss new gods, and gamemodes. Will be done mostly per patch, unless the patch is big enough to be split up in two or even three different threads. This will allow us to declutter the subreddit and allow HiRez one central place to view feedback on Reddit.

* Wiki Improvements: In its current state, and slowly work our way to adding links to guides and more extensive descriptions of each God and/or commonly used terms in Smite (e.g. CC, GF, etc.).
* Flair Cleanup: The way flair will be distributed is going to be changed.
- Free for all God flair (White
- /r/Smite Moderator flair (green) is
- HiRez Studios flair (orange) will only be available for HiRez representatives and will not be accesible for normal member  (it used to be possible to actually use the flair logo
- Top Tier Gaming Team flair (White, please send us a mod mail. 

So, altough it might be subject to change. We'll give everyone a heads up if there are any major changes. This is more aimed at the extra flairs that have caused some confusion and hurt feelings over the past few weeks, such as the gaming team flairs. 

If you have any feedback please feel free to leave it in this thread and we’ll read every post and take it into consideration as a moderator team. And if you would like to help with the Wiki or the FAQ, etc. for pasting long bits of text, not the PM itself). Credit will be given.

A team to me is more then business, it's just how things go.

I will still be around in the competitive scene and still stream on SMITEPRO and see where it takes me. I'm sorry for letting my team down and my fans and other competitive players in the scene. I can be a real douche sometimes. I just wear my feelings on my sleeve, bad manners or chicken.

It's a big reality check and I hope you guys stick with me through my bumpy road. I just brought so much real life stress into the game and it's not gonna happen again.

The support player should receive ELO per assist and major objective HoGd (ie GF, which is mainly seen in assists through good CC/positioning. HoGging objectives is another way that supports can really sway a game into their teams favor, which is why I feel it should also be rewarded. I personally have had several games where I've stolen FGs and GFs for my team and it's something that should be rewarded. Rewarding good habits is how a player learns, since they are more inclined to perform proper actions if rewarded accordingly for them. Suggested numbers for ELO gains would be 1 ELO per assist (or make it equal to a kill) and 3 ELO per major objective HoGd. *Assist and HoG benefits should only be given to Support/Tank specific Gods.

An example of how poorly the ELO system works right now for supports/tanks: https://account.hirezstudios.com/smitegame/match-details.aspx?match=14868505. A 57 minute game in which I HoGd many objectives and received 33 assists and yet only gained 11 ELO. SMH!

If there is anything that I would like Hirez to do for me it would be this. Please Hirez

*God Icon: http://i.imgur.com/85y3juY.jpg*

**Unknown [P]** - From icon looks to be some type of minion mechanic. (Icon: http://i.imgur.com/XLKqYOB.jpg)

**Scroll [1]** - Creates entity in the game world. Most likely Zhong Kui's hand and marks a select target for 4 seconds. (Icon: http://i.imgur.com/e3vejJN.jpg)

**Fierce Glare [2]** - Deployable in the world. Has a delayed heal attached to it and interacts directly with Bag of Demons. (Icon: http://i.imgur.com/OF7e7R7.jpg)

**Exorcism [3]** - Charged up damage ability with countdown mechanic on use. (Icon: http://i.imgur.com/NQANT14.png)

**Bag of Demons / Recall Demons [4]** - Interacts differently with friendly and enemy gods. Has a two step on use effect and can also interact differently with the marked target from Scroll. Has some type of stacking mechanic which may be linked to Fierce Glare. (Icon: http://i.imgur.com/zhnMjYq.jpg)


##Guan Yu V2

**Fortified Defense (?) [P]** - Passive gains stacks and acts as a healing multiplier (with a max cap on stacks) for Tranquil Gift.

**Tranquil Gift [1]** - Works similar to the live version. Hitting friendly gods with your heal will reduce your other cooldowns.

**Warrior's Will [2]** - Works similar to live except that it records how many enemy gods you hit and has a mechanic that plays off of the max number hit.

**Unknown [3]** - Taolu Assault is still missing from Guan Yu's kit. Instead his third ability in version 2 is titled ""TripleJumpSlam"" which leads me to believe a toned down version of his current ultimate will replace Taolu Assault as his new 3.

**Gallop [4]** - Rides a warhorse (we know this already). Ultimate will have 3 phases each ramping up with increased speeds (P1 - 1x


## New Gamemode / Map

There are several mentions of a new Capture and Hold (single control point) map in the game files. It is mostly prefixed with ""Norse_"". Instances of 10v10 Joust

##VIP Status

The VIP status icon has been added to the new interface's files. It would be safe to assume since these are new files for the new UI and the VIP icon is present that it more than likely has an intended use in the near future.

##PVE and VS Modes

Loads of new icons appear in the new interface files. All of them are prefixed with ""PVE_"" or ""VS_"" and depict various images such as swords

##EDIT: Olympus Map Replacement for Conquest

Found a fair amount of new map assets for Olympus. All focusing around the current objectives for Conquest. Here's a gated entry way to the minotaur's arena: http://i.imgur.com/13mqTOK.jpg

##No Upcoming God

Jumong is the only unreleased god besides Zhong Kui to appear in the game files. Jumong has been in the game files for months now, Hel, and Sun Wukong, granting graphical updates to nearly their entire lineup of gods, and restructuring most of the game for launch. From what I can piece together from the files I would expect a **MAJOR announcement at Gamescon** concerning the future of Smite and major changes.

– Listen to audiobooks. While they are expensive to buy and lengthy to illegally download

– Perform basic hygiene tasks. Do your nails need trimming? Forgot to brush your teeth this morning? All of these things and more can be easily accomplished if you just play your lane extremely passively

– Do sit-ups. Motivation for physical activity can easily be found from the hatred that taunt-spamming smurfs inspire. 

– Prepare food. Another way to cope with loss.

– Watch streams of people playing junglers. They look like they're having a good time.

&gt;

I do not presume to know why you like SMITE as much as or more than any other game on the market. I can guess that it might be the notable perspective difference for an ever-expanding game genre. It could be the observance of various mythologies that expands with every update to the character roster. Or maybe it is the social aspect of gaming with friends and participating in live streams. No matter what your reason for enjoying Smite

&gt;

What is the **one thing**? Have I lost you yet? I sincerely hope you have stuck with me to this point. It is imperative that you grasp the point of this post

&gt;

From new players creating an account at the booth to people with eFame that makes Bart cry himself to sleep

&gt;

Although [The Creatures](https://www.youtube.com/user/thecreaturehub) experienced a new level of stardom with the success of their first ever panel discussion, it is because they not only want to see us grow, they *expect* us to grow.

&gt;

And then there is the legendary [SirScoots](http://www.teamliquid.net/forum/viewmessage.php?topic_id=236041). While he may not have gotten in line for [Bart's kissing booth](http://imgur.com/a/C2TrG) just yet

&gt;

My point is not to name drop and image bomb in this post. I just want you all to realize that people are noticing this game that you enjoy. They sincerely identify with many of the same reasons you enjoy it. And they genuinely expect it to grow and succeed. Keep that in mind the next time someone asks you, ""I play SMITE. And you know what? You should too!""

1368350508.0,1e6d2l,For all the DRAMA,Psiyo,124,22,65,"For everyone who is whining about ROOT wins everything (on NA) ... in league of legends the team TSM haven't lost a single event from NA in Season 2.... this was a year of domination from 1 Team yet still look at their scene.


I think most of the people here are either people that cannot make it due to time problems or lacking in a team into the competetive scene so they try to make it worse than it actualy is.


And people that just dislike the competetive scene or the game for whatever reason.... because when you count 1+1 together that we have already a EU scene with about 22 teams that want to play there every week in a game that is fairly unknown to anyone still is a good thing.


People always expect too much because they have a standart from LoL or DOTA but this is not the case in SMITE.. SMITE is completely different not jsut that its 3rd person and hard to spectate also like people said ""PRO"" players are not innovative enough with lets say the 2-1-2 lane setup.... believe me we try to find the best META at any given time and right now it is the 2-1-2 .. jsut as an example!


Also the competition in EU is very tight SK/ViCs/BLGEU/and elemon now with badgah and youngbae playing there anyone of these called teams have the same chances to win this tournament ( i don't want to say that other teams don't but this is how i se it right now)

Also yes CW disbanded and i'am really sad about that but this is how it goes and if they lost the joy to play the game that's jsut how it will come down....


Also to pick on hirez a bit now yess i know that people saying stuff doesn't get paid out but as it goes for me and my Team we never had any problems whatsoever with getting paid out i don't know if this was a one time thingy or whatsoever but as for us we never had any problems with that!


Next up people complaining about ""PRO"" players don't play smite that much... that has probably something to do with the players itself not soo much the game (also the game a bit ) because for my part iam playing and streaming the game about 10 hours every day to get better and better and i know for myself that i'm far away from being at my own best that i could be mechanically or overall mobawise so i will play and practice till i reach this goal for me and my TEAM!



On the other hand the NA scene they also have SNIPE/ROOT/CURSE right now that are top the only thing is that ROOT just shines out right now because they really have every driving memeber from the older teams (RG/CURSE) so obviously the other teams get weaker if the core member is leaving and root will get stronger probably!


And all the whining about the scene is bad or the community is not there where you guys want it to be because of this and that but that is not the case because of this and that .... that is the case because of us all !
You guys want to the scene to be good and friendly and fair but yet still you pick and post and whine about every small misstep someone makes or has done in the past... and yet still people complain and complain and don't do anything about it to change it!

GUYS it is up to us the community to make this a better place not anyone else so if everyone of you guys just ask yourself what they want for this community and do whatever they can do make it happen it will get a better place sooner or later... but always complaining and hoping someone else will fix it won't fix anything...


I have to say and admit yes the scene is from time to time bad with admins doing stupid stuff or whatever there is but you have to say that everyone even the casters are new to the whole thing more or less so it is still a learning experience for both the players and the community casters admins ect to behave the right way and to do stuff the right way... hell even for hirez they need to see what they can do when they can do it and how it works out...



So after everything being said what i have to say hopefuly i haven't offended anyone i just said what i had to say after all the drama (which is not that much people tend to make it more than it actualy is) happening!

(ALSO MY GRAMMER and my wall of text is op don't blame me i just write down everything i have to say i don't wanna sell it as a book!)

What I'm asking for isn't anything incredibly difficult as other MOBAs (I'm looking at you DotA 2) have executed most of this before.
 A lot of the things that I'm bringing up have also been complained about before
Please feel free to comment with your opinions on this and what else needs to be added to this list.

* The toxic community in both casual and ranked matchmaking.

I know you're thinking that this can't be solved and I agree with you on that, but encourage them to be nice. The report system has been largely the same since the launch of the Smite Beta and, let's be honest here, do any of us really see it to be working well in its current state? We still get toxic players in almost every match we play. Something really needs to change whether it's more severe and accurate reporting, telling us when a player we reported has action taken upon them (like in DotA 2), the implementation of a commendation system, or something similar.

* Matchmaking.

Casual: ""dn't wnt 2 play wit us bad plyers go play rnked""
Ranked: ""OMG YOU PICKED HERCULES INSTEAD OF THOR REPORTED UNINSTALL""
Yeah, but these are two extremes right now. I would like a shot at winning without everybody insta-locking assassins and then not talking until they die from an uncalled missing, but I would also like to play some Gods that aren't in the Ranked Meta without being flamed for it. Games should be fun and Smite is when you get two balanced teams, but that virtually never happens. I constantly get matched up with level 18 players just learning not to buy Meditation on every God flaming everybody else for their mistakes. I'm not going to go into what needs to be changed with Ranked because I sort of have already. With a better report system, we'll see less people going in and flaming and/or trolling. The ""Trueskill"" system obviously isn't working at the moment, and I (and most people) would totally be fine with increased queue times if it meant we got  more balanced match. Hell, I'd even settle for something that isn't a timed queue even though I have a strong sexual attraction to them.

* God Balance.

Everybody knows about this one. Power creep has become a huge part of Smite. While this isn't terrible, and I do agree with this to an extent, but all or at least most Gods should have their place with counter picking or situational picks. In DotA 2 (Yes, I'm going to compare this game to DotA 2 a lot, get used to it. It's a fantastic game.) Heroes hop in and out of the meta, but it doesn't really have that much to do with balance patches. It only takes someone picking them up and doing well with them for others to follow along behind them, so the meta is changing very often, we need to have a ton of God variation in this game and those Gods actually having a chance at an equal bracket against the other Gods.

* Item quantity and balance.

Currently in Smite, the best. In DotA 2, this isn't the case. Literally all items on all Heroes are situational, there aren't any items that simple calculations can refute as being worse than others, there's an incredibly high amount of variation. In Smite, we have around 5 items for each purpose with some passive abilities that benefit the user, but generally there's one that's just better than all of the others. We're never like ""Oh, let's get this magical defense item or attack item instead of this one"". It just doesn't happen when it probably should. We need more situational items and general item balance.

* Region Locking.

I was going to put this under matchmaking, and lock it in. With a game that requires so much precision to succeed, I can't believe that we don't have this anymore. I've gotten matched up with either EU players on my team or on the enemy team, and either them or I are getting the short end of the stick with the latency issue. 200 ping vs 50 ping makes an incredibly large difference as you all know and a game can be lost right from the start if you're playing someone that requires precision and you have terrible ping.

* Random weird small issues.

There are too many to really record and write down
No ability to sell back actives after a misclick
Various UI glitches and overall a very underwhelming system. I feel like HP5 should either mean health every 5 seconds all at once or just constantly being shown refreshing every .1 seconds or so.
I'm sure you guys can think of more of these little things. They aren't a big deal

* ~~Private~~ Public Test Servers. 

We used to have this magical place where things were tested before release to avoid game breaking bugs and crazy unbalance. This place has vanished
(Edit: Fixed point subtitle

* Disclaimer

These are just things off the top of my head. Like I said earlier, I'll edit with the point.
I also want to make it clear that I'm not saying that I don't think these things won't be in the game

I would also love it if you guys didn't just vote either up or down but also gave either a positive or negative comment based on your opinions. Thanks!

&lt;@hirezerez&gt; support are fine with the elo rating

&lt;@hirezerez&gt; DId you guys know that the frame for Level 10 mastery looks a bit different then normal gold frame?

&lt;@hirezerez&gt; The icons on the left also glow

&lt;@hirezerez&gt; They are for prestige

&lt;@hirezerez&gt; next patch is a lot of new tier 3 items

&lt;@hirezerez&gt; that's next week

&lt;@hirezerez&gt; week after that is another new god

&lt;@hirezerez&gt; Hel remodel is moving forward

&lt;@hirezerez&gt; blue beams is a nice idea

&lt;@hirezerez&gt; new model and some changes to her abilities

&lt;xxxxxxx&gt; Erez

&lt;@hirezerez&gt; I think the hotfix is tonight

&lt;@hirezerez&gt; 70+ people working on Smite now

&lt;@hirezerez&gt; Smite started with about 15-20 people

&lt;@hirezerez&gt; It was actually started as another GA game mode that I was designing before I knew there was something called a 'MOBA'

&lt;@hirezerez&gt; We had 2 bases

&lt;@hirezerez&gt; Smite will be getting a lot more servers around the world over the next few months

&lt;xxxxxxx&gt; Erez any hints on who the next god will be?

&lt;@hirezerez&gt; Support god

&lt;@hirezerez&gt; I don't know where the servers will be based

&lt;@hirezerez&gt; I don't really have a favorite god

&lt;@hirezerez&gt; One of the first games I made was for the Atari 2600

&lt;@hirezerez&gt; Actually is was a 'kind' of lunar lander but not the original

&lt;@hirezerez&gt; I wrote games in Assembly 6502 before going to college

&lt;@hirezerez&gt; My first program was on a punch cards computer

&lt;xxxxxx&gt; Erez I liked neiths old bow better :(

&lt;@hirezerez&gt; I have no idea why we changed her bow

&lt;xxxxxx&gt; Erez Will we ever be able to buy the skins like ra alienware and kali red one? I'll be super sad if I miss out on those

&lt;@hirezerez&gt; No idea if we will sell those skins

&lt;@hirezerez&gt; I really want to stay away from a pure single meta like LoL

&lt;@hirezerez&gt; when you get hit there is a red out line we are testing

&lt;@hirezerez&gt; RTS games have multiple meta

&lt;@hirezerez&gt; 2-1-2 was just getting too boring to play and watch

&lt;@hirezerez&gt; 2-1-2 should be a valid option

&lt;@hirezerez&gt; All magic Gods will move to magic in-hand soon and more items to support them

&lt;xxxxxx&gt; what language is smite written in and what DB are y'all using on the back end (curious because i'm a dev myself)

&lt;@hirezerez&gt; Unreal 3 engine and C code

&lt;@hirezerez&gt; you will be able to play something like an AD ra but with magic damage

&lt;@hirezerez&gt; no crit for mages

&lt;@hirezerez&gt; I think there will be a god with a jetpack at some point

&lt;@hirezerez&gt; as a skin

&lt;@hirezerez&gt; I think we talked about a jetpack apollo

&lt;@hirezerez&gt; Smite is really the only game we are focused on now

&lt;@hirezerez&gt; GA2 when we have time

&lt;@hirezerez&gt; We put a lot of work into Tribes but we can only take it so far.   99% of games decline in users (Including Tribes) but Smite is one of the few games to actually be growing (very rare)

&lt;@hirezerez&gt; Voice chat is just another way to troll

&lt;@hirezerez&gt; There is not going to be all chat

&lt;@hirezerez&gt; There are a lot of voice chat options available already

&lt;@hirezerez&gt; Domination is getting a big change

&lt;@hirezerez&gt; We are about to start testing it

&lt;@hirezerez&gt; The theme is staying the same

&lt;xxxxxxx&gt; Erez

&lt;@hirezerez&gt; We actually tried that a few months ago

&lt;@hirezerez&gt; Next path will let you refresh the buff you have if you get the same one 

&lt;@hirezerez&gt; No drops of buff

&lt;@hirezkabir&gt; what Chronos 2 gllitch?

&lt;@hirezkabir&gt; Chronos accelerates over time then decelerates

&lt;@hirezkabir&gt; where gonna put in som ebetter feed back for that soon

&lt;@hirezkabir&gt; i'm 100% it works

&lt;@hirezkabir&gt; not sure the exact timeat full

&lt;@hirezerez&gt; The jungle buff stacking makes one player happy and 4 players pissed

&lt;@hirezerez&gt; Smite always gets optimization changes

&lt;@hirezerez&gt; FG does not count as a jungle buff

&lt;@hirezerez&gt; I don't really know the timing on skins and voice packs since I focus a lot more on the design

&lt;@hirezerez&gt; assault will get a new graphics pass after conquest is done

&lt;@hirezerez&gt; I'm slightly above average elo unless I try really hard

&lt;@hirezerez&gt; I never cheat

&lt;@hirezerez&gt; The conquest map graphics are getting a huge overhaul

&lt;xxxxxxx&gt; do I need to write something in that field or blank is just enough to report a troll?

&lt;@hirezerez&gt; better if you write something

&lt;@hirezkabir&gt; we're looking into why some players are unable to load into new Joust

HiRezTodd:
Sun WuKong will be getting an entirely new treatment in a future update. 
He will have different abilities, &amp; visual fx. 
Our goal

At the same time we know some players enjoy the current monkey-god and playstyle. 
With the next release we will transform the current Sun WuKong into the Mayan monkey god Hun-Batz. Compared to current Sun WuKong, but very similar abilities. And Shoalin Monkey skin will remain usable on new Hun-Batz.

Additional details to be provided on smitegame twitch stream starting next week.

As many of you will know, there has never been a full-time jungle role in Smite, despite many of these gods (Arachne) being available from the very beginning. The reason why jungling isn't viable has never been a case of bad gods or bad items; it's because of the jungle layout itself.

In current sidelane meta, you will not be able to take their camps without assistance.

In addition to this, gold and buffs available to them from these said buff camps. If you factor in that the enemies of that lane will be taking their own buffs, you'll realise that you're actually causing one of your sidelanes to get behind their opponents due to your desire to jungle. The end result of this is that you have a one side lane that is behind their opponents due to lack of jungle creeps, another side lane that has been sitting under his tower in a best case scenario, getting zoned or feeding in a worst case scenario, and a jungler who, yes, but is still behind on experience because of the FACT that there is not enough experience available in the jungle to make up for the experience you're missing in lane.

So please, and you're just going to screw over your team.

He played really well, overextending etc. So I kept on complimenting him and he did the same with me, which was really nice! After the match he added me and told me Smite was his favourite game right now (because of that match) and that he actually really loved it, so he asked me how he could get favor fast, I told him he just needed to play conquest, but after two more matches where he had rented Agni, he said he couldn't wait to buy him with favor. Then I thought ""why wait?"" then I told him I was gonna get him a present, man was he in heaven he was so happy he barely could accept them!

There has been a ton of complaints about the current state of the jungle and they are already looking to make a change.  New gods come out as do new items to constantly change the game. They have updated the map several times, and with that what people want out of the game is changing and all in all Hi-Rez is trying to keep up with demands.

1370691240.0,1fx6yz,Let's talk about Xbalanque,Kobrokai,98,16,59,"In this post, particularly when compared to other gods.

The  point I wish to bring up I believe is a bug rather than a design choice, and he did state that it was intended, however I'm not sure he understood what I was saying. 

So, Xbalanque is the ONLY god in the game who can have his instant cast abilities interrupted AND lose the cooldown. Essentially, with both Xbalanque's 2nd and 3rd skills, he can be interrupted while casting, thus not technically activating his ability (no projectiles or damage), however the cooldown is still taken. 

This is best illustrated by the following video created by Fest and Safari: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh6c1sa9P0E

Now, the most obvious that comes to mind is Wukong's Overhead Smash. That skill has a massive wind up time, and it's very easy to tell when to interrupt. However, if Wukong is interrupted, he never loses the cooldown. This is consistent across all gods with wind up animations; all of them except Xbalanque. Is this fair? Is this necessary? Personally, I think not, Xbalanque already has a ton of problems (easy to avoid ultimate, which occurs far too frequently and is easy to exploit

The same issue also lies with Xbalanque's Rising Jaguar, which are CC immune, yet Xbalanque's is vital, and easily interrupted before any damage or mobility can be gained. As players, what do you guys feel? Do you think it's necessary that Xbalanque can have his core skill interrupted to easily without any beneficial effects whatsoever? Should the damage be guaranteed? Should he have CC immunity?

I personally feel like the item was a really good idea but I honestly don't think its fitting into the Smite that I (and others I know) love.

The mask has resulted in there being 2 lanes where its 2v1 during all laning phase. This has resulted in laning phase being the most boring aspect of the game and now the first 10 minutes of the game is absolutely boring and you just wait for a 3v1 or 2v2 situation on lanes where you have the advantage due to element of surprise.

Additionally there is no structure anymore since you can't call the guy missing. Sure you will be able to ward but the opponent team is able to ward aswell so you will almost never know where the junglers is. Additionally I see in a lot of matches people grouping up after 5 minutes since the laning phase has been completely neutralized anyways.

In short I think this item is really bad for smite and the fast gameplay I loved about Smite is gone and all you do now is PvE without even trying to PvP until you reach the 15 minute mark or so.

1376735192.0,1kjlgc,Have Hi Rez caused themselves a problem with god design going forward?,neil1000,96,18,188,"Hi all

I just wanted to start a discussion about god kits and problems going forward. At the moment when you watch a tourny the god selection is very predictable indeed.

Lets look at a few regular picks;


Anhur - ADC, a stun, a leap, cc immunity on his ult.

Apollo - Has a dash

Athena - Has a dash

Sobek, some disruption and cc immunity in ult.

Thor - A stun, an ult that can initiate/escape.


The main concern I have is that in order to see different gods in high end play they have to have comparable kits or they won't be picked.

Hi Rez simply can't release gods with similar kits to Artemis/Anubis (perfectly designed gods imo) as they will be bottom of the pack and never picked.

So what Hi Rez has to do is release abominations like Tyr, a heal all along with huge dps. He will be first pick first ban mark my words.

The only way Hi Rez can introduce more gods into the competitive scene is to bloat their kits. People are already complaining about mobility/cc but surely the only path Hi Rez can take is to add more mobility and CC

Is anyone else a bit worried? I don't see too many options for god design going forward at the moment

Have a maze map with walls you cannot see through or past unless you are using flying ultimates... you can still blink or jump past walls as well.
A minotaur spawns in the map and roams around, jumps or gain additional movement speed from items or god abilities.

Objective:
The first team to reach 20 kills on the enemy team wins. Minotaur killing a person gives the other team a kill point towards their goal to get 20 kills.

Simple objective

Wards

This game mode has no minions or towers and no gold fury or firegiant just an intricate maze with paths both wide and narrow to provide various traps or strategies. Smart teams will use the minotaur to their advantage to keep the enemy closer to him as the minotaur will have no allegiance to any team and will kill whatever is closest to him. Discuss

Another suggested idea for the name: The Labyrinth.

EDIT: Other points that have been brought up in comments below are:

Random select god

Certainly the Minotaur would have his own weaknesses so hes optimal and not overpowered... I said slowing down around the corner

Maps could varry

I would say the Minotaur to start in the middle of the map... players start on the side much like in Domination

Now that Hi-Rez is going to let social media platforms handle their player and moderator interaction this topic needs to be brought up again.

There is absolutely no argument that can be given against giving players the options to select if they want to region lock the servers they play on. I am not saying force NA and EU players to only play on their own servers but to give players the ability to pick that option if they want to.

I live on the west coast and server pings are already bad enough. I know the NA servers are on the east coast but compared to other games I can get better pings on east coast servers in those games then I do in Smite.

When I get stuck on an EU server it becomes almost impossible to play effectively. I have no way of knowing what server I am going to be on until after I pick a god and trying to play a god who relies on skill shots becomes an exercise in futility when on an EU server.

The servers in general also have horrible lag compensation as it is. I don't know if they are simply no powerful enough to handle all the traffic but at no time should I see my spell animation

I have the CPU and GPU power to run Smite 5 times over so it's not an issue on my end and it's not my ISP either with speeds of 50Mbps down and 10Mbps up. I've tested my internet numerous times with excellent speed results

You obviously need more servers and more powerful servers in general but at the very least give us the ability to region lock so we can avoid servers outside our regional area.

1375932154.0,1jxkn7,Let's talk Anubis... From a High Ranking Masochist with Rank 10,ScythemanCT,85,13,59,"(Warning: Wall of Text Inc)

So as the title states I am a player currently in the top 100 of the leaderboards, and with all the talk of reworks lately, I've decided that a post is in order. So tonight, I'm going to lay out not only why i believe Anubis to be in need of change, but ways that I believe he could be changed for the better.

With that said, his primary (and truthfully only) job as a character is to CC and demolish a single carry with damage beyond comparison. The problem here is that ultimately he is lackluster in both roles. While his damage is high, it is ultimately unreliable due to an increasing amount of counters to CC and the ability to sidestep most of his damage by simply alternating A and D keystrokes. Conversely, he doesn't bring nearly as much team utility or safety than most other mages currently in the game. These factors ultimately lead to a character that can pubstomp and take advantage mistakes or miscalculations, but is quite easy to shut down. So the question becomes how to we address this issue while maintaining the intended playstyle of the character? Well let's start from the top.

Sorrow (passive): All of Anubis' abilities steal physical and magical protection (7 per tick) from the target. In addition

Now this ability really is the bread and butter Anubis. It provides him a fair amount of defensive stats while also weakening any enemies hit. This is what makes Anubis damage so scary

Plague of Locusts: A plague of locusts bellows forth from Anubis' mouth

The description I've put here lacks some important information so I'm going to describe a bit more about the skill. The range is quite small (about 30 meters if memory serves) but it has a very wide arcing area. It also does an absurd amount of damage (enough to clear archers at level 1 with standard items) and scales really well per tick (40% i think). The thing that makes this skill problematic is the fact that it makes you stationary, nor would it be fun or satisfying. This is the only skill that I think needs a full retooling to make a more fluid character. For an example, I present these changes. 

Plague of Locust: Anubis sends out a swarm of locust, the affliction spreads to any unaffected enemies within 20 feet. Enemies can only be afflicted once per cast. Range remains the same, arc is tightened (to be more like Water Cannon). Base damage and scaling remain the same, cooldown perhaps adjusted.

So let's look at what this does. First of all it solves the major problem of a stationary channel that makes him nothing more than a target, making him scarier to simply engage on. Now, I can't simply make the skill better without taking away, seeing as the original was balanced yet fundamentally flawed. The first con here is that I removed 33% of the damage from the skill, which in reality could still not be enough. I've also shrunken the AoE, but kept the low range, in order to preserve the sense of danger while making the skill slightly harder to hit. I'd also like to mention the idea of a short cast animation, without adding the traditional derpy speedboost/steroid/get-out-of-jail-free-card. Ultimately forcing you to be aware but allowing you to be scary to engage on

Mummify: Anubis fires a bandage projectile

A simple yet satisfying skillshot, and altering that basic idea could possibly ruin all fun in the character. So instead I choose to add a bit to the skill text that adds depth and makes even scarier to engage on too hard. 

Anubis fires a bandage projectile

Now i know you guys will probably think I'm crazy but hear me out. The biggest thing people complain about with Anubis is a lack of escape. However, meaning that you would have already had to done some form of damage. Now, with the previous change to Locust I made it possible to do damage reliably on the retreat, and grasping hands can already be used both offensive and defensively, so this change is targeted to make people thing about their approach on Anubis. The reward being an obvious swing in survivability, as well as the impending threat of another wrap. Of course, none of this matters if you miss. Alternately, that is.

Grasping Hands...
To be honest

Death Gaze: Anubis focuses all of his energy into a piercing gaze

Now, it allows for more adjustments made with less damage gaps to take advantage of. Obviously between his passive and other changes made the overall damage of Death Gaze would have to come down for balance sake, but to be able to hit more reliably it's worth it.

So that's what I have for you. For anyone who read through it all thank you for your time

TLDR: Anubis bad please change.

EDIT: I'd like to thank everyone for taking the time to read and post responses. At some point I'd like to see some Hirez faces chime in as well but that's wishful thinking.

1365158593.0,1bq4te,Advice on how to lose a lane without feeding,fabric9,83,13,23,"**1. INTRODUCTION**

I feel like this is something that a lot of people fail at. Even me, and thought I'd write down some conclusions I came to, and maybe people will appreciate it. There are a lot of parallels to draw here with other MOBA's, such as League, so a lot of this will be ""common sense"" to a lot of you.

Assume that you give up first blood, bad decisions, whatever. **ASSUME** that it happened. How do you deal with it from that point onwards, without dying every time you come back to lane? That's what this document is meant to address. It's mostly aimed towards side lanes, as they snowball a lot easier than midlane, and midlane is typically a lot easier to play defensive in.

**2. STAGE FIVE OF LOSING: ACCEPTANCE**

Jumping past a few stages of grieving, if at the end of the day you're able to win the game anyway.

The first step is to accept that you can't fight the enemy straight up in a fair fight. They are ahead of you in gold and experience. They can take fights in bad situations and still win. They can fight in minion disadvantage, or ahead.

Play defensively. Don't let them catch you in a fight, as the CC advantages may lie heavily in the favor of the opponents, and in those cases you should simply not be in lane any longer when the enemies are there. Which brings us to...

**3. KNOW YOURSELF AND KNOW YOUR ENEMY**

In the immortal words of Sun Tzu, if you know precisely what the enemy can do to you, and how you can counter it, you will survive every time.

Look at their items and abilities whenever they come back to lane. Realize that Ymir built Boots of Celerity and got a Heavenly Agility *before* he sprints at you with them and forces a fight that you could've avoided. Get abilities to counter their hard engages when possible. For example

If Bacchus stun is a threat to you, how they'll use them to force a fight, and how you can use yours to counter it.

**4. WARDS AND VISION**

I see this all the time in games. Lets say you're losing a lane so hard that the only thing stopping them from killing you over and over is that Tier 1 tower at your back. They push the lane, and then you push it right back to their tower. They return to the lane through your jungle, and force a fight on you. You die.

Another alternative I see often, allow their opposition to roam freely (unwarded), and they end up ganking both other lanes, snowballing the whole *game* instead of just their lane. I've even seen them try to counter-roam, which just ends up poorly (the opponents bring more to the gank than they do to the counter-gank, as we've already established their opposition is *ahead* of them).

The trick here is to know when to push and when not to. If all they're doing is dipping into the jungle to take a buff and coming back, let them push, and then take the safe exp/gold you can get. As soon as you see them roaming for a gank, however - push, and push hard. You need to get the tower if they end up ganking another lane, to make it an even trade.

The *only* way to make these calls safely is to use wards to gain vision. You may have to counter-ward actively to accomplish this as well. As long as you are able to keep your opponents from leaving the lane, which is the important thing.

**5. TOWER DIVE. WE MUST TOWER DIVE.**

When it gets to the point that they're eagerly waiting to tower dive you, just give up the tower. You can't survive a 2v3 tower dive when you're behind. Give up the tower, let mid push their lane, and defend at the T2 tower instead. One T1 tower is not the end of the world, and it won't set your team far enough behind to snowball the enemy team to victory.

If on the other hand they get two kills and *then* get the tower

Second

If your teammates aren't willing to help you, etc - but if they can't help, there's nothing for it. Give up the tower as lost, and let them know beforehand. Hopefully you have ward coverage to protect mid, who will now be extremely open for ganks from your lane, as you'll have a much harder time to keep pressure on your lane opposition.

**6. SUMMARY**

I hope this helps a few of you guys out there who are new to the game and find themselves feeding their lanes way too often, let me know! I'll try to squeeze it in somewhere in this wall of text... :)",[TIPS &amp; TRICKS],False,,t5_2stl8,1365170832.0,athena,

The problem with Bumba's is that it promotes new roles that I don't enjoy



Because of the terrible matchmaking system i'm always chucked in with semi premades. Usually two two man teams or a four man team. This happens in 50% of my games.



As soon as this happens i'm told to mid. I have no choice. Now I used to enjoy mid



Actually to clarify what is boring in my opinion;



Solo lane is BORING



Two man lane zoning out the solo laner is BORING



Mid is BORING (due to jungler threat)

Now you have introduced a total PvE meta in which one player is virtually guaranteed to become a machine of death unless the opposing team has the cohesion to counter it.  Which simply doesn't happen very often in public matches where the players don't typically share voice communication.  And to top it all off you've also forced an individual to play a lane solo

https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1lWzt3d65_rM9znklSpXVPnZYxdK9zkXrlfDyBg0D5wY/viewform

There are a few other things to discuss. 

Flair: With the new theme, and team flair. Team flair is given to the teams that consistenly place top 3 in either of the tournaments. I believe we are missing Snipe, but that is about it. (If we are missing another let me know).This is to keep the flair from getting cluttered like it was before. 

Rule Changes: We may still be adding rules, it may be subject to removal. We now have /r/gank for memes and /r/smitelfm for ""LFM"" (looking for more) posts. If you post either of those, it will be removed and we will tell you to post it on one of those. Some of the new rules include: No bug posts, no complaining/bragging, no memes, no lfm, and no selling.

Again

Edit: We will be closing this at the end of today,False,,t5_2stl8,1370534411.0,mod,mod,t3_1fqo2o

Ok so far

5/25 were accounts that were created in the past day - currently leaning towards allowing them to win

6/25 numbers were NOT listed and will be randomly given away by myself.

1369557193.0,1f2oau,Need to get this off my chest...,Styruhfoam,86,20,36,"I apologize that there is a wall of text incoming

I know that what I'm about to complain about can't be effectively dealt with without a lot of effort; as such I'll accept the possibility that it might never be dealt with to begin with. Perhaps my plight is a niche problem; maybe there are not enough people suffering from this issue

For a while now, which was riddled with loss and defeat. But after much practice and pain, I broke even, and did decently. My stats still aren't great, but I use that as motivation to improve them. I still miss that Aegis by a second and get blown up by a Kraken, and I still miss that one auto attack needed to snag that kill; it fills me with frustration when they get away or I die not because I don't have skill, but because of something I can't control like internet connection. It does disappoint me knowing that no matter how good I get, but it's something I dealt with.

But now, my ping has become wildly out of control. I go from 200 - 1000 ping in seconds. And it happens far too frequently in critical moments where team fights were lost because I went from frozen in place in one moment, to a flurry of dead teammates in the next. I've learned to play with that 1 second lag from click to auto-attack by leading targets, but I simply can't learn to adapt to this. Moving in one direction for a second, and moving endlessly forward even with my hands of the keys, and then dying to the tower I just walked forward to. It's not possible. The thought that the effort I've put into the game to adapt to my unfortunate circumstances would be washed away by an insurmountable obstacle pains me. It really does. As I've said before, I don't know where this problem stems from; be it Hi-Rez's own unstable servers or something that went wrong on my end. This uncertainty compounds my frustration

Don't get me wrong, it still disappoints me that I might have lost another element of my life that I enjoy and put a good amount of effort into. I understand it's not Hi-Rez's responsibility to accommodate every single player out there, I don't blame them. If they made the servers stable, or even better, start a SEA server; I'd be grateful. But if they can't or they won't; there won't be spite, just self disappointment. I know there are a lot of people who have it much worse than I do, and please don't reply in saying so. What I'm saying doesn't discount that fact

I'm sorry that I can't be the best teammate to you guys because of this. It frustrates me just as much as it frustrates you. I've had experiences where I've done well but my teammates don't and we lose because of it. And I won't hesitate to admit that I'm guilty of blaming them. And it's a fact that I am greatly sorry for. It's only recently I've learnt that there are things that we can't see going on behind that person's screen, I wouldn't be the player I am now. It's only fair that I should allow them the liberty to push through that phase as well. For every bit of frustration that comes with a bad team, there might be even more that comes from the other person.

1374764473.0,1j13ve,"Tyr, Zhong Kui, Guan Yu and Hel Information",smitedataminer,75,106

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### **Tyr**

Tyr is a physical melee god. His gameplay mechanics will revolve around stance switching (assault/aggressive and guard/defensive stances).

Passives - Tyr will have a seperate passive in each stance. Passives will grant Tyr an on-hit buff proc which will then go on cooldown for a set amount of time before the passive proc can be used again. Tyr wields a sword in one hand and a cannon for the other.

1. **Charge* / Self Buff* (Aggressive / Defensive)** - Charges enemy god and added debuff effect. / Tyr applies a defensive buff to himself.

2. **Horizontal Hit (Aggressive / Defensive)** - Knocks any god into the air and additional bonus effect based upon which stance Tyr is currently in.

3. **AA Buff* / Cannon* (Aggressive / Defensive)** - Applies an auto attack buff to Tyrs sword for X seconds / Fires a medium ranged nuke projectile in a line in front of Tyr.

4. **Ultimate** - Switches stances

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### **Zhong Kui**

Zhong Kui is a physical ranged god. His gameplay mechanics will revolve around buffing/debuffing and potential demon pet mechanics. He will be heavily themed around orbs

*Order of abilities unknown at this time. Some of these abilities may be toggles or two step abilities

**Book of Demons** - Marks and removes mark on enemy and friendly gods.

**Expose Evil** - Projectile based attack.

**Exorcism** - This ability builds charges and has a potential phase shift attached to it. This phase shift may only be cosmetic however.

**Fierce Glare** - Deploys demon entity into the game world. 

**Recall Demon** - Usable on both enemy and friendly gods. Brings some benefit back to Zhong Kui upon use.

**Ultimate Demon** - More than likely Zhong Kui's ultimate. Shoots out a massive demon projectile.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### **Guan Yu Version 2**

Fortified Defense

Taolu Assault is not mentioned in his updated kit

*Wanted to add some clarification to this section. Taolu Assault is not mentioned with a V2 tag like the rest of his abilities are in the files. Instead we have his new ultimate and his old ultimate both mentioned with the V2 tag. This lead me to believe that Taolu Assault has been replaced

4. **Gallop Away** - Guan Yu's new ultimate ability involving his trusted warhorse. Gallop Away has three phases. Each phase lasts for a set amount of time and has a corresponding and scaling movement speed buff attached to it. Seems to function similar to Vamana's dash in terms of turning.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### **Hel Version 2**

Jingle Hel is getting reworked as part of V2 and will launch alongside the release of the new default model.

Stance switching works just like it does on live.

Has a healing beam as one of her new / altered abilities.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### **Other**

1373228320.0,1hti04,Smite as a community,Ashyko,92,34,125,"With my husband and two of my three children out-of-town

I first came to Smite because of my best friend. Competitive play had just begun, brought me to Denial eSports, and eventually, to reedit.

I don't know why, how so and so must be cheating... the list of complaints and criticism are fairly endless. Why, I now ask, is this the case? 

It all reminded me of an episode of The Guild (another thing Kaeyoh introduced me to). I'll link the episode here, developers) put their heart and soul into a game. For people like DMBrandon, MattyPocket, Qvofred, Bart, and all of the developers, Smite is their life and their passion.   

For us watching tournaments and playing, this game is someone's life. When you bash the developers and give no positive feedback at all, when you bring a swirling vortex of hate and misery with you to this game, it's as bad as telling a new mother that her baby is ugly and going to fail at life because she does. When you post in the smite twitch chat about how a player shouldn't be allowed to be on that channel because he's a liar or steals (and you have no first hand knowledge or evidence of either) you're slandering someone and costing them their life (and income). When you accuse people of cheating (for themselves or others) and you haven't witnessed it first hand or have substantial evidence, you call someone's life fake. When you accuse casters of being biased, of purposely trying to get teams disqualified, you're accusing someone of slander and again

It's very easy as an online sports fan to slander and slur others. It's easy, but our community as a whole should be filled with more positive than negative. We should be supporting those who love eSports. We should be cheering on every team that comes to competitive play.

As our community grows, those who have been here since Alpha, to be the positives. So many negatives will come in as Smite grows, and it's highly unlikely that everyone will always agree, but if we can, from the beginning, establish this as a community of thoughtful individuals rather than hateful ones, win or lose

We all love Smite. We might not all love each other

Sorry if you were expecting a full item guide for tanks

This idea came up after reading some posts of people that aren't left with anything to play but tank

Anyways

*1) Tanks are important for ANY team composition

*2) If you're going to tank

*3) As a tank

*4) You must protect your carry at all costs or until he manages to get away

*5) When you build tank, so expect to be caught in the middle of teamfights all the time, so for advice, BUY PLATED GREAVES, WALL OF ABSOLUTION and I found a really good idea to buy Creeping Curse, as coupled with the Thumper, people have a hard time getting away from it.

**Other useful items are ALWAYS Mark of the Vanguard, Bulwark of Hope, and one I really love, MIDGARDIAN MAIL... and if you're not getting Reinforced Greaves, try to leave a spot open for Hide of the Leviathan**

*6) Most tanks have CC and craploads of armor, if your carry is getting chased down, USE THE CC TO STOP THE ENEMIES... most of the time all that effort is thanked.

*7) (this taken from Allied's guide on Odin) You rotate wherever the AD carry rotates in lane

*8) When teamfights start going on

*9) This.. I can't get enough of this one because I love how it sounds... you're a TANK, if YOU die but helped set up amazing plays, you know you did your job right.

*10) Tanks should NOT be afraid to be solo laners, that way you'll help both your jungler and yourself. 

*edit: Let me explain this one as there seems to be lots of confusion going on around it: When you're solo, he's getting all that experience through ganks and buff camps, HENCE, you'll (a lot of times) overlevel the opposing lane and become harder to take down. Also, you're not trying to get kills, OR trying to push. You push the lane when your jungler/mid/any other teammate helps you zone out the opponents, OR when you KNOW YOUR ENEMIES ARE BACK IN THEIR BASES AFTER RECALLING

*11) Actives are always helpful but I find the best one is by far Purification Beads

edit: 

*12) TANK TOWERS IF YOU CAN, I missed it)


That concludes my ""guide"". If it gets downvoted to hell then so be it

GG!

1361641401.0,1934zp,Suggested Change for Hades,Booman61,65,8,21,"When playing Hades, thus the more damage you'll put out.

The problem with this comes in mid/late game. It is encouraged to level up Devour Souls first, it would be desirable to level up Death from Below, as it deals pretty good damage at higher levels and needless to say would benefit Hades' damage output significantly.

However I find myself reluctant to put points into Death from Below until last, leaving no blighted enemies to bomb. So Hades is unintentionally losing damage as he levels up.

How to fix this? I would suggest altering the Blight mechanic slightly. So imagine you have a minion standing here, a Broken Weave drops in the dead god's place. I think it would be good for Hades' Blight to linger around in the same manner until its total 5 second duration has been served.

This way, for upgrading his abilities. Also to clarify, this wouldn't just apply to the dash, I'm using it as an example. Another scenario would be Hades auto-attacking a few enemy minions to apply Blight, but then 2 seconds later your Wukong lane partner clears the whole wave with his Overhand Smash. Normally your Blight would be wasted, but with this suggested change, you would still have another 3 seconds to use the lingering Blight on the ground before its total 5 second duration has run out.

TL;DR - Any application of Blight should not disappear with the death of an enemy unit

I'm of course talking about gods like Tyr and Anhur. There's no excuse for gods like them to have two damaging skills that chain into each other due to hard CC and leave the victim stunned at the end so they can land additional auto attacks.

Take Anubis for example

For the two previously mentioned gods. Even if you use beads you still just took a ton of damage and will probably still die from their follow up attack.

Also a bit of information on why we choose Autism Speaks for this charity event. 

I myself am affected by Autism, speech was delayed and being able to use his words instead of his teeth, hands, or feet was a problem. Through much therapy and learning about this disorder him and our family were able to help out and give him the attention needed. So this charity event means a lot and I appreciate everyone that helps support, donate, or even spread the word of Autism, so we can also end the bullying of the special needs children. 

Fact : 1.6% of the world have Autism.
 60% of the world are gamers. 
About one out of every 88 children in the United States currently has autism.

her passive is laughable at best. I feel like it is a big reason she doesnt get much attention in both competetive and casual play.


**Zeus**: I feel like making his AAs travel 25%-40% faster would be a neat little addition, fire or wind.

He really does not have a true passive, but feels like something is missing. 


**Hades**: A small solution was to make enemies killed with blight leave a small mark (like neiths weaves) on the ground for a few seconds

someone has mentioned this before, gives amazing healing. but late game when a dash will clear some minions, it feels almost better to not level his dash at all to maximize the healing.

One of the main reasons for this incredible popularity is that there is a huge community of ex-WoW Arena players that simply have no other game to play right now.  WoW Arena has fallen off since TBC/WotLK, mostly due to the skilled nature of the 3rd person camera and skillshot-centric gameplay.

I implore HiRez and the rest of the community, what have you.  There is a massive MMO PvP community that just doesn't have a good arena game right now, and Smite can offer them that.

Hello Smiters

Besides the Balance and visual overhaul patch that is happening tomorrow and can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YFnAB8fwXYzK1yaxkQEpYhSwn0v5bh0eneQ6V9o8TI0/pub)

##Pantheon Flairs
Every pantheon now has its own flair. These are based off of the in-game flags you see when selecting a god. 

An image with all of them can be found [here](http://puu.sh/41si3.png) and their respective order is Chinese, Hindu, Mayan, Norse, Roman.

##Ao Kuang and Xbalanque flairs
The flair names of Ao Kuang and Xbalanque have been renamed (aok -&gt; aokuang | xbla -&gt; xbalanque), this caused both flairs to dissappear. If you had either of those as a flair please reselect them and you're good to go. Apologies for the inconvenience.

##Artemis flair
Artemis received her new picture snapshot instead of the outdated one.

##\#RememberTheManticore
Due to high request we decided to also implement a Manticore flair. He will always be in our minds!

This flair can be selected just as any other one

*In case you are not familiar with thise joke/memory, and his ability cooldowns were rather.. anarchistic), but people still loved him for the fact that he was something mysterious, as he could not be found anywhere else in Smite. When Hirez removed him, people were saddened to see that Ra took his place instead, and vouched for the Manticore's return. Hirez noted that he will possibly eventually reappear in the game, but they did not say he would return as a playable character. Recent datamining lead us to the discovery he will most likely just be a piece of the scenery, while most people would rather see him as a new buff camp monster

* -- Moving into game 3 Youngbae requests a re-game and informs the admin that he will be subbing out for ""Pixard"". Youngbae entered the game playing Anhur
* -- The admin granted a regame and allowed the substitution of Pixard.
* -- Pixard entered the game playing Ra and rotated another player (Lawbster) onto Anhur.
* -- The game was played and Bipolar Method killed the enemy's minotaur
* -- The admin team reviewed the game and realized the BM had breached the rules, who must use the same God of the player that was rotated out. Any substitutions during a re-game MUST be approved by an Administrator.*
* -- The game was decided to have been forfeit by BM. In this case the game could have been remade at the admin's discretion but

We would have preferred that the infraction was caught earlier and would have immediately informed BM that they had made a mistake

I have spoken with BM and explained the situation to them. Denial has been awarded a first place standing in this week's tournamnet

To clarify: Why not give the ""old"" skins a little patchup, but sometimes it isn't too hard. Just a different colour scheme is already cool. Altough, sometimes it may be a little harder, just a colour scheme change can do the job. 

The other issue is with specific gods that have a ""cheap"" skin (200 Gems / 11000 Favour), and many more. Just imagine how cool the Alienware ult would look: I be firin' mah lazooor!

1368766948.0,1ei1kc,dmbrandon's Change Wishlist Part 2: Gods!,dmbrandon,97,49,189,"**Agni:**
&gt;Noxious Fumes duration reduced to 5s.  (To prevent Gem of Isolation from controlling areas near objectives for 10s)
&gt;Path of Flames damage increased by 10% scaling.  Path Duration reverted back to 4s.  
&gt;Meteor damage decreased 15% scaling
Passive now applies on Path of Flames.

The goal here is allow Agni to get a bit more use out of Path of Flames


**Anhur:**
&gt;Desert Fury:  Now reads damage as:  65/95/125/155/185

This will make his death sentence of an ult a bit more manageable early game, and is in a great place.


**Anubis:**
&gt;Plague of Locusts:  Damage reduced by 10 at all levels.  Anubis can now move during Plague of Locusts
&gt;Death Gaze:  Will also now reduce damage taken by 30% for the duration.


**Ao Kuang:**
&gt;Passive increased to 10%.

The goal here is to make him a tad more bursty.  This should also make Book of Thoth (Which is still slightly overlooked) a more appealing option.  Coupled with Gem

**Aphrodite:**
&gt;Loving Embrace increased to 45%.

The 15% increase should make it more viable for aphro to get blue, and the major effectiveness of meditation, Aphro will be become an onslaught in lane.  Ymir has a large stun area, while she only has the option to stun one, and has very limited escape mechanics when linked.


**Apollo:**
&gt;The Moves:  Damage reduced at all level 1 by 10.  Scaling reduced to 50%
&gt;Across the Sky:  First 2 seconds of riding are free.  Subsequent seconds are now 65 mana.
Serenade:  protections given are reduced to 10/15/20/25/30

Apollos damage right now is a tad too high.  His passive, he's become very tank.  A lot of people have overlooked the fairly insane damage that The Moves puts out.  As of now, it's been a pretty brain dead decision to level the ult last, so by allowing the moves to be a tad bit weaker, and buffing the ult cost, the builds might not be so cookie cutter.  This will also encourage more ganking.

Serenade has made him far too tanky, and protection buffs.  The protections have been nerfed to encourage him to not kill everything he sees for free.



**Arachne:**
&gt;Cocoon:  The web shot can now be used  to latch onto walls and enemies alike.  When holding the mouse button down

This change does a few things!  First off, and much faster, using that 30s cooldown to move around the map freely, and far more easily, the ganks and jungling become a much more realistic thing.  (Thanks to the reddit users who posted this idea!)


**Ares:**
&gt;Shackles:  Duration reduced from 4s to 2.5.  May now apply four.

This does two great things for Ares!  First, which did close to absurd damage.  No, it did absurd damage.  What's beyond absurd.  It did that.  But now, you're going to have to be smarter with the shackles.  Applying 1-2-1-2, instead of 1-2-1 allow him to be a tad more dangerous, but he must be quicker, and more accurate to get the full damage off.

Overall, especially in teamfights!


**Artemis:**
&gt;Calydonian Boar: Stun is now 1.5 seconds at all levels.  Boar health now scales with leveling as well. 300/600/900/1200/1500

The boar is great early, as letting roam free will no longer be an option.  Teams will have to coordinate to be able to get that boar controlled, while Artemis has the chance to use taps more effectively during major fights.


**Bacchus:**
&gt;Drunk-o-meter:  Now empties 15% faster.
&gt;Chug:  Mana cost now scales: 40/60/80/100/120.  Meter increased by 20/25/30/35/40.  Protections increased 20/25/30/35/40
&gt;Belly Flop.  Animation made slower

This forces a more mana intensive Bacchus.  By reducing the costs of Chug, or keeping the mana to use for abilities.  Chug will be more vital in his gameplay than it was before, making it a more appealing choice when leveling.


**Bakasura:**
&gt;Eat Minion:  Protection buff is now 8s.  Minions eaten are no longer lost upon death.  Minions may be eaten from allied team.

Regurgitate will now be a tad more viable with minions not being lost.  The now 8s buff will also allow Baka to eat from lane and join teamfights in jungle with a tad more survivability.  Giving him the option to eat his own minions


**Bastet:**
&gt;Nine Lives changed to Leader of the Pack:  15% physical Power Buff for each spawned Cat alive.  When all die
&gt;Cat Call:  Spawned cats now take 66% less damage from God Abilities.  Hand of the Gods functions as normal.  Damage now 20/30/40/50/60.  Cats no long despawn when Bastet is killed.

Stop dying!  These changes will allow Bastet's ult to be a more prominent feature of how she's payed.  The protection buff and damage buff will completely change how pounce is used in team fights, so to stop Bastet's onslaught of damage reduction, power boots, and cc immunity, you're gonna need to get those cats down.


**Cupid:**
&gt;Share the Love:  Mana regained when allies pick up hearts now scales with cost.  Two hearts worth the cost of placing.
&gt;Flutter:  Attack speed buff increased to 5/15/25/35/45.
&gt;Fields of Love:  Slow reduced to 25%

The change to Share the Love ensures that you're not always going to choose to level flutter.  Flutter's attack speed buff will now play well with his passive.

But, people will have to really work with their lane partners to ensure the stun or mesmerize off of fields of love!


**Fenrir:**
&gt;Ragnarok:  At full runes

The protection buff initially was designed to save him, the runes were saved for insane healing, a stun, or splash damage.  This movement speed increase will allow him to have a better escape, or a better initiate.  It will only last 4s though, to not allow fenrir to pull people farther than he really should be able.


**Freya:**
&gt;Brisingamen's Blessing:  Conversion increased to 33%.
&gt;Valkyrie's Discretion:  Base damage reduced to 100/130/160/190/210

The idea here, Executioner and more will see more of a varying playstyle in Freya.


**Guan Yu:**
&gt;Tranquil Gift:  Healing Increased to 60/90/120/150/180 + 40 % of your magical power.  (Up from 30%.)
&gt;Tactician's Advantage:  Magical Scaling decreased from 25% to 20% 

Guan's 1 is generally used as a last resort, to put him in line with other supports as well.


**Hades:**
&gt;Blight: 1

This gives hades more freedom of application and use of Blight.  Slows from attacks, keeping it safe for his partner. This also allows hades to set up kill opportunities for himself in midlane much, much easier.


**He Bo:**
&gt;Water Cannon's Scaling reduced to 75%.  (Down from 90.)

It does too much damage. Come on.


**Hel:**
&gt;Cleanse:  Cleanse now functions at frame 6
&gt;Hinder:  Slow now 10/15/20/25/30.

This makes the 2 a more attractive option early game, due to the small duration of the immunity.


**Hercules:**
&gt;Due to recent changes to the character


**Kali:**  
&gt;Enrage:  The 25% lifesteal will now activate upon reaching 50% HP

This will allow her to sustain for a bit longer in major team fights.  Generally, or is going to be retreating.  Either way, not a good way to utilize the passive.  As it stands, the passive is only useful in a 1v1 or 1v2 scenario, when no CC is available to the enemy team.


**Loki:**
&gt;Decoy:  Enemies in the area of Decoy will incur a 10% movement penalty.  Enemies who take damage from decoy will have a 3s 25% slow applied to them.

Loki can only kill one person at a time.  Little CC in a game full of hard CC is a death sentence.  This Small buff to his least used move for team fights should allow Loki a bit more freedom in both chasing and escaping.


**Ne Zha:**
&gt;Due to recent changes


**Neith:**
&gt;Broken Weave:  Weaves can now be seen from 25 feet farther.
&gt;Unravel:  Diameter reduced by 15%.


**Odin:**
&gt;Lunge:  Now reduced protections of enemies who are hit by Lunge by 5/10/15/20/25 for 4s.

Odin's jump is the only jump that doesn't have an added effect.  This jump passive would make blink less of a viable choice, most people use Lunge to escape, or plainly to initiate for the ult.  This change will enforce a slightly more thoughtful Odin, to maximize the damage.


**Poseidon:**
&gt;No changes!  Poseidon is in a great spot right now.


**Ra:**
&gt;Celestial Beam:  The beam now has the ability to ""double tap

Ra's damage has been very low as of late


**Sobek:**
&gt;No Changes!  Sobek is in a great place.


**Sun Wukong:**
&gt;Somersault:  Damage increased to:  70/110/150/190/230 + 80% scaling.  (Up from 70%)

A small increase in damage should help Wukong's fading early game.  Early in the game's lifespan, and the addition of over a dozen gods with brilliant CC, Monkey needed a small boost in damage!


**Thor:**
NO CHANGES!  ODIN BORE *MANY CHILDREN!*


**Vamana:**
&gt;Colossal Fury:  Healing per second reverted back to 5%.  Movement speed increased when giant by 25%.

Big Baby needs to get in there and get things done.  With the extra healing, the movement speed will allow his ult to do damage outside of those cluster**** team fights.  Chasing is important with baby.  His kit is generally applied to be a chaser.  The frisbee toss is a slow, an AOE cone damage, and the baby dash, he needs a way to stay in the fight.


**Vulcan:**
&gt;Volcanic Overdrive:  Using Volcanic Overdrive will cause Thumper and Inferno Cannon's cooldowns to be refreshed.

Nothing sucks more than popping your ~~xfactor~~ Volcanic Overdrive


**Xbalanque:**
I honestly can not come up with anything that won't just inherently break this character.  Changes to anything, to far, far beyond, due to his scaling, and branching bolas.  SORRY!


**Ymir**
&gt;Glacial Strike:  Now actives in a wave.  Frame 6 at the start of his feet
&gt;Shards of Ice:  SoI can now be canceled at any point for 1/4th the damage.  (Does not increase with time

This will given Ymir a real option for fighting in a 1v1 scenario, and in major damage lanes, could even pass freeze at certain levels.

The SoI change again works with the passive

**Zeus:**
&gt;Overcharge:  Three stacks now electrocute an enemy
&gt;Aegis Shiled:  Reduces CC duration by 30% while active.

Zeus's passive is plain.  Like, instead of waiting on detonate.  This makes a lot of things more attractive.  Fatalis/Frostbound hammer late game to keep stacks up and slow to wait on detonate?  Gem of Isolation second to keep people in the ult and keep stacks up as long as possible?  Yum.

Zeus' real issue lies in escapes.  So a simple CC reduction of 30% on Aegis would allow him a bit more freedom of movement.  Thanks to the buff on the ult

Hello everyone! I went through and took all the data from Day 1 of the monthly finals today to see what was being the most contested and what was having the most success. (Will also update this for tomorrow's data)

Day 1 : http://imgur.com/YowXFAF

Day 1 + 2 : http://imgur.com/FsqiBtK

While we don't have the largest sample size and it isn't the most accurate data as to how powerful everyone actually is

1. Currently teams are favoring a heavy tank style of play. Gods like Bacchus/Hercules/Sobek/Vamana/Ymir/Guan were all huge picks that teams were getting. Ra who can also be considered 'tanky' was also hugely sought after. Another common strain is that these tanks have a lot of CC

2. Hel fell out of favor hard. With one patch she went from a must have to not even worth fighting over.

3. Ranged AD seems to not only have fallen out of favor, and the only Ranged AD that was picked consistantly was Xbalanque.

4. Currently Wukong/Thor/Hercules/Vamana are the Melee Carries of choice. Kali/Bastet/Baka/Arachne were not picked once

5. Agni/Ra are pretty much the only two mids atm. While Ao/Anubis were also picked

These are just some of the things I noticed from collecting the data and participating in the tournament. If anyone has questions about the graph or wants to discuss my points/add onto them I am gonna be checking this thread a lot. This is a good chance to get a discussion going :)

The event itself was drawing a lot of attention to the Smite booth and I talked to countless new players who loved the game

The showmatch of us (SNIPE) vs. Dignitas was a blast. The hype for both teams was nearly even and the first two matches reflected how intense competitive smite matches can be. Sure there were some little technical issues that disrupted the set

&gt;Overall we are happy about the new map since it's generating more action. This is mostly measured by looking at how soon kills start
&gt;
&gt;Overall match time has not changed much (it's within a minute of the pre-patch time) while respawn time has been reduced from 90 to 75 sec which is something we like.
&gt;
&gt;Damage has increased overall
&gt;
&gt;That said
&gt;
&gt;A few other small changes are coming to the map including making the side lanes a bit wider at certain areas and some improvements to the FoW.
&gt;
&gt;We are also interested in making mid lane a bit more important and may increase the gold value of those towers.
&gt;
&gt;Bumba's mask will also be revised to work with some of the jungle changes in the next patch.
&gt;
&gt;Lastly

**And also:**

&gt;Over time we plan to move each God to one damage [magical damage or physical damage] type to make it simpler to understand and allows us to create more interesting items to support those builds.

1374009995.0,1ifwfh,Diem's Early Theory Crafting for 7/17,dmbrandon,85,41,101,"**Map Changes:**

&gt;Gold Denial:  You no longer get gold from minions that have taken damage from your tower.

This is AMAZING.  The game takes forever in its current state.  With this change it will do two things:  1)  Demands more aggression in lane

Aggression in lane means that people will be forced to fight more.  The passivity you've all been complaining about will be out the window, Sobek/...anything, Fenrir/Aphro or Anhur, Freya/Ares.  There are a ton of fun comps.  This will also, after some short theory work, bring Arachne back to the lane.  (You'll have to tune into the stream tomorrow to see this.)

The Jungler's role will be scary now!  Because of the aggression, putting an even bigger emphasis on speed buff.  Missed opportunities are going to hurt the jungler a lot, so expect less overall ganks opportunities, as falling behind is no longer an option.  There will be little room to make it up.

&gt;The ""Gold Fury Lane!:""  The space in between the tier 1 towers have been increased.  

It's all but guaranteed that this is where you'll see the duo go.  The extra room is designed to ensure that the two sets of opponents are fighting for creep pushes

Wards. Wards. Wards.  Last hitting is gonna be very important to gain the biggest lead possible.  And watch your map!  If you see the enemy jungler in the opposite lane or in mid, to stop from being denied too much. 

Watchers will be necessary on supports it feels in the duo.

Mana/Cooldown Camps:  The four corner camps will now have buffs that provide both Mana Regen and Cooldown Reduction.  A'la League's Blue buff.

A great change for right lane.  Cooldown was useless until 15-17 minutes generally

**Items:**

&gt;Heartseeker/DoomOrb:  You now gain 2 stacks for god kills.;  On death

Expect both items to start making a come back.  Especially HS, you can expect that with the movement speed attached, this will be the go to item for junglers.  Possibly boots1&gt;HS, for quicker stack gain.  Maybe even forgoing boots until HS is finished altogether.  Will need testing.  Movement is very, very important.

Doom Orb will have a major benefit on characters who can push quickly and safely like Ao and Ra.  Now those characters who were susceptible to ganks

&gt;Shard: Tier 3 - Restoration Shard
Using this item gives you a health and mana heal equal to 4% of your maximum health and mana

&gt;Tier 3 - Static Shard
Using this item gives yourself a shield that reflects 2% of damage done to you back to the attacker


Restoration really isn't all that different than Meditation.  Less mana

Shard, and then Regen.  Characters like Chronos and Baby who can get HP back very, very quickly can use this to help dish out damage.  Since Kali has built in CC immunity, this probably wouldn't be too terrible, as she can also heal up a bit.  Her high burst coupled with a 20% reflect on all damage could be pretty scary.  Obviously will need testing.

&gt;The Voids!:  Nurphed

Little to talk about here.  Slight nerfs to both items.  Better passive's for single players, as these items were core on too many gods in almost any scenario.

Defense and pure damage is a dangerous, including some tanks.  Pretty crazy.  Now, a bit more thought will go into when these items are purchased.  Maybe.  We'll see!


&gt;Shield:  This is a new 3 tier item with 2 top tier branches

Runic Shield is more important, unless after major testing it shows bulwark being stronger due to HP.  Either way, there is a lot of potential! 

&gt;Gem of Binding:  New Gem tier 3:  Enemies hit by your basic attacks will move 25% slower for 2 seconds.

This is a HUGE pickup for characters like Vulcan, who will gain amazing CC potential and HP.  Expect this going into late game, or the later stages of mid game.  On magical in-hansd, might come even sooner.  Freya will have slows permanently, Chronos's chases will be much more rewarding as well!

This is a very scary item.  Coupled with Poly


&gt;Bumba's mask:  The full XP reward bonus for not getting the last hit has been removed.  You still get the full gold reward bonus when not getting the last hit.  

See the Map changes for laning to see my opinion how to approach the new Bumba's.

&gt;Teleport/ShieldedTele:  Teleport has been reduced in price by half

A hefty price tag to go not very far

&gt;Nemian Lion (As per twitter posts from Bart/Chris:)  Damage reflect changed to 30% to 20%

This will start to fall off greatly, permanently.

**Gods**

&gt;Ares:  Voidstone got nerfed.  

This hurts an already weak character. :(  No theorycrafting

&gt;Isis:  Ouch.

Ult got smacked with the nerfbat.  Less Objective control due to damage reduction getting nerfed and longer cooldown.  Overall, though, which is a great thing.

&gt;Vulcan: Nightmare.

Forcing turret behavior is something players have wanted for a long time.  This could be massive, as he's super tanky, has a fair escape, and can push so safely!

If anything, try something like VF1 (Enemy Missing Left) *god name*. 



Most importantly perhaps, but your character also reads it out for your whole team to hear. This makes it amazing for pubs because you're able to still focus like you would while in vent/teamspeak/mumble/skype while being in a game with randoms. Pretty incredible imo



Depending on how terrible my formatting is

Simply Press V to start the sequence



**V**

&gt; **A** (attack)

    1 (left) - ""Attack Left Lane!""
    2 (middle) - ""AttackMiddle Lane!""
    3 (right) - ""Attack Right Lane!""



&gt; **D** (defend)

    1 (left) - ""Defend Left Lane!""
    2 (middle) - ""Defend Middle Lane!""
    3 (right) - ""Defend Right Lane!""      
      


&gt; **G** (gank)

    1 (left) - ""Gank Left Lane!""
    2 (middle) - ""Gank Middle Lane!""
    3 (right) - ""Gank Right Lane!""       
      


&gt; **F** (MIA)

    1 (left) - ""Enemy missing left!""
    2 (middle) - ""Enemy missing middle!""
    3 (right) - ""Enemy missing right!""  
      


&gt; **R** (retreat)

    1 (left) - ""Retreat left lane!""
    2 (middle) - ""Retreat middle lane!""
    3 (right) - ""Retreat right lane!""   
      


&gt; **E** (emote)

    J (joke) - &lt;plays joke&gt;
    L (laugh) - &lt;plays laugh&gt;
    T (taunt) - &lt;plays taunt&gt;
      


&gt; **T** (returned)

    1 (left) - ""Enemies have returned left!""
    2 (middle) - ""Enemies have returned middle!""
    3 (right) - ""Enemies have returned right!"" 
      


&gt; **I** (incoming)

    1 (left) - ""Enemies incoming left!""
    2 (middle) - ""Enemies incoming middle!""
    3 (right) - ""Enemies incoming right!"" 
      


&gt; **V** (other)

    H (help!)
      
    B (Be right back!)

    K (Steping away for a moment.)

    G (Nice Job!)

    T (Thanks!)

    O (Ok!)

    C (Cancel that!)

    Y (Yes!)

    N (No!)




Following this we can see how easy it is to not only give out a lot of specific information

1376485153.0,1kcfqt,Undocumented patch changes,Xeran_,54,8,79,"###**Olympus patch 14-08**


I though let's make again a list of things

*If you have an undocumented change, god cards, etc.*

###Launcher splash art

*A reminder by Zaap005*

The game launcher for Smite also now has the updated Thor image. 

### Username and password typing sound

*Thanks to the good hearing of Geletin*

This sound is now changed and is less noisy (just listen for your self XD)

###No god cons

*Found by gruntmaster1*

The god tooltips don't have cons anymore.

###Fog of war in joust

Joust has now fog of war like Conquest. 

###Jungle practice mode (MAJOR ONE!!!)

Jungle practice has its art overhaul (maybe partly yet). Splash art didn't get updated for it

[Pictures](http://imgur.com/yWbyYIN,F854I2C,D1AbCZc,N27L2qK,sTyjJCt)

The art style is now again in line with the new conquest map art style and features the new base, etc. 

###Arachne golden skin

*Thanks to Apoctis*

Arachne now has golden spiders on her gold skin

###Health and mana pots

*Thanks to OblivionKnight92*

The mana and health pots have again swapped places in the item store...

*Also Aegis (and other actives) are also switched places. Thanks to shadowpenguin29*

###Exp bar on top in the lobby

*Thanks to AeromaaX*

It's now completely filled after some complaints. 

###Minimize button 

*Found by JoeXL*

The minimize button has been added again when using borderless window mode.

###Teleport consumable

*Found by ExplosionNois*

The Teleport interface has been improved and towers now pop (maybe also for wards with active

###Frostmaiden skin (Freya)

*Found by AeromaaX*

Freya's Frost Maiden skin has updated fx to match the previous Freya fx updates too. Her ult now also makes icy spikes appear up from the ground when shooting.

****

*This is just

This could be done from tomorrow on with the All-Chat function that'll be added to Challenge matches and just sheer good-will and experienced players posting IGN so new ones can add and learn gameplay and etiquette. Thank you.*

**THIS is the most important part of it**

Hello everyone, or the various questions regarding the basics of the game.

Anyways, frequently being paired with players that are levels too high for them to tackle at their current state, and that just destroy them and (in some cases and regrettably) drive them out of Smite, which just makes the Smite community fall short and the game not grow.

I think we should do something about that.

I've read, even when just being in Beta**. That being said, I think we should take advantage of that and help out the new players that are just trying to improve so we keep it that way.

Also, PLEASE HELP OUT NEW PLAYERS**. I'd hate to see people leave Smite and the community because they can't take on people that are smurfing and just beat them senseless everytime they play or that make it seem like they just suck at playing a certain God and demotivate them. This can be changed though, in the incoming patch, all CHALLENGE matches will have an option available for ""All-Chat"", this is one of the solutions. Why? Because I think it'd be a great idea if some people (if it's considered a good idea I'll make it public, if not, PM me for the IGN) that are in the higher levels could help out. Personally I'm a level 30, not just from me
And not just teach gameplay, not DCing, no AFKing, no BULLYING, etc, because even though right now AFKing is not punished by more than 30 minutes of a penalty, it makes a whole team have to adjust itself to the lost-teammember and sometimes deal with constant rants, everyone of us started at Level 1 and a really big number of us started as a feeder and got flamed by the whole team.


I love the game and I'd hate for the community to eat itself up

(**Tip: TrendKiLLv01 has uploaded -as to date- three beginner guides for new smite players, I'll post some links at the end... along with a video that explains it, people can IN GAME help explain the VGS for example**).

Last but not least, AFKers, or just bad natured players out there that (if not punished directly by Hi-Rez) aren't punished or taught by more experienced players... keeping silent never helps against flaming. Those people really drive people out of the community and make it toxic, which is why the competitive scene doesn't grow, it doesn't have much to do with the game being in Beta stages (just watch streams by PonPon, Allied, Anatoliy, Zapman

Current most popular methods to get your IP are from **Skype** (Anyone can get your IP from skype even without adding you to contacts or call to you. All you need to know is skype username), because usernames are not unmaskable), **Mumble**, **Ventrillo**, **TeamSpeak**, **Raidcall** (You do not even need to be an admin on those to get someone's IP. Thank god it requires to have some kind of a skill to actually get the IP. To stop it you have to add proxy to them or use VPN), and **Tinychat** (Not even going to explain how people can get IP from it but it is hard as shit). Those are the most popular programs where your IP can be leaked. 

To stop people getting your IP from Skype there are few methods:

**A)** Proxy for Skype

Good explained tutorial on how to do it: http://imgur.com/a/NpFdW


**B)** VPN (Virtual Private Network)

VPN will work but it also affects your gameplay and anything else you do with your internet. Yes some VPN's has settings where you can just choose on where you want to use VPN


**C)** Log in to skype via Microsoft/Facebook accounts

**---REMOVED--- because after new skype update which happened few hours ago


**D)** IMO.IM (http://imo.im)

This is a simple website which will allow you to use skype through their servers. Basically you go to that website


So, TeamSpeak, or Raidcall servers; 2% public IRC chats. 


**ALSO** Do not forget to change your IP once you either add proxy to skype, and if you won't change your IP he can basically just target your real IP.

- Most people can only have fun the 50% +/- of the time they are winning. As soon as fellow players start dying they drag others down into their pits of pessimism.

- This has been covered but YELLING AT PEOPLE FOR NOT CALLING MISSING does not help any better then asking ""call mia next time mid

- Complaining that someone misses a skill shot, EVEN IF THEY ARE TERRIBLE. Encourage, don't instigate. I've heard a lot of people counter this point with ""Well noobs don't listen to my advice"". Personally I can't tell you if this is true or not, but every single tip and trick another respectful player has given me I have used.

- Group harassment mentality… has only happened a few times but when it does

Now this is my first moba, YES your anger is ""justifiable"" on occasion, and YES apparently there are ""more"" toxic communities then Smite. But do we want to be a better community or the best?

Sorry for the all the ranting. I know simply complaining doesn't change the game but my hope is people will start refusing to sit by and let rages pick on others. If there are any likeminded individuals who want to:

- Play with people that can have fun even when losing

- Never complain or blame others

- Always respectful to everyone unless picking on a friend as a joke

- Always positive and optimistic

- Reacts to stressful situations with humor

- Doesn't stick to one role the entire time (carry instalockers I'm looking at YOU)

Then get in touch with me… I'd be honored to battle beside you and pick up Smite once again!

* *1st* - Can I play **every** Position in current meta? ....Well if you don't know what the meta is **YOU SHOULD** that means ask around maybe watch some *streams/tournaments* as of right now (08-29-12) The current smite meta-game is a Tank left with a jungler

* *2nd*   **Learn how to use and** **BUY** [HAND OF THE GODS](http://smitedb.com/ability/hand-of-the-gods/) **at the beginning of every game**.. doesn't matter your position

* *3rd* **Do not auto lock a god at champ select**...(*This will change with bans and draft picks but for now*) **do not call a position** simply ask if you can...It will usually get you what you want. 

* *4th* If you are struggling in lane aka Getting Stomped...**Ask for help** and don't blame your team for your bad play...don't say (ie ""NO HELP MID THAT'S WHY I'M GETTING CRUSHED"") just before you are to far behind just ask for help....stop and type for 1 fucking second that way you can't only blame yourself...the map is huge we don't know if your doing well or poorly....speak up...we are reading!!!!

* *5th* If your build isn't working don't be stubborn build something else next game....or **find a pro/really good player and ask them what they are building**....for instance a player in my bracket was building Bakasura wrong every game we played so if he was on the opposing team we won...on my team we lost....I politely mentioned to him that this is the build that I use....guess what...he is crushing this game now....and every game since that I have played with him...

* *6th* If someone is doing poorly...**help them** do not ~~flame them~~ it helps no one...**IT HELPS....NO ONE**!!!! if they are feeding ask them to play safer...if they are RAMBOING every fucking thing ask them if they could stick to the team and or go to them and force them into team play.......

* *7th* My most important point....remember this is a Moba...and In moba's its mostly a numbers game....**try and back out of any lopsided engagements** (ie a 2v4...or a 4v5 or if they have FG) you only want to **fight advantageous engagements** ie if you have 3 and they have 2.....you have fg and they have a man down.. or best of all if they have no ults and you do....

* 
For example Ares is marked as High CC and Low Damage. But he actually does quite a lot of damage.

Hitting Ares chains perfectly having full AP build will do more damage than Ao Kung's ult. That's a lot of damage.

*Besides his ult, Hades fear, even sobek/anubis wrap/grab. High CC is not something, IMO, would use to describe him.*

I guess I can concede that he does have good/high CC

* Artemis should have a Con as Low Mobility the only ADC without a dash/leap

I would give Anubis/Arachne a ""Low mobility"" as a con

* Bastet has 2 cons: Low CC
But Kali is the only god to have absolutely no CC. And bastet has 2 forms of CC. While Baka has 1 form of CC. Why kali no has ""Low CC""?
 
* Hades, Vulcan are described as Tank's. But I would refer to them as magical bruisers. I always build more AP items on them than say Sobek/Bacchus/Ymir/... Some times you mage Hade's mid and use your ult on less ambitious targets so you don't suicide.

It says Hades is support. but his heal is hard to control (to heal others like Guan Yu) and his CC is weaker than say bacchus or ymir. Hade's isn't much more of a support than Ymir/Bacchus IMO. But Ymir and Bacchus don't have support listed?

Vulcan is described as a pusher

* And of course Tyr is marked as low damage. When he actually does quite a bit of damage. His #1 damage is between Thor's spin to win and Fenrir's brutalize your face off.

Vamana is described as low damage. But vamana has actually quite high burst and hitting his ult right can do shit tons of damage. But maybe with his CD's he has low damage overall.

Odin is given ""Low Damage"" but that is not something I would discribe him as. Against an anubis

* And Freya I would discribe as a Ranged/Melee Magical, and only on occasion use her melee autos.

* Since it seems like Junglers are in the game now, Athena. Athena and hebo have shown to be successful junglers even Posiden. But for example its been shown that artemis is not a good jungler.

As far as I saw only Arachne was mentioned as a Jungler

* Thor is described as a bruiser. But I think he is also an assassin being able to ult from nowhere. Most people use thor to jungle and build him high damage.

If Arachne doesn't get super fed you have to build her bruiser/tank late game to survive team fights.

* Lastly I think another role to consider is solo lane or ""Solo"".

If you are new here

##What is /r/Smite and what are those other subreddits?
/r/Smite is a community-created environment for people to talk about nearly anything that is /r/Smite related. Even though we are not officially affiliated with Hirez, of course.

Posts may contain nearly everything, group, or one member to fill a team, please take a look at /r/SmiteLFM. If you like to suggest a god concept, you're welcome to post one here. If you desire to have elaborate and lots of feedback on it, we recommend checking out the independent /r/SmiteGodConcepts, where the mods will review each suggestion and give their commentary.

In case you feel like meeting other people who play smite and talking to them through voice chat

##What is that cool tag behind people's names?
You may see people have a picture of a god or team logo behind their name, Chang'e, and Hun Batz are unavailable as of right now. The top 5 teams from NA/EU combined are slightly outdated as well, this will also be patched. Hirez employees and /r/Smite mods have special flair. They are a Hirez logo and a Bumba's mask respectively.

##How does my post get a subject tag?
As you browse on the subreddit you may notice the coloured tags in front of most post titles. This is post flair, as it will be there as soon as any of the mods has some free time to assign all posts a flair if they haven't one yet. The meanings of the flairs speak for themselves, of course.

##My post does not appear?
What happens if you submit a post and it's not showing up in the ""NEW"" tab after roughly 3 minutes? Well, just send us a moderator mail and we'll fix your post right away. Do not try to resubmit the same post, however, as it will most likely be removed as well and only make you more susceptible to post removal (the Reddit algorithm checks the likelihood of you being a spammer by looking at how many posts of you have been removed in the past).

##Err
The wiki is now open for editing! You will require 50 karma gained on this subreddit and an account age of 30 days in order to contribute.

##I have a question or suggestion for the mods of /r/Smite
If you have constructive criticism or questions about the subreddit itself don't hesitate to send us a modmail through /r/Smite! In this way it is guaranteed at least one of the moderators will read your message. You are free to make meta-suggestions in selfposts here

##Whats up with these ""official"" subreddits
As of today, and bug reports to /r/SmiteBug. /r/OfficialSmite seems to be private as I write this, but this may change soon. Patch notes will also be posted here on this subreddit by either Bart or one of the mods. Those three reddits are officially maintained by Hirez enployees, and not by the community.

Once again, which can be done by blicking the big red button at the end of the sidebar.

**Enjoy your time!**

1. The way its implemented right now means that if im in lane looking into the jungle, very disorientating.

2. When leaving the jungle the fog of war effects stays for a second in the lanes

Be careful what you wish for:

A year ago the devs played with the idea of ""offerings"" to be placed on ""shrines

For those of you unfamiliar: It's an out of game stat customization system. You would buy offerings with favor, etc) they could give to your god. Each God got one ""Shrine"" free, and you could buy two more. You placed the offerings on the shrines for each god, and that god would have its stats boosted by some small amount in game depending on what offerings were on the shrine equipped. These offerings last forever once bought.

Back then, I imagine because at the time it seemed like a needless timesink for a game so early in beta. For whatever reason, I can't find anything about them on the forums anywhere, but there's a video from forever ago where you can see them in game ""under construction""

[Here it is](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3Utkl5iCdo)

 * These are the problems with the current solo lane with some suggestions to fix it. Maybe it will help

 1v1 lane has no trading blows

Here is the current ""Metagame"" in the solo lane. 

Mark of Vanguard - Mystical Mark - Reinforced Boots - More tank stuff

Meditation 3
Blink

The problem is there is no real ""trades"" that happen. There are matchups but however most of the 1v1 lanes happen between Guan Yu

If you end up 1v1ing usually both players start extremely Tanky and build into more Tanky items. After a certain point there is no trading what so ever

Possible solutions- Nerf tank items 

* Tank items are too strong to stack

Example. Hide of the Nemean Lion - 2250gold	 +80 Physical Protection	 +200 Health Passive - PASSIVE - Reflects 30% of all basic attack damage back to the attacker as magical damage.

Rushing this item alone

* Characters overall ""tank stats"" need to be toned down.

 Like Odin for example. No reason he should be so naturally tanky its absolutely absurd. At max rank Odin's Gungir's might gives 60 physical protection naturally

This is just 1 of the many tanks problems on top of doing pretty good damage and have insane utility.

- ad (attack damage) carry is now pp (physical power) carry. Reasoning: Firstly
Secondly, due to them both relying on basic attacks and abilties to carry.





- ap (ability power) carry is now mp (magical power) carry. Reasoning: Similair reasoning as with attack damage. However, ultimately busting the term.





- aa (auto attack) is now ba (basic attack). Reasoning: basic attacks are neither self continuous nor automaticly hitting

1. Just wanted to say first and foremost that this mode is about taking and holding possession of the obelisks. Unfortunately this does not seem to be understood by some people.

2. Chasing kills is a sure way to lose towers. Most of the time you are being baited to leave your tower undefended. 

3. When your team is down and you only have one tower it is not worth having 2 people defending the one tower your team owns. Only have one defend and have the rest storm a tower. 

4. When storming a tower don't choose the one that they have 4 people defending.

5. Many like to start with a 0-3-2 but personally I think that a 2-1-2 is the best starting configuration this allows your team to easily take the unattended tower and it is easy to shift over once the unattended tower is taken

reposted on this forum section from general discussion

Introduction. (Patch 0.1.1288.8) Updated 1/18/2013

I'm *Allied* from Juice Gaming



Tier 1 - Hel, Ymir, Agni

Tier 2 -Bacchus, Thor, Odin, Hades, Guan Yu, He bo, Anhur

Tier 3 -Artemis, Bakasura, Bastet, Ares, Cupid, Xbalaque, Loki

Tier 4 -Kali

Hard to place - Hercules


**Tier 1** - Right now the trend in the competitive scene is Healing and Tanks. Healing is way too strong and tanks are way too tanky. You noticed that Agni snuck back into Tier 1, natural tankyness and healing. On Top of that Sobek and Ymir are top picks atm because of the Ymir buff (3 second freeze lol wat?) and Sobek's utility is off the charts with his insane passive (hits harder than some AD carries do at level's 1-5).

**Tier 2** - As you noticed bacchus is on top mostly because remember that ""nerf"" to his chug? well imo that ended up being a insane buff because now hes even tankier

Vamana is back now because of his insane buff (CC immunity in ult form and focus removed from his HP regen while he is in Ult form). Thor is just a super good AD carry now because of his really good utility while being able to dish out TONS of damage.

Guan Yu drops down because simply the constant abuse of being overnerfed patch after patch has really taken toll but its also amazing because i've never seen a character so overnerfed and still be a solid pick.

Ao Kuang Snuck on to Tier 2 because in situations when Ra and Hel are banned

**Tier 3** - Not too much has changed besides Zeus and Freya moving up

Why ares so low? even with the buff, Ares barely gets picked anymore. Hes still pretty solid just pretty lackluster compared to Ymir / Sobek, etc

Yeah i know, and considering how tanky you can get without really trying, Squishy Loki has a hard time preforming his job of Assassinating, ESPECIALLY in a teamfight when you have Sobek and Ymir CCing you to death. Making him a EXTREME counterpick character, hes still really solid and you may see him occasionally but that requires the right circumstances for him to come out.

**Tier 4?** well heres the thing these characters just don't fit anywhere i feel

**Hercules?** well yes hes OP but no team has tried him out in a competitive scrim yet! hes auto banned because of tournaments



Explaination on Tiers

**Tier 1**- You WANT to pick these gods as soon as possible, they have really little counters - These are your 1st - 2nd picks

**Tier 2** - These are after the initial picks

**Tier 3** - These are situational picks and counterpicks but with good team communication you can use these gods to make your team really strong

(New)**Tier 4**- These characters are hard to place on a competitive team atm because they have certain problems or lack the qualities needed to compete with other good picks

1371308096.0,1gegkd,God Skin Ideas,LolSnowman,49,14,44,"I've been playing Smite since the closed beta and have been around to see many changes to the game and the styles of play. Throughout I've compiled a list of god skin ideas just for fun. I'm mostly a lurker but I played so much yesterday I dreamed about Smite and for some reason couldn't get it out of my head. So I decided to dump them all for you all to critique. 

-**Cupid**
Cupid was the first god I played and eventually got very good at. You wouldn't believe how difficult he was being underpowered with his irritatingly useless ult. Since then he's come a long way, **Heartbreaker Cupid.** Styled after a greaser or maybe the Fonz, he'd sport a slick hairstyle with wicked shades and a sleek leather jacket. Rolling up, blasting people with his heartbomb. It'd be so appropriate... *swoon.*

-**Anubis**
When I decided I'd like to try improving and taking the game a little more seriously I thought Anubis would be the god for that... unfortunately he's one of the least viable gods out there now. I do completely destroy with him in solo queue conquest though. Since I think his Grave Hound is just a bit lacking I got his recolorization with the Nightwalker skin, motherfucking **Scooby-Nubis.** SCOOBY-FUCKING-NUBIS. Nuff said.

-**Agni**
Agni is a scary god, Agni is hard to predict because of his weird dance leap. It's... so long. Which made me think it'd be immensely appropriate if he had a jester skin. **Jester Agni.** I thought Loki might do well with a jester skin but HiRez might want to steer clear of the Shaco knockoff and give the more leapy god his jingle bell hat.

-**Loki**
Speaking of Loki, he assassinates you with a frying pan in one hand and running away with his toque bobbing. Oh happy day, he cooked another feeder.

-**Ymir/Agni**
Ymir is a free god and I honestly don't care how many skins each god has. The game isn't even officially out yet and I imagine many more years for this game to grow and even become quite successful. With that, these are just for fun and I like to imagine a giant flaming ogre who instead of freezing, turns people to a crisp or a huge frozen meteor smashing down... then I remember I don't like Agni and RELEASE THE KRAKEN. (Poseidon players represent!)

-**Fenrir**
Originally the next skin idea that I had was for Anhur, I think it'd be hilarious if Fenrir was running up as **Dog the Bounty Hunter.** Get it? He's a dog? I'm still actually not sure about this one, because I still think Anhur would do better with a safari or outback type skin and for some reason I think bounty hunter and I think Australia.

-**Ne Zha**
I heard rumor that there might be a robo-Anubis in the making


Anyway

-**Xbal**
Ninja Xbalanque

-**Apollo**
Someone had a really great idea for a promotional skin for Apollo that I read sometime ago, so don't quote me on that. Or that.

-**Sun WuKong**
Mojo Jojo.

1367617317.0,1dn7lv,Re-balancing Ares - List of Buffs/Nerfs/Reworks Explained,Booman61,53,19,45,"What I have in mind for Ares involves a LOT of change and reworking


So I've been trying to piece together a way to make Ares a viable *support tank*

- Granting him the ability to peel effectively

- The ability to handle creep waves

- Being a better protector towards his carry

- Making his Ultimate more consistent

- Rewarding the player for being accurate and consistent with abilities


I'm suggesting a small change to Bolster Defenses


I'll start with Bolster Defenses, none of the Nemean Lion nonsense that ignores protections! Bolstered allies reflect 8/11/14/17/20% of basic-attack (post-mitigated) damage and 2/4/6/8/10% of ability-based (post-mitigated) damage back to the attacker as Magical Damage. The player damage should be credited to Ares and Bolster Defenses in the damage report. However I am not a fan of granting ""free damage"" without good player judgement, and would suggest reducing the lifetime of the Bolster Defenses buff to 4 seconds to accompany this reflection change. This means that Ares will have to skillfully time the activation of Bolster Defenses in anticipation of incoming damage in order to mitigate and reflect the best part of it back at the attackers.


I'll go with Shackles next, Shackles does 25/45/65/85/105 (+15%) on hit, and also ticks for the same damage 4 more times over 4 seconds. And that's not including the fact that Ares can fire another 2 chains within 2 seconds of each other for even more hits/ticks... for 0 mana cost. If you focus the same enemy God with all 3 chains, you can get ~12 total ticks of damage over time. In a realistic situation (considering Ares' bonus Magical Power contribution vs enemy carries who generally don't build Magical Protection), Shackles will be hitting for around 90 per tick at Level 5 (and that is a Tank Ares with just a Void Stone contributing). Ticking over 10 times at ~90 per tick... and this is just one ability, potentially dealing over 1000 damage on top of a Cripple/Speed-Leech.

So let's not kid ourselves, and much less about damage (I have Searing Flesh in mind as the primary damage dealer, but we'll get to that move later). So needless to say, I'd start by reducing the damage significantly. I also do not see why this needs to be a DoT. I agree that Shackles can be difficult to land, and Ares is almost useless if he misses the first chain, but I feel that this applies to any move in the game. Sobek doesn't get a second chance if he misses Charge Prey, so I don't feel that Ares should be exempt from this rule. However with this rework

First of all; Damage. I suggest making Shackles deal 50/75/100/125/150 (+50% of Magical Power) on hit. No extra ticks, but building Magical Power items will reward him nicely with the +50% contribution. However with a realistic build, Ares would be dealing around 300-400 damage if he hits all 3 Shackles on an enemy, which is far more acceptable than in it's current state and is still a respectable amount.

The second change to Shackles; Crowd Control. Ares currently has almost no form of peel to protect his partner. He can slow them with Shackles or blow his Ultimate for a chance to Pull/Stun, to break a move like Berserker Barrage, Drain Life, Taolu Assault, Plague of Locusts, Clear the Path etc... channeled moves. I don't want Shackles to actually Silence enemies like Hades can, just a brief interrupt that cancels enemies' channeled abilities. This does not make Hades' Shroud of Darkness inferior

Lastly on Shackles; remove the Cripple. It is unnecessary with all these new alterations in mind


Next up is Searing Flesh! This move is currently pretty awful early game, I had planned to make Searing Flesh a little more powerful vs Gods to compensate, and much better vs Minions.

The idea is to increase the damage of Searing Flesh to 30/35/40/45/50 (15% of Magical Power) per tick, Jungle Creeps and Pets. This change makes Ares more capable vs creep waves, which he desperately needs. It also makes up for a small amount of lost damage from the current Shackles' ticking, without overdoing it and keeping his damage output from being ridiculous. Searing Flesh is now a little stronger than Taolu Assault, but Taolu Assault has more utility as it steals Protections, whereas Searing Flesh is purely intended to be a damage move.


Finally

Firstly; Cooldown. Increase the cooldown on No Escape to 150 seconds. Why should most of the Ultimates in Smite be based around a 90-second cooldown? I look at Ra and Arachne, Searing Pain every 50 seconds. With this in mind, I believe making the cooldown on No Escape higher than average will better represent the tenacity of the Ultimate more, and will put us in a better place to discuss countering the Ultimate.

Secondly; Countering. No Escape is up there with Pillar of Agony as one of the most easily countered moves in the game, No Escape can currently be avoided through Purification Beads, Aegis Amulet, Cleanse and a huge number of Ultimates that grant CC-immunity for their duration (e.g. Searing Pain, Shards of Ice, Death Gaze, Valkyrie's Discretion, Lurking in the Waters

I suggest having an influence from Shackles play a part in No Escape's execution. Here's my proposed change; If Ares casts No Escape on a plain enemy, he is silenced for the 2.5 seconds where Ares is preparing to pull. This means that the Shackled enemy cannot use any abilities, including a Counter-Ult and Aegis Amulet. The only way out from here is to use Purification Beads, a rare CC-breaker (i.e. Kali's Frenzy or Aphrodite's Undying Love) or for Hel to Cleanse you.

The point of this is to reward Ares for Shackling an enemy prior to Pulling, I think you deserve a huge Pull. Simply put, if Ares doesn't make a good effort and just runs in to Ult and pull, nothing changes and he can be easily countered. However if he makes the effort and accurately lands his chains, he is rewarded by cancelling out half of the enemies' counters. Not only does this make No Escape a much more viable move, it becomes a rewarding ability if the players performs it well BUT it is kept in check by being the only Ultimate in the game with a 150-second cooldown.


That's it. It is quite a large amount of reworking but I picture a much

Shackles is no longer a DoT that ticks, any channeled moves (e.g. Berserker Barrage) are interrupted and cut short. Ares can continue to fire up to 2 more chains on a successful hit.

Bolster Defenses' lifetime is reduced to 4 seconds. Allies with the buff now reflect a percentage of damage (post-mitigated) back at the attacker as Magical Damage.

Searing Flesh deals slightly more damage than before

No Escape's cooldown increased to 150 seconds. An enemy who is afflicted by Shackles is Silenced as Ares casts No Escape and cannot use abilities/actives. Players must use Purification Beads


So if you are able to picture this brand new Ares, and do you agree this would be a much more likeable and fair God in casual play?

* Shackles enemies are slowed by 15% for the duration
* Ares has 2 seconds between chains to re-use it before it goes on cooldown
* The Shackle debuff timer starts when this ability goes on cooldown (enemies Shackled beforehand suffer the effects for longer)

1370418540.0,1fpjsx,Should we have that? A shopkeeper,LolaRuns,53,17,40,"Example Game: League http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=atFhEUJaCoo 

Shopkeepers are a long tradition in various MOBAs. It would mostly add a face to the buying process

**Pro**

(A) The shopkeeper could greet the player who is shopping adding additional flavor by using their titles

(B) They could comment on bought items. ""Good choice"" or ""one of my finest items"" or ""this will invigorate you"" (on buying potions for example) or ""You know

(C) When the god has finished shopping the shopkeeper could bid them goodbye and cheer them on (""Go give 'em hell!"")

(D) They could be an excellent candidate for voice packs with different flavors and different types of jokes. Or even skins for the shop keeper (greedy gnome, busty maid, sympathetic old guy, creepy old crone, or just clothes for every pantheon type). 

**(E)** Slightly different but related: when they have finished an item the gods could say the names of the items out loud ( example: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vv6eXuwFCLA )  or even say a line about it's functionality ""I dare them to attack me"" for Hide for example or ""this shall protect me nicely"" for a protective item or ""The jungle is not safe from me"" for Bumba's. Could actually have a learning benefit for people to remember the names of the items.  

**Counter Arguments**

1.) I feel it would be more hard to fit thematically why gods from so many different pantheons would shop at the same person's. There's also that the spawn area of Smite is really exposed compared to other MOBAs

2.) The buying process in Smite feels really streamlined and adding this could make it feel more clunky even if nothing about the process actually changes

3.) It's particularly pointless in Smite compared to the isometric mobas because you just buy from spawn and don't physically walk to a spot/click somewhere to get your items. 

4.) No reason to have it just because many other MOBAs have it/might even be a way distinguish yourself and give yourself a different feel. (though Smite isn't the only one who hasn't one)

5.) Any type of additional voice work probably doesn't come cheap. 

**My overall opinion**: Meh. On one hand I really like the chance for more flavor and/or to get some sort of audio feedback on your buying process. On the other I feel there are valid points against it/it is pretty superfluous. Maybe experiment by putting one into one of the side game modes. Or do the thing where the gods say the names of items first. ",,t5_2stl8,1370418926.0,suggestion,tusky,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/Smite/comments/1fpjsx/should_we_have_that_a_shopkeeper/
1368107923.0,1e01cn,Suggestion: Improving instant cast,vash12788,41,5,23,"In my opinion instant cast is currently in a state where it's okay but still requires you to memorize every single gods ability shapes and ranges. This is my idea for improving it.


[This a general mockup


If the ability is available to cast (off of cooldown) the targeter is visible.

Still show the blue arrow for ranged gods

Remove the yellow coloring in the center of the targeters to make it less obtrusive.

Change the borders for every targeter. Make each ability for every god have a unique border, 2 is blue, 3 is red, and 4 is purple.

I feel like this would make instant cast immensely better and if implemented the other two cast options could probably be removed

**Poseidon


**PASSIVE -** 
Poseidon's attacks cause his Tide mechanic to increase and casting abilities causes it to decease. When he at 0% and 100% his attacks deals 30% extra damage with some scaling amounts in between.

**WATER BLADE -**
Poseidon casts a wave that travels in a line dealing damage + magic power and pushing back all enemies in the path. Reduces Tide by 35.

**TIDAL SURGE -**
Poseidon charges his trident granting additional move speed and making his auto attacking spread out two additional shots which hit for 50% of his physical power

**WHIRLPOOL -**
Poseidon creates a whirlpool that pulls enemies toward the center dealing damage + magic power and also dealing % of their max health every .5s for 4s. Reduces Tide by 30.

The StarCast Podcast
The Strategist StarCraft 2 Show
Several StarCraft 2 Casting Positions

So I have a decent amount of background in the Starcraft 2 e-sports scene
Teamliquids main gaming community is Starcraft 2, but there are a few things that might help jump start the scene even more; One being an event calendar for the WOGL Season 1 Smite Tournament &amp; Community Events.

My recommendation:
I think it would be a good idea for WOGL to setup some type of system on their website for when 2 teams decide on a time and date for their round match in the Match Comm. that you can sync it up with a Public Calendar. So at any time any WOGL/Smite fan can check the calendar for the upcoming matches.  In that same form a spot to put in a link to who is streaming would be excellent! I understand that WOGL is trying to cast/stream as many matches as possible

Requirements to Submit a Calendar Event: http://www.teamliquid.net/forum/viewmessage.php?topic_id=158090
We (the Smite Community) could even take this further for WOGL and people could submit event request, Giveaway Events, Charity Events all listed on one Smite Public Calendar.  It would be amazing to make WOGL the Smite HUB for the e-sports community. (I am in no way affiliated with WOGL)

I don't believe this is something Hi Rez (publisher of Smite) should be handling.  E-Sports grass roots communities are not successful when run by the publishers of the game. For a strong e-sports scene to survive it needs a strong community foundation to make any game a successful e-sport.  Anyways this is just my 2 cents
If this is already in place and I am not aware I do apologize for feeding the trolls.
If someone from WOGL wants help with this project please messages me on twitch

As we all know

Luckily Smite has an awesome built in voice system to help us all communicate. Sadly, there are dozens of commands. What I'd like to do is narrow it down to the essential ones. If you memorise these commands you will perform better, you're team will perform better and you WILL win more. Here is the list of what i believe is essential, in this guide;

1 = LEFT LANE
2 = MIDDLE LANE
3 = RIGHT LANE
G = GOLD FURY
M = MINOTAUR
F = FIRE GIANT

VA 1 2 3 G F M- Attack - This helps tell your lane partner/jungler to initiate on the enemy.

VC 1 2 3 - Be Careful - This tells the respective lane there is possible danger and they should take care.

VD 1 2 3 G F M- Defend - This tells your team mates to defend - for example if a tower will be pushed defend that lane. Or defend the Gold Fury for instance.

VF 1 2 3 - Enemy Missing - This lets your team know your enemy is missing and you have no idea where they are.

VG 1 2 3 - Gank - This tells your jungler or lane partner to gank. Its more for junglers.

VH 1 2 3 - Help - Struggling in lane? you can let your team know you need help. being chased? same again.

VI 1 2 3 - Incoming - You have seen the enemy going in a certain direction? let your team mates know. It will save lives.

VR 1 2 3 - Retreat - Team mates in danger? out of position? tell them to retreat.

VT 1 2 3 - Enemy Returned - your enemy has returned

VVA - OK

VVN - No

VVY - Yes

VVX - Cancel That


There are other commands that are helpful

Its really not that complex

Anyway

If you have any questions please let me know.

1375797307.0,1jt7aw,A potential Mid gold harpy change for the better of the game.,The_Anamull,52,20,33,"This idea is coming from personal experience and is a judgement on the current ""flow"" of the game. I believe the mid lane furies are forcing large

Middle camps are changed from 2 large furies to 1 large fury + 3 small furies. What does this change?
Currently the mid gold (if solo'd) is worth 90 gold and 280 exp
with the changes (if solo'd) it would be worth 84 gold and 206 exp

Reasons why mid will still be contested with changes: it's free gold and exp, the reduction of 74 exp is QUITE significant to make the support tank/ ranged adc/ solo not want to rotate. 

Change number 2. Rotate the mid camps to face Northwest/Southeast. This will make invading the gold camps slightly riskier. Without wards

Benefits: Slightly safer to do the camps, with a narrow escape route this could mean inevitable death. I moved the camps to be a little more towards each side and not directly in the middle.

1373678100.0,1i6yem,[Skill Set] Khepri - God of Rebirth (inspired by the artwork),Florburz,44,11,30,"INSPIRED BY [THIS ARTWORK](http://www.reddit.com/r/Smite/comments/1i6jry/god_concept_khepri_god_of_rebirth/)

I saw this person's god concept for Khepri and I felt like designing a support/tank skill set for the god.  I feel the skills are really unique

**PLEASE: Give feedback about the concept

**Khepri - God of Rebirth**

* Pantheon - Egyptian
* Role - Support/Tank


**Innate - Scavenging**

*Being a scarab

* Walking over creep corpses heals 0.5% of Khepri's health to Khepri and allied gods within a 30 foot AoE

* Walking over the corpse of an enemy god heals an extra 10% of that god's max health

* Creep corpses last for 5 seconds

* Khepri gains a permanent 2 to his protections for every god corpse he walks over.



**(1) Soul Link**

*Khepri sends a beam in a line

* Drains 4/6/8/10/12% movespeed and attackspeed from the target

* Khepri takes 20% reduced damage

* If linked to an ally

* Lasts for 6 seconds when targeting an enemy (10 seconds on allies)


**(2) Scarab Swarm**

*Khepri surrounds himself with a veil of voracious scarabs, the skill's effects end early.*

* Does 8/16/24/32/40 (+5% magic power) magic damage every 0.5 seconds to nearby enemies.  This ability has a passive 60% magic lifesteal (which is reduced to 20% because it is an AoE)

* The scarab swarm can absorb up to 75/150/225/300/375 (+50% magic power) damage for Khepri (calculated after protections)

* Lasts for 4 seconds


**(3) Latch On**

*Khepri latches onto the target enemy or ally.  While on an enemy

* Enemies can be disabled for up to 3/3.5/4/4.5/5 seconds

* Allies gain 60/70/80/90/100% of Khepri's protections and immunity from CC for up to 3/3.5/4/4.5/5 seconds

* Hitting Khepri with a Stun, Taunt, Knock-up, etc will knock him off early (applies to both enemies and allies).

* While Khepri is on an ally

* Scarab Swarm can be cast while using this move.  Soul Link and Resurrection cannot be used.


**(Ult) Resurrection**

*Khepri attempts to revive the targeted ally.  If successful

* As an AoE targeted skill (similar to using Loki's ult or Fenrir's 3), Resurrection goes on cooldown, but the timer is reduced by 50% (100~50 seconds)

* A directly revived ally recovers 100% of their health and mana and is CC immune for 3 seconds

* Any non-targeted allies who are dead have their respawn timer reduced by 60/65/70/75/80% (of its current value).  This is also the effect if used while dead.

* 200/175/150/125/100 second cooldown.  If this ability is interrupted early in any way

Again

**Changelog:**

*7/13: Increased Scavenging permanent buff per stack from 1 to 2.

* 7/12: Extended duration of Soul Link to 10 seconds for allies.  Soul link now causes Khepri to take 20% of damage instead of the linked ally.

1372613993.0,1hdgva,"Gold Skin ""System"" Idea",HazzeDesigns,39,9,40,"Hello guys

Idea:

Once reached Mastery Level 1 on a God and the gold skin is purchased after every NEXT mastery level you gain an additional color to choose for the gold skin.

Example:

- Mastery level 2 = Green
- Mastery level 3 = Orange
- Mastery level 4 = Brown
- Mastery level 5 = White
- Mastery level 6 = Yellow
- Mastery level 7 = Purple
- Mastery level 8 = Grey
- Mastery level 9 = Red
- Mastery level 10 = Black

Once reached the mastery level you can choose the color you want to use for the match.

This would make the gods more customizable for the players.

1367731059.0,1dpw8e,Smurfing Etiquette,cheif039,35,5,27,"So I recently started a second account to play with a few friends from college and teach them the game and I figure I might as well give advice to the rest of my team as I go and see what I can do to help the enemy team in the lobby afterwords.

With most Moba communities giving smurfs a bad name I was wondering if we as a community could come up with some ""guidelines"" or etiquette for how to level through the lower lowers without hurting those new to the community and diminishing our potential player base.

So far I can think of:

1. **Be conscious of the fact these are new players**
   -These players can't be treated like they should know every god let alone even one god. These players are still new to the game and item builds might not be perfect.

2. **Try to help the new players**
   -Several times I've been asked how to do x or how didn't i die to y. Make sure to take the time to explain when you get the chance. Teaching them at lower levels will help to strengthen play at the higher levels. This also pertains to item builds

3. **Be aware that the enemy team is also new**
   -If you can its probably best to try to play gods you don't know or play so well. This can be a great opportunity for both you and the new players to learn without blowing the enemy out of the water. Its important to remember there are 9 new players in a conquest game not just the 4 on your team and we would like to keep all of them interested in the game.

4. **Use and teach the VGS system.**
   -Far to often in low level games do I see people still typing in things like mias and even more often than that not knowing to call mias. Teaching someone the VGS system and when to use it can help them improve not only their play but the entire teams.

5. **Remember it is just a game.**
   -You are going to have people who rage

1361301192.0,18u0up,[MOD] THE BIG OL' YOU NEED TO READ THIS POST,LOWPOLYGOD,42,7,21,"Hello everyone! I'm LowPolyGod your new Lead Moderator here on /r/Smite. Sockless brought me in after stepping down as I manage one of the other popular MOBA reddits as well. Lots of things have been changing behind the scenes and will continue to change (hopefully for the better) over the coming weeks. The following are a few key points I want to touch base on:

1. **New Theme** — You should have noticed by now that the theme changed about a week ago. This is the new/minimal/less graphical theme here on /r/Smite. Sockless was working on this

2. **Updated Sidebar Information** — The MOTD

3. **Play For Free Referral Link** — We're running a test with the ""Play For Free"" button in the sidebar. It's currently using Sockless' referral link as a test for two reasons. One

4. **Rules** — We've quickly revised the rules once since I've stepped in

5. Be respectful, No URL shortened links, No submissions where titles are the post, No images without blacked out names are being removed from the sidebar. Most of these are common sense and f all the offending posts I've reviewed none of these rules really come into play and they don't need to eat up sidebar space to drive the point home. (note: that your posts may still be removed for some of these reasons if it warrants it such as listing HiRezTodd's home address or something along those lines).

6. **Streams** — Do not link directly to your stream. You can post your stream once per day if you feel it's worth it to you to do so, a brief description of who you are, what you play, and what kind of commentary will be discussed on the stream.

7. **Weekly Web Series** — As the rules stand now a WWS can make a single post promoting the show and then it goes in the sidebar. From this point on it's going to be a bit different. Each week you can make a post promoting your show, the time it will air, and a link to the show. The sidebar will be updated as needed according to these posts.

8. **Weekly/Monthly Tournaments** — The same thing applies to this as is does to the WWS above. Create a self post promoting your tournament detailing what teams will be involved, link to the stream, and link to the websites / brackets.

9. **Wiki / FAQ / Guides** — We would like to flesh out all of these areas. We'll be allowing anyone to edit the global FAQ located in the sidebar. If you do so, Dota 2 to Smite Guide"" please message the moderators and we'll set it up for you and link it in place. Doing any of the above will put you in running for the Member of the Month and prizes such as gems, skins, or giveaways.

10. **Member of the Month** — Contributing to /r/Smite via creating content for the FAQs, or Comments will put you in the running for the member of the month. Each month the moderators will determine the winner. The winner will have their referrals link used in the sidebar allowing them to earn a small in game reward as well as; some type of skin or gem code for Smite. 

11. **Reporting Posts / Users** — We can only do so much. If you see a post you think violates the rules. Report it. See a user that is constantly toxic to the community? Report them. If you do report them send us a quick message so we know what's going on. We may not see what you see or if they get downvoted enough we way not see them at all. Help us by policing yourselves. If you don't see the [TAG] after the post that probably means a moderator hasn't seen the post yet.

12. **Looking for Team / More Posts** — We're working on a nice workaround for this. Until then we're allowing Look for Team posts to be made on /r/Smite. They will be amended with the [LFTeam] tags by the moderators. A LFMore post will be made daily by a moderator. Any informal LF posts should be made inside of this thread to find people to play with for the day.

13. **Vote Cheating** — A Reddit Admin has been making his rounds in the larger MOBA reddits condemning vote cheating. Which is the practice of manipulating votes via multiple accounts, and a few other measures. This is a growing epidemic on Reddit and they are cracking down on it hard. If you're doing this please stop. You can view the posts on the Dota 2 and League of Legends Reddits. This is TL:DR version quoted directly from the Reddit Admin ""Vote cheating and manipulation of all types(as defined above) is becoming more prevalent in e-sports related subreddits. If you're doing this, stop now.""

14. **Team Flair** — Flair is getting revised soon. Team Flair will only be available if you finish in the top 5 in the Curse or MyRevenge tournaments. We'll use images we see fit to create the flair - if you're not a top 5 team don't bother asking for flair for your organization.

We'll be monitoring these changes to see how they are handled. If you have a problem with a certain type of post please report it. If you need to discuss something with us please use the ""message the moderators"" link in the sidebar. If everything goes well we'll see you guys at the end of the month for the monthly recap.",,t5_2stl8,1361301589.0,,mod,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/Smite/comments/18u0up/mod_the_big_ol_you_need_to_read_this_post/

1363475965.0,1afnrx,Current SMITE Tournaments crippling the competitive scene for Europe?,Resterian,48,16,70,"[Possible jackass response detected: 'Team complaining they lost a tournament trollface.jpg'] 
No. Not at all. In fact
No EU team has won for weeks.

Why is this the case? Are NA teams simply 'better'?

That's highly debatable

But they don't strictly 'Win'. We as EU competitors can sometimes pull off a 3rd or 4th place

All anyone sees is ROOT or Curse scoring first place wins every week. Are they the best? They're good teams, we can't know.

Why?

Because every time they're against a competitive EU team

*""We havent had an EU server against any top NA team in any Curse tourney.""* - Sprayarn

*""It's just such a joke that NA teams get favoured so much at the moment""* - Dradow

*""I can't recall the last time I saw an EU team at the top of any tournament bracket""* - Vastrakal

The way I see it, more importantly, those American Teams face far greater odds of performing well and getting the motivation needed to persevere compared to European Teams.

I see newly-formed European Teams take a shot at a Curse or MyRevenge tournament and two things happen;

One. As bottom seed they are placed against ROOT or Curse

Two. They're never heard from again.

And why should they come back? What is the point in even trying if new EU teams are set up only to fail due to impossible obstacles.

In a nut shell

I recall in the past in the early days of SMITE when you couldn't pick regions, blame their losses on lag.

However
And why would NA teams care? They're not in our position most of the time.

*""In all honesty I don't really pay attention to it.""* - Stermes

I suppose I wouldn't really expect them to be all that interested

The point I'm trying to make I guess, it's near impossible for an EU team to do well or even win.

I'd like to see region-based tournaments but sadly, don't even reach double digits.

1.  **Do not Cherry Pick.**  Do not go to your favorite god and read my change for him/her without reading the rest.  The changes are supposed to work in tandem to each other

2.  I don't like nerfing.  Nerfing is generally taking away something that makes a character fun.  So, some things need to be toned down, so I will address the major points.

(I have items to do

    Map Changes!!

**Fire Giant:**
&gt;Fire Giant's placement and hitbox are moved up 10 feet.  Start up time on overhand smash increased by 18 frames.  (.3 seconds)

The movement does two things.  First, itself.  First, more options of escape.  Two, AoE effects can't be used to burn players down near the unpulled Fire Giant, which makes Shielded Recall on that lane's players a more viable option when trying to escape in the jungle!  

The overhand smash was changed to allow gods to avoid the knockup damage and cc.  Gods lwith jumps may avoid

**Gold Fury**
&gt;Players tanking the Gold Fury will have their protections reduced by 20

It's a bit too easy for certain bruisers

**Minotaur**
&gt;Minotaur will only regain 15% of his HP upon reaching his center station

Stupid chain resets lololololo.


    Mechanics:

**Deminishing Returns:**
&gt;Upon third application of a CC of the same type (Stun, silence, etc) within 6 seconds, the duration will be reduced to 50%.  That player will then be immune to that CC type for 6 seconds.  (This does not effect slow mechanics)

Too.  Many.  Stuns.  Fenrir jumps in, Ragnarok pull's back into a Ymir...  The simple idea of DR should address this issue easily, and effectively, while keeping the core mechanics of teamfights intact.

**Basic Attack**
&gt;Mages now incur half the normal basic attack movement speed loss as tanks and physical Gods.  This does not apply to gods whose basic attacks scale with magic power

As of now, and cost players lives, and sometimes games.  With this change, you'll be able to have a bit more control, and a tad bit more damage.

1364240082.0,1azpgh,God Idea: Zhong Kui - Chinese Vanquisher of Ghosts and Evil.,mBlakew,36,5,34,"Was brushing up on my mythology and ran across this guy. Figured Smite is due for another Chinese God.

Zhong Kui is the vanquisher of ghosts and evil beings. He commands demons. His role in the Chinese mythology is to hunt

Here's my attempt to make him viable in Smite. Suggestions welcome!

Zhong Kui would be a melee role. Maybe bruiser / support?

His whole story / role is the pursuit of evil / vanquishing evil. Thus he kit includes a plethora of slows in varying degrees to help his pursuit. This may lean him more towards the support role than physical carry. 

Passive - After killing a minion the minion is resurrected as a ghost under the command of Zhong Kui. This can occur more than once every 15/25 seconds. Minions health / damage scale with game duration. Not applicable on Fire Giant / Gold Fury. Max of 4 minions OR minions last 10 seconds / until killed.

OR 

Passive - Killing a minion or enemy god grants Zhong Kui an apparition charge in his soul well. These apparitions enhance his abilities to do more damage / added effects OR are required to active his abilities.

Ability 1 - Ghost Wave - Zhong Kui summons a wave of apparitions from Hell to damage enemies in a circle around him

Ability 2 - Ghastly Sacrifice - Zhong Kui minions swarm around him. Anyone who hits Zhong Kui while Ghastly Armor is active is slowed by % for 1/1/2/2/3 seconds. A portion of the damage dealt to Zhong Kui is dealt back to attacking enemies.

Ability 3 - Blades of Hell - Zhong Kui summons two ghastly blades to attack his foes. Blades act independently of one another and can attack different foes. Each blades does X damage + a % of his physical power and slightly slowing enemies hit by %. Lasts 2/3/3/4/4 seconds.

OR

Ability 3 - Blade of Judgement - Zhong Kui lashes out in a cone dealing X damage to enemies and slowing them by % for 1/1/2/2/3 seconds. (Maybe corrupt the soil in front of him?)

Ability 4 - Hell's Judgement - The soil around Zhong Kui becomes one with Hell

This is really the first time I've sat down and thought a God out. Let me know what you think. 

Figured it would be fun to detail the changes of the God based on player feedback.

Edit 1: Changed passive to include a cap on minions / possibility of 10 sec duration. Reduced occurring duration from 20/30 to 15/25.

Edit 2: Reduced slow duration on Ability one. From 2/3/4/5/6 to 2/2/3/3/4

Edit 3: Added slight slow to Blades of Hell.

Edit 4: Changed name of Ability 4. From Ghosts of Hell to Fields of Hell.

Edit 5: Added possibility of bruiser support god increase of melee dmg god. 

Edit 6: Added an alternative passive that utilizes a ""soul well"". Did not change abilities to reflect this passive.

Edit 7: Changed Ability One from a straight line to a circle effect around him. Changed Ability two to have a slow when hit by enemies / reworked it to be more in line with his overall kit. Added a possible Ability 3. Changed name of Ability 4 to fit lore more closely.

1375803036.0,1jte04,An open discussion on age and competitive gaming.,HiRezKelly,43,15,104,"Hello SMITE Redditors!

Seeing as how the last ""Open Discussion"" topic I posted had a lot of feedback (and I loved reading all of it) I'd like to bring up another point of discussion. **Warning: semi-long post again**

Myself and a few others from Hi-Rez Studios recently went to QuakeCon where we partnered up with Alienware and had a booth for some casual tournaments and walk up play. During this weekend a decent amount of fans from Smite would walk up and talk with us

It BLEW my mind that there were so many young SMITE fans that took the game rather seriously. When I was that age the only game I ever took relatively seriously was Soul Calibur 2 and Dance Dance Revolution (*yes

So that brings me to my main point of discussion...

**How does age impact the quality and quantity of competitive gaming?**

Do you think that age is no longer as restrictive as it once was? Do you feel that those that are younger are simply not as good as older competitors or vice versa? Or has gaming simply became a more accepted community in the general public to allow their children to focus on it as a **sport/hobby**?

When I was interning at a high school to become a teacher (*yes

I was so confused but delighted that there was someone that was actively wanting to ""Grow up and be a professional gamer"" to the point that they'd write a publicly posted paper about it. Never in my years of high school did I ever see anyone post anything like that.

**I'd love to hear every ones opinions and stories of how age affected them in the Gaming scene.**

A pearl start as a grain of sand in a mussel which is then built upon, fully formed. It is unwavering

Finally, the value which our clan has taken as its namesake, conveys passion, fervor, and desire. It inspires our members to be enthusiastic about gaming and the clan, to be diligent in their endeavors, and to allow their inner fires to shine through, which serves as a powerful statement, and zeal.

1368828720.0,1ejm5s,"Can we please get player names ""released"" from inactive accounts?",asylumsaint,44,18,52,"Hello!

I had recently tried contacting HiRez about this issue.  What issue you might ask?  Plenty of names are locked to peoples accounts who haven't played more then 1 game in over a year.  Why is this problem?  Some people much like myself, and a reputation with the name. It makes it extremely annoying.

Assuming, while being fair.

Players under level 5, 6-8months.  Probably don't plan on returning anytime soon.  (While I can't speak for all of them, we can assume many of them won't)  Some may be waiting for release.

I feel that, and hasnt played in 6-8 months.  Their names should be ""released"" should a current and active player request it.

This practice isnt something new.  It's been done by a just about every single MMO (WoW

This idea not only helps players like myself who are stuck using a different name

This also generates money for HiRez. 

In theory, and say, 5 out of every 10 players who dont have their name, are lost to inactive accounts,  if all those players were to buy 400 gems for the name change, thats a good chunk of the total player base buying gems for the name change.

For me

It makes more sense to me, then to gamble with the chances of a returning inactive player.

What are your guys thoughts on this?

Example:

This was from when I played World of Warcraft, to request names to be unlocked.

EDIT:  Ok

So apparently I need to clarify this since many people do not understand.

Trueskill tracks two numbers, the more games you play, the more certain the system becomes of your average skill actually being μ.

If you win, it only goes down with every game played. That is to say, your rating may fluctuate, but the system becomes more and more certain of your rating with every game you play.

[Source material from Microsoft](http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/projects/trueskill/) - basically what I've rewritten in my own words above, but that's the basics to their matchmaking system.

**ADDENDUM: MY THEORY**

I believe this is the reason you see that gamer with a low amount of games played matched up with/against another gamer with a high amount of games played. The system thinks they have the same skill (the same μ), the more likely it is that someone with high uncertainty (σ) gets dropped in with someone with low uncertainty (σ), because the system puts priority on matching a similar skill (μ) first, when it has to.

on today's menu: Item Cost -&gt; Benefit

=================================================

**A Brief Overview**

=================================================

* I will be referring to item upgrades as Tiers (total of 3 tiers) - T1, L2, L3.

* The new item from the last patch has not yet been added into this pool.

* All costs will be referred to as total cost unless noted otherwise. This means that if I say T2 = 1000g, T3 1900)

* The average cost of a T1 item is 741. Low - 420g Magi's Blessing. High - 1010g for Book of Thoth.

* Weight refers to the stats allocated to a particular item - This helps for more direct comparisons because we can simplify the classes to certain stats.

=================================================

Link to Google Docs: [SMITE Item Averages](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AvFUbNYB513mdDY0ckwtTU5SOGVGYnlhUnVrQWJLbGc)

If you see an error in the Items sheet

=================================================

**In a Nutshell... (tl;dr)**

=================================================

* You pay *LESS* for a T2 than a T1. This means that the more T1 items you have

* You pay *MORE* for a T3 than a T1 or T2 (unless it has no passive).

* The game intends to reward you for fully upgrading an item (items without passives are less expensive than T1 or T2

* The stats on these items compared to their gold costs (on average) are somewhat justified. Some items give way too much of a stat comparatively (example: Reinforced boots give the absolute most HP5) If I can ever figure out how to do conditional formatting on Google Docs I could make it easier to see visually.

* The item design is not good for this genre. Builds are stagnant and the attempt to use Ability items to fill the void between expensive upgrades and mid game itemization is not sufficient.

* Unrelated but worth saying: Girdle of Might (Ability) is terrible in its current form.

* Sorry in advance if some parts of this don't make sense... Just ask a question and I'll clarify it. It's a long post and I wasn't able to get to everything in one sitting.

=================================================

**The Analysis**

=================================================

There are a few patterns we can identify in this data almost immediately

* You pay *LESS* for a T2 than a T1. This means that the more T1 items you have, a Book of Thoth (which has no passive @ T3) costs 1010g T1, 1970 T2. This item provides Mana (25&gt;75), Magical Power (30/65), and Mana regen (5&gt;10). You gain significantly more mana at T2 and 5 extra MP and pay 50 less gold for the T2 upgrade than the initial T1 purchase. This is a moderate example, but clearly shows the case for all T1&gt;T2 purchases.

* You pay *MORE* for a T3 than a T1 or T2 (unless it has no passive). A lot of other people have made the argument that the passive @ T3 makes it necessary to fully upgrade an item before making another purchase and I'm not really here to tell you any different. You should take the overall average with a grain of salt, you pay 2423 (or upgrade from T3 for 969) on average for a T3 item.

What does this mean? Well, item builds are very dynamic and necessary to change and adapt to the game. There are no active items in SMITE (Ability items do not apply in this conversation because their functionality / weight are different. They are basically LoL summoner spells that you can buy and mix up each game), so balancing comes down to novel/utility vs flat stat increases.

**Is it balanced, then yes, it's fairly balanced when you consider the resources necessary to complete an item. Some items are significantly better at a particular stat but cost is generally higher because they mix in below average other stats (except for Reinforced Boots which is waaaay too much HP5 or too cheap). But this isn't what I wanted to pose as a problem. I understand that items can always find unintended and wildly successful uses (re: Mystical Mark stacking in the early game), and nerfing those uses / tweaking stats can be challenging with more and more novel uses (*cough* I really hope they adjust Gem of Isolation and Frostbound Hammer). It's possible to get an idea of their item budget for each stat and how they picked their gold costs, but the intent of this post isn't to number crunch but rather to examine the design.

**Is it good design?** No. Well

=================================================

**The Main Point**

=================================================

Part of the problem can be attributed to just not having enough items in the game. In fact

We get 1500 gold at the start of each game - this is enough for T2 boots + potions, that way they can have on-use items or just simply their LoL style Summoner Spells. If that was the design intent, they failed to create the items around it in a way that would make ability items attractive at the start.

In DOTA(2), but is still food for thought. SMITE took a different approach by borrowing the shop idea from Rise of the Immortals and using League of Legends for designing the stats. Instead of making any item for the early game, all items are meant to start of as 'early game' and then upgrade up into the rest of the match.

In LoL, Hextech Revolver, etc). They put in some items that you cannot upgrade at all and must sell (Doran's + a small handful of low cost high utility, Chalice (before Athene's was added), Haunting Guise, etc) to get better items later on. Arguably, the only item worth selling back is Midas' Boots in SMITE. The boots offer no combat utility and the only stats on them are nearly insignificant.

**But why does this mean it's bad design?** Because once you buy a T1 item you are essentially stuck with it. The Cost -&gt; Benefit of T1 items vs T2 is clear. The most dynamic builds you can do are simply responses to what your opponents are building / who on the team will give you the most trouble. There are no temporary quick-fix items to help you if you're playing a squishy carry and you find yourself in need of some HP and damage quickly. If you have more than 2x T1 items by the 5 minute mark you are basically wasting gold that would get you to a T3 passive. If you have more than 2x T2 at any point you are simply wasting gold by not completing one of them to T3 first. The attempt to fill the void of mid-game utility items with Ability items is rough - Aegis and Purity beads are common mid purchases but are situational. I don't think T2 passives are the right way to address this

Some items need to be nerfed hard because of their utility/stats being too useful/high (Reinforced Boots tops the list for stat to gold nerf when compared to all other items of its class). Some items need to be buffed because of underuse (read: they're not useful). But more importantly,False,,t5_2stl8,1342336907.0,,sobek,t3_wkayr

1373179386.0,1hsisl,Details about what happened during the showmatch at RTX. All opinions are my own.,davidsee,37,9,55,"Album from today here: http://imgur.com/a/zNwWR

Hey all

Second

You probably didn't see this on stream but the DCs that you guys saw weren't actually DCs - the entire showmatch was riddled with technical difficulties from the beginning due to the computers that they were running. The match was played on the new Razer Blade 14 laptops which weren't equipped to handle an event of this nature. Razer was a premier sponsor for RTX so HiRez had no say in what equipment was being used on the main stage during the match. 

The Blade 14 is a sexy ass laptop - even I'll admit that. However, the players' own monitor, as well as a third video capture feed for the stream/projector. Even for LoL, we provide Aurora desktops to maintain the level of performance expected of a professional match like this where $$$$ is on the line. Again though, I don't believe HiRez had a say in this. 

If you look at my album of photos from earlier today

Throughout the match, the issues with ShadowQ and Shing getting stuck on the Windows 8 activation screen. Like I said, it was really tough to see the guys getting thrown off like this and the winner could have gone either way with a single poorly-timed crash. Unfortunately in this case, it happened to Omega at the start of match 3. His crash was the worst of the bunch as his entire system essentially locked up due to thermal throttling and actually did a full 90º screen rotation for some reason. It was honestly a crappy way to win and I wouldn't wish that experience on anyone in a match like this.

To those using this as an example for the need for pause - again it wouldn't have made a difference here. Even with pause, it would have only continued to feature the hardware problems that plagued the showmatch.

Just my two cents here on the event. RTX was a big boost for Smite in my opinion and I hope it helps them take another step in growing the game. 

Looking forward to the NA tournament next weekend where these guys should be back in their usual setups without the hiccups.

Besides playing SMITE which he coincidentally works for

And I kinda guess that most of you don't speak it

- HiRez is thinking about what you can spend your favor on. One of the ideas could be exclusive Skin-packs

- Every god will have a goldskin.

- In future patches a lot of items will have a expanded tier 3 setting. You can see it right now for Ankh of the bear which was included accidently in the last patch. It wasn't on purpose

- It's not a priority right now

- After the games release there will still be new gods on a biweekly basis.

- The game will be translated in different languages, Spanish and so on)

- The elo system is getting reworked constantly and as of now you will probably keep your Elo when game is out of beta. But they are not sure on it and might do a poll in that regard.

- Level 30 is the highest level. You can now get Mastery Level.

- After release the maps will have different themes

- Bumba's Mask stays in the game. It will get reworked until we are satisfied with it.

- Since the last patch you are able to copy + paste stuff.

-  The game will be free of charge forever.

I wished to create this message to bring an issue that much people have noticed to the attention of the developers. However, especially to avoid being mis-understood : I'm highly impressed by Hi Rez's capacity of creating new gods and new content in such short timespan, and of listening to the community on several different matters. It's not always an easy thing for developers, especially since feedbacks are often opposed to each other.

However, but fixing glitches is just as important, and with recent content, there has been an increasing number of bugs, that haven't been fully fixed and that stack up.

Of course, that no-one talked about, despite their presence. Thus the reason of this post.

As for the glitches, and overall I haven't noted them all of course, so please feel free to contribute to this post if you have some to point out, although the goal is not to make a list of bugs.

Some really ""old"" bugs are still present

Some other ""new"" glitches are also present, more and more lag issues (rubber banding, even with low ping, making you teleport on very short distances when you strafe quickly), the aegis delay that many people noticed a few weeks ago, given the feedback I had on my post about this, that has still not be resolved

Other more weird bugs, without having the long animation for the leap, making it faster.

Overall, and focus fully on totally fixing all these issues. They are stacking up more and more, which honestly makes me slightly afraid for Smite's future, as I know how this can quickly escalate, being a developer myself.

Please, as examples.

**Dark Theme Revisions and Light Theme** — The Dark theme has undergone quite a few revisions making it 100% compatible with Reddit Enchantment Suite

**Flair** — You asked for it and we listened (hard to believe right?) You can select flair on sidebar near the very top just under the subscribe/unsubscribe button. You can select from your choice of god, but after that you might have to deal with harsher consequences.***

***Update:*** *Team Flair has been added - go support your favorite team! Let me know if I've missed any major teams.*

**Mode of the Day** — The current mode of the day is now displayed to the right. This should be updated each morning.

**Free Week Gods** — The 5 permanent and 5 temporary free week gods are now displayed in the ""This Week In Smite"" area of the sidebar. These should be updated every patch to keep everyone informed of which gods are currently free.

**Reddit Enhancement Suite** — I wanted to touch base on this again

**In the future...** we'll be adding even more great features. We're currently looking at ways to allow streamers to post their streams daily without cluttering up the frontpage of /r/Smite. We're also in the early stages of creating a LFG/LFM/LFT tool which any Redditor can use to find a group when needed. With the introduction of the new Reddit Wiki System we'll also be creating our own gods database here on Reddit which you can easily link to

*Game Mechanics (will be implemented)-
At what rate does Hades pull someone with ult? How much does 100 physical and/or magical protection protect me against? General questions people may have that really dont have a ""place to get all the answers""

*Fan section (soon after release
Art contests

*Personal Section (will be implemented)-
I love creating items/abilities/""Gods"", ""feel"", sound, the whole nine yards

*Stat Page (soon after release
Another place to go to look at stats. This however is pending how I can gain this information (havent looked into this quite yet).

I still think the game is amazing and addictive

I feel each god should be built around a specific method of playstyle and there should be another god out there that can counter this god's playstyle. For example, but requires a stationary target. What this means is that Anubis absolutely needs to face Gods which have more AoE+low dmg than gods that do high single target damage. They need to be balanced this way. But gods like Poseidon are too hybrid - high mobility, high single target damage, high CC and high AoE. He's not built for a specific purpose and is instead all encompassing. 

Take Odin for example. He's meant to be more for utility, but as anyone who's played Odin will know, people can come often come out unscathed after a full 4sec in the ultimate. He was meant to aid other players to land their hits or protect them. If he went up against Zeus, Zeus could just keep landing charges and can use his own ult to counter Odin's ult. Both of their ults should be used in the right place at the right time. Or else they're going to be wasted. NOW compare this to Tyr, who can knockback, heal, damage and has an AoE, jump ulti that does nasty damage. All while maintaining a good amount of HP and being a jungler if necessary. He does not have a counter/anti-Tyr to him. 

Now take a solo laner for example. Vulcan is someone who can defend towers damn well (thank you boatmurdered for an awesome guide) and can dish out damage to most dumb players. But there is a clear downside to him. The placed turrets destroy minions and peel enemy gods who try to be daring and come close. But once your turrets are placed, quickly throw a monkey to close the gap and start getting hits. But if he misses his jump or monkey, he'll take a beating from Volcanic Overdrive and Backfire. He can't do shit for melee attacks once he's in the Overdrive Thumper's range because of its slow. Now compare it to Fenrir. Missed his jump (which can stun)? Lol, let me use Brutalize then. Fuck, did he still get away. No problem, let me fetch him with my ult. The kit is just too damn diverse. Fenrir can't be built for monster damage AND monster mobility. He should either be high damage-low mobility or vice versa. 

My point is, regardless of your ultimate. But if you're Apollo or Fenrir or Tyr or Chang'e? Their ultimates will help them escape AND deal a ton of damage if necessary.

- **No Fluff** - This is for people who enjoy the more serious side of the game. It focuses on discussion and theorycrafting. This filter hides artwork, misc, help, and suggestions.

- **News** - This filter will only show you announcements

- **Competitive** - E-Sports! E-Sports! E-Sports!

- **All Media** - This filter will only show you artwork

- **No Media** - Works the opposite of ""All Media"". This filter will show you the default listings minus artwork

- **Improvements** - This filter is for people who want to help Hi-Rez improve the game

*If you have a suggestion for a new filter

**Edit: Filters work with both the light and dark themes now. No more switching to light them when clicking them!**

##Team Flair

CtrlAltDefeated has updated the team flairs. Enjoy! We're sticking with the top 5 NA / EU teams per the E-Sports website for the moment.

##Sticky Posts

Sticky Posts should now be easily identifiable and fall more inline with the overall theme for all posts. We're also toying with the idea of allowing posters to assign their own link flair (we'll see).

##Newest God Added to Header

Something I'm playing around with. I've added the newest god to the header of /r/Smite. I'm not sure he's staying yet

**THIS SHOULD ALSO FREE UP MORE VETERANS FROM THE TOURNAMENT THIS WEEKEND.**

————————————————————————————————————————————————

**Play-A-PUG / Demigod Challenge**

**What?**

Series of events in order to generate interest in competitive / high level Smite. Taking part in these weekly PUGs will allow you to take part in the Demigod Challenge.

**Who?**

Anyone. Yes, mediocre players... we want you all to take part in this event.

**When?**

Saturdays at 9PM EST (starting ~~September 15

**Where?**

/r/Smite Play-A-Pug Mumble (donated by tordana)

**Why?**

Why not? You enjoy this game? You want to see it do well? You want to see the competitive scene grow? That's going to take the effort of everyone. *Veterans:* We need players who have a firm grasp on the game - even if you just have one role or lane nailed down. *Non-Veterans:* Think you still have something to learn. Then sign up! We'll match you with veteran players to help you improve inside of the game.

**So what now?**

This is only going to succeed if everyone wants it to. We'll be matching two veteran players with three non-veterans. We'll then match you up against another team. Play as many games as you like, so we'll mix and match the players just like our regular Play-A-PUG games. This will give everyone a fair shot a competitive play. Why take part in it if you're a veteran player? Wouldn't you like to have more competitive teams to play against? Don't you want to help build the community...? Then sign up and help us teach more players about the game, the meta, and high level play! You might just find some hidden talent somewhere in the mix...

**To sign up for our first Play-A-PUG event leave a comment below with your in-game name, or noob), and preferred role / lane. We'll slot you into teams with similar interest, match you against a team, send you the game / password, and mumble information. All you have to do is show up!**

http://pastebin.com/cvPC7r2h



Hello
I've been streaming TF2 and other games for over a year now
I may end up making this in to a video

Recently I've noticed a large amount of Smite streamers showing up and/or people who want to stream smite who don't know how.
A lot of newer streamers
I don't claim to be an amazing streamer who everyone should aspire to be

First of all
There used to be a program called Xsplit
Right now

http://obsproject.com/

This tutorial will proceed assuming you're using OBS. Although a little headwork and clicking around will translate it to Xsplit easily.

Next we want to set it up.
Before you do anything

You need to keep in mind that streaming is VERY heavy on your Internet
Use http://www.speedtest.net/ to determine your upload speed. I'd personally recommend having 5mb/s or more
This becomes important soon

Next you want to click the settings tab at the top
You will be greeted by what appears a simple little menu... But then you want to click ""Encoding"".
This where your upload speed becomes important. It determines the bitrate (Basically overall quality) that you can stream at.

I have a 16mb/s upload and stream at 8000 bitrate
Frankly

Next click Broadcast settings. This is the part that will typically throw people off.

Mode: Live Stream

Streaming Service: Twitch/Justin.tv (Assuming you're using Twitch

Server: Whatever is closest to you. For some reason I'm using US west which is stupid because I'm English... Let me fix that real quick....

Stream key: To get this
The rest is personal preference.

I stream in 720p
This is highly dependent on both your Internet and your computer speed.
The actual resolution you can stream at depends on your CPU speed (I use an AMD 8350 at 4.5ghz).
However

Later
TESTING YOUR STREAM IS VERY IMPORTANT. PLEASE MAKE SURE YOU DO THIS

Next go to audio... This is all very self explanitory. Moving on.

Advanced: This tab isn't as important as the name suggests. Personally I've never changed anything and I leave it all default.


OKAY! So now we have OBS all set up and stream ready

Start by right clicking in Scenes
Now select your scene and click add and choose Game Capture.

Make sure Smite is running
On select application
Now make sure you check ""Stretch image to screen"" and ""Ignore aspect ratio"". This allows for more flexibility
in in the same format you're streaming (4:3 or 16:9) then it won't take away from the quality.
Then selecting Capture mouse cursor is purely optional. Keep in mind that when you're in game
Now click ""Ok"" and click ""Preview stream"". BOOM

Now you can add customisation. You can add logos and such

You can find my overlay template here: http://www.reddit.com/r/Smite/comments/1guzkx/stream_overlay_template/

Using a webcam is always a nice touch


-- From here onwards can also apply to people who already knew how to stream

Okay so now we have everything set up and you're ready to stream. Hitting ""Start Stream"" will make you go live and everyone in the world can watch! ... Assuming you set it up correctly.
BUT WE'RE NOT DONE YET. Now comes the part that really bothers me when I watch new streamers
The microphone volume in comparison to the game volume. You will NOW want to start running tests.

Spending about half an hour on tests is very important
You want to change your resolution until you find something comfortable
big thing about streams

Okay so now you've finished running tests and you are TECHNICALLY ready to begin streaming.
But just a couple of little nitpicks now.

Make sure you have configured your Twitch page to have a catchy title
Then make a nice banner/background. Of course that us purely optional


So that's basically it. You are now ready to start streaming and meeting nice viewers! Have fun in streaming!


Disclaimer: Again I would like to make it PAINFULLY clear that I'm not pretending to be a successful/entertaining/amazing streamer who everyone should love. I am however trying to make a comprehensive guide for how to stream Smite.
Googling ""How to stream Smite"" brings up nothing for me

Thanks for reading
Also ask any questions you have relating to troubleshooting etc

Ares is one of my favourites, the tables turn and he's not comfortable at all and is totally situational. Here are a few advantages of playing him:

1) Excellent Aegis/Beads burner especially now you can blink ultimate with him - This allows your carries to focus down the enemy players with no actives left. 

2) Chains - You can absolutely melt any carry with no magical protection if you can combo 3 chains together

Consider these disadvantages:

1) He has absolutely NO pushing power. You can auto attack and searing flesh the wave but by the time it's dead the next full wave will be almost arriving. If you buy mystical mark it helps but that's a very expensive third item and useless if the enemy is magic heavy.

2) If you miss your first chain - what then? You're about as useful as a ham sandwich at a Barmitzvah. You have nothing to do beside bolster defenses and hope your carry does work.

3) He's very easily countered by CC such as Hades/Ymir who can interrupt his chain combo. Not to mention if the enemy team has an odin they can focus you down very easily.

4) In all of this

So what can be done?

I'm not sure how HiRez feel about Ares but in my opinion he definitely needs something changing,False,,t5_2stl8,False,,poseidon,t3_1d9psv

Let me start off by explaining how I came to think of this. I was playing a game of conquest, was doing bad. The entire enemy team was extremely fed, and two of my team members quit. I was talking to the Ao Kuang on my team and I said ""They're pretty much acting like there are no lanes"" in response to their constant ganking.

This led me to thinking, filled with nothing but jungle. No lanes, no phoenixes, tower or Minotaur. You'd be running around the jungle, or perhaps waiting around a corner for your next enemy to wander by, when from behind Loki attacks. In an instant your dead, not knowing what hit you. The closest thing I can compare this to is The Hunger Games. I'm sure you've all read, with a game play similar to Arena. 400 tickets, not being able to see the enemy, looking for your next kill. I think the mode would have tons of potential. I

No wards
Higher passive gold and experience gain to make up for no creep farming.
More jungle camps and fury camps to allow for buffs and small amounts of gold and experience.

That's all I've come up with for now, that the community would enjoy a lot. I ask Hi-Rez to please consider this. I personally get excited just thinking about the possibility of it. Please consider the mode, and I ask the community to discuss it, and if you do I ask you to show support to bring attention to it. Please vote with what you think here!

&gt;*Rahu was a clever Asura, Amrit: an alchoholic beverage that not only made the spirits pleasant, but also made the body all-powerful. It was the source of the Devas never-ending youth and great health. And it was something the Asuras lusted for.*

&gt;*Rahu, disguised as a Deva. When he saw his chance, he took it - but his luck was short lived, for the Sun and the Moon noticed him when others had not, and in their vigilance they alerted Vishnu, who used one of his avatars to quickly decapitate Rahu before he could swallow one drop.*

&gt;*But the drink of the Devas is powerful - drink still in mouth, they spend their time circling the heavens, harassing the sun and moon and causing the terrifying eclipses of both.*

&gt;*Rahu and Ketu look down upon the land - they sense conflict is growing. For Rahu, a heavenly battle means there's only more greatness to be earned.*

**i don't have access to a scanner

right off the bat
___


**Passive: Synergy**

Rahu and Ketu are two halves of what once was whole. Every skill they land on an enemy god brings them closer in synergy with their original form, but breaks their synergy.

---Perfect Synergy: 5

---Mana reduction per unit of Synergy: 10%

* 
* Their passive is all about spamming spells. why? so you can spam more spells. aesthetically

___

**Skill 1: Seething Volley**

Ketu volleys Rahu a distance away

---Volley Damage: 20/40/60/80/100 (+40%)

---AoE Damage: 10/20/30/40/50 (+20) every .5 seconds for 2 seconds.

---Duration: 2 seconds

---CD: 14

* 
* In this skill, he is invulnerable and he has a big, obvious aura to prove it - if you want to deal damage to the god unit, you MUST attack Ketu, NOT Rahu. he will not even take CC, although if you afflict Ketu with CC he will be afflicted with the status when he returns.

___

**Skill 2: Frigid Specter**

Rahu sends Ketu to float off and assault an enemy god

---Slow: +5% slow every .3 seconds.

---Damage Per Tick: 10/25/40/55/70 (+10%) every .5 seconds for 3 seconds.

---Duration: 2 seconds

---CD: 12

* 
* So in this skill, just drifts along and lets his cold aura do the work for him.

___

**Skill 3: Disorient**

Rahu and Ketu split up, dealing heavy impact damage to any enemy hit en route and mesmerizing them. 

---Movement speed: +25%

---Damage Reduction: 50%

---Impact Damage: 40/80/120/160/200 (+20%)

---Mezmerize Duration: .5/1/1.5/2/2.5 seconds

---CD: 18

* 
* This one is kind of tricky to explain

* Step 1: pick a target for your *GREEN* destination. one of them (chosen at random) flies to that location.

* Step 2: you have up to 2 seconds to pick a target for your *RED* destination. (the other one) flies to that location.

* When both make it to their destination

* So for example, which means Rahu was the decoy and Ketu was the escape.

___

**Ultimate: Sun and Moon**

Rahu and Ketu join at the neck to become one entity and stand their ground, causing any enemy to be caught in the beam to be severely hindered by burns and frost. If they are in Perfect Synergy, their effects are even greater.


---Burn Charges: 20/24/28/32/36 (+10%) every .2 seconds.

---Perfect Synergy (Burn): Interrupts spellcasting every .5 seconds

---Frost Charges: 40% slow on affected enemy

---Perfect Synergy (Frost): -15% protections

---Charge Duration: 3 seconds

---CD: 90

* 
* it's a short pulse with a build up that is basically some damage and a laundry list of debuffs. you get hit by the pulse

* but the real fun begins if Rahu and Ketu were in perfect synergy. if they were, but you loose protections on top of it.

**Design Intent:** 

Rahu and Ketu need a special kind of treatment, and they rely on decoys to disorient the enemy and accomplish their goals.

basically

but of course, and they stand their ground and hold steadily while making that statement. not every time is a time to flee and be deceptive - sometimes you need to show your strength to achieve your goal.

It seems like people always say Wards are an incredible purchase and have a huge impact on the game.

But why do I feel like people don't buy them?

1370855978.0,1g1az5,Balancing Jungle - it's partly up to us as players,fabric9,37,15,25,"First of all, in the other the team without a jungler wins 9 times out of 10 (which was the case prior to the Bumba's patch).

Balancing it so that jungling becomes an option is almost *impossible*

This is because the limit to how much exp/gold the jungle gives is based upon how fast the jungle camps respawn - not how fast you can clear it. If Hirez were to change the jungle so that there were more exp/gold camps

Not only that, thus removing the strain of maintaining 4-5 wards on your team (300 gold every 3 minutes - or a free kill every 3 minutes).

**TL;DR**: In order for the jungle to be an *option*

---

Second, and partly because of a lack of support for a designated solo lane. As pointed out elsewhere, people just assume that ""left is solo"" because that's where the jungler starts. That makes little sense though, as the jungler no longer is required to lane at all. He can sustain entirely off the jungle, and so, as suggested previously by someone else, the duo lane should be placed on the part of the map where you need most early game presence. The gold fury side.

And junglers need to key in on that fact. They need to be able to realize that *hey, but once people start picking up on it, it'll be common practice. The only question that really remains is whether gold fury isn't too hard to do that early. For example, one person should not be able to poke at 4 people doing gold fury and manage to prevent it, or the whole idea falls on it's face.

**TL;DR**: Hirez may need to look at rebalancing gold fury in the early game to enable a solo lane to exist

---

Third, fire giant, and two buff camps (white/blue). This will limit your opponents jungler from invading and heavily prevent ganking (a 5th ward at the enemy red would be nice if they have a jumping jungler). The problem is that wards automatically give vision of other wards, which means each time you ward you may trigger a ward-war. This is troublesome, for many of the spots that Blue team would like to ward, Red team would also like to ward.

The best solution to this problem would be to change the ward system by introducing a second type of ward that grants vision of other wards, not of other wards. This will allow for more ward-placements without triggering ward-wars.

With time, and possibly at the enemy red in the case of a jumping jungler on the enemy team. The last ward is the responsibility of the solo laner, which should be placed at the enemy blue/white.

**TL;DR**: Hirez needs to look at revamping the ward system

---

In summary, the biggest of which is to start working as a *team of 5 players* instead of being stuck in the mindset of ""this is my lane, I will win it"". I think, given time, these changes could make Smite a much, much more interesting game, not only competitively,SUGGESTION,1370856511.0,t3_1g1az5

I just want to start off by saying I am by no means pro

**Wall of Text Warning**

First thing I want to talk about is playing other characters.  Now I know what you are thinking ""I am not good with XYZ characters, you need to know first hand how XYZ play and what combo's you could see from them.  As you play other characters, you will start to realize things about them you may not see on a regular basis... and who knows you may like them!  As an example, anyone like Posiedon could toss a wirlpool right on top of you if you are the red jungle camp beside middle lane and start ganking you 2-3 seconds before you even know where they are.   I have even seen people steal red jungle buff camp from me from middle lane by tossing spells over.  Not to say this is the main reason for playing other characters, but knowing your enemy will let you know how to beat them.  I strongly recommend everyone try and become well versed in all classes and damage dealers ranging from Magic to Phystical, Assassin to Tank, and everything in between.  The more your know about your opponent

On the subject of knowing other characters, but if you are constantly losing late game, is it because your team battles are losing?  Arena is a fantastic way to get a ton of experience for late game conquest and I STRONGELY recommend everyone play it, at least for the win of the day favor.

Next up, hands down, the worst things you can use.  Now if you just started the game and have 2 games under your belt, by all means use them.  They are generally not horrendous, but 99% of the time you will benefit more from choosing your own skills and own items.  ""But Hogie, I have a custom made auto buy I use and not the default"", well you are one step up from starting, and your auto build if getting you some physical defense, pop Aegis and laugh as you turn around and murder that sneaky ganking Posiedon.

On the note of items

Play defensive!  Before level 5, most can run in circles while their archers kill you in 5 seconds.  Don't do this!  Another thing not to do at low levels is chase an enemy hero.  Everyone wants that early game kill that will let them get the advantage, but forcing your enemy hero back to base and 30-40 seconds of lost exp is a HUGE advantage early game.  This could mean 1-2 levels you are gaining that they are not, but if you chased and got killed by the tower the tables have changes.  **Do not** put yourself in the position to die early game to something stupid like minions or towers because you only have yourself to blame if you do.  Early game is *the most important time* of the game and will make or break the potential of your hero.  Stay back, play it defensively and get the exp from minions.  I like to put my first point in to something that will help me push my lane rather than kill.  When I play Loki, my first point is in Decoy to push my lane, but I do not put a second point in to it unless late game when its the only skill I can put a point in to.

*Jungling* in smite is not ideal, but never burn *all* of your skills on these camps in case a enemy hero is lurking.  If an enemy hero is stalking you in the jungle, they generally try and steal your buff and then go for the kill or run.  If i see this happening I like to immediately focus the hero and hope they are still going for the buff.  In any jungle camp situation where you are attacking the mobs and an enemy hero is coming in, you are out of position so never forget this!   Positioning and getting the jump on people in Smite is 90% of the battle and throwing your opponent off will get you a lot of kills.  Scare someone who is jungling in to using a skill early, and you get the kill.  Get scared because an enemy hero got the jump on you, and be killed.

**Know your surroundings!**. (Added thanks to a_jlt_sandwich's suggestion)
At first glance looking at the game, every skill, and every part of the map has it own sounds and getting to know them will help you greatly!  Going back to the learning other characters section, get to know what their abilities sound like too!  Some ability sounds will indicate you have 1 or 2 seconds to react, but what happens if you hear an ability that you don't have time to dodge?  Something like Aegis could be used her to nullify an ultimate you know you cannot avoid ;).  Ra's Beam for example has a very easy to hear sound not only when it is moving, but when he starts it as well (Same with Ra's Ultimate).  If you are mid lane vs Ra and you are running and hear his beam, understanding this sound will let you side step left or right in time for it to not hit you; and this could mean living or dying.  Aside from ability sounds, you can hear the jungle mobs from any lane.  If you and your lane partner are together left, your team may not be able to scramble in time to get there

The last thing I want to touch on, and use them on the regular.  I am still learning a lot of these, but they will make you and your team work together!  Keep in mind most of these commands also have general's with them that are also of use.  VAA would give you just ""Attack!"" and can be a good one to initiate a team fight, where VA1 would only give you Attack Left Lane.

* VA(X) - Attack X Lane!
* VF(X) - Enemy Missing X Lane (VFF - Enemy Missing)
* VT(X) - Enemy Has returned to X Lane - If you call a missing Enemy
* VD(X) - Defend X Lane!
* VC(X) - Careful X Lane!.  Also VCC is just ""Careful!""
* VS(X)(X) - Self commands.  Examples would be VSA(S) ""I'll attack X Lane""
* VVV(X) - More self commands geared towards giving your team information.  Example VVVR Ultimate if Ready and VVVD Ultimate is Down.  Great info for team battles and will let your tank know not to engage yet if your Ultimate is down.
* VVVG - ""Group Up!""  Great for late game if the other team is pushing as a group.  VVVG + VD(X) is a great combo to tell your team ""Group Up"" and then ""Defence X Lane"".
** VVVT - ""It's a trap!""

3.) More scrims being streamed where you can see both sides or the teams are in voice chat with each other for some good natured banter. Oh and more transparency when those are on. Could be as simple as the teams announcing it on twitter and there's a separate twitter dedicated to retweeting those type of announcements.

10.) Awesome tournament graphics by Inuki. Better tourney promotion in general. ""It starts now announcement"" and ""this is the wrap up"" on reddit
