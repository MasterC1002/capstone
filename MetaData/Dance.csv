Once a week (or two weeks, they will give a time constraint and 1-3 other rules as they see fit*. Then, the general populace will have 6-13 days (again, depending on the deadline of the challenge) to record a video of them dancing to the song. Once the video is recorded, the entrant posts it as a reply to the challenge post. On the day of the deadline, whoever posted the challenge will judge the entries and choose a ""winner,"" who will post the next challenge. 

To clarify

*Regarding the 1-3 other rules, etc. What makes a challenge fun, though, is having a bit of direction without putting too much constraint on the type of performance, so to future challenge posters, keep that in mind.

All that said

For years I have admired ballet, I have danced before, Did a contempory dance class thing for a couple of years when I was around 10 but Ive always maintained that ballet is for 'gays when I know full well it isnt, My mum would probably be supportive and take me but im just afraid of the huge amount of prejudice there seems to be towards guys who start doing ballet. Im 17 and a half, 6 foot tall and well built, Not particularly muscular but not fat, Ill get a picture yet, Also would they put me with some like beginner kiddie group to learn because that would probably put me right off

I decided to become a ballet dancer when I was 5, and I concluded that the sacrifice for becoming a professional would be too big (very long term I'd suffer from bad chronic back pain (still have chronic back problems, but doesn't bother me too much in my day to day life) less long term I, short term because I would have to give up every waking moment to manage to keep my back healthy enough to keep dancing etc. and lots of other things) I was 19 when I stopped.

After I had made the decision to stop dancing I was a complete wreck and  had a big identity crisis and went through a depression for a few months (still kind of recovering three years later... I'm not the same person I used to be.. and occasionally have break downs crying because I miss dancing so much

I left the last ballet class I had

This may sound crazy for some

Anyway, and never actually be able to reach the level I wanted to reach.

But then I think back to when I was a kid, and I'm going there for a free trial class on Monday, but I'm scared to death!

Has anyone else had any similar experiences? Can anyone give me any advice or warnings on what to expect or tips on how to prepare

I'm worried I'll be too bad

I'm hoping I'll still be able to do some things, I'm hoping it can be the start of a new ""era"" where I can actually enjoy dancing again and do it quite regularly.

It could easily go both ways and thinking about it is making me a mess.

help..?

one more question..

I have one more issue that I would just like to put out there to sort of organize my thoughts or whatever, and I am currently working out and eating healthy to try to ""get my body back"" (If I weighed the same now as when I was dancing I would be thrilled because now I actually see how thin that was! I never appreciated it bck then, which really sucks! :P) but I'm still a lot ""softer"" to put it nicely than I would like to be and I'm worried this will freak me out when I see myself back in a ballet setting where my expectations for what I should see in the mirror are very different from the mirrors at home... I'm assuming I'm not the only one who's body has changed after not dancing for hours a day, and if you wouldn't mind I would really appreciate to hear about how you handled this when going back to dance! Hope I'm not asking too much or too personal, but we all know I think that with ballet half (or more :P) is kind of how you look. No matter how good you are you won't ""look"" good or at least not get a job unless you're thin, so my body image is pretty messed up. It's a lot better now that I haven't been dancing, so that's why I'm worrying it might go back to being completely twisted and messed up again... I'm repeating myself now I think

My SO is a dancer/choreographer, and iTunes does not make it easy to rewind the piece - it's designed for skipping forward and back, rather than rewinding/fast forwarding.  Also, when other dancers wanted to start playing the music for a different piece, they didn't know which piece of music was for which piece of dance.

Knowing how to code, but I want more input before I get started.

Here are some of the ideas we developed:

- rewind and fast forward buttons, and 'pause' buttons
- a field for the dance piece's title
- remote control
- music ""checkpoints"", if there's a phrase you want to practice, you can immediately jump to the start of that phrase at the push of a button.
- automatic beat analysis, but the algorithms to do the analysis exist)

Questions for all of you

1. Would this be helpful? Would you use it? If your current player had some or all of the above features
2. What other features do you think would helpful?  Are there different ways to implement the above features that you think could be more helpful?
3. Is there already a music player available that is better for choreography and dance?  Even if it isn't explicitly made for dancers/choreographers

A video perhaps even a tutorial would do great. Maybe even an inspiring story. Or perhaps maybe someone can share exactly how they practice at home.

First, classes, events, and in very fortunate, rare cases, discussion with celebrities of the scenes. Now, enough about myself.

Hip Hop is defined as a culture, Scratching (DJing), Graffiti (tagging), and Bboying (break dancing). The parentheses denote mainstream nomenclature. Rule of thumb: if it isn't one of the above, it isn't hip hop. Even the dance styles such as locking and popping (two COMPLETELY separate dance styles, by the way) aren't considered hip hop; they are called funk styles that began in the 60s as a series of ""party dances"" that were strung together, developed

Now, it isn't hip hop. Second, these classes began around the 90s when studio jazz dancers started to imitate and replicate the street dance styles (breaking, popping, locking, vogue) and teach it to their students. It increased exposure of a ""hip hop"" style but it neglected the roots and history of where these jazz dancers got the moves they taught.

This leads to the biggest issue of the so-called ""hip hop"" dance style (or, six-step, and baby freeze. There is ALWAYS a basic fundamental in every dance for people to learn in styles such as ballet and jazz, yet what are the basics for ""hip hop"" choreography? A bboy can tell you what the basics moves for bboying. A ""hip hop"" choreographer can not. In this practical, basic definition alone, true hip hop dance is bboying.

I say all this with no disrespect to dancers such as Shaun Evaristo, and many others whom I hold the highest esteem for, but true hip hop dance heroes are the bboys such as Storm and Ken Swift and many leaders of the bboy scene today such as Kid David, Casper, Machine, and the countless, talented, but history is important and to ignore it is to ignore the hard work of many who kept true hip hop moving forward. Just because something isn't hip hop doesn't mean it is not beautiful

I loved the answers!

* But

Pretty much a site that curates a large amount of dance videos from dance groups.
Kind of like Techcrunch for Dance. I digest large amounts of information for my field and sites like Techcrunch &amp; Business Insider does it perfectly, Fader or Pitchfork magazine is closer to what I'm looking for Dance. (I want to be immersed in it)

* The website has to exist
The closest thing I've run into is Worldofdance.com. They're great

* I want more of an overall digest of 100's of dance groups not just the two.
at the moment my main digest for dance inspiration is Mywaydance and Yak films. They both do brilliant jobs. But I'm looking for a website that covers all of them.

Thanks guys!!!

1321070291.0,m9h35,This is pretty embarrassing but I thought I'd share a story (and possibly get some feedback as well?),,8,0,10,"First: I had an incredibly long

I should start by saying that I'm a 24 year old, and I'm not sure if that's why, but I also didn't like it that much. I played a bit growing up but never joined a team and stuck to playing on outdoor rinks mostly because all my friends also played. It was always more of a social thing for me, I hated the cold and couldn't stand the older kids who acted like they were gonna be the next Gretzky. 

My mom had always been a fan of dance movies. I guess that's pretty common to any woman who was in her 20's during the 80's and it would be a lie to say that watching those with her weren't part of me growing up. I was raised speaking only in French but I could recite every single line from west side story (deeeeaaar kindly sergeant Krupke!) before I could speak proper English

Anyways. When I was a bit older I had a friend who's cousin took a hip hop dance class. At one point I guess the word got out in their family that it was a good way to get the kids off the N64 and my buddy started taking the classes as well. After a while they'd be more that happy to show their moves off every chance they got and got me really interested. I wasn't too aware of what the hell hip hop was yet (I was 9 or so) but it seemed cool to me, and as a 9 year old (still true today) I had so many interests that it was probably hard for my parents to know if it was something I actually was gonna enjoy or something I'd get sick of after a month.

Fifteen years or so later. I'm 24 now and I still want to dance. I don't want to do it as a career but I've seen multiple dance shows in the last couple of years (I've moved for college and now have access to a lot more culture) and I've pursued education in a scientific field which I love but I still have the desire to just do it. When I'm alone I'll sometimes clear an area in my room, get slightly embarrassed and stop. I've never told anybody this before, not even my girlfriend of 4 years. We did attempt 2 different dancing classes: salsa and swing, but didn't enjoy it. Both classes required the girls to go around and switch partners (which I heard is pretty common in those classes) so I ended up spending 90% of the evening with strangers and it kinda took the fun out of it. The Youtube practice sessions thing have come in handy though as I often get complimented on my sense of rhythm when I dance at parties or when I'm out with friends, something that surprises everyone because you couldn't tell by looking at me (way to skinny for my height, comic book/science-related t-shirt, typical nerd look)

And that's it. This is my story r/dance. I've thought of taking classes before

I want to learn to be really fluid (body rolls) and how to have sharp clean movements (flicking head/arm). I've heard jazz or contemporary is good for this. Does anyone have experience with these? Or can you recommend a different class- pole maybe?

I started dancing for the first time in my life last year and although I love it, waltz, street dance, latin, and zumba classes and haven't improved much. I feel I'm missing key basics. I started doing bellydance/tribal fusion to learn better control but it was very technical and I found I couldn't apply it much to the other dancing I was doing. It was also very discouraging because it takes years before you get anything out of it (unlike some of the others- ceroc, etc). I love dancing but would like to be part of a class where I can see improvements. The movement in bellydance was too micro (at a beginners level).

It was hard finding some music that's appropriate for that big of an age range but I settled on ""Us"" by Regina Spektor (I realize Regina is somewhat overdone for Modern
My first studio ordered catalog costumes for every number and sometimes those got a bit tiring; I'm not a fan of the super-overdone sequin dresses as the whole thing looks too ""competition"" style. My second studio gave a fair mix of catalog costumes and home-made ones, get some black short-shorts and we'll throw a nice top on it.""

""Respect My Step is a project set to connect the dance community via viral video and social identity. An online network where dancers and non-dancers alike can come together to share ideas in dance, Jermaine Browne, and technologist, Edgardo Burgos, began to discuss the future of dance as well as advancements in technology.

“I wanted to give dance a bigger voice.” said Jermaine. “Get it to a larger audience and put a name to the nameless faces who share a passion for dance. A place to bring everyone together.”

“Technology affects every sector in life and culture

Together, and created the perfect synergy of technology and dance. With a name like Respect My Step - everyone can relate. Jermaine explains: “Peoples passions are a part of them and they shouldn’t be judged for what they enjoy to do. You are who you are and you should be respected for that.”

why, sloppy bodies, no style, and no experience get cast more than i do? there's a top tier of dancers that get cast in literally everything (student and faculty pieces) and it's impossible to break into that caste, but additionally, it seems like literally everyone else but me can get good parts- even the really horrible dancers. it's like i'm completely invisible. i work so hard and get no results at all. i just want to dance to my potential, and no one is willing to give me a try. 

has anyone else been in this rut? what did you do to get yourself noticed? how did you become a better dancer? i'm co-choreographing a duet for our spring show with a good friend of mine and i really hope that it will showcase what i can do,False,,t5_2qhs0,False,,,t3_189s52
