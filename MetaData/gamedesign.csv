As a result of that post

I wanted to introduce myself as a moderator, which I think reddit has really been in need of for some time.

There are many game development subreddits, however, is just as much of a discipline as programming, or visual art, or music composition.  There's a ton of information for us to share with each other, and there's a vastly greater amount that is still waiting to be discovered.

Game design is historically speaking

So, technical issues, sales/marketing, or culture.  **We can have an entire subreddit devoted entirely to the creation of good rule-sets.**

**Call to action!**

What we will need if we want to get some traction is for all of us to tell some friends about the subreddit and ask them to subscribe.  I think that once we get to a certain threshold, I know that there are thousands of people who would subscribe, but they simply haven't heard of it and don't know what it is.


**About me!**

-----------------------------------
**Subjects to Adjust**

- **Numeric

Slider/Knob Balance is about balancing in-game attributes or numbers to change the difficulty of the game. This is about making enemies or obstacles stronger

While effective up to certain degrees

Slider/Knob balance can also be applied to procedural generation of levels or areas by making them more dense

- **Enhanced AI**

An effective means of challenging a player is making your enemies smarter or more aggressive. While AI isn't easily incorporated into every type of game or genre

A good example of this type of difficulty scaling can be see in a generic tactical shooter. Basic enemy AI may have the instruction to shoot at the player on sight, call for reinforcements, use grenades to force players out of cover, and do various combinations of those to keep the pressure on the player.

- **Special Treatment/Home Field Advantage**

Treating enemies as if they're above the rules applied to your player is another way of being able to adjust difficulty. When your player is injured

A good example of this is leash back(read: anti-kite) mechanics used in A-RPGs/MMORPGs. Players may often try to exploit movement or combat mechanics to get an edge of enemies. While they're right to do so, would be to limit how far an enemy will pursue a player, while rapidly restoring their health if they were damaged during one of these exploit attempts.

- **Resource Deprivation/Away Field Disadvantage**

Similarly, ammo, etc) can provide more challenge to players by forcing them to rely on strategies they may not have needed to use in different difficulty settings, or by forcing them to make decisions about their resource usage.

A good example of this can be found in survival horror games. Harder modes of Resident Evil include a lower number of ammunition and health restoration items

- **Randomization**

Randomization can throw a wrench into the plans of players. While randomization is present in many games in some form or another

Commonly randomized things in game involve player attributes(popular among D&amp;D style games), enemy properties, and enemy attributes, and areas and enemies procedural generated areas and enemies

When considering adding randomization to your game as some core component

-------------------------------
**Ways to Change

In addition to these types

- **In-The-Box** or Static Balance.

Also potentially named ""Don't actually offer dynamic difficulty.""

This methodology largely relies on *not* balancing the game beyond initial play tests. While this is an obvious option

- **Progressive Difficulty**

The game becomes harder the further the player is along in the game

This is common in many games, or otherwise smarter and as terrain becomes more perilous towards the end of a game.

However, the harder it is for the player to make full lines.

Nearly all other difficulty modes work exceptionally well with this concept.

- **Difficulty Settings

Allowing the player to select their difficulty settings. These are usually preset to the traditional Easy/Normal/Hard

A good example of this is the difficulty settings for Fallout New Vegas. While you could choose different, which added an entirely new set of rules and resources to the already existing game.

- **Flexible Difficulty

Players are in full, or somehow gain access to change these later.

One of the best examples of this type of system is from Bastion. Bastion incorporated flexible difficulty settings as not only part of the game

- **Performance Scaling**

The challenge of the scale changes depends on how well(or poorly) a player does. The more complete the player's mastery of your game is, every player is adequately challenged without them expressly needing to select a challenge mode.

Be careful with offering alternative game content based on performance

Element systems are useful for game designers who intend on adding a familiar

Many element systems are attributed to classic RPGs

------------------------------------
**List of Basic Element Systems**

- **Binary/Polarized:** [Silhouette Mirage](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silhouette_Mirage) &amp; [Ikagura](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ikaruga)

Or, making it great for faster paced games.  Many games that use this system actually have three or four effectual elements, but the other two are usually not spoken of, or are implied.  

As an example: Hot, Both(Superior).

Some systems use this as a literal 'Off' and 'On' type of effect


- **Trio/Rock-Paper-Scissors:**  [Azure Dreams](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azure_Dreams)

Systems of 3 are popular in Action RPGs and classic RPGs
 
These systems usually follow the balance trio of Fire, Fire beats Air, Air beats Water.  Some games allow the combination of two or all of the elements to create a 'super' element superior to the rest, and most include the absence of any element(physical or non-elemental.)

These systems encourage a player to possess or command at least two of the three elements when possible

Naturally, Air trend to use a RPS style opposition.


- **Classic(Greek) Elements**

By classic elements, though some games do venture into the Hot/Cold/Wet/Dry territory and focus on combination.

Classic element systems use cancellation/nullification rather than certain elements being somehow superior to others.  Some games follow Aristotle's version of this and incorporate aether/ether/spirit as an additional


- **Natural(Chinese) Elements:** Dungeons and Dragons

Some games adapt nature or material into their element systems, though Chinese elements only focus on Wood and Metal.

Many games opt to add things such as silver(werewolves) and iron(fae/undead) as elements


- **Element Wheel/Cube:** [Star Ocean 2](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Ocean:_The_Second_Story)

Pushing further, use a large number(7+) of elements, often needing to split classical ones(Water into Water and Ice, Fire into Fire and Heat, Air into Air and Lightning, etc), or include more abstract(Holy/Unholy) elements to increase the complexity of their system.  Element Wheels and Cubes tend to follow either nullification or RPS opposition

- **Element Matrix** [PokeMon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pokemon)

The Element Matrix is worth mentioning on its own, but rarely supreme over all.  

These complex systems are used to force the player to understand other mechanics in the game in addition to memorizing


----------------------------

**What I hope you take away from this:**

In short

Interaction:

- **Polarized: Direct and singular opposition.**  Like elements are resisted/harmless/beneficial
- **RPS/Cyclic Opposition.** Like elements are resisted/harmless/beneficial
- **Nullification: Equal Opposing Forces.**  No elements are superior

Abstraction:

- **Material Inclusion: Objects and materials as elements.**  Elements can be more than the basal things and...
- **Elemental Influence: Elements can interact with more than just other elements
- **Wheel/Cube Design
- **Matrix Design.** Elements have multiple types of interaction with other elements.

There are tons of ways to abstract from element systems

Let me start by defining some key terms we'll need along the way:

-------------------------
- **Confidence:** *Noun*

1: The feeling or belief that one can rely on someone or something; firm trust: ""we had every confidence in the staff"".

2: The state of feeling certain about the truth of something.


- **Ego:** *Noun*

1: A person's sense of self-esteem or self-importance: ""a boost to my ego"".

2: The part of the mind that mediates between the conscious and the unconscious and is responsible for reality testing and a sense of self.


-------------------------

**Confidence

People may notice that there is a significant amount of high levels of self-esteem(ego) among successful, and Richard Garriott from the example I provided above.

These two men, saying (Tommy) ""I don't make shit games,"" or ""Other game designers suck.""

Are they right?  Are they inspirational or legendary game designers? Does everyone else 'suck' in the light of their majesty? 

**That's *really* not important

They design games.  Actual games.  Games that exist

Although Tom and Dick might have the social graces of belligerent penguins, at least.)

The confidence that they have allow them to skip the fear and overcome vices that comes with being associated with a creative industry.  Fears like like [Impostor syndrome](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome), and general laziness.   

In short: **They're manic, although may be incredibly stressful for both them and those they associate with.

When I see a particularly arrogant person in a creative role(rappers and writers more than most)

**Now, I don't hate them, dislike them, or even think poorly of them.   I *respect* them, because I know that they're going to try, and are willing to suffer as they try.  

I also *pity* them, and I also know what it's like to believe in yourself, and have other people think less of you for it.  Showing some humility does help with the latter, though behaving in a socially acceptable way doesn't make you the topic of conversation as often.

As game designers, and sometimes a key component to a game's success in the eyes of its audience.

But how can you tell a meaningful story in this energy-charged genre?  Here


**Methods of Story Delivery in Fast-Paced Games.**

------------------------

- **Classic Method #1: Visual**

Many classic action games tell parts of their story visually.  A quick and easy to understand example of this concept is Ryu, or some other form of martial arts.   With just basic understanding of martial arts(even movie/TV knowledge of it), you can quickly tell that he is not only a practitioner of martial arts, but a master(black belt) and possibly a competitive one(padded gloves.)   An [intelligent design](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryu_\(Street_Fighter\)#Character_design) can quickly fill in blanks about a character without needing to explicitly say it.   This also extends to more subtle details, such as [posing](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/e/e1/DDragon_Leebros.jpg) or props.

A higher level example of visual story telling is scene and environment design.  In **Mega Man X4's** introduction level

You can probably quickly tell me what's going on.   You can see from the background that it is a city.  There are spotlights running in the background

Now, you could still tell that the city was under attack within mere seconds of being in the level.   


- **Classic Method #2: Reading**

**""Your princess is in another castle, many action (especially action rpg) games to follow employ the heavy use of reading in order to fill in the blanks.   While this is expected, and sometimes even desired in RPGs, action games have their pace broken by using this too much.

If you intend to use text elements in your action based game

[Here's an example from **Metal Gear Solid**.](
http://www.metalgearplanet.com/images/MetalGearSolid/Mgs1%20Photos/otaconcloseup.JPG)  Exciting



- **Classic Method #3: Cut scenes.**

Cut scenes, you generally know what they're for.   In short words, cut scenes are scenes acted out by characters containing action, dialogue, or both, and are either out of control of the player entirely, or the players have very limited influence over it, or by Quick-Time Events.

Also like the reading component

------------------------------

Now that you've seen a few classic examples of action genre storytelling

- **Modern Method #1: ""Banter"" or Incidental Audio**

Incidental dialogue and exchanges between characters has been a tried and effective method of delivering the story. Action RPGs and squad based FPS games use something frequently referred to as party/squad banter.  Games like **Dragon Age and Mass Effect** employ this regularly to inject background lore(and frequently humor) into the game play, or other circumstances without being a significant distraction from the action of the game.

Be careful not to confuse this with dialogue systems

- **Modern Method #2: ""Narration"" or Overlaying Audio**

While hardly a modern concept

Game Narration is a very unique type of narration.  Since games are interactive

This gives games the potential to have Narrators with changing or unique dispositions.  Rucks of Bastion is a great example of a consistent but supportive narrator


- **Modern Method #3: ""Audio Logs/Communicators"" or Responsive Audio**

The last approach I will discuss is  the 'Audio Log.'  This method of story telling involves a player either finding an object or completing a certain objective

**Borderlands 2** uses this effectively to handle both storytelling and in-game quests(another mechanic that hurts action pacing if handled improperly.)

**Diablo 3** uses this concept to give in-depth lore about creatures, and gives the player a secondary, non-hero perspective to the events within the game.

(Note: My current concern is for a 2d top down game regarding generic baddies so some of this doesn't apply but it's still worth thinking about)

What first to mind is good use of sound and animation.  However games like Assassin's Creed where the animations are well done get old after a while if kills are meaningless

The next though is to add meaning to the NPC's death in an attempt to engage the player's emotions

The next thought is a scenario where the NPC has challenged the player enough to warrant respect, then finally finish him with a slow motion final strike.

1365063471.0,1bnec3,A discussion on power progression paradigms in gaming,Alarack,19,4,38,"I have played a great many games over the years. I’m also in the process of designing several games of my own. In all but the most basic of games

On the one side, clearly better powers replace those early powers at later levels. We see this fairly often. D&amp;D tends to follow this model with their spells. Most higher level spells of the same school, are clearly better than spells of a lower level. 

I’m not especially fond of this particular method of power progression because invariably, like I’m being dumbed down.

Though in defense of this model


In opposition to planned obsolescence, which makes for a cleaner list of powers since the same version of a power doesn’t need to be listed multiple times with ever increasingly cooler sounding names. The powers are differentiated more by the situations they are useful in, rather than some being better than others. 

This might seem like the optimal method, you have powers that will sit dormant for most of the game until such a time that the power in question is allowed to shine. Additionally, as the character progresses through the game there isn’t a clear feeling of improvement. I personally like the feeling that I’m growing more powerful as I progress through a game.

Another caveat to the neutrality of powers model is that it can be very difficult to balance. If all powers are supposed to be equal, but by accident, then you have a rickety game. This is often seen in games like Diablo 3, where you have a grand selection of powers, all supposedly equal to each other, but some powers are almost universally ignored due to simply not being as viable in as many situations, or just not as good outright.


I’d like to hear your opinions on these two paradigms

-Squad leaders will gain tactical commands to isse to squad members. The main example I have is a ""supress"" command.

-In order to better combine air power and ground assaults, glowig outline. This would make it easier to prioritize designated targets. Then, in order to incentivize the usage of this mehanic, there would be a good amount of points for a designation assist and the air vehicle would recieve more points than normal for a ""priority kill"". So, imagine that a tank is pinning down a few people who are holding an objective. One of the men lazes the tank.

1368424141.0,1e8alw,An idea for difficulty scaling in an open world and punishment for death. Feedback welcome!,Jackissocool,13,0,70,"I'm in the design stages for a Metroidvania-style RPG. The whole point of the game is that you can tackle all of the bosses and areas, instead of the typical unlock-based advancement found in Metroidvanias.

I've been struggling with how to manage difficulty. Because the player will level up as they tackle each area and boss, and I also want the mechanic to be make sense in-game. I also want an appropriate punishment for death. I've been working over these problems over in my head for a few weeks now and have come up with a solution that will hopefully solve both of them.

My game has a day-night cycle, they lose any progress they made that night. Additionally, the enemy gets stronger with each passing day. This is a simple and elegant solution to my problem. 

Let's say a player decides to fight Boss A first. There are, and you can do 15 rooms a night. On Night 1, the player is killed in room 10. It's now Night 2. The player is fully recovered, but the rooms they cleared are now repopulated, and have slightly more or stronger enemies, depending on the enemy type. But the player is experienced with these enemies and knows how to beat them. They make it through all 15 rooms they can in one night. Night 3, they go again. They attack the same area and make it through 8 rooms before being killed. Again, and the player loses that night's progress. So they attack again on Night 4 and have to start from Room 15.

This system

* Each room can be designed with the same baseline dificulty, they will grow more difficult the longer you take to reach them.

* Death has a minor but permanent punishment

* There is a sense of urgency in the story

* Allows exploration and attacking to take place in any order the player chooses while still challenging the player at all times.

There is much more to the day night cycle

EDIT: I've received really great suggestions so far! Thank you guys so much for the help - this is my first game and it's great to have a community like this. I'd like to clarify a few things and post my current thoughts on this stem. 

* I still really like the general idea I've got here

* There will be a cap to how much more powerful enemies can be

* On death

* You have an army at your base that you can send out to attack at night. They consistently grow more powerful

* The leveling system will not be +numbers. It will be almost entirely based on new abilities, there well be a very definite sense of satisfaction when you get it right.

* Despite me calling it a Metroidvania

* On death

(For anyone interested

I wanted to throw out some ideas I've been juggling in my head

***

One thing that has been on my mind lately is the consistency of rules in games. By ""rules""

For example

1. Proceed to the right to progress through the level.
2. Jump on enemies you encounter to get rid of them.
3. Do not touch moving enemies with anything but the bottoms of your feet.
4. Hit '?' blocks to reveal an item.

It may seem obvious to you that these things need to always be true, the very rules they created for their game. I'll be a bit bold in introducing these ideas, and if you don't agree with me I hope that you're willing to discuss some other viewpoints or alternatives with me.


There are two levels to this concept:

**1. Never punish a player for doing something you taught them to do.**

**2. Any given rule must always apply.**


**1)** Imagine you're playing Super Mario Brothers

Even if there were spikes on the enemy's back

Every new rule should be introduced either in the beginning (think of a board game's instruction manual)

**2)** Going even deeper, I'm of the opinion that that would be poor design. Sure, it might introduce a higher level of suspense, but ultimately it is a poor design choice because it is an unreliable mechanism.

A lot of games, like to do the ""fake wall"" trick. Where along an entire stone corridor there is one wall that you can walk through to get to a secret area or proceed through the level. If proceeding through the game requires the ability to break or pass through a certain wall, please make the wall different from the others. Even if the difference is so minute that it's hard to notice in passing, at least it makes it a consistent rule. I say ""if proceeding through the game requires [it]"", because I believe that this rule shouldn't apply to easter eggs. Easter eggs or secrets are fun and not inherently important to the state of the game, so I don't find it harmful if you have to get lucky to find it.

**There's another side to this though...**

Does having 100% clear-cut and reliable rules interfere with its ability to be a game? If everything is black-and-white logic

Let's take into account the containers in Diablo. Some of them reward you for breaking them open

Most if not all video games have a form of life/hp, are numerous and I am a finite being - so I cannot give every example possible. What I do want to focus on, is the relationship of damage vs defense, from a specific angle of math.

 - Damage  

Linear Damage: All offensive points against an opponent increase through the gameplay, etc., but do so at a regular rate. Examples: MOBAS - Dota/LoL 

Stagnant Damage: Offense is generally horizontal to your character's strength. You don't powerup as much as you might learn new mechanics or focus in specific strengths for specific areas. Examples: Mega Man's Boss weapons

Exponential/large gain Damage: Damage, gain at phenomenal increments. A 10 damage sword was good for a few levels, but then a 20 damage sword shows up, later a 40 or 50, character bonuses might increase this further. Once 10 damage was good, but later 1000 damage is considered weak. Examples: Common in Rpgs/grinders - Diablo Series (specifically 2-3)

- Defense  

Linear Defense [Subtractive]: Damage is reduced by set amounts. Armor may reduce some damage more than others due to the flat damage reduction. Examples: Starcraft 1-2

Percent based scaling [Multiplicative]: Damage is reduced by %'s

Damage based scaling: Damage is reduced based on the strength of the hit. Only known example: Path of Exiles

- Using these games for math  

Warcraft 3, while LoL expands/simplifies this to ""DR% = armor / (armor +100)"" 
Each of these games has at least 3 damage types, or spell, useful for different circumstances. Increasing armor at the same speed as they increase damage often ends up neutralizing both players gains, dependent on the damage types-armors matchup. Dealing or receiving damage in Wc3 depended often on an entire army, with units offsetting different damage and armor types. In Dota/lol this is seen with the different character metas of commonly having heroes focused in disabling/ganking, nuking/spell damage, physical/dps

LoL % damage reduction [link](https://www.google.com/search?btnG=1&amp;pws=0&amp;q=x%2F(100%2Bx )

Diablo 1-2 and similar style games commonly use a form of evade or ""armor class"" to simulate dice rolls for melee or all physical attacks. However, the next ""world"" of difficulty was instantly more difficult instead of gradual.

Path of Exiles is a new game I just started playing, this near-linear reduction is actually different based on the damage being received. 100 armor roughly translates into ~8 damage reduction per hit, but this is assuming damage is high. When damage is low, it is reduced by a smaller flat variable of 3-4. This ensures that low damage is not removed, while high damage is still affected by armor. 

PoE Per hit damage reduction: [link] ( https://www.google.com/search?q=x*100%2F(100%2B12*x )

- Damage Types  

I've seen others post on this topic already so I will be brief. Damage types allow a player to subvert forms of defense. One of the simplest examples I can give is League of Legends. There are 3 damage types: Physical, and a few spells and is reduced by armor, Magical damage is generally done via spells which cost a resource, and is reduced by magic resistance, while True damage is much rarer and cannot be reduced. Each of these damage types is strategic, a team with mostly physical damage can be easier to stack armor against with only 1/5 characters dealing magic damage (assuming equal damage from all players), a team with more magic damage would allow you to counter more opponents by stacking ""MR."" Life on the other hand is still useful against all forms of damage and the armor types increase the effective life you have, which cannot be reduced

A very simple answer to the question “Character progression or Player Mastery” is “Why not both?”.  There’s actually an answer to that question - Batman: Arkham Asylum.  Batman: AA was praised as an adaptation of the comic book - a game that really made the player “feel like Batman”  I’d argue that the dueling progression systems in the game actually fight against that.

Arkham Asylum is a Metroidvania.  This means that weapons that are earned throughout play actually open up more of the playspace throughout the rest of the game.  However Arkham Asylum is also a brawler with an experience system.  Batman may earn more combat moves by being effective in combat.  Hang from a gargoyle as opposed to just perch

In other words, if I dig a lot, I’ll earn a better shovel, so that I can dig faster, so I can dig more.

The problematic part of it is the fact that Arkham Asylum’s gadget system is a perfectly serviceable marker of progression.  You get more gadgets as you progress in the story.  You progress in the story through mastery of the mechanics.  

It’s interesting because modern games - since about Deus Ex - have been about mixing these kinds of system rather than treat them as distinctively different styles of play.  The issue here though is that - as it is - by performing better at something in game, hunting / scavenging in Far Cry 3, and the weapon shop system in Assassin’s Creed.  

I just want to talk about the sort of mixing of Character Progression (i.e. RPG style levelling) and Player Mastery we're seeing in a lot of modern games.  Also games like [Candy Box](http://candies.aniwey.net/) and [Progress Quest](http://progressquest.com/) and [Linear RPG](http://sophiehoulden.deviantart.com/art/The-Linear-RPG-114501766) openly make fun of this process.  the issue being that instead of earning new mechanics

But also games like Portal and Doom measure their progression by player mastery.  Both slowly introduce new weapons and mechanics earned through gameplay

I posted this originally in r/tabletopgamedesign, I'm looking specifically for feedback on how to move some game mechanics from a virtual settings to a physical setting. Any ideas are wanted and welcome. Thanks!

Original post: http://www.reddit.com/r/tabletopgamedesign/comments/1cr862/looking_for_advice_on_creating_a_scifi_4xesque/


WARNING: Wall of text and very rough ideas present.

tl;dr: I'm creating a sci-fi 4X tabletop game. What advice can you give a first-time game developer and what resources should I know about to help ease this process?

I guess I should provide a little background before I get started; A few days ago, it stands for ""explore, expand, exploit, and exterminate."" To the gaming layman, this translates to an in-depth strategy game that takes everything from culture to economy into account when trying to conquer the galaxy/universe/whatever (4X seems to be pretty exclusive to sci-fi, but I could be totally wrong).

As I was pondering that thought, in which the social aspect adds a ton new depth.

I haven't put anything to paper yet, and then a totally unique exploration system (which I'll explain shortly), tech-tree (may be a bad idea), simple in-game economy (operative word is simple), cultural development of your race, etc.

What I have pieced together on my own so far is the race-creation and the early-game exploration system. I'll start with race creation: This is where the D&amp;D influence is heaviest. You'll start with a race-creation sheet that looks a lot like a character sheet for D&amp;D. You'll have spots for the usual stuff like your race's name, traits. Your traits will be determined by a roll of dice, in which you will discard the lowest roll and use the rest. The numbers you rolled will act as your race's base traits which will be stuff similar to ""intellect"" which can govern technology, ""charisma"" which can govern culture and inter-racial relations, and so on. Past the numeric traits, the player can cook up whatever lore or background they want for their race within reason.

Onto the exploration. At the start of the game, a ship can move out of the starting solar system and enter the next grid or ""sector."" Once in the next sector, the player will roll for the ship to determine if there is even a system there to begin with (for example rolling a 5+ on an 8 sided die would mean there is a system there), and if there is a system present, then how many habitable planets there are (any number rolled over the 5 needed to find a solar system determines how many habitable planets are present; rolling a 6 means there is one habitable planet, a 7 means there are two, etc. for a max of 3 planets per system.)
How will this exploration system work on a board game, you mark the board accordingly. Each player also has a unique color marker which they use to draw the boarder of their spacial territory, and other things specific to their empire. The marker idea seems to work best because it can be easily changed as you expand your empire or as someone else expands into you. (Note: the board will probably be rather large, but since it's a symmetrical gird, you can determine how much you actually use. This will dictate how long the game lasts. Very similar to choosing ""map size"" in a videogame.) The strength of this exploration system is that it ensures that every game will be extremely unique. The next time you play, the map will look totally different, forcing you to change up your strategies.

I apologize if little to none of this made sense to you. I promise that it does indeed make sense

So, are there any books/websites/tools I can use to help ease the development process along? Also, I'm open to ideas from the community. If there is something that you guys think should be a feature in this game, speak up. If I like it, I'll definitely put it in. I plan on posting a few more times regarding this, and if it generates any feedback, I'll post consistent updates as I progress.

Random questions:

-Does this seem like it can't work in a tabletop setting/has it been done before?

-This game wont be terribly difficult for those familiar with tabletop gaming

-Would it be a good idea to crowd-source ideas? Just ask people what they want to see in the game

1376224324.0,1k536b,The rise and scourge of fake content,ZerothLaw,25,16,28,"When I look at how games are designed, and bad ideas being repeated just because they were done before. 

One that really aggravates me is something I call ""fake content"". Basically

So there were a lot of tactics used, infinite levels, replays, and... fake content. The JRPGs were the worst offenders, but a lot of other games did it as well. 

This is where grinding comes from. All the random encounters

Most of it is there to take up your time. It doesn't add anything to the story

How many hours of your 70 hour FFVII playthrough is of item-juggling and grinding? How much was actually spent on the story? 

There are some arguments that the items, put you in it,  to create a narrative. 

This is a fair argument! 

But like many things in game design, combat mechanics, and its a **good** game. It gives you a distilled well-designed essence of one part of RPGs, the combat and mechanics and the dungeon-exploring - you have to fill in the dungeon map yourself, make notes, and so on. 

But the trick to how the Etrian Odyssey games does it well, and this leveling is often sufficient for you to be able to survive the next floor. Each floor is significantly harder, and the combat mechanics offer just enough depth and strategy to make all of this fighting interesting. Because of the difficulty engaging random encounters, this makes all of this a tense affair, because one bad roll, one bad move, can set you back, and if you don't put down a threat

Its little intricate design touches like all of that that make Etrian Odyssey games fun for me

But when there is no purpose to the leveling, knowing it will never ever come close to beating you... what is that encounter there for, if not to waste your time? 

And if that's there to waste your time

That battle with the slime was pretty much never a threat to you. So being able to beat a slime really easily becomes very quickly pointless. In the Etrian Odyssey games, its *how* its done that makes something fake content. 

Item juggling: 
I feel like items in RPGs are a distraction. You get so many items, we know there is a big difference between stat progression, mechanical progression, skill progression, and character as in story progression. What purpose do these items give? We get given so much money from all the encounters that buying what we need is often not a problem. 

And come on, and checking for new gear? What did that hour really give us? An illusion of progress and control? Or did it spend our time, and make us think the game was longer? 

Mission templates:
This is something newish, differing enemies, identical interior maps, and its a big waste of time. I get so many items dumped on me, I'm constantly scrapping them for omnigel, and I've spent maybe 7-8 hours clearing out all the sidequests. The only decent ones involved actual conversation and character decision points, like the Bringing Down The Sky DLC, and you get a piece of text at the end saying

So what does all this mean? Basically, and part of it is because of the sheer cost of the games these days. People want their money's worth, and we've trained them to expect lots of fake content in these games. I don't blame any designer for doing this. 

But on PCs, and no longer. (Limbo, I'm looking at you!) 

What other examples of fake content do you know of? What are ways we can avoid fake content in our games? ",self,t5_2qimq,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/gamedesign/comments/1k536b/the_rise_and_scourge_of_fake_content/

1368502542.0,1eak2t,How to make an FPS less FPSish?,sheenius,12,3,35,"Worst title I admit so I'll start off with explaining exactly what I mean..

FPS combat with guns.. pistols.. rifles etc.. in a 3D game with a first person camera.

Examples: Counter Strike

But I don't want the game to be so much a deathmatch.

If you look at games such as The War Z and DayZ..
It's very hard to play the game with other players unless you are in a clan etc

You can't really walk up to them and start talking

Because if they want to they can just shoot you and you're dead before you can react.. It's all about who shoots first.

What you could do is make it take a more shots to kill another player.. but it would likely have the same outcome.. let's say each bullet does 10% health damage... then the player who start shooting first is likely to win the fight with 10-30% health remaining.

I also find this type of FPS combat to be very boring.. *Basically* all you do is hold your cursor over the target and spamm mouse button 1.

I much more would prefer a FPS combat if it wasn't guns they used but magic.. You can be a lot more creative then and create an interesting combat system.. Imagine for example WoW combat system if it was FPS instead of auto target.

Also

But what do you think is good ways to make an FPS with guns more interesting (more RPGish and less ""who shoots first wins"")?

Another example is Fallout 3 and FO: New vegas..
I find the combat there to be really boring.. Even tho they have realyl good hit detection to see if the bullets hit the arm/torso/right leg/left leg/head/etc.. You basically just stand there and trade hits with your target until either one of you die.. which is always the enemy because enemies don't have all those stimpacks for example.. And because the AI is really bad and doesn't take cover or anything.. just stands there and shoots/chases you if they lose 100% of line of sight to you.
But even if the AI was better it would still be pretty boring.

A fight against a mutant for example is both of us standing infront of each other and just shooting at each other for a minute, reloading, shooting.. it looks ridiculous and it's boring.

The mutant has more health and better armor but the player has lots of stimpacks and will win in the end.

Another example of a game that actually has made it accidentally interesting is Gunz.
That game would of been boring if the players didn't find a glitch witch made them jump around like ninjas all over the walls and flying around in the air by pressing 100 buttons at the same time (not easy) which makes it much harder for someone to shoot you when you are all over the place.

It's also important that it was a glitch because if it was intended they probably would have made the glitch more user friendly to do and then it wouldn't have been as interesting/skill based anymore.

But what if you want to make your FPS a bit more realistic (no super ninja powers etc).. Something that would be interesting even on a plain map without obstacles?

Edit:
Also to add
Take a turn based game like fallout 1+2.. Combat in that game was pretty boring too.. Just had to prioritize targets mostly,,False,self,t5_2qimq,1368502759.0,,True

1367853288.0,1dsnjt,[Tabletop] Untitled Space Ship Combat Game Design Document,Shadowclaimer,9,2,15,"**Premise**

To provide strategic naval combat in a 2D space environment that mimics modern/traditional naval combat. Players will deploy a variety of space ships and build customized fleets using point values to attempt to defeat their opponents.

**The Pieces**

Originally slated to be a CSG

The ships themselves have a detailed ""scheme"" on their base (See Figure 1). This layout shows color coded lines of fire

**Phases**

*Start of Game*

At the beginning of the game, player going first as Player 1) may choose a designated starting area to place their ships. Then when they are finished Player 1 may place theirs in another starting area.

*Movement*

Player 1 may then make the first move by moving each ship up to its movement value (TBD universal, see Figure 1). Instead of moving a player may opt to simply turn a ship along its turn radius, or to not do anything at all with a ship. When Player 1 has finished their moves, Player 2 may move their ships in the same way. Each ship may only be given an action once during the movement phase to turn/move/or do nothing.

*Combat*

Once both players have finished moving their ships, they may target multiple enemies, however they cannot ""split fire"" within the same arc between multiple targets. IE: Red weapons can shoot at one foe and Blue weapons at one foe, however Red cannot shoot at two separate foes. All firing for a single ship is done simultaneously and all effects resolve at the same time).

Player 1 then rolls appropriately for each ship to designate whether or not it hits, Player 2 may then make their attack declarations/resolutions.

*End of Turn*

Once both players have finished attack resolutions and the effects of combat

**Objectives**

Players may choose to play with one or more objectives to determine how to play out the game and determine a victor.

*Elimination*

Simply put

*Sector Control*

The board is designated pre-game and divided into sectors. As long as the only ships in a sector belong to the same player

*Homebase*

Each player may field a space station or planetary body with specific rules. You are the victor when your opponents home bases are destroyed and lose when yours is destroyed.

====

*Discussion*

I want combat to be moreso based on strategic placement, I'd like to avoid bigger ships getting one shot by tiny ships randomly (a feature of some tabletops I hate with a passion) so I'd like to implement a damage system/tracking system but I've hit a bit of a wall trying to find a simple way to track that.

I'd also like to consider a ""systems damage"" system, etc.).

The three potential combat systems are:

1) Roll for hit

2) Roll for hit

3) Roll for hit

I considered potentially using ""battleship"" style damage marking with pegs

I'm also open for any ideas/concepts. The universe/backstory itself are rather fleshed out and I'm moreso interested in locking in game mechanics.

Thanks for your time /r/gamedesign

The two main ""methods"" I'm looking at are:

-One action per turn

-Movement Phase then Shooting Phase

I'm sure there's a potential third+ idea of course

The other issue I could potentially foresee is the potential for ""kiting""

Just wanted to bounce ideas

Edit 1: Think I've decided. Effectively the ""alternating"" system, then Player 1 attacks, then Player 2. This method effectively allows Player 2 to see Player 1 move into position and helps offset the inherent ""first shot"" advantage. I'm also going to limit movement to a ""turn radius"".

It's a variation of an Alternate Reality Game (ARG), instead of being played as the story happens like in an ARG, it's played after the story have occurred in the real world.

This roughly explains the format: The player starts with just a SMS message from Mark Lane. From there, and live a discovery adventure just like he did. The idea is to make the player feel that he's uncovering a real case. The game is heavily based on real-world facts and news, and is highly visual. Hundreds of photos will let the player revive Mark's adventure as if he was there.

The game is still played on a computer device, but much more complex, mixed with cryptography, problem-solving, forensic work, intertwined with a strong narrative featuring a hollywood-style plot.

1. I can add powerups in levels. Currently there are no powerups such as health

2. I can add a leveling system for the multiplayer. Right now there aren't many things to unlock. I can add new guns etc. The main problem here is that not too many people play online because there aren't many people playing online. I see people searching for a match and every once in a while they will find one. Most of the time no one else is looking. The leveling system might increase the number of people playing online or it will not be used as not too many people are playing online. Not sure which direction it will go.

3. Character customizations. Right now the characters are very bland and don't have much detail. They are stick figures. I can add clothing and other accessories. Not sure how much this is going to be used.

4. Increase the depth to the gameplay. Add new types of enemies and make goal based objectives instead of just being a deathmatch.

1366482936.0,1cr5tg,Let's discuss character customization in MMORPGs,prakkus,9,4,7,"Why, but somewhere along the line developers seem to have narrowed it down into dungeons

I'd argue that character customization is content too

If you folks are willing

**Skill Customization**: This is an area that older games like Star Wars Galaxies really went in depth with, where build diversity exists, there will be an optimal build for PvE, which will then be used. This has proven true in practice, but is there a way around it?

PvE environments require what they are designed to. If certain encounters need various forms of CC, adding more planning and diversity. Again though, is that even fun? Is that really customization? 

I wonder if it's even possible to promote customization in a competitive PvE environment or if it should be left to PvP.

**Stat Customization** has similar problems. The ideal stats will always be mathed out in a PvE situation. At the same time, and to have goals to increase those specifically. The WoW approach is to have a few stats whose priority is more important depending on the class and level of gear. This doesn't really feel like customization, but on some level it is and it *can* be satisfying.

Maybe without the standard class or dps/healer/tank constructs, another obstacle?

I've mostly been questioning PvE thus far, but developers don't bother anymore. I expect balance problems, complexity problems, and the fact that it only matters for those who PvP all contribute to this, but it seems like an untapped area of content.

So if you've gotten this far

*Is it worth it to try to have an in depth skill/stat system if only PvP players will be able to make use of the customization it offers?*

*Is is possible to have an MMO where stat/skill customization matter in PvE in a way that is actually fun? How?*

*Do enough players actually enjoy that sort of customization to be worth the time to balance it?*

And then for a little fun:

*What are some stats (that could be passive, whatever) that might offer fun customization in a clever way. Bonus points if the effect can't just be mathed out.*

I'll start with some short points that are necessary to understand the problem.
    * The city the players has build will be simulated when they are offline
    * There are two types of resources in the RTS genre. Resources that are required for upkeep, food is consumed daily by units, stone is only consumed when a player erects a new building.

The space in RTS storehouses tends to be limitless

The problem that arises from this is that as time passes while a player is offline, and 1 food gets taken out, it will either be replaced by 1 stone or by 1 food, if it gets replaced by stone then you have 51 stone and 49 food, since stone wont ever get taken out unless there is player input, food will keep being taken out until the entire storehouse is filled with stone.

What kind of solutions to this problem can I implement, saying the storehouse can only ever have 50 stone an no more). I'm rather curious to hear other peoples thoughts on this.

EDIT: formatting doesn't seem to work for me

**EDIT 2: A possible solution that has come forwards from this is having containers for the upkeep resources. Containers take up slots in the storehouse and can either be full or empty, and since the players create the containers they themselves get to choose how large the reserved section of the storehouse is.**

The game is a team-based space shooter with a strong focus on micromanagement. You control a space ship

Since the game is based on multiplayer I need a model that can pay for the servers while making the game free to play. I have no interest in making a fortune.

My plan was to make the game completely free during the beta phase. For the release version I'd implement a skill system that allows a small edge in combat and introduce a very cheap premium member status that allows you to go over a certain skill cap. Everyone who participated in the beta would get the premium status for free. Since this doesn't scale well with an increasing player base

I'd like to go the Riot way selling only cosmetic content

EDIT: I'm including a more detailed game description for context.

&gt;In the ongoing fight between the forces of Blue and Red
&gt;
&gt;The warp engines shut down and you jump back to subwarp space. *Dampeners on*. *Target that shuttle*. The red shuttle starts charging his warp engines but it's too late. A pod emerges from the debris and warps in the direction of the star. Now they know where we are. You deploy your HQ and two shuttles start mining ore from a nearby asteroid. Other two shuttles start warping towards random celestials in order to scout where the Reds have deployed their base. In the meantime you start producing a scaffolding module and a factory module from the HQ. While your are locking the scaffolding with your tractor beam

I'm really sorry, nebulae and asteroid fields. Fights are short, risky, somewhat skill dependent and not that frequent. One match should last for about an hour.

EDIT2: From the feedback below that fits the game I've concluded that I should be selling monthly premium status that gives them increased leveling rate and various other small benefits like premium status icons, some less. During the beta phase I should keep my investments minimum by distributing the server software to players willing to host extra servers.

I think a big focus of ccgs is on the advancememt -- beating campaign, etc. Similar to a traditional video game.

And I want to jump a level deeper -- people love that gambling aspect (and maybe more importantly the artificial content lengthening) that comes with boosters. I don't know if its the lack of decision making involved in what to buy

I think a lot of this comes from the f2p model and playing games earns you rewards. But is it the best way? Can the reward be something other than expanding your collection? Is it a case of people not challenging the norm? Boosters are clunky in a world that doesn't suffer from physical distribution issues. Fantasy flight ditched the whole notion all together with LCGs.

The same thing could be done with cars. If you look at GTA, Ferrari, Subaru, Mercedes etc. Many cars. Why not have those models replicated in games?
Even future cyberpunk settings can benefit from this. I'm sure coca cola will be around in 10-20 years time and I doubt Adidas is going to go away. Why not have these companies virtual stores licences out to every game and let developers work on the details.
Another possibility is to have companies license out concept products to futuristic worlds. Like the nokia bendable phone or samsung's future concept products
Perhaps something can be worked out in fantasy and medieval games too. Like arrow makers or sword replica creators licence models for free in exchange for in game advertising.

I've never designed a game before, hypercognitive war AIs, each with a differing specialty, who colonize and strip a series of planets in the pursuit of complete dominance over all other sentient beings.

To describing the actual game. It takes place on a table, buildings that go onto a player's planet, and upgrades that go onto a player's AI card. The object of the game is to of course destroy all of the other players, with the ascending pile of resources that are obtained from building upgrades onto the planets. 

At the moment, and exaflops each turn. These are used to purchase and activate abilities, cards, and upgrades, as well as to squabble over planets. Each is predominantly used to purchase and activate one type of thing. Materiel is mostly used to attack. Energy is mostly used to build your planetary economy. Exaflops are used to navigate your ever-expanding deck, and to use various card actives. 

Something that's helped me to get *this* far (not too far) is to envision the type of experience I want to create for the player. What I want is a game that is fast-paced, unorthodox tactics, last-minute grand-gesture stupid ideas, and utter dickery. Player victory should be sudden, crushing, and accompanied by initial yelling followed by the slow realization of ""ahhh but I could have done this!"" It should be decently easy to learn, but I'm comfortable with the idea of there being a 30-minute learning curve or so walking in.  

Here are the things I'm having problems with:

* Turn order and ordinary action counts. This is probably the nitty gritty stuff. Each turn somebody should be able to buy something and play a card. When do they get to build stuff or play the card that they just bought? 
* I'm having some issues making combat work in a way that feels good to me, but the game is already pretty damn complicated.
* I'm not sure how to get the planet-squabbling quite hashed out either. Is it a type of bidding war? An actual war? Is it claimed? What would be the fastest and most amenable to interference
* One of the more important things to me seems like the chaos of the battlefield. I almost want to have some variety of simultaneous turn
* I feel like I'm overcomplicating things. Three resources? So many actions and actives? How many cards of each type should I shoot for to make the game playable without giving myself a huge headache?
* Is there a way for me to balance it without playing it yet? Are there any resources available on how to balance a game of this type before giving it a go
* Also

1374449665.0,1is0f1,Having trouble designing some gameplay elements in a 2.5D Metroidvania game.,Sniphles,2,0,10,"For the past few days I've been writing down gameplay ideas for a 2.5D Metroidvania game I have wanted to design for years

It's my opinion that you can't have a truly good Metroidvania game if the enemies and environments are not finely tuned around the things the player can do at that specific time. Metroid is what it is because you get an upgrade

When you get the Ice Beam in Super Metroid you quickly realize that it's what you need to get higher up in Brinstar, but also have different options in combat.

So how do you introduce a sword into that, or more attacks? How hard should it hit compared to the gun? Should it have high knock back? What kind of upgrades should it get? Should it get one where it can instantly kill most weaker enemies like the Screw Attack from Metroid?

**What if say

Possible features and rulesets:

1. The AI that came to your village will have **their own jobs and stats.** 

a. You'll be able to choose all of them for the battle with the possibility of perma-death if the AI ally doesn't survive the battle. Broken I know

b. **Their stats grow during the day**. Depends on the roles available in the village of course. ie Knights grow it stats by killing stray monsters/guard a Freeman (basic job

2. **Form of currency based on resources available**. Trade resource to ""a job board"" to entice AI from a different area coming to help your village.

3. First person/third person free movement during the day/fort building. Grid-locked during battle.

----

The Battle:

1. I'm really open to anything on this one. From a speed/agility based ruleset similar to SMT: Devil Survivor series

2. **A job vs job weakness**. Since there are abilities 1-2 for each class

3. **A battle reward**. Open to suggestion . Enticing player to look forward to the battle during the night is something hard to achieve unless they in it for the battles/fort building/city building.

----

**So what do you guys think? Yay/Nay? Any flaws I didn't consider? Or general thoughts on the idea?**

I'm planning for the AI to follow a set of ""availability schedule"" depending the time of the day (ie advance interaction with thief

1369133857.0,1er9qo,Does imagining a game idea and writing it out in detail count as pulling your own weight in the scope of a game development company?,grenas,2,2,11,"So this is what has been bothering me for a while...  
Lets say I have a 50 page document describing in detail a game. Everything about it, sound effects and the music, the main mechanics, the protagonist, NPC's, the story, the levels
Would making that count as pulling your own weight in the scope of a game development company?  
  
I mean, pygame or even construct 2 becomes tedious after a while. I know enough about music to understand and recognize a good score but I'm miles away from being able to compose  or record one. I can imagine in great detail how the game world would look and feel, but I can't draw to save my life. I grew up on games and movies so I know in general what a good story would look like, and I think I am good at constructing a storyline in a broad kind of way, but english is my second language and I don't read books that much so I can't write dialogue.  
It feels like having a great fleshed out idea doesn't mean that much if I am not able to help in the actual development.  
  
I guess what I'm asking is, artist, composer, writer, etc. would I be right in feeling that I am bringing enough to the table by just helping them to coordinate and create what I have imagined? Or should I man up and learn how to program or draw or write or whatever?",,False,t5_2qimq,True

Primarily, or Letter Press. I'm working on a side project which is a similar kind of asynchronous multiplayer game, and I'm trying to use some frames of reference to determine how long I want my games to last. This will probably lead me to coming up with a guideline for determining the power of special abilities or the nature of a possible alternate win condition to wiping out the entire team (like destroying crystals in Hero Academy). I don't want to ask this question in the context of days or real time, since you'll never know how many days it'll take for a player to respond to your turn.

At the title screen

At this dojo you have the ability to script combo moves. Most likely this will need to be an unlock at some point in the game. At the beginning it wouldn't make sense for a user to script any moves because he hasn't got far enough where combo moves would be useful.

So lets say half way through the game

You can take all the basic punch moves, speed up etc... to each move. You can have your character pull out guns, knives, swords, etc... they can throw the items... think garrys mod but more confined. Not the ability to do anything but allow the user the illusion of freedom of choice. 

Essentially it is a minecraft for action games. You give the users the tools to build their own experience.

You could also limit the amount of movements

Maybe you could even apply the freemium model to this... making users pay for the ability to customize their combos. I don't know the sky is the limit... but I feel like this could be really cool if executed... even if you executed it poorly...
