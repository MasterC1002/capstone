1291000783.0,ed4gs,Why I am AWESOME at Call of Duty: Black Ops,checkmarshall,478,74,103,"1. If you need legs or feet shot to shit

2. They might as well have a class specifically for me called ""Special Insurgent"" because I spawn right where all the other players seem to be in the middle of killing my teammates. I usually shoot enough bullets at their feet that they notice me right away though.

3.  I have magic bullets. No, I know you just killed my teammate, but now your bullets can head my way!""

4. Dogs fucking love me. I will be around 2 or 3 of my teammates... but when dogs are around... its like they don't even exists. Those bitches love to jump up and fuck my face until I die.  

5.  I constantly throw my body in front of my teammates to save their lives. Even when the shooter doesn't see me

6.  Im like the mother fucking bomb squad in this game. Plant a claymore and I will hunt that bitch down and chuck my goofy ass on that bitch. I dont care if you plant that son of a bitch in the back corner of the map. Call me mine sweeper. 

7. Need one more kill for your kill streak? Dont worry Ill weaken someone up just so you can get the final shot and claim the kill. Its cool... Ill be dead already anyway. It must be fucking sweet shooting people from that chopper. 

8. Pretend to be dead by going prone

9.  Who needs radar? I run around for minutes at a time not getting killed by ANYONE! Who the fuck cares that the battle is happening on the other side of the map? Im hanging out in this mother fucking tree house getting my camp on... someone is bound to run by this window. 

10.  Bet you didnt know you could drown in this game? Fuck yeah you can.. I did and Im awesome.

1298995682.0,fv407,Quick tips for pro-ing perks,SouthernFriedChicken,169,41,44,"Just thought that I would give a few quick tips for getting as many perks ""pro-ed"" as possible. All of these can be found in various sources within this subreddit

Tier 1
-----

* **Lightweight:** Knife / escape death / offense medals

* **Scavenger:** Resupply / Scavenged grenade kills / 5 kill without dying X 5

* **Ghost:** Spyplane kills / shoot down 30 aircraft / destroy enemy sentry gun

* **Flak Jacket:** Survive explosions / plant or defuse 10 bombs / throw back grenades

* **Hardline:** Share packages / 7 kills without dying / 7 kill streaks 

Tier 2
-----

* **Hardened:** Kill through wall / 200 bullets into aircraft / 1 equipment through wall

* **Scout:** Secondary weapon kills / 1 shot kills / head shots

* **Steady Aim:** Knife kills (2 in 5 seconds) / Hip fire kills / Kills after sprinting

* **Sleight of Hand:** ADS kills / Kill enemy within 5 seconds of reloading / injure-reload-kill

* **Warlord:** Two attachment kills / Grenade kills / Multi grenade kill

Tier 3
------

* **Tactical Mask:** 20 kills after flash/concuss/nova

* **Marathon:** 26 miles / First blood / CTF X 15

* **Ninja:** Silenced kills / back-stab / Plant bomb

* **Second Chance:** 10 kills in 2nd Chance / Revenge while in 2nd chance / headshot

* **Hacker:** Destory enemy equipment / 25 kills by C4 or claymore / 25 kills within radius of jammer or motion sensor

The Plan
--------

Several of these perks are great to pro together.

**Combo 1:** Flak Jacket / Steady Aim / Ninja

* Steady Aim and/or Sleight of Hand should be pro-ed as soon as possible. They are probably the most versatile perks for all class-types. Just play the game and you will usually complete the challenges naturally. If and when you come to the final challenge of SoH, hide and reload, and then finish them off. This might be easier to do in demolition, but I don't want to suggest potentially letting them plant the bomb.

* FJ and Ninja are perfect combos in that they both share the same challenge: plant 10 (15 in FJ's case) bombs. You can usually do this in 3-4 games depending on how aggressive you are.

* Just make sure your gun is silenced (depending on your level, and you should be able to naturally complete all but the grenade throwback challenges.

* For the grenade throwbacks

**Combo 2:** Scavenger / Warlord / Tactical Mask

* Another great combo for pro-ing these three perks. Scavenger and Warlord both place a lot of emphasis on grenade kills

* Scavenger is largely pro-ed naturally, so that any grenade you have while playing is scavenged. Play domination, and learn those nade throws. I prefer semtex, but only because I have become comfortable with how far I must be from a flag to nade it (as well as not having to cook the grenade)

* Once you Scav/Warlord pro-ed, you will complete these pretty quickly (especially in Nuke Town).

**Combo 3:** Hardline / Sleight of Hand / Second Chance

* Not as compatible a combo as the previous two

* Also, and killing them. If you are killed while reloading, you can often complete this challenge by finishing them off in 2nd chance. I know this perk is frowned upon here, so just don't tell anyone;)

* For sharing packages, at least, doesn't require you to radically change your play style.

**Combo 4:** Lightweight / Scout / Marathon

* All of this should be playing CTF. Never stop running.

* Secondary should be ballistic knife. Use Steady Aim instead of Scout until you get the 2 kills in 5 seconds. Then switch to Scout and start getting secondary kills.

* Once you have gotten your knife kills for lightweight, though in my experience flag runners just run and pray. This will make hitting the upper body easier as they are running away from you instead of across.

* If you miss them

* The lightweight/marathon challenges are relatively self explanatory. For first blood

**Combo 5:** Ghost / Hardened / Hacker

* I save ghost for last

* Hacker will help ghost locate the sentry gun

* Hacker will also help you complete your hardened equipment challenge

* If you pro ghost before hardened

* Using a motion sensor

* For hacker, but if you want to ""think less,"" just go for claymore, and make sure you always have one planted each time you spawn.

Advice from posters
-------------------

**downwithlevers**

* To get 5 throwbacks for **FJ Pro**, camp, whatever. Your KDR will go to shit while you're doing it (if you care) but you'll get those throwbacks quicker than the crow's nest in my experience at least.

* To get those first bloods quick for **marathon**, you can easily run down the hill and to the right towards B, sit behind the red barrels, and kill dudes coming down the hill directly ahead. Works 99% of the time.

* If you're having trouble getting the multi-kill for **Warlord Pro**

* Here's a tip for **Tac Mask Pro** that took me forever to realize on my own. You don't have to kill the guy with your nova gas directly. He just has to be affected by your nova gas and then die. So toss some gas at the enemy and once you get that gas hit marker

* For **Hardline Pro**

**kungpu**

* Easiest way to get the **backstabber** is to camp near the the bomb in demo (Ghost helps) and wait until someone comes to plant. Once you hear the buttons you jump out and pull a sneak attack from behind, I must have knifed at least 6-7 players in the backtrying to plant that bomb.

**ripthatbong**

* I found getting the **Offense Medals with Lightweight** easy in CTF as well

**JPsmooth42**

* If you are going for **Tac Mask Pro**

**Final edit:** Just hit the max characters. No more user inputted suggestions. Check the comments!",self,t5_2rq1o,True,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/codbo/comments/fv407/quick_tips_for_proing_perks/

Step One: Get to Lvl 50 and by now you should have quite a lot of money

Step Two: Do some warm-up matches in the Wager Matches lobbies. I prefer doing Gun Game matches in the ""Ante Up"" and then ""Weekend Gambler"" lobbies because it really seems like the only Wager Match where you can be consistent IMO.

Step Three: Once you have a good feel for the rotation of games and have won a couple of games find a ""High Roller"" lobby of Gun Game.

Step Four: When the map is locked make sure you ""Double Down"" first (just in case people Double Down) and then hit the Prestige button.

Step Five: Wreck Shit in the game

Step Six: Profit

Really you don't have to win to make a lot of money

TL;DR:   Prestige in Wager Match Lobby to start off with a lot of money in case you win.

1. Let's face it, but by being bad, their stats (read: K/D) had gone beyond salvageable, and it was impossible to bring back up.

2. Players that had been in CoD before MW2 were introduced to an epic error/shitstorm of a game. Good players found themselves decidedly average in the face of OMA tubing and Commando. Their ability to have good games likely took a dip as well. Anyways

3. Black Ops comes out! No more shitstorm! I can have a good K/D again! Scream the old players from before MW2. Now I too can have a good K/D, the safest way to get good games is to camp. Therefore, people camp in corners and get good gameplays. Sure, their K/Ds go up, but they feel unfulfilled

4. Black Ops becomes trite to these players. Same camp spots, day out. Campers get bored even though they are good. The sheer amount of camping turns Black Ops into a totally defensive game overall. People who don't play defensively hate the game because they keep getting killed by the same campers in the same camp spots. Variety and Fun get flushed down the toilet.

5. People are afraid to leave their comfort zone, people are afraid to leave their comfort zone.

1298700789.0,ft1yd,How to be a better teammate. Please add your knowledge!,ViralRiot,83,5,58,"Alright everyone, here we go:

**GENERAL**

* Be mindful of doorways or small entrances. You can unknowingly be blocking a teammate trying to cut off an enemy you're unaware of


* If you're using Second Chance Pro


* Is your teammate prone or sniping or BOTH? You probably shouldn't stand in front of them or around them firing your weapon like it's a damn middle eastern wedding.


* Notice a teammate using Ghost? If you can help it


* When I'm playing with randoms


* Don't change other people's care package unless they ask you to.


* If a teammate drops a care package




**DOMINATION**


A lot of the times I play DOM


* When capturing a point that has more than one way of attack


* Going prone isn't always the best option when capturing. It's important that you're able to move in case of an incoming semtex/frag/gas grenade. Also, you will catch them sprinting down the hill and you get an easy kill.


* Flak Jacket Pro is essential to Domination. Let people complain about Ghost all they want, and let's face it, Claymores are the only reason you use Hacker anyway. Now you can capture flags with ease. Desperation nades won't kill you and now you can't get gassed or flashed.


* Use your mini map!! I can't stress this enough. If you find that you have the majority of the flags, look at where your team is and get there quick. Capturing points is quick and easy with 2+ people on the flag.


* Don't just stand there, it's A LOT more helpful to your team to get on that point! You capture it faster, and if the enemy picks off you or your teammate, you or your teammate is still there to finish the cap.


* Remember that time and place I was talking about? Here it is. In wide open points like Flag B on WMD, or the sandbags. Coming from C, you should provide cover from the L-Catwalk or the red warehouse. If you don't have smoke, then get on the point with your teammate. DO NOT throw smoke down in close quarters points. It makes it impossible to kill incoming defenders. Remember, all they have to do is run in guns blazing. So many times I see people throw down smoke on Firing Range. This is just stupid. It doesn't help.


* COMMUNICATE. Seriously you'd think this is common sense, I'm only saying that you may need to be more specific.


* Keep an eye flag markers. Sometimes the game won't announce the flags are being taken and it's easy to miss when you're focusing on defending a point. If you're dug in pretty well on a certain point


* Killstreaks! It's been repeated on this board time and again, Sentry Gun, Mortars, Napalm Strike, and Black Bird are the killstreaks you're gonna want to look into. Having just one of those is helpful enough.



**DEMOLITION**


A lot of what I mentioned in my DOMINATION section is also applicable here. There are a few additions however.


* For God's sake cover the bomb planter/defuser. So many times I've been defusing the bomb and a teammate comes and prones out right next to me with his face shoved into the bomb site. If you see a teammate defusing/planting, stay with your teammate and cover him as best you can. If you see hitmarkers, it's time to throw that LETHAL. After that, sight in and start prefiring those doors/corners/etc. You want the attention on YOU, NOT your teammate.


* Once the bomb is planted or defused, it's good to have one man on the balcony, one man on the stairs in the ally way, one man outside near the double doors leading into the bombsite, one man on the fountain near the outdoor bomb site, and the rest can do whatever. Those four points NEED to be covered. Having one man on the opposite balcony near the outdoor bomb site is also good, especially if you still have that bomb site up.


* Save your killstreaks if the round is about to end. I have honestly seen a teammate throw a Chopper Gunner or Black Bird up right before the round ends. Save those killstreaks for the next round.


* Chopper Gunner is AMAZING for Demolition. You can practically ensure a victory for your team if you save a Chopper Gunner until your team plants both bombs. Throw it up and it's in the bag. If you're defending


* Napalm Strike is also a valuable killstreak. You're not going to want to lay it down on the bomb site however. You want to make a line that the enemy can't pass. Make them take another route. Even better


* Gas those choke points! I just got my ass handed to me by a well coordinated team on Discovery because they planted catwalk bomb site and just chucked gas at that bridge. My team got bogged down and that was just more precious seconds wasted. If you're not a fan of gas


* Noob Tubing goes a long way. By no means should you spam your M203. They are precious and should only be used if you see an enemy about to plant/defuse and they are hiding behind the bomb site.


* Flak Jacket and Tactical Mask are also recommended for this gametype. You make yourself a lot harder to kill that way and it has saved me tons of times while I am defusing or planting.




**CAPTURE THE FLAG**


* When playing CTF and your team has got the flag


Also


Side note: A good way to rank up lightweight to pro is to hold the enemy flag and get kills. Offense medals every time.

[**Sound**](http://imgur.com/yxnsS)  
Whether you like it or not sound plays a huge factor into how well you can perform during matches. Being able to hear which direction enemies are coming from or shooting you from makes all the difference in the world. If you have a nice surround sound system in your gaming area
  
  
  
[**Controller**](http://imgur.com/ggWro)  
[Kontrol Freek](http://www.kontrolfreek.com/) thumb stick Mods are a $10 investment which can significantly improve your Aiming accuracy as well as place your thumbs in a more ergonomically/comfortable position. It takes a day or two to get used to the change, you don't want to be caught with a low battery in the middle of a gun fight. Don't eat greasy foods or Cheetos while playing, especially if you're using my controller.  
   
   

   
**HUD/Safe Area**  
In the options menu you run across an option known as [**Safe Area**](http://imgur.com/RHw0G). Safe area effects the the positioning of your radar
   
* [**Max Safe Area**](http://imgur.com/TOpTV) = [**Further**](http://imgur.com/3gJgp) from the center 
* [**Min Safe Area**](http://imgur.com/2Mc93) = [**Closer**](http://imgur.com/mfyKgl) to the center  
  
Now for smaller TV/Monitors (Under 24'') this might not make a difference
  
   
**Look Sensitivity**  
An obvious adjustment. If you haven't experimented with your look sensitivity you may be heavily hindering your abilities while playing. An average sensitivity falls in the range of 4-5. Enter a combat training match with easy bots. Start at high sensitivity like 6 . Run around and gather up kills. Even if this seems really fast you want to try it out for a good 5 minutes. From there adjust either lower or higher. Higher sensitivities take some time to get used to but can have big pay offs if you can get use to them. If you're pigeon-holed at a lower sensitivity try increasing it by 1 and play for a night
   
  
  
[**TV Distance**](http://imgur.com/NObWm)    
Depending on how good your eyes are or aren't you might want to adjust how far or close you sit to the TV. I use a 32'' TV and sit about 7ft away from it in a computer chair. If you are gaming in a living room instead of sitting on the couch
  
  
  
**Hand/Arm Positioning**  
This one might be a little weird to explain. When I play

**What is NAT?**

NAT (acronym for Network Address Translation) is a methodology employed by your router to translate requests from the internet and route them to the appropriate device.

Most of you should at least have heard the term IP address - it's the unique address provided to each device connected to the internet. IP addresses range from 0.0.0.0 - 255.255.255.255 (why 255.255.255.255? Because the current IP protocol uses 32-bit addressing, 192.168.x.x is reserved for private networking), others reserved for various reasons which are irrelevant here.

But there's a catch - after allocation, so how did we work around this?

Meet NAT. In the internet world, every consumer router assigns a private IP address in the 192.168.x.x range to each device connected to it. When outgoing connections are made, the router makes a note in the NAT table which device sent the request and to where. When the response is received, the router uses the NAT table to determine who it should be routed to. Ta-da!

**Why does NAT affect my Black Ops gameplay?**

Sometimes, you may receive packets before you send a request. If a router receives a packet of data and it doesn't correspond with an entry in the NAT table, the router will not know what to do with the packet of data and simply 'drop' it, never making it to its intended destination. If these sorts of issues occur, then it may become impossible to join in certain parties, play in certain games or even join games with a specific person.

**My NAT is Closed/Moderate! What do I do?**

You'll need to log into your router and setup **Port Forwarding**. A list of ports you need to open are below:

**Xbox 360:**

* TCP Ports: 53
* UDP Ports: 53

**PlayStation 3:**

* TCP Ports: 80, 3074, 5223
* UDP Ports: 3074

**Windows PC:**

* TCP Ports: 3074
* UDP Ports: 3074

Unfortunately since there are many different routers I can't outline a step by step process to setup port forwarding as everyone's will be different. Check the documentation that came with your router or your router manufacturer's website - it will have the step by step instructions you'll need.

That's it! Enjoy your less-lag faster-joining Black Ops gameplay.

**Wait! What if this doesn't work for me?**

1. Know the difference between camping as opposed to holding down an area. Camping, over and over. Holding down an area is more or less running a circle around a hot spot. Watching XboxAhoy videos really helps clarify this, but for example, the area on Havana with the bar is a great perimeter to hold down.


2. If one dude keeps killing you


3. Fucking talk, if you don't have a mic, you'd want a guy calling shit out. But, if you do have the privilege of mic and even better, so do your mates, make *sure* you're communicating and take advantage of this. It is absolutely essential, especially if you get some decent opponents.


4. Since we're on the subject of mics. Sometimes I wonder if people on Xbox Live understand what exactly a mic is, just mute him, and for damn sure, don't engage him (at least not in argument). You can mute individual players in game by checking the scoreboard, using the d-pad to get to their name and pressing X. Out of game muting is more of a self-explanatory process.


5. Classes. Make them congruent, all three compliment the other making your character overall advantageous. Of course the obvious one, Ghost/Scout/Ninja with a suppressor/motion sensor makes a shit load of sense. In essence, a poor loadout is one where the complimenting of equipment/classes/perks is absent.


6. If you're opposed to my #1 and consider ""holding down an area"" just as campy as simply sitting there


The last rule, if you encounter your opponent and barely dodge into cover, do not come back out 1 second later, you *will* die. The superior option, imo, is to try to get behind them, jump through a window or w/e, in a reflex battle  against these 11 year olds

The second rule(s) of one on one fights. First of all, unfortunately, strafing will seldom save you, but if you do strafe avoid the obvious direction. If you see someone while running right, don't keep running right while engaging, rather, as soon as you start the engagement dip left, mother fucking LAY DOWN. This is the biggest thing for me in almost every engagement, so timing your laydowns right takes a little practice.


But yeah that's all I can think of right now. Hope I helped some newbies


Killed a solid hour at work w00t!

*TL;DR* 

*Hold down area but don't camp

*Ignore the camper

*Communicate as much as you can

*Make friends with the mute button.

*Make classes congruent

*Circle the map

*Get low in one on one engagements

Do I think that they are perfect? Absolutely not.Could they have done better? Hard to answer for I don't know how exactly such large-scale gaming works but I would say that yes

Everyone is worried about their little e-peens and how many kills they can get with how few deaths. Now in TDM and DM that's the point yes

I have had to leave CTF servers because no one on my team would defend the flag. Well

You see while they had 0 caps and 0 returns

I've gotten 90 and 100 kill scores, defending them, being the first one to charge in so we can take a bomb site, you know playing the GAME. Where as in many an SnD, or Demolitions, or HQ the ""top"" 3 players on the team were more than happy to let us lose every HQ, or the bomb to go off

So let's make it simple, how many HQs they've captured or destroyed, successful plants, just don't let them pad their stats.

In fact don't even record that at all, and would only improve gameplay.

For example if you are in a game for under 20% of the total play time you shouldn't get a win or loss.

A lot of people on this subreddit seem to have the following argument:

&gt;I don't get all the hate towards campers! I mean

1. Pretend for a moment that you're on a 10 killstreak and that you're one kill away from your beloved puppies. You're in beast mode! You're breaking jaws and making laws and kicking ass and taking names! You're certain that those pooches will be dining on enemy flesh! THEN... out of nowhere, only to find out that the guy had been aiming down his sights well before you even entered the equation. Yea... he's a sitting duck and yea, you can return for the revenge kill... but that's not a worthy compensation. Why? Because your killstreak is over. One kill isn't going to bring that back.

2. Pretend for a moment that you're playing a FFA game and that there are 9 players (including yourself). Now pretend that you are the only person who is playing aggressively. You're the type of guy who is out for some fast-paced fun. You want gun fights and lots of one on one confrontations. However, but they're wearing Flak Jacket. You try to attack via the main entrance, but they're lying prone and aiming down their sights. You try to sneak up on them but they've got the motion sensor and you don't have Hacker Pro. The entire gameplay has been slowed down. It's not a fast-paced arcade FPS anymore; it's a mind-numbing game of hide and go seek. There are no one on one confrontations. There is no excitement. The game ends and you win; but you barely managed to scrape 20 kills in 10 minutes.

3. Beyond campers who are actually new to the game and don't know their way around the maps, but because of his motives. ",,False,self,t5_2rq1o,False,360,

A few issues spring to mind:

- The subreddit stylesheets have a limit. This means that we can't append everyone's gamertag/id to their reddit username.

- Even if you do get your GT appended to your username, because of time differences and (more importantly) latency issues.

- ""Hook-up threads"" are ok. i.e. somebody posts a thread saying ""Hey guys, in the sense that your ""Hook-up"" thread might only get seen by a small set of people.

- Different people prefer different game modes and playlists. You may be in the same location as another Reddit

- Some people don't like talking over their mics. Others do.

So

- Platform
- Location/Timezone
- Games (MW2

First

The best thing to do, making sure to note that you are from reddit.

A second method is to go on IRC, let's you realtime chat with others on the channel. I feel tat this is probably the absolute best way to contact people, however there are very few people on IRC and I frankly find it quite disappointing.

A method for XBOX LIVE users (if this exists on PS3 please alert me) is to send a friend request to the XBL accounts: ""redditors"" or ""redditCODBO"" you don't have to be accepted to view the friend list of either of these two accounts

I hope this helps.

EDIT: Added some tips from the comments

My KDR is 2.9 million to 1, anything that will help me camp my ass off to the MAX! 

2: I got me some Second Chance. Hell yea motherfucker!! Sure, I don't have to worry about winning gunfights. Hell, I don't even try to shoot first anymore! I just wait until I land on my ass and then let my pistol rip. 

3: I started using the RC Car. Seriously. Spy Planes are for chumps who like to appease their team mates. Chamberlain tried to appease a man once: His name was Hitler! Why would I use a stupid spy plane when I can drive an annoying-ass remote control car around the map? I can even camp and drive that bitch at the same time. Hahaha! My team mates? They can all get cancer and die. It's not my fault that they've decided to capture flags and plant bombs.

4: When I'm playing Domination, yea, yea, I know, I should go and play FFA or TDM or something because they're kill-based game modes. But you know what? Fuck that. I killwhore in Domination because the enemy players are far too concerned with the objectives to come and stop me. Got a problem with that? Yea? Well too bad, because I can't hear you over the sound of my dogs! Wait... why you so mad bro? I was only defending the flags! pppppffffctttthhhhhhhht

5: If you are within a five mile radius of me, I just spam the knife button along the way. You know. Just in case somebody appears in front of me.

I’ve chosen what I feel were questions that were relevant and actually provided some new or important information. I’ll be splitting up the questions into the general section and the PC section because, it only makes sense to divide up the questions. There were several occasions where the moderator had to remind people to ask gameplay

*General*


im unsure about the reporting a cheat feature
&gt; So


Is there any new features or changes to the online network that will either improve connection quality or make it easier for friends to play with each other?
&gt; Many to help you play with Friends. All versions of the game have a built in Friends list


How long we need for lvl50 (Playtime)
&gt; It's tuned for about 24 hours of playtime. The best players in the building can do it in 20 or 21. Make sure you do the Challenges and it goes quick.


Will ""spawn-tubing"" (firing a grenade launcher from one team's spawn to the other) be changed
&gt; One of our tier 1 perks is called Flak Jacket. It protects you from explosive damage. I roll with this perk all the time to frustrate noob tubers. As to spawn tubing... we've added a grenade launcher and grenade delay to the beginning of every match. So even if people fire them


Can you give us any total numbers for the amount of guns, emblems or anything else that would be cool to know?
&gt; We have over 40 unique weapons, 14 maps... I could go all day on numbers. Custom red dots are about 30-35


Are there any special bonuses for prestiging in black ops?
&gt; Many. Custom Classes. Colored Clan Tags. 15 bonuses. 1 for each of the 15 prestige levels. Including some unique backgrounds for your personalized emblem. Including one that so hot your keyboard would catch on fire if I told you what it was. Guess you'll have to get to level 15. Prestige level 15


Are you guys planning on supporting Black Ops as much as World at war in the terms of DLC?
&gt; We will absolutely support Black Ops DLC after launch. We plan on promoting the game post-launch this time even more than on World at War.


If you do a lot more damage to an enemy will you get more points for the assist like in WaW or is it a set assist score no matter what?
&gt; Yeah


Do all weapons have gold camo and what does it take to unlock gold camo?
&gt; All primary weapons have gold camo. As to what it takes to unlock them... you'll have to Prestige to find out!


Will Black Ops have a Coop campaign similar to World At War? 
&gt; Two forms of co-op in Black Ops. Combat Training (play vs Practice Dummies) and Zombies (play with your friends). Both are games where you fight AI + Campaign co-op wasn't something we decided to persue because it didn't make sense for the type of story we were trying to tell.


What other than score will be visible through the leaderboards?
&gt; We actually totally ditched the old leaderboard systems and started over. In Black Ops, and all-time leaderboards. This has a lot of advantages because it doesn't reward just the players who play alot, but those who play the best. You can still check all those stats that were in the old leaderboards + in something new we have called the Combat Record. It's an in-game stats viewer.


Do headshots matter
&gt; We certainly have a hit multiplier for the head. So


Will there be a votekick feature (console
&gt; It depends on the server but the vote kick feature works for PC. How we do that for OFFICIAL RANKED we are still kicking around (on/off by default) Unrented Rank will be admin controlled/option. Consoles do not have a vote kick. They do, you don't have to kick someone.


will friends be able to join a started zombie game if someone leaves?
&gt; You can't join a Zombie game in progress.


Is there going to be a game list where players can see and join custom games or does the creator have to invite people?
&gt; When you create a Custom Game, Clips, &amp; Screenshots.


Is TWar back in codbo?
&gt; I've previously announced that WAR will not be returning to Black Ops. We talked about it a lot. We fought about it even more. In the end


In Theater Mode you can record gameplay..but can we also record others voices through there mic (IN-GAME CHAT)
&gt; No, and even if we wanted to do it, there is no technical way to pull it off on the consoles yet.


For the Fmas is there a burst fire mode?
&gt; No.


Will information gathered from multiplayer be used to trend information on weapons, etc? For example a combination of weapons and perks becomes unblanced, will this be easily visable?
&gt; We have all new analytics this game. We can track popularity. Rank progression. We have the best tools we've ever had for seeing how the game is working in the real world


*PC*


what server settings can we change on a ranked server on the pc side?
&gt; I saw a recent version of RCON. It's a lot of settings for both rented ranked and even more for unranked. I am working with @pcdev to get the FAQ updated.


is FOV changeable in the pc version?
&gt; Yes it is. The last time I looked at it personally you could take it to 80.


Unranked or Ranked for tatical realism servers on the pc?
&gt; For a PC gamer


Is there a way to remotely kick people?
&gt; Yes


How will wager matches work on the PC? will it use dedicated servers that are up by Treyarch? if so
&gt; We have officially ranked Wager Match servers. Once the 6 fill up


Will PC users be able to edit their MP configuration?
&gt; You can edit the same configs that you've always been able to edit


Can we create mixed playlists such as CTF and S&amp;D on the same ranked server?
&gt; You can tell the server which base Playlist and then you can do exclusions. So as long as we have a playlist with mixed modes


So what time do you think mod tools will be released?
&gt; No ETA on mod tools release yet....


Is there now an answer to the Max amount of players we can have in Ranked and unranked servers on PC?
&gt; Current player counts are set to 18 players max on ranked and 24 on unranked


Any possibility of downloading some of the game files before release on Steam?
&gt; I am getting word that pre-load for Steam is going up ASAP. The servers might be a bit ""crowded.""


What weapons can we use on unranked servers?
&gt; You can play with all weapons on your unranked servers... ranked is where you'll experience the full rank progression of competitive play.


You said wager matches are hosted by Treyarch 
&gt; Ok. So


Will leaning return in the PC version? 
&gt; Yes. On Q and E by default with a procedural lean. It looks great and works really great in hardcore modes if you ask me.

As you already know - the Call of Duty subreddits have always been fragmented into separate subreddits, having a main r/CallofDuty subreddit as the gateway to these other subreddits means that COD-playing Redditors will no longer have to travel from subreddit to subreddit like nomads in the desert. It also means that we have a place to discuss everything about about the series. See a cool Call of Duty 2 video? Want to discuss where the series is heading? Looking for a place to discuss COD 4 strategies? 

Another great advantage of this ""central hub"" is that it unites all Call of Duty players under one banner i.e. The guys from r/mw2

Make sure that you pay [r/CallofDuty](http://www.reddit.com/r/CallOfDuty/) a visit. We're still working on the design of the subreddit.

8-9-11
Best killstreaks for the perfect Dogs setup. A lot of people like to use the spy plane, and it keeps you glued to the minimap waiting for the next ping. Not to mention that the Blackbird will help you close out your killstreaks much quicker. I really like the blackbird because I'm a horrible closer in my killstreaks (not as much getting to 10, DEATH, then yelling profanities at your television). I'll discuss why the chopper gunner in the next part:

Chaos Strategy (the 9-11)
You just got your Chopper Gunner, I'm a doctor. Instead, wait for your last two kills to come in. If they don't, you always have the chopper gunner. If they do...time to implement Chaos. Call both the Attack Dogs and the Chopper Gunner in at the same time. Guess what? The enemy has nowhere to hide. Everyone trying to shoot down your chopper gunner will be hunted by your dogs and everyone trying to take out your dogs will be shot up by your chopper gunner. Now for getting your teammates to help you.

Operation Lassie (Follow the Dogs)
Tell your teammates to follow the dogs. Simple enough. The dogs are like homing missiles which zone in on an enemies location and hunt them down by using raycasts and possibly A* pathfinding algorithms! Just tell your teammates to follow the suckers

* Suppressors reduce the range before damage drops off, where it would start drop off to 10 damage. The exception is sniper rifles, which drop from 70 damage to 50 damage at all ranges.

But, but that's kind of the point. 

Case in point: I was terrible with the knife. Always have been. I always got beaten to the punch or I was fruitlessly swinging in mid-air while being gutted. I set up combat training, I usually get at least 3 knife kills a game. Which is a vast improvement on zero. I swear, if you added all the previous COD games I've played together, I'll bet I've never gotten more than 15 knife kills TOTAL. Like ever. You can see where I'm going with this. Suck at the sniper? Use it exclusively in combat training. Pistol? Launchers? Yeah, whatever you feel weak with, play a few games in combat training and you'll find yourself doing significantly better in real online play. 

If you are cowering, in Combat Training you can run around more and get acquainted with the maps without the fear of letting down your teammates. It's a great way to get acquainted with the maps consequence free. 

Finally I will say, which while not ""rapage"" was unthinkable only a few days ago.

TLDR: Combat Training is a great way to work on your weaknesses in a consequence-free environment. ",self,t5_2rq1o,True,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/codbo/comments/e9uti/to_those_who_suck_and_think_they_cant_get_better/

* Lobby set to 'Local Only'
* NAT Open.
* Xbox connected direct to the modem (Ethernet)
* Playing late at night when I knew would be less sharing the contention on line to the exchange.
* What I thought was a good connection (about 8mb down 1mb up).

No matter what I tried I would rarely get more then three bars.

Not being prepared to accept this and getting more angry with consistently seeing kill cams show someone about half a second in front of me

I found a forum around my ISP provider 'sky uk' and a thread on ping time. The suggestion was that most ISP's have 'profiles' that they set for users. The typical standard out of the box profile set is with more download speeds in mind then 'ping time' and ping time is the one you really want for gaming. Apparently it was explained that if you called your ISP explicitly state to them your primary use the connection is for online gaming and you need a better ping

So I phoned to my ISP's broadband customer services. I got a lady on the phone who seemed to know just what I needed. She did some tests and put me on hold. After 2 minutes she came back and said try now....

I still have the results:

Looks like we got somewhere!

Next I loaded Black OPs and went into ground war (normally bad ground for me). I got 4 solid bars!

I have now played about 10 games and each one - bang! 4 bars. I am even doing better in the game itself and it seems playing at a disadvantage has now made me a better player now I have an equal ground to others.

Granted this may not be for everyone..I just thought I should put this up as if it helps someone as much as it has me

** EDIT **

Bit more research...Seems there are also two modes with a DSL line: [interleave or fastpath](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fastpath#Interleaving_and_fastpath)..

Interleaving is an error correction protocol that is implemented on your line at the DSLAM (Digital Subscriber Line Access Multiplexer - these are the baby's they have at your local exchange which connects all the lines to the internet backbone). The good thing about Interleaving is it can notify your router of bad packets. The largest drawback to Interleaving is that it will increase your ping time

FastPath allows the DSLAM to pass the data received from you to the first hop router without performing any error correction. As a result, especially to the first hop router. 

With online gaming you are not so concerned with the volume and rate at which you can pull down data

I have a suspicion I may have had this changed and perhaps the routing. 

It's worth a try even if we don't know the specific details as your ISP has probably had to think about this a few times before when other gamers have called up. You can always mention politely that its bothering you to the point that you are considering changing ISP - may give them a bit more incentive to tweak your connection.

Are parties more consistent i.e. have the difficulties with joining games with your friends and being booted for no reason been fixed?

Ninja Pro- have you noticed significant change in sound levels?

Lastly- sniping. Are we noticing ""easier"" kills? 

EDIT:

**There are also new contracts**

**I feel your pain my PS3 brothers


EDIT 2:

SOmeone asked for details of the patch. Here you go:

Issues Addressed:

    * Resolved several issues with parties getting disbanded unexpectedly.
    * Additional measures to prevent the “Transmission error” and other disconnects. This was most likely to occur with large parties where party members had mixed NAT types. (PS3 only)
    * Addressed an issue with VOIP icons not appearing when USB headsets were plugged in prior to game launch. (PS3 only)
    * Updated handling for UPnP-enabled routers to improve matchmaking conditions where users had strict or moderate NAT types. Also added in-game communications so that all players are aware of their NAT type in the Player Match party lobby.
    * Addressed issue that prevented the “Load MP by Default” option from saving when other specific option combinations were set. (Xbox 360 only)
    * Prevention of exploit that allowed players to keep custom classes and killstreaks after prestige.
    * Addressed an issue where Flak Jacket Pro would not always protect against ground fires left by Napalm Strikes.
    * Prevention of users losing their killstreak reward when switching classes at the start of a new round in round-based game modes.
    * Addressed an issue where the incorrect perks would appear when spectating another player under certain circumstances.
    * Added round start explosive delay to China Lake grenade launcher to give it the same round start limitations as other explosives.
    * Contracts will now reset when the player Prestiges.
    * Prevention of Valkyrie rocket exploding upon release under rare conditions.
    * Prevention of Gunship failing to give player full control under rare conditions.
    * Prevention of an issue where a player will get teleported outside the map boundaries under very specific circumstances.
    * Additional security measures to enhance detection and banning capabilities.

Gameplay Tuning:

    * Limit the ability to re-roll supply drops using Hardline Pro to Care Packages only
    * Added a negative influencer to all spawn points to decrease the chances of spawning near an enemy. This will further improve spawning protection on top of previous updates.
    * Additional sound mix tuning for Ninja Pro users – increased ranges and volume of enemy footsteps
    * Increased headshot multipliers for sniper rifles. Sniper rifles with suppressors equipped will now always be ensured one-shot kill headshots.
    * Subtle increase in sniper rifle accuracy when scoping in.
    * Added a render delay to the red diamond player indicators that appear when controlling the Gunship
    * Additional minor reductions in knife lunge.

1293939187.0,eus4n,ZOMBIES Advice for you guys.,JSawa,39,2,17,"I'd like to share some strategies for the BLOPS map Kino Der Toten that my buddies and I have found to work out pretty well. We typically play split screen

Kino Der Toten (Splitscreen):

**Round I:** Let the Zombies in. Shoot Zombies 2 or 3 times and then Knife. Repair **only FOUR** window panels for the max 40 points. *(NOTE: Do NOT buy any guns in the Lobby. You don't need them.)*

**Round II:** At the beginning of the round, and **MAX AMMO**.

**Round III:** It's now okay to start repairing as many windows as need be to survive. Still try to let Zombies in so you can get items. Shoot Zombies at least 8 times and then knife

**Round IV and V:** Be cautious at this point. The Zombies will start to get vicious. Shoot 8+ times and attempt to knife to survive to round five, where at the bottom of the stairs on the right will be an **MP40**. BUY this.

**Round VI-VII:** Unload as much of the pistol as you can for about 30 seconds and then use the MP40 to finish them off. Stay down at the bottom of the room with the turret. Watch your back, try it for extra points, but don't be risky. 

**DOGS should arrive at this point. My advice is to keep moving and not stay in one spot

**Rounds VIII-X:** As with the lobby, open it and book it to the stage. The stage is an OKAY place to camp for a little while, but you will definitely need to hit the power and **IMMEDIATELY buy Jugger-Nog and link up the Teleporter.**

**Rounds 11-15:** If you haven't already

BEST WEAPONS TO HAVE:

-**Ray Gun** (DOES NOT need to be upgraded until you A: Run out of Ammo or B: make it to round 20-22. This gun is massively important

-**Monkies** (Essential to have. Distracts zombies for about 10 seconds

-**HK11 and RPK Light Machine Guns** (IMPORTANT to buy QUICK RELOAD and DOUBLE TAP for these weapons. Tons of Ammo, does some hefty work.)

-**Thundergun** (DOES NOT need to upgraded until you run out of ammo and absolutely need to. PERIOD.) Essential gun to have for later rounds (30-40)

-**Assault Rifles (Commando, etc.)** These guns are NOT optimal to have in later rounds, but they are good for getting you points. I would avoid upgrading unless you feel that you absolutely need to.

OPTIONAL: **Bowie Knife &amp; Ballistic Knife Combo** (This combination allows for VERY fast knifing. It's pretty beast to have if you're quick and have jugger-nog. This will get you tons of points if you use it right. 1 hit kill up to round 11 and it's a 2 hit kill up to round 18.)

**Rounds 15-30:** I'll just provide some general tactics, SHOOT up the middle of the Lobby at as many Zombies as you can for about 5-10 seconds. **(WATCH YOUR BACK!!)** When you get flooded, do the ""Run Around"" and run up to the right of the lobby, back through the turret room, dressing room, and to the stage. (DO NOT BE AFRAID TO HIT TRAPS.)

Link up the teleporter, repeat. Each round, attempt to get a crawler so you can buy items, ammo, and close off entrances.

When you get to round 20-25, and you can't link up the teleporter, GO TO THE ALLEY WAY through the door on the right. The Alley is your last stand escape route from the Zombies and fully completes the ""Big Loop"" around the map. At higher levels, you use this Big Loop to run &amp; gun the Zombies down.

**Rounds 30+:** I call this the *""Pointman - Pointsman""* strategy. This is how we survived all the way to 45

Whichever player has the Thundergun / Zeuscannon is the POINTman. His secondary gun should be NOTHING OTHER than an UPGRADED RAYGUN. Whoever is player two is the designated POINTSman. This is what you do: 

POINTman leads the way. He protects POINTSman. He uses the RAYGUN to attempt to BLOW OFF THE ZOMBIES LEGS (ie. NOT KILL) This prevents too many zombies from spawning

POINTSman will follow POINTman wherever he goes. He will buy wall guns, and the *Ak47u* in the Alley way. POINTSman will unload as many bullets into the Zombies as possible, even though he probably won't kill them. He will get a shitton of points, and use these points to hit Electric Traps and Turrets which will slaughter tons of Zombies. (NOTE: If the coast is clear, attempt to knife and kill crawlers. BUT DO NOT STOP MOVING.

I repeat

DO NOT STOP MOVING.)

Your route will be this EVERY round:

STAGE - Linked Teleporter &gt; Pack-a-Punch Room &gt; Lobby &gt; **WALK** and Hit first electric trap in the right of the Lobby &gt; **WALK** and Hit turret trap in room with the Quick Reload &gt; SPRINT to the stage &gt; WALK to the Alley way. Remember to fuel up on ammo with the wall guns. &gt; Hit the fire trap in the room near Double Tap &gt; WALK to the lobby &gt; do the ""Run Around"" again &gt; Hit the electric trap from the dressing room to the stage. &gt; Hit teleporter &gt; Alley &gt; Lobby &gt; Link Teleporter &gt; ""Run Around"" while hitting traps &gt; Use teleporter.

RINSE WASH REPEAT. Do not stop moving. Do not get trapped. Do not get cocky. It's very very hard to kill zombies with anything other than traps at high rounds. Use Monkies sparingly. Use Zeuscannon sparingly. You WILL need it.

I'm a little sick of writing now

The visual impact of your gun being on the right makes turning to the right and strafing left easier as your fire arm holding side is visually attacking the enemy. This is purely psychological. Bullets actually come from the character model's centre

Therefore it is sometimes beneficial to strafe to your  right as you counter act the natural aim of other player to their right as they strafe to their left.

Also a large propotion of guns in Black Ops have a weighted recoil to the right, is of great advantage. It's all about missing your opponent's bullets.

It's purely situational though

Also go one way *or* the other. Never both. Your object is to escape the enemy's auto aim

1289879816.0,e6rf6,Nuketown: Tips to Keep You Alive,got_milk4,36,0,77,"This is kind of a rage post as I've yet to be able to win a game on Nuketown as no one seems to know how to play the map. I'm going to list some tips I think people should know that will hopefully make them a better player at Nuketown!

**EDIT:** People are implying that I shouldn't be giving advice, it's the fact that my teammates continually die and cost us the game.

First tip: **Defensive

There's two reasons for this, especially if you're playing with an uncoordinated team (e.g. playing with randoms). Stay back, and the other team will likely come to you. Stand your own ground, and only push forward if necessary. It seems a bit counter-productive but it will help you die less and if your team does it, win games.

Second tip: **Stay away from the middle.**

Nobody, even alone, your team will start spawning close to the enemy's current spawning position. Not only that, but napalm strikes and other assorted killstreaks will tend to be called in towards the middle of the map. The trailers and other hiding places will NOT protect you from these, whereas the houses will. Staying back means you have a closer place to take cover, not only from air support but if you've taken a few hits/need to reload. All the debris in the middle can be penetrated by bullets, and you can be gunned down behind cover. Being in the middle will get you nowhere fast *unless the other team happens to be absolutely awful*.

Third tip: **smoke

Smoke grenades are your friend on this map. If you throw them into the middle area it provides good cover to move amongst the first floor of the houses (especially the ~~garages~~ car holes). If smokes are deployed along the sides of the houses it provides decent cover from snipers who are not using an infrared scope

Fourth tip: **pass on the RC-XD.**

The RC-XD is great and all, but you can use it to spot if enemies are spawning behind you. You may not have time to react but what little time the spy plane gives you will be better than the no time at all you may have without it.

Fifth tip: **Sleight of Hand.**

This can be more of a personal preference for some, only to find yourself being gunned down during the process. Sleight of Hand will reduce that time needed greatly and let you get back into the fight faster. Couple Sleight of Hand with Scavenger and you're a one man killing machine.

These are just a few tips but they're important ones - try them and I would bet your K/D will improve and your team will stand a better chance. Obviously everyone else's input is welcome!",self,t5_2rq1o,True,,360,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/codbo/comments/e6rf6/nuketown_tips_to_keep_you_alive/

**Search Features**

When it was first launched, a bug in the advanced search feature had reared its ugly head and forced me to take the entire thing down. Basically, the search feature was showing duplicate results. Fortunately, I managed to pinpoint the problem and fix it. This means that you can now search by:

- Platform
- Timezone
- Microphone
- Preferred Games (MW2
- Preferred Game Modes (TDM

i.e. you can now narrow down results and find Redditors that compliment your own Call of Duty gaming habits.

**Hosting**

When the site was first launched, I was forced to rewrite certain pieces of code/database queries; just because the free host in question had crappy default settings that brought the site down. Thankfully, a fellow Redditor (Reddit user [jargoone](http://www.reddit.com/user/jargoone)) was more than willing to give us free space on his hosting plan. He also registered a domain name (http://redditgaming.net) for the site. This was all done out of his own pocket, so may he bask in a million upvotes!

**Profiles**

Everyone that has submitted their details now has a ""profile"" of sorts. This profile details all of the information that you have submitted to us. In the future, Steam etc

**Login**

You can now login (using the password you registered with) and update your preferences and details. Sick of Domination? Well now

**CSS**

The app can now be used to generate CSS for Call of Duty subreddits. The feature is available to anyone who is logged in. This means that COD subreddits can now generate the CSS that shows gamertags beside Reddit usernames. I might also add in a feature that chooses people at random

It is hoped that this system can act as the hub for all Call of Duty subreddits. Also - If you have any bug reports or recommendations etc,False,self,t5_2rq1o,False,,360,t3_i35oq

The facts:

* The Kill Cam and Theater recordings reference the same data — known as a [Non-Playable Demo](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_demo#Non-playable) — and reconstruct where the Host believed entities (character models, etc…) were at intervals in time. The game renders this data to the best of its ability *without* the benefit of things like lag code to smooth things out and make them look believable.

* Kill Cams play back using the map's current state, and may cause smoke to appear invisible or nonexistent smoke to be visible during the Kill Cam.

* Due to the absence of lag correction

* It is widely accepted that Kill Cams and Theater recordings play at a lower frame rate than normal gameplay.

These four factors are responsible for *almost* as much Kill Cam Rage as lag itself

The game engine takes the known event data — player locations, equipment placement, etc… — and applies some fuzzy logic to fill in the gaps.

I define rusher here as someone that *never* camps or defends an area

* AK47u; self explanatory. Most gun fights are in its kill range

* Dual mag; you'll be getting nothing but gun kills, you're a beast. Grip = negligible; and rapid fire negates medium range ability. Extended mags is accpectable..

* Flak Jacket pro; the benefits of nigh-on complete explosive invulnerability ensures you can disregard claymores and nades

* Sleight of hand pro; in a game where 3-4 bullet kills are the norm

* Ninja pro; if you're a head set user, unplug your earphones from your mp3 player and use them. The ability to instantly locate your enemy isn't one you should ever be without.

* Semtex; rushers shouldn't be cooking 'nades

* Concussion Grenades; faster release than flash

* Claymore; forget about equipment, you kill with your gun. Every now and again the claymore you put down in an oblique corner will say +100, it'll be a bonus. Motion sensor, the only other contender as a useful equipment would mean defending an area, not for impatient kills-whores like us.

* Killstreaks; you choice, no choppers, work your way to dogs, they kill whilst you kill.

1292678415.0,enwdx,MW2 Vs. BlOps: map breakdown opinions,,43,11,58,"Here's a list of my opinions and an arbitrary rating of each of the maps shipped with both MW2 and BlOps

It's all subject to preference although I've tried to remain objective in most cases. High ratings are given for innovation, and empahsis on variance in tactics of play. 

I'm at home with my xbox at university

My thoughts:

**MW2**

* **Afghan** - excellent all round map based around perimeter play, but overall had enough varied cover points and counter points to keep it interesting, 8/10

* **Derail** - far too big, SnD became a game of who had the biggest balls to run the furthest, all other game types became a cluster fuck for the centre house. Big =/= better, 3/10

* **Estate** - a fight for the centre house in most game types, it looked pretty, but  was ultimately a poor map 4/10

* **Favela** - excellent mix of interesting sight lines, one of MW2s best offerings, never got bored of it in most game types 8/10

 * **Highrise** - the perfect CoD map, which I'm sure was fun for some. How can you dislike it? Perhaps a little too symmetrical? Nah this is a classic in even the FPS genre overall, 9/10

* **Invasion** - standard CoD gridded map affair, Strike, or District from CoD4. If it aint broke... 6/10

* **Karachi** – it sounded like a vaginal euphemism

* **Quarry** – dominated by the high ground towards one corner of the map with three viable routes up to that area all with sloped ground making anybody a sitting duck, not a good design imo. Although it was a more enjoyable affair with other game types 5/10

* **Rundown** - a map not suited to many game types, too stand offish over the bridge heads, without much relief - 5/10

* **Rust**- like shipment only shit. Mainly due to the towering obstruction in the centre being too overwhelming

* **Scrapyard** - standard map four perimeter buildings and small complex in centre, nothing special 5/10

* **Terminal** - I'm sure everyone that played this agrees, and a good blend of gun fight scenarios makes this my favourite and probably that of many others 10/10

* **Underpass** - meh see Invasion
  
* **Wasteland** - one of the most hot/cold maps ever, if like me you figured out how to do well with a scar for example, you could make an entire lobby your collective bitch on this map. I'll give it a high rating for innovation, and unique layout, with realistic battleground feel 8/10

* **Sub Base** - standard affair, not much to say. Although it did provide building areas that managed not to create one superior location to camp in, so technically its design must be rather good. 7/10

* **Skidrow** - an excellent all round map, my personal favourite from this game, due to a clutch I once had in SnD ""this one time I had a clutch..."" 8/10

-----------------------------------------

**BlOps**


* **Array** – urghghgghgghhhhhhh, perhaps just a violent cough. It’s piss poor map design in my opinion. The round house is far, far too dominant. Saying that: since I now control that house, without fail, I can confidently get a randy savage K/D on it. But do I have fun doing this? No. I’ll give it a 4 because in some game types it redeems it self; and reminds me of the fourth layer from Inception, and that is a good film... 4/10

* **Cracked** - Standard CoD grid affair, as seen in every CoD since the good old pre sprinting CoDs. 5/10

* **Crisis** - a grower, and you’ll start to warm to this map, not a bad map by any means. The amount of secret jump short cuts, makes it a good objective map also. 7/10 

* **Firing Range** - Imo a brilliant map, it’s the only map I camp in, much hate mail!  The actual design I feel is pretty solid, it manages to be a tiny map, yet have complex layers and routes, due to a clever use of a cliff and an invisible wall by the ‘ravine’. Splitting the map in two. Ever seen it not voted for? Exactly 9/10

* **Grid** – not a fan really, far too much fighting for this one building. Not a fan. 4/10

* **Hanoi** - uruggghghg nauseatingly bad map, ensure you won’t enjoy it. I actually spend time just looking at the gallows in one of its two centres hoping to end it all. 2/10

* **Havana** - excellent all round map, harking back to Crossfire. How can you not like it? Only misses out on being a 10, due lack of innovation 8/10

* **Jungle** – innovative scenario and layout, and an excellent example of Treyarch’s poor graphics textures 9/10

* **Launch** - great all round map very similar to Ambush in CoD4 in that the centre ground is higher than the two spawn sides

* **Nuketown** – underachieving son of Shipment

* **Radiation** - a great map, that you can open and close making objectives harder to take? with opposing switches, why hasn’t this been done before? Genius stuff. It’d be good to average otherwise, but I’ll give this a solid 9/10

* **Summit** – Brilliant map, with interesting fire fights in the centre, with just the right amount of cover causing a two levelled battle ground. Not too shabby 7/10

* **Villa** – Not the best map I’ve ever seen…. I believe it rewards a camping mentality, with not enough routes to the camping areas. For example the window above ‘bar’ with only one staircase up to it. Or the massive balcony with only two door ways. C- must try harder 5/10 

* **WMD** – people seem to love this map, if that makes any sense, I get frustrated on it and lose my team too easily and end up being multi-fucked. I’m sure many others like it, however, based on  my friends and this subreddit, so I’ll faithfully give it a 6/10

------------------------------------------------------

**Results:**

MW2 16 maps

BlOps 14 maps

**Conclusion:** I need either a girlfriend
Haha no..

In conclusion, which can lead to interesting maps like Jungle or travesties like Hanoi.

It’s the gameplay of either game that make the difference if you played with the damage and gun recoil of MW2 on BlOps maps you’d have an entirely different experience. Be that to your personal preference or not.

I'm assuming the game will try to put me in a lobby with other who have the exact same DLC installed as I do. But let's say I'm trying to find a game of demolition, has the same map packs installed - will the matchmaking realize that, and just put me in a lobby with a group of players while disabling maps that aren't universally shared from coming up in the map voting? (For example, I have DLC 1 and 2, every other player has DLC 1 and 3...we get put in a lobby together, and all the original maps plus maps from DLC 1 get included in the voting, while DLC 2 and DLC 3 are discarded since they aren't shared).
