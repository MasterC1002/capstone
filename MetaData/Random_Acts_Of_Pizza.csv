For this contest, this is how it’s going to work.  I’m going to be giving away pizzas.  Yes, that’s right, *pizzas*; as in multiple, more than one, numerous, several.  To acquire said pizza
 

**1.** Alert the world that you would like a pizza via comments.

**2.** After I’ve contacted you or something like that

**3.** Wait in anticipation of a delicious piping hot pie.

**4.** Don a ridiculous holiday sweater so the delivery guy can have a good laugh.


 
At the moment, a frequently masturbating goat herder, or just a lonely person needing some cheesy closure; whatever, I don’t care.  I’ll give you a goddamn pizza.  I am by no means wealthy, so this will go on as long as I don’t start fretting about my financial wellbeing, or my funds are depleted-whichever happens first.  I’ll give until my wife threatens to leave me, whatever; I’m giving away pizzas.  If this breaks my bank, because guess what?


I’m fresh out of fucks.


**Disclaimer:** I’m just going to ignore requests from accounts with a lifespan of under 24 hours because I don’t want people trying to get me to give to them twice.


**TL;DR** Read it if you want your pizza

**Edit1** This is proving to be more difficult than I anticipated.  I have close to twenty some tabs opened just trying to sort out who's who in the zoo. Since I’m being swamped with requests


**Edit2** Holy fucking cunt-licking shit

**Edit3**  My hot secretary has graciously offered to donate **2 $20** gift cards to this giveaway (they’ve been only $10 up till now, and can’t guess for both (her words, not mine).  Also, read the fucking rules--waste of time when I have to reply to ""what info do you need?"" 

**Edit4** Sorry folks, my unborn daughter won’t be able to attend college.  If your comment was posted before this I'll still get to you, anyone after that, I'm sorry if I wasn’t able to get to you. Sorry I had to close it so soon, I had not idea it would blow up in just one hour. I was literally receiving 10+ message notifications by the minute.  Hot secretary contest is still going.

**Edit5** Mommabear0816 finally got purple; size is still up.

**Edit6** Fun fact: I now have my credit card number committed to memory. Also

**Edit7** Kudos to RobSpewack for finally guessing 34C. Also, you all owe me pics of you with your pizza and whatever it is you did with it; that is all I ask.

**Edit8** Logged on this morning to find a multitude of messages in my inbox and **reddit gold**. The hell people? It's just pizza. My unborn daughter needs to go to college, hang on, I'm still wading through my inbox. Also, if you haven't received your gift card, let me know so I can call those pretentious bastards and give them what for.",,False,t5_2s7wq,True

I was suspicious, because 999rafica responded twice, and then I had another message saying that he just got my message to PM me.

So - now it won't work and there's another trick that I won't fall for again.  

Of course

EDIT:  For fun

Hi

I got scammed by someone and sent this giftcard to the wrong person.  Take a moment and see if you can appreciate how annoying this is and help me stop the thieving little bastard from getting away with it.  

I'm a part of the Reddit community called Random_acts_of_pizza.  You can find it here

www.reddit.com/r/random_acts_of_pizza

It's a lovely little community that gives away pizzas to people.  Sometimes because they need them and sometimes just for fun.  I myself have purchased about 15 $25 gift certificates from you guys.  In fact

So - this guy made a post and I offered him a pizza:

http://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/comments/leogq/request_havent_eaten_in_36_hours_got_six_bucks_in/

So (if you can go to the link) you'll see that I told him to send me a message with his email and preference of pizza and that I'd send him a gift card.  That's when the scammer stepped in.  He created a new account with a username Very Similar to the person making the post and he sent me a private message with that email address in the hope that I wouldn't notice the difference in the username and that I'd send Him the gift card instead of the needy person.  What an utter ass

Well

I Did send him the gift card.  THIS gift card.  And now I'm hoping that you'll rescind it and foil his evil plan.  Maybe give me a new gift card number as a replacement that I can donate to someone worthy.  If you do this then I'll be sure to mention how you helped foil this nasty little thief.

But here's the thing.  He may have already spent it (in which case I'm screwed).  But if he hasn't then he's likely to spend it very soon.  So - if he hasn't spent it yet

Thank you!

Just to keep this subreddit going strong :)

No, faceboko, photo or whatever. If you want to eat a pizza but can't afford to buy it, or heck, you could just use the equivalent money of a pizza on bills or whatever, post here!

Unfortunately living in Australia I can't buy giftcards for anyone in the US. I've tried and tried and tried with different methods but the giftcard websites outright refuse to let an aussiebuy a Pizza for Americans.

If you live in the UK or Australia though I should be able to manage to giftcard you (but again

I might ask for some proof if your account is like 2 hours old or something (probably verification code)

Another idea: If your'e having trouble transferring the money i sent you from yoru paypal to your bank account try and find someone (who is a registered giver preferably) to buy you the giftcard and accept payment via paypal!

I've turned down offers of food from friends or family members because I thought a good samaritan was doing something nice for a stranger.

So anyway, I usually sit at the bottom of the stairs when I see the Papa John's guy on the camera with my paper and a pen because sometimes [ie. most of the time] they'll leave without signing/giving the sticker because then they get to save them and use them basically like cash around the motels.

Until last night. Last night, she was adorable with an ADORABLE daughter, who decided to tell me about why she was at the motel. She had 80 dollars to her name and was trying to escape her abusive husband, and didn't have enough money to feed her child. A room at the motel is normally 59.95+ tax [67.75 all together] and I gave her the room for 35.95 all together.

I mentioned this in my last post, but you know what? This lady needed a free fucking pizza. And some drinks. And breadsticks. And I do not think I've ever felt better in my life for doing something for another person.

Yes, there are food assistance programs out there, and you should be going there, not Reddit.) It was supposed to give people a chance to enjoy some comfort food that they generally couldn't afford, to make someone smile when they were down and the world was kicking them in the nuts.

And now I get to see posts like ""Hey

Here's my suggestion: stop worrying about whether someone deserves a pizza. That's not to say you shouldn't take common sense steps to ensure someone isn't scamming mounds of free food from multiple suckers, and I think that should be enough to expect good people, the kind of people who frequent RAOP, to respond.

The one day out of the year florists and chocolatiers make over 40% of their annual gross income in a single 24-hour period. Unfortunately for the single population out there, I know – I’ve been there. Being single on Valentine’s Day is akin to spending Christmas or New Year’s alone; not fun. But don’t worry, my lonely friends. RAoP is here to help you. This Valentine’s Day won’t suck, at least, not *as* much.

To put it simply, we had to stretch it out over the entire day. Ah, “we?” you might ask? Yes. WE–**WE.** As you read on, you’ll see just how many people came together in a selfless effort to make your Valentine’s Day less shitty. Before you continue on to the part where you read the guidelines (which, so help me, you *will* read) on how to acquire your pizza, please take the time to recognize this all-star squad of RAoPers who are taking the time to serve you.

The roster

[PastafarianTwit](http://www.reddit.com/user/PastafarianTwit), [Glinda_Da_Good_Witch](http://www.reddit.com/user/Glinda_Da_Good_Witch), [jetboyterp](http://www.reddit.com/user/jetboyterp), [badbrownie](http://www.reddit.com/user/badbrownie), [chupanibre25](http://www.reddit.com/user/chupanibre25), [toncinap](http://www.reddit.com/user/toncinap), [overripebanana](http://www.reddit.com/user/overripebanana), [moshimoochi](http://www.reddit.com/user/moshimoochi), [Cayuscokid](http://www.reddit.com/user/Cayuscokid), [MonkeyHouse](http://www.reddit.com/user/MonkeyHouse)

(Givers

**Guidelines**

So, we would like for you to **post a pic of yourself with a sign reading “RAOP, will you be my Valentine?”** Also be sure to include your name, date, weight, height, professor’s name, ladies can do an undressed version, nor are we poking fun at your single status. We just want to see the smiling faces of all the peeps getting pizza.

One of the fine people mentioned above will contact your (either via comment reply or PM) and request your info so they can give you that pizza we’ve been talking about. If one or more givers responds to you, scissors match via messages (best of three), or a duel on the following morning (one pistol, one bullet, ten paces). To avoid the previously mentioned conflicts. **Givers: if you have already gifted a pizza, please be sure to highlight this in the comments section under said requestor (i.e., pizzad, suck it hunger

**Protip:** If you can decide on the pizza chain you want, your giver can get you your pizza faster. After all this is sorted out, you’ll receive your $10 gift card. Like Pasta, I also work and go to school, so I’m actually forgoing sleep at the moment just to try and give a few out before I go to work. Also, we’re employing the 24-hour account rule for this giveaway to further deter scammers.

 **Couples**

We haven’t forgotten about you; don’t worry, you will also need to post a pic holding the aforementioned sign, *however*, since I don’t want the single people trying to get $20 cards by taking pictures with their mom, sister, cousin, uncle, **your  picture must include you and your significant other showing each other *physical* (operative word here) affection**. Kissing, whatever—just show us that you’re into each other. Same process, rinse

As one who is familiar with mass giveaways, I might add) to conduct one on my own. Needless to say, I was overwhelmed in a matter minutes, receiving no less than a dozen messages every other minute. But now, I have an army of dedicated RAoPers at my back. More people will get pizza, more bellies will be filled. And if I told you the combined monetary pool we’ve put together for this event, you’d shit your pants, change pants, and mere overwhelming numbers won’t stop us.  You will break upon this post as water on rock. 

As King Théoden

Also, bitches.

**TL;DR:** Start at the top.

**Special thanks**

I would first like to take the time to thank all you givers (27!) who took time out of your day and money out of your pockets to help with this cause. Each and every one of you are more generous than most of the people I’ve come across in real life.

My deepest thanks and gratitude to [RobSpewack](http://www.reddit.com/user/RobSpewack) for coming up with the whole Valentine’s Day giveaway idea. If anyone who gets a pizza today feels compelled to pay it forward in the future, Rob, I can’t thank you enough.

I would also like to thank [DownSouthDread](http://www.reddit.com/user/DownSouthDread) who helped me with the promotional aspects, and host of other factors I probably would’ve overlooked had he not brought them to my attention. He really helped nail down the whole “how” aspect to this endeavor and I really don’t know how I would’ve figured this thing out without him.

[Glinda_Da_Good_Witch](http://www.reddit.com/user/Glinda_Da_Good_Witch). Glinda, and she replied that she had a few contacts she would try getting on board. Not even thirty minutes later, she messaged me with a list of givers to add to the list. Then more the following day. This woman can round up people like sheep. However she does it, I can only imagine that there’s a fair amount of magic involved.

Last but not least, [snang](http://www.reddit.com/user/snang), [Cayuscokid](http://www.reddit.com/user/Cayuscokid), [Rollout]( http://www.reddit.com/user/Rollout), [moshimoochi](http://www.reddit.com/user/moshimoochi), and [PastafarianTwit](http://www.reddit.com/user/PastafarianTwit), who were gracious enough to lend their hands to this cause. Pasta also deserves our thanks for his efforts in promoting this event and coordinating with mods from other subreddits to get the word out.

**TL;DR2:** No

Edit: Props to snang for putting up the sweet layout.

The trick is, or Noid himself, or not a tomato or pizza. I'm not sure if there was a bonus for hitting pizzas so many times in a row. You have a 'Bomb' meter in the upper right, fill and use it as much as possible. The games are short, the maximum amount of times you can use the Bomb meter is about 3. Hit all the tomatoes too, if you don't, you lose points. Practice makes perfect! Also, sometimes it had a game running behind the waiting screen

At the times that I've been struggling financially (and it's pretty frequent at the end of a pay period), day-old bread, and anything else cheap that can last. And that's cool, and I'd be grateful, but I'd still be kinda bummed about going through a rough spot.

But pizza is normal. Pizza is happy. Pizza is a tiny, but you don't *feel* poor. You have **pizza**.

And then, and you remember how happy that pizza made you, so you want to make someone else feel like that, so you pay it forward. And then someone else gets to feel a little better about life.

So why pizza? Because it's more than just feeding someone who's hungry. You get to give them a little slice of normal and happy along with filling their tummy with warm

Your incredible acts of generosity have kept us growing at an incredible pace. In the short time I've been here, and countless person to person referrals of the ""magic"" that goes on here. All this attention has brought it's share of more incredible givers, new requesters, and just like anything else, dishonest people that are looking for ways to game and scam the system. 



**The only real way to combat these lowlifes is with an increased awareness in verifying who you are giving to.**

List of things to look for and best practices:

* **Account Name** - Verify that the person you are intending to give to is the person you are corresponding with. **The easiest way to do this is to PM them first!!!** I personally will not reply to any request related PMs unless I first initiated it. Use the [messages view in your inbox](http://i.imgur.com/mFOTk7Z.png) to help with this. It puts a conversation in a thread, it is used almost immediately. **The moderators and admins can't help once the order has been placed, and usually the companies that the GC are ordered through won't offer refunds or reversals onces the GC has been redeemed. If you feel you have been scammed, contact the GC company immediately!**

* **Account History** - Specifically AGE. **Scammers accounts are typically less than a day old
a one month old account age minimum for posts and encourage gifters to use one when choosing a recipient as well. It takes less than 10 seconds to click on someone's account name and [verify their age in the top right of their profile screen](http://i.imgur.com/UONGNa7.png). If you use something like[ RES \(Reddit Enhancement Suite\)](http://redditenhancementsuite.com/)

* **Contests/Offers** - When you choose a recipient for your contest/offer

* **When Responding on a thread** - Use the receiver's account name somewhere in your public response to the thread. If it's someone's request

* **When you've completed a transaction** - Message the mods. Please include a link to the thread. We can then assign you and the receiver the appropriate flair. It also helps us establish a record when investigating deleted posts. 
 
* **When in doubt** - Message the mods **BEFORE making a transaction** if you have any questions. We are here to help make the RAoP experience a good one. [Message us from the sidebar](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FRandom_Acts_Of_Pizza) or stop in to the [IRC Channel](http://www.randomactsofpizza.com/chat). There is usually someone around that can help. We do volunteer our time between work, once the transaction has been completed, we can't really do anything about it. 

[**Random Acts of Pizza**](http://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_of_Pizza/) is an amazing community made up of Redditors from all over the globe and all walks of life

The biggest scam we have is when we have a transaction and someone uses a similar username to PM the gifter and try to intercept the pizza giftcard transaction.

Example:  

[REQUEST] by derpkins

Nice redditor offering to fulfill request gets a PM from a user with the name of ""derpkns.""  See how those usernames don't match up?

Scammers transpose letters or use another method to make their username closely reflect the original requester's username.  

The best way to combat this is to PM the user yourself after you post in the comments that you want to help.

A few meters down the road I saw his car and realise he'd delivered to our house many times (it's the best pizza place in town). Tipping in my country just doesn't happen. It's not protocol, as I walk past his car, I glance around to make sure he's not around and slip a $10 in the windshield wiper (all the cash I had). Then, like a creature of the night, I slink back into the shadows. 

I walk up the street a little, not some passer by. 

After a while I see him emerge from the house he was in. Slouching along slowly, at least when he's in the car it would be obvious, but from his angle of approach, and the fact that the car is directly under a street light, I can tell that he will spot it as soon as he's within 4 or 5 feet of the car. 

As he gets closer I tense up. What if he spots me? What will his reaction to finding free money be? Will I make someones day just that little bit more bearable?  All of these things flash though my mind and suddenly I feel that this gesture has become all about me and making myself feel good! I'm conflicted. My conscience pulled this way and that. Did I do this for the pizza guy

The last things I remember are a thundering of deep horns and flashing lights. Have I been spotted, obviously shocked at the commotion, quickly get in his car and drive away swiftly. As he goes past I can make out through the glare of high-beams the flimsy blue ten dollar note pressed against the glass. 

I hope he sees it before it blows away. ",,t5_2s7wq,1345939951.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/comments/y961t/inverse_acts_of_pizza/

(Details inside),PastafarianTwit,87,6,122,"So today we're announcing the great [RAoP](/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza) Valentine's giveaway.  On Valentine's Day, but we've definitely got over $1000 lined up for sure.  This is going to be MASSIVE

**The Details:**

If you are interested in throwing some money into the pot for donations, I might be slow to respond, but I WILL respond. Should you wish to sign up for a pizza, we plan on putting up the post for entry on Valentine's morning.  This post is NOT the post to reply to if you want a pizza, this is just to give people ample notification because it's going to be HUGE and we want as many people involved as possible, givers and receivers alike.  Also, I'm hoping that a few more redditors get inspired by what we're doing and decide to pitch in. =)

Unfortunately, but when you're sending out this many gift cards, you want to make it as easy as possible.)  International people are always welcome on RAoP, however.  These gift cards will be in amounts of $10 for singles and $20 for couples. (If you're a couple requesting $20, we ask that you post a picture of both of you holding a sign with the date and time [Hell, maybe this is a good way to find a Valentine, eh?])

**Testimonials**

""Due to a garbled interstellar space transmission we have a surplus of pizza gift cards. They're absolutely no use to use in the space future! So

""Valentine's Day is one of those days where life is either great or crappy.  It's either a reminder of what love you do have, I realized that Valentine's Day was the perfect time to get all of the donators together for a huge event the likes of which RAoP hadn't seen.""  -RobSpewack

The **apology** comes because, and still haven't been able to return the favor; I'll be moving soon because I can't afford rent, and bringing my job hunt to a city with better prospects (I love my town, but if I'm going to be effectively homeless and unemployed, I figure it's smarter to do it somewhere with a better chance of changing that; besides, there is no chance for advancement in my field (culinary) in a town this size, whereas in the city I'll be able to work in a 'real' kitchen). What this ads up to is that not only have I not given pizza yet, and that's the apology.

The **promise** part is that I do stand by my word, I owe this community 4 pizzas - one for each of the people who helped me (or gifted in their name, if they prefer, I'll figure that out when I get there ;) and one just cause I really want to give pizza (If delivery places took foodstamps man... ;). 

Anyhow, or non-need based competitions, because hey, pizza is awesome...), and it looks like I won't be able to Offer for a while, but I wanted to make a post to all of you saying: Stay Awesome (you're pretty good at it).

Lately, post a request 5 minutes later and then they explore and learn more about reddit..good for them.  Maybe they will only join for pizza, again..good for them.  

This story no doubt will bring a growing crowd to our group.  I'd like to ask you all to embrace and make these new members feel welcome.  At the very least

The story they will see is about an amazing group of people reaching out and giving to others.  We don't want to give off the impression that we don't like/appreciate/accept newbies.  We want everyone to feel welcome to post here as often as their heart desires.  Thats the cool thing

I understand and respect the *reasoning* for the doubts, don't allow this to allow you to take it out on or assume this about all members.

I am posting this after speaking with Gadianton about the happenings of late.  This community is a wonderfully awesome place.  I'd hate to see it become a place where everyone and everything is questioned or second guessed.

Sure

We are lucky in the fact that not only our members are awesome, allow them to look into it/discuss amongst themselves and do as they see fit on a one by one basis.  

If you are a giver who wants to see proof, doesn't make them someone not on the up and up.  Be reasonable, remember there is another human with feelings on the other side of the screen.  Think of how you'd feel if someone said/did something the way you are about to, would you like it? If not, chances are the newbie won't either.

1315878572.0,kdqot,Thoughts for requesters,jesses_girl,83,10,44,"I'd like to state first up that these are just some thoughts. Not even solid hypotheses, although I'd appreciate other people's thoughts too.

RAoP is awesome. I'm sure you knew that already. Requesters have the chance to be gifted with tasty pizza

Sometimes I see a lot of unanswered requests and it makes me wonder why some requests get offers but not others. 

Here are my thoughts: 

* The people who give pizza, or who have an extra bit of money this week, or have a bit of discretionary income. They’re people who are not buying that new pair of shoes/new game/cup of coffee/magazine/expensive food because it’s more fun and rewarding to give pizza. Givers can’t afford to give to everyone, so every giver has their own criteria (and WHATEVER that criteria is, it’s a perfectly fine criteria).

* Posts with only one line requesting a pizza may be more likely to be overlooked because perhaps it’s easy to draw a line between how much effort someone puts into requesting a pizza to how much they want it.

* Similarly

* People are empathetic – they like to hear stories and feel connected and involved. Perhaps telling a bit about yourself and your situation may help people connect with you. If your account is a new account, or your family, or the things that you like to do/watch/play. Maybe your burning passion for alpacas is shared by another alpaca enthusiast who happens to have some extra money from an alpaca sale. Make the reader feel as though you’re not just a screen-name looking for a quick feed, but a real, live, feeling person whose day would be brightened by a pizza or two.

* Speaking as someone who’s given a couple of pizzas away, *please* and *thank you* are wonderful words – free to use and they make the world a nicer place. Please, use them liberally.

**TL;DR** – nothing

There has been some suggestion lately to bring back the down arrow. I removed it originally due to seeing every post downvoted, but if enough of the community disagrees with me the arrow will reappear.

Shortly along comes his girlfriend, and when he had declined, the ""friend"" had slashed his tire with a knife - in fact, quite a large one. This friend was also sat across the street, well within viewing distance.

Naturally, and start whipping out the gear. We get the tire off just as another of this dude's ""friends"" comes over, and starts to be generally unhelpful and stand around in the way... whatever, I can still deal. His girlfriend also comes over, and they begin chatting about general shit. One topic that keeps coming up is how the gentleman I am in the midst of assisting is ""still on tag"" - which means they have been convicted of some kind of crime in the UK. Normally a tag also involves a curfew, and they are often handed out for violent crime. Nice. Turns out his mate is also ""on tag"". Nothing quite like roadside repair while surrounded by individuals with a penchant for violence should things not go their way.

By this point, as he snaps my tyre lever in half. Lovely. Just to top it all off, the guy's tire is still flat. Turns out two 1cm holes opposite each other on the tube just won't patch properly. Who'da thunk it? So anyway, ""thanks anyway""s are exchanged, and I begin the ride home - only to find that while leaving the site of my ad-hoc repairwork, I have a nice chunk of glass lodged in my own tire, and my tube is deflating with a deeply unwelcome hiss.

But now that I've got your attention, namely, CAYUCOSKID, to South America this summer where he is volunteering for Habitat for Humanity.
And

So, please, please, if you have a few extra dollars this week, please, please, donate to CayucosKid so he can volunteer and help out some needy families and make this world a better place.

And for all those who do NOT have credit cards, PM me and I will give you my Paypal addy or home address.

Let's all back this worthwhile cause and come together as a group.


Oh

And for our dear

Lately there's been a lot of scamming going on.  We at Random_Acts_Of_Pizza are not responsible with how you spend your money (because it's random!)


Here's a list of things you can do to avoid this:

1. **Look at the username's post history.**  We cannot stress this enough.  Click on the username you're curious about and it will bring up their history.  Feel free to read into it.  If they don't seem like a person you like- don't give to em.  Just because you said

2.  **Message the moderators.**  If you have a question about anything at all; hit up the mod mail or message anyone of us.  We'll be more than happy to assist you in the giving process.

3.  **Flair.**  The flair we give out on each username is in direct correlation with how many pizzas they receive or give.  If someone is requesting a pizza- and they have customized flair

4.  **Sob stories.**  This is not **Charitable**_acts_of_pizza.  But that does not mean we don't appreciate giving to those in need.  If you really want to be sure that you don't get swayed in the wrong direction- don't let people influence you with sob stories.  Give out the pizza randomly- then you know it was random.  TL;DR: [**No sob story

5.  **Username games.**  My name is moshimoochi.  Some people might make an account ""rnoshimoochi"" but if you capitalize letters- RNOSHIMOOCHI.  This is the internet people.  Take everything with a grain of salt.  If someone posts a request- click on **THEIR** username and message them.  Demand they reply to the PM you sent them.  Then you have a paper trail and know the username is the one you have been corresponding with.

Feel free to post more tips and hints in this thread and I'll add them to the top accordingly.",,t5_2s7wq,False,,Moshi,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/comments/pst64/announcement_lately_theres_been_a_lot_of_scamming/

1) RAOP has: some people who give regularly; some people who give occasionally; some people who have given once or twice

2) RAOP has: some people who are in need and are asking for help

3) RAOP has: some trolls who are bored and like to cause problems

The publicity we got here most definitely caused an increase in #3

The removal of the downvote was a classically liberal attempt to soften the pride-injury of having to ask for help. (I say ""liberal"" in the academic sociological sense, instead of the ""folks"" doing the self-moderation through voting, the moderators have had their job responsibilities increased.

Each pizza-giver has a set of criteria by which he/she decides to give or not give, that's what makes a wonderfully diverse world. I have certain categories of askers that automatically get me to pay more attention, and other categories which cause me to skip reading their posts entirely. I do not publicize my categories because it invites trolls and scammers. I do not require that everybody else agree with my categories/criteria. My set of criteria are right FOR ME. 

You have the right to question my criteria. I have the right to ignore you. 

You have the right to choose different criteria. That's fine. That's why Baskin Robbins makes 31 flavors

We will be getting some more media attention soon and we'd like to emphasize the community nature of RAOP and the ethos of giving and ""Pizza It Forward"" that we've all developed.  Any ideas on how to best educate new members is especially appreciated.  Please feel free to include text suggestions that we can add to the site.

I made my transaction and left. 
When leaving the parking lot I couldn't help but notice a van with a bunch of dogs inside. The sticker on the door identified it as belonging to the One At A Time Pet Rescue. The gas pump it was beside read $50.00. I put two and two together and turned around. The lady was still at the ATM and was talking to her husband on the phone trying to figure out what to do. So I bought the gas and a coffee for her. Or rather for the animals. She had 24 dogs in the van. I work in a disaster related field in a devastated area and it was apparent that she had picked up dogs from an overrun shelter and was taking them elsewhere to be adopted out.

1307490221.0,hu634,My pizza story.,crayzieman,62,3,3,"This is not a tale of overcoming hardship and adversity or of unemployment and sorrow. No

A week and a half ago on Friday I got paid (yes I have a job, I'm not a heavy drinker, so a bunch of beer to me is a case worth that would probably last me a month or more usually.

I still haven't paid my rent at this point, and now I really need to start worrying.

I get my [plates](http://i.imgur.com/MC5UK.jpg) and my license renewed and it ends up costing more than I expected. Not only that but I still need to put gas in my car and pay for the internets. I did what I could to make what little food I had stretch but by the weekend I was pretty much down to nothing but potatoes and beer. For the last 3 days or so that's [all I've been eating.](http://i.imgur.com/d7P8u.jpg)

Then I came across this subreddit in a post that made it to the front page. As I read the posts I realized people had much worse tales than me. I started to feel bad about even thinking of posting a request at all. Then I stumbled across a post made by someone coat tailing an offer thread. His post almost [seemed to be speaking to me directly](http://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/comments/hth7t/offerpizza_pizza/c1y8r9s) so I took a chance and pmed him the tl;dr of what was going on with me. He must have found it to be a worthy cause because he went ahead and sent me one of the gift cards.

So big thanks go out to [flamingcow](http://www.reddit.com/user/flamingcow) and reddit for saving my liver from further unnecessary stress. My stomach also thanks them because eating potatoes for 3 straight days really does a number on your inner workings. I will definitely be paying it forward very soon. Many upboats will be sailing your way soon Mr. Cow. You definitely went above and beyond.

1324973304.0,ns3dj,The definitive guide to ordering internationally,in2itiveact,64,5,32,"There are frequent questions on how to overcome the challenges of ordering a pizza from one country for delivery in another. As an Aussie who has had success arranging deliveries for many other countries I have put together the following guide.

Happy for anyone to ask questions for clarification or for anyone else that had had success to add to the info I have put together :)

Perhaps the mods can link to this in the sidebar if appropriate?


**International Random Acts of Pizza**


*The Aim*

To order pizza from one country for delivery in another.


*The Problem*

The only way to achieve this is to pay via credit card. Online credit card transactions often verify your identity by matching your card number with your name and address. If you don't have an address in the country you are ordering for

Some of you are probably thinking about the vendors that offer PayPal as a payment method. Unfortunately you can't pay for something that is being delivered to a country other than your own when paying with PayPal


*Things to consider*

The key to beating the system is figuring out exactly what the online pizza vendor in question uses to verify that you are the cardholder. Two things are universal - the cardholder name and the security code on the back of the card. Other than these two

Street address
City/Suburb/Town etc
Zip or postal code

The first two are easy to work with. The last can be problematic as different countries format their zip/postal codes in different ways. Some have four digits, some use letters - crazy!

Other vendors use credit card company specific verification - such as ""Verified by VISA"" - to verify ownership. Put simply

Even if you can get past all these issues there are a few more important things to consider. All vendors

Another and perhaps more important issues is that these days your card issuer will actively try to prevent fraudulent use of your card. You can bet your bottom dollar that if they see one or two pizza transactions in countries other than your own on your card they will suspend it until they speak with you. It may be wise to notify them before you start ordering. My card issuer has been put on notice... Ignore international transactions at pizza stores! :)

Another issue you might face is the language barrier! More on this below.


**Beating the system**

I'm in Australia and have managed to successfully order pizzas for redditors in the USA, Germany and Denmark. Here are some of the challenges I faced and the methods I used to get around them.


*Ordering for the USA*

The two easiest vendors are Dominos and Papa Johns. Though both say they require the cardholder to be present for the delivery, or subtract some digits from the front or back of your cod to make five. This has worked for my 4 digit Australian zip code multiple times.

Papa Johns require a zip code and an address. I use my actual street address but use the town and state for the actual recipient. Again

Pizza Hut works using the above methods as well

Cashstar.com


*Ordering for Canada*

Problem! The online vendors in Canada all accept credit card


*Ordering for the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland*

Dominos in the UK are easy


*Ordering for Germany/Denmark and other non-English speaking countries*

Luckily as far as the credit card transaction thing goes I've never had to enter anything other than the security code on the back of my card when transacting here. The problem has been with the language barrier.

I've managed to successfully deliver pizza thanks to the assistance of Google translate and the recipient guiding me through the order process using screenshots and in some cases even setting up an order and saving it


*Ordering for Australia*

Being from Australia I can't speak to the challenges of ordering for here from elsewhere. I would love for someone from across the seas to look after an Aussie using the methods from above so we can verify that it works!

Having ordered pizza locally myself via the Dominos online system I'm almost certain that there is no verification against an address or zip/postal code at all. This


**Other things to consider**

Unlike gift certificates, however, ask for the phone number of my recipient. This allows me to add it to the order in the event the driver needs to call them if they can't find the place.

If your recipient does give you their name

In some cases you might attempt to arrange a carry out order for your recipient. This can be complicated as it is more likely than not that the vendor will require the credit card that paid for the order for verification. I have

In some countries tipping is customary. Papa Johns in the USA allow you to specify your tip when completing the order. Dominos on the other hand require the recipient to add it at the door (in this case I tell my recipient to add a reasonable amount when receiving the pizza). Please don't disregard this aspect when ordering a RAoP.

1330190152.0,q5lc2,"[OFFER] Hey Reddit, Ready for a TRUELY random giveaway? 2 pizza pies here!",shaynagier,60,10,http://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/comments/q5lc2/offer_hey_reddit_ready_for_a_truely_random/, and now it's pizza-giving time! For my last contest thingy I had you all write superb sentences staring s-worded sentences... and today is just random! You comment

How is this ""truly random?"" You ask.  Good question! 

This is how it's going to work- You comment, all of your entries are disqualified. I will count ""Re:"" comments, but I won't count replies of yourself to your own comment if that makes sense:

     Ex: Person 1: I'd love a pizza please!
     person 2: You just got a pizza yesterday! 
     person 1: but my dog ate it- here's a pic!
     person 3: That sucks! Hope you win
     person 2: Haha! That's amazing. Sure hope you win!
     person 1:Thanks... best of luck to you too!
  
     for the example Person 1, then they would earn a second entree- got it?

So This all starts now and will end at exactly  4:56 central time. At which point I will write your names down in the order that they posted, and written down on a new list, and I will go to the next group of 6.... and I'll repeat this until 1 group of 6 remains. The person that wins that die-roll- gets the pizza!

The OTHER pizza is for one of the poor souls who got kicked out in the first round- hence the writing down on another list who that was. Again, than I'll roll again and that person will win.

So.. You have about 5 hours give-or-take. Let's chat! Random topic of discussion to start- What is something you should probably get rid of but haven't yet? Why haven't you? 

See ya around/at 4:56!


Edit: ok, and group by intravals of 5-minutes the best I can. It'll take me a while to do the work, but I'm so freaking excited about this giveaway and I gonnna do it the right! 

Edit: ATTENTION REDDIT: Hangovers are avoidable- and not just by not-drinking! When you drink be sure to include a NON-ALCOHOLIC drink and FOOD. The more alcohol- the more food/water. If you do this- then you should not get any hangover at all! It works for me :-)

Edit: Also


Closed! Feel free to keep chatting- I've got a few dice to roll one at a time! Be back... later :-)


It's 7:53 here and I'm starting to roll the die... winners soon! 


Wow! That took a while! First there was the writing down the entrants - [Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/85UJs.jpg)  and can I just say the people who collaboratively ""acted"" out my sample scenario are AWESOME!

Then I Had to roll the die- introducing your Pizza-giving-dice of 2012: [Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/lRqN5.jpg)

Which started the elimination that ended like this-  [Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/ChCX2.jpg)

So, we do have all the fixings for a decent Thanksgiving dinner (turkey, pumpkin pie, stuffing, green bean casserole, mashed potatoes, etc).

There are only three of us (me, but we have enough food to feed us and probably another 3 people. So, I thought, why not have someone over for Thanksgiving dinner?

Here's how this would work:

-It's going to be held at our apartment in Vancouver

-This offer is for up to a maximum of 3 people (so we're talking a single person, possibly 2 if they're littler.....or some combination). We'd take more if we could but then I'd be afraid we wouldn't be able to feed all of you properly, lol.

-You have to be able to find your own way here. If you're super close and have no transportation I could probably come get you

-I would prefer this offer goes to someone who really needs it

-Finally

If I get multiple requestors...I'll have a decision by Monday of next week so we have ample time to get things squared away

As a flat we agreed to pay 1/4 the bills ea, 125 ea, i payed the 100 dollar net bill (that is in my name) and the guy that pays the power owed me 20 dollars so that's 120 payed out of my 125 due.
i had talked to the guy paying the power before hand, which technically is correct, anyway i have 1 week to get a house with no money...

Until last month there was only 3 of us living in my house , going halves in it then no problems here they payed the power which was 300 a month and i payed the net bill which was 200 a month, so i was doing them a favor by not making them pay for any of the extra.
last month i managed to haggle the net company down to 100 dollars a month as i was offered a far better offer by a competing ISP

so now we are back to the start, out of 220, i borrowed 20 to a friend for food which he said he could pay back the next day, but he said he didn't get paid, so i got 40 dollars food this week, and have eaten it all already, down to 1 cup
ALSO flatmates broke all the elements doing illicit activities which involve knifes... so i cannot cook anything either

Like many others, but shit happens. We're given ample opportunity to thrive here, and we even have safety nets that others just aren't ever afforded, but we are given more than plenty of chances to sink or swim. 

And now, scared I'll drown in a pool of my own debt and scared I'll become a number that we consider the ""greedy lazy looking for handouts.""

My fears are comforted though. Comforted by those who have been where I am and now have success stories. I also find comfort in knowing my fate if I give in to feeling sorry for myself and my situation. The comfort I found most recently was those so readily willing

I requested a pizza once last year and I cant tell you how grateful I was for it. I was working for the fire department and I was broke and homeless

But these days, I live in Georgia and I'm looking for work and I lost my roommate so I lost the apartment. That truck I've been sleeping in is going to get repossessed next week if I don't come up with something fast. I've applied for every job under the sun and I'm just waiting to hear back from them now. 

I feel like a schmuck asking again... but if anyone could help me out. I will no doubt, but never got around to it. Life got hectic... 

But I have sunk every bit of cash I had into gasoline for my truck

So

I know things are going to get better for me... cause my god they can't get any worse!!

It doesn't matter whether you believe tips should exist or not

Many of you have cited federal and state minimum wage laws, call the irs, etc. Spend thousands to get minimum wage? No thanks. Do you know how difficult it is for class action lawsuits to be organized?

It seems to be a decent split with the members here. If you people feel it is moral to give charitably in such a way that hurts someone else, it's not just not getting a tip, but you're wasting their time and costing them the opportunity to be delivering to somebody that does tip.

Last Saturday night, I decided to stop at IHOP and drown my sorrows in pancakes and maple syrup. 

The lone waitress there was visibly stressed

Despite her bad luck, even without asshole customers.

Anyways, and she nodded yes.  My bill was only $10.  I pulled out my wallet, and handed her my last $40, and told her to keep the change.  She paused for a few seconds with a look of incredulity, started to tear up a little bit, and then thanked me.  I wanted to brighten her night up a bit, and being able to help someone else improved my mood as well.  

I'm not trying to toot my own horn.  I just wanted to tell this story

So if you work overnights, do you like working nights, post some pics, etc.  I'll pick someone in the next day or 2 and send a $15 gift card to one of the big 3 chains.

The reason I'd like to buy someone a pizza and why I have a preference about who it goes to (not that I mean to judge about who is ""deserving"") is that I'd like to help someone do what my parents do for me.

So, and never the type to ask for things, I just enjoy watching the amazing acts on this subreddit.

I do however participate in little contests held for pizza as the prize when I can.  I LOVE the idea of a little contest, I've begun to notice a large number of very rude comments made when someone submits something.  I assume this is an attempt to make up for the inability to down vote someone here (a feature I appreciate), but still... there is no need for this.

Now, as if giving someone a compliment would lower your chances in winning?  

This isn't cool guys.  If someone submits a picture, DON'T say things like ""OMG, this person shouldn't win"" for whatever reason.... that is up to the giver, not you.  

Personally, but to have someone sit there and down my work because I have more upvotes then them is just juvenile and should be discouraged here.  We need to all play with good sportsmanship here.

I hope I'm not the only one that feels this way.",,t5_2s7wq,False,,shroom,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/comments/m6mi7/dear_raop_lets_talk_about_good_sportsmanship_when/

**UPDATE 2** Hello

Although we never received pizza from *Random Acts of Pizza*

*(The first* ""boy pizza"" *had pepperoni, and red pepper; the second* ""girl pizza"" *was feta cheese, sundried tomato, red onion, and green olives.  There was also 20 deep-fried wings, ordered with BBQ sauce but supplemented with the home's own Frank Sauce. A jug of Nestle Ice Tea Zero was offered and shared all around.)*

I just want to thank everyone who has offered to assist my fianceé and I in the last few days. She's as astounded and overjoyed at this post as I am, ethics, and humility, I've decided to graciously accept a few offers (if still available) via private message. If declined, I fully understand with no ill will.

Once again, and we love you.

I just got home from my university in Copenhagen

Lately I wanted to send a pizza over reddit to someone in need

I rarely see homeless people in Denmark, others sits quietly and embarrassed waiting for people to notice them. I've never given money to homeless who enters trains - it feels forced and back in my head I still have the voice saying ""Who knows what they really use the money for?"" - I think a lot of us have that voice in our head, to make sure we aren't being taken advantage of.

But! Since I started reading this subreddit I thought it might be a good idea to buy some food instead and find someone who I can see needs it. I left the train in Nørreport and sure enough there were a man of age 60(?) sitting on a small chair, sandwich and an apple), got back, sat down and asked him if he was hungry - he nodded yes and I handed him his menu and wished him a great day. 

Never have I seen a person's eyes light up that much. And I've never felt so good

What's up next? Next time I go to my university again, and this time I'll stay and eat with the person. Who wouldn't want company?

I heard about this subreddit on the news a few months ago and it just came to me to post this request on here. I've been a redditor since Februrary, so we're not totally isolated from the outside world.

My wife has been diagnosed with Asperger's Syndrome this year ([Wikipedia linkage](http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asperger_syndrome))

I've been out of steady work for close to two years now. I have my GED but no college education and constantly keep my ear to the ground for new businesses opening or odd jobs that need to be done in my area. I've had some experience with renovating homes

So now it comes to our lease ending this month. We're living in a studio apartment under 250 square feet for about $235/month

And to top it all off

I'm sorry if this post is fragmented or unreadable, I'd be happy just for my bride to get a good meal.

I asked the owner of the place, and deliver them to the homeless on the street. He agreed! We choose a Fisker Karama because it was charged, available, and could hold nearly 50 pizzas. What we could not fit in the car was given away via craigslist in the free ad's.

Medical problems and only one income for three adults and a child has strained our financial situation. On Friday April 19th I looked into my bank account and [realized the worst had come.](http://i.imgur.com/cwgRVrT.jpg) That's negative $26. We had no food in the fridge for adults and I was crushed in despair under my situation.

Then someone on /r/trees posted a delicious picture of [pizza](http://i.imgur.com/4Ec6Qyb.jpg) (My god that is still delicious looking...) which I decided to [comment on.](http://www.reddit.com/r/trees/comments/1cqf0p/pizza/c9j05w3)  Now in hindsight maybe I should have just stayed quiet but the hunger was on me something fierce. From that post, I have a [wife and child](http://i.imgur.com/Di5vxyr.jpg) and a [recently unemployed roommate](http://i.imgur.com/PnX4wnP.jpg) who are all really important to me. But I asked. Which [I capped the original post into a pic.](http://i.imgur.com/BSbVsqx.jpg)

I made the post as I went in to work that night. And in my cubby box work had given me [a pair of free tickets to a certain event.](http://i.imgur.com/UnoVdlT.jpg) We'll get back to that.

So I spent work from midnight till eight in the morning waiting to see how things would turn out. I got a response from [donny_pots](http://www.reddit.com/user/donny_pots) quickly, maybe begged, for just a pizza. Just one pizza maybe, you know? Remind me what it's like to eat a fatty meal, but a filling one at that. Then a response by  [dehOne](http://www.reddit.com/user/dehOne) offering pizza. I should have said no. But it sounded like I might get two pizzas. Shame on me, I guess. Then another person [mm_kay](http://www.reddit.com/user/mm_kay) sent a pizza. 3 whole pizzas!

I did in many of these cases try to let them know that someone else already helped

Me and the wife and our daughter left to go see [muppets](http://i.imgur.com/Oh5zOUa.jpg) and watch a free show work comped me. [It was crazy and my daughter loved it.](http://i.imgur.com/VEfmQB2.jpg) I had barely enough gas to get there and back before the gas light came on

So I return home to find pizzas. Pizzas everywhere. They came while we were at the show, but I'll try and make the correct associations there.  donny_pots and mm_kay both sent me pizzas, I think three total between them. But it was dehOne who made me cry.

dehOne first sent me [this amazing spread of food.](http://i.imgur.com/xzFnycJh.jpg) which was a weekend meal enough as is, I found someone had gifted me a month of Reddit Gold.

So there you go Reddit. I asked for maybe a pizza or two. My pessimism told me no one would really help, an empty fridge, and a lot of stress I asked you guys for help. And you helped. About ten pizzas, $25 in my gas tank, a Sesame Street show (not you guys technically but I still thank you), and enough food to get us to a paycheck where we can eat real food finally.

Thank you. I love you all. Thank you so much. I feel terrible still, thank you [mm_kay](http://www.reddit.com/user/mm_kay), and thank you a big bunch [dehOne](http://www.reddit.com/user/dehOne).

(Everyone really should come hang out there... I'm on that chat channel all day during the work week along with lots of other awesome RAOP folks).

Anyway

1) What do you guys think about adding some sort of Donation link to accept donations that we could then use for giveaways?  The reddit admins have added a couple of solutions that would let us do this.  

Some of the ideas we've had is we could hold weekly/monthly giveaways

2) I have also thought about forming a 501(c)(3) charity that would allow donations to RAOP to be tax deductible at least in the US.  

So let's use this thread to discuss these ideas and any other ones.

Its been awhile since I have done a contest on here. Hadn't really had any good ideas for any until late last night. So with that here are the rules fo the contest and how you win.

1. Make a comment to this post.
2. Have no one else comment after you for ~~2 hours~~. 1 hours
3. Every time someone comments
4. There is an end time I am not announcing to this contest and person closest to that wins if no one hits the ~~2 hour~~ 1 hour time limit.
5. You can post as many times as you see fit. 

This is going to be some what hard to track, as does everyone so please bear with me as I try to verify winners.
Depending how things go

Usual crap I put in here
Account MUST be over 30 days old
U.S. Only. (Sorry people outside the U.S. here is a &lt;3 to compensate!)

Let the contest begin.

Edit: Adding on

Edit2: Since I see some confusion
Also

Edit3: So someone gave me an idea for another contest, want a second upvote? post something else interesting.

Edit4: To those sending me message

Edit5: Since some people keep asking

Edit6: replies to posts do reset your count and since I put it up above

Edit7: As I said in a post below, I have given in the past (over 10 pizzas) and plan to do so in the future, I just like to make interesting contests.

Edit8: Back to work I go, Which could be sometime in the next 1-4 hours. So good luck! I will also give a 15 minute warning up here at the top. =P

Edit9: So I think at 650+ comments its time to end this... 50 minutes from whenever this edit was done, it is now who is closest to the end time that has been set.

All you have to do is post a picture of your long-haired bearded self holding a sign with your reddit username and the date in the format DD/MM/YY(YY) and then I'll get things underway to get you your pizza. The gentlemen with the most epic hair/beard combo wins it (basically if you have extremely long hair and a Pai Mei beard then you definitely win).

**IMPORTANT:** I live in England so if you're American, I'll be using the Domino's site as the default for ordering online which requires you to give me some more personal info but I won't be holding onto it or anything. If you happen to have a different/better pizza place near you with an online pay/delivery thing with deals then I'll look into that too but please only online secure stuff.

A while back a redditor in the UK sent my wife and I a pizza. We could use it at the time

I personally would recommend smaller pizzerias
Most smaller pizzerias will not have a problem in taking your credit card payment


Large chains, Papa Murphy's, etc, require seeing the card holder with the card at the place of delivery. This is one of the issues that we ran into. The easiest way (and in my finding the only way) to avoid this issue is not to mention anything about it. Order the pizza online, or as if you were the one at the delivery site. Most delivery people (although required to) do not ask to see the card. If by chance they do require it you may have an issue.


Some further suggestions:

Feel free to post if you have need

If you receive a pizza please take a moment from your enjoyment to share with the rest of us


Please do not be a frequent need poster

We would rather see this community thrive, but would rather not have to.


Lets spread word of this community on Reddit!!!!


Lets all have fun


As I said this will be edited with more suggestions as they arise.

The prize will be a $25 giftcard to the chain of your choice (Pizza Hut

So

To enter, but you all know the general idea of what I mean. Just something that you're proud of, or think is really awesome.

Then explain a bit about *why* that thing is so cool. I may not personally find it that cool

Want some hints about what I might find cool? Well, and I'm getting into Naruto. I love funny things. But that's not everything, so you'll have to guess (if you want to appeal to my interests).

Now for a few rules:

* Accounts older than a month
* US only
* You must have done stuff other than ask for things on subreddits like RAOP.
* This one's harder for me to enforce, let others have a chance. It's just nice.
* If you want to whine about how you're dying of six different diseases and your 58 children are crying every night for pizza
* VERIFY YOUR PICTURE. For those that don't know what it means, you can take two pictures, one with the username paper blocking part of the object and one with the whole thing. It would be far too easy to steal an awesome picture off of the internet, and that's not fair to everyone else.

I think that's all the info we need for the contest itself...oh, I will pick my favorite entry and give them the prize!

Open for 24 hours cos I've forgotten what time it is in USA-land. 

Mods

**EDIT:** We have winners! The delay was due to discussions with some lovely other RAoPers who wanted to throw in some extra gift cards as prizes :) tanyagal2 has generously offered 2 $15 gift cards and there may be another offerer as well. 

It was *really* hard to pick a winner. Damn but RAoP has some gorgeous men. I wish I had the means to buy you all pizza. I feel bad that I have to leave people out! Also

My first pick was just_another_man, that in addition to being very good looking, he is also a gentleman :)

2. You're going to need a verification code
 
3. Oh, either in the comments or via PM, your desire for pizza--and which type (either Domino's, Papa John's, or Pizza Hut).  Don't bother sending any type of story, I believe in unconditional pizzas!
 
4. Hmm, tell me... something! Know a good joke? What about the coolest thing you've done recently? Are you working on anything cool?  Hell, I don't care, just tell me something! If you want to say ""I'm tired and I play minecraft all day""--that's good enough for me!

- one entry per person.  no editing your post to update your drawing (or as a placeholder).  any posts with the edit mark (or that I happen to catch being ninja edited) are disqualified.  that means don't edit for stupid things like spelling

- BONUS: each entrant can PM me one guess (only one) as to why I rarely eat cake.  if you are correct AND you otherwise won a prize in one of the categories above

- must have had reddit account for at least 2 months with some minimal level of activity (my discretion)

There has been a lot of people helped

There have been some concerns expressed about people scamming to get pizza. We really see that the mass majority of people are truly in need

**If your intention is to give pizza to a person in need**, or ask for a phone number so you can call and talk to them. If someone is in true need, and you offer, they should be fine with going along with this.

This does not mean that you should not just offer a pie to someone who posts a request

**Please help the mods help the new people** There are a lot of new people trying to figure out reddit, or asking a question help please... It is why we are all here right? Help....

If there is a scammer please report them to us. I hope their karma bites them in the ass
