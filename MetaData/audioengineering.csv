**How do I record my microphone/guitar/preamp with my computer?**

If you're here you most likely want to record yourself or others onto some storage medium.  Computers provide a convienent, et al) for recording audio.  For analog audio signals to be converted into digital signals that can stored and manipulated on a computer it must undergo the process of analog-to-digital conversion and for you to be able to listen it again, it must be converted back to the analog domain through a digital-to-analog converter.  Any computer soundcard contains these converters (known as ADCs and DACs), though for recording purposes a profesional device is typically used.  The professional converters we are interested in here are called 'audio interfaces', which is what we call converters that have some method of interfacing with a computer.  They can come in two forms: internal cards (PCI, PCIe) or external interfaces (USB, Firewire

These interfaces vary wildly in their features and cost, if any have hi-z inputs for direct recording of guitar/bass, additional digital inputs, and internal hardware routing and effects.  Some will even operate independently of a computer in a 'standalone mode.'  External interfaces are increasingly common, with them being included in many low-cost mixers as well (though frequently only a 2-channel stereo interface on cheaper models), and performance of reasonable quality can be had rather cheaply.

**What kind of computer do I need for recording?**

This is not a computer-focused sub, minus the need for a fast graphics card.  A quality motherboard, power supply, and fast CPU are pretty much essential.  4GB-8GB of RAM is a good idea, more if you're going to be running large multisampled software instruments like orchestra packs.  Two hard drives, one for your OS/applications and one for recording/sample libraries is also a good idea (required for PT) to avoid underruns due to hard disk paging.  The internal graphics in the newer Intel and AMD CPUs are fine, a graphics card isn't going to make your DAW run better.  In fact, but I don't use them myself so I can't test that theory.

**How do I soundproof my dorm/bedroom/apartment?**

The first thing you should know is that sound proofing is not acoustic treatment.  Soundproofing is a method of reducing sound transmission between the studio and outside the studio.  Acoustic treatment aims to treat the studio so that the acoustics are better for recording.

Unfortunately it is very difficult and expensive to effectively soundproof an existing structure. Another factor to consider is that if you are renting or otherwise do not own the property it may be against the terms of your lease to modify the space in any meaningful way. As well, it is more difficult and costly to soundproof against low frequencies versus high frequencies. The following links describe soundproofing and acoustic treatment in the context of small spaces in more detail.

**What DAW (Digital Audio Workstation

*This is not an exhaustive list of DAWs or their capabilities.*

The answer to this question is highly dependent on your situation. You don't 'need' Pro Tools to do professional-sounding work; in fact many pros use DAWs such as [MOTU Digital Performer](http://www.motu.com/products/software/dp/) or [Steinberg Cubase](http://www.steinberg.net/en/products/cubase/start.html).  Pro Tools has become something of a de-facto standard in commercial studios due to a variety of historical factors (not the least of which is [vendor lock-in] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vendor_lock-in)) and familiarity for outside engineers, [Ableton Live](http://www.ableton.com)(focused on live performance of electronic music), [Apple Logic Pro](http://www.apple.com/logicpro/)(popular in audio post circles).  [Cakewalk Sonar](http://www.cakewalk.com/products/sonar/), [Presonus StudioOne](http://studioone.presonus.com/), [Image-Line FL Studio](http://flstudio.com), [Steinberg Nuendo](http://www.steinberg.net/en/products/nuendo.html), and [Propellerheads Reason](http://www.propellerheads.se/products/reason/) all have their devotees as well.

###Some advice to follow before posting a thread about noise or other problems

*******

**Basic Troubleshooting**


Before posting questions about problems

Many of these may seem illogical, the microphone cable is bad.  If it doesn't fix it, try another mic, different preamp, etc.  

http://www.reddit.com/r/audioengineering/wiki/index#wiki_basic_troubleshooting




**I'm getting noise in my recordings


Before posting about a noise problem, ""clicking"" can all mean different things to different people. Buffer underrun sounds different from cellphone interference, however both could be described as clicking, buzzing, or stuttering.  Also provide a complete description of the signal chain from beginning to end, type/model of computer if there's a computer involved, and pictures of everything (including where cables are going) if possible. What may seem unrelated or insignificant to you may in fact be the source of the problem. Help us help you.  [It's also worth noting you may be experiencing *mechanical noise* rather than *electrical noise*.](http://recordinghacks.com/2013/02/18/fixing-microphone-hum/)

It is also FAR more preferable to re-record the source than trying to remove noise after the fact.  Audio never comes out the other end unscathed. 

*****
Some examples of common noises:

[Cellphone/GSM noise](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1mlponX_jw)

[Buffer Underruns](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6Ysh7Y9_bI)

[Ground Loop](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSA2F1AwboU)

There isn't much you can do about Cellphone/GSM noise other than banning cellphones from the studio.  In my experience the noise doesn't travel all that far, you may be OK.  YMMV.  Even if your entire signal chain is balanced, the voice coils and/or internal wiring of your monitors can still pick it up.  If anyone has a better solution, let me know.

Buffer underruns can be fixed by increasing the size of the hardware buffer on your interface.  How to do this varies with different software and hardware, it is best to keep latency low during tracking and try to minimize the use of plugins during tracking to reduce load on the system.

Ground loops can be some of the most difficult problems to fix in the studio.  The recommended method of fixing a ground loop is through an isolation transformer or using a 'ground lift' IN THE AUDIO PATH.  FOR YOU OWN SAFETY

1365058407.0,1bnba7,How to record and mix bass - tips from a bass player,big_star,137,15,37,"This is in response to [this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/audioengineering/comments/1bi61o/good_vsts_for_di_bass_recording/)

There are a lot of myths and misconceptions about recording bass, engineer, and producer for a long time. In fact, one of the reasons I got behind the board was that I got sick of the crappy bass tones I was typically given on sessions, and I wanted to figure out how to make it better.

So here are some of my tips - YMMV of course

*Recording bass*

First and foremost

To do this, noise free signal. plug the bass into a DI or board interface, or use a high quality, low noise preamp if needed. I'm a big fan of anything API myself, so I'll usually ask for an API pre channel when I go into a session. (Not only does it sound great, but it lets the engineer know that you have a clue.)

I'd strongly recommend against using FX/plugins on the way in, bass “fits in” around other instruments, and recording a highly specific tone makes this very hard.

The ONLY exception to this rule is if you have an established band where bass FX/radical EQare part of the bass players' sound

Get as hot a signal as you can without distortion to tape

*Mic vs DI*

 DI is great all by itself; and it's the principal way I record commercial sessions. You don't need a super fancy boutique DI to get the job done (although some of them are pretty great) 

I'm a fan of using both DI and cab micing if you have the space and the mics

Make sure you thoroughly check for noise/artifacts on any bass amp head you use as a preamp/DI. These heads are made for live performance more than recording

*To compress or not to compress*

Bass is unique in that it contains a lot of transients – sudden volume spikes. You’ll need to record at a level that keeps the peaks from pushing into distortion

Compression is great at reducing the dynamic range

Basically, you can avoid compressing on the way in. Personally, I hate using compression during the recording phase.

Having said that


*FX* 

I'm a big fan of parallel FX – duplicate your track (or send multiple tracks to a bus). Put your FX on the duplicate track ONLY

Avoid over compressing bass. The most common bass mistake I hear is compressing it into indistinguishable mush.  Ideally
Remember that many FX processors and amp modelers have compression built in as part of their  sound.

Compression is great for tightening up the low end in a mix

*EQ*

The main thing to remember about bass is that it fills in the space BETWEEN other instruments. Unless you are crafting a solo bass opus, because it's emphasizing the frequencies the other instruments are NOT. Also, try to avoid the cliche “smiley face” EQ; there’s much more to mixing bass than that. Work from “flat”.

You're going to have to make several choices about where you want the bass to sit in the mix, 200-400hz is electric guitar and low piano. 

What you want to avoid at all costs is using compression instead of EQ. If you want the guitar to occupy the 200hz space

Take the time to do some critical listening to the style you are mixing. Nothing annoys me more than hearing the standard Rock Bass 101 sound slapped onto a jazz upright or blues track

Thanks for reading and I hope this helps.

EDIT: My first front page! Thanks guys and gals!

EDIT 2: Regarding recording levels -  This is a reply to another post

I should have been more clear on the recording level thing - you don't need to push it to the red these days like we did with tape

My point was, which creates problems if you want to compress the bass later.",,False,,t5_2qkby,1365112442.0,,

You all know the scene; You have just finished setting up a $30, even tho it is a darkened room in the middle of summer. So you go introduce your self to him and he just walks past you like you are jack shit. Once he takes off his sun glasses to try to find his booth he starts freaking out about how the equipment her personally requested and approved in the rider is not the equipment he thought it was. After he is done calling you and idiot, he finally makes due with the exact set up he asked you for. So you go back to your job for a few moments only to realize this guy is now repositioning the speakers you set up. Awesome, now you have to talk physics with 'DJ Bright Spark to prove your point. Or you tell him to take his fucking hands off of any thing that is not in his booth. So as you re set up every thing you just fine tuned you see him setting up some shitty budget studio monitors up on his desk, facing the dance floor. So now you can either have another talk about physics or simply remove the connection to his DJ rig. All of this being great fun. So after all of that is taken care of you notice the pictures on the wall are shaking and the floor is now vibrating to a degree that no longer makes you trust the structural integrity, only to hear DJ Muppet shout out 'Hey man, why is there no bass in this system?'

**Last night we went out with some good friends and had some long overdue drinks. After getting home at 4am and reading parts of this thread again




I recently signed on to go on tour for 3 months, I'm still trying to make order of everything..

A few weeks ago I responded to a craigslist ad looking for an AV person to go on tour with a Hispanic dance group that would be doing a 60 city tour at schools and theaters for 3 months. I have a degree in show production from Full Sail and also have a good bit of practical experience from numerous jobs and gigs I have worked. 

This group wanted a person to do the sound, and be the driver. I thought that was a bit much, but they reassured me they had one guy in the past that was able to do it all with ease. 

O ya- I was the only white guy in the group. Half of them spoke ok english

It was 2 weeks before the tour started and they asked to hire me as a consultant to set up all the gear and buy whatever may be needed. I agreed and started setting things up. 

I had a few garbage bags full of broken and half working cables and a bunch of half working gear that had been very ghetto-rigged over the years. initially I thought it wouldn't be too much work, and making some sense out of the mess I was given. 

I spent every day at this mansion the company owned (a 'non-profit organization') working on their gear, on the ocean (in Miami), and had boats and jet-ski's in back, and 2 brand new Mercedes Benz in the driveway. The address of this mansion is the official address of the organization. Meanwhile they had invested exactly $100 in a new 12 channel Behringer mixer from Guitar Center. It was absolute crap, but hey, it made sound come out, so it was good enough for them. 

From the very beginning I told them I would need a cue sheet of the performance

I stayed up late making a 6 page inventory list of every single piece of gear the company owned, to replace the mini-disc player they had been using for many years. I did buy a few cables and adapters and convinced my boss to buy me an outboard eq. I also bought 3 DI boxes for the 3 guitars. I learned that it was all wireless, so we wouldnt particularly need them, but they would be good to have if/when the guitar wireless transmitters are not working. I bought 1 from the company, leaving them two. I felt this was emergency insurance if a guitar transmitter goes bad and it would be good for us to keep them. (this is important later)  

I also asked, as I wasn't comfortable using the 10 yr old portable minidisk player they had been using for years. It had an adapter plugged into it, running to an RCA cable, to two couplers to another RCA cable, going into the wrong input. But hey it made sound come out, so they never saw a need to upgrade it. 


I was told we would have rehearsals all week

I plugged into the house system, but everything worked, and all my hard work payed off, we had a good show, and the owners were happy. O ya, there was a problem with the projector and we couldnt get an image to it. The boss arrives literally 5 minutes before the show started, and fixed the issue. with seconds to spare. Maybe it's just me, not show up 5 minutes before showtime holding a cup of starbucks. It is the first show after all..

I keep seeing this topic/question rear it's ugly head on this subreddit and /r/WeAreTheMusicMakers. I am making this post in hopes that I and others in the community that have knowledge and experience in this important aspect of recording can impart some of it to those that don't have as much knowledge or experience. I am also hoping this can get added to the sidebar so we can stop seeing this topic/question rear it's ugly head. Note

So you want to make recordings? Maybe you already have made one. Maybe you have made a couple and some of them sound great, you should begin to think about how you monitor your sound. That is, how sound gets from your monitors/speakers to your ears. First, you will need a ""trustworthy"" set of monitors if you don't have any. I put trustworthy in quotes because it doesn't ""matter"" what you buy. I put matter in quotes because it only matters what you buy as your ears become attuned to certain subtle sonic characteristics in music. Buy monitors with the best qualities you like that you can afford. Personally, I use Yamaha HS80Ms and have for years. I picked the HS80s some 5 years ago for a few reasons. The first was that they look like NS10s (rad!). The second, to my lesser-trained ears 5 years ago, those monitors sounded pristine compared to other options. Did I mention I got a crazy discount on them at the time? Oh, though

You have monitors. You are most likely in an apartment, or some combination of those three things. Maybe you are in a project studio in the G ""room"" that hardly passes for a drum booth. If you are the last option, I hate to say it, but you need a larger space. You can try to make small spaces work, but you really need at least a 10x10 room to dedicated completely to this. Room dimensions you say? Now is a good time to check out these ratios of ""ideal"" room ratios. Also, grab a tape measure and measure your room. Write it down, dummy.

**Height**:**Width**:**Length**

**1.00**:**1.14**:**1.39**

**1.00**:**1.28**:**1.54**

**1.00**:**1.60**:**2.33**



courtesy of Ethan Winer http://www.ethanwiner.com/acoustics.html

If you have a room that falls into this ratio, but it comes closest to the second. The dimensions of my apartment bedroom studio are 8'x10'x13'. Why does this matter? Modes!

Room modes, as long as the listener places their ears anywhere in front of the monitors they will hear essentially every frequency at equal volumes. Your mileage may vary. In apartment bedroom studios it is close to impossible to get rid of all of your room modes. Why? Something something parallel walls, square dimensions, sheet rock. What we can do is tailor a specific area that sounds accurate and depending on how well you do this your area can grow quite large! So how exactly does a room mode get created? As you know, all things resonate at a fundamental frequency, even you. Rooms are no different and the size of your room is actually part of a wave form. If you have your audio unit converter handy, convert 16' into hertz. You should get close to 70hz. That means 70hz takes 16' to go from 0 to +1 to 0 to -1 and back to 0. That is

Waveforms have the most energy when they are changing polarity. That is, speakers are striking the walls through convection of air.

You can calculate your room modes here. http://www.bobgolds.com/Mode/RoomModes.htm

If you calculated your room modes you will notice that all of the frequencies fall in a pattern. Halves and doubles, 280, 560, and possibly even 1120. (You know I did, playboy.) Mind you, this is just for the height of my room! You might be thinking of quitting now, but don't

You know what your room modes are, some reflections can be good. 

Reflections, because the word itself says nothing of the direction of the reflected wave which is important if we're trying to direct excess frequencies away from our ears. There is a specific class of reflectors called diffusers that cause reflections to splay out in lots of random directions instead of one consistently unknown location. As far diffusers go, the beauty is in the curved surface that reflects in infinitely random directions. I have some reflectors in place to balance the color of my room. All rooms will need a balance of all materials. Some things in your room can be used as reflectors. Flat walls are reflectors. I use a combination of strategically placed absorbers and the existing walls to achieve my most accurate results.

Ok, and/or diffusers? With mirrors. I used a handheld mirror with a hole in the handle just small enough for a push pin to pin the mirror to the wall. I pinned the mirror to the wall, sat in my chair, and looked to see if I could see any portion of my speaker in it. If I could see the woofer I made a mark of it on the wall. If I could see the tweeter, I made that mark, too. I went all the way around the room except for behind the monitors where I knew I would be placing a broadband absorber. I have also made a large effort to pull the monitors off of the wall. Walls have a nasty proximity effect, if your ears or your monitors sit too close to them you will notice. In the end I ended up putting one absorber behind each monitor hanging vertically

I decided to setup up my room with the longest wall in front of me, it would not work if I wanted to work in the room. Ok, modes, my ""front to back"" mode is 55hz. Yikes! The complimentary frequency spread includes lots of low frequencies. I went super hard on broadband absorbers and stuffed my acoustic panels with rock wool. Rock wool and acoustic fiberglass will absorb frequencies as low as 125hz. Fun fact, HS80Ms aren't behemoths when it comes to producing 85hz and under so I don't have to worry ""much"" about that. I have easily 4"" of rock wool in my front and back panels and it cleans up that room mode nicely. For those pesky short walls I ended up putting a bookshelf stocked with heavy books, vinyl, and cables on the window side and free standing broadband absorbers on the closet side. I also hung curtains (on the rare occasion I want a brighter sound in the room I draw the curtains to reveal shiny plastic sliding closet doors). The main idea here is I wanted to put as much mass as I could between the speakers where they reflect off the wall and the walls. I don't have any figures to back this up, low frequencies pools where planes meet). One corner is occupied by a gigantic square armchair (another bass trap

I want to double back to that thing I said about your ears distance from the floor. This fact is why studios with hardwood floors sound so nice. For my studio I went out and bought one of those hard plastic office mat rollers. It makes a world of difference.

**Don't let stacked hanging panels touch. The one on the bottom will fall.***

Anywhoo. To the meat of it. I raised money last year for my band [The Red Heroes](http://theRedHeroes.bandcamp.com) to record our album. We contacted this guy ( I won't name names. Though I want to.) who does all of the local bands recordings, and he thought he would have extra balance left over, and he would pass it on to the Mastering guy, to get us started on that. Sounded like a plan. We hire us a studio drummer, and get some practice in, and go to the studio, and record. He doesn't want click tracks, so we just record scratches to get the drums sounding great.

There is a little bit of studio drama, we had used 24 hours, paid for 48, and he was going to start mixing.

I was shooting a film at the time, so I can have underscore for the film. He says sure. He quotes about a week of turnaround.

Two weeks pass by, he said that he wasn't going to charge me for that, but was letting me know he didn't have any money left over for the Mastering. He sends me the mix, and it's kind of shit. It's not mastered, which is a lot of it, but we just weren't happy with it. We made a page and a half of notes of what we wanted different, and he said that it would take too much work, totalling 325

My lead singer's dad paid that for us

Which brings us to last night. I ask him how it's going, and for the most part, I love it. But there were exactly 5 things we wanted changed, that we were agreed shouldn't take that long (There were some problems that persisted from the fact that we didn't do click tracks, but we let them slide. No one would know but us that that part is faster.)

They were things like ""Less Mike Vocals on song X"" or ""Less reverb on the girl vocals"" etc. There was one, and in the right key, so it's not that big of a deal.

I send the notes to him, and he says (Copied from my text messages):

&gt;Alright those things are something that gets fixed in the mix. I'm going to be out of town for about a week, it's the analog world so it's new mixes all around...

I feel he's trying to get extra money from me again

First off: We recorded digitally. We recorded onto a computer using Windows. I don't know the software

Second off: This whole starting over from scratch because you have to adjust one level seems completely made up. It could be that it's his workflow, and renders it out at the end, and that's it. But that's dumb, and I shouldn't have to pay for his workflow inadequacies.

Third off: We wanted to have this album done

Is this guy slacking off, and making me pay, or trying to swindle me?

I just kind of want to get out of there.

What should I do?

I could say ""Oh, etc. So we can fuck around with it"" but then take it to someone else to re-master it (or, if it turns out that he is fulla shit, and it is as easy as lowering the volume on the guitar, etc. Do it myself.)

Or, and I should suck it up and pay.

That's why I came to you guys. You know the business and technology more

1370106148.0,1fgysm,"Hello r/audioengineering, with your help I have developed an iPhone app for generating adaptive noise that lets you to block distracting noises when you want to sleep or concentrate. The app was published yesterday and during the next 24 hours you can get it for free.",flo_vonderuni,60,12,http://www.reddit.com/r/audioengineering/comments/1fgysm/hello_raudioengineering_with_your_help_i_have/

--------

This app lets you generate ""smart"" noise, the adaptation can be optionally switched off, and then the app just generates white noise that you can still filter using the bandpass filter.

These are the functions of the user interface elements: 

* Start/Stop: At the top there is a button to turn the noise generation on and off. As an alternative you can use the play/pause button of your headset with remote control. 

* Timeout: You may set a timeout of up to 24 hours after which the noise will be gradually faded out over 20 seconds

* Enable adaptation: This lets you choose if you want the noise to remain constant (off) or if it should adapt to the sounds around you (on). The next three settings are only available when adaptation is enabled. 

* Setting for noise floor: You can add some additional white noise into the process. This signal is also subjected to the bandpass filter (see below). 

* Setting for Attack: On a per-frequency basis

* Setting for Decay: On a per-frequency basis

* Bandpass: This lets you filter the frequency range of the generated noise. Only the frequencies above the first setting and below the second setting will be let through. Make sure to have the first slider lower than the second one

* Amplification: This setting determines the amplification of the generated noise before it is send to a compressor that limits the volume. When you want the app to react strongly to the environmental sounds, so the output is not compressed. 

* Frequency chart. The frequency chart shows the frequency distribution inside the range that you set in the bandpass filter. Here you can watch the effects of different attack and decay settings. 

Recommended usage scenarios: when you want to use the app for falling asleep it is recommended to use it with your device's built-in speaker if you want to use the non-adaptive mode. If you want to use the adaptive mode instead it's best to use headphones because a headset will pick up more noises from your movements and breath. In this case, it would be best to use it with a headset with remote and mic, so as not to pick up the noises from touching the device.

**EDIT: Thank you all for downloading and upvoting. The promotion has now ended. The app is now on sale for $0.99. Even if you still see the price as free, it's not my fault.**

After 14 grueling business days with many calls to the post office they finally say enough time has past for me to file a report. I talk to my rep, and I only insured it for $3000 so I was obviously reluctant to settle for the insurance. 7 days later no updates on the case and no package. So I file a claim.

About a month later (2 months after shipping it) I get a check in the mail for $1924.68 including $47.60 of refunded shipping. $1

I turned to the manufacturers of the equipment, but those who wanted to help were unable to provide me with what I needed. I did my best with what they could provide, but my first appeal was denied.

What are your tricks for getting great heavy mixes (assuming the underlying tracks are well-recorded?)

I'll go first with what I've learned recently:

* low-pass guitars before compressing them - often in the 7-10k range.   I've been liking an 8k low-pass lately.  compress with 1176 style compression and don't be afraid to smash them.  when smashing you may have some luck retaining depth by doing parallel compression alongside the uncompressed guitars

* don't be afraid to distort the bass.  this could be done by saturating an analog eq, or by re-amping the signal with a nice amp.  compress the bass considerably and add a hair of EQ post-compression at 3-5k to get the distortion to open up again from the darkening effects of the eq.

* don't be afraid to get weird with the bass.  the bass is mostly there to lock the guitars to the drums.  I've actually been enjoying adding an 85ms stereo delay to the bass and easing that into the mix.  It gives the distorted bass that ""flying apart sound"" that can enhance the guitars.  Make sure to reference your mix in mono to make sure you aren't f'ing the whole bass phase up

Basically for the first time I understand why the 1176 and its offspring are such rock icons.  They make things sound LOUD!

I'm still learning in this area.  Divulge your secrets!  In particular I want to know how to get the really spacious but heavy Andy Sneap metal drum sound. (like http://grooveshark.com/#!/s/Ignite/4FbB4b?src=5)

His studio's business is about 50/50 music/voiceover, and it was mentioned off-hand that once I'm no longer an intern the way my boss envisioned it was I would pull clients in and work with them at his studio independently of the work he does at his studio, and just pay him rent for his space/equipment on each session while I could charge whatever additional I want.

I was just hoping maybe someone could offer some guidance to me; lately I've been doing a lot of stuff for free, and more specifically musical audio.

This week I was lucky to get a good deal on the Beatles in Mono collection

* ""Please Please Me"" and ""With the Beatles"" - so sonically clear and *rocking*. There are lots of songs that stand out as being so much better than the mushy

Its almost like hearing these albums for the first time. What really strikes me is how good these albums were as a debut and their follow-up. You get the feeling that these same two albums released today - would still be smash hits. 

""Beatles for Sale"" is also a big improvement with songs like ""Eight Days a Week"" sounding some much more punchy

There are some real other gems on the album ""Ticket to Ride"" is so much fuller. Has a real punchiness to it - you can really hear the individual vocal lines so much clearer. 

However, but all of them sound completely new. Even tracks that was previously not featured tracks like ""She's Leaving Home"". Wow. The strings/harp are so clear...sounds like they are 10ft away. Kinda pointless to describe the rest of the album, since every track is so much improved. So many clear things that you simply can't hear on the stereo version (the counting in the middle of ""A Day In The Life"" during the orchestra rise...and when Paul's diddy comes in....ahhh what a beautiful transition). 

Enough blabbering. Have others heard this masterpiece yet? And other favorite mono albums you like over their stereo counterparts?

Obviously I plan to pitch-correct the hell out of this when we're finished, if one of the songs starts on C, she can't hit it. So i've gone through and taken all of the instrumentation to start on G, which seems to be the note she can hit easiest.

Studio production invests a lot of time on the front end of the music-listening experience.  Hours are spent dialing in tones to make them perfect.  The way a certain condenser mic interacts with a certain preamp.  The way a certain overdub fits in the mix just right.  The way a great mastering engineer emphasizes the power of a song while still keeping it dynamic and listenable.  

But the ultimate result of all this hard work is often reduced to a 128kbps mp3 that is played back on some shitty earbuds on a crowded subway car.  While lots of effort is put in on the front end of recording sessions

Live sound is about the replication.  The source material may be less than perfect; the performances are one take, and you are right there along side of them.

Are the local house sound guys just wimps or is there some sort of rule that says YOU can't touch their levels?,japaneseknotweed,39,9,49,"Honestly
Sorry this is long

I keep going to shows by well-reviewed indie groups known for edgy/rootsy instrumentals
I go home pissed and tired from the sheer effort of trying to hear the music through the noise.

I live in a semi-rural but intellectual/artsy/funky area.  
The audiences are small but loyal
The venues are also small -- converted churches, parallel walls, and never enough money to buy adequate pipe-and-drape. Bangy as hell and easily overloaded. The kind of places Old Crow Medicine Show or Grace Potter started out.

The house sound people are excellent

I'm a musician too so I know most of them; I've been asking ""what gives?"" after the bad shows and the answer is always the same: they point to the onstage amps

These are guys who know their venues, and it's their name on the lease.

So why don't they get to decide the onstage amp levels? Tell the band ""*this* is where you want to set them for this house, brushes instead of baseball-bat-gauge sticks? 

I play violin. In a symphony, and if he tells the horns to back off they damn well have to back off.

I also play oldtime fiddle, learn to hear each other through the background wash *before* we start playing escalation games with the monitors. The bass player sets his amp close and checks with all of us, sound guy included, to make sure it's not screwing up the balance.

Why isn't it this way in a cabaret/club venue? You're the ones whose reputations are on the line if the final mix sucks

**tl;dr: the sound guys around here never tell the touring bands that their onstage amps are too loud for the venue. Are they too nice? Or is it a country/city thing? Or is there an unspoken industry-wide code,,False,,t5_2qkby,False,,True

Here's a few things that might help (and hopefully reduce the amount of repeat threads). All of this can also be used for those of you who are recording tutorial videos for other programs. For using screen capture software and recording the output of Pro Tools or LIVE or any other DAW that uses ASIO drivers

The following refers to PC. The same concepts will apply to mac users

_

**Q: What should I record the video with?**

**A:** FRAPS. Period. Buy it

_

**Q: What about my commentary? I have X mic and Y interface.**

**A:** Whatever you have will probably do

_

**Q: How do I record my voice over the video?**

**A:** There are a few ways. One way is to set FRAPS to record an external input. Go to the Movie tab and tick the ""record from external input"" box. Then select your interface from the menu. The other way is to record the daw into a DAW

_

**Q: Why is my commentary panned to the far left or right?**

**A:** Windows is probably interpreting your interface's microphone input as part of a stereo pair. What you can do to fix this:

* The easiest way is to set your audio to mono when you transcode (see the question about transcoding below).
* another easy way is to use a video editor or DAW to open the video
* Another way is to record your commentary later into a DAW. You'll have control over panning
* The third option: if you would rather do live commentry, and has two outputs. Both can be used simultaneously. Simply connect one output to your interface's first line input, the other preamp output to the interface's second line input. Now your vocals are centered.

_

**Q: You mentioned recording the commentary into a DAW

**A:** You can actually record live into Audacity (free recording program) while you record your video

_


**Q: What if I want to do voiceover

**A:** Remember how we brought audio recorded with Audacity into our video editor? It's the same deal

_

**Q: What are some good video editors that let me import audio to merge with the video?**

**A:** If you already have a DAW, and Logic all can import and save video files. Most video editors can do this, such as Final Cut, Adobe Audition, Magix Movie Edit, Sony Music Studio, etc.


_

**Q: FRAPS splits my movies into pieces. What do I do?**

**A:** Combine them in your movie editor. They are timestamped, you're ready to transcode the video and upload it.


_

**Q: Transcode? What's that?**

**A:** FRAPS records raw video. This takes up a huge amount of space - this is partly why it splits the files. Transcoding is the process of taking video and re-encoding it. In this case, with the quality slider set fairly high. Same goes for any other video editor. For YouTube uploads, you want to use MP4 compressed with the H.264 codec, at anywhere from 25 to 30 frames per second (it's always good to either go with the same framerate you recorded with in FRAPS. However, if you recorded 60fps with FRAPS, transcode to 30 before uploading) and ALWAYS keep the audio at ""same quality"" or ""use original"".


_

**Q: Okay

**A:** Transcoding with the H.264 codec can reduce your file size without much quality loss. It's a huge difference. Earlier today I converted 1.42GB of 1080p uncompressed FRAPS footage into a MP4 that only took 9.75 MB. My reduced file was still 1080p and still looked great. You absolutely need to transcode before uploading.

_




**Q: What do *you* use to do this stuff?**




**A:** I record footage of different things (Reason and Pro Tools usually, going to my interface's channels 1 and 2 (we discussed this method above). If I ever need to change something or re-do some of my commentary, I import the video into Pro Tools, edit the audio and re-record voice as necessary, and then export the audio as a WAV file. Finally I use VirtualDub to join the segments with the ""append AVI segment"" command, use the ""replace audio"" command to select my newly recorded WAV file, and finally transcode with the settings I mentioned in this post. Then I upload to YouTube or Vimeo.


_

**Q: What if I want to record footage that isn't a video game?**

**A:** Usually FRAPS only records DirectX or OpenGL video. FRAPS has the option of ""Monitor Aero Desktop (DWM)"", regardless of whether it uses DirectX or OpenGL. Once this has been done, you're free to record as above - with one caveat.
* Chances are, FRAPS can capture it.
_


**Q: This all seems really complicated. How can I make it more streamlined?**




**A:** It's only complicated on paper. As long as you have some notes to refer to, and keep in mind that the guys from major gaming channels on YouTube have a lot of experience and know-how, and they sometimes have a production team to handle this stuff for them. Just keep at it, follow tutorials, and stay on top of your audio knowledge.

_

**Q: I have a question that has not been answered

**A:** comment below. I'm not an expert on this stuff

The situation is this: we have a clutch of invaluable tapes of oral history from South Africa

I lucked into an Akai X-IV via ebay, and honestly I have no idea what the complications could be of trying to use a different brand of recorder or player beyond that.  My search for another X-IV or X-V has produced nothing else for over a year.

So my question is this: can anyone help my quest for recommendations of other brands or models of player/recorder that can handle 5"" reels, provided they'll do the job.  The only catch is that it can't be a big console unit--I have to take this in luggage to SA from the US, and the portable ones are pretty universally global in voltage whereas the consoles are hit or miss on that point.  If needed I can provide more information based on the X-IV I have here (re: range of speeds, any physical indicators of recording method, etc).

Second of all

Do we even want to record exactly in roper stereo? Is it possible? Let's take drum overheads as an example... On one side, and on the other, low toms, and a very harmonic rich cymbal... It does not seem to matter much about how 'matched' our mics are, as we are clearly miking two very different instruments here. I started experimenting with using two different microphones, and then two different microphone types for my overheads... I find a ribbon on the HH side, and an LDC on the ride side work great together. Should have seen my school trained assistant freak out at that one haha. 

As for stereo room mics, and we would just be working in mono again. Not that you will ever get a 100% symmetrical room to work with anyways.

&gt;Why Microphones are More Important than Preamps

&gt;I just happened to stumble across a nearly three year old post I made to a very popular thread at Gearslutz - one of many similar threads that ask

&gt;I'm re-posting what I wrote then

&gt;Context first - the original question ... 

----------------------

&gt;""Quote:
Originally Posted by drak12

&gt;- or is it like the SOS (magazine) conclusion in the review of the Liquid Channel Preamp?: ""the differences might be a little too subtle in circumstances where there are bigger hurdles to overcome than choosing between different preamps"".
As we can see, asks ""do some preamps add a significant and noticeable improvement to the sound? Or are the differences ""too subtle...""?""

-----------------------

&gt;Now my post from October 2010 ....

&gt;My quick answer (with exposition to follow) - in the context Low End Theory engineers and musicians find themselves in

&gt;In my opinion

&gt;An Alchemist of sound is one who can transmute seemingly inert tools and materials into metaphysically active conduits of Intention in order to deliver or elicit

&gt;Some tools

&gt;...a microphone is an Energy Transformer - it responds to sound energy and transforms this into electrical energy. Energy transformation is by definition Alchemical. Note that we, the energy expended by our muscles acts (kinetic energy) upon stretched strings (stored potential energy) to produce sound (acoustical wave particle energy) from a guitar. 

&gt;A preamplifier on the other hand is a an energy amplification device. It does not transmute energy from one form to another - it only makes stronger the particular energy form presented to its input. 

&gt;Because of the complexities and inefficiencies inherent in the energy transformation process (impedance matching one energy system to another and non-linear energy losses in the process are two examples) these energy conversion tools offer users both profound and subtle access paths to, a microphone is intimately responsive to users who approach it mindfully and with Intent. The microphone becomes a living partner in the selective transformation of energy under the direction of the musician / engineer. How is this partnership played out?

&gt;Because a recording microphone operates in three dimensional acoustic space

&gt;A preamp on the other hand offers far more restricted user access to its fundamental operating parameters. One can operating the preamp in its distortion-free linear zone or choose to overdrive it. That's it. There is no way for the user of a preamp to affect the basic Alchemical properties of that preamp in a way to modulate its functioning and thus impress Intent. A preamplifier is largely unresponsive to user Intent. 

&gt;So given the context and budget restraints of Low End Theory practitioners - it seems much more prudent to allocate resources - time and money - to the tools that offer the greatest return on investment and which most affectively allow the musician / engineer to be more fully engaged in the magical processes of conveying and eliciting emotion. 

&gt;To my mind, it is an energy transformer), and because of the near-infinite possibilities inherent in its usage, is a far more important tool to the sound Alchemist than a preamp, which has far more restricted Alchemical possibilities when one is trying to make sound magic.
 
&gt;Thanks for reading!

I've been working successfully as a tracking and mix engineer in nice big studios for about or 9 or 10 years now doing good work. Records I've done have been nominated for the highest prize you can get in my country...but i think i might be burned out. Ready to give it all up. 

The main problem is I'm incredibly hard on myself. I know this is a psychological thing but i kinda feel like its what makes me good at my job. I'm almost never ever satisfied with a mix in the moment im doing it. But because I work in expensive rooms. I mix to whatever budget the client has. Alot of the time I'll print a mix on a big analog board with tonnes of outboard, but in the moment of committing to a mix i can't just save and come back to I almost never like them. I truly convince myself my mix sucks. The only reason i finnish is because of budget or i legitimately can't find anything else to do to the track to make it more impressive. I know that that's a common place to know you've finnished. But my problem is I DONT LIKE THE MIX IN THAT MOMENT....almost EVER. It makes me very anxious and maintaining good bedside manner and inspiring confidence in my clients while im not convinced about my own work has put a lot of stress on me. Also how can my perspective as a Mixer be so skewed to the negative in the most crucial moment of a mix? Committing.

I'll reveal more information about the masters shortly. In the meantime

http://zirconstudios.com/shootout/
(*fixed link*)

**Which master do you prefer? Why? Which do you think is the high-end mastered version

Note: These are NOT subtle differences...!

---

**UPDATE**: Thanks for sharing your thoughts! Here's the full info.

The album is [""Identity Sequence""](http://zirconstudios.bandcamp.com/album/identity-sequence)

Version A was my own master.

Version B was John's.

Some interesting things to note:

* The self-mastered version was created as I mixed and produced the album. This is how I normally work

* I mix and master everything on Beyerdynamic DT880 headphones. No monitors. I actually think these are excellent references and I can clearly hear all the differences between my original master and John's version. 

* My fans greatly preferred my own master (A) to John's (B)

* John and I talked about how he would approach the mastering - we both agreed on a softer dynamic with more punch. I'm ultimately very happy with what he did because given the nature of the music

* Since the album came out, looking back, I actually think he dampened the highs a bit too much and added a little too much extra compression. If you look at an analysis of both WAVs you will see that his version has a marked decrease in the very high end 'shimmer' compared to my version. I personally miss that despite the increased clarity in the 8-10khz range.

* Ozone was not used anywhere in this process :)",,t5_2qkby,1368516996.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/audioengineering/comments/1e9j43/mastering_shootout_ultrahigh_end_studio_vs_home/

I don't want to pull his mic down to kill the feedback only to have him come up into the next phrase too quickly for me to bring it back to where it was.

I'm running a Mac Mini (2.6GHz quad-core, Pro Tools 10), and need a new audio interface for home use. I do mostly post production, and not too much recording. So it's mostly just for an output, but I like having the option to record stuff if I need to (a rough VO, some foley, or quick ADR). I also do a little bit of music recording for fun

I really like the look of the AKAI EIE Pro, which I still use from time to time). However, I've been reading some mixed reviews. I see a lot of people love the unit, but some people are experiencing noise with the phantom power on, and random ""hits"" of white noise while recording/playback, and sometimes the noise won't go away until you restart the unit. Also, I've read a few problems with running 24 bit and 96kHz.

I was wondering if anybody still uses this unit, or any other problems. The reviews I've been seeing are quite old, and I'm hoping the new firmware and drivers solves these annoying problems.

On that note, I'm not much into recording, but having 4 XLR/1/4"" inputs to record with if choose to is a pretty good selling point. I'd rather have 4 I/O than just 2. It's also got MIDI (to sync with my MPC), VU meters, and a sleek look to it.

As I am getting ready to set up my first home studio I am looking at the computer to run my DAW on. I have a medium to high-end home computer. However I would rather have this computer in a different room. So I've decided to get myself a laptop to run my DAW on and use for anything else recording-related. But I have no clue what processing power the laptop would need. I would be running either Sonar or Reaper (I haven't decided yet

**TL;DR: What kind of processing power would a laptop need to run DAW's?**

**Edit 1:**
Thanks veryone for the very informative replies! A sea of information with which I can most definitely work! I already posted this as a reply to someone earlier today

Another couple of questions. If you could answer them I would quite appreciate it.
 1.7200 rpm is a must or could I go with 5400 rpm for my second drive?
 2.Finding a laptop with a Firewire connection (for both an audio interface which I already own which is both FW and USB compatible) is quite tough. USB 3.0 is truly good enough?
 3.Could you take a look at a couple of examples I have been looking at?
 •Lenovo IdeaPad Y580 (I am also looking at the other laptops in this series
 
This is mostly a gaming laptop
 •Lenovo Thinkpad Twist S230u: http://shop.lenovo.com/SEUILibrary/controller/e/web/LenovoPortal/en_US/catalog.workflow:item.detail?GroupID=37&amp;Code=TWIST_BETTER_SAP&amp;category_id=FA4F841D9789D55CA8028C8C3A1EC325
 
This page doesn't show the SSD
 •Lenovo ThinkPad Edge S430: http://shop.lenovo.com/gbweb/gb/en/laptops/thinkpad/thinkpad-edge/s430
 
Same as above but with upgradable RAM so I can get it up to 8GB.

Now, lower price-range would drop to about $750)?

Today I had to bring his wedges up so hot it was causing phasing with his headset and was on the verge of feedback. He said afterwards that he couldn't hear himself

Today was hot and very humid due to heavy rain yesterday. There are more storm systems moving in so the air preassure is likely high as well. The maintenance guys don't turn on the AC untill Sunday morning for some reason as well so it was a little warm and humid in the room as well. 

we tend to get some slap back in the room and it seems like it changes with temperature/humidity conditions. Is this true/possible to have audible changes in room characteristics with changes in weather? if so

tl;dr Is it physically possible for changes in weather (temperature/humidity/barometric preassure) to affect acoustics to an audible degree?

I'm thinking the ART just because it has a bass roll-off

Anyone?  Or just go with whatever is cheapest and deal with it until I get my Saffire...

I work as an audio engineer for a medium sized production company. I entered around November as an assistant. About a month ago, I didn't care it was minimum wage with the promise of salary soon.

So, I need the income regardless of how little it is. My wife and I make enough money to get by but it is not cutting it anymore. And there are no jobs around. It's a wonder how I even fell into this position.

My question: What would an audio engineer like yourself do in my position? What do I say if the owner lowballs me? 

I'm just tired of life lately. My life is a continuous struggle and I'm tired of it. All I want is a job that pays decent. Seriously

Will things get better eventually? Or should I just suck it up and become a damn factory worker and hate the rest of my life? Honestly

**Edit** - I should mention a couple of things I left out. I'm not in the music industry. I do a lot of voice over work and I even edit video. This isn't a situation I can't handle

My steps:  
1) Start with a 32bit 44.1k test file from one of the Chesky Reference Discs.  
2) Turn the gain of the audio down -60dB.  
3) Change the bit-depth from 32bit to 16bit
4) Follow the same steps above, Powr3, MBIT+ dither shapes before truncation.  
5) Reimport the resulting files.  
6) Normalize the files to 0dB.  
7) Listen to the results.  

**Note: All dithering was done with default settings. PowrX examples were done in WaveBurner and MBIT+ was done in Triumph.**

I used Ozone on the master out, and even that was very subtle. Like I said I was happy with the mix so didn't want to blow anything away with the mastering. Bit depth was set at 16 on the oZone loudness maximizer, and the bounce dialogue of Logic. 

Though the final track sounds not *as good* as it did in the session.  It tended to sound a little bit boomy in the low-mids. More so anyway than when I was mixing. I think this is the bit rate of 16?  What else do I need to check for?
