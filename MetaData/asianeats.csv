1328841449.0,pirrb,"The best soup I've ever made, may I present to you, Mapo Ramen (xpost from r/cooking)",x3n0s,50,7

This soup combines one of my favorite Sichuanese dishes, sweet, and made with some different ingredients. I love the authentic Sichuanese version of the dish so I used that as a base instead of the altered Japanese version.  It was the best soup I've ever made, I think I may have to try more combinations like this. Recipe follows.

Ingredients:

* 2 packages chuckasoba (Japanese Chinese style noodles aka ramen)
* 1.5 tbls peanut oil
* 1/2lbs ground pork
* 1 block of soft tofu (19oz)
* 1 tbls diced ginger
* 1 tbls diced garlic
* 3 thinly sliced scallions
* 2 tbls Sichuanese chili bean paste
* 2 tbls Chinese fermented black beans
* 1.5 tsp sichuan pepper corns
* 2 tsp ground white pepper 
* 2 tsp dried chili flakes
* 1 tbls Shoaxing wine (or dry sherry)
* 1 tbls sesame oil

Sauce ingredients:

* 1 tbls dark soy
* 1 tbls light soy
* 1 tbls Chinese red vinegar
* 2 tbls mirin
* 28 oz chicken stock

Method:

Cook noodles until al dente. Rinse noodles in cold water.
Mix all soup ingredients
Toast Sichuan peppercorns in a dry wok on about mid-high for about 4-5 minutes until toasted. Grind peppercorns and add to soup.
Season your wok

Push pork to one side of the wok, move to the side, drain oil again, and add black beans, cook for about 10 seconds then slightly mash them your wok spatula. Mix everything back together. Add tofu then wine, and mix to combine while being careful not to break the tofu up.

Add pepper, simmer for 30 seconds, remove from heat and stir in sesame oil. Put noodles in bowl and ladle soup over them, garnish with a few pieces of scallion greens.

Serves 2-3

Disclaimer: All measurements are just an approximation.  I typically never measure and just go by sight and taste.


Add to a small pot:

Chicken (enough for a meal

2 cups water (cover the chicken mostly).

1 tsp. pepper.

1 TB salt.

1/2 tsp chinese 5 spice.

1 clove minced garlic.

1 TB rice vinegar.

1 TB chili powder.

Boil everything and let it simmer until the chicken is cooked through.  15 mins maybe give or take.  Add in some rice noodles and let them cook.  Throw your junk in a bowl, basil, and a sliced jalepeno.


Slightly less easy:  Same as above


I go with all sorts of variations:

Any type of noodle will do really.

Use rice instead of noodles.

Add spinach, etc.

Instead of a jalepeno at the end

Instead of basil

Hell

......................................................................

**BBQ Pork and Wonton Noodle Soup Recipe**

**INGREDIENTS** (serves two people with large appetites)

- Whatever [wontons](http://www.taste.com.au/images/articles/untitled-102121315.jpg) you like

- Guestimated serving qty of [BBQ pork](http://s3-media2.ak.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/7PepCtEbQ-GI3OwCxwOPDg/l.jpg) purchased from a take away chinese store you see meat hanging in the windows (I buy $10 worth

- Your preferred brand of [egg noodles](http://www.visualphotos.com/photo/2x2341252/pasta_-_asian_noodles_-_egg_noodles_pas055.jpg) (don't use 2min noodles

- Bunch of [Pak choy](http://www.wingyipstore.co.uk/pictures/content1479/baby+pak+choi.jpg) with most of white portion cut off so you just have the green leaves (or bok choy or other leafy spinach like vegetable)

- 1 small Carrot julienned 

- Teaspoon-ish of thinly sliced Ginger root

- Small bunch of [spring onion](http://www.foodsubs.com/Photos/greenonions5.jpg)

- Handfull [dried sliced shitake mushrooms](http://www.asianfoodgrocer.com/img/prods/dried-foods/296006-mushroom-slice-lg.jpg)

- [Chinese rice wine](http://www.foodsubs.com/Photos/chinesericewine.jpg) (can use dry sherry if you can't find it)

- 2L Chicken stock

- Soy sauce

- [Fish Sauce](http://www.siaea.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/fish-sauce.jpg)

- [Shrimp paste](http://www.shoptheeast.com/1111-325-large/lee-kum-kee-shrimp-sauce-finely-ground-8-oz.jpg) &lt;-- very important

**METHOD**

Start making the broth by adding chicken stock, 2x 2inch spring onion stems (the white bit, not the green leaf), and thinly sliced ginger to a pot on a medium heat and bring to a simmer. Simmer for a few minutes then taste.. it probably won't have a full brothy flavour.. yet.

Add a generous dash of soy sauce and chinese rice wine

Now it's time to tweak the flavour. 

Season with salt and I usually add a little more soy sauce and incrementally more shrimp paste until the broth has a good [umami](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umami) flavour. Once it's to your liking

Rehydrate the egg noodles as per packet instructions (3 bulbs of egg noodles is a decent serving for 2 people) With the egg noodle I use the packet says 3min in boiling water to soften

Bring a saucepan of water to the boil and cook your wontons

**ASSEMBLY**

Add cooked wontons to bottom of large bowls. Add noodles, juliened carrots and BBQ pork. Ladle in broth to a decent level (try to leave behind all the floaty broth additives you don't really want them in your bowl). Garnish with diagonally sliced spring onion.

BAM! Serve and impress!

That said, with a small amount of prep time. Once cooked, served with white rice.

These are my must-haves in the kitchen:

* Red Onions
* Shallots
* Ginger
* Light Soy Sauce
* Dark Soy Sauce
* Oyster Sauce
* Worcestershire Sauce
* Sesame Oil

With these, chicken and pork. Some of my favourite dishes like [Sesame Oil Chicken](http://rasamalaysia.com/recipe-sesame-oil-chicken/2/) can be made with just these ingredients.

You oil up a pan, add some ground pork or something meaty, take it easy on the meat as it's expensive and mostly for flavour, you add some sauce you like, a bit of thickener perhaps, add your leafy greens, you wilt the greens and you're good.

Second dish, bean sprouts, some craziness mushrooms or some other type of fungal growth (reconstitute those suckers), add some worms (the little dried worms with eyes that are actually fish), or just add some type of meat again for flavour, and that's dish 2.

Then you're going to go with a tofu dish.  Soup would be one way

You're going nuts and adding more dishes?  It will be some variation of the above.  Do watch out for bitter melon or whatever it is as I've found most jerks can't cook it right.

Anyhow, add the junk you cooked on top and consume.  Put that bowl right up to your mouth and shovel it in with chopsticks and make crazy noises like you've been starving for weeks.  Ha, awesomeness.",,False,self,t5_2sysy,,http://www.reddit.com/r/asianeats/comments/l7lbb/typical_chinese_dinner/

1318297624.0,l7rq6,"Laab, Thai Pork Salad, the way my friend taught me",calinet6,6,7, chicken, fish sauce

I just made this tonight, but has too much focus on chilis and adds cilantro, which... no, just no). So I figured I'd share the recipe I know with you guys.

**Laab**

Ingredients:

* **1 lb ground Meat** (pref. Pork
* **2 limes**
* **2 medium-sized shallots**
* 3-5 sprigs (or ~10-15 large leaves) of **fresh mint** OR **fresh Keffir lime leaves** (if you can't find fresh Keffir lime leaves
* **1 tbsp Fish Sauce** (pref. Tipparos)
* **Crushed Asian Red Chili flakes** (to taste)
* **3 tbsp uncooked rice for Toasted Rice Powder** (OR pre-made Toasted Rice Powder
* **2 cups rice** (pref. Thai jasmine rice) to cook.
* **1 head** of green leaf or Boston lettuce (either works; I prefer Boston for flavor

What you'll need:

* A large pot (not a stockpot
* If making the toasted rice powder yourself: a coffee grinder used for spices

**First: Toasted (or Roasted) Rice Powder (TRP)**

If you don't have this already or can't find it in the store, and you can make a good amount to use for this dish in the future (it saves very well). [This page has a good example of making TRP](http://taste-for-adventure.tablespoon.com/2011/01/10/thai-larb-gai/ ""But seriously, ignore the rest of the recipe... it's overloaded with peppers."") with photos of what it should look like.

1. Put 3 tablespoons (or more!) of uncooked dry rice into your frying pan over medium heat.
2. Once it starts to heat up
3. Continue to cook until rice turns a nice toasty brown. Approximately 10-15 minutes.
4. Remove from heat; allow rice to cool for 5-10 minutes
5. Place rice in coffee grinder/blender/mortar and pestel and grind/blend/smash until it's approximately the consistency of beach sand.
6. (Optional) If you can't quite get the rice fine enough

Once you're done the toasted rice powder should be [a nice golden brown color like this](http://taste-for-adventure.tablespoon.com/files/2011/01/2011-01-10-thailarbgai-larbgai05-500w.jpg) and smell quite roasty. Give it a taste! This is one of the primary (though subtle) flavors of Laab.


**Second: Rice**

1. Cook the rice. (This is important; you have no idea how many times I get to the end and smack myself in the head after forgetting this step).


**Finally: Laab**

*Prep:*

1. *Slice* the shallots into fine slices. Once sliced
2. Remove the mint leaves from the sprigs
3. Squeeze the juice from the 3 limes (I've heard microwaving limes for 5 seconds helps bring the juice out; also rolling them on the table. Use your best judgement

*Cook:*

1. Place the ground meat in the large pot and cook over medium heat. If it starts to stick to the bottom of the pan
2. Stir meat frequently as it cooks
3. Once meat is cooked all the way through (7-10 minutes) **remove from heat** but keep it in the pan.
4. Stir in chopped shallots and chopped mint (or Keffir lime leaf)
5. Add lime juice
6. Sprinkle about 2 tbsp toasted rice powder over the mixture
7. Add the Fish Sauce (be careful not to add too much; add about half
8. Finally
9. Serve over rice

**Tips:**

Yes, and I can guarantee that if you use the exact amounts above it *will* be magically delicious, but there are some adjustments you can make.

The flavor should be a combination of a few things: Tart, Fresh, and Spicy. Basically you're looking for the flavors of the meat, lime, toasted rice, shallot, and mint to shine through; all enhanced by the magic ingredient of Fish Sauce. Basically the fish sauce is the make or break here. 

The one mistake I always make is *too much fish sauce* as that generally makes things taste salty and a little off (""fishy"" if you will), with important salts and meaty goodness, sort of like bouillon does for soups. Experiment to add just the right amount, but 1 tablespoon is a conservative number that's a good start.

Also it's important to note the brand of fish sauce: Tipparos is my personal favorite and the only one that tastes familiar to me for Laab; but there are lots to choose from. [Here's a list of the only brands you should really look for](http://importfood.com/sati7501.html); don't bother with American ""thai cooking"" brands.

Lime juice and Shallots are the other two variables: generally with Lime juice

With shallots, but if you really don't have them, you could try red onions or other onions. But you have been warned.

**How to eat:**

Generally I just throw this over rice in about a 1:1 proportion and chow it down, you could dish the Laab and rice into a lettuce leaf and wrap it up and eat it that way, but generally I'm too busy enjoying it to care how the Laab gets to my mouth. Lettuce is a fresh afterthought.

1340006580.0,v7svd,The best beef you will ever taste.,joepoes,1,0,2,"I ate a braised beef dish at a South China style resaurant on Friday and got inspired to try and recreate it

Ingredients:

1.2kg of stewing beef

½ cup of light soya sauce

½ cup of dark soya sauce

1 cup of water

2 tbs of rice wine

a few slices of ginger – medium thickness

2 cloves of garlic – roughly chopped

a large pinch of five spice

a pinch of Sichuan black pepper

2 star anise pods – best if put in a bouquet garni pouch for easy removal

a pinch of red chilli

Method:


Cut the beef into large chunks


Boil the meat in water for a few minutes until it starts changing colour and the water becomes foamy


Place all the ingredients in a slow cooker or large pot and cook on very low temperature. Avoid the temptation to add more liquid


Serve with Jasmine rice and chopped spring onions.
