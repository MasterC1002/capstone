## #5

**[Solarstone &amp; Clare Stagg - The Spell (Solarstone's Pure Mix)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bAo69SJwFk)**

With its first big radio play on the ASOT 550 London Mix, 2012, here's what the record label has to say:

&gt;""'The Spell' is the first track out of the box from DJ/producer/legend Solarstone's forthcoming 2012 studio album. Featuring the folk-tinged vocal delivery of current Solar muse Clare Stagg, bleep-fuelled entrancing lead line and speaker-challenging drums, 'The Spell' is 100% uncorrupted, Pure Trance. So say it with pride.""

## #4

**[Armin van Buuren featuring Ana Criado - I'll Listen (Original Mix)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hH9ObJQAqc)**

Many were a bit shocked after hearing Armin's first collaboration with Ana Criado this year, followed by his Euro-anthem ""We Are Here To Make Some Noise,"" many thought Armin was finally abandoning fans of his older style of music: pursing ""Mirage"" sounds over ""Imagine"" sounds.  ""Suddenly Summer"" changed that, becoming an instant best-seller on Beatport.  So Armin went back to the studio with Ana Criado and produced a follow up: ""I'll Listen.""  The results of sales and our r/trance survey don't lie: ""I'll Listen"" completely surpassed ""Suddenly Summer"" on many levels and was played non-stop on radio shows everywhere.  Released on the famous Armind label of the Armada Empire on September 10th, 2012, here's what the record label had to say about the release:

&gt;""When the world needs a new anthem to adore, featuring Ana Criado.  Trending topics, top selling on Beatport and still a highlight to each of Armin's massive gigs. 'Suddenly Summer' is a tune that many a trance fan has locked inside their hearts, but we're pretty sure there's room left for its successor.  'I'll Listen' lights the listener's soul with warm melody, deep and proggy bass and spellbinding vocals by one of EDM's favorite singers. Another taste of midsummer's warmth, be prepared to meet it on the dance floor.

## #3

**[Omnia &amp; IRA - The Fusion (Original Mix)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGXv2J14glY)**

What do you get when you combine a superb and rising trance producer with a ridiculously catchy melody and heavily altered vocals?  You get this: ""The Fusion.""  Featured on two compilations this year, 2012, here's what the record label had to say:

&gt;Featuring on both Markus Schulz's Los Angeles '12 and Armin van Buuren's A State of Trance 2012 compilations is quite an achievement. But for talented Ukranian Omnia, projects Smart Apes member DJ Ira to the forefront. They combine to present ""The Fusion"".  
Omnia is no stranger to Coldharbour followers, such as ""My Inner Island"", and the beautiful ""Closer"" which featured the wonderful vocals of Susana. Ira's work as Smart Apes has also struck a chord with Global DJ Broadcast, notably with their track ""Perfect"".
Since the turn of the year, from the release parties at Avalon in Los Angles and the Global DJ Broadcast World Tour from the Guvernment in Toronto, to the opening night of the A State of Trance 550 celebrations in London and a proud moment for Omnia himself playing in front of his fellow country members in Kiev.
As well as the original, The Fusion looks set to explode further. 

## #2 

**[Andrew Rayel featuring Jano - How Do I Know (Original Mix)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wf14yrb7WqM)**

Andrew Rayel is no stranger to top tunes in 2012. From ""Aeons of Revenge"" to ""550 Senta, this was released on Armind (Armada) October 29th, 2012.  Here's what Armada had to say:

&gt;""Success comes at a fast pace for Moldavian producer Andrew Rayel. His tracks and remix are on fire
Bursting onto the scene in 2010, '550 Senta' and 'Source Code', as well as remixes for W&amp;W, Roger Shah and many others, he's grown into one of the most promising names in trance.
That status will once more be confirmed, better known as Jano, it is set to become the crowd's favourite for many magical moments to come.

## #1

10 million YouTube views.  Remixes by John O'Callaghan that perhaps arguably surpassed the original.  A track following in the footsteps of the catchy ""Tokyo.""  A superb vocalist.  A track some claimed was a hark back to the ""old days"" of trance.  All at the hands of a superb DJ and Producer.  You know what the song is by now.  This is it

---

I don't necessarily mean Armin Van Buuren (that might be unlikely, but if we could get Ernesto Vs Bastian for example to come on and do an IAmA right here on /r/trance, perhaps?

I'd like to know how many of you have something you'd want to ask them (or any other big artist).  Go ahead and post your thoughts!

**PLEASE NOTE:** I'm **not making any promises!**  Don't get your hopes up!  If there's enough support for this

**Edit:** Wow, and looks like you guys are gonna have some good quality questions.  I will do my best, guys.  Let's see how it goes!

**Edit 2:** Okay, rather than x-posting it to there, as the mods who run it might not like us submitting an x-post there.  Instead, I may x-post it from there to here, and simply leave an informative comment on the original post thread letting people know that /r/trance exists and is fairly cool if they're into trance.  That should prevent any potential issues with that.  I think.  I will message one of the mods of IAmA and ask about this anyway :)",,False,t5_2qi03,True

A few pointers (to be edited):

* Nominate as many tracks as you feel are your favorites from the year and people will vote if they agree. I'll start with my favorites.

* I'd say anything that has been released via traditional trance channels (trance-oriented- labels, regardless if they are somewhat genre-benders, however in the end upvotes will decide. Example: BT/Adam K - Tomahawk, Gareth Emery - Tokyo, etc

* Make sure the track was actually released this year and not last year or earlier by searching for the track on [beatport](http://www.beatport.com/) and sorting by ascending date.",self,t5_2qi03,True,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/trance/comments/n1eyp/top_trance_tracks_of_2011_as_voted_by_rtrance/

First of all I want to welcome our new members for joining one of the largest trance communities on the internet

To our current members thank you all for contributing and advocating trance music and r/trance to the rest of the world.

I appreciate it

We're growing at numbers that I had never seen before

[Here is a graph of our traffic for your enjoyment](http://i.imgur.com/DL98J.png)

**What have we been doing:**  

Some things I would like others in this subreddit to continue respecting each other, at first we would be deleting these posts then we decided to keep them and see if the users would educate each other on the matter. 

Not sure if that approach has worked that well but as any other subreddit that has grown above 5k it has its drawbacks. 

The number one thing for us moderators to do is to moderate and not to police, but with your help we can decrease it and keep r/trance as relevant as possible.

**So what we're asking is please do these:**  

Read the side bar

If you're posting songs

Tag NSFW material.

Also we are all friendly towards one another here so please no harsh words or criticisms of ones taste in a track or an artist. Please don't downvote a post just because you don't like others musical taste.

We want to encourage discussions about genre of trance in general [psytrance, mass downvoting has become a common problem recently so please don't downvote on the basis of not liking the artist or if you have already heard that track.

It has come to my attention that you may or may not be FINALLY into the best possible music genre ever invented, I am here to tell you that you are dead wrong. Trance is like mining for gold or diamonds, there is going to be shit flying everywhere. It is my duty to guide you through this perilous journey in hopes that you might truly come to respect the music as I do.

First, I recommend you substitute in ""Avicii""*) in all aspects, don't try it.

First step, eat your heart out.

**Second step: CLASSIC ALBUMS-**

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imagine_(Armin_van_Buuren_album)

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tri-State_(album)

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunny_Tales

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sirens_of_the_Sea_(album)

http://www.allmusic.com/album/universal-religion-2008-mw0000751314

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Addicted_to_Music


These are just some of the flipping CLASSIC albums that are out there. My number ones are probably Europop and Imagine.  These showcase the raw trance musical form, you are more than likely not high enough and clearly not thinking straight.

**Third Step: CLASSIC JAMS-**

Anhken - Green Line (Original Mix)

Above &amp; Beyond - Good For Me

Aly &amp; Fila - Listening (Philippe El Sisi Remix)

Mike Shiver feat. Aruna - Everywhere You Are (Duderstadt Remix)

Dash Berlin - Never Cry Again (Jorn Van Deynhoven Remix)

Dash Berlin - Till The Sky Falls Down

First State - Cross The Line (Extended Remix)

Flanders - Behind (EDX Remix)

Fragma - Toca's Miracle

Gabriel and Dresden - Tracking Treasure Down

George Acosta feat. Fisher - Tearing Me Apart (DNS Project Remix)

Giuseppe Ottaviani - Angel (Club Mix)

John 'O Callaghan - Big Sky (Agnelli &amp; Nelson Remix)

Lange - Live Forever (Mat Zo Remix)

Marcus Schossow &amp; Reeves feat. Emma Hewitt - Light (Mike Shivers Garden State Remix)

Matt Darey pres. Urban Astronauts - See The Sun (Aurosonic Remix)

Nitrous Oxide feat. Aneym - Far Away (Club Mix)

Sunlounger feat. Zara - Lost (Club Mix)

Super 8 &amp; Tab - Black Is The New Yellow

Vast Vision feat. Fisher - Everything (Aly &amp; Fila Remix)

Yuri Kane - Right Back (Original Mix)

4 Strings feat. Ellie Lawson - Safe From Harm

Mat Zo - The Fractal Universe (Original Mix)


**Fourth Step: CLASSIC CATEGORIES-**

Ok
Here is a quick list

Vocal Trance

Uplifting Trance

Hard Trance

Trouse (Trance-House)

Progressive Trance

Euro-Trance

Tech-Trance

Goa Trance

Psychedelic Trance

Acid Trance


Now the easiest way for me to explain genres is by pairing an artist with them who has that sound.

Aly &amp; Fila - Always have a harder and faster sound to them. Big bassdrums and loud melodies. Trade-mark sound is the sub drop (beeewwwwwwmmmmmm)

Armin Van Buuren - Progressive and vocal trance. Armin is a staple of the genre

Dash Berlin - Uplifting style. Crazy pads and pianos to make you feel like you are in heaven

John 'O Callaghan - Vocal trance! This is the man with the plan. Great vocals

First State - Hard trance sound with classic form



**Fifth Step: CLASSIC VOCALISTS-**

If at any time you see a song with any of the listed vocalists

Emma Hewitt

Aruna

Emma Lock

Aneym

Fisher

Zoe Johnston

Andain

Cristina Soto

Jaren

Zara Taylor

Sarah Howells

Audrey Gallagher

Susana

Ellie Lawson



**CONCLUSION**

The other day you were reading the Ultra lineup to me.....""like
Yes, or justify anything because it is simply fact. Trance is the best. Trance fans are widespread and very present, they listen to radio shows and attend concerts that nobody else usually are at or even think about.  In my opinion, the United States is still in its ignorant stages and everyone knows that because NO TRANCE ARTISTS EVER COME CLOSE.  They play Ultra and get the fuck out because nobody here listens to them.  It's quite unfortunate actually, that I will have to travel over seas to see the artists I love.....but it is a price I will have to pay. Now I set you off on your journey......I only hope I have given the tools and guidance necessary to make it a successful one. Good luck my friend........",,False,t5_2qi03,True

https://www.facebook.com/notes/max-graham/why-are-songs-titled-as-id/10151178583559075


&gt; If you see ID next to a track name it can be frustrating as you may want to purchase that track and support that artist. There are actually a few reasons why a DJ chooses not to reveal the name of a track. 
&gt; 
&gt;1. **Host is testing out their own material and ideas.** Sometimes i might play a track i've made that i'm not sure i'm even going to release. I may just want to see if there's any reaction on twitter. If there isn't much i may decide to completely scrap it and start over
&gt; 
&gt;2. **DJ is not supposed to have the record.** In some cases a track has been promised to another A-list DJ for a compilation exclusively, this keeps his radio audience happy with fresh new tunes and the DJ making the compilation still uses it for his tracklist. Win/Win.
&gt; 
&gt;3. **Track is not signed.** If i get a track that i'm trying to sign i of course want to beat other labels to signing it
&gt; 
&gt;4. **Artist has a song out at the same time.** A lot of artists/labels don't want people to feel like the song they are buying is not the latest one. If i play a record by an artists and tracklist it
&gt; 
&gt;5. **Spare the producer being put on the spot.** if i hear something by for example Myon and Shane54 on ASOT that i've never heard you can bet i'm emailing them right away. If it's listed as ID then i'm not
&gt; 
&gt;6. **Building Hype.** Sometimes the artist/label want to build some hype by getting people talking about a track without knowing who made it. The anticipation and speculation can help hype up a song before it's released. 
&gt; 
&gt;With google alerts being so on point it's impossible to hide anything once you type it on the internet. 
&gt; 
&gt;If it's out or available i will absolutely post it everywhere i can. As i've shown by being one of the only shows to provide easy access to tracks i play. By taking the extra time to search/cut/paste buy links into my tracklist i'm clearly on the side of promoting the artists rather than keeping things to myself. I'm also trusted by the artist with songs i shouldn't have for whatever reason,,False,self,t5_2qi03,False,,True

So I get into these moments -especially when listening to something even a bit old- like there's so much trance out there but there's so little time

Like today

Like Solee - Impressed (tried to think of a random song as an example) small lesser-known producer and if I didn't remember then I wouldn't hear that sweet sweet smooth bass.  I only heard the song through a friend as we were driving in his car and very likely could have never heard it to begin with.

Which brings up another reason for me to feel this way.  Finding good songs

This makes listening to anything not new bittersweet because I know there's great sounds I'm missing out on on a ratio of to what I do listen to.  Just wondering if anyone feels the same

This whole time Armin is running the ASOT radio show but Markus's set was cut off. So what do they do? Armin and Markus begin a KILLER back-to-back live set in the little booth behind the ASOT stage.

They even downloaded Darude's Sandstorm to play :)

1367722888.0,1dpp8h,"Thoughts of Armin's New Album After Seeing Him at His Intense Album Tour Debut at the Palladium, Los Angeles, CA",BRENTON8907,106,54

Last night I attended Armin’s Intense album tour debut at the Palladium in Los Angeles

When I first heard the album, I bought tickets to the show because you would have to be insane to live in Los Angeles and not go!  I had high expectations because he is the number #1 DJ in the world and his previous shows have always been sets to remember.

Now in terms of the concert, but a lot of it I identified as songs that were on the Beatport Trance Top 20 throughout the last year.  Not saying that in a negative way or anything, I am just trying to say that I was able to identify what songs he was playing quite easily.  Regardless, I had a blast during his set.

But in terms of Armin, Tiesto, Gareth Emery, etc.), massives (EDC 3 years, Escape from Wonderland, Beyond Wonderland, etc.), Ferry Corsten, CA).  In terms of the set

* I would say 1 in every 4-5 songs had a specially crafted video.  Including many songs that would have a cinematic entrance which pumped the crowd up (e.g.

* Singers, Aruna, Lauren Evans, Lauren Jansen, and Cindy Alma, sang songs from the Intense album and some of their other hits.

* Personally I think his mash-ups are amazing.  It’s great that through his mash-ups he can use lyrics from his older classics and layer them onto a newly released track (one that only a subset of the crowd has heard)

Now back to my thoughts on the album after seeing this set.  It made sense.  A lot of these tracks felt cookie-cutter at first

* He opened with Intense and a video constructed just for the song (features two violinists playing against one another

* I definitely did not understand This Is What It Feels Like when I first saw the preview video months ago.  But after seeing it live (W&amp;W remix)

* When I first listened to the album and heard Sound of the Drums I was expecting more.  But once I heard it live, but I’m sure you get what I’m saying.

Might be rambling, the type of show is changing.  In my opinion, the longer trance sets of today still have a back-bone of trance music, but the DJs are now adding in a wider mix of music (including progressive house and trouse) and the best DJs make it more of a cinematic experience than just a pure-trance-music/dance inspired event.  It felt as if Armin wrote a movie for us to dance to, especially when you consider how he had numerous live singers and dozens of specially crafted videos.

If you have the chance to see him for his Intense album tour

Anyone else see Armin last night?  Did it affect your thoughts of the new album?

I already posted the partial tracklists below. I'll update my posts as soon as the rest of the sets are IDed

Also, so the fans of uplifting will rejoice. 

I highly recommend the following sets from what I had the chance to hear and what others have recommended on the di.fm forums:

A State Of Blue

02. Gabriel &amp; Dresden 
03. Aly &amp; Fila
04. John O'Callaghan

A State Of Green

01. Orjan Nilsen
02. Markus Schulz
03. Armin van Buuren (classics)
04. Giuseppe Ottaviani

A State Of Yellow

01. Matt Darey
02. Protoculture
03. Jorn van Deynhoven
04. Ronski Speed

A State Of Pink

01. Sophie Sugar
02. Claudia Cazacu
03. Lisa Lashes

A State Of Red

01. Sebastian Brandt
02. DNS Project

Set of the night is a toss-up b/w Armin's classic set and Sebastian Brandt's set on the RED stage.

I didn't mention Armin's set from A State Of Blue simply because it was a mix of tunes he already played in his previous sets at ASOT 550 events combined with tunes from ASOT 554. The set itself is good/great

UPDATE:

I have updated the tracklists with all the sets that have been IDed so far. I finally managed to get all the sets downloaded so I'll start to listen to them and ID what I can.

Many of you who listen to trance radio shows will be familiar with the whole 'track/record/tune of the week' concept so I thought it would be cool if r/trance could vote on a track of the week. We could do both pro tracks but also a side one for r/trance producers. This way we would be showing users the latest and best (in our opinion) trance tracks but also supporting any producers. 

I've always felt reddit should have a poll feature of some sort and I'm not to sure how any of what I have said would work but I think it would be cool. So feel free to suggest ideas for how this could work,False,self,t5_2qi03,False,,,t3_q1t9c

First off I want to introduce myself. My name is Elias and I live in Washington DC. Recently I have helped start a trance-only night at Lima Lounge. The best part of this is that it is co-sponsored by Euphonic Records and United States Trance Movement. For the month of January, we have Ronski Speed, Stoneface &amp; Terminal, Menno de Jong, Myon &amp; Shane 54, Mark Eteson and many more. I am reaching out to you guys today to see if anyone wants to help me out with promotions, etc. I can guarantee free entry to every show and you'll most definitely get to meet the talent. If you live in the DMV (DC, Virginia) please PM me for more information. If you just want to come to the shows and get free entry

You guys know that I am active in this subreddit

It was mentioned that a lot of people don't recognize the differences between trance and house music.  I hope to make it clearer with this post.  This is mostly for sub-genres that are more similar to trance.  Hopefully you wouldn't mistake psytrance for house or electro house for trance.

Both genres (this is part of what can lead to confusion):

* Usually a bass kick on each beat.

* Instruments are generally added or taken away every 4 or 8 bars.

* 120-150 BPM.  Trance tends to be faster.  Psytrance and hard trance sometimes push past 145 BPM.

Trance:

* Synthesizers are used heavily. There can be multiple layers of synth rhythms going on at once

* A ""synth lead"" is often used for the main hook of the song. Sometimes used in house (especially electro)

* [Arpeggios](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arpeggio) are common.

* Reverb and delay.  It's the echo effect you hear

* Buildups and breakdowns are important features of the song structure.  This is usually not true for most house songs.  This doesn't mean they are nonexistent

* Side chaining and gated synths.  Used quite often in trance and not so much in other genres.  These are used to ""cut out"" the volume on parts of a note or voice

* Trance focuses more on building a melody

Look for any of these characteristics if you are having troubles figuring out if it is trance.  Over time

Trance genre examples:

* [Progressive](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FD0UmSHltU)

* [Uplifting](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hIccvKscAc)

* [Goa](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KYnTykSgDwk)/[Psy](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qlRLzKDjX1I)/[Prog Psy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q79bvoNrGt8)

* [Hard](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-RrW50KD7M)

* [Tech](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dybBj8awBXM)

* [Acid](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPlX0R4O1b8)

* Vocal - you can figure it out

House genre examples (besides electro and progressive

* [Progressive](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqHFHuCkono)

* [Electro](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QXoXMjUGHMg)

* [This](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ovdm2yX4MA) is the clubby stuff that people get confused sometimes. It is more focused on the beat and not a melody.  Once you get the feel for both genres

**tl;dr** - The easiest way for me to explain it is trance has more of a ""flow"" to it.  Trance's structure focuses on buildups

**Note**:  I used words like ""usually"" and ""often"" throughout because these aren't always true.  Any producers out there or people who feel they know trance better,False,self,t5_2qi03,1366917574.0,,us,t3_p8h2m

So I came across some older ASOTs starting from 210 and now I'm up to 224 and *holy. fucking. shit* They're absolutely **AMAZING.** Like

They're like beautiful electronic symphonies, so energetic, and so euphoric. Epic build ups, perfect breaks, fantastic fast basslines, no cheesy vocals, just purely amazing.

I don't want to make a huge thing about it (being we just celebrated 24K subscribers what seems to be just last week)

First

That being said

###Refreshers:

1. First and foremost, trance music, and you!

2. Please make sure you read the rules on posting.  They're on the right sidebar in the very nifty black box.  This should hopefully answer most issues with why your post might be removed.  The largest issue we usually have is reposts (don't worry

3. Remember that this is a *Trance* subreddit.  I know sometimes Progressive House is hard to tell apart from Progressive Trance, Discogs, etc. as guides to help you determine where your song lies.  On that note, just a friendly reminder that artists explore: a trance artists can produce songs outside the trance realm, which can be great! But please try to find the appropriate subreddit for that song or link.

4. For new and older users, Trance Labels, Past AMAs, a nice list of podcasts, and more!

5. Keep up to date with our weekly podcast or upcoming AMAs by checking our Announcements on the top right of the page (if you keep our CSS enabled of course!).

6. Finally, regardless if you're a new user or been here 6+ years, to refresh yourselves on [Redditquette](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette).  While it hasn't been as bad as other subs I visit, I have noticed a few issues in the past few months, especially with the Spring Season of large shows and Album Releases.  Mainly, **upvote posts and comments that contribute to the community and discussion *regardless* if you agree with the comment or not**.  I know we have the tendency to hit the downvote button automatically if someone criticizes our #1 artist, but that person's opinion is just as valid as your's.  And without diverse interests in our community

Anyway

It was difficult as many of you said

The person that accumulated the most votes from /r/trance members in our first 2012 mix competition is [Eatofo](http://soundcloud.com/brian-eatough/put-your-hands-up-for-reddit)! 

Congratulations eatofo

As promised eatofo will be given his spot on the sidebar for his mix so that everyone can listen to it for one month.

If you guys have any suggestions on how to make upcoming mix competitions better please leave a comment bellow and if it's possible I will implement it into our next competition.

Every /r/trance mix competition feeds from your feedback and improves.

I hope everyone had fun and for those of you who missed out don't worry will have another one soon.

- [Full Discogs entry](http://www.discogs.com/artist/Fei-Fei)
- [Synchronicity](http://www.discogs.com/Fei-Fei-Synchronicity/release/1744379)
- She kicked off her own label

Some of her best tracks

- [Fei-Fei - Ender](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOLE2Vu6_ls) (2008) [Club Elite/Armada]
- [Fei-Fei - Everglow](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttplPrzKON0) (2008) [Vandit]
- [JOOP - Pradera (Fei-Fei Remix)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pe8MDUCYSY4) (2009) [High Contrast]
- [Fei-Fei - Daksa (Reaky Remix)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfayNdupBco) (2010) [Feided]

a) Fei-Fei is not a nobody who appeared out of nowhere.

b) Her image has always, Claudia Cazacu, etc). An oft-cited quote is ""Fei-Fei is the bad girl of trance""-- spoken by none other than **Tiesto** on his Club Life show (back when both he &amp; she were still in trance, hahahahaha oh man that's funny).

I'm not saying it excuses her being rude during her interview

c) Booking her was a clear strategic move on ASOT's part

Why do I say that? She was the first artist up that night. First. Artist. In. The Lineup. Artists at major festivals are very

I mean, I'm also pretty sure they were testing the waters to see if they could have a slice of the dubstep bandwagon pie. If it went badly, well, the masses would turn on her, not them. (which they did.)

---

Which brings me to my personal rant. I used to be a pretty big Fei-Fei fan, I got saaaaad. 

Why? There are very few women in trance. And of the women in trance

But I accepted it as her creative decision/personal choice. It didn't seem contrived. I just stopped listening to her podcasts/shows &amp; releases. A loss for trance

When ASOT550 announced its A State of Pink ladies' stage (which, put them on the same stage as the dudes), I was unsurprised to see Fei-Fei not on the lineup, but sad *again,* because I felt like it was a reaffirmation of her fall from grace, as it were. When I heard she was opening for ASOT550 LA, though

Yeah

The fallout has been rifuckingdiculous, laid-back, euphoric trance scene my ass! You don't hear people calling Shogun by racial slurs because he stays in his happy little trance niche. You also don't hear people objectifying trance artists much-- wait, except for...listen to anyone talk about a vocalist (or Claudia Cazacu) and the convo inevitably turns to ""also, she's hot"" or ""but she's not hot :((((("" la di fucking daaaaah.

u mad, I still get mad when I hear Ferry Corsten &amp; Markus Schulz doing mindblowingly terrible house tracks. I got mad when the likes of Gabriel &amp; Dresden and Gareth Emery and Armin started playing sets completely under 132 BPM-- 

but I didn't start slinging personal attacks left &amp; right. ('cept Tijs looks weird

1373395393.0,1hy9l1,Featured Artist: Dash Berlin [OC],Le7els,70,14,35,"Last week I posted a link to a blog post I made featuring Dash Berlin. It was almost immediately downvoted out of sight for what another redditor claimed as potentially blog spam. The main reason I wrote the post was because people seemed to enjoy my previous one about Myon &amp; Shane 54. I spoke with a very nice mod who explained that my link was in fact not blog spam and who said it contributed a unique conversation to the sub. I understand that a lot of people no longer like Dash Berlin and that his sound is much more electro these days


**TL;DR: My blog got downvoted so here is a self post because I want to share good music and good vibes.**


I received a lot of Internet love for my post about [Myon &amp; Shane 54](http://edmozer.wordpress.com/2013/07/02/featured-artist-myon-shane-54/) yesterday

It’s hard to even begin writing about Dash Berlin because of his huge impact on my taste in music, but I am still unclear about whether they all still make music or if it is just one guy. Maybe someone can comment below and fill me in.

Anyway, this is the PERFECT Trance song. It pretty much set the tone for my interest in Trance and I have been hooked ever since. [“Man On The Run”](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOq7RcjXtiA) is in contention for my favorite Trance song, which will eventually be decided in the post I have been waiting to write since I began blogging – my top 10 Trance songs of all-time. Also, you HAVE to listen to the nine minute version. You have to.

The thing that makes Dash the shit is that his music goes so hard at times, raw sound that I’ve never heard anyone replicate. Take for example any of his 4AM remixes. He takes incredibly beautiful songs in their own right and recreates them with his own darker spin. My favorite example of this is [“Not Giving Up On Love (Dash Berlin 4AM Remix).”](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVySkpsADwI) Now I’m not the biggest Armin fan, but you can tell that the original was seriously missing something. So what does Dash do? He comes in and crushes it!

Another thing that I want to add to this conversation is my progression of Dash Berlin listening. After I fell in love with “Man On The Run,”](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQzq5vQhA_U) however I became strangely attracted to the lesser-known [“Never Cry Again”](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRCVTnp1x3Y) and [“The Night Time.”](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYj_8_EEHJk) Anyone who went to college with me might remember me banging my head away at College Library while you were slaving away studying. If you do, there’s a good chance it was to one of those two songs because I was obsessed!

I’ve been fortunate enough to see Dash Berlin live twice. Once at EDC Vegas 2011 and then a few weeks ago at EDC again. The guy is a really goofy showman who brings out an iPad and types stuff like “Music is Life” or other cliché stuff. But I buy into his shtick and so do most of his crowds because that is what Trance is about. #TranceFamily is no joke and there’s really nothing more enjoyable to me than belting out the lyrics to a Dash Berlin classic surrounded by his other diehard fans. As you can imagine

The following songs are roughly in order of which I like most. There are a lot of other good ones that I did not include in this post

1. [Dash Berlin, Cerf – Man On The Run](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOq7RcjXtiA) (135 BPM)

2. [Jaren

3. [Dash Berlin – Till The Sky Falls (Dash Berlin 4AM Mix)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygPgWAhUAnI) (135 BPM)

4. [Ferry Corsten – Not Coming Down (Dash Berlin 4AM Remix)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdZnD7qkUzM) (130 BPM)

5. [Armin Van Buuren – Not Giving Up On Love (Dash Berlin 4AM Mix)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVySkpsADwI) (135 BPM)

6. [Dash Berlin – Never Cry Again](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRCVTnp1x3Y) (135 BPM)

7. [Dash Berlin – The Night Time](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYj_8_EEHJk) (128 BPM)

8. [Dash Berlin &amp; ATB – Apollo Road (Club Version)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpVlfz0Y8x8) (133 BPM)

###More on Sasha &amp; John Digweed    


Sasha &amp; John Digweed are a pair of DJs from the United Kingdom. John Digweed had been DJ-ing for ten years before getting a gig at Renaissance where he met Sasha, focusing on track selection and technical mixing abilities. In 1994, they released the triple CD mix album Renaissance: The Mix Collection on Renaissance Records. It contained many popular dance hits of the time from artist such as Leftfield, Fluke, and 2 Bad Mice as well as original productions and remixes from the duo themselves. Two years later, the duo became ""true superstars"" (AllMusic) with the release of their double CD Northern Exposure on mega-label Ministry of Sound.

""There's a reason why the current crop of EDM superstars hide behind gimmicky masks and haircuts

I generally hate being cliche, my friends and I were really unsure of what we were getting ourselves into. For one, I was the only one with a history of listening to trance. Within a few hours, we were having a blast and dancing our faces off. Not a single heart was held up towards the DJ booth, and not more than a few seconds at a time glancing towards him. We spent the entire show dancing with or at each other and those around us. Considering how awkward and introverted I was (well, still am), plus the fact that my friends listened to rock and hip-hop, the right people

That used to be the exact sentiments I'd later have going out to night clubs to see my favorite DJs. As time went on, Max Graham at Pachita, Eric Prydz at Roseland Ballroom... I'll probably remember a few and edit this later. Anyhow, as more people threw hearts at the DJs and spouted hash tags claiming their allegiance to their genre/style, the quality of a night out drastically decreased. 

All I can really conclude from this is that the surge in popularity has directly impacted the quality of experience at electronic music events. There was a time when everyone was there for one reason, Deadmau5 coming to mind (rant within a rant, rantception: back in my day, the only people with helmets were Daft Punk!....).

I've become less and less impressed with the music I'd hear when attending the shows of even some of my favorite producers and DJs. As a DJ myself, when he's given 6+ hours he's always an awesome performance to check out). It's still somewhat disappointing that I'm rarely intrigued by most live sets.


I have to say New York City is pretty spoiled when it comes to its resident DJs who know how to throw down: Zack Roth and Brad Miller for example always play musically awesome sets at any given time and of course the east coast trance all stars such as Eco




Before I go into Mr. Graham's set, and the sound system is exponentially weaker than Pacha's main room. This, as you can imagine, drastically impacts a DJs performance as even the heaviest of tracks pushed to their limits can sound toned down or weak. 




When Max took over the decks, the dance floor didn't clear with his first track which had just the right amount of techno influence. What I always hope for in a night out happened in a matter of minutes: DJ worship ended and appreciation of the musical journey began.




From that point on, he wasn't posing or holding his hands up acting as the clubs puppet master. It wasn't a show based on stage presence, like I've come to expect. He let his set do the talking, and paid close attention to his crowd. 




From driving, not once did I feel this set was forced. It was entirely appropriate for the venue, very much represented his work and sound as a trance producer and head of a record label, and still kept adjusting to the crowd to keep us moving. His tracklist was clearly not predetermined, or he knew in advance just how to play to his listeners. 




Whatever the case may be

edit:

TL;DR:
- Lots of DJs play the same set across the globe and/or fill their track list with choon after choon

I record my vocals on a professional microphone in which i own. This makes it easy for us to record/re-record tracks until we get them right very easily. I have a decent portfolio of accapella tracks I would be willing to send you.

Remember the days of old raves, but that doesn't change the fact that there's a lot of awesome classic trance out there. Sadly, tho, there isn't much love to be found for classic trance here. I blame the fact that it isn't exactly played on radios, since it's over 20 years old and didn't have a huge hold of the market to begin with.

So

Maybe this will encourage some older trance being posted here

The list below includes top upvoted tracks of all time that were posted more than once and are now being considered for auto removal and will be archived in our wiki.

To give credit the list was compiled by thespecial1.

The reasoning behind this list is to reduce re-posts that constantly get high upvotes and also to bring out newer content that will keep /r/trance great to come back to. 

If you have any tracks that you'd like to be considered in this list

Cheers

Now, even better, take the initiative and make first contact like subgrafix!  Show them how successful the Airbase one was, and apologise for the interface of reddit (it was designed by programmers... go figure).

###Some select comments on questions.

**What do you like about r/trance?**

* Community
* As a returner to the trance world
* Very minimal circle-jerking
* Diverse fanbase
* The emotion. How a simple melody spanning a few bars, party, sleep, or fly, or all of those emotions in one track. Every song is a different journey and I can listen to it all day. 
* Everything

**What do you dislike about r/trance?**

* Pointless posts
* Elitism in comment sections. Some people seem to think older trance is infinitely superior to any new releases.
* Circlejerk
* I despise all the negativity about current trance. There are some legitimate complaints, some of it new, some of it a good mix of both. I'd rather see people sharing and talking about those then bitching about what they miss.. maybe they need a r/classictrance
* Not enough news about the scene and low amount of open discussion threads
* That there seems to be some kind of barrier of knowledge between ""old"" trance fans and newer ones, and even go so far as to shun certain artists that I personally love, Dash Berlin for example (though I do think their declining ASOT 600 was a pretty dick move). It's just that I can't exactly see why.
* Everyone argues like a Canadian
* I don't laugh a lot :( there aren't too many jokes.
* The comments sometimes come off as snobbish.  It's fine to dislike other things
* People posting ""obvious"" tracks.
* It seems like most people don't vote on a track unless it's by a popular artist/producers...the most upvoted submissions are something trivial and mostly irrelevant to the main point of the sub-reddit.

**Thoughts on our moderators**

* Cool dudes
* I haven't seen any mod posts or anything
* Fun competitions
* They appear to be on top of their shit. Thank you r/trance mods.
* Mods are a little too quick to remove songs they don't feel are trance

**Suggestions to better the Trancit Weekly Podcast**

* Need intro/outro/ID during.  Possibly even a host.
* Yes
* Rated in the middle because I don't listen to it.
* Definitely needs 'jingles': an intro/outro and somewhat frequent mentions that this is an r/trance podcast. I wouldn't want anyone's mixes stolen from a scummy

**Suggestions and Comments for the Album of the Week**

* Paul Oakenfold - Bunkka
* I think one Album per week is too much. I'd prefer Album of the month!
* I don't really care about the AotW
* I like it. You should make an AOTW playlist on Spotify that is nothing but these Albums. Also
* I feel like the albums of the week aren't mainstream enough
* Perhaps more compilation albums (ISOS / Markus Schulz's compilations / Will Holland's digitally enhanced). Most albums of the week seem to be single artist albums

**Changes you would like to see?**

* List of common searches (best non-vocal
* I think it would be a good idea to force mixes (be it home made or live rips) to self-post only. No more pretty thumbnail luring
* More moderators that are active and come up with nice things like contests and AMA's.
* Maybe consider blacklisting certain artists like other music subreddits have done.
* Pull up the name of the countries flag when you mouseover it - like what /r/bicycling does.

**Any other thoughts?**

* Keep doing what you're doing!
* Please make it more visible for people to visit TranceCirclejerk if they want to rage on another genre or on Avicii - Levels 
* Sassanix is a beast.
* NEEDS MORE FSOE
* Great job guys.
* It would be cool if there were a tagging system for the song posts so I knew ahead of time what kinda tracks they were (and thus, when linking to youtube, take advantage of the ""&amp;t="" feature to direct-link to the song's drop (or like 15-30 seconds before it) so I don't click on a link and waste 3 min with endless thumping.  This is mainly because if I'm clicking on a song submission link in r/trance it's to hear NEW songs, not songs I know, so I just want to know whether I like it

Survey Link Here:

[Google Docs Survey](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/viewform?formkey=dGd1b0JWNUltZXBKekVVYnBxdVhMcUE6MQ)

--------------------------------------------------------

*So how does this work?*

* Glad you asked.  Instead of posting a comment and counting up votes like years past, many inputs.  

* You are still welcome to post your favorite songs here in this thread

*What are the rules?*

* The only thing that is required is your top 5 tracks of 2012 (in similar style to ASOT's TOTY voting)

* For consistency when counting votes

* For example

*What constitutes 2012?*

* The track must have been released somehow between December 1st

*How are you counting the tracks?*

* 5 points will go to the top track, I will highlight the most popular remix based on frequency occurrence.  

*What's with the rest of the survey?*

* The rest of the survey is completely optional and will have no bearing on your Top 5 Tracks.  I do encourage you to fill it out, artists, and shows of 2012.  I also have a section dedicated to misc. questions (such as best music video), online trance purchases, and a final page on your thoughts about this subreddit.  On behalf of the moderating team, I especially encourage you to fill out this last page.  I personally will be reading every response and sharing the results with the other moderators of this subreddit.

* In short


----------------------------------------------------------------

Okay

* Submit your responses by **December 15th

* From there

* **Rules:**

* The theme is ""Best of 2012."" 

* Take any of the Top 50 tunes from the list posted on /r/trance (the list that I'll post on or around December 16th).  Only requirement: *you must include the top tune somewhere in your mix.*  (Edit: Subject to Change)

* Make a mix any way you want however you want. 

* It should be 1 hour in length

* Send me a link by **December 23rd, Archive, etc.

* On December 24th

* On December 31st at 11:59:59PM

* Winner gets front page recognition *and* will have his or her winning mix as the featured mix on our weekly podcast, 2013.  


----------------------------------------------------------------

Sorry for the long post.

**TL;DR**: Go vote for your Top Tracks [by taking this Google Docs survey here.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/viewform?formkey=dGd1b0JWNUltZXBKekVVYnBxdVhMcUE6MQ)  Fill out the rest (optional but highly recommended). Hit submit.  Do it before the end of December 15th.  I post results. You mix it. We all vote.  Winner takes all.

Ask if you have any questions.  Comment your thoughts or songs if you'd like.

Cheers

Better Half of Me (Alex M.O.R.P.H remix) made a massive impression on me and was the song that got me hooked to the scene. I listened to that episode on repeat for probably the next 5 weeks till i figured out I could download more of the latest episodes.


Other honorable mentions in episode 537 are:


Andrew Rayel - 550 Senta (Aether Mix) 

Protoculture - Topaz

Orjan Nilsen - Lucky Strike


Listening back to this episode now I see so many hidden gems that makes me wish that Trance music didn't progress so quickly just so I could hear a few of these songs again!


Binary Finary &amp; Daniel Wanrooy - Isle of Lies (Adam Szabo Remix)

Luke Bond Feat. Emel - Amaze 


Those are two of the songs from that episode which are so good but just don't see any play.

We DO exist. I dunno where you all are supposedly looking

Also, and attends on average about 2 trance concerts a month, I feel my level of appreciation for trance may be a huge nerdy turn off to the men I tend to meet. :/ For instance, I know only know one guy (who I fall for every time we talk trance), but at the same time we'll argue over it as well.
ex:

me: ""oh wow. this new tritonal remixes album is totally bangin'.""

him: ""I miss old trance."" 

me: ""shut up. the classics will always be there for us to appreciate and share with each other

But just like you males, Markus Schulz, Aly &amp; Fila and M&amp;S54 and its not like it gets all that noticed. 
Trance is sometimes just too small of a sub-culture to find others like us in our everyday lives. 
So for those of you who have someone special to share that with

1342124784.0,wgljq,So I have this theory...,k4osth3ory,47,10,40,"the reason people find trance repetitive is that they are not really listening to the song. For most songs, the instrument that the audience is supposed to pay attention to is the loudest or at least close to the loudest. This is why it is easier for people to enjoy these other genres; they don't have to really listen. 

This is just my speculation. Feel free to disagree. 

Second theory: The way that I know a mix album is truly spectacular is when I find myself constantly listening for the introduction and disappearance of different instruments. I like to challenge myself when listening to them to see if I can hear all the different subtleties. In addition, or catch it very rarely. Those being the mix from Raincry to OBE, OBE to I'm Free (I have no idea where Playdo's Mix starts), and Liquid Cool to Last Train to Lhasa (from Northern Exposure).

The night was everything that I expected and more. Btw the crowd was so good and so much fun. Nobody created any drama and everyone gave each other enough space. It was all about the music and everyone really seemed to appreciate how special that night was.

All you have to do is just post tracks that promote a summer vibe and hopefully somebody with good mixing skills could make a couple hour long podcasts for all of [2] /r/trance to enjoy!

Edit: Thank you for contributing everybody! As of now we have 30+ songs that we can use to make a couple trance playlists. Here are four more tracks that i really enjoy:

I'm not a moderator or anything but I just wanted tell you guys that there have been quite a number of reposts around here lately. Normally I wouldn't have a problem with things as we should all be able to share music freely with each other and not everybody reads r/trance everyday and may have missed something. However

Obviously there's no real 'time limit' that you should use (i.e. It was posted a month ago so you shouldn't post it again)

If you want to check

I put a question mark in the title because I feel kind of a 'dick' about posting this because, you can post if you agree or disagree.

Any posts containing a submission will be voted on by users (downvotes will not be counted, we moderators reserve the right to reject even the most upvoted submission if we feel it's not appropriate (a trollface will not be our new logo, just sayin).

Your submission should be in PNG format, it's up to you!

Additional prizes may be included, but have yet to be decided on.

We are also looking for submissions for a new background image for the header.  Anything that is your own work, please also put it here for consideration.  You should clearly mark out that it's a header background submission, rather than a logo submission.

What we're proposing here

This could be a great way to spread the word of new talent

Guess what i'm really looking to do with this post is gauge interest. Who out there would be willing to participate? If there is enough interest I'll start working on a blogger site and a feed. Once we decide if its a go we can work out who will have admin abilities and such / iron out the fine details.

Hit me up here

!

EDIT: Looks like we have enough interest...Once I finish Dinner I'll start setting up the blog page and the rss feed....***big thing*** what do we call it? Saw down there someone mentioned an old one called ""A State of Trancit"" should we just continue that? or Go with something completely new? Thoughts?

EDIT:

Started setting it all up. I've got next to no graphic design skill but I tried to replicate what we have on the front page here as best as possible. I want to pick several very active users to help me out with this as admins and site designers. I have only the very basic of knowledge when it comes to this kinda stuff. Also In about five minutes I will start picking out of a hat to determine our first order of DJ's. I think that given the level of interest we will go with two mixes a week (two participants). I'm going to give eatofo the honor of starting first since he is the most recent mix contest winner. Unless anyone has any issues I'm looking to start this off next week with our first episode.

* Anyone can nominate any song. Any genre of trance is acceptable. Please post a link with your song though. Preferably youtube

* You can nominate as many songs as you like. 

* You can only nominate one song at a time.

* The list will be ranked according to upvotes only. ***NO DOWNVOTES PLEASE***
* 
So, upvote that track, if not, make a comment to add it. 






We can leave up this page for nominations for a while to give everyone a chance to vote and when everyone is satisfied we can close the nominations and then we will have the r/trance all time top 20.
