I put a lot of time and effort into this post
Also feel free to link this post to newcomers asking about mods

Before you get too far (or start a new game), many new NPCs, and other restored cut content and/or unfinished content. Watch the video for a demonstration of the mods.

However

-----------------------------------

**Installing and uninstalling mods easily**

* I'd recommend picking up [NMM - Nexus Mod Manager](http://newvegas.nexusmods.com/mods/modmanager/), and I believe NMM is the successor to FOMM. 


* Then, FO3 and FNV. Its a program that will sort your mod load order to reduce conflicts. You will also be notified if there are mod conflicts that need resolving (aka mod incompatiblities, mod patches needed, etc).

-----------------------------

**Onto the mods now

* [Project Nevada](http://newvegas.nexusmods.com/mods/40040) - A glorious mod with many features - you can sprint, and much, much more. It also has a bunch of customization options, to get the experience you want.

* [Dynamic Alternative Roleplayer's Start](http://newvegas.nexusmods.com/mods/45739) - allows you to not just create a character

* [Willow - A Better Companion Experience](http://newvegas.nexusmods.com/mods/41779) - adds a fully voiced and professio quality companion. She has her own questline

* [Electro-City](http://newvegas.nexusmods.com/mods/37908) - Mainly adds a ton of light-posts around the highways and roads in New Vegas - great mod. There is also an option to disable light-posts on highways if you so desire.

* [Vurt's Wasteland Flora Overhaul](http://newvegas.nexusmods.com/mods/39856) - Much, ESP-less ""replacer"" version

* [NMC's Texture Pack](http://newvegas.nexusmods.com/mods/43135) - The best HD texture overhaul for New Vegas

* [Weapon Retexture Project (WRP)](http://newvegas.nexusmods.com/mods/38285) - a WIP mod that retextures most weapons in Fallout New Vegas with a HD texture; most of FNV's guns had a lame low-res texture

* [Mission Mojave Ultimate Edition](http://newvegas.nexusmods.com/mods/45104) - Floating items, broken navmeshes, clipping meshes,  broken scripts, and many other fixes for a total of 20245 records in one download! This mod doesn't add anything new to the game, it simply fixes the issues that exist in the default game. Think of it like a ""Unofficial Fallout New Vegas Patch""

* [Fallout New Vegas Redesigned II](http://newvegas.nexusmods.com/mods/39218) - makes NPCs look better

* [Nevada Skies](http://newvegas.nexusmods.com/mods/35998) - Great weather mod that adds 60 new weather types

* [Monster Mod](http://newvegas.nexusmods.com/mods/41361) - Adds over a hundred new types of monsters to encounter in the game

* You should then download [Rebalanced Level Lists](http://newvegas.nexusmods.com/mods/44538) if you get Monster Mod

* [AWOP - A World of Pain](http://newvegas.nexusmods.com/mods/38719) - A very large mod that adds lots of new locations (sewers and such) and enemies. Consider installing this mod when you are a higher level.

* [Essential Visual Enhancements](http://newvegas.nexusmods.com/mods/42666) - This mod overhauls old and implements many new ""visual"" features -including energy weapon effects, and even opening animations for containers like cash registers.

* [Interior Lighting Overhaul](http://newvegas.nexusmods.com/mods/35794) - Overhauls the lighting of all interior cells of (vanilla and all DLCs) to a more realistic and ""fitting"" value, caves and ruins"".

* [Fellout](http://newvegas.nexusmods.com/mods/34888) removes the orange tint from vanilla FNV

* [More Perks](http://newvegas.nexusmods.com/mods/35979) - Absolutely love this mod. Adds like 100+ cool new perks to the game. Get this mod with [Perk Every Level](http://newvegas.nexusmods.com/mods/34707) - which lets you get 1 perk every level rather than 1 perk every two levels

* [Populated Casinos](http://newvegas.nexusmods.com/mods/35369) - Many new NPCs are added to the casinos of FNV

* [Dynavision](http://newvegas.nexusmods.com/mods/40077) - Adds DoF - very customizable

* [Immersive HUD (iHUD)](http://newvegas.nexusmods.com/mods/40340) Hides the HuD when you don't need it

* [CONELRAD 640-1240 - Civil Defense Radio](http://newvegas.nexusmods.com/mods/35061) - awesome new radio station! Uses real sounds from the 50s/60s 

* [Old World Radio](http://newvegas.nexusmods.com/mods/47577) - adds 9! new radio stations (and more with future updates!)

* [Shiloh DS - Coloured Map and Icons](http://newvegas.nexusmods.com/mods/35619) - this mod adds a colored world map and custom map icons (for stuff like skillbooks

* [NVInteriors Wasteland Project](http://newvegas.nexusmods.com/mods/43534) and [NVInteriors Urban Project] - these two mods aim to let you be able to explore houses that are boarded up or that you can't get into


**Utility Mods for Better Performance**
----------------------------------------------------------------------------


* [New Vegas Stutter Remover](http://newvegas.nexusmods.com/mods/34832) - Removes the stuttering that happens every 2-3 minutes (for me at least). Also includes an FPS limiter option that you can turn on or off. Can't play FNV without this mod =) This mod requires [New Vegas Script Extender](http://nvse.silverlock.org/)

* [Fake Fallout Fullscreen](http://newvegas.nexusmods.com/mods/41381) - a mod which *may* reduce crashes and increase performance

* [4GB Fallout New Vegas](http://newvegas.nexusmods.com/mods/35262) - Makes FNV silky smooth and this mod is required for HD texture or mods that add more NPCs. Make sure you get the version that works with NVSE


**Player Homes**
-----------------------------------

* [Underwater Hideout](http://newvegas.nexusmods.com/mods/36121) - A cool and unique underwater home.

* [Rancho Villa](http://newvegas.nexusmods.com/mods/46004) - If you are looking for a ranch-styled home.

* [Underground Hideout](http://newvegas.nexusmods.com/mods/37884) - ""This Mod adds a Player Vault on the the Wasteland near Spring Mt. Ranch State Park. The vault includes all the amenities including a Armory, water purifier, book shelf, grow area, and is Companion Friendly""


**Quest and New Location Mods**
-------------------------------------------------

* [New Vegas Bounties I](http://newvegas.nexusmods.com/mods/37310) - basically accept contracts to kill bad guys

* [New Vegas Bounties II](http://newvegas.nexusmods.com/mods/41184) - the sequel to the first one

* [Badlands](http://newvegas.nexusmods.com/mods/44408) - A sweet and simple quest taking place in a new location

* [Beyond Boulder Dome](http://newvegas.nexusmods.com/mods/46907) - as of this post, and its a large quest mod taking place in Boulder, Colorado where the main quest has different endings depending on your choices and there are several small side quests too. Amazing quest mod.

* [DEIMOS](http://newvegas.nexusmods.com/mods/43411) - a quality quest mod that involves you traveling back in time.

* [Fortune Canyon](http://newvegas.nexusmods.com/mods/43925) - adds a bunch of smaller quests focused on treasure hunting.

Some of them are things that were explained in FO3 but they don't bother to get into here, some it seems they just assume the player should know. Let's get a list of these going to help ease the frustration of fellow couriers who got shot in the face.

Please feel free to add your own tips in the comments and I'll add them to this list.

(PC only) As in most FPS games, as well as stimpacks and other chems. (Note that you can't bind anything to 2, because it's the default ""change ammo type"" key)

How to do it: in the weapons/apparel screen of your Pipboy, simply press the assigned number, and the item will be equipped without having to go to your Pipboy. Magic.

You can also hold down the number key outside of the Pipboy screen and it will give you the weapon icon map again.

(Xbox 360/PS3) You can bind weapons, go to your inventory, select the item you want to bind, hold down RB (360) or R2 (PS3) and tap the direction on the D-pad you want to assign that weapon to. (thanks [Ploppy17](http://www.reddit.com/r/fnv/comments/e3xyu/tips_little_tips_and_tricks_that_the_game_doesnt/c1544qp) and [ianscuffling](http://www.reddit.com/r/fnv/comments/e3xyu/tips_little_tips_and_tricks_that_the_game_doesnt/c15452r) for the console controls)

-----

- ### **You can drag objects around without putting them in your inventory**

On the PC target the item and press the Z key; on Xbox 360 and PS3

**For items and corpses:** If you want to loot a corpse or steal a skill book or magazine away from the watchful eyes of NPCs, you just won't get the reputation loss or have the item taken back from you).

This can be very useful in places like Silver Rush (Freeside)

You can use open doors as cover - so long as it displays [HIDDEN] when you're crouched

Even cheekier is this tip from [permanentmarker](http://www.reddit.com/r/fnv/comments/e2nv8/i_had_no_idea_you_could_do_this_until_my_friend/c14vke0): if you take a bucket or cooking pot into a place with a lot of ammo lying around (like Silver Rush), get out of sight, and then pick it up.

You can also move the offending person by pushing them (move straight into them and they'll be pushed backwards) out of the room

**For corpses:** Occasionally a corpse will be covering up an item underneath it (or sometimes even a live mine). Also

-----

- ### **Your Pipboy has a light**

I had played Fallout 3 for about 10 hours before I accidentally discovered this. No more messing with the brightness controls on your monitor/TV! There *is* a flashlight in Fallout

Remember to turn it off when sneaking/stealing.

-----

- ### **When hacking

This applies to FO3 as well

You know those junk characters between the words you see when hacking locked terminals? Well

`{£^@""&amp;amp;%}`

`[%£""$&amp;amp;@$]`

`&lt;^$£*$%!&gt;`

`(*$£""&amp;amp;""!@)`

When you hover over these, any valid brackets or parentheses count: (), [], {}, &lt;&gt;.

If you click the bracketed selection

The easy way to spot these is just hover over them - if it selects the whole string instead of individual junk characters

Sometimes you'll see extra brackets within a bracket trick - if there are several opening brackets

`{%{£^!£&amp;}`

In this case, leaving you with an extra bracket trick to use.

Worth noting that you may not get an available bracket trick every time you hack a terminal. Sometimes you'll get more than one. Luck of the draw.

It's worth mentioning here for new players that if you've made 3 attempts and still are not sure what the password is

-----

- ### **You can plant grenades

Old trick from Fallout 1/2. If you pickpocket someone (crouch and press the 'Use' key (E on PC) when near them) and place a grenade or mine into their inventory, because in a couple of seconds they're going to blow up. You'll also be credited 1 kill under the ""Pants exploded"" bit in your stats. :)

Do note that even though your victim won't see you putting the explosive in their pocket (and even if they did, and they will probably start attacking you once your victim explodes. If you're in a crowded room, better to keep your distance and go for a silent sneak attack critical. (thanks [drBlack884](http://www.reddit.com/r/fnv/comments/e3xyu/tips_little_tips_and_tricks_that_the_game_doesnt/c1540tm))

REMEMBER: the effectiveness of pickpocketing relies on the same things as sneaking. A high sneak skill obviously helps

-----

- ### **You can ['reverse pickpocket'](http://fallout.wikia.com/wiki/Planting_items) people to steal their equipped items**

If you're trying to pickpocket something that an NPC has equipped (for example a unique gun or armour)

Basically, and then the item they had equipped before will appear in their inventory on the pickpocket screen.

For weapons, the DR has to be higher than their current equipped armour.

Once you've planted the better item in their inventory

- Leave the area and come back a while later (use the wait command or sleep).

- Leave the area, go back to the area.

If the item you've planted is better

Related tip: if you want to steal somebody's hat or headgear but don't have a better hat to put in their inventory

Be aware that reverse pickpocketing will still result in karma loss

You guys pretty much said to stick with it

Some specific things:

 - No subway system.  Travelling above ground is such a relief.  I remember getting completely lost and frustrating trying to navigate through the endless tunnels of FO3.

 - Replayability. I love when I complete a quest on the strip and suddenly get a notification that I just failed 3 other quests.  It means that I can get a totally new experience playing through again.

 - Enemy diversity - In FO3

 - Decent writing - This might be the biggest factor. In FO3, but in NV, I exhaust every single character's dialogue choices just because they actually have interesting things to say.

For those of you who haven't done this quest the plants you gather are drugs, looking for an exit, and when I finally find it I encounter [Joshua Graham](/spoiler) and have a conversation with him essentially about the other DLC's.

Now I'll come back to that
    This yao guai is an oversized variant with a flaming body. It has a phenomenal attack power which can kill a heavily armored person in just a few blows
 And along with that

So, thinking about my conversation with [Graham](/spoiler) . And this gets me thinking about the themes of all the DLC. Love, lust, Revenge, Nostalgia, Greed. And I realized why the DLC, why Fallout New Vegas, putting you into the actions and consequences of following those base emotions. Regardless of they're flaws these DLC's

I keep waiting but it does not seem to be going away so I decide to go back into town and go indoors. After taking a couple of steps *Danger* starts to flash. I turn around once again thinking scorpion....nope....Deathclaw. 

So I start running back to town. I am level 1 with only shit weapons and this thing is attacking. After hitting me a couple of times I finally duck into the bar with little health thinking I am safe(er). As I get inside Sunny Smiles and company go to protect me against the deathclaw. So while they are doing that I hide in the bathroom.I hear one by one die and the deathclaw still breathing. So now its like a scene out of jurassic park. I am hiding in the bathroom and can only hear the deathclaw breathing....and then walking....toward me. Slowly he walks up to the door

Your ship has dropped you off in this human wasteland to eliminate your target. He killed your brother and you had to take his place and kill the one named Benny. Sneak around this wastelands inhadbitants and kill them when they least expect it. After you kill the man who murdered your brother

This play through will limit you to using Energy weapons and unarmed. You are very intellegnt and perceptive

**Alien Character**

You and your crew were flying over the Mojave when suddenly your ship took fire from a camp across from what the humans call ""Hoover Dam"" and crash landed on the out skirts of the region. You wake up inside a human's house and quickly panic because you think he can see your alien form. But your cloaking device has triggered and is jammed on. You must wander the wasteland and search for your crew in efforts to bring them home

This play through will limit you to energy weapons, luck, and agility will get you around most situations. Do not waste your time killing petty humans unless it is absolutely necessary. Instead rely only superior thought.

-Build your character with Charisma and Luck as their highest stats. Take Lady Killer or Confirmed Bachelor as your first perk (or Black Widow or Cherchez le Femme if you're a Jane Bond).

-You wear only nice clothes

-Only use pistols and SMG's for guns, 9 iron, straight razor, or katana for melee. No dynamite, only grenades or C4 for explosives.

-Play Hardcore mode, dogs, molerats, or coyotes, pork and beans, cave fungus, or anything served on a stick. Only quality cooked meat, and packaged food

-Don't sleep outdoors.

-You have a drink of choice, or wine for alcohol. 

-You can't take Jet, Slasher, Buffout, or any tribal recipe or insect derived chems.

-No scavenging from trashcans or dumpsters.

-No stealing or taking items from obviously owned homes/areas. If you can't resist stealing or taking an owned item

They did a really good job in showing how each faction had both good and bad aspects, somewhat condescending to locals, and riddled with bureaucracy and corruption.  House is a man with a plan, a master strategist and also has a plan for rebuilding society, even advancing it from what it was before the war, but he cares nothing about any group of people and refuses to let anyone or any group have power besides himself.  Going independent means the most freedom for the people of the region, but it also means a loss of structure and law.  There's no ""right"" answer

It seems like the designers want you to automatically hate the Legion. They constantly refer to you as profligate and Caesar is so dismissive, slaves, glory, territory) it might have made the game a bit deeper.    

Its also not helped by the fact that despite being one of the three big powers in the Mojave, but there's no denying it can get stuff done.""

While thinking about *where* it should take place

I think a Fallout set in the immediate aftermath of the nuclear war of 2077 would be exciting.  Perhaps 2078 would be a good year.  

Ghouls would be new and people's reaction to them would be less jaded and casual and more OMG WTF panic! 

Maybe the player could even retrace the existing Fallout backstory to an extent; perhaps his story could link with that of the Army unit that eventually became the Brotherhood of Steel.

The player could encounter actual Chinese military units left over from an invasion.

The game could start with the character being forced outside a Vault as a forced recon volunteer

Or maybe the player is a guy who didn't get into a Vault and is struggling to survive

Maybe this Fallout could add vehicles, however, be cool if the player could create an improvised armored car, [Libyan-rebel style](http://www.nationaljournal.com/the-homemade-weapons-of-libya-s-rebel-forces-20110615).  The player could drive in real-time while using VATS to aim the gun.  Once you've programmed your shots into VATS and unpaused, the gun would fire off-screen while you drive.  Each vehicle could have a certain number of Action Points, or you could have a ""Driving"" skill that affects vehicle AP.

Edit: Perception could set Driving Action Points

We had a nasty run in with Cazadors north of Good Springs and in turning a corner met a young Death Claw. It nearly killed us. So we decided we'd hunt. We'd hunt deathclaws! With ratslayer.

Into the quarry he went, slowly took out 1 ... 2 ... 3 ... 4 deathclaws. All of his ammo was spent. So he retreated. He proceeded to pick up any kind of ammo that would help - regular, armor piercing, hallow point. He returned. This time he worked his way around to the Khan makeshift camp and the meetup above. Slowly he worked down and finally ... 

All ammo was used in taking the Alpha and the Deathclaw mother. From high above he could see them. All day and all night. At the end of it

He left the next morning to get ammo. Upon returning, Lucky, and finished off a deathclaw at close range. He finished the last young death claw with a grenade.

Exhausted, the fat man, mini nukes and the light rifle. He's earned this. Yet he was now over encumbered! He could no longer run or fast travel. So he slowly worked his way back out towards Sloan. Suddenly a red light turned up on his compass. He panned right. A deathclaw. Lucky was low on ammo. What to do? He quickly armed the fat man and flung the mini nuke in a desperate attempt to survive. The explosion threw him to the ground. But the red blip was gone and so was the deathclaw- carcass and all.

March 22th

Command approved the mission - 15 of us going into the Mojave

March 28th

Passed through the old Mojave Outpost today. Statues are surprisingly still standing. Securitron checkpoint refused to let us pass without paying for a passport. Some things never change.

April 1st

Finally saw some action today - raiders tried to ambush us

April 2nd

When we walked into Novac today I thought we had the wrong place. Place was guarded by Ghouls. In robes. Now I've seen everything.

April 4th

Intel was right

April 5th

Wasted the entire day tracking a power armor signature - we heard the target used one at the Dam. Close but no cigar - just some gal keeping an old Brotherhood armor in her shack. Pleasant girl

We've been had. The ""good luck charm"" that bitch gave us was a homing beacon. Reams found the transmitter a little too late. By the time we backtracked to that shack she was already gone.

April 6th

Spent the whole night tracking her

April 7th

I don't know what happened. We finally found her. We had barely laid eyes on her when she opened fire with a .308. Reams and Thomas got hit before they could get in cover. Then she aimed HELIOS One at us, but she had vanished.
I didn't think cutting off New Vegas' head would be easy

April 8th

Made a base of operations in Vault 34. Place was riddled with skeletons and picked clean. It still has power and it's about as hidden away and secure as we can get in this. Cooper and Ward are gathering more intel.

April 12th

I don't like it. Almost a week since contact and nobody's come after us. We can't complete our mission if we're holed up in here. Ward came back yesterday - no luck. Still no word from Cooper.

April 14th

Cooper radioed in using the old Black Mountain equipment. Seems he found out how that bitch got away.

April 18th

Just as Cooper said, no luck.

April 21st

After staking it out for 2 days it happened. She arrived at the satellite just as we guessed. Like the last time, but she kept on moving. Had to scatter when she pulled a Fat Man on us. She escaped in the confusion, but Hill managed to hit her teleportation device. We've been tracking her for 15 hours.

April 22nd

Coyotes, even Cazadors. We're on her trail, but the wildlife is determined to slow us down. Cooper got stung pretty bad, had to leave him behind.

April 24th

A vault. Why does it always have to be a vault? Ward says he still needs time to open her up. I don't like it

April 25th

We sealed the door behind us. Ward had rigged it up so that it would take her hours to reconnect the circuits. That's why we lost.
She had us. She knew exactly what we would do. She never set up any mines or explosives. Didn't chase after us and didn't send her bucketheads at us. Why? So she could lead us underground and lock us in a living tomb. She slipped out

April 30th

Running low on food. Mantises that creep in through the cracks aren't enough anymore. In the time it took us to break in

May 3rd

She's playing with us. The doors just swung open on their own

May 12th

Woke up in Freeside. After following the courier into the 3rd hole in the ground she finally set up a trap - gas. We've been out for 2 days. Followers took care of us and the Kings confiscated all our guns and meds. Seems we have a choice - get out of the Mojave or take our chances against a pack of Deathclaws.

Deathclaws aren't a problem. Deathclaws surrounded by enough radiation to melt our optics is another story. They left out the second bit on purpose. Radiation isn't something we can just work around. Jones broke down and surrendered - we'll be out of the Mojave in 2 days.

June 23rd

Good morning, I'll give you that. You had plenty of chances to get out. Now that's not an option anymore. I poisoned the supplies you bought yesterday. You have about 10 more hours before your organs turn to goo. And thanks for all the mines you kindly left out for me. I'm sure your surviving friends will just LOVE to find a memento of you under their pillows.

1343325259.0,x78b1,Something to think about if you have hollow-point ammo available [x-post r/fallout],Alexander_D,51,9,15,"Ok so here goes! I've always wondered how HP ammo could be effective at all against armoured foes

* DAM - DT = DAM(final)

With hollow-point ammo

* 1.75 DAM - 3 DT = DAM(final)

Now

* 1.75 DAM - 3 DT = DAM - DT
* 1.75 DAM - DAM = 3 DT - DT (rearranged)
* 0.75 DAM = 2 DT 
* DAM = (2/0.75) DT
* DAM = 2.667 (or two and two thirds) DT

From this we can see that **if your DAM is greater than 2.667 times the enemy's DT

* Cazadores have zero DT
* Deathclaws (excluding babies) and Robobrains have a DT of 15. This means that a weapon with a DAM of (15 x 2.667) = 40 or more is *better off* using HP ammo against them.
* Brotherhood Paladins (the most heavily-armoured enemies in-game AFAIK) have a DT of up to 31. In this case

Now that last example isn't very promising except in 1 (potentially 2) case(s): Those of the Brush Gun and Medicine Stick

So it could be said that with a DAM of 83 or more

**EDIT NUMBER ONE AS REQUESTED BY RANDOMTHERAPY: HP v AP

*HOLLOW POINT VERSUS ARMOUR PIERCING:*

* 1.75 DAM - 3 DT = 0.95 DAM - (DT - 15)
* 0.8 DAM = 2 DT + 15
* For D/claws: DAM = 57 to be better than AP ammo
* For BoS Paladins: DAM = 97 (still achievable!) to be better than AP ammo

*HOLLOW POINT VERSUS SWC AMMO:* NOTE THAT SWC IS .45-70 ONLY

* 1.75 DAM - 3 DT = 1.2 DAM - (DT - 6)
* 0.55 dam = 2 DT + 6
* D/claws: DAM = 66 DAM to be better than SWC
* BoS Paladins: DAM = 124 (achievable with the right perks

In another conclusion, reflected in it's relative rarity.*

**EDIT NUMBER TWO:**

randomtherapy also mentioned lower DAM guns such as the All American and in this case (and the case of other weapons where HP ammo is unavailable) I can show that AP ammo is *always* better than standard ammo unless your DAM is (literally) modded to 300:

* DAM - DT = 0.95 DAM - (DT - 15)
* 0.05 DAM = 15
* DAM is 300 for standard ammo to be superior to AP ammo.

Okay, and i think you guys would atleast think what i'm going to say is interesting.


After ""Dead Money"" came out i was crazy to play it, i don't know if any of you guys ever heard about a band called ""Eagles"" and their song ""Hotel California"", but if you're planning on playing Dead money or did it already, hear the song, i'll explain now why.


These are the lyrics of the song:


On a dark desert highway
Warm smell of colitas
Up ahead in the distance
My head grew heavy and my sight grew dim 
I had to stop for the night 
There she stood in the doorway; 
I heard the mission bell 
And I was thinking to myself
""This could be Heaven or this could be Hell"" 
Then she lit up a candle and she showed me the way 
There were voices down the corridor
I thought I heard them say...


(This part of the song obviously shows the beginning of the DLC, and it hears the voices coming from the radio on that small table.)


Welcome to the Hotel California 
Such a lovely place (Such a lovely place) 
Such a lovely face 
Plenty of room at the Hotel California 
Any time of year (Any time of year) 
You can find it here


(Refers to the abandoned Sierra Madre Hotel/Casino


Her mind is Tiffany-twisted
She got a lot of pretty
How they dance in the courtyard
Some dance to remember


(Vera Keyes, one of them, the founder of Sierra Madre, Frederik Sinclair, along with the ""How they dance in the courtyard"" can be explain a vision she had of the Gala when the bombs arrived, she was in her room, but i don't remember if it had windows...)


So I called up the Captain
""Please bring me my wine"" 
He said
And still those voices are calling from far away
Wake you up in the middle of the night 
Just to hear them say...
(I couldn't think anything about the first two lines of this part but, the ghost people in the villa.)


Welcome to the Hotel California 
Such a lovely place (Such a lovely place) 
Such a lovely face 
They livin' it up at the Hotel California 
What a nice surprise (what a nice surprise) 
Bring your alibis


(Once again it's talking about the ghost people


Mirrors on the ceiling
The pink champagne on ice 
And she said ""We are all just prisoners here
And in the master's chambers
They gathered for the feast 
They stab it with their steely knives
But they just can't kill the beast


(The Gala Event, of our own device"" will soon record the DLC players from the device on their necks, but it did also made me remember from Vera's words, ""Let go"" painted on the wall, referring to the final where the player had troubles on the vault's end.)


Last thing I remember
Running for the door 
I had to find the passage back 
To the place I was before 
""Relax
""We are programmed to receive. 
You can check-out any time you like
But you can never leave!""


(This was the best part in my opinion, he had to find the passage back, to the mojave wasteland [The place he was before], the night man was in my mind like the message left in the vault's computer, which says a bit about the Hotel, and after read, will lock you there forever, you could check the vault and the hotel any time you like

**SPECIAL At Character Creation**

*The most important SPECIAL stats are the ones that let you get access to the Perks and weapons (str requirements) you need to play the type of character you want.* As in, etc...

The most valuable stat hands down, because it determines the number of implants you can have. Each point in Endurance is basically a free point in 1 other SPECIAL, and if you have 10 Endurance you can get all 8 (getting End when you're already at 10 doesn't do anything iirc, or I'd say 9) vanilla implants with room for 2 more from DLC.

If you want a well rounded character that has access to lots of Perks, and only in Endurance (already covered, woo), and Agility for running faster while sneaking (7 covers all the damage related Perks). That means you can easily set yourself up to get almost any Perk combination you want in the game if you plan it properly during creation. Oh and beating Lonesome Road gives you +1 to any 1 SPECIAL as well, but by the time you do that the game would probably be over for you.

Here is a handy reference to which SPECIALs unlock which Perks: 

http://fallout.wikia.com/wiki/Fallout:_New_Vegas_primary_statistics

And for Str requirements:

http://fallout.wikia.com/wiki/Fallout:_New_Vegas_weapons

As a new player you will really appreciate the bonus HP you'll get from having 9-10 Con as well. I don't advise trying a light armor sneaky build really until you understand where **the game will really fuck you good for trying a light armor sneaky build** and being prepared for it. One of the best things you can do for yourself besides starting with high Endurance is taking the Toughness perk twice (for 6 Damage Threshold bonus) and the Subdural Implant (obtained from a doctor near New Vegas proper for 8, try to do the Brotherhood of Steel quest line as early as possible so you can gain access to Power Armor. As an added bonus using Power Armor gives you +1-2 bonus Strength depending on the model, so you only need to reach 8-9 Str through Implants / Perks / beginning build points to use any weapon in the game. Noteworthy 10 Str iconic weapons would be the Minigun and Bumper Swords. Super Sledges only require 9 Str iirc, though, and are a fine ""end game"" melee weapon to specialize in. Following what I just told you, you would be death incarnate. Just pick 1 of the 4 weapon types (explosives don't really count) to specialize in and you're good to go. Remember that Melee and Unarmed attacks do double damage if you use VATS targetting with them and they are viable, especially if you follow my tanky build advice. As well, so easy to repair and find ammo for) on hand until you get some decent armor and unarmed / melee weapons.

**Perk Selection Is Easy**

You get 25 Perk selections if you have all the DLC, Rad Absorbtion, Lifegiver, Stonewall, Recycler, Jury Rigging, and Toughness. Don't be afraid of using a Perk or two on Intense Training if you need to get your Strength up for a weapon, are short for another Perk you want

Don't take VATS Perks like Commando or Sniper unless you are into medium range weapons that are hard to aim sometimes due to having a high spread or slow projectile (most plasma weapons fall under this). If you're using long range weapons you'll easily kill many enemies with sneak attacks at far greater range than VATS will let you target things. If you're using close range weapons (SMGs, Super Sledges, Power Fists, or Ballistic Fists, less great with damage over time stuff like Rippers and Chainsaws imo.

**Skill Selection Is Also Easy**

You get +1 SP per TWO Int. That means if you take 4 Int and the Educated perk (provides 2 bonus SP at level up) you'll get as many as someone with 8 Int. Since SPECIALs are harder to manage than Skills or Perks in New Vegas (over 700 SP to spend with only 4 Int and the Educated perk) you really can get away with just taking Educated and keeping your Int at 4. As with perk selection, but Lockpick will get you more loot and a lot of the times where you would need a Science check (hacking) or a key to unlock a door, you can just Lockpick it instead (a lot faster). That being said, Science gives you cool recipes, more dialogue options, and helps you finish quests beyond just hacking terminals. I have yet to run into a dialogue option granted by Lockpick. Get Speech if you are into role playing and solving things more diplomatically, it will let you convince people that fighting is not worth it when resolving a number of quests. Barter will make your transactions more favorable while buying and selling, Repair can save you heaps with the Jury Rigging perk. High end items cost around 10k caps to fully repair if you pay an NPC to do it for you

700 skill points will get you almost 10 skills maxed, etc...). You can ignore Barter, Survival (if you're not playing Hardcore), and 3 weapon types you're not using. Maybe ignore Speech, Sneak, Repair, or Medicine if you're not interested in those

**General Gameplay Tips**

* **Pick up 3 scrap metal, ED-E the eyebot, as soon as you enter the town of Primm (probably the first town you'll enter after you leave Goodsprings). It does a LOT of damage and will save you a lot of ammo / money in the early game. It also doesn't count against your ""real"" companion slot, won't leave you over any decision you make, and acts as a portable science workbench / ammo crafting bench if you own the Lonesome Road expansion (this may be a bug, but it works). *YOU DO* **NOT** *NEED SCIENCE OR REPAIR SKILL TO REPAIR ED-E BY THIS METHOD.*

* **Pick up every antivenom you find**, then use an antivenom after the fight is over, or they'll just repoison you immediately. It is kind of annoying, and you'll run into a lot of Cazadors in the wild if you're exploring and trying to find every location. An easy source of antivenom is killing Caesar's Legion assassins that will come after you if you piss that faction off. They will often carry it, as well as valueable weapons you can sell for lots of caps (at level 20 every assassin squad that comes for me has a Super Sledge and other good weapons).

* **Pick up and keep at least 1 easily concealed ""holdout"" weapon** because there are a few times they will come in handy. The silenced 22 pistol doesn't even require 50 Sneak to keep on you, though, just your earliest). Switchblades, knuckles, etc... can be concealed without 50 Sneak skill, and most melee weapons are silent, just try to get the person you want dead in a place where others can't see you. If you're using a silent ranged weapon though, so silence doesn't matter).

* **If you have more than 6 Luck it is pretty easy to clean out all 3 casinos** in New Vegas. It will net you around 30k-48k depending on how you do it, or just want the maximum possible base critical hit rate (1% per point of Luck), go hog wild.",,False,self,t5_2rzr5,,http://www.reddit.com/r/fnv/comments/y6d37/new_to_vegas_read_this_character_build_new_player/

1287690023.0,duj67,How to play Caravan ,hero0fwar,38,3,22,"Courtesy of The_Final_Cut @ GameFAQS

**First Hand/First card to start your ""Caravans""**

So, the game is ready to go.

**Numerical Direction**

As stated in game, Caravans cards do not need to be in order, but rather any number can be laid onto another if it agrees with the numeric direction.

I.E. Caravan is a 2, giving a total of 10. Once you have laid down the 5, you may then lay down any number *BIGGER* than 5, but you cannot lay down another 5.

It is also worth noting the suits of your cards because it is possible to play a same-suited card regardless of numeric direction.

**Face Cards/Jokers**

Face cards work a little differently than the basic cards

Jacks: Jacks get rid of any card you lay it on. Good for getting rid of cards laid in bad spots or ones that would otherwise make it impossible to lay a card down without going over the 27-point limit.

Queens: Queens change the numeric direction of any Caravan it is placed on. For instance: You need one caravan to win, and 3, making a total of 16 and making your direction descending. In your hand you have all cards higher than a 3 and one queen. If you place the queen on the 3 in this Caravan, any number now BIGGER than 3 can be used, instead of smaller.

Kings: Kings have the most practical and straight-forward use. Any card you play a King on will add the value of the card it is placed on. Lets say your caravan starts with a 10, 26 obviously being more desirable.

Jokers: Jokers are sneaky cards. They have two different uses
If played on an ACE: If you play your Joker on an ace
If played on a card 2-10: If you play a Joker on a card 2-10,7, ect.)

Keep in mind: **ALL FACE CARDS CAN BE USED ON YOUR OPPONENTS CARAVANS AS WELL** Keeping this in mind can save you from sure defeat. Sending your opponent over the 26 point limit making him/her restart their Caravan can be a devastating tactic,,False,self,t5_2rzr5,False,,True

I've been playing New Vegas for years now (always vanilla) and bought Old World Blues and Lonesome Road when they came out. During the Steam summer sale when FNV was on sale yesterday I decided to get Dead Money and Honest Hearts as well. I generally had a lot of fun playing OWB and LR

I was honestly disappointed. I just activated the Gala event and I'm already bored. It feels like every mission is the same. Deadly ghosts, radio signals and of course the cloud. Every time I have to go somewhere there are always the same dangerous elements. Even though it is partly challenging, I feel really bad while playing this. There is simply no variety in this DLC and I don't know how I can keep being motivated to end its storyline.

I was just curious as to what you thought would be good locations for future games.  I have come up with a few:

NYC - Only urban (minus central park) which might get a bit boring but it could still be cool.  If it was only NYC the map might feel a bit small or cramped.  If they expanded the area to be more of the [Eastern](http://fallout.wikia.com/wiki/New_York) or [New England](http://fallout.wikia.com/wiki/Massachusetts) commonwealths they could include/expand on the story behind [the Institute.](http://fallout.wikia.com/wiki/Institute)


[Europe](http://fallout.wikia.com/wiki/Europe) - There is little mention of what is going on in Europe so this could be a cool place to expand.  Perhaps start in mainland Europe and allow the player to explore and/or travel to the UK.  This would allow for a huge map.


Asia - I mostly had Japan/[China](http://fallout.wikia.com/wiki/China) in mind for this but other parts of SE Asia could be included.  It would be cool to see how the US's enemy has survived since the war.  Could also allow for a huge map.


[Chicago](http://fallout.wikia.com/wiki/Chicago) - Fairly new area story wise


[The Core Region](http://fallout.wikia.com/wiki/Core_Region) - Depending on how big of an area the new engine allows for they could make a game that includes most/all of the core region from Fallout1/2/New Vegas.  It would be interesting to see how the stories from all of those areas could tie together.

1372541648.0,1hbx18,Power Brawler | Build Guide,Ganrao,29,5,2,"The **Power Brawler** is an experimental build I'm working on right now. It can do incredible damage with Melee or Unarmed skill

------------------------------------------------------------

Building a Power Brawler is a great idea if you want to play Hardcore mode, lowers max level to 35 even w/ all DLC). A Power Brawler focuses on high Endurance to compensate for the decreased effectiveness of Stimpacks and lower max hp, and Strength with either Melee or Unarmed as a primary weapon to alleviate the harsher weight restrictions (even without J Sawyer's, ammo has weight in hardcore mode). 

Key concepts of the Power Brawler are:

* Use T-51b Power Armor w/ Helmet for maximum protection
* Use VATS to teleport into close range
* Be strong enough to blow away everything with a Minigun if necessary ;)

In combat you will want to use VATS to take out the biggest threats first, you might want to unload with the biggest Guns type weapon you've got just to finish the job / thin out the pack. You CAN go Energy Weapons, but I feel like they work better with a critical hit build, and you're going to have enough Strength to use a Minigun.

If you don't use J Sawyer's Mod this build is still very strong. You will be essentially invincible

---------------------------------------

**POWER BRAWLER REQUIRED PERKS**

[Educated](http://fallout.wikia.com/wiki/Educated) - Amazing for all builds

[Toughness](http://fallout.wikia.com/wiki/Toughness) - Get both ranks! Another great Perk for any build

[Super Slam](http://fallout.wikia.com/wiki/Super_Slam) - Knocking down enemies you don't kill is almost as good as killing them

[Life Giver](http://fallout.wikia.com/wiki/Life_Giver) - Very helpful in J Sawyer's mod due to reduced max hp from other sources

[Piercing Strike](http://fallout.wikia.com/wiki/Piercing_Strike) - You ignore 15 (!) enemy Damage Threshold (that is a LOT)

[Adamantium Skeleton](http://fallout.wikia.com/wiki/Adamantium_Skeleton) - Very useful in Hardcore

[Action Girl](http://fallout.wikia.com/wiki/Action_Girl) - The best VATS perk for close combat along with GRS

[Grim Reaper's Sprint](http://fallout.wikia.com/wiki/Grim_Reaper%27s_Sprint) - Just hilarious

[Implant GRX](http://fallout.wikia.com/wiki/Implant_GRX) - Free non-addicting turbo

[Thought You Died](http://fallout.wikia.com/wiki/Thought_You_Died) - For positive karma characters

OR

[Ain't Like That Now](http://fallout.wikia.com/wiki/Ain%27t_Like_That_Now) - For negative karma characters

-----------------------------------------------

**POWER BRAWLER OPTIONAL PERKS**

[Plasma Spaz](http://fallout.wikia.com/wiki/Plasma_Spaz) - Improved in J Sawyer's Mod to also give +20% attack speed on Plasma weapons

[Finesse](http://fallout.wikia.com/wiki/Finesse_(perk\)) - 5 Luck worth of crit

[Slayer](http://fallout.wikia.com/wiki/Slayer) - Good raw melee DPS boost when out of Action Points

[Rad Absorption](http://fallout.wikia.com/wiki/Rad_Absorption) - 10x more 
effective with J Sawyer's

---------------------------------------

**POWER BRAWLER SPECIAL &amp; SKILLS**

The *minimum* SPECIAL scores (at character creation) to get all of the required Perks and use a Minigun or Bumper Sword are:

8 Strength

8-10 Endurance

4 Intelligence

5-? Agility

You will need to raise Strength via an implant

You can of course implant Endurance and Intelligence if you want to move those points, and you may want to consider taking 10 Endurance at creation just to max your hp out for the rest of the game anyway.

Agility needs to get to 6 with an implant for Action Girl

There aren't many (any?) skill requirements outside of 70 in Unarmed (or Melee if using J Sawyer's) to get all the required Perks.

Look up the minimum skill requirements to get the optional perks you want and try to have them ready when the Perk becomes available. Aside from that you are free to customize the rest of your SPECIAL / Skills / Perks however you want. I recommend maxing Lockpick on every character, and general exploring.

**Enjoy! Hope you have as much fun with this build as I do :D**

ps: my personal ""power gaming"" SPECIAL pick at creation for this build is:

8 Strength

1 Perception (ED-E gives max radar range anyway)

9 Endurance

1 Charisma

3 Intelligence (will beat the Casinos to pay for the mod early as possible)

9 Agility (max Action Points!)

9 Luck (+15% Base Critical Hit chance w/ Finesse now

I will implant all of these values eventually because I have enough Endurance to do so and also get the health regen and +DT implants.

1. **Incapacitation.** Allow for an ""incapacitated"" status for companions. They'll still be able to die if they take too much damage (like over 120% of their HP), run off a cliff, get into a fight with five radscorpions, and die before I can rescue them. If you get to them while they are ""incapacitated"", you can revive them using a Doctor's bag.

2. **Fewer containers/storage lockers** (or more w/ the &lt;Empty&gt; tag). I don't know why there are SO. MANY. BOXES. Visiting a school? Time to check out all fifty lockers! I feel like a hoarder w/ 300 lbs of fission batteries playing post-apocalyptic Storage Wars. **edit**: maybe there shouldn't be any less containers, and work areas. I think boxes belong in storage areas (like closets, garages, houses, etc.) but that's just me.

3. **Thirsty Mode** I need to get thirstier

4. **Wild Wasteland** Wild Wasteland should not be a perk (i just think everyone should get the jokes).

5. **Crafting Revamp** Make crafting ""fun"". I appreciate the crafting &amp; reloading benches, say, 5 rounds of 50MG ammo. Streamline it: if you have X and want to build Y, and you could build Y with the broken down parts of X, then just give me the option to build Y instead of forcing me to go through the whole process It just takes too long and it's not fun.

6. **Stimpacks Logical Placement** Keep the # stimpacks/super stimpacks low and confined to places that make sense

7. **Poison Status** Let me know on-screen when I'm poisoned. You don't have to make it easier for me to cure myself

8. **Random Encounter - Sleeping** Random encounters while sleeping (this could be fun) out in the open (away from towns or dungeon areas). So, the hit squad) can get to you before you wake up. This also encourages players to be smarter about where they sleep.

9. **Dialogue w/ your gun out** You should get a -1 charisma if you don't holster your gun. It just makes no sense that you could walk into the doctor's office with a gatling laser out and have them be cool with that. This also incentives more folks to go unarmed/melee/one-handed (because you can unholster much faster) w/o having to give players crazy advantages like a super-powerful uppercut.

10. **Caravan Delivery Service** Allow me to give caravans some of my stuff (up to 100 lbs?) so they can deliver it to a place of my choosing. I guess you could integrate it with the mailbox system (which was wonky itself) - shrug.

11. **Disarm Player** Unarmed enemies should have a decent chance of disarming you of your weapon (melee and ranged weapons).

12. **Kidnapped** Be able to be kidnapped and robbed. If you are defeated (but not killed - see incapacitated above) you will be stripped of your inventory and caps. When you come to, a back alley, the railroad tracks, or in a lake w/ very few supplies and minimal health. You'd be notified of the location of your kidnappers on the World map so you can get your stuff back. While inconvenient for the player, this would add another dimension to the gameplay and make it fun to hunt down your kidnappers.

13. **Unwanted intruder** - if you are in neutral territory

14. **Crippled Head** - if your head becomes crippled (yikes)

15. **new: Health from Stimpacks is Temporary** - since a stimpack is basically an adrenaline shot, autodocs, &amp; crafting much, much more important.

Also, but permanent health recovery).",,False,self,t5_2rzr5,True,,

[Pushy](http://fallout.wikia.com/wiki/Pushy)-For close quarters

Sniper Rifle(silenced/carbon)- Having a silenced long range weapon is always useful.

[All American](http://fallout.wikia.com/wiki/All-American)- My basic weapon


So this last one is my Holy Grail:


I used to use the Anti-Materiel Rifle until I found the [YCS/186](http://fallout.wikia.com/wiki/YCS/186_Gauss_rifle).


I equip it with Max Charge Microfusion Cells.  It fires 4 cells/shot and 1 Max Charge takes 5 Microfusion Cells to craft.  So essentially it takes 20 MFC for 1 shot but...


YCS/186 + Max Charge MF Cell = 237 DAM/ 754 DPS

If you have  [Rapid Reload](http://fallout.wikia.com/wiki/Rapid_Reload) the DPS is even more.

There aren't many enemies who can last more than 1 blast from the 186.

There are still plenty of times where I use melee or unarmed if there are only one or two enemies.  But my point is I could just as well use guns or energy weapons.

My build is something like:  
 6 Str, 6 Cha, 7 Int, 8 Agil, 5 Luck  
And for lols I picked Light Frame for one of my traits.
  
Here was my day:
  

* Sided with the Goodspringers so I could get Sunny Smiles as a companion.
* Found a 9mm assault rifle and fell in love.  
* Sniped every Powder Ganger I could hit without entering the prison.
* Took 2 hours from game start to finally arrive in Primme.  
* Got EDE.
* Did some quests for the NCR outpost.  
* Found a giant freaking harpoon gun in the middle of a scorpion swarm.
* Had both my arms and legs broken by Legion Hounds in Nipton.
* Only had enough Doctor's Kits to repair legs.
* Couldn't hit the broad side of a barn because of broken arms.  
* Had both legs broken **AGAIN** in a fight with some gunmen.  
* Slowly limped toward Novac with both arms and legs broken.  
* Finally arrived and found the doctor.
* Bought a bed at the inn.
* Collapsed into bed to recover from my massive sleep dep.

I can't get enough of this uber-hardcore stuff.

So I was looking for quests to do for the NCR by visiting some NCR bases. I fast traveled to The Fort, and join him on this slaughter. So me and Boone slowly make our way up hill towards Ceaser's tent. I killed legion soldiers left and right and eventually make it to Ceasers tent. Once in there every body starts rushing me through the tent door hole and Boone goes unconscious. With Boone Unconscious and me realizing this has turned into a 1v7 fight, i switch to my Annabelle and and start to firing on them. After killing all of Ceaser's guards and him I loot all their ballistic fist/glove weapons and their armor and sell them.

There's this mod which changes up some of the music played from in-world radios/speakers (ie casinos) to other, Billie Holiday, Julie London, etc) But doesn't touch the version of the tracks that would play on your pip-boy. Great if you're the kind of person who plays with the radio off and enjoys the ones in-game.

* I don't know what to do with my guns. I'm currently using a 10mm
* I'm very frustrated by some of the requirements that seem high at my level. I helped the ghouls get in their rockets at the REPCONN facility but couldn't correct their trajectory because my Science skill wasn't enough (55 needed). Is that a normal thing ?

____

First of all, I'm not sure if I'm playing it correctly. And because I've been lurking here for and notice everyone has different types of ""builds"", I'm making myself worry/overthink. Here's a rundown on my status:

* Downloaded Ultimate Edition which starts me out with weird missions
* 17 hours logged
* May have accidentally read lockpicking magazines in Goodsprings thinking they were permanent
* Powder Gangers hate me
* Skills: Guns 58, Sneak 41, Speech 33, rest &lt; 20
* S.P.E.C. = 6
* Perks: Educated, bug stomp, strong back, swift learner

So some basic questions

* ~~How do I know what magazines I find laying around are permanent skill enhancers? Which are temporary? Only after I was level 4 did I find the [sniper guide](http://seedykiwi.hubpages.com/hub/New-Vegas-Sniper#) but I realize it may be too late with low skills.~~ question was answered

* ~~When I try to sell Lightweight Metal armor to Chet

*~~I always find myself going back to Goodsprings for buying/selling, NCR Mohave) have only offered me aid/food type things~~ question was answered, continue exploring/searching and I should run into more vendors. Should stop into Novac after exploring the SouthEast

* ~~I realized yesterday all the missions I've been doing are rather minor. Also I figured out ""Dead Money"" and ""Lonesome Road"" are giving me mission lines that I think I'm not ready for yet. Do I just ignore these? Pip-Boy is getting cluttered.~~ Question answered

I was super excited to start New Vegas (Ultimate Edition) and it just came in the mail about a week ago.

Unfortunately

 - So many things are copied from FO3.  It's very weird for me to recognize textures and set pieces from a previous games.  Even some dialogue filler lines are the same.  It feels like a huge expansion pack to me.

 - I feel like I can't explore as much.  In NV, and heading out past the cemetery, I got massacred by Cazadors.  In FO3, I did a run all the way to Rivet City to get the Science Bobblehead, without unmanageable difficulty.

 - I realize I'm probably very alone on this

 - I was disappointed to see the the size of the map is actually deceiving.  Although it appears to be a huge square

I've read through the various guides on character builds (like on [GamesRadar](http://www.gamesradar.com/fallout-new-vegas-character-build-guide/))

*Melee*? Not for me. 

*Sniper*? Could be a great deal of fun

*Heavy Weapons*? Again

*Laser Gunner* sounds like it could be fun. Same goes for the *Wasteland Negotiator* and *Thief Extraordinaire*. 

In terms of companions, so maybe I should try and create a character based around that.
