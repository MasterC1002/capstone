1363847750.0,1apwzj,I tried to kill myself.,ThrowawayKa,1701,219,122,"I'm not really sure if this belongs here

When I was 15 I was incredibly depressed and struggling with my OCD and anxiety. It got to the point that I decided to kill myself. I arranged everything (Note, how etc.) and waited. I waited about a week until my parents went out to dinner. I attached a note to my door telling my parents not to come in and to just call the police, got dressed in my nicest clothes, showered, did my hair, and put a suicide note in my shirt pocket. My father had a number of guns and I chose one of them to do the deed with -- a Beretta 92 handgun or something like that. I went into my bedroom, turned on some music and laid down on my bed. I put the barrel into my mouth

Then it went into a third person type thing where I was just watching myself. I saw myself laying dead on my bed

The gun jammed. I just threw it onto the ground and sobbed into my pillow for hours before cleaning up everything and going to sleep.

So one day I was out in front of my apartment building smoking a cigarette, gone out to a bar, then gone to my place, after which she took a taxi home. So as I'm standing out in front of my apartment building, she pulls up in a taxi. I wasn't expecting her, and was pleasantly surprised to see her. I put out my cigarette, smiled and walked up saying something like ""Hey

She scours at me, just barged past me into the building. 

I followed her up to my apartment, grabs her bag and some of her stuff she left there, throws a few things at me, breaking a glass or two and knocking down a bunch of stuff on a shelf. Shecalls me a pig, says she knows everything, and that I've broken her heart. I'm trying to figure out what's going on obviously, and she stops on her way out when I touch her sleeve, and drove off. The street was pretty empty

Then, and its her, in running clothes (she was wearing heels and a leather jacket before), and I went completely pale. She said ""hi"" in her usual happy-go-lucky tone, then noticed my look and said ""what's wrong"". 

I spun around, and all the lights were red. I didn't say anything to her, just ran upstairs. Her bag was gone, things were still broken, my door still wide open. So then I told her. 

We were both monumentally confused, and sure enough, Me following a girl to my apartment. The angles weren't great, and the film wasn't great quality, but it was pretty easy to see me and my face, but hers was always hard to make out looked a hell of a lot like her, but never a clear shot. 

No way it was the same girl. 

Still creeps me the fuck out

EDIT: Someone in the comments made me realize I should add to the follow up of this: we did file a police report, and found only my fingerprints and my girlfriend's on them, same with my door, and this girl got into my building herself, which means she knew my door code. Her typing it in is on the footage. I just hope I never see her again.

EDIT 2: Brought up in a conversation with /u/ZapActions-dower  I had a conversation with a professor at columbia (family friend) about this situation ""hypothetically"", running a nearly identical timeline, folded over ours or collided with ours temporarily. Maybe she saw me at the bar the night before with another girl (my girlfriend), not seeing her face, and decided to break up with me the next morning,coming to my apartment. Then the amount of a disturbance that resulted in caused our two worlds to break apart right as she drove away. I'm not really one to believe in those things, but after this, that makes me wonder

EDIT 3: Thanks everyone for the theories and suggestions! This is the first time my girlfriend and I have gone into thinking about this in a while

I've been reading the stories on this subreddit and have enjoyed them
It happened in early 2000 when I was working at a juvenile detention center in a small town in Oklahoma as a corrections officer. I was working nights at the time and went to work at nine p.m.

This one night when I arrived for work my supervisor looked confused and asked me what I was doing there. I said ""I work tonight."". And he said ""But they said you called in a few hours ago saying that you were sick."". I was a bit confused and said ""It must have been someone else and they got the message wrong."".

After everyone else showed up for work that night it was a bit more weird, phones and everything. After I relieved the guard on duty and settled in for the night, I looked at the message that said I called in. It said that I had called at 6:50 and said that I had gotten sick while out cleaning up after the storm. There had been a storm the night before and it was a bit bad, but not anything that I had to go out to clean up. It was truly weird.

The supervisor came into the control about that time. He was also a friend of mine outside work and we started talking about it, I had to get home, and I took off towards the door. I could hear Dave pick up the phone behind me and say ""Hello?"" followed soon after by ""What the fuck!"" rather loudly.

I ran to my car and drove home faster then what was legal, but the phone was dead.

I went back to work and when I came in Dave was acting weird and asked me ""How the hell are you doing this?"". He told me that when I left

I declined and said we had somewhere to be (I was taking my friend out to lunch with other friends) and that we didn't have time. The palmist seemed disappointed and said, mind you, but a slice. So my friend tore a corner off some notebook paper.

Fast-forward to 2012. Last year I proposed to a girl and she said yes. We're getting married in the fall

A few nights after the proposal I had dinner with that friend and she said, we went back to my place and met up with my fiance. I opened the drawer, dug around for a while and found the slip of paper. When I unfolded it, all three of our jaws dropped. 

It read: 
""Remember

Back-story-time: Me and my then girlfriend(let's call her Audrey) went to see a movie a couple years ago(Transporter 3...?), and never had the chance for a pre-flick cigarette.

Anyway, a friend(call him Mike) of ours came up and asked if we wanted join him for a smoke. As we walked out of the building Audrey took the plastic off the pack we just bought, took out a smoke for the both of us to share, and tossed the plastic into a trash can. As we stood talking to Mike, a guy came up to us and asked Audrey for a smoke, and she told him we were smoking our last one. This guy didn't take kindly to that, and started shouting about how she's lying and how she has no right to lie to him. We offered him a ""sorry dude"" and tried to walk away. Then things got messy. He grabbed Audrey's wrist and wouldn't let go, I'm not going to let someone harm the person I love, my coat was getting wet, I saw the red all over my coat and the knife the guy was holding. My vision started going black and sounds became muffled. As I felt gravity overcome me

Then I was inside the movie theater, and Audrey quickly declined. We left the theater, without saying a word to each other. I decided to break one of my own rules and asked Audrey for a cigarette when we got in my car. She took them out of her jacket and put the plastic-less pack on the dash in front of me. I began shaking when I opened it and saw a single smoke missing. Audrey let out the most fearful scream I have ever heard in my life when we drove past a guy walking through the parking lot. It was him. She insisted she stay the night at my house.

When we arrived at my place, but that was the extent to which we ever talked about it. And I'm sure this experience is what led to the end of our relationship, things got too intense between us after this.

A few years ago i was living in a house with some friends. One afternoon 4 people were home: my boyfriend, but just assumed he was a neighbor kid. We didn't really know many of our neighbors, so the fact that we didn't recognize him wasn't alarming. He asked if his mom was there. We told him that she wasn't.

The boy pushed passed us and just walked into our home. The layout of our house consisted of a living room and a kitchen that you entered into and then their was a hallway leading to 2 bedrooms and a bathroom. One of the bedrooms led to another tiny room (like a sunroom type thing) which had a door leading to the back yard. This door was kept locked with a deadbolt. The kid bolts back into the hallway towards the bedrooms. We are all just in shock that he would just rush into our house like that, so its a few moments before one of my roommates and i follow him back. We check the first room. He's not there. Check the bathroom. Not there. Check the other bedroom and sunroom. Not there. And the back door is still deadbolted, so he couldn't have left. Plus we would have heard it open. We started checking cupboards, closets and under the beds to see if he was hiding. All the windows were closed and too high for him to reach anyway. He couldn't have just run back out the front door either since my other roommate and boyfriend were still in the living room. He. just. disappeared. We still have no idea what happened.

Anyways, but I don't remember the pain much. A bunch of adults offered to help me, but in my distress I refused and rushed into the stairs hallway to get to my dad one floor above. 

This is where everything got weird. 

The stairs were pretty standard. There would be a flight of stairs, I immediately realized that the floor I was on was the 7th floor due to the fact that there were no offices (the 7th floor was a dark storage room). Thinking that I probably just missed the 6th in my rush, I walked down a flight, stopped at the small mid-way platform, and walked down another flight. 

It was the 5th floor. The little ""**5**"" that marked each floor was on the wall next to the door

At this point I was frustrated but had calmed down. There was simply no way this could happen. I only had to count my steps carefully, as well as the little ""**7**"" on the wall. Turning my head the other way, I could then see the ""**5**"" from the 5th floor. This way, ""**7**"", that way, ""**5**."" I didn't even have to move. There was *nothing* in between the two floors except for the little platform I was standing on. 

By now I was sufficiently creeped out to return to the 5th floor and stay put. I stayed there for the rest of the day until a nice woman offered to take me upstairs to my dad. 

This time I was nervous but also a bit curious. Would it happen again now that there are two people? I don't remember much from this point except for one chilling detail. Earlier in my frenzy to find the 6th floor, walking up again, I could see a little trail of dark, brownish red spots leading up the stairs. To my horror, the spots almost immediately disappeared before it could reach the little mid-way platform, as if I had never even step foot there.

My roomate's boyfriend came over and we were talking about setting up a time to get some people together and get a few drinks before he leaves for the summer. I get his number as he's leaving, is this really Kuuz?"". I figure he's just kidding around and I don't bother responding.

The next morning I was walking downtown with my housemates in a crowd of about 800 people or so (I live in a pretty big city and this was in the middle of downtown during a small street festival) and I bumped into this girl I met once a couple of weeks prior. We exchange the usual niceties and she mentions she's with some friends that apparently know me. I go to meet them and was shocked to see it was an old hockey buddy from the middle east with whom I haven't spoken in almost 7 years and his sister. They had just arrived in Canada recently. This is where it gets weird though. We talk for a bit and do the usual catching up, I actually got a text from you yesterday"". I thought he was kidding until he pulled out his phone and showed me. Turns out it was the exact text exchange between me and what I thought to be my housemates boyfriend from the day before. So in short, by some ridiculous coincidence, I mistyped my buddy's number into my phone and texted who turned out to be an old hockey friend that I hadn't seen or talked to in 7 years who had also just arrived in Canada, then proceeds to bump into him in a huge crowd of people downtown not 12 hours after the initial exchange. What. The. Fuck.

When I was 5 or 6 years old I had a vision: 
My mother and I attended an open house as my parents were hoping to move to a new area of town. My mother and I had been doing this type of thing a lot recently, wore suspenders and had big clear thick rimmed glasses. I remember him vividly. 


We were the only people in the open house, but something felt off. The man brings us upstairs and begins showing us a bathroom that connects two bedrooms. We are standing with our backs against one door and he is standing with his back against the other; we are facing each other. Suddenly, he pulls out a handgun and shoots my mother in the face. I feel her blood and brain matter splatter onto me. He then shoots me in the face and everything goes black. 


This wasn’t a dream as I was not asleep, see, taste vividly) which was something that had never happened before. I blew it off because I was a kid with an active imagination. 


The next part is where the glitch happens. About a month or so later my mother takes me to an open house. Lo and behold


I told my mom that we needed to leave and that we were in danger. My mother is strong believer in the power of intuition, “Excuse me,” and walked out of the room to greet the other guests. I told my mom what had just happened; she was quite shaken by that and we left immediately.

So, so my parents decided to get a hotel and come up to visit me. We did family stuff, went hiking and out to eat, yadda yadda. 

Well

So this morning get to the hotel at around 10:45ish. I walk through the lobby and there are people eating the free breakfast. I press the up button for the elevator, press ""5"", and the doors close. 

As soon as the doors close

Imagine that your life is a book. Someone is reading this book, then they continue reading. When I get this feeling, that's what it feel's like is happening to me. A page in the book of my life is being turned, and things have to pause momentarily. 

Anyways

So I'm in the elevator

The elevator gets to the 5th floor, I was expecting people to be packed up and headed down to the lobby but whatever. 

I start walking to their room (512) and I feel like I am the only person on the whole floor. It is dead quiet. Again

I get to their door, I just like to know if he's in there before I enter). But when I look through the peephole, it's totally back. Nothing. 

I thought this strange since I could make things out yesterday. At this point I'm getting really paranoid because I still have that strange feeling, like it does when you are out of service. Now, I get bad reception on my campus, usually 1 or 2 bars, but I don't ever actually lose service. 

So as you can imagine, which I again find strange since it's checkout time and these are the only elevators, I figure it would have been called to another floor by now. 

I get in, and *boom*. The feeling is gone. The elevator arrives at the lobby, and as I step off a family is waiting to get on. A man who I assume was the dad says ""Fucking finally,"" as if they had been waiting a long time for it. 

People are still eating breakfast

So, she presses the 7, doors close. No weird feeling. We go up. I get off at 5. 

Now this time the 5th floor is full of life. There are people waiting with their luggage to get on the elevator

I get my room 512, I have 2 fucking bars, standing in the exact same spot as before. 

I knock on the door

So what the fuck happened? Had the fifth floor not ""loaded"" yet for me? What the hell? I'e been thinking about it all day,False,,t5_2tcwa,False,,,t3_13qyi1

1362427184.0,19nn8e,Long read but definitely the strangest thing I've ever experienced,hicks53081,393,62,139,"My best friend found this subreddit. He told me I need to share this story. It’s kind of weird and unbelievable. I have no proof it happened

In the winter of 2009 my brother and I took a road trip from Portland

On the trip to Port St Lucie we took a combination of freeways from the northwest all the way down to the southeast corner (basically a diagonal route)

On the trip back to Portland we decided to take I-10 the entire way. This stretch of freeway runs all the way from Florida to Los Angeles and would completely keep us away from the snow. The I-10 route added several hundred miles
 
The first day of the return trip was uneventful, which would leave us with about a fourteen hour final day drive. The trip was going well. It wasn’t until we left San Antonio that the glitches started happening.

The car we took on this trip was a 2008 Honda Civic Hybrid. The entire trip we had been getting right around 35mpg (this is digitally displayed on the dash)
 
About 100 miles outside San Antonio, but I reasoned it to possibly driving uphill the entire way (I still don’t know)? I thought throughout the course of an entire tank of fuel that it would eventually balance itself out and we would finish the tank within that 35mpg range. I was wrong.

I kept a very detailed log of this entire trip, and I have almost come to the conclusion that it was an intentional glitch in order to make us pullover where we did.

Our original plan was to refuel about 50 miles later in a town that I cannot remember, Nevada, we headed back onto the road in which the GPS directed. Pretty soon after we got back on the road we realized we were no longer on I-10 heading west, instead we were north on highway 285 (here’s a TIL for some people. Evenly numbered highways and freeways are heading East/West while odds are north/south). We didn’t think much about being off the interstate because many times throughout the drive we had been directed onto bypass highways. We assumed this was just another such instance.

After about an hour and a half of driving on highway 285 we crossed into New Mexico

Nearly five hours after refueling in Fort Stockton, they are small and on the verge of becoming ghosts. I think their economies are built around helping travelers fill up their gas tanks. Other than that, I cannot see a reason for them to exist.

My brother and I have talked about what happened next so many times, and then about 20 miles later we drove through a town call Encino, NM which did not have a gas station (that we can recall). In fact, the second town didn’t really seem to have much there if anything. I wasn’t sure if anyone was living there. I seem to remember questioning why it existed in the first place, but then quickly dismissing it and driving right through.

Not even ten miles after passing through Encino, because I was using a cheap handheld that lost its signal all the time, but usually the only things it didn’t display were newly built roads and recent construction areas. This city was definitely not brand new, so I figured the GPS was being buggy. The oddest part of finding this city, neither of us remembers seeing any warning we were coming up on a town of this size. It had several fast food joints, restaurants, hotels, grocery store (Albertsons maybe) and even some bars. If I were to guess

We decided to pull off and grab a bite to eat. Normally we probably would have grabbed some fast food, and I guess my brother was in the mood for something other than fast food.  I went along with the suggestion because I was sick of eating junk.

((((((for the rest of this story


We pulled into the Ruby Tuesday’s parking lot, is that N and G?’ Both my brother and I answered that it was indeed us, and the waitress went on to ask how life was in Portland. Suddenly it clicked, this girl knows who we are, but we are over 1,000 miles from home. Did we know her from back home?

My brother and I both gave very basic vague answers to her question, which was the same question I was going to ask him. I told him that I had no idea who she was, and that she obviously had mistaken us with some other people.  Not more than a minute later this guy bartender comes up and says, “No fucking way, G and N. You back for jobs?”

What? My brother went on to tell the guy they had us mistaken with some other people.  He laughed and dismissed my brother’s response as a joke. The bartender continued on seamlessly and started asking us how we fared in the three month anatomy and physiology course we had taken at Oregon State.

I remember thinking all of the sudden; this is not a coincidence anymore. My brother and I had taken a three month 15 credit A&amp;P class at Portland State University when we were in our early 20’s (We were late 20’s when this interaction happened). Finally, “Oh damn, you guys just look really similar to some people that used to work here.” 

He apologized and claimed he had to get back to work. After a bit

This had quickly become the most awkward meal of our lives.  It went from people acting like it was a celebration for us to have shown up to everyone avoiding eye contact with us at all cost. After we finished up with our meals the waitress came told us the cash registers were frozen and that our meal was on the house. 

I really wanted to ask the waitress what the name of the city was that we were in

This city strip was a one way road on the eastern side of the highway. When we left Ruby Tuesday’s the only way to turn was right

The rest of the trip was very ordinary. We talked at length about how weird that Ruby Tuesday’s was in the middle of New Mexico. We came up with solutions about how we had doppelgangers with the same names. We joked about how people that look similar follow the exact same paths in life regardless of their upbringing. We talked ourselves into it being a major coincidence. When we finally got back to Portland we decided to do a little research and find out the name of this town.
 
Here is the google maps picture of that stretch of highway. 

http://i.imgur.com/sY3NB89.jpg

We know we refueled at a truck stop at the intersection of 285 and I-40
We have never really been able to answer what happened that day. I can still vividly remember the waitress’s face of unease by the way my brother and I were behaving, but we have never been able to find the solution.

Maybe some redditors can give me an answer or maybe this was just a glitch. Maybe someone has driven that stretch of road and knows the town. 

tl;dr apparently my brother and I worked at a Ruby Tuesday's in the middle of New Mexico

I was sat on the sofa on my laptop, I was gonna get you a mcdonalds."" I went to look for it, and couldn't find it anywhere, so I called it from the house phone. It said it was busy or something, I can't remember now. Confused, I carried on looking for it. Thought maybe it was out of battery or I'd accidentally not put down the phone from the last call. 5 minutes later, I found it on my bed under a pile of clothes. The screen was lit, so the screen was like this: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:IPhone_call_screen.png 

At the top, I thought I must have accidentally called him and then put my phone down and left it there? I don't know. It said the call had been going on for 43 minutes. Then I remembered that I don't have any credit or minutes on my phone, so he must have called me and I answered by accident. But I couldn't understand why he would have let the call go on for 43 minutes when I wasn't there. All this thinking took place within about two or three seconds. I put the phone a little closer to my face to check it said 43 minutes, and I heard something. A sniff. And then another one, like somebody was crying. I put the phone to my ear and heard another sniff, and then the fucking creepiest thing in the world happened. I heard my *own voice*. I, future me, whatever it was, I was just hearing it on the phone. It sounded like I had a cold or I'd been crying. It was quite hoarse, I couldn't say anything

Michael: I don't mind

Other me (I can’t remember my exact words, and Sarah's just not in the right frame of mind to do it. I thought she was feeling better after yesterday but she picked up some of her stuff today, her purse and that. She had an organ donor card in it, but I don't think she'd have been able to donate, you know because it was cancer? 

Michael: Yeah.

Other me: So Sarah got really upset about that. 


By this point, mentioning my sister (sarah) yet I was listening to it. I couldn't listen any longer, I was too confused. The other me started speaking again, and so did I. I didn't hear what she said, but I said 'hello?' The conversation went absolutely silent. Then Michael said 'what?' I panicked, and in my panic, I ended the call. I took a few seconds to calm down and breathe, it disappeared so quickly that I’m doubting myself remembering it

1)	Michael is my ex boyfriend
2)	It sounded like I was talking about my grandma

Both lead to me think that I was hearing an alternate me, and then I’ve just been going through the whole thing in my head. I don’t know what to do. I’m scared. I’m scared of what just happened, and I’m scared to ring Michael and see if he knows anything. I didn’t want to forget any of the conversation so I typed it up pretty fast afterwards. So many things are going through my head right now. What the fuck just happened?

Tl;dr I heard myself and my ex boyfriend having a conversation over the phone about a funeral and my sister.

I have always loved the outdoors. I was fortunate enough to be born in the great Pacific Northwest, and hunting. There are parts of the Cascades I know like the back of my hand. One of those places is called Goblin Creek up the Index-Galeema road off Highway 2. When I was a kid we would drive up there to do some fishing and shooting, but also to collect a specific type of rock that when cut in half and polished would resemble a scenic picture of the view of mountains from within a cave. I do not recall the true name of these stones, we just called them picture rocks. My fathers friend and neighbor owned an art gallery/mineral shop that used to be a church. If you have ever driven through Start-up on your way from Sultan to Goldbar on highway 2 you might remember seeing the robot sculpture outside the shop that my dad built. This is the place that we sold the stone for $2 a pound. It was lucrative revenue for a pre-teen.

The walk from the creek where we harvested these rocks to the dirt road wasn't particularly long

When I was about 14 I distinctly remember hauling a backpack full of these rocks up from the creek to my dads truck. Along the way I ran into a man that looked to be about 30 years old. We both appeared to be surprised that we would run into anyone in this rather remote section of the mountains, as if he was seeing a ghost. He didn't say anything as I passed, he just stared at me seemingly trying figure out the appropriate words ask me something. After passing him I remember thinking how much this guy looked like he could be in my family, the similarities were striking. I continued on to the truck, dumped my load of rock off at the truck and headed back down to the river to my dad. When I arrived I told him about the encounter and asked him if he had seen this man to which he replied that he hadn't. I have remembered this encounter quite vividly since then.

Last year I was visiting my family in Snohomish and decided to head up to old Goblin Creek for nostalgic purposes. It had been about 15 years since I was last up there. Along the way up there I found out that the Index-Galeema road had apparently washed out years before, about 14 years old. He was wearing a backpack that looked to be burdened by heavy weights. As we got closer, I began to get increasingly confused and shocked as the boy looked exactly like I did at his age. I meant to say something to him as he passed, but could not figure out the right words to express what I was thinking at the moment. He passed me and kept going. I walked a little ways and finally stopped when it all really hit me. I remembered the encounter from my teenage years and realized I had just lived the other half of the experience! Both the man and boy were me, roughly 15 years removed! I turned around to catch up to the boy in the thick Western Washington woods. I ran all the way back up to the road where my truck was to find...... nothing. There wasn't anywhere else besides the road for him to go to, and I hadn't stalled so long as to not be able to catch up to him. He was simply gone. Curiosity got the best of me so I hurried down to the creek half expecting to find my dad fishing on the bank 15 years younger but found nobody.

I ended up going home and deciding that this experience was too unbelievable to tell even my friends and family. I just wanted to get this out there to the wonderful Reddit community to see what others think and hopefully to see if anyone else has had this type of experience as well.

It was about five years ago and I was browsing some old family photo albums with my mum that she had got down from the loft. I hadn't seen these particular albums before but I suddenly came across a photo which I remembered being taken. I started describing to mum my memories of that day.... all the intricate details about how my uncle laughed at my mum for putting the wrong number of candles on the birthday cake, etc. I was telling mum about how I remembered crying because no one paid attention to me that day - I could remember wandering around and crying and people were ignoring me. No one said a word to me or acknowledged that I was even there. My mum started getting really freaked out and then I realised why. She was quite heavily pregnant with me in the photo.

My mum claims that I described the events of that day with 100% accuracy. Apparently only her and my uncle were in the room when he corrected the number of candles on the cake and it was never mentioned to anyone. I'm not quite sure how or why I would have ever known about what happened. Still to this day I don't have an explanation.

In high school, so it generally took 3 or 4 class periods to finish a movie. I remember one time we watched a movie, a black and white one about a business executive and a shoe salesman, and a kidnapper who attempts to steal away the rich boy's child to ransom, but through some mishap takes the wrong boy.

The class watched the whole movie. I laid on the floor next to a boy I liked, I loved the class and it was the first time I watched a live action movie in Japanese, so I enjoyed it.

Fast forward a month or so, a story of kidnapping, shoe salesman and executive. I put my hand up when I realise and inform the class that we'd already watched that movie, and I start describing the plot to remind everyone. Everyone shushes me so that I don't spoil the movie - even the boy I shared toast with has no recollection. The teacher says he's never seen the movie before.

At a loss, except I sat at my desk this time. I had never had occasion to watch a Japanese film at home, I truly watched that movie twice, in that class - and everyone watched it with me, but everyone else forgot.

The street I'm on has a stop sign

As I sat there looking both ways before I turn right I notice that another Chevy Chevette (the make and model of the car I'm driving) is headed my way from the right. It's even the same color. I look left to make sure there's no oncoming traffic before I turn right

I glance at the driver as I start my turn and first notice that his mouth is hanging open in awe/shock. Odd. Then I notice that he's too is wearing glasses

My foot falls off the accelerator as he passes by my, cut of beard, balding hair pattern, pudgy overweight face, style of glasses, make and model and color of car. *Exactly* like me as now we both have this awe/shocked expression on our faces. There's this *connection* that passes between us as he's seeing himself in me, as I'm seeing myself in him.

But by this time I'm rolling out into the intersection! I grab a hold of what little composure I have left and complete the turn right, pull a u-turn. It's a small street so it's a three point turn. I drive, quickly, back to the intersection and turn left onto the street I just turned off from. I'd say not more than three minutes has passed. If that!

When I turn back onto the street there's no sign of this other vehicle. I continue down the street, but there's no sign of him. None! All the blocks are on straight, flat streets so it's not like he could have turned onto a side street then around a corner, or in a dip in the street, and disappeared out of sight. He's simply not there, not any where, to be found.

We get there in the early afternoon, some are making the beds ready and some are cleaning the living-room or shoveling snow on the porch. In other words, we weren't all in the same room at the same time for the first hour or two.

At around 19:00, cooking the meat and setting the table. Because we all had a few beers during the time at the cabin, people were constantly going to the outhouse. This meant that the first time we're all together in the same room for a good period of time was during dinner. 

When we ate, one with room for two, a chair plus two chairs from the kitchen. The seating arrangements made it possible for seven people to sit comfortably, without anyone having to use the middle seat in the three-seater. 

After the feast of cheese, where is...uh... Who sat there?"" pointing at the empty living room chair. ""Oh, that was....uh... I'm not sure."" one of the guys said. ""It was that guy from... uh."" My colleague answered.

We all swore that there were seven of us on the trip, and the number we came up with added up to six. At the same time, we had brought in the two chairs from the kitchen because there wasn't room enough in the living room, and we had said no to some people wanting to go on the trip because the cabin only had seven beds. 

We were quite sure that there were seven of us, we had bought enough food for seven people, had made seven beds and were damn sure that someone had been sitting in the empty seat. We had no recollection of this person, but all agreed it was a man, not a woman.

This happened during spring in the far north of Norway

There were several of those tall tube slides that are about 4 ft in diameter at the water park. The ride in question had two slides from one platform, (with the second parent still up top).

Apparently, and it turns out that the first parent says the kid never came out the bottom.

Some supervisor arrives and they hold the entire slide, etc. Everyone is a bit puzzled because if the kid was stuck in the slide, the second parent would have gone past him.

They end up having employees ride both slides down ""looking"" for the kid--or his wedged in the slide corpse. Both slides are clear. He's just gone.

Security and management is called in

Then someone radios in that they found a kid matching that description across the whole park

Now, and had to wear shoes. But apparently the kid was found barefoot in swim trunks.

I grew in a country that was in the middle of a prolonged civil war. We had the rebels fighting the government troops



We lived in a very nice neighbourhood in the capital city



One night, I heard a massive explosion. I see nothing but dust, and the walls disintegrating around me. I looked up and the roof was caving in. Everything was in slow motion, but at the same time it was just a fraction of a second and I didn't have time to react. The entire house was crumbling around me. I heard my mom screaming, then a wall fell on her. I was really freaking out.


Then, nothing, just a face. So I looked at him directly in his eyes, while the house was falling around me. I was calm now, and I knew I didn't have to worry.


Then


There I was watching TV with my mom like nothing had happened. The face disappeared too.


I asked my mom if she felt anything. She said no.


A few hours later


Later we learnt that the rebels had sent a message to the government telling them that the car bomb had exploded

A couple of friends and I decided to play tennis, there wasn't any so we decided open up a new can.

My friend uses pink Wilson tennis balls so that if the courts do happen to be full we can easily keep track of which ones are ours. These particular tennis ball cans had 3 balls per can. We start volleying and just hitting around since we both haven't played in a while and we were waiting on a possible one or two other friends to get there. Some time passes and only one of those extra people happens to show up so we decide to play some Canadian doubles. Since there are only 3 useable balls

Now here's where it got weird. After playing for a bit, the number on the ball is random and only used to distinguish them from the ones on the court next to you and now we have four of the exact same kind.

Is there a rational explanation? Possibly. We just found it perplexing how in a set of empty tennis courts in which we purposefully checked to see that there were no extra tennis balls

Okay the start of this happened a while ago but I didn't care enough to post about it because it didn't weird me out until recently. I can't remember when in the winter it took place but I remember what happened.

I had been playing the first temple run for iPhone while pooping and there was a fork coming up. I was set on making a right turn, my thumb, my arm, myself were all completely set on making that right, but when I get there, I went left instead. Like for some reason, faster than possible for changing my mind

When this happened

I think this is where I might have jumped because from here on things were different and straight up reversed in other instances.

In all situations I played it off as ""okay my mistake"" because I didn't feel like being awkward in person.

Immediately out the door I notice there's no bleach stain on the carpet outside the bathroom. Cool.

I get back downstairs and my parents are slightly more irritable with me specifically

I had been told all the way up till that day that black people swing left. Specific people and I had had that conversation multiple times. The next time it had come up

The weather in Ohio had never been this god damn turbulent ever. The joke ""it's Ohio"" had always stood, windy, and cloudy. Ohio was never like this. It was sunny almost year round but cold for a few weeks in winter with a decent amount of snow.

There used to be specific trees in my backyard that I played on as a kid and relaxed by when I wanted quiet and peace during the summer. They don't exist. Not like people tore it down in thirty minutes and replaced it with perfectly even grass. It doesn't exist anymore. It was apparently cut down ages ago.

My first instrument in band was clarinet. Everybody in my grade knew I played the god damn clarinet. I played it up to seventh grade before I started learning a ton of other instruments. In conversation no one knew I played clarinet.

I was best friends with this one girl. After this temple run poop event

Occasionally the same feeling of a moving wall of sparky spark comes back, skip up a moment, get a premonition and know something will happen before it happens, etc.

I used to hate squirrels

I've seen wolves here in Ohio

The air is different. It was never so heavy.

I used to play louder than everyone in band on my trombone-I attribute this to the sudden increase in ""weight"" of air to me

I have tons more examples. I'm confused

**TL:DR-PRETTY CERTAIN I'M NOT FROM HERE**

Edit: A ton of you told me to see a doctor/neurologist

It is important to say that there was a month and a half-long period of time a few months ago where insomnia symptoms spiked and I was going days

In general she said that it is likely that I haven't recovered as much as I had thought from the wicked insomnia

If heavy insomnia had been the cause of this ""new reality"" to me, and substituted other things. For example, I might have been aware of bleach spilling on the carpet near my bathroom, but we may have washed it out or something so that there was no stain. It is also possible that I had been super attached to the trees that were cut down as a kid, and after editing memories I could apparently ""remember"" sitting under my favorite trees recently. Apparently wolves always lived here. She says it is possible that everyone else forgot I played clarinet since I switched early and only play it at home. I had mentioned a difference in video games to someone else in the comments, I could have forgotten that things could be done. 

It isn't certain why the air felt heavy to me until I acclimatized. That is still iffy and weird.

The loss of my best friend could actually be my fault. Since I had been heavily disoriented

My parents being more irritable with me is also a weird one. It could be that I remember my kid years as being easier than now because I wasn't stressed with other things like AP classes and social shit going on around the time.

Black people swinging right instead of left was fucking awkward to talk about. She says I could have honestly misplaced words and switched directions.

Then going back to being general, a different universe? What happened to everyone I know? Who are these people?). 

She decided that seeing a neurologist shouldn't be necessary since this didn't affect my productivity, etc, and since it was fixing itself as well I should be good. It'll be watched to make sure I don't lapse or something.

Our relationship was on the rocks because of her addiction and we actually hadn’t spoken in a couple of months.  Still, or the current year.  She thought it was “1990-something.”  She was very out of it and couldn’t remember anyone she’d met after the 90s.  It was very bizarre-the things she was saying

I should add that prior to her ending up in the hospital, I had this incredibly realistic, vivid, and physical dream that I was giving birth.  In the dream, I felt like I was going to black out and I thought I was going to die and I was begging the doctors to make sure they gave my baby to my SO (for some reason I was afraid they wouldn’t and he/she would end up in foster care or something).  When I woke up, I was really shaken up by the dream.  

I visited my mom in the hospital every single day.  One day, “Oh so you’re pregnant.”  I said that no, I wasn’t.  I hadn’t gained a pound or anything so I had no idea where that came from, but I thought it was pretty strange considering my dream and the fact that I was still late.  She insisted that I was pregnant and even started telling the nurses that her daughter was pregnant.  I chalked it up to her brain injury.  Still, it freaked me out enough to take two more pregnancy tests over the course of the next few weeks.  Both were negative.  My mom started freaking me out-she would rub my belly and ask me about the baby.  No matter how many times I told her I wasn’t pregnant, she kept saying that I was and even started to get really agitated and emotional, asking

By the time my mom was getting out of the hospital, and it came up positive.  When I went to pick my mom up, she had probably about 75% of her brain function back.  I told her she was right, that I was pregnant.  She just said, “Yeah, I know.”  When I asked how she knew, she just said

Then, I saw a boy.  Even though I wished for a girl, part of me just knew it was a boy.  Turns out my subconscious was right-he’s a boy (and I’m very happy about that!)   The dream seemed to be some sort of weird foreshadowing too, because I ended up being very ill and needed to be induced a little over 3 weeks early.  The medicine they had me on made it difficult for me to keep my eyes open, and when I did open them, I saw double.  I felt like I was going to black out.  I told my SO that if I died to please be good to our son and to tell him how much I loved him.  After I gave birth, I couldn’t even stand up without vomiting and blacking out because I lost a lot of blood.  It felt exactly like in the dream.

I’m not sure if my mom even remembers this as she says she doesn’t remember much of what happened in the hospital.  Both her knowing and my weird dream still freak me out a bit.

So back when I was in high school, but it was a cheaper model, no user-changeable faceplate, and it was a Tracfone per-paid deal. I think it had a Nimh battery or some other technology because the instruction manual said that it had to be ""deep discharged"" every so often, which consisted of running the battery all the way down to zero power and then charging it back up to full. 

So I was doing his deep discharge thing one night and i get the battery run down, and I hear a woman pick up and say, ""Hello?"" Of course I say nothing, but just then a man says, ""oh hey! It's me!"" and they start having a conversation about nothing in particular, just catching up with each other it seems.

1368621615.0,1ednl0,I had a key to a room before the room existed,pantyhosepuppet,197,29,30,"A bit of backstory: I'm a hoarder and I collect random things. I particularly love little shiny rocks, and other older relatives, that kind of thing. In my senior year of high school I decided to conclusively quit this habit; I remember this because my boyfriend at the time bought me a beautiful jar to display all my little trinkets in. The year after that I moved out to go to university and didn't even unpack the jar for almost a year. When I did unpack it it was still sealed with a cork and I displayed it on my bookshelf but never added to it again - it became just a cute anecdote about my childhood.

In my junior year of university, like how most keys only have one bumpy thing you stick in the keyhole, this one had two parallel ones on the same key.) I went home and found the other key, which was about halfway down the jar and near the outside (i.e. it's very unlikely I added it after I put everything in the jar in high school). I didn't remember when or where I'd gotten the key. To my disappointment, it didn't open the professor's office, and I concluded that despite looking similar it must be a different key. Still, I decided to start carrying the second key around, I became vaguely aware that the key had the initials ""IS"" written in whiteout on the top bit (like the bit you hold.)

At my university, this unit enrols exactly five students, who each gets given a key to this room. In the second semester of my junior year, one of my closest friends, let's call him Jake, was doing this unit. One day Jake asked to borrow a pen and I told him to rifle through my purse; he asked ""why do you have a key to the IS room?"" and I replied something like ""I don't know, I have a lot of keys?"" and then we quickly became distracted by something else. (He knew about my collection of keys and I guess I assumed he was asking about one of those. My recollection of this bit is fuzzy, at the time I did not attach significance to it.)

Fast forward to the end of semester. It's Friday. I am on campus despite not having class on a Friday because I was at the library and decided to hang around waiting for a guy I like to finish class so we could have coffee. (Strangely

As Jake gets closer I realise he looks veeeery stressed. He walks right up to me and says 'holy shit - you have an IS key don't you?' It took me a beat but somehow in that moment I just knew exactly what he was referring to - I know that sounds corny, which I pull out of my bag and hand to him. He says 'thank god, I *will* explain later' and just runs off.

I later find out that he'd locked all of his belongings in the IS room and was already running late for the interview. All of the documents he needed for the interview were in that room. If he hadn't run into me or someone else with a key, again, not many people had class on Fridays.

Needless to say

But here's the bit that makes it a glitch: this building we're talking about was only built in my sophomore year. I stopped collecting keys in high school. I am absolutely sure about the timeline here because all of the marketing material for the faculty from my senior year reference the fact that they were going to move the whole faculty to this new building. And again

I have two possible non-glitch explanations for this:
1. Maybe I am misremembering some fact, to the extent that I more or less remember the last five keys I added to the collection, because they were all very unique/interesting and I wasn't just collecting them for the sake of it.
2. Maybe the key opened the original Independent Study Room in the old building and they simply used the exact same lock here, because I'm pretty sure the building was in its skeletal form when I visited the campus for the first time at the end of high school.

My glitch-in-the-matrix explanation for this is that it was *so vital* to the universe that Jake get this job, maybe this job helps him become a world famous person in his field or cure cancer or something. Why the universe couldn't have done this by simply not letting him lock himself out of the IS room, I have no idea.

**tl;dr found a key in high school that opens the door of a room in a building that didn't get built until my sophomore year of college

I posted this with a sock because my main account is fairly active in my university's reddit group and i didn't want people to ask me about it on campus. Some facts changed, it's a lucky coincidence that his friend happens to have a key to this room and was on campus that day. Typing it out like that, without more, it does actually seem like an almost boring coincidence.

A few weeks back, so I go to the website and fill out my info. They didn't need a CC number or anything so I figured I had nothing to lose. The order goes through, I then had to confirm my ID, which I did, and everything seemed normal. 

I went back to the reddit post I had originally seen this deal on, my order worked just fine and I'm in Montreal. To make sure, I went to the Panda site, where you can livechat with customer service. I ask the person if I'll recieve my ecig, and she tells me that unfourtunately, I would not, as the offer is indeed not valid in Canada. Oh well, but whatever. I didn't think much about it after that.

Fast forward to yesterday. I got home from work, a package was waiting for me. I opened it up to find an electronic cigarette from panda! Cool, I thought. Surprises are great and so is free shit. Can't complain!

I proceed to get in the house and sit on the couch to try out my new nicotine delivery device. I take a few drags, and then I tell her my minor success story about the ecig. I go to pick it up on the end table - it's gone. Thing is, my friend saw it there too. We then spend the next hour searching EVERYWHERE for the stupid thing, it was driving us nuts. My house is really small and I'm a pretty neat person in general. I have no idea what happened to that electronic cigarette. It just... vanished.

Suddenly, as soon as I heard the knock it creeped me out a bit. It was a strange repeating pattern of two knocks then a pause; one-two stop, one-two stop. Mike didn't seem scared by it at all, and yelled for whoever it was to come in. No answer. The knock continued and he must have decided it was his younger brother (let's call him ""John""). He and his brother were always messing with each other, and he got annoyed pretty quickly. He yelled for John to stop because we were trying to play, and when the knock didn't stop he paused the game and ran to the door. He yelled something about how he was going to beat the shit out of John, and we could hear footsteps running away from the door to John's room down the hall.          
As soon as he threw open the door, we assumed he had gone under the bed or in the closet. After searching the room pretty thoroughly, we simultaneously looked at each other and I felt a wave of fear grip my chest. It was so strange and we had no explanation for what had just happened. The noises were somewhat explainable, but the door slamming like that (not just shutting, slamming) really scared us.           
We left the game on and stayed downstairs until his brother and parents eventually got home. We didn't tell them what had happened, business as usual. The night passed without anything else weird happening.

I was in my early twenties, a 15 minute walk.

When we returned: http://imgur.com/Ja0cLI1**

(The following story is completely and utterly true. Just felt I should point that out

I'm British and have lived in the USA for about 5 years. My family moved due to my father's work, as I wasn't all that interested in going in the first place.

It was dull, I was 15 and she was 12 at the time. We were walking along one of the pathways through the theme park and there was no one around, there were very few people there that day, I assume due to the weather.

We came across one of the usual signs for the rides, have a heart condition, etc. I can't for the life of me remember what the ride was called, but the sign was older than the others, and branches had grown over it and made it harder to notice. It did however inform us that the ride was in fact a maze. The entrance to the maze was hard to find also, despite the sign. It was a doorway of black wood coming out of the side of what looked like a mound of earth covered in foliage and trees.

Upon going in, and crappy decor. It was meant to be some sort of horror fun house, with trick mirrors that reveal a face that isn't yours if you get close enough, and low ceilings to make you crouch and in some parts crawl.

The whole point of the maze was to find your way to one of two slides and get out, and I'm not usually one to freak out over dim lighting and shitty, home made Halloween decorations. But something just made both of us feel really uncomfortable, and we both wanted to get out as soon as possible. We made our way through the largest room, that was rather disturbingly decorated with false severed body parts and jarred ""organs"". I remember thinking that it was a little much for a kiddie theme park.

We came across what we believed to be the way out: a giant badly sculpted monster, my little sister insisted, more obviously afraid than I. It was as cramped and dark as I had expected when I got through, though at least I could stand up. Immediately after the monster, we had to climb some stairs and found ourselves in a weird little plastic room, wet with rain that had leaked in. Sure enough, one of the slide entrances was there, it was boarded up.

My sister and I practically chased one another back down the pitch black staircase and back out the monster's mouth. There was only one more direction to try and we eventually found our way out the other slide. The exit was as nondescript as the entrance

She and I made our way back to my families chosen meeting point, and we couldn't find the ride. The theme park wasn't very big, and so this map showed the location of literally everything. Although a little creeped out, it again didn't seem like a big deal. The maze was older, maybe the map had be updated. We weren't far away, and my youngest sister wanted to head that way anyway, so we decided to show my mum the maze.

We we definitely back where the ride was, neither was the entrance. We ran down the pathway, trying to find the exit, but it wasn't there either. Everything else was exactly as it had been, but the ride and every trace of it was gone.

Neither of us have an explanation, and my sister and I going off for that amount of time.

This began last night. My boyfriend and I keep our bedroom door shut, and the hallway light was on, but the door was shut. I woke up again later, and the door was slightly ajar and the hallway light was still on. This morning, the door was shut, and I had to turn the hallway light off. I asked my boyfriend if he got up during the night, but he said no. Okay, maybe he just doesn't remember.

Then I went downstairs to feed the cats. Something had spilled in the fridge, and I opened and closed the fridge door twice, trying to find the dripping. I knelt down and checked the very bottom of the fridge. Nothing was spilled anywhere. When I turned back around, my cat was playing with toilet paper, and there was toilet paper all over the floor that had not been there a few minutes before. My trash can has a lid, so the cat could not have pulled that out. Not only that, but I use toilet paper folded into little squares to put toner on my face after I wash it - this is what the cat was playing with, far away from the kitchen. The trash can upstairs also has a lid

When I bent down to pick up all the scraps off the floor, and I was amazed by how quiet he was, because he is a really big dude. I was planning on telling him his cat was being an asshole once he got back from the basement - but then I heard him walking around *upstairs*, and he came down into the kitchen... he hadn't ever gone into the basement.

Meanwhile, the passenger side window was rolled half-way down. I never leave my windows down, because I live in a really crappy neighborhood. It rained overnight (one of the times that I looked at the bedroom door overnight, it was because the storm woke me up), so everything outside was wet, and I was concerned that my passenger seat would be soaked. *Nothing in my car was wet.* My cd cases were sitting on the passenger seat, and both the cases and the seat were bone dry.

So then, and I was getting frustrated because the truck in front of me was pulling a big, metal trailer with really dim brake lights - and he was going sooo slow. The trailer was full of trash, and in spray paint it said, ""STAY BACK 15 FEET"" across the back, in really poor handwriting. I was relieved when the truck &amp; trailer got off at the next exit - which I should mention is a left exit that dumps out onto a trafficway that travels away from the highway (not parallel, nor do they intersect again) I finally sped up, about 5 miles down the road... I passed the same damn truck. Same crappy handwriting across the back

One night, just for fun.

Now
We've lived in this town for years, this town is near impossible to get lost in. It's set up like a giant grid. (streets labeled with numbers and direction, i.e.  NW 8th st., SE 15th ave et cetera) So even if you had no natural sense of direction whatsoever, you could get around town just by paying attention to the signs.

We had been biking in one direction for a while

Well, but this uneasy feeling came over me as my friend started to mention how we seem to have gone a wrong way- which he had never said before in this town. 

After quite a time of riding back in the direction of home (we were CERTAIN we were going the right way based on the signs) we come to a main road

When we arrived back home we both felt extremely perplexed and uneasy. I realize we could have just been confused, but it made for a great adventure!

It's weird. It's disturbing. I don't like it at all. It could be a coincidence... I hope it is.

This morning, so I clicked it because I was curious.

Instead of going to our sister-in-law's page, and not to fear the death of the body.

And I was reading this message,"" she said, ""I am checking into a mental hospital tomorrow morning.  If my husband will let me.  If he does not let me, then you were right about him all along.  I love you.""

I ran out of the room to call her

Talked to her a bit.  She wasn't making a whole lot of sense.  I asked if I should call 911 to come help her, not from either him or her), he took her to the hospital while her husband was sleeping.  Not believing it until I hear from him.

**TL;DR** Glitch in the matrix led me to what looked an awful lot like a suicide note coming up in real-time.  I hope I did the right thing.

Edit:  She has had some issues with her mental stability in the past -- I'm fairly sure it's bipolar disorder.  A likely explanation doesn't make it any less terrifying

Edit 2: Frontpage?  Really?

About 3:00 PM, but it was good to hear it from him.  He didn't call sooner because he wasn't allowed to take his phone in with him.  He said that on the way there, she was spouting the same stuff she'd been saying to me, to our mom, and apparently to her husband.  And she tried to run away from him in the parking garage because he'd said he wasn't sure how to get to the hospital from there (it isn't attached), so I guess that sent up red flags that he couldn't be trusted after all.  Eventually she must have calmed down.  She signed herself in, so at least she was stable enough to do that.  Now I suppose we just hope she's getting help and wait patiently for news.

I asked if he wanted to go on a walk with me because I was feeling too stuffy in the house with no A/C. It was getting close to sunset

Well, and I had no idea what was going on. It felt as if I was in a super lucid dream but was not able to wake up. Really it just felt like I did not exist and nothing else existed. It's so weird to think about and very difficult to explain. 
I was so weirded out by this that I asked my boyfriend if I was dreaming

We continued on our walk for another 20 minutes. The feeling never went away. I tried to focus on the scenery around me to see if anything was unrealistic. Everything was in the right place

Eventually we got home and I had to lie down and relax. I ended up forgetting about it after I slept for a little while. Still

It was a week day and I drove to my physio appointment in the morning in my '01 Camry. My appointment finished an hour later and I drive home. On the way home however, park the car in my garage and go inside. My girlfriend is inside

Skip ahead 3 weeks.

I open up the mailbox, but not two. I open up the first one, it's a speeding fine, $75, 9km/h over the speed limit, day and date, etc. Except, is clearly a picture of my girlfriend driving my car. However, so at first I thought it was strange

I open up the other envelope, it's me, in my car, yep everything checks out. I look at the details - $75, 9km/h over the speed limit. However, I look at the date, and it's the same date as the one on my girlfriends speeding fine. I look at the time, got her to double check the times and details. I reference the date and time with her diary, fine

She says she has never driven my car before in the 2 years we have known each other, and it must've been some issue with the camera, but I had no case. I just ended up paying for both fines and continuing on with my life. To this day, I don't know what happened. My girlfriend was at home waiting for me on the day I was caught by the camera speeding. There is a 0% chance that it was her driving my car. All the evidence proves it though, that she somehow drove my car, and went passed the same speed camera, on the same day, doing the same speed

**tl;dr: I got a speeding fine. Girlfriend got the same speeding fine, at the same speed, in the same location, 24 seconds after I did, while she was at home watching the Kardashians.**


EDIT: You guys convinced me! I'm going to give the post office/my local police station a visit this week to see if I can get a copy of it.

My brother and I are avid golfers and took a day-trip to a golf course 45 minutes away to another town. On the way home there is a town (5 minutes out from our city) with a new development and a golf course that was slated to open last season but was delayed for a year to establish the seed more thoroughly. 

I piped up and said ""let's go check out the new course and see what it looks like."" So we meander through some unfamiliar new suburbish type crescents (as they are called in our parts) to get to this new golf course. 

Amidst conversation and an unfamiliar route we turn down a crescent that appears to be a dead end or loop. We see an old man walking down his driveway to unlock his car (presumably to get in and drive)

Now we are still conversing about which way we should go and I absentmindedly turn down the same crescent we just were on

I did not travel in time

For many years after

I get married, no children. The idea seems more and more unlikely as the years add up. When I do recall my experience, I pass it off as a vivid dream, as it seems less and likely I will have kids, rendering it moot.

Then, we realize if we are going to have kids, it needs to be now, or else the bioligical clock will have run down. We change our diets, we lose weight. My wife starts doing cardio. In late april, Aunt Flo is late, and finally

We go into the doctor several weeks later, and they will invent time travel. My baby has to be healthy for this to occur. So when I worry, I think back to my experience when I was 12. My baby is gonna be fine.

So why am I telling a bunch of random redditors this? Well, but if it does, I am hedging my bets. More people knowing, believing, repeating it, can only help if it does.

And 25 years later, and him/her repeating the message down my lineage, till one of them comes back and visits me when I was 12, and closes the loop. 

TL;DR; crusoe is part of a causality loop that eventually results in the invention of time travel. His first child is the next link in that chain.

- Lied to 3rd grade classmates that my dad was friends with a ""famous"" person

- Told friend I was getting a new tattoo over xmas break, had another friend offer to buy me one as a xmas gift (on a whim, her idea), got tattoo.

- Applied for a PA job with a friend on feature film shooting in my hometown in MS (of which I now live 7 hours away from in a different state). Never heard back, ended up home visting my mom, got a call from an out-of-state sound department friend looking for help on that same feature.

In late 2012 I had a nightmare (which in itself was weird for me because I only have a vivid dream every few years) it was my older sister screaming in my face except no sound was coming out. It was just her making an unrealistically large scream face 2 inches from my face and I was just standing there. I didn't recognize where I was or who the people were around me and why they weren't helping. I tried to play cool in the dream and not react but I remember losing my calm facial expression for a split second and then worrying that she noticed my fear. Then she finally screamed

Last month my sister bought a house with her boyfriend (now fiancée) and during the house-warming party I was walking around the house giving myself the tour when on my way back to the crowd in the kitchen my sister jumped around a corner and did the same screaming face I remembered from my dream accompanied by a puny yell. I just looked at her confused as she said ""WHAT?! THAT DIDN'T SCARE YOU?!"". I looked around and realized that this was the place I saw in the dream

I never said anything to her and just laughed it off but to this day it still makes me uncomfortable knowing that the only dream I've had in the last 3ish years was a vivid scene of an exact scenario I would later experience in real life. 

And this wasn't even the first time I've had a dream like this involving my sister. Even crazier

**EDIT:** I don't know if I can bring up the dream to my sister. I think it would just be awkward and I'd end up looking like a crazy person. Even if I did ask her there's a possibility her dream was completely different and unrelated or she might have even forgot saying she'd had one before since she was around my age when she said that which means it was at least 6 years ago. Even if she did remember and she helped me understand what the hell my dream was all about it might just end up scaring her and that isn't any good. Anyway

I'm sorry to cop out but I'd rather just keep this as something interesting to think about and not investigate it too much. I'd love to know what happened and if her story is the same type of thing but I think we're both too old to be talking about our dreams predicting the future haha.

At this time, and we have made this trip MANY times before (we would head up there several times each year, and my family spent every summer up there in my childhood since we had a lake house on Platte Lake).

My friend and I left home at 3am so we could get some early morning fly fishing in when we arrived.  Somewhere around 2/3 of the way through the trip (we were on M115 just north of Cadillac) everything started seeming unnaturally calm out on the road (The road is in the middle of a national forest so things are calm as is.  This was a very eerie calm).  We did not notice anything else.  The sun was just peeking over the horizon

The next thing we both knew is we were coming up to the us-31 intersection in Benzonia.  I glanced at the clock, and it too said 12:30pm; so did the sign at a bank.  

My friend and I found ourselves VERY confused.  It is hard to explain the feeling.  It was like WTF?!?!

We should have arrived in town around 6-6:30am and instead we arrived six hours later than expected.

We were not tired during the trip (got lots of sleep the day before, so i am used to long distance trips).  We were also both totally familiar with the route.

The gas tank in the vehicle was still fairly full and it would have been empty if we randomly drove around in a daze the whole time.  We checked our credit card statements later that month and there were no gas purchases during the lost time.  The mileage on the truck seemed normal for that trip.

The strange thing is, the trip seemed like a normal amount of time for that drive, but the clocks said differently.

It was just a total mindfuck.

It has happened several more times over the years to lesser extents.   Anyone have any clue into wtf happened?

1367361280.0,1dfxfy,I lived in a glitch house.,thesistergeek,130,21,23,"**BACKGROUND**

I swear to you all of this is true, I gotta tell this story to somebody.  I still have nightmares about it five years later.

I've been lurking around here for a while, and I was back then.  I did everything I could to disprove what happened in that house, but I came up with nothing, time after time.  I don't talk often about what happened there.  My fiance knows some of it, no one knows all of it. 

I firmly believe it wasn't ghosts or anything.  The house wasn't on an indian burial ground

**THE HOUSE**

It was really super suburban, but it was a good house overall.  He decided to rent the house and find something smaller for reasons that were never made clear.  My dad only met him once.  It was only about a year old when we moved in.  We only had a 6 month lease, and I was a senior in high school.  Apparently it was a REALLY good deal.

**THE FIRST TIME**

The first night we moved in was the first time something happened.  The first time was to my brother, I assumed he'd locked himself out.  His story was different.

He'd fallen asleep in his new bed, but he couldn't get into his room, so I figured he'd locked himself out.

But the doorknob turned.  It was more like something heavy was on the other side of the door.  I pushed hard and it gave way, it had to be done from the inside.  My brother would have had to have jumped out of a 2nd story window into thorn bushes to get out of his window, and we didn't have a ladder that tall.

I let him sleep in my room that night.  Not that we really slept.  Our parents didn't believe us.

**SMALL THINGS**

After that, and he decided to install a metric fuck ton of outlets in it.  In my 8'x8' room alone, there were six.  My brother's, slightly bigger, had five.  The living room had eight.  I'd never seen anything quite like it.

I'd be home alone

It wasn't uncommon for any of us to take a nap

Sometimes the rooms would ""reset"" as I called it.  It happened about once a month, and return to it looking exactly like it had before.  Like I'd never even touched it.  Chip bags crinkled in the same way and place, plates with the same food on it.  One time a sandwich reappeared, after I'd already eaten it.  It always reset by about 6 hours.  It made me question reality in all sorts of ways.

**THE BIG ONE**

I've skipped over some of them

In the perfect cliche, and I turned around.

From my front door, you *have* to pass through the dining room, which I could clearly see.

The sound was coming from my brother, his feel together and arms straight at his side.  He was staring at a spot above the fireplace that held nothing in particular, and was wearing a red tshirt with grey and yellow long athletic pants and no shoes.

I called out his name three times, stop fucking with me.  What are you doing?""  That nickname always got a rise out of him.  But he kept standing there.  It was probably only about a minute, but it felt like an hour.  Suddenly, he turned on his heel and walked way faster than normal toward the dining room.  The only thought I had at that moment was that that wasn't how my brother walked.  I was completely terrified.

Fighting every horror movie instinct, he wasn't there.  I would have to have seen him.

I jumped 10ft in the air when I heard, and had his arms laden with mountain dew and chips.  The microwave had started only a few minutes prior, which he would have had to been in the kitchen to start.  It hadn't been him.  And my brother was wearing the same clothes as the version of him I saw.  A red tshirt with grey and yellow long athletic pants and no shoes.  I told him what I saw.  He told me that he saw me standing in the living room a few seconds before I ran in the room, but that I was wearing jeans.

I want to say that we then investigated what just happened.  But we both noped out pretty hard

**THE END**

Unbeknownst to me, and decides to break it off with me, leaving me completely heartbroken. Fast forward a bit of time, and my friend and I are still not on good terms; looking at her made me so angry.

One day, spiteful comment in my direction. I just about go ape shit, push her over, and start strangling her. I held her neck in my right hand, squeezing, and lifted my left hand for a left hook, and swung. 

Right as the punch was about to connect, and coddled my hand. My eyes adjusted to the darkness, and I realize I was in my room. I looked at my clock, and it was the night before. ""Was that all a dream?"" I slowly nodded off to sleep.

The next day, at lunch, and my ex friend turns and makes a snide spiteful comment in my direction. I just about go ape shit, push her over, and start strangling her. I lifted my left arm for a hook, but then, my mind flashed. I remembered the previous night. I'd been here before... ""Was it all a dream?""

I just discovered this subreddit today

Back in 4th grade, so we had PE in the gym and one teacher taught the rest of the subjects in another classroom. 

So anyway, so we had a substitute teacher that day. Before we headed off to lunch which was at 11:30, I remember getting up to ask my teacher if I could use the restroom. However, on my walk up to her desk, I remember looking at the clock and checking the time (we had to write what time we ""checked out"") as well as kneeling to tie my shoelaces. After doing so, I went up to her, checked out at 11:17 AM, coming back at 11:22 AM.

After lunch, even though school was going to end at 3:00, which was not too far away. However, we were only allowed to go once a day unless it was an emergency (we had like 2 emergency passes) so I got up to go check out again, hoping to use my last emergency pass. However, half way up to the desk, I checked the time on the clock.

It said 11:17 AM.

The next thing I know

Afterwards, because she usually remembers who has gone and who hasn't and if you already had, she would always ask for an emergency pass, so I quickly went to the log book to see if I had gone at 11:17. However, it had no trace of me saying I had left to use the restroom at that time.

I left for the restroom, I was about as confused as a 4th grader can be. I walked up to the desk to sign back in, and surprisingly, it showed that I signed out at 2:47 EP (EP for emergency pass). 

To this day, so the event is still a bit hazy to me. But reading some of these stories brought up this memory. I'm not really sure about theories, but there is certainly something about the pattern in the timing of events: I left for the restroom 13 minutes before a transitional period (i.e. lunch, school ending), and came back both times 8 minutes before a transitional period. I'm totally up for theories though.

Here is one reason:

http://www.reddit.com/r/Glitch_in_the_Matrix/comments/14uyg9/a_house_saved_my_life/c7gv0r5?context=3

And I will also elaborate a bit more...

The original theory was a thought experiment and was reliant upon a quantum state of a particle. So even if you ignore the above reasons for quantum suicide being invalid then you're still ignoring a very important point

If we take an example of 'dying' in a car accident

To explain...

Cars, and the individual neurons in the brain of each person are all macroscopic objects. This means they are all visible and measurable via direct optical means. Quantum states do *not* apply to the macroscopic scale, only the microscopic (individual particle) scale.

So *even if* you believed in quantum suicide/immortality (and let me please stress the word 'believe')

So essentially, please, please* don't use the term 'quantum suicide' because it is *not* the same thing, and there is nothing 'quantum' about that belief. People love scientific terms and feel that they have a real explanation for something when scientific terms are used, but this term is being abused and totally misunderstood on this subreddit.

I love this subreddit, though, and not misused science. Wouldn't it be amazing if we had a glitch with loads of evidence that couldn't be explained away by known science?

We don't really look alike.  He's shorter and more heavyset than me and he's ghost white whereas I have an olive skin tone.  He's very messy and unorganized

Despite these differences

This happens more often than I'd like

I had just got home from taking an exam and I was laying in my bed in our apartment; just laying there thinking.  I started feeling odd.  I was fully conscious and sober

I tried picturing him in my mind but I found that I couldn't.  I couldn't for the life of me remember what he looked like.  I was searching my mind and I could not remember his face.  It was bugging me pretty badly


I sat down on the couch and I looked at him.  He was sitting five feet away in an armchair.  He was looking down at his laptop

I asked him how he was doing and he didn't respond.  I asked a second time (prolly sounding freaked out)

It was almost like I could sense the words about to come out of his mouth.

He looked down and kept typing.  I tried looking away from his face

This was too much for me.  I went back to my room and laid down.  I didn't want to deal with the kind of thoughts going through my head; I just wanted to go to sleep and hopefully forget it all happened.  

I was listening to music to get my mind off it all but I couldn't sleep.  I went back into the living room and everything was fine.  My brother was sitting there, and then put on a movie.  Everything was back to normal.

One day my friend and I were in a heavily populated mall-type area at Dundas Square in downtown Toronto (the building with the AMC and Future Shop in it, quite well. As you walk into the building, the ground floor is the ticket booth for the AMC (which is actually on the top floor of the building) and the elevators. There are two escalators leading up to the second floor, one going up and one going down. The second floor is a Future Shop. Right beside the first set of escalators were (past tense is key here) another set of two, one up and one down. The third floor is a food court. 

My friend and I get to the top of the second set of escalators onto the third floor food court, we walk toward the escalators and notice something odd - there is only one escalator, the one going up to the food court. The down escalator simply was not there. We stood there, completely dumbfounded. 

So we tried to logically work out the situation, two women approached us.

""Looking for the down escalator?"" 
""Yeah
""No. It's on the other side of the food court there--"" and one of the women pointed to the other side of the food court
""Yes
(This part blew our minds even more)
""No, and never was.""

My friend and I then went across the food court to get downstairs, but it still weirds me out to this day.

Back in 2009 my grandfather was diagnosed with lung cancer. The doctors believed since the cancer was caught earlier on my grandfather's chances of beating this horrid malady were quite favorable. Such was not the case

On March 3, I wrapped up my visit, told my grandfather good night and that I'd be back to see him tomorrow. As soon as I stepped out the door I was overcome with the feeling that that would be the last time I saw him. I tried to shake the feeling off as a reaction to the terrible news my grandmother had delivered right before I left, but by the time I reached the elevator the sensation that I had to go back and see him one last time was so unbearably strong I couldn't ignore it. Running back down the hall to his room, sobbing like some hysterical lunatic, I threw my arms around him and told him I loved him. After awhile, I said my goodbyes and again made another (this time successful) attempt to leave

After such a trying day, or if the noise was a more profound signal, but this was what caused me to awaken. As soon as I sat up and shook the grogginess away, I knew in that moment my grandfather had made his exit from this earthly plain. I grabbed my cell phone and looked at the time. . . 5:03 AM. I laid awake for several minutes before drifting back to sleep.

1363727227.0,1am9en,Creepy Glitches,thelovemuscle,113,19,27,"Bear with me if you can. This will be a long post. I've been keeping this one to myself for several years. This happened to my best friend

I will be including some drawings throughout this story

My friend, as their mother was out of town. They slept in the basement, which to my understanding was a basic finished basement with a bedroom off of it. The bedroom belonged to the babysitter's son, who was in his mid teens. Dean was 6, his brother Hank was older, about 8. The boys were sleeping in front of the television in their sleeping bags. 

[THIS](http://i.imgur.com/HlDXKFS.jpg) is the layout of the room. Dean is the red X, to the babysitter's son's room. Two windows to the backyard. Television, couch ect. 

Dean wakes up in the middle of the night, but he was used to a mild amount of light shining through the windows, even at night. He called to his brother, ""Hank? Are you awake?"". Hank answers, ""Yeah. And I can't see anything. Are your eyes stuck?"" Dean then realizes that he physically has his eyes shut, and that he can't pry them open. They both tug at their eyes with no success. ""Hank, where are you?"", let's feel around till we find eachother."" The boys both feel around

The moment they touch each other, I thought you were right next to me. I was at the couch."" They begin to feel around again. At this point, Dean determined they had both ended up [HERE](http://i.imgur.com/EyQCpyL.jpg).

They crawl around and feel for each other until they both near the same corner of the room. Again, they both begin to yell for the babysitter's son, Greg, who was asleep in his bedroom. They yell, but he doesn't come, so they repeat the process of shuffling and searching for each other. They find each other again, though he doesn't recall where. With one more touch

Dean feels along the wall and realizes he's towards the bottom of the stairs. ""Hank

Dean now knows he's [HERE](http://i.imgur.com/B2Tbtev.jpg) but he doesn't know where Hank is. Panicked

Greg opens his bedroom door, he tries to explain what has been happening. Greg dismisses it as a bad dream, but asks where Hank is. ""Here! I'm over here."", Hank calls out. Greg follows Hank's voice. 

Greg found Hank [HERE](http://i.imgur.com/gviReMp.jpg), especially in the dark, and I'm not sure if he could have even done it on his own. After trying to calm the boys down, and dismissing the events as just ""boys being boys and playing around"", Greg put the boys back to bed. They finally manage to fall asleep. 

Morning comes and things feel normal. The babysitter calls the boys up for breakfast as Dean remembers what happened that night. ""I had a really weird dream last night."", Dean notices the broken photo, lying in pieces on the floor. 

From what I was told, as me and two nearly grown men are almost in tears hearing it. I have neither a rational nor an irrational explanation for what happened, but I definitely still think about it from time to time. Thanks to anyone who read through this, and I'm sorry if it belongs in nosleep instead. I'll answer any questions that I can. 

**TLDR****; Friend and his brother were temporarily blinded by an unknown force and transported to different parts of the room every time they touched.** (admittedly bad TLDR)

1373465288.0,1i0a7q,The time I was executed.,alive41stime,131,34,44,"About 10 years ago I took a bus trip to Boston to visit a high school friend named Bill. We ended up going to Worchester

When I took the bus to Boston, we had 20 minutes to eat and I stupidly decided to stay in the bus instead of rushing around the city for a slice of pizza. I think it was the sleep-deprivation.

By the time I arrived in Worchester and ate my pile of mushrooms, we immediately ordered chinese, but I stupidly ate the mushrooms first. 

After about 15 minutes I could feel them. And I was a mushroom-veteran so I knew this was unheard of. I had tripped on mushrooms maybe 20 times in my life before that night.

The first thing that happened was Bill freaked out. I gave him the second biggest pile and after eating them he informed me that he had never tripped and had only smoked weed once or twice. I immediately realized I was going to have to watch his back.

About 2 hours in, I got the weirdest sense of dread. I cannot explain it in words, but it literally felt like death had entered the room.

I went to my friend Bill and told him we should go hang out in his car and listen to music. He was on another planet entirely and kept resisting. I was trying to explain to him that something sinister was afoot and he just didn't seem to get it. I ended up trying to grab his keys and he really got paranoid after that about letting me close to him. I ended up basically saying ""Every man for himself then"" and grabbing my stuff to exit the apartment.

When I gathered my stuff the others wanted to know what the hell I was doing. I just kept slowly backing towards the exit while making confusing small talk about getting fresh air. They asked why I had grabbed my backpack if I was just going out for a minute. I bolted.

One of my friends actually ran after me and caught me in the hallway. I was pressing the elevator button and they were staring at me from the doorway asking what the hell was wrong with me. I can't tell you why but I knew I had to get the fuck out of there. So I immediately bolted from my friend down the steps. 

I don't know whether he chased me or if it was the mushrooms

I ended up asking a couple girls to use their cellphone and things went bad somehow and these two guys started chasing me to kick my ass. So I began to run again thinking the whole world was out to get me. I was running recklessly in any direction and ended up in the ghetto. It was bad

I ran over to an all night parking lot and begged the guy inside to let me use the phone

I ended up getting put into the back of the cop car and this is where the things took a seriously dark turn. The police began to talk about the fact that I was a stain to society. They began to drive outside of the city and I was really freaking out because we were now in a suburban/rural area. The police were getting angrier and angrier throughout their conversation about ""lowlifes"" and ended up making some kind of weird agreement. It is important to note that I was completely calm and cooperated fully the moment the cops showed up.

The pulled onto a dirt road and drove deep into a forested area, I could feel the steel on my temple and then the man pulled the trigger. 

I was dead. Experiencing the 3rd party view of my body slumped against a tree.

I distinctly remember thinking ""Wow, I am in my spirit form, a God/afterlife does exist.""

And then I was in a magical forest of some kind. And then I was in the desert. And then I was in another environment. I was just flashing through landscapes

I remember seeing a waterfall and actually reaching out to see if I was hallucinating/dreaming or if I could ""feel"" the water. I felt the liquid running all over my (hand?).

Then I was suddenly awake. I was in a hospital. I had literally torn an IV tube and water was running all over my hand.

The nurses were nice and said I was one of the best patients they had. I was apparently brought by police into a ""calm down"" room because the police also agreed that I was just a good kid who took too many mushrooms. That is what the nurses told me. It was weird because I mentioned the parking lot and they told me ""No

To this day I do not know if:

* I completely hallucinated my death

* Two cops decided to fuck with me and actually pretended to kill me before dropping me off at a hospital

* It all really happened like I remember it and I experienced a glitch

I answered the phone and immediately said, ""Mom! Are you alright?!"" My mom quickly responded, ""Thankfully! I heard my phone rang and when I went to grab it I swerved into the other lane, but when I did that some jackass on the other side of the rode came into my lane. If I didn't swerve by mistake I would have been hit by an oncoming car."" I paused, stunned at what she said. ""Imhometakemedrunk, mom. I...I just thought something horrible happened and had to check on you."" Too this day my mom is convinced I can see things before they happen. But this wasn't the nail in the coffin for that belief of hers. This next story is.

This took place when I was maybe 11-12 years old, everyones face was blurry. I could never make out anyone in the pictures, the only thing that stood out was the frames. These cheap golden thin frames that were all falling apart and looked very tacky. At the bottom of the stairs there was a door in front of you that led to the back yard and a doorway to the left that led to the kitchen. As soon as I would turn to the kitchen I was filled with terror, almost piss myself, and then wake up sweating. This happened for several months. Neither myself or my mother could ever make sense of it. After several months of these dreams happening, my mom received a call from one of her few close friends that she wanted us (my mom, myself, but since my moms friend had a very cute daughter around my age I begged us to go. So we all got there and were hanging out upstairs in the kids room while my moms friend and her boyfriend were downstairs talking. My mom was with all of us looking at their rooms and catching up. I wanted something to drink so I decided to go downstairs for some soda. As I rounded the first turn of the stairwell, there was my moms friend, was the moment my mom thought that I must he psychic.

So about 7 or 8 years ago on Christmas day, and on the back of them was each of our individual names engraved into the surface. I got a black one, and both of my sisters got theirs in white. I was around 12 at the time, and my sisters were 15 &amp; 17. We were obviously extremely happy with these, as we weren't used to getting such expensive gifts from Santa. We loved and cared for these for many years - they were undoubtedly our most prized possession at the time. We used them solidly for at least 3 years, but technology continues to improve and we kept up with the improvements, and eventually their use started to diminish.

So whilst on holiday the other day, and how good they were at the time. The glitch, however, is that my sister reveals to us that now she has not one, but TWO of the SAME iPod. She swore they were the same colour, same model, same exact freaking iPod. Even down to having her name engraved on the back of both copies

We took an old avenue that leads straight to my house, surrounded by wooden planks, and with lots of dirt around blocking the way. This is not unusual here, because there's always some public pipes to repair. My friend decided to make a right turn, then turn left two times, going around the block to keep the original path. 

When we were back in the avenue, we kept looking just waiting to see the worst, because we thought it was going to fall into the hole but nothing happened, the car kept going until the beginning of the avenue and then turned so we lost sight of it. 

We were astonished! There was no hole, nothing. We kept looking back for a few minutes in total disbelief, the rest of the street was empty. We put ourselves together and my friend kept driving.

There was nowhere for the van to go. I couldn't have gone off the cliff because of the trees and we would have seen it anyway. It couldn't have turned around and sped off because it was only out of view for two seconds...

I'm certain it wasn't a false memory because I took the precaution of noting what I saw for that reason. I did this mainly because I am someone who has never experienced anything strange and I felt compelled to attempt to verify it.

I hadn't slept much the night before and hoped to get some sleep in the bus which wasn't the case because I still had that eerie feeling. that night around 5AM we entered southern france through spain and I finally managed to fall asleep.
now I don't remember many details but I dreamed of a bus like the one I was travelling in crashing. It went trough the guardrail and tumbled down a long way. I woke up drenched in sweat as I remember feeling the fear of the people in the bus. So I woke up and everything was okay but the feeling in my gut was gone and I was still a but puzzled about that very vivid dream.
I mean I could re-tell alot of details I otherwise would have never remembered (2 people died, somewhere in france I thought, bus company was something with europe I thought)
I passed it off as just a nightmare and around 2ish in the afternoon we finally arrive in the netherlands. 
the radio switched to a dutch frequency and they were broadcasting the news. 
ofcourse they tell of a bus accident in southern france that killed 2 people and injured many. they said the bus went trough the guardrail and tumbled down a hill. 

I remember the fear I felt in that...dream. I remember screams and people's faces. I remember being scared myself so very clearly but I wasn't on that bus. and the company which I thought to be something with europe? It's euroliner.

I think it was a vision or something. or it runs in the family cause my aunt told me she had a vision or dream once of a plane crashing and later on the news they told of a plane crash and she could re tell every single detail. something spiritual maybe?

We typically went out every day and spent about 8-10 hours looking for weapon burial sites in order to destroy whatever was left there. We would check out an area for an hour or two and drive to a new location. My best friend was alone most of that day manning the mounted machine gun in the back of one of our Hummers. I had been riding in a different vehicle with most of my squad that day

The next site lay down one of the most dangerous routes for roadside bombs, including me. The fourth Hummer had eleven people in it, which for a Hummer, is pretty jammed packed. The squad leader in charge of the fourth Hummer decided he wanted to take our spot in the convoy, and I got angry and told him no, and to get back into his own spot. I had no idea why I got angry at him, as it really doesn't matter which one of us was in the third position. I remember distinctly asking myself why the hell I just yelled at him

As we were driving along, and look up at my friend on the machine gun, who looks back at me at the same time. He had a puzzled look on his face, and I told him something didn't feel right. He said he had the exact same feeling, then looked back down the road. About 30 seconds later, starting to get more nervous, I said to him ""you ready to get blown up?"" and chuckled. He gave me a nervous, then looked back down the road. Ten seconds later

I was flown by helicopter up to the hospital in the region, the one with eleven people in it. I then saw the Hummer, and realized that the exhaust pipe (which goes up the side of the Hummer) was nearly ripped off from a piece of shrapnel. My face had been right next to that pipe, but when I looked back I had turned away, saving my face from being blown off. 

Looking back on it all, that is frightening enough. Then, thinking about both my friend and I knowing we were going to get blown up got me too. My biggest memory will always be my last words to my friend, and I wish I could take them back.

As I said before, I had recently transferred schools due to a progressive program for gifted children and therefore knew no one. My first week of school was comprised of taking in my environment, and studying the many new faces that were presented to me. After the week was over, I had managed to get a grasp of my surroundings, as well as acquire a mental roster of my fellow classmates. Coming home on Friday, I was naturally exhausted from a over stimulating week, so I got a good night's rest. The dream that occurred that night however, but I definitely remember the message. The following morning I revealed this message to my mom... someone in my class was going to die, I knew that it was going to be one of two girls: Elizabeth or Julia. 

As the year progressed and I started to become acclimated to my new school, and be unable to do much of anything but stay inside. As the year progressed, I felt stronger in my conviction that someone was going to die, but now was slightly frightened that it could be me. I felt a connection to these two girls that I did not feel with my other classmates. I can't explain it, but we all felt very similar. 

Moving to spring time, something that many of my classmates had been looking forward to for months. A week prior to this highly anticipated event is when the premonition occurred. I don't know if I can even call it a premonition, as it starkly contrasted from anything I have ever experienced. Beginning approximately one week before the start of the event, up until the night before, I dreamt nothing but the color white. Every night, it would be the same. No dreams, no visions

The day of the event was full of excitement and energy. The festival was to take place after lunch, like I had always done, when I suddenly fell due to stepping on the ball. When I hit the ground, I let out an ""ow"", and although it was strange, it wasn't anything serious, so I got back up and finished my recess. After the break, and children and teacher alike adorned renaissance costumes and took part in various art activities. About halfway through the festival, and the feeling of tension was palpable. The activities had come to an end rather abruptly due to this happening

The following day at school, the recess that I had fallen and cried out in pain, Elizabeth didn't say much.

Back when I was a sophmore in highschool (2005-2006), “the old main”. The building was built in the 1930's, I believe, and was legally condemned while I was attending school there. The year this took place happened to be the last year there were any students allowed in the building. So yes, this was an old building at an even older school (opened in the 1910's), and this highschool had legends of ghosts, as any old school does, a girl fell down a long set of stairs, there was nothing particularly odd or creepy about the building.

So... during a normal class period, I noticed that it was connected to a long, tile-floored, hallway. Not knowing this room was there, and thinking I'd never see it again, I wandered in. I felt uneasy the moment my foot went from the carpet to the tile. The only window was an old skylight, so everything in it was a cold, hue. This hallway was taller than the rest of the rooms on this floor of the building; guessing by the skylight

After class, and as I rounded the corner of the building it occurred to me that I should see what this hallway looked like from the outside. It wasn't there. Where it should have been was just air. I could see in the windows of the last classroom on the hallway, and the windows into a hallway in the adjoined building, which if the room I found had been visible, would have been impossible to see. These two buildings shared an interior wall and formed a rough “L” shape. This bizarre hallway would have been in the interior 90 degree angle of the “L”.

I am sure that the windows on the adjoining building (the district office at the time and the original building of the school), in choir, would walk down it to sing at the yearly holiday district staff party. The hallway I had been in earlier had no pictures.

I've explained this room to other classmates, and I always avoid being close to where this hallway should be; it just creeps me out too much.

To explain, dream something as normal, wake up either already forgetting about it, or passing it off as a normal dream and forgetting about it almost immediately.

Then, I have a MASSIVE sense of deja vu and remember that I've dreamed this. I'm able to tell what will be said next or what is about to happen. Not very far in the future mind you.

For example, I had a dream where I was in a room that I had never been in before, on a couch, talking with two guys who I hardly knew at that point in time, and I was being really friendly with them as if we were pals. This is my first term in university now. The room was the student lounge where I always hang out now, and the people are good friends now. I didn't remember the dream as soon as I walked into the lounge on day one, or as soon as I saw them at the school, I recognized and realized that if I had known better

Other info, seeing a tree from a certain angle with the right lighting. Seeing the tree any other way won't set it off.) I've attempted lucid dreaming VERY passively, and should probably try again, but the problem there is that I'd be altering the dream so that I won't be able to accurately see what will happen. It would help with remembering though.

Obviously a ""Glitch in the Matrix"" is a great catch-all term, being added) from/to your household.  

The only glitch I can think of, published in 1977 - the year of my birth.  I never purchased the book - it was not in the inventory of the house when I moved in.  I've also moved since then and no longer have it in my possession.  I remember calling my parents, friends, asking if it was theirs', in case they had inadvertantly left it there.  No successes.  The idea of a temporary parallel universe colliding with our own, would make it explainable.  Perhaps in another universe I *did* buy it.  Or a friend *did* bring it (for whatever reason you need to buy a book from 1977).

Thinking more, and sometimes they are disastrously wrong (in the case of that recent case of the 3 kidnapped girls, painfully so)...  but what if in the universe the psychic saw, that *was* the outcome?  Not being aware of parallel universes it would just look like an error in ours, no?

Are ghosts that some people apparently see - brief windows in to other universes

What gets more interesting, but everything is as it ""should be"" (and I use that term loosely).

**EDIT**

&gt; **Driving alone** and feeling the car ""teleport"" forward a few yards may not be a glitch, however. Courtesy of anteater1138

I've also seen this referred to recently. Here there are even more factors that are potentially involved; tiredness, only to realise that you haven't been concentrating and can't honestly recall anything from the last 5 minutes? If you want more information, Google how the brain goes into auto-pilot in relation to the striatum. Come on guys, this isn't some crazy, unexplained phenomenon.

&gt; Quantum mechanics and quantum suicide really don't work in the way the layman would think, one wouldn't be aware because memories are stored physically in the brain and wouldn't ""hop"" with it. Don't bring QM up unless you know what you are talking about. Courtesy of anteater1138

This one is starting to irritate me slightly. There are a couple of people here that are posting on all of these 'black out' style posts, this shouldn't even be a topic of conversation. If you're trying to be scientific, then you should know this. Stop trying to quote science if you don't understand it, it doesn't make your opinions valid, it actually makes them less so.

&gt; When you were a kid... **stop**. Due to the way human memory works, but most of them are obviously childhood confusion.

They could not find it anywhere, and my mum was devastated. It was a very distinctive ring, made of titanium, in a very plain design

Two years later, and I started to sort through them. I made a pile of boxes in order to reach the top shelf, which contained books I hadn't read in years. Up there was an encyclopaedia, which used to be my favourite book. I wanted to have a look through it again before it got moved to the loft, so I started to pull it off the shelf.

The furniture in my room was different and there was a military uniform hanging up in the room as if I was going to put it on.

I looked out the window and there was an amusement park within about a half mile of my house (there isn't one in real life).  I turned around and saw her one more time.  She looked older and seemed shocked to see me.  Then I passed out and... woke up.

The thing that strikes me about these dreams is the consistency.  Each time I had them (and I had a lot of them) it was like picking up with your day after you wake up from a nap.  The aging that took place in the dreams seemed to match the aging in my real life.  Yeah,,False,,t5_2tcwa,False,,True

My mum came home and found my car in the driveway, the grass mown, and me in the shower a bit too long before she checked I was OK.

Thing is, but it's a tight winding city/mountain drive with city speed limits for a good third of it), let alone drive, arrive, mow the lawn there (it's almost an hour's job), and shower.

Next morning I checked with my flatmates and the lawn there had indeed been mown by the time one of them had arrived home after finishing work at 5, but in mum's shower was a fresh change I don't remember getting into covered in grass clippings.

When I was about 9, so all the windows and doors in the house were closed. Our windows were single pane, but there were two of them, so basically you had the interior window with a spring-loaded latch, then an open space between it and the exterior window of about 3 inches. I guess it was like, a precursor to double paned windows or something.

So I threw my paper airplane and it curved sharply to the right, I couldn't find it anywhere. The rooms in that house were really small--it was a 14 foot wide mobile home, so there really couldn't have been any place it could have gone that I wouldn't have seen it. I crawled out from under a table and looked up at the window and flipped out, because it was actually in between the two closed windows, nose down. I had to call my mom and brother in to look at it to make sure I wasn't hallucinating or something, and I remember slapping my hand on the glass.

As a hotel desk agent, with cabinets underneath. Just above this are a set of three shelves, each a couple inches wide. It's important to note that the shelves don't stick out as far from the wall as the counter top below them does. On one of these shelves we place two metal bowls full of fruit. Usually we replace the fruit every other morning, so the bowls just stay there overnight. When I came into the lounge that particular morning, the fruit looked fine, so I didn't touch or move the bowls at all. 

Before I even went near the buffet, about 10-15 feet removed, when something bizarre happened. All of a sudden, one of the bowls of fruit was not on the shelf anymore. It was *poised* in midair at least three feet horizontally from the shelf's edge yet at exactly the same height from the ground. I didn't see it move or slide to that position. It just appeared there, as though I were watching a film clip with a few frames missing. It didn't float, exactly, but it seemed to linger for just a fraction of an instant too long before it crashed to the ground. The fruit shot everywhere. An orange rolled into the corner of the room. I was absolutely frozen with the *wrongness* of what I'd just seen.

My first thought was that the shelf had collapsed. Yet the second bowl of fruit was still resting atop it, but rather fell straight to the floor a few inches in front of the cabinet doors. If the fruit bowl had merely tipped off the shelf, it would have hit the counter top. Whatever had moved the bowl had to have enough force to throw it several feet away from the shelf before it fell. No one but me was in the lounge, nor could anyone have entered without my noticing. And even though it was early in the morning, I know I didn't entirely dream the incident because the phone rang a few minutes later with my manager saying we'd received a noise complaint from an adjacent room.

Nothing was broken, and all plates were fine. The next evening, my mother was cooking dinner and bumped into my grandmother (who is clumsy), and she dropped the plate in her hands. Exact same sounds, except for a yelp that came from my grandmother who is jumpy and nervous.

 The second thing is similar, no rain, and the sidewalks are totally dry. At that moment (when I looked out), the sound of falling rain stopped. The whole day went by without a drop from the sky.

My parents have a house in Washington but decided to move to California around June 2010 and left me and my brother to watch their house. In June 2011, but it was during my Fall quarter in college) I was sleeping in my bedroom on the second floor when I was suddenly woken up by loud knocks on my bedroom door. I woke up and kind of freaked out because I was all alone in the big house. I checked my phone and it was 1:30 AM. I got up and went to open the window. I can remember I was so freaked out that I forgot the window was locked. The thought of being locked in my own bedroom made me even madder and sweat even more. I tried to calm down and realized the darn lock and was able to open the window. I took a few deep breaths in the fresh air then walked to the bedroom door and opened it. There was no one. I then thought it could have been my imagination. I am a pretty practical guy so it would take a whole lot more to convince me that something supernatural had happened, otherwise, it would be more logical to think that my brain was simply experiencing some hallucination from dreaming. Then I went back to sleep.

And it happened again. This time I heard 3 loud knocks which I can still remember clearly today. I looked at my phone. It was 2:00 AM. This time I knew something must definitely have gone wrong here. I am living alone and I remember having locked my doors tight before going to sleep

I decided to walk down stairs to check the doors. They were all locked. I didn't want to sleep any more so I opened Yahoo Messenger to talk to my buddy who lives in a different country. I told him the event and we talked till 3:30 AM when I felt sleepy and decided to go back to sleep.

That's my story. Still confuses me whenever I think about it.

**TL;DR: living alone in a big house

Edit: just to make it clear: I don't believe in ghosts. Even after such event

I have been coming up with several theories for that. The simplest one that I discussed with my buddy right after the event was the abnormal change in temperature. It is usually cold inside my house as I keep the inside temp around 60-65 during night time. This could have resulted in the strange sounds. This theory doesn't sound very strong to me though because the sounds were very clear and distinguishable as knocking.

Our obvious thought was that the place where class was taking place had changed and we forgot about it or didn't hear about it. However

We went back, I spoke to another friend. Coincidentally, she had been on the second story of the building as class was due to start. A window looks out below to the gate that leads to the class.

1363797260.0,1ao5vk,Tabloids predicted three events that came true in 1996.,vampedvixen,90,19,24,"I've been lurking here for a few weeks

Back in 1996, I just read it in the store like a delinquent). I was into ghost stories/paranormal shit back then so I picked up some tabloid. It was one of those newspapers where the cover story is usually something like ""Woman in Newark Gives Birth To BatBoy (Exclusive Photos Inside!)""

It must have been around the end of the year/beginning of 1996, a bombing at the Olympics in Athens, Georgia, and a plane crash in the Atlantic Ocean near Long Island. I put the magazine away, bought some candy and put it out of my mind for the time being because as much as I was into the paranormal, I didn't really buy into any real predictions like that.

There was a Blizzard in February of 1996, but I was more focused on the fact that school was canceled for a week and a half. Being fourteen at the time, the fact that the world was covered in snow and the multitude of snowdays given to us took precedence in my thoughts.

Then on July 17, Veronica, called me that day and we were chatting on the phone about random shit and then the conversation turned to the news. I took a chance at her calling me crazy and told her at that point what I had read a few months earlier. I told her that the blizzard was the first sign I missed and that there would be a bombing at the Olympics as well. We didn’t know what to make of the weird circumstances but decided to wait and see what happened during the summer games.

Even today, wondering if I could have done something to prevent it. I was just a kid then though, and I didn’t have much to go on (a blizzard in New England during winter? What are the odds? *rolls eyes*). I’ve been told since then that there were probably several people who read that same tabloid and were in a better position to do something, but it’s still kind of haunting even now. 

I remember watching the parade of nations coming in on opening day during the 1996 Olympic Games. It was this weird feeling of dread

About a week into the games, and I was sitting in front of the television, watching the news coverage and told her that yeah, I saw it, and yeah, I knew it would happen. She asked me again how I knew and I told her that all I knew was that I read it somewhere.

Since that day, so I haven’t found much of anything in the past decade and a half. I haven’t told many people about this because it was just too weird. I don’t have many explanations for what happened. The only rational way I can explain it (other than the wild idea that these tabloids really do have psychics working for them, oohhh hocus pocus, and all that jazz) might be that since these things were man-made disasters (other than the giant blizzard, but like I said before that wouldn't be too hard to guess) that someone might have caught wind of people high up plotting them, tried to go to the regular newspapers and was written off as a conspiracist and the only newspaper they were able to use to tell the world were these tabloids.

I did have a shrink once who my parents forced me to go to because I was having physical problems the doctors all thought were caused by stress (found out later that I had cuts all through my intestines, but I told him about it because the anniversary of Flight 800 was coming up and it was on the news. He got this wary look in his eyes like ‘oh, she’s reeeeally crazy, I’m gonna have to prescribe LOTS of pills for her’ and asked me “So, you think you can see the future, then?” Apparently the belief that one can see the future can be attributed to so many different mental illnesses. I just rolled my eyes at him, because he clearly hadn't been listening to me at all. “No. I don’t think I can see the future. I think I can read.”

1361249831.0,18su45,"Child Disappears From House for 2 Hours, After Entire House Searched By Police and Dogs, Mysteriously Reappears in 2nd Story Bedroom (Time Warp?)  ",Banjerpickin,98,13


While this did not happen to me, we'll call her Jane.


When Jane was 4 her family lived in a suburb with a park nearby.  She had had some health problems related to breathing as a child, she was playing in the living room on the 1st floor.  Her mom left her there for just a few moments to go do something in the kitchen, and upon returning was startled to find her daughter gone, toys still laying on the floor.  Her mom began doing a quick search of the house, assuming Jane had gone upstairs to her bedroom on the 2nd floor.  Her mother called her name and looked for her in her normal hiding spots on both floors, and quickly became worried that her usually arm's length away daughter was not coming at her command.


Her mom considered that perhaps Jane had decided to leave early for their usual evening stroll to the park (even though this would be extremely unusual behavior for Jane), Jane was no where to be found. Jane's mother got on the phone and called her husband, who said he would call the police to report Jane missing and that he was leaving work to come home immediately.  At this point, about 45 minutes had passed since Jane had last been seen.  


The neighbor had gone back to the house and done her best to search for Jane, and everyone again searched the house for almost half an hour.  When Jane did not turn up, and since she had been missing for over an hour now, the police chief ""officially"" declared her missing (or something like that, not 100% sure how it works), not something taken lightly.  They brought the search dog in and let it start getting Jane's scent from her clothes, which were all in her room.  


With all of the police officers, and Jane's mom and dad all in the house, something very strange happened next that no can explain.  The police were about to let the search dog out the front door, when Jane's dad suddenly got a weird feeling that somehow no one had checked the toy fridge in Jane's room that she sometimes hid in.  Even though Jane's mom was positive they had looked, he just had the feeling he needed to check it out.  He went upstairs into her room, and opened the fridge.  Jane was not inside.  


When Jane's dad turned around, peacefully and silently asleep.  


A). Her breathing problem did not allow her to sleep silently (she often snored, and everyone yelling her name should have woken her, and they should have been able to hear her snoring (which she weirdly was not doing).  She awoke immediately as her father shouted ""I found her!""

B).  Her room was obviously meticulously searched several times, the dog handler actually thinks he picked the blankie up to have the dog smell it, but no one can 100% remember)

C).  Jane developed a fear of sleeping with the window open that still affects her today.


I don't know redditors


**TL;DR** My friend Jane disappears for 2 hours while she is 4, which her health problems shouldn't have allowed.  

EDIT:  Grammar and general readability 

EDIT 2:  Jane is a friend of mine and we met in college.  I knew her for several years before she told me this story for the first time, perhaps that has helped the cope with/rationalize the experience.  

EDIT 3:  While reading again this morning I realized I forgot the crucial detail that Jane woke up as soon as her father yelled ""I found her!"" ",,t5_2tcwa,1361378102.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/Glitch_in_the_Matrix/comments/18su45/child_disappears_from_house_for_2_hours_after/

I turned on my computer one morning and I found an image file in the middle of the desktop which hadn't been there the night before (I'm pretty sure of it). Curious, but we had no Internet or games, so I could only draw in Paint then. I don't remember drawing that particular picture but I'm sure I did because it looks just like others I drew around that time (my mom still keeps a box full of them). And according to the file data it really was created in 1998.
But the strange thing is that I have no idea how the file got to my desktop. The computer I used when the file appeared is not the same computer I drew the picture on. I'm sure I didn't copy any files from our first computer - it broke rather suddenly and I remember being sad about losing all my files. These computers have absolutely no connection.

The car two cars in front of me was following another car really close. I knew what was going to happen and backed off. As I did the car in front slammed on their brakes. The car following them had to swerve in the median. There was no guardrail and it was all grass. They lost control and skidded all the way over to the other side of oncoming traffic. This caused a huge wreck in the eastbound lane that involved at least 12 cars that I saw wreck. This should have caused a huge pile-up that should have blocked interstate up for a while. My mom was heading that direction at the same time but was about 15 minutes away from that particular section. I called her to tell her to be careful. I asked her the next day if she saw the wreck. She said nothing was there. I looked at all the local news and there was nothing.

As a child I lived in Mexico for about 3 years with my grandmother.  Her home was very simple and in a very poor neighborhood.  I was about 8 or 9 at the time.  My grandmother's house consisted of a ""living room"" which contained the dining room and her bed

However

Either way apparently I am the only person that remembers that there was a door in between the bed and the dining table.  This door led to a set of about 8 stairs and a room that stank of dirt.  The room was full of family pictures and other stuff from my memories.  I distinctly remember doing various things in this room.  I kept my bike in there and would go there everyday to get it and put it back.

Anyway, but one day I asked my mom and she said it was an original ""picasso"" that my uncle had brought home. I remember the picture very clearly but i have not found a picture of it online.  It is a woman wearing red lipstick and a blue cowboy hat.  It was very abstract.  I saw that painting throughout my childhood in that room.

It was 2007


My friends and I had a pretty good hangout for our weekends. Unfortunately


We made the most of it though and over the last couple of years, TV, projector, fridge, microwave, a couple couches, a fireplace and a whole heap of chairs.


Usually we'd congregate there on a Friday after school and leave Sunday afternoon (or Monday if it were a public holiday or something). We'd bring our computers as well and set up a LAN and trade any new movies/games/TV shows we'd downloaded etc. and also occasionally game as well.


The age groups varied a little as the there was an age gap between the two brothers that owned the property. One was about 4 years older than the other, facing towards a dark paddock that wasn't used for anything.


All in all, there were about 8 of us there. 


I remember the night quite vividly to this day. It wasn't long after my birthday in August and was the middle of winter (Australian). We were all sprawled out on the couches/beds watching a movie on the projector when I decided that I needed to take a leak.


It was dark outside, the trees they were parked under, the fence further on and a small glimpse of the paddock further again.

I stepped out of the shed (the red area's are the doors) and started making my way towards the cars when after only a few paces I stopped and gazed ahead. The distance between the house and the cars would roughly be 15 metres and based on where I was


The reason I stopped was because the older brother was standing ahead, a yellow/brown fleece jumper, khaki cargo shorts and brown shoes. I remember thinking it was odd because it was a cold night. Cold enough for the rest of us to be wearing jeans/hoodies, yet there he was in shorts.

I watched him for maybe 5 seconds before he started to move. He walked between two of the cars under the trees and then started walking left

Now


Puzzled and a little uncomfortable, standing at the entrance of the shed. I glanced to my left (to where all the bunks/seats were) in search of the younger brother.

I froze. According to my friends

My best friend at the time and I used to have a band that practiced in a pool house outside of his home. His parents were cool with us using the place during the cold months

After one Such party, someone had spilled some Sunkist or something, and we had to collect all of the garbage. While we worked, we just talked about dumb things like girls and music. When we were finally done, we each grabbed one of the huge industrial sized garbage bags (these people really like to party) an stepped outside of the pool house to go dispose of them.

 We were deep in discussion about a new band's album that had just come out, until he asked me 'wait, what did we do with that trash?'


I genuinely didn't know.


We assumed we had just gotten lost in conversation and had put them somewhere

Absolutely no where.

i stayed like this for a while, framing one up with his phone, me as the subject.  i humored him and got up when  i was sure he got it.

that sunday (8th) i got sick and had to stay in hospital for a week.  when i came back, but it was from a party two saturdays ago, at which, i was absolutely hammered.  i had not been drinking that night and i don't recall going to a party that saturday, so i was quite confused.  but he still had the picture and showed it to me.  

in the picture was him in front, but it was draped over my lap, and the hat was absent from the photo completely.  i asked if i could check the date of the picture, and sure enough it read saturday (7th).

to time because of some unexplained occurrences in my life and enjoyed reading other 
people's experiences. I created this account just for Glitch. I will submit different 
posts for other events but I will start with this one.

It was just a few weeks before Father's Day
manager that provided a rent free apartment
2011. I was very reluctant to accept this position but I did because it was the only way  I could afford housing for my wife

Prior to this job I was layed off from a great job with a Fortune 100 company that  resulted in my family losing our home and both of our vehicles being repossessed. A few months prior to that our daughter was born and just a few months before that my wife had been layed off. It was an eventful 2010

Back to the event. I had constantly been judged and ridiculed by a fellow site manager  and was always being compared to this individual by upper management as the employee I needed to emulate. After about 9 months of this type of environment I was beginning to feel like complete shit. Worthless, the apartment did not have cable.

I mentioned this to said fellow manager and he began to brag about the steal he got at  Target for some rabbit ears, believe it or not. I get home, plug in the antenna and my wife and I watch some TV. I never told anybody about that episode in Target, not even the other manager. 

The next day my mother in law  had taken it upon herself to surprise my wife and I with a resort stay for Father's Day.  We were ecstatic and headed on our way while our daughter stayed the weekend with my  mother in law. Everything was amazing, spas, food, etc. Well  it comes time to check out and we get into my truck when I noticed something stuck under my wiper blade. It turned out to be a bunch of one dollar bills folded up and green  stick it note that had REMEMBER THE ANTENNA written on it. My wife thought it was pretty sweet that we just made $17 lol. I, on the other hand, was  having a silent brain meltdown because I was the only person that knew what had happened at Target. My receipt, and antenna box went right into the trash, no bank account with online banking to check balances...nothing. Now the  handwriting on the note was identical to how I would have written it

Any ideas from you guys on what the hell just happened?!
Thanks for sticking with me on this one hehe.

Tuesday morning was just like every other morning, I stay straight instead of veering to the right at the first stop light. (This isn't a problem though because I just have to go over an extra block to continue on my route).  After that minor mistake, things started to get weird.

The road that I was on was the Main Street in my town so it sees a pretty good amount of traffic, I drive through the intersection as the light turns green.  This is when i think the glitch was in full effect.

Two blocks ahead is a skate/snowboard shop that I have been going to since the late 90s and every time I drive by the shop I look into the windows, or midnight. As I pass the second light everything got gradually quieter and I saw that there was not a car in sight ahead of me or coming towards me, although there were cars parked on the side of the road. I get to the second block and, just like every other time, I look into the shop, but what I saw shocked me. I look to me left and I see myself in the window flipping the closed sign to open!

About 11:30 PM I started a load of dishes in the dishwasher.  The dishwasher is built into a countertop that forms a divider between the kitchen and the living room.  My mother's hospital bed was on the other side of that divider.  My computer was in another room

Just before midnight, loud beeping sound.  After just a moment to process what had just happened and figure out what was making that sound, I got up and headed out into the kitchen, only to discover that the dishwasher motor seemed to be making a squealing noise, again something it had never done before, and the baby monitor was probably picking that up as a kind of beeping noise.  I then realized it was almost exactly the stroke of midnight (I am not making this up) and I went around the counter to check on my mother.  I leaned close to her face to listen for her breath and she took one final gasp of air and that was it, she was gone.  The only thing I could figure is that she had wanted me to be by her side at the moment of physical death.  There was nothing spooky or creepy about it; I had been her primary caregiver for several months, but because of what the hospice nurse had said I wasn't expecting it until sometime later in the day.

The dishwasher only made the squealing noise (like metal rubbing on metal, but it was a very old dishwasher and was already on its last legs so I finally replaced it.  But only that one time did it ever make a prolonged set of intermittent squeals.  Could it have been coincidence?  I suppose, but if so it was a heck of a coincidence, and when I heard the beeping on the baby monitor I just knew that wasn't normal, and that I needed to go out to the kitchen/living room area right then to see what was causing it.

I'm pretty sure I was the only pedestrian walking on the sidewalk. As I looked forward, just making sure I wouldn't bump against any sign posts or anything, I realized the strangest thing. I seemed to be walking behind myself. Same converse shoes with the exact same wear and tear, same jeans, same white t-shirt, it got even stranger. As I stopped walking, and it was gone.

The second time it happened was in August 2008. Walking home again, they looked confused.

Another weird thing was this one time when I looked in the mirror and the reflection there wasn't my own. A friend of mine also experienced this

Third one. Sleeping at home

Last one, all the neighbors know each other and it's kinda hard to go anywhere without being noticed. I was feeling kinda tired after dinner, so I decided to take a nap. I laid in bed and closed my eyes. My parents and my grandma were watching TV in the living room, which is right next door to my room. Anyway, I woke up and all the lights were out, everything was silent. My first thought was ""Oh shit, I must've slept for too long"". I reached for the light, I said to myself, which meant I only slept for two hours and everyone was supposed to still be awake. I got out of my room, no lights on the other houses as well. I went next door and knocked. No answer. At this point I was already freaking the fuck out. I stood outside for what seemed like 5 minutes or so

Like I mentioned, ""Yeah, that's what you said last time, you almost ran us off a cliff"". 

I immediately checked my memory

The rest of the way there we went back and forth, but at the same time it was like I had to try really hard to remember. It's not like when you go to a major theme park and you walk in and it kind of clicks right away. I felt like I only had a cursory memory of the place. We asked her mom and her mom's boyfriend about it, and while they confirmed that they visited the zoo last summer, they couldn't quite remember if the two of us had come along. 

As we walked around, or ""No love, you got us lost the last time, it's this way to the coyotes"". I mean these were really vivid memories she had, and I could tell that she really believed them. But to me it was all new, I couldn't remember anything about the place other than the basic stuff from my one previous visit many years ago.

Two- I originally thought this was a case of disappearance/ reappearance.  My roommate ""loses"" his laptop power cable.  In reality, and there was nowhere for it to fall from).  It baffled us all.

First, so he took another job which forced him to travel to another province in my country back and forth. We couldn't just move there because my mom still had her job as an OBGYN in one of the local hospitals, but the pay was still crap and they needed my dad's income as well to fully support us. Anyhow, I was about 4 at the time, and had gotten a really bad case of pneumonia, which ended up with me hospitalized for about a month. I was very young and hadn't yet developed proper bodily defenses, so I went through a lot of complications.

My dad wanted to quit and stay with me, my pneumonia worsened to the point the doctors gave my mother the 'expect the worse' talk. They were gonna prep me for surgery the next day in what basically was a 'last attempt' for me to get better. When this happened, my dad was about 400 miles away, and my mom called to explain the situation. 

My dad has never been a religious man, he drove to a church he'd seen when he first came into the city. It was early in the morning and it was a week day so the place was pretty much deserted, and he sat intending to pray for me, which he did for a few moments (the usual things - help my daughter, please give me a sign she's gonna get better, etc) before he thought he was being incredibly stupid. 

He decided on the spot he would drive back home, he ran into a man, and he quickly apologized and kept on going. The man grabbed him by the arm and told him to wait. At this point my dad was getting frantic, he told me he was basically this close to yelling at this guy to fuck off (it's really hard for him to lose his temper), but that something about his demeanor just, calmed him down instantly. That he somehow felt safe and that things were going to be alright. He told me he doesn't remember anything particular about his appearence, it was just a middle aged man with a hat and an old coat

The man told my dad, for knowing his name and mine and saying that, and was frozen in place, considering he'd never seen this person before in his life (and this was another city hundred of miles away, nobody would know of our situation there). The guy smiled and walked away, but by the time my dad reacted the guy had walked around the corner and when my dad ran after him he couldn't find him anymore. He asked around the church but no one knew who he was/had never seen him. After that he called my mom to ask about me, and she told him the doctors said I wouldn't need the surgery in the end because my lungs had gotten better. After that I recovered pretty fast and was out of the hospital the next week.

Everyone decided to climb back down, we'd park in the back and turn the car lights off. Well, I once again, did not want to be apart of this. I told them I'd drop them off, and just text me to come back when they were finished. I did not feel right, something felt off.  

I dropped the other 4 guys off, I looked in the rear-view mirror and watched them all hike off into the woods in the dark. A lighter lighting up in the distance.  
 
After about 30 minutes
  
I start driving back, I notice, it's 2 of them! My friend that came with me, and one of the original guys from the game store. 

""What are you guys doing?"" As I pull up next to them. ""Dude! Dude!"" They are freaking out

""The cops came! They found us and said they saw us pull in then saw a car leave! It's after hours at the Park, and they got him, we ran away!""   

In their intoxicated state
  
""Back to the dorm."" he says. Fast forward. Back at the dorm, it's my fault.""  
 
All I could think about was that weird feeling I had as I drove off
  
The conversation goes south, he has to meet her there, this and that. Tells my friend and I to just go home, he'll see us at the game store in a couple of days.   
  
My friend and I decide to go and sit in the parking lot at a grocery store to pass the time and find out the final solution to everything
  
At the grocery store, we see a man, in his mid 30s. Sitting on a bench outside the front door.   
  
He casually says 'You guys had a crazy night.' Shocked for a second

He sits back
  
Not sure what he was on about
  
""Don't mistake bad luck for what's supposed to happen."" He tells us.  
Then as he speaks these words
  
He doesn't answer here, a young kid in the middle of the night, standing in front of a grocery store near 2 dirty looking grunge people, like some sort of a drug deal.  

The cop walks  by
  
The cop walks on into the store. ""Don't worry, he'll be okay. Your other friend, I know he made his way home."" 

""What?"" I suddenly ask. ""What are you talking about?"" How did he have this detailed of information, we have to go home now. It's finally our turn. We've taken care of you all."" Just a odd collection of words he puts together. My friend and I stand there, as the 'couple' it appears walks off to the other end of the building and parking lot... towards.. nothing. There were no parked cars. No busses. no taxis. Nothing. They just walked off in to the distance. 

Shocked by everything, ""My brother is out, everything is okay. My mom pulled strings or something, they just decided to let him okay. They are letting the charge go. Been a crazy night, huh? It's like someone was taking care of us. Anyways, I'll see you guys.""  
  
My friend, how did that guy know everything would work out?""  
  
We sat there, both trying to interrupt the night in our heads.  
  
The other guy.. still no word from him. A day goes by. Nothing. A week goes by nothing. A month goes by. The game store guy tells me that the other guy stopped showing up to work. He never called in or anything. A year goes by. No one has heard from this guy.

What seemed odd was that first of all he was sitting next to the bins and he seemed in obvious distress. Sort of rubbing his head

I kept watching him but he just didn't move and TBH he looked dead to me. Even though I could only see his back, half on the base, head hanging strangely. Very hard to describe but the whole scene screamed 'dead', not fainted. Honestly I would not have worried so much otherwise, maybe gone down slowly to ask if he needed water maybe.

However I waited a little longer

I came to the conclusion that he may have felt bad

So thinking back and forth

Yet when I got there he was gone. From being 'unconscious/dead' to having got up and run away in 6 seconds makes no sense. It would have taken him that long just to get back on his feet. He did not act or joke around as not only was he alone but where he was sitting nobody would have seen him anyway and the way he was so distressed before slumping was real. I thought he may have had a heart attack or a stroke.

Also from where I was standing, he didn't even know I had watched him???]. Even if he got up and gone into another house, it would have taken him longer than me going downstairs as the next door was quite far away [all withing sight] and again, he did not know I was coming down or that he was watched.

It seems minor but it has stayed with me forever since. The whole situation felt so eerie and weird. I had seen people collapsing before but this was really strange. It certainly wasn't a ghost as he was as solid as any normal person and nothing else screamed 'ghost' on that sunny day.

A few years ago, you know?

Anyway, other than ""well that's kinda interesting.""

Fast forward a few years.  That friend has moved away, I take that trail... or so, I intend to.  However, when I come to where the entrance to the trail used to be, there is nothing.  I think ""well, maybe it grew in?"" though it seemed very unlikely as the trail was very old, well beaten

I decide 'fuck it, maybe a few hundred feet across... so there's no way I could really just 'lose it'. However, upon bush-whacking my way to where the trail used to be, I realize that the place I used to know was completely gone.

Not in the way that it was grown over, or the trail, ever existed.  What used to be dense, thick woods was now wide open space with few trees.  In the middle of it all was an old truck that looked like it had been rotting there for 50 years.  There was some kind of utility pipe sticking out of the ground, which also looked a few decades old. Nor the truck, or pipe were ever there before. Where there used to be hills, covered in trees and brush

I know this might seem silly, you know it like the back of your hand.  It's very difficult to explain the profound difference I felt through text, but I know that it wasn't normal.  The area I used to know was very distinct and obvious. I can still remember the specific changes in terrain along the trail.

1355642811.0,14xmjs,The Nameless Hurricane,jloutey,73,13,25,"I came up with a theory some 10 years ago that everyone has precognitive ability. My idea was that it could be sharpened. So I set up a pseudo scientific experiment. 

I reasoned that if one was to improve their ability, I spent my idol thoughts for a while thinking about the future. Trying to predict what I would see when I opened the door to my house, stuff like that. IMHO it works best to visualize things you have a familiarity with, and try to take in all the information at your disposal. For example, I'd try to predict where I would find my roommate when I got home. Knowing his work schedule and habits I'd predict that he would be playing video games.  Stuff like that. 

After a while I noticed myself doing small things that kinda seemed like positive results. For example, and certainly subject to confirmation bias, but still. It was happening with a bit more regularity that would seem warranted. A cynic would argue that I simply learned how to find the video faster, and I would not argue against that. In fact, I'd say that processing the information at your disposal in required. 

Anyways, I saw a small rubber ball. Later I found that ball. It was one of those bouncy balls you can get from those candy machines for a quarter. Maybe I saw it the previous day and subconsciously recalled that, sure. But it seemed pretty amazing to me. What struck me was the way the idea came to me.  It wasn't a rational thought.  It didn't follow any sort of progression.  I just saw the ball in my mind and then found it. 

Flash forward a few weeks and I have this intense dream. I'm on the beach. It's dark. Twilight hours I think, half buried in the sand, several paces from the shoreline. Out to sea is a funnel cloud, but not like a tornado. Much bigger. It takes up almost the entire view. The feeling in the air is dread.

It's a hurricane. My body knows it. In my mind

I wake up in a cold sweat

The next morning I tell my roommate about this insanely vivid dream. Specifically I tell him about the hurricane being off the coast of Brazil. Well about a week later a hurricane hit's Brazil. They called it a tropical storm at first because hurricane strength winds had never hit the South America before. It hit the god damn exact spot I had dreamt about. I had to confirm with my roommate that I had told him the location information. I could barely believe it. I was pretty shaken up about the whole thing. 

The feeling of dread from the beach has never really left me. I'm kind of afraid to continue the experiments

Anyways. That's my story. Here's a news story about the hurricane if you're interested.

As usual when waiting for the lights to change, and we started crossing. As we walked, we kept an eye on the lights to make sure we had time to make it across comfortably.

About half way across the road, and suddenly the lights had changed again… but not back to red.

The plain green guy was now wearing wide-bottomed flares and glasses, and had a line of stars from in front of his forehead that trailed over his head and down his back, each one slightly bigger than the previous, like some kind of cloak. We all stopped dead and exchanged stunned looks. One of us (I forget which) said “Did you…?”; the other two both replied “Yes” before he could finish the sentence.

Then we remembered the traffic and hurried across the road, the red guy had changed too. He was now carrying a briefcase, smoking a pipe (with wisps of smoke rising), wearing a little homburg hat, and he had big brogues on his feet.

We watched at the lights cycle for ten minutes or so

A couple of days later, I heard about that.” I muttered something incredulous, and she told me that she’d seen an article in the press talking about how the council had recently changed the lights on that pedestrian crossing.

Apparently it was some sort of tribute about the death of a singer who had been famous in the sixties

I was far from convinced — the council changing the plates over the lights made sense

A few days later, with the shapes of the men etched out of the paint, and white bulbs behind.

The figures were based on the original templates of the walk/go men, or anything of that sort.

Just in case, but they stayed changed. A week after that, I went back again for another look, to get a sketch of the altered designs. I was disappointed to find that the lights were back to being perfectly normal.

It was our regular gathering a couple of days later

She didn’t remember me mentioning traffic lights, and neither did any of the others there. She had never heard anything about the council changing some pedestrian crossing lights, or even of a sixties singer dying recently. In fact, none of them remembered me saying anything much at our previous gathering. When I re-told the story, everyone seemed quite spooked by it all.

I have a moment of ""wtf seizure?!"" and run home. My head started to hurt after the second thud. I'm panicked-- not for myself, but because I feel like something is extremely wrong.

I was running late to my language class, but I couldn't see anyone through the window of the door from where I was standing. This didn't weird me out too much because sometimes we had class on the third floor. So I took the elevator down to the third floor, but that classroom was also empty. At this point I was wondering if my class had been cancelled, so i went down to the office on the first floor. I asked the office staff about it, and they told me that it was on the seventh floor.

So back to the elevator I went, but this time I went and had a proper look. The door was locked, the lights were off, and there was nothing and no one in the room, or on the entire floor. I checked the floor number, and it was definitely the seventh floor. So I went back down, checking the fifth (on a faint suspicion that there might've been another classroom there) and third floor just in case, who answered and said she was on the seventh floor with the two other students.

I took the stairs to the seventh floor, books all spread out, writing on the board, and the air-conditioning going strong.

My parents still live in the same house I grew up in. It's a small neighborhood surrounded by woods and dense shrubbery. As a child, ranging from 9 to 14 in age. We were playing on a sprawl of about 5 acres so there were plenty of places to hide. I walked along the fence line and decided to crawl in between some shrubs so I would have my back to the fence. That way no one could sneak up behind me and I could see an open clearing in front of me pretty well. I even remember bringing a fruit by the foot to snack on while I was waiting everyone out. 
I stayed hidden for probably twenty or so minutes when I heard some rustling leaves and heavy footsteps. I peered over the top of the bushes and saw someone I didnt recognize about 20 yards away in the open spot in the forest. It definitely was not any of the kids involved in the game. In my kid mind this person looked pretty old or at least ""grown up"" with red short hair and a white tshirt on walking across the clearing. I thought for some reason I was in trouble so I didnt dare call out to this person. That was the only way to rationalize the knot I got in my stomach while watching her. 
Right as this person was nearing the edge of the clearing on the opposite side and about to disappear into the thick brush, and crouch down out of my line of sight. The weeds and brush were just high enough to envelope her completely. I started to panick so I jumped from my hiding spot and darted over to this injured person. As stupid as it seemed, I was always brought up to help someone when they were in distress. But when I got there, she was gone. I stood exactly where she crouched down, I didn't even take my eyes off of the spot. Somehow, I rationalized to myself that she ran off and just didn't see her or maybe I had dozed off in the shade of my hiding place and dreamed it. I brushed it off and honestly never thought twice about what had happened until about 5 years ago. 
I was 19 and home for the summer from my first year of uni. While my parents were at work I decided to lounge around and sit out on the deck. As I opened the door, darted out the back door and straight into the woods by the house. I didnt even put shoes on because I was so scared of her getting lost, I just took off. I almost caught her but realized that me unintentionally charging her while trying to catch her was only driving her farther into the trees. I stopped and calmly walked behind her by about 15 feet, trying to softly call to her. But she was out of the house, old and scared so she panicked and darted away. That's when it happened. With my bare foot, I stepped on an old rusty piece of barb wire strewn across the path. I crumbled and hit the ground. I can't remember yelling out profanities but I'm sure I did. I was bleeding pretty badly so I took off my shirt to wrap around my foot as a make shift shoe/bandaid. Thankfully my parents house is far enough in the woods that didnt have to worry about someone spotting a girl in only a bra walking around. 
I made it back to the house and that's when it all came flooding back to me like deja vu(sp)?. The bloody white shirt wrapped around my foot and my freshly dyed red hair(as a rebellious statement I guess) and

I have always been a responsible person even as a kid, of her checking up at an odd time like this, especially by payphone. 

I went on the remainder of my childhood thinking the house was rigged with cameras or microphones. And believe me, she seemed to barely remember but she is a firm believer in the ""mother's intuition"" concept.

1358185821.0,16k7zd,The Abduction,Ryugi,74,16,76,"I have had a lot of strange experiences. Many of them so common

This night happened when I was 19 or so.

I was at Kore's house. She's a tall confident girl, and she'd experienced it since childhood of living there (though as a child, it was terrifying but she's not afraid anymore, but the reasons why are her story, not mine, should she choose to share).

We had a fun day together and were laying side by side on her bed in the pitch black darkness of a desert night in no-man's land (the town we live in has little/no public lighting, like the eyes of some kind of animals crawling on the ceiling and walls. There were a few dozen of them, but it wasn't unusual for us to see that sort of phenomenon.

I heard a weird noise, and a twisted smile just below it. There is nothing in this world as terrifying as what I saw, the face was some kind of devil or demon. I fell back against the bed and grabbed her left arm tightly, pushing my face into her side and whimpered. I said something, but I was stuttering and couldn't finish my sentence. I was trying to tell her about it, but all I could say was something like, ""its smiling at me"".

She saw it too, or the room around us was moving. She (uncertain of the origin of that vision) decided to treat it like a demon in her spirituality and claimed domain over the room, and demanded it leave. I felt something grab me, and I was shaking and overcome with spasms. I let go of her arm as she got up and something turned my body around in the bed, so instead of my head near the window, my feet were, and someone was holding both of my legs and part of my abdomen and trying to pull me out the window. I couldn't see anything, as though frightened off. Kore grabbed my arm and tried to hold me in

Then it's blackness. I feel a lot of time has passed, but it was locked or otherwise held down. There was someone outside the box walking around and digging through things, so I called out to them, ""I'm in here! Let me out!"" I felt a breath of cool air as the box was opened, and saw the face of someone I've never met before. He seemed relieved to see me.

Then it's darkness again, it had been almost 3 months since my sleepover at Kore's. 

I called my friends one at a time to try to piece together what had happened. Kore said that we went to bed the night of the sleepover, it was almost like I was acting and pretending to be me, and not doing a good job of it (I'm a fairly excitable/animated person, but I seemed robotic and distant). My girlfriend said that we'd had sex a couple times during the time I couldn't remember, but I never achieved full pleasure and didn't seem that into it. When I pleased her, it was very methodical and bland, and after she had orgasmed, though definitely not the way I would normally

I don't know how much of what happened to me was a nightmare, but it's like I was just going through the motions of my normal life, but it wasn't me. I wish I could find out who the man was that opened the box, but I have a feeling he doesn't exist, somehow...

Any similar experiences??

I ran out after to catch her, it took an hour, I got her and was ready to go to school. My aunt accidentally left her coat, looked at my teacher and just said, there was quite a build up of papers

From shock, I turn to anger, to the fact that the road had no signs to notify me of the upcoming turn.

We keep on driving through the night, back to joking, and enjoying our memories from the trip. We go to bed, and when I wake up, everything seems normal, and we go out with some friends to talk about the trip.

After we get back

I look at her thinking that she's joking or something. She's a bit of a narcissist and she knows she's very beautiful. I tell her, this is how she looks, that's what pictures do. She then continues to swiftly browse through the rest of the pictures continuously saying that she's ugly, that that's not her from the pictures.

I thought that maybe she just doesn't like her tan or whatever, barely catching their breath, that's how she cried. I couldn't stop her, she was in in uncontrollable shake.  This went on for THREE HOURS until she simply passed out and fell asleep. 

The next morning I thought that all that phase is behind us, and kept on going and going. She called her mother, sent her the pictures to confirm that that's her from the pictures. Her mother, as confused as I was, says that, yep, that's her from the pictures...

She fell into a deep depression for 2 weeks. I tried everything, advice, nothing helped. Eventually she stopped and said something along the lines that it doesn't matter who she is now, I'm the same and she loves me...

Since then, and can't think that maybe we actually died back there, but for some reason it simply didn't affect me, or I just don't remember it, but she does. We talked with other people about the ""near death accident"" and she always says that it wasn't near... we died. She says it in a joking way, expecting laughs, but I know she believes it.

One night I was sleeping and in my dream someone said very clearly ""Go out and look"" at that moment I immediately woke up it almost was like the voice was saying while I was waking up like I heard the end of the sentence while I was awake. Of course it all happened so fast. But then not 3 seconds after I awoke from hearing that my bedroom door which was previously closed opened all by its self. Not in a violent way but I heard it unclick from the side and open up. At this point I would normally be freaking out but for some reason it all just seemed so calm. I got up thinking my dog was probably awake but when I opened the door and looked out the big kitchen window it was the most beautiful snowfall I've ever seen! Huge snow flakes falling so gently and for some reason the outside sensor light was on but it just made the snowflakes look so clear and pretty.

This is going to sound like the most irrational and silly thing ever

I am in my 30s. I am pretty normal, content in my life, and so on. 

A few weeks ago, so clicky click. 

There was someone talking in the video
A few clicks more and there they were on camera.

I do not even know how to explain ... The closest I can come... Imagine being in love with someone, only more painful. But there was nothing behind the emotion. There was nothing rational that would explain it. I don't know the person. But it felt like I *should*. It felt as if I knew them, cared very deeply about them at some point, but had somehow forgotten them. 

I actually thought I believed in love at first sight. I have been attracted to someone the first time I met them. But they fit into the category of ""my type"". The attraction was distinctly physical. This was completely different. They aren't what I would have considered my type. They aren't what would typically be considered particularly attractive by common standards. There is no rational explanation I can come up with.

I have absolutely no clue what triggered this. It is seriously a wtf moment. I do not know them, with only the emotion itself and the incredible sadness of not knowing where it comes from remaining.

...and that sums it up.
It is really a strange and distressing feeling because I do not know the other person at all and there is absolutely no reason I can come up with to have such a strong emotion toward them. If I just found them really physically attractive, it honestly feels as if I really should know them and know why I feel this way, but for some reason I can't recall things properly.

Thought I'd share my only glitch moment with you all!

For the last six months, I would often finish late (being eager to leave a good impression etc.) and need to catch the 4.50 home instead. 

So I did this for a couple of months until one day I left work late and went to catch the 4.50 train. I arrived at the station and there was nobody there. It was cold and getting dark. The train was late. After around 15 minutes

It was at this point that I realised the timetable had the 4.11 and the 5.54 as consecutive journeys. Nothing in between. 


I was so confused! The timetable was old and weathered and had undoubtedly been up on that wall since I started my job. I checked thetrainline app on my phone (where I had originally learned of the 4.50) and the information matched the timetable!


I swear to you


The only way I can rationalise it is in thinking that every single time I caught the 4.50


I always catch the 4.11 now but the experience was so concrete to me that even the other week

Sometime in August 1991, this memory has been blanked out, and the aforementioned post just rocketed it back into my memory. 

My mum (grandmother) and I were coming home from a trip to a Toys R Us, she had been on medication to prevent infections or swelling following a cataract operation on her right eye. She could see just fine, but was taking the meds as a preventative measure. This will play a very important part in what happens next.

So we're driving down Rt 9, without a seatbelt on. The next thing I know, I'm looking out the back window of the car, and am scrambling to get the hatch open in our 1989 Ford Escort. My mum had hit the steering wheel, her seatbelt failed. We had hit a telephone pole at what I was later told was almost 45 miles per hour. The whole front of the car was destroyed, and the car had gone part way up the pole. Best I can figure is that she had a reaction to her medication, passed out, and hit the pole.

I remember being outside the car, my mum would need that for the car.

We were both put in an ambulance and taken to hospital. I kept coming in and out of consciousness

Here's the really fucked part, with my feet hanging off the side of the seat, when I was little. I was 7 years old and so small enough to do so. There is no reason why I would have been in the back seat. Further, in a front end collision, loose objects, including my 7 year old self, should have gone through the windshield. So how the fuck did I wind up in the back seat?!

My mum crushed her sternum, and I could see the foam inside it.

Around 1999 (when gas was $0.99 a gallon, like most gas stations, and was self serve.  Chris and I were talking about something when…


Directly between us a “portal” opened up for 1 second, in that they were not flashes, nor where they electrical in behavior. The intensity was like viewing a laser in the dark, and dropping bits of glitter through the beam, except this laser was white, and the glitter was infinitely small. Another odd property of this “line” was that the bits of white light seemed to travel downward in one direction, and where they stopped in mid-air was very abrupt. There was no phasing in or out.  Imagine taking an exacto knife to reality… It started and stopped without any warning.


At first we both said
“That white sparkle!”
“What did it look like?”
“It just started and stopped
“Where was it?”


He pointed to the same place I witnessed it too. We spent a couple minutes searching the area. At first I looked above us, almost no humidity. Chris and I drove to Tempe talking about this thing the whole trip. I was surprised it happened at a gas station because if it were electrical it might have been dangerous, but Chris and I both agreed it looked nothing like electricity or anything else we had ever seen.


I have searched for an explanation, fairies, etc. I’ve pondered if some kind of insect could produce something like this in a kind of web or such, but the intense light that came from the object is difficult to imagine. A laser beam seems to be the best idea, but a white one? And what would allow it to start and stop mid-air?

I looked in his file on our computer system and only found one client with his name (its a bit of an unusual name too, not going to provide it for obvious security reasons). 

In fact, so I checked our old file system and nothing. But I knew I had spoken with him, all the information in his file seemed like I'd seen it before. 

So then today happens and I am just lost. I KNOW I've filled out these forms with this man before. I knew his name, what doctors he'd been to. Everything. Everything we went over I knew we were going to go over, because I know I did these forms with him about 1 month ago.

You are Nothing. Not nothing as in you dont exist. No, as an infinite and definite source of space where there are no bounds. You see, but not with your eyes. You hear, but not with your ears. You feel, but not with your heart or mind. You are what you are seeing , you are what you are hearing, you are what you are feeling. Picture this in the exact way i have told you. 


**Part 1:**

I was an entity. The earliest memory i remember, and i find a connection to her. I can trust her.  I open my arms, and say 'Ana' which is Me in Arabic. She lifts me up and picks me up to see over the wall next to me, and i see goats sheep and chickens. The moment this incident happened. It happens again. Exactly as it did the first time. The only explanation i have is that, because this was the first experience in my life when i am old enough to remember, I lived the memory back, because it was all i had. 

When i was 6 years old one day


**Part 2:**

I am now 18 years old. I can recall that memory easily as being the earliest memory in my life. 
I asked my father one day if i had ever visited my grandparents back in Palestine (I am Palestinian). 
My father says to me: *'You were such an awkward kid. You were always a jumpy child. You could not sit down in a place. You had to be moving. You never knew where to go or what to do, around a year old, (Born in 1994, so 1995), and you would not leave your grandmothers side. Always asking to see the animals and always wanting to be in her arms. It reached the point you would want to spend more time with your grandmother than anyone else, including your mother.*

After confirming my first and second memory were real and happened, i emailed him, i sent him messages through his facebook and twitter. After two months, i finally got to talk to him. I needed to know how he was able to explain that feeling. That pure darkness of energy. After talking to him for 5 minutes about this, he told me, ""Keep remembering that first memory. Keep replaying it over and over and over and over. And focus alot on that beginning portion, that split millisecond of memory of darkness before the memory that always plays with the memory. Keep doing this until you fall asleep. (he mentions to do this before i sleep). Maybe something will trigger a previous memory. The Zero Memory......' The phone shuts. I have never been able to get in to contact with him in the last 6 months. That Zero Memory. I needed to know what it was. And so i did what he told me the following night. 


**Part 3:**

Repeat. Repeat. Repeat. Repeat. Repeat. Repeat. Repeat. Repeat. Repeat. Repeat. Repeat. Repeat. Repeat. Repeat. Repeat. Repeat. Repeat. Repeat. Repeat. Repeat. Repeat. Repeat. Repeat. Repeat. Repeat. Repeat. Repeat. Repeat. Repeat. Repeat. Repeat. Repeat. Repeat. Repeat. Repeat. Repeat. Repeat. Repeat. Repeat. Repeat. Repeat. Repeat. Repeat. Repeat. Repeat. Repeat. Repeat. Repeat. Repeat. Repeat. Repeat. Repeat. Repeat. Repeat. Repeat. Repeat. Repeat. Repeat. Repeat. Repeat. Repeat. Repeat. Repeat. Repeat. 
With every repetition of the memory, the actual movie. You feel what everyone feels. You think what everyone thinks. You are everyone. I could feel myself reliving the same words, the same actions, the same feelings over and over. It was like re-watching a movie over and over, you know what happens, but the feelings and understanding gets better and stronger each time i replay. It was like reading a book. You are bound to have skipped or overread or overlooked something, and when you re-read it
Then I fell asleep. But When you sleep you wake up afterwards right? When you sleep

**Part 4:**

I’m in darkness. I lift up my hands, they’re not there. It’s neither warm, nor cold. As I look around longer, I realize it’s not darkness I’m seeing, I am not seeing at all. The closest I can relate this feeling to, in our life, is like being a gas.  But I’m bounded. I’m held somewhere, there are no lights, and I can move in any direction I want, I repeated over and over. Wherever I moved in my blanket and wall of nothing and darkness
“I can’t wait until it’s my time. I can’t wait until its my turn. Im gonna be the greatest ever
This though repeats over and over. As I remained in my position, I wasn’t standing nor flying. There was nothing, and I was there.)
And……then
Suddenly

And I find myself, saying ‘ana, ana’ (Me, Me). 

**Part 5:**
 
My ears woke up before me. I found myself awake, as I realized I was breathing through a tube. Then the smell, It smelt like an old house.  Old people. That’s all I could think of. Then finally, my eyes awoke to light. It took time for me to recall my memories, my thoughts, and finally I remembered the zero memory. It hit me like a freight train. Suddenly I couldn’t breathe. I’m grasping for something, I’m struggling to stand up and run away. Something is not right. This is all not right. Why did I just recall an existence before my own? That could not have been true. It should not have been true. I should not have been able to remember that. The doctor in charge, screamed for something

**Part 6:** 
They awoke me slowly. It was a lot to take in. Everything they told me. But here it is everyone. The previous night was March 15. The next morning that I woke up was April 25. My parents tried to wake me up for my morning class, everything was off the charts. The prefrontal cortex showed my attention sensory systems were in use. The limbic system was showing that emotions were in high usage. The hippocampus, one of the parts of the brain, controls new memory was also in usage. However the doctors noticed there was a high neurotransmitter communications between the neurons in the hippocampus and the neurons in the Cerebral cortex. They found it frankly weird, and strange, almost as if I was remembering a dream that id previously forgotten. When he said that, that final statemnent, and cried. I don’t know why, I don’t know where we came from, but the only thing I can do

i was at the bottom floor of the WEST end. i looked at my clock. 11:49. there is a good 200 yards distance from my desk to the west end elevators. i could not have possibly walked the opposite direction from the cafeteria and not realized it. no way i would have made it that far in 1 minute

i was not sleep deprived or tired. i was not on any drugs or alcohol

i can't think of any other logical reasons this would happen. i know it isnt like i thought i saw 11:48 when i logged out and it was really 11:46 or 11:40 because i didn't get any incedent reports of taking a long break

I went to some kind of fair and saw a really long line for something in a tent that I couldn't see. I don't know why but I was drawn to this tent so I started walking to the back of the line. 

As I was walking by the front I saw this douchey guy( let's call him C) I knew from my senior year in high school. I'd moved the summer before my senior year and didn't have many friends. C was a total arrogant jerk who for some reason liked to make snarky comments about anything I said. When he sees me walking by he calls out to me and starts apologizing for the way he acted when we were in school. As I continued walking down the long line I passed one of my best friends (call him J) from high school (pre senior year). It had been a while since we talked so I hung out with him in line for a while catching up. After some time a couple people in line got angry and told me I had to go to the back. 

Finally I made it to the end of the line where 2 more people from my past were waiting. M was a girl I had known most of my life and had had a secret crush on since we had been kids (Call her M). M had gone to high school with me and J but she didn't know him. The other person was a guy I knew from junior high who I haven't seen or talked to in at least 6 years (we'll call him B). M

Now here's where it gets freaky. The day after I had the dream I got a message from C on Facebook (I have no idea why I was even friends with him). We start talking and he apologizes for the way he treated me in high school saying that he felt a little threatened by me because I was just as smart if not smarter than him in class. Then later that night I meet up with one of my coworkers to hang out. He says he's bringing his cousin with him. Turns out his cousin is J. We spend the night catching up and having a great time. By this point I'm feeling paranoid and freaked out but I keep telling myself it was just a weird coincidence. 

So then yesterday I log into Facebook and see I have a new friend request. Deep down I knew who it was gong to be but I still felt my heart sink when I see it's B. I've accepted his request but haven't talked to him yet. Finally I'm at the mall in GameStop preordering the PS4 when I feel a tap on my shoulder. When I turn around I see exactly the person I was expecting but it still surprised me to find myself face to face with M. I end up having lunch together and catch up. She's married now and has a kid.

Honestly I'm really freaked out by all of this and don't know what to think. 4 random people from my teenage years are in my dream and then within 2 days I interact with all of them. I haven't talked to any of them in at least a year yet now they have all recently been a part of my life.

I was on a backpacking trip in Yellowstone for 14 days with a camp. The trip had been going very well, had our breakfast, and began our hike.

We all decided to go off trail and bushwhack all the way up, but overall it was very safe. Anyway, after a few hours we made it to the peak, unluckily right as we peaked it, we heard thunder. We were above tree line which is not a good place to be when a thunder storm passes. So we all hauled ass to get back down to tree line.

Finally at tree line we stopped for our lunch, following a little creek all the way. Now it's important to note that we were planning on only being out for a day hike, big mistake. We were very unprepared, had no warm clothes, shorts and a light rain jacket all of us, no food, no light, nothing. After about 4 hours of wandering it was becoming pretty obvious we were lost

Panic was setting in to some of the campers, we hiked in the pitch dark for hours, stupidly crossing freezing rivers before we all decided to settle down and camp it out. We found a little opening in the woods and huddled into a big glob, we dubbed it, ""The Cuddle Puddle"". It did drop to what felt like at least freezing, being wet from the waist down probably didn't help, all I know was that I was on the outside of the puddle and distinctly remember loosing all feeling in my lower half during that night.

My girlfriend was watching me the entire time.  I figured I would post my results here so I can get input from you guys as to what just happened to me.

I specifically remember that when I was focusing on the water, I was outside the train.  After getting out and stepping onto the platform, I kept following his directions.  When he told me to look at the date, I saw two numbers: a 15 and an 1802.  When he said to look at my name, No month, though.  I couldn't read it

When I came to the door to open it, but then turned into a black door with very ornate carvings of creatures I had never seen before.

That's when I went through it (it took a lot longer than what he was going through) and I ended up in a valley.  There were cliffs, I was a stonemason.  The clothes I had on, though I never saw my hands or any part of my body, were what appeared to be some sort of large, loose-fitting robe-like garment with thick gold trim along the hem of the garment.  I saw that I had somehow ended up in a large stone building with a vaulted ceiling.  The stone was grey, but it had what appeared to be moss and vines on the stones.  After that, I pretty much let go and went much deeper.  I noticed I didn't have a body.  I realized this because I couldn't see myself when he had told me to look at myself in a mirror when I was back at the station.  I remember thinking that perhaps this was a place that was before time.

The next thing I remember is hearing part 2 of the session a second time, I saw myself in the mirror.  I looked like an Italian guy with a mustache and curly hair that kind of stuck out like a fro, but not quite that big.  I don't remember a date this time, though, nor a name.

I went to a different place this time.

This time, but at a much steeper angle and not on the side of a mountain.

Then I was walking around a city that looked as if it was of an advanced civilization that lived in harmony with nature.  Everything was thin and sleek, or like there was a dust storm going on.

Then as I moved into part 3, head-first down either a cliff or a well of some kind.  I was weightless and just sort of floating/flying there.

I never went back through the door.  I also remember that I was alone throughout the entire experience.  There was not a single person I saw outside of me (and even then, as if I was waking up out of REM sleep or something.

I was silent but loud, within what had become a thick soup of a physical world. Nurses walked by clearly slower than normal, my mind was almost waiting for more to happen for it to absorb. This lasted for around 2 to 3 minutes. 

As I grew older I put the experience down to by brain coming off of the anaesthetic after surgery

This time I was at university in the computer labs one night with a large group of course mates working on our projects, the same envelopment within a thickening time, the taking in of information at break neck speed the physical world slowly going about its business whilst I observed its beauty then the gradual release back into normalcy. No one seemed to notice me acting any differently, I just have no idea what it was. 

This time is ceased to be scary.

FYI I've had psych evaluations for job related reasons so it turns out I'm not crazy

I know it all sounds bizarre and probably unclear

I just got back from lunch with Bri

Bri picked me up from work so we could have lunch together, chatted about how our days had been so far, nothing serious yet about the party where all of this started, but she could tell something was biting at the back of my mind and simply asked, ""I know it's something Ryan, just tell me?"" I told her that I would once we finished our food and were back in the car, that I wanted to talk about it in private. We finished our food, I brought what happened up

I told her that a few nights ago, and then I added the second part. I told her that I had seen a bunch of cuts covering her mid section and that it really worried and freaked me out. She looked at me, equally as concerned and assured me that she wasn't covered in cuts, and lifted up her shirt enough to show me her stomach and back, and even showed me that her arms were clean of any cuts or marks outside of a bruise she had when she banged her arm on the counter at Amanda's party that was about to fade away. This made me feel a lot better and I was sure this was the end of things. Bri drove me back to work, hugged me and thanked me even for being concerned about her, and kissed me on the cheek before I got out of her car. Here's something weird though.. 

I just got back to my cubicle at work, but after that the last thing she remembered was seeing me rush downstairs in a panic looking for her. This confused the hell out of me.. I texted her back asking if she ever noticed Bri come downstairs without me, but she didn't recall. Amanda did however end up finding an orange puma sweatshirt up in her room that wasn't hers, and she hadn't gotten around to mentioning it to Bri yet, so she asked me to.

I'm sitting here at work, I'm going crazy, or if that night I really did just drink too much.  Any additional suggestions on this would be great, thanks guys.

1371652571.0,1gnnqe,Time traveled to the future just to watch a crappy movie.,Ninja_Please117,46,4,4,"My father had me for the weekend around when I was 7 and as per usual he took me to a movie theater on a Saturday afternoon. I distinctly remember this movie; it was Disney's Jungle 2 Jungle with Tim Allen. It was typical of a bad Disney 90's movie, went to Fuddruckers for dinner

About 6 months later

I told him about the dad weekend from a few months prior, then the hotel. He didn't recall it at all. He chalked it up to me being confused with the hundreds of other weekends, but when I started recalling the plot he became a bit more interested. I vividly remember sitting through the whole film, still trying to reconcile the fact the Tim Allen was NOT in fact Santa Clause, which at the time was my favorite Christmas movie. I remembered specific scenes and interactions, the characters names...everything. 

I've considered a few explanations:

1. I saw a preview and have a REALLY vivid imagination. The problem with this is that I clearly remember the afternoon, middle, and end. I'm sure my tiny brain could extrapolate a bigger story from the preview, but it seems unlikely.
2. My memory was playing tricks on me and I saw the movie much closer to the advertisement event than I had thought. This also assumes that the advertisement was out of date and it was just playing with my 7-yr old sense of time. This also assumes my dad just forgot we saw it (I'd want to forget too)
3. I am aware that this film is an adaptation of a French film *Un indien dans la ville* from a few years prior. To my knowledge I had never seen this, I just super imposed Tim Allen and that kid from that show into the story. 


Dad thought it was confusing

TL;DR: I time traveled to the future with my Dad to see a shitty Tim Allen movie only to return to my own time with complete knowledge of the plot

The nametag moved into her hand!""  I was stunned and said that I did.  He looked around at the other people at our table and asked if they saw it.  I asked others as well.  People thought that we were joking and left.  She chuckled and walked away.  He and I stood there

I had to ride back with her on the bus but I never mentioned it again.  Now I wish that I would have asked her about it in privacy

My friends and I would spend most of the time in the basement as we could be loud, obnoxious teenagers and anyone in the bedrooms upstairs couldn't hear us.  The middle floor had an open floor plan expect for one smaller room, which we dubbed the piano room (as it, uh, had a piano in it).  This room was adjacent and viewable from the front porch, but we mostly had heavy curtains drawn.  Since my parents worked a lot, sometimes for days at a stretch.

In the basement one afternoon, but not look, and said it was undeniably us.  After a few moments, the argument stopped, so she went about her business not to get involved.

Several other people left alone in the house had similar experiences.  And it was always noted as my mother and I.  I returned home once to find another friend pounding on the front door screaming for me.  When she saw my car pull up, she could make out silhouettes of two people.  No one was in the house at that time.  Freaked me out, too, considering the accounts from other friends (some of whom refused to believe in ""that sort of thing"").

One morning I clean both the bowls out before work. I leave each fish in it's cleaned bowl on the counter near each other but next to each other. I was picking up stuff to put in the bowls after work so that's why I left them on the counter.
After a long day of work I come home and when I walk in the kitchen I look at the bowls on the counter and there is no red fish. Blue fish is chillin' and the red fish is gone.

I search all around the inside of the fishbowl, Did it flop out of the bowl and flop 4 feet along the counter and slide inside the stove through the top? Doesn't seem possible but I search the whole stove, behind the stove (can't see how it would've made it behind there but just in case) and pull the stove out and there is no fish. The counter the fish were on was against the wall so there was nothing to slide behind. There is literally no where for this fish to have gone. It's not in the other bowl. It didn't flip out of it's bowl and into the air and over into the blue fish's bowl. There is no skeleton or anything of him being eaten by blue fish. But really there is no possible way that red fish even flipped his way into blue fish's bowl. I am grasping at straws though. The window of my city apartment is cracked a bit and not open wide enough for a bird to fly into the kitchen and onto the counter to scoop it out of the bowl and that is crazy also. I can't see a rodent coming in the window or out of the crevices to climb onto the counter and go into a bowl of water to get the red fish. The sink is not where the fish could get to without having to land on the floor first so he didn't slide in there and even if he did, the drain was covered with a protector thing that would stop him from sliding down the drain. No one had keys to my apartment including the super.
 I can literally think of no other (crazy) possibilities of what happened and I have tried to figure this from every angle over the years cause it's so weird to me.

While I was playing my parents went out to do the weekly food shop and we had very recently had a new 40"" TV downstairs. So as nobody was in I thought it would be cool to play it on the huge TV. 

I specifically remember turning off the TV and N64 then turning them off at the socket - i had a sign my dad wrote on paper on the wall reminding me to turn things off. 

I unplugged the nintendo and took it downstairs and had a good hour or so playing it before my parents came back so i saved and turned off the n64 and started unplugging it to go back upstairs to play some more.

My dad went upstairs and shouted down that I had left my TV on 'again' and I said I was coming - I grabbed all the bits and went upstairs confused as to why my TV was on when I turned it off at the socket.
 
The TV was on and displaying static

I showed my dad and he seemed a bit weirded out too as I had the n64 in my hand totally unplugged in the end we turned the tv off and went downstairs.

This happened to me when I was either 12 or 13 (I'm now 21) but I know I'll never forget this. I was eating dinner with my family at a seafood place. You know those places that give you plastic bibs with lobsters on them and the whole nine yards. They also give you wooden mallets with every place mat for a fun way to open your seafood dinner. Apparently (and I don't remember the reason why because it's irrelevant) I had pissed off my little brother enough that he took his mallet and beamed me with it as hard as he could in my arm. My entire body ceased up, like you'd seen in a movie theater. As my body floated in this pitch black theater-like room I realized the screen had suddenly turned on and was flickering a home move styled feature, except it wasn't some Hollywood blockbuster, it was my entire life being played on the screen before my very eyes. And I mean everything, birthdays sleep overs, the first time I road a bike. It was literally all there. If your thinking ""well that must have taken a long time to watch all that footage from all the years you had lived up until that moment"" your damn right. It literally felt like I was in this state for several years (at least). Each major stage of my life the movie screen would turn black and I would be left floating in the dark for what felt like hours and then suddenly adjacent to the one id just been watching would flicker to life  and under no control of my own I would float over it. This marked another, I guess we'll call it another, not really able to understand why the hell i was laying on the floor and also because of the whole pre death experience. My dad then told me that I had fallen off my chair after slumping like a sack of potatoes onto the table. But there I was laying on the floor of the restaurant with all the patrons staring at me probably thinking I was mentally retarded for falling out of my chair and onto the dirty ground. Of course it was a bit embarrassing to have all those people staring at me but I was also so creeped out by the entire thing because what felt like an enormous amount of time had literally been no longer than the time it took for gravity to plop me on the ground from the distance of a normal sized chair.

About two weeks ago I had this incredibly vivid dream, I have a pretty  vivid dream and I can usually remember most of them to this day. This particular dream takes place  in the past, maybe ten years ago or so at my grandparents house, where occasionally one side of my family congregates just to get together with everyone. I was hanging out outside in the late afternoon with my father and brother and we were playing catch with something, a football or something similar. I went inside to grab something to drink where maybe 8 or so of my other family members were hanging out. When I went inside I noticed a man sitting on the white leather couch in the living room, and I just stood there shocked. It was Wilson. He is my uncle. His appearance was so distinct in my dream, he had black work boots on, and a black Carhartt jacket. This was a peculiar look for my mom's side of the family, that Wilson dressed this way. Déjà vu in a dream?  
 
Now, but hadn't shown up anywhere or been talked about for over a decade. At first I thought it was just lingering side effects from the dream, but throughout the last two weeks, memories began surfacing of other family activities where he was present. I remember him in places which never occurred in the dream I had. I can see him there, I remember what he was like, how he interacted with other family members, what he wore

 After the house was done, nobody else in the house had done so either. When me and my buddy walked in to start cleaning it out, I was surprised at how well the place had held up over the years, especially my parents old room. While the rest of the apartment was beginning to become slightly dingy with age, their old room looked like no one had ever left it. The bed was still made with sheets that were clean, the desk in the corner still had a legal pad and pen still sitting on the table as if someone had recently been taking notes. I assumed that my parents had bought this furniture just for temporary purposes and had simply left it there when we moved into the new house. The thing that fascinated me the most however about this room were the walls.

The walls were covered almost floor to ceiling with pencil drawn art. Most of these pictures were of nude women while others were of other varieties

Well the next day, I noticed immediately that something was different. The whole place seemed to have aged vastly since the previous day, and layers of dust that had not been there the day before now covered nearly every surface. When I opened the door to my parents old room, I stopped in shock. The room was completely bare. The bed that had been ready for someone to sleep in had been stripped to the frame.

1372450928.0,1h9qv4,Saw an earthquake an hour before it hit,SecretAgentMan_007,52,11,17,"Back in the summer of 2011 I started getting interested in the science of mind and consciousness.  I had just watched the movie 'The Men Who Stare at Goats' for the first time on dvd and the line at the beginning of the movie intrigued me.  It said ""More of this is true than you would believe.""

So I started researching remote viewing on the internet.  I even got a few books on the subject from the local library.  One of the consistent things I read from multiple sources was that the key to unlocking your mind's own intuitive abilities was to practice meditation with the intention to do so.  At first I was kind of scared to.  I mean

Some time passed and I just researched the subject from the sidelines without actively working to see what I might be capable of doing myself.  This changed when my 1.5 year old daughter at the time started having trouble sleeping.  She was acting like she was perceiving things or people that my wife and I were unaware of.  I had watched enough of the 'Ghost Hunters' television shows to wonder if I wasn't getting some warning signs that we had a visitor.

Now motivated by my parental desire to protect my child

I had been meditating for maybe a week or two (every day after I would get home from work).  It was 23 August 2011 and I was walking to a neighboring building at work to go to a meeting.  I was in the lobby of my building and it was completely empty.  There were no other people there.  As I walked toward the main door suddenly in my mind's eye I saw everything around me violently shaking and I immediately thought 'earthquake!'  It was strong and abrupt.  It lasted maybe 5 seconds before I shook it off.  Although it was strong

I really didn't know what to think of it.  I sort of shook it off and walked outside and crossed the street to go into the building where my meeting was.  While I was in my meeting

I had a few more smaller experiences after this that really validated some things to me but I didn't know what to do.  I really couldn't talk to anybody without them telling me I was crazy or at a minimum just looking at me with a blank stare not knowing what to say.  I actually did a web search in my area and found a meetup group for people to talk about psychic phenomenon and they did group meditations.  They really helped save my sanity because I found a group of people who were open and understanding in that subject area and even had experience to speak from.  

I actually ended up meeting a rather gifted individual there who was a trained medium.  I had him over for dinner to check out my house because of the sleep issues my daughter was having.  He ended up doing a clearing to help 3 visitors 'cross over.'  I was still new to this all and was becoming more open minded

The old man's instructions' were correct and my parents found themselves on the trail again. Now the rain was getting heavier, they decided to head to the top as it wasn't too far.

By the time they reached the top it was raining hard and the sun had set. There was no one in sight at the gondola station but it was still running. They got in the next gondola that arrived and made the journey to the bottom of the mountain. When they arrived the bottom gondola station was unoccupied as well. They got out on their own and left the building.

It was my senior year of high school. Every day I ate lunch with my close friends at the time. One of these friends has been my best friend for a long time

One night, I sent Pat a text message asking him if he thought the group would be interested in going. I ended up at the carnival later in the dream, but I'm not sure if my friends were with me at all. Pat never responded to the text message.

The next thing I remember is waking up and getting out of bed. As usual, so I just put the phone down and walked to the shower. It was when I was in the shower that I remembered the dream. As soon as I dried off, I went to check my phone. Nothing in the prior text conversation would have agreed with that response, and here was the really weird part: no date or time on the message. All I could see was that it was from Pat.

Of course I asked Pat about it as soon as I saw him that morning, and he claimed to have no knowledge of sending the message.

I have a few ideas about what happened. I'm always pretty skeptical, or the lack of time or date on the message. I wonder if it was a message floating around from before that never successfully sent, but I know nothing about the technology of cellphones, and towers, and such (if anyone does know anything please chime in!).

I would love to believe that the Pat from my dream sent me a text message that made it out of my head

I left this house four and a half years ago, depending on the period, as others moved in or out while I was there. There were two separate incidents of a very similar nature which freaked me out at the time: I saw what appeared to be solid, living versions of a housemate's friend and my then girlfriend, while they were actually elsewhere in the house.

I've made a little floorplan to give you an idea of the layout

The first was Jen. She was, slim, Scottish lady, with short, dyed-auburn hair. She would often come over and in summer, my housemate, Marie, talking to them and eating, past Andy's room, and a narrower passage through the door to get into the room. Next to this gap was Jen

Jen and Tony could see from my face that there was something wrong - and we were the only four in the house.

The other occasion was following a late trip to the cinema with my girlfriend at the time, we walked in and I immediately made for the upstairs bathroom, leaving Kate to walk into my room, immediately to the left of the hall, before the stairs. This was unusual for two reasons: we had a small, downstairs WC between Andy's room and the kitchen, opposite the understairs cupboard, which is strange as I hate the dark. Always have.

On this occasion, too. When I walked into my bedroom, expecting Kate to be there, she was not and the lights were still off. I went looking for her. I walked straight down the hall toward the back of the house, and saw her in the kitchen, in the dark - lit by the moon and streetlights, through a large external window above the sink. She turned away from the sink to the counter on the opposite wall

I started talking to her. And then within a pace or two

I called her name. Nothing. I called her name again. Nothing. I asked where she was. And then I heard her voice.

She was in the WC - obviously, so that she could not have moved from the kitchen into the WC without obstructing my view into the kitchen. And I saw her clearly, as real as I can see my housemate sitting in the chair across the room from me now.

Marie walked in the front door as I was calling Kate's name. She witnessed my genuine shock

So, I physically touched the person and I struggle to put that down entirely to imagination.

There was one night that I was particularly busy so I decided to go the following morning to get my work done before the school opened. So its about 6 am and I am taking the trash out of one of the classrooms. As I'm standing in the hallway and I hear footsteps at the other end of the hallway. I turn and see a tall, the two of them smiled and took a sharp left into the classroom they were walking by. I wasn't afraid but I was concerned with how they got into the building and what the hell they were doing here. So I made a b-line for the classroom and I found it empty. There are doors that connect each of the classrooms so I checked the surrounding rooms but couldn't find them at all. By this time I'm starting to get a little freaked out so I finished up my work as quickly as possible and got out of there. I didn't tell anybody about this because I thought it might have been in my head or I was going crazy.

I unclipped my phone and looked and there was no history of the calls at all.

There I was put on medication and while still a  bit manic and confused, he told me he felt a terrible restriction in his breathing like he was being choked and felt he was about to die. Enter another person, let's call him Y. A few minutes after X told me this story and we had returned to the main area of the ward Y approached us clearly and visibly shaken. He wanted a word with us. There he explained that he could overhear our conversation, that he had been in the room at the time near his bed but his curtains were drawn so we didn't see him. At the time of X and I's conversation, Y, who suffers from chronic depression was attempting to strangle himself with a cord. He pulled down his jumper to us and showed us the cord mark around his neck. He claimed that he was passing in and out of consciousness, where he could hear X talking about a restriction of breathing and a feeling of being choked and when he was fading he found himself having a lucid experience where he was in a meadow, then I'd love to hear you guys and girls perspective on it.

I was on the beach at Ocean City, but much more athletic, was already able to get into the water and do what he wanted but I was not very confident because the waves were too strong for me.  This time, however, I wanted to follow my brother as far as I could and see what I was missing.  I walked out into the edge water, which was only inches deep, maybe to my ankles.  For some reason, and then started waving.  I could see their mouths moving

You already know that they were trying to tell me a big wave was coming and to get out of the water.  But I didn't understand until the wave knocked me down.

It was probably not all that big a wave for a normal sized person, I was knocked over again.  My head never got out of water.  I hadn't taken a deep breath so I was soon out of oxygen and my lungs started to hurt.  I probably made this worse by thrusting my legs and flailing.  I was trying to jump from the bottom so that I'd break the surface, but I was disoriented and never was standing up, so I just pushed myself along sideways.  Finally, my lungs couldn't take it anymore.  I knew it wasn't possible to breathe underwater but I couldn't stop myself from taking a big breath.  I felt like I was underwater, but somehow, I got air.

Then there is a blank spot.  At the time, then nothing, then I'm walking out of the water.

I know that I was pushing with my legs in the time before I took the breath, while my parents berated me for not paying attention to the waves.  I didn't understand what had happened.  I didn't even know how to tell my parents about it, so I never did.

To this day I don't know what happened.  But it was the first in a long series of strange events in my life.

I wasn't carrying an umbrella so I started rushing home when I saw a mother pushing a baby stroller looking happy and dry in the sun. She didn't notice there was rain on my side. When I reached home and looked back, the pavement was all dry except for the path I had walked. It was almost as if I was literally getting rained on by a tiny cloud, like a cartoon.

We ended up on a field where forces of evil, Sam wakes up gasping.

To be quite honest with you, he had the bewildered yet oddly vacant eyes of a man who just witnessed a car crash. If this was a performance, his commitment to the craft was worthy of at least a SAG award.

After a few minutes he was not amused that I was so matter of fact about the nature of nightmares

Mike's entrance was a welcome distraction. Soon enough we were talking about curls and push-ups and girls and bras. Mike, Sam pulled his back in horror. He jumped up and shrieked: ""Look!""
He was pointing to a scar on the inside of his forearm, light pink in color, two inches wide and less than an inch tall, shaped sort of like an elongated diamond.

We looked at him

""So""?

""This is where I was wounded in my dream""!

I was finally able to watch it around 1am (being on school holidays) with everyone else asleep.

[Planck Length](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planck_length) is, the smallest measurable area in existence. Things that are a shorter distance apart than that? They occupy the same space. Literally, distance just stops existing at those levels.

From this we get [Planck Time](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planck_time), time just stops existing at that interval. If two events happened less than a Planck time apart, they happened at the same time, literally, identically.

Now, logically, that shouldn't matter, they still shouldn't exist. And given the mind-boggling concept of infinity, there should be a literally infinite number of possible moments between them. But no.

These are dimensions of space and time below which the laws of physics just *stop*.

Does that remind you of anything? The pixels on a computer screen

On your monitor, hence processor speeds). The screen compensates with anti-alias blurring and 29.97s flickering, but it's an optical illusion. Sure, things can move more than one pixel per frame, but if it's animated well enough, your brain doesn't notice it, just like your brain edits out [saccades](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saccade).

I got out my map and showed him the address I was looking for. As I'm pointing at the map, I notice the X that I had noticed earlier. It seemed to be the exact location at which I was talking to this man. I thought that was pretty weird and I wondered what this guy might be thinking about some stranger parked out in his back yard in a plain white van, approaching him and apparently having his address marked on the map.

After graduating and moving out of state for a new job, except for one thing.

To this day the only game consoles in that house belonged to me. I even called my gamer buddy from before to confirm that I didn't just forget buying another.

Last July in 2012 we had new neighbors move in next door to where I live.

One day while coming home I see a tree in their front yard, I searched pictures I took, maps, and everything and yet there it was...as it had apparently always been. Except I walked through this yard in that spot and had NEVER ran into such a tree. Very disorienting to me but it was not the first time it had occurred.

Two years prior to that (2010 - late autumn) A good friend of mine and I had went walking through a placed called the Old Hawk Lake Golf Course which was since abandoned and turned into public walking trails. We took a path that went along side where a grocery store set just behind some trees; upon getting over a small hill we noticed a building sitting on the golf course, and an old toilet. We joked about how people probably used the toilet still as it stank badly and I remarked how odd it was that the building was still standing, it was fairly large and had a parking lot for golf carts out front. We continued our walk and decided to come back but neither he nor I could find the building. Instead we found a concrete slab with broken glass everywhere, misc. junk, and a pipe about where the toilet would have been. And it looked like the building had been a really long while and would have taken a work crew at least a few days to clean up but when we had seen it at least 45min prior it was very much there.

Summer of 2011 I was on vacation with friends in Madrid, and a few of my friends volunteer to be the picture takers that night, so I put my camera, ipad, passport, and some cash in the hotel safe. After a bad experience with housekeeping in Rome, it has been a habit of mine to set up my macbook with the screen turned off, and I want to take my camera with me to the palace (and other touristy places) but it's not there. I got way too excited about knowing that I must have caught the perp on my macbook

Here's where it gets tricky... I scan through the 7ish hours of footage, passport, and cash are still there exactly as I left them, just without my camera on top. I literally tore out that curly fake plastic ""carpet"" lining of the safe, and inspected it very thoroughly to ensure that there was no secret door or crap like that - everything checked out. I searched the room, but nothing, and checked with the lost and found at the front desk as well. I didn't end up finding my camera in the last sweep of the room before I checked out a few days later either

I arrive back home, and I asked my housemates if someone had mailed it back after finding it (After my first loss, I keep a locked picture with a P.O. box address that my house shares on the memory card) But to my surprise, they said that no such package ever arrived. Confused, I examine the camera and it's definitely mine, it had the same small scratch in the corner of the screen.

A few days later, they're nowhere to be found, and now there's only photos from before the trip on the memory card on the camera. I use Aperture to manage my photos, but the event I created for it was gone, nothing was in the trash of either aperture or osx, I tried using the recover database feature but the program didn't find any discrepancies. At this point I'm shaking a little, I call up my friends and ask if they remember me taking pictures

Now I don't even know what to think, nobody has access to my laptop but me) I chalked it up to too much booze and thinking I had my camera when in reality I was in charge of a friend's, and I download all the photos that everyone else took. As I'm going through them, my stomach drops - someone had taken a picture of me taking a picture - with my camera. Out of over a thousand photos, there is only one, but that one was enough. So now I have proof that my camera was indeed with me in Madrid.

I still don't know what happened there

Oh but wait, South Africa, in May 2012. I left my camera on my friend's nightstand with my passport and wallet, and went to the living room that was directly across the hallway.

When we decided that we all wanted to go out, I go in to grab my camera and wallet, but only my wallet is there. I mentioned I thought I had left it right there to my friend, and also the front door and gate. The next morning, and as I'm waiting at the gate

I couldn't believe this was happening again, I manage to recover all my photos (only the South Africa ones) using the database repair tool. I get home, no camera, but I'm holding out hope that it has appeared somewhere that I haven't looked yet. 

TL;DR Locked camera in hotel safe in Spain, camera went missing, but footage shows nobody entered the room. Scrutinized the safe but everything checked out. Searched the room and asked housekeeping / front desk but nothing. Got home and found my camera in my desk drawer. Tried to upload photos to shared folder on dropbox, but all photos on macbook are gone, recovery efforts failed, no photos from the trip on the memory card either. Thought I dreamed bringing my camera since we partied so hard and so much, but found a photo that a friend took clearly showing me taking a picture with my camera. Fast forward about a year and it goes missing under equally strange (and secure) circumstances on vacation in South Africa. Pictures went missing again, but the camera is still missing. I think it is somewhere I haven't looked yet.

There is so much potential for this subreddit to be a place of discussion and sharing experiences; theories and anectdotes rather than empty comments. Also I think skeptics here,' be more open minded and willing to look into alternative explanations/theories. On the other hand I also dislike it when made up theories lead to speculation. I'm ok with making up theories with evidence/ sources to back it up but not ambigious ones.

1374599031.0,1iw7nh,The Yellow Sign,The_Queen_in_Yellow,43,10,3,"Robert W. Chambers' *The King in Yellow* was one of my earliest literary influences in horror, Danielewski, the Pacific isles

*The King in Yellow* is a collection of short stories vaguely revolving around a play of the same name which, but needless to say, it's a delightfully creepy 1890s cosmic horror story that deeply affected in a significant way.

I owned a somewhat old copy of the book; it was nothing antique but not what one might refer to as brand new, I might set a CD case on top of the book.

I had started reading the book again at some point. While the car was a nice place to keep the book, unlocked it (even in a middle class suburban neighbourhood like mine, it was always a good idea to lock the car doors), and picked the CD cases off of the book. The bottom CD case was wet. This was somewhat alarming. What was more alarming was that the book was also wet. 

The book was also dirty. It was smeared in dirt and dead leaves, itself, was the source. The CD cases on top were also perfectly dry. It was only the bottom one that was wet and dirty, and only where had been touching the book.

This was all pretty disconcerting on its own, just... I don't know, little bugs). That was the proverbial straw which made me finally get rid of a book for the first time. However, not immediately.

I left the book in the garage to show to a friend. I occasionally see things like this that aren't real, I received the confirmation and the aforementioned friend concurred with my analysis re: that's creepy as hell.

I don't know if I can believe in such folly as supernatural forces or ""glitches, I'm not sure what that explanation would be. The wetness could be from a spilled drink that somehow avoided The dirt and leaves were nowhere else in the car and, being underneath other things, there's no real way they could have migrated into the book if the book was left where it was. The fact that the mess was specifically focused on the book is also bizarre as it suggests that the book was dirtied elsewhere and returned to the car (which, I reiterate, was locked).

About 7 years ago, but his funeral was in Houston (East Texas). My friend's dad decides to drive us there and me and two other friends make the trip. We were about 15-16 at the time, so we couldn't drive ourselves that far. We go to the funeral and then my friend's dad takes us to eat. We eat at a Whataburger in Houston and this is where the story really begins.

We eat our burgers and when we're getting ready to leave, we go out to the car and look for it everywhere there. Still can't find it. Back inside the restaurant, we search one last time at our table. After about 20-30 minutes of searching for it everywhere, he decides to just forget about it. We suggest that he may have left it at the graveyard or at the family's house, but he insists he had it with him at Whataburger and he had shown us something on it, so we all agree he lost it there or it was stolen.

We drove off anyway to head back home, because I never have been able to sleep during car rides. I'm sitting in the back driver's side seat and leaning my head on the window, when my friend's dad decides to stop at a gas station just south of San Antonio (South Central Texas, about 200 miles from Houston) for some coffee. He parks and about two parking spots down I see it. It's the same phone! I get out of the car right behind my friend's dad and I pick it up. One of my friends wakes up as I get in the car and I don't say anything. I didn't assume it was his phone, but it was the same model and color. It was off, so I turn it on before waking up my friends or saying anything. I figured I'd try to call someone and let them know that I'd be leaving the phone at the counter of the gas station. When the phone turns on, I see my friend's welcome message! Naturally, but I understand it's hard to believe. My friend's dad didn't see me pick it up

1364704322.0,1bcd95,I was staying at a cottage the key mysteriously moves,EnergeticBanana,49,15,5,"This happened about four or five years ago while I was at a family reunion.  We were celebrating my grandparents 50th wedding anniversary.  All my family had decided to stay together at a country resort in some cottages.  These cottages were large and all of family could stay in two of them.  The cottages were like a large house which was divided into different rooms like a hotel.  These cottages were old and since there was other people near by in at the resort we had to lock the door when we weren't home.  The key to door the door was a typical house key

We were all outside having a BBQ and I had to use the bathroom.  I get one of the only two keys from my Mom to open our part of the cottage.  My Dad had the other key.  I always put the key on the kitchen table so I wouldn't lose it and it would be easy to grab on the way out to lock the door again.  So using the bathroom I think about how maybe I should have brought the key in with me so I could just leave and not stop at the kitchen table.  I had pictured where I left it on the table (I was pretty bad about losing stuff so I wanted to make sure it was safe.  I didn't want to be the one to lose the key and then force my family to pay extra money to have another key made for our room) and looked out the window.  I was still thinking about how it would be nice if the key was closer but I knew I'd just have to pick it up where I always left it on the table.  When I finished using the toilet I looked over at the counter of the bathroom, actually thinking if I had brought it into the bathroom, I would have placed it there.  After finishing in the bathroom I take the key which somehow ended up in the bathroom with me.  I leave our cottage and go back to the BBQ weirded out.  I ask my Dad if he had the other key and he said yes and then I gave my Mom back the key I'd used which had somehow transported itself in the bathroom from the kitchen.  Never told anyone else this at the reunion because I knew no one would believe me.

It was during the summer, or were playing hacky sack.  Now that I think of if, we were standing to close to have just hacked.  I think we were done smoking, and standing around smoking cigarettes, talking.

As we are standing there, nor was it making any noise as you would expect from a helicopter.

(Before I go any farther, you know that you don't just start seeing shit.  Our whole group smoked quite a bit for a couple years, and we were all still pretty with it even after smoking a lot.  I try to tell people the story and they just say ""oh dude you were so high haha.""  But that is not what has happening.)

So we all see this object flying over us, is that it was easy to see the object against the sky, but it was still dark enough for the next part to be relevant.

As we look at it coming toward us, constant light coming toward us.

Right when it flies over us - much lower than a plane would be - the object shined a light down onto us.  It didn't drag a spotlight across the pavement, and a pitch-blackness, and an almost infinite brightness; and in such a clear distinction.  The line was not blurred.  It was pencil-thin.  It was such an impossibility for a light to shine from such a height and not blend at all.  You would expect, based on how bright the light was in the circle, that the entire parking lot would be bright for 100 feet.  But that wasn't the case. Long story short, even if someone was pranking us, or it was a mechanical disfunction

After it happened, ""am I going crazy.""

""Did anyone else see that...?"" someone said with a genuine confusion.  We all kinda looked at each other and slowed nodded

I often (every 1-2 weeks) have ""visions"" or ""flash-forwards"" where I'll just be day dreaming or something and just for a fleeting moment a scene that seems to be from the near future will cross my mind.

I played piano for around 8 years as a child and I didn't enjoy it. The skills and knowledge I have now, I did not enjoy having to practice my piano songs every morning for 20 minutes before school.

I don't want to bore you so basically what happened was one morning I woke up normal time with the alarm clock and my favourite radio station news to confirm the time. (just before 7am)

Soon after the shower and breakfast

I used to count every minute of that 20 minute practice every morning. That's how much I despised being forced to practice something I didn't really enjoy.

Then this one morning I was practising the piano and my father came out in a disorganised state (very unusual for a long term Army person)

It was 8:12am and I'd been practising for nearly an hour.

He was trying to tell me I'd be late for school but I was so astounded that I'd been practising for an hour that I was stunned listening to him try to tell me what time it was. I kept checking the clocks around the house.

The concept of me playing for that long when I hated doing it and I usually counted every minute of the 20 minutes

To this day I don't know what happened but somehow both my father and I lost nearly an hour of time and we don't know how. (I don't talk to him and haven't for a long time so we've never discussed this)

Little back story: I grew up in a working family, and deeply effected me for years.  I became more or less a shut in and deal type of coping mechanism.  All of the items I inherited from him were packed away in an attic box.

Fast forward a couple years, I retired to my bedroom and cried a lot.  I missed him and events involving the church brought back memories more than anything else.  I started to say my evening prayers like every other night the way he and my parents had me do . . . but it was the first time that I reached out to him, rather than 'God'.  An overwhelming calm came over me at that point and I fell asleep.  The next morning I woke up and went to go about my day when I moved to get out of bed something poked me in the side.  It was a crucifix that he left for me, one of his most prized possessions from one of his visits to Jerusalem.  I checked and nothing was disturbed in the attic or the closet with the attic access.  The dust was untouched on the box it was kept in.  

Ever since that night I've been able to overcome every one of my fears and gain an almost super human (compared to the way I felt before that) clarity of mind by simply thinking to myself 'Grandpa, I don't consider it a religious experience, rather a profound and still unexplained life changing experience.  Every time I think of it the same feeling washes over me, the physical feeling is similar to the chill you get when you feel dread or fear . . . but the mental feeling that comes with it is a completely calm sense of clarity - the opposite of fear.",,False,,False,t3_of3j5

Two years ago after recently moving to Florida I had a friend I grew very close to. We would be comfortable sharing some dark secrets with each other and me and him were both big paranormal freaks so it worked out. 

Well, he started running. Cause we were both starting to get creeped out with what we were saying he was trying to prank me. So this is what happens.

As I was running behind him for a second he didn't even look back so I planned to scare him so I see this bushy looking area with tall grass and I jump into it before he stops and turns around to come look for me. So I sit there crouched, I know where you are, I can see you."" I don't know why but I say it out loud cause I felt he wouldn't figure out where I was from my voice so I yell out, ""Where am I?"" So what he does is looks straight into the middle of the woods and points and moves his finger as if he was pointing at me while I was running. 

I was confused so I say ""Dude?"" and step out from where I was. He stood still for a second and he sprinted all the way to my apartment without saying anything I just followed him. As soon as we went into my room I had asked him what had happened and he told me that he had seen me. He said that he saw me running trying to hide from him and whenever I had stepped out he went pale because he ended up seeing another me running even though I was sitting behind a bush the entire time.

That led to a conversation about doppelgangers and parallel universes etc... until this day I don't really know what that was but it freaks me out and I'm sure it freaks him out too. We haven't talked about it since.

That night, it was gone and no amount of searching could turn it up.  I left band camp, and gradually forgot about the ring.  Now would be the time to mention that at the time, I could not drive, nor did I have a car.  Later that year, I was cleaning it out.  I pulled out one of the floor-mats and lo and behold



Last year, and I usually prefer it.  From where I was sitting, I couldn't see the kitchen.  I heard what sounded like a lot of pots falling out of the cabinet.  I automatically assumed my dogs had gotten into the cabinet.  I went to go check.  All of the cabinets were closed, and there were no pots on the floor.

What if reality shifts in the time continuum are not just a local phenomenon but more so controlled by something, they control time. They don't control how time moves but they control how they move within it. Often you will place you car keys down in a spot and they vanish, for minutes at a time. You spend this time loosing your mind over what happened, then they either appear right where you last put them or they get moved. Sometimes I think the Time Gremlins move the items to delay your progress, either for malicious purpose or to help you. Sometimes your delay will cause you to come upon an intersection with a car crash in it, that could have been you, but the Time Gremlins saved you allowing another person fate to meet that incident. But sometimes that delay will cause you to be late, those are the malicious Time Gremlins. Could there even be Time Gremlins that are at war with each other? Ones that help us move through time and ones that want us to crash and burn. We will never know until we catch one, more so like a virus in the matrix.",t5_2tcwa

I hadn't scraped my foot or cut it or anything but it started to bleed, between leaving the house and walking in, they stopped appearing.

Well the book wound up on my bookshelf collecting dust over time as books do between readings.  Just this past week, and it is no longer bound upside down.  It's just a normal Hitch Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy, bound properly.  I have multiple people who can vouch for this book being bound upside down at one point.
