**About the list**   

My intention was to create a list of shows that fans of the Wire might enjoy. Sort of an optimized version of: ""If you liked The Wire

At the beginning of the list, or both. Immediately following is a list of highly praised shows suggested by the community of /r/TheWire. The order was created by the level of praise each show received either here or in general.   

If you would like to see the discussion that brought it about

As any new shows come about or any changes in netflix or hbogo occur, and I hope this list can be of some use for someone experiencing those post-Wire blues.    ",,False,self,t5_2reco,False,,

I figure there was probably an older thread discussing this, I figure it would have been more accessible to do the politics in Season 2 (not that I expect Simon to have cared about popular appeal).

There's a number of things for the faint-hearted or first time viewers to know about The Wire before you jump in:

1. There is no denouement, NCIS, or any other typical police drama. On the contrary, The Wire is the epitome of the ""slow build"", it takes episodes to get started, much less finished. As in life, there are rarely any easy, The Wire is all gray.

2. There is not a simple, rather than escape. Redemption and revenge are possible, but not in one episode or one season. The Wire requires patience.

3. There are no clear cut heroes and villains (this is the anti-""Heroes"" tv show.) There are only human beings, is an alcoholic who cheats on his wife. Even Marlowe, the apparently soulless villain, grapples with very human issues of loyalty and pride.

4. Though there are great, the city, is a central character, the abiding presences in The Wire are Baltimore's institutions and organizations: courts, city government, educational system, labor unions, newspapers. Even gangs are seen as just another organization. Unlike any other show I've ever seen

That's only a start. There's more that makes The Wire a challenge for viewers: it's non-linearity (it's more like a spiral), etc., etc.

All that said, is a transcendent, moving experience. However downbeat it's subject matter, it is, in the end, a true work of art, a masterwork,,False,t3_s40m7

So my question is: Why?

Obviously the shows are about different characters and different scenarios, since BB follows a *much* smaller cast, which would seem to suggest a deeper connection.) 

Here's what I've come up with on my own:

* BB revolves around some pretty unlikely coincidences. I won't go into spoilers for the benefit of those who haven't seen it

* I'm finding a *lot* of similarities between Walter White and Don Draper (from Mad Men). They're both egomaniacs who regularly do things for very opaque reasons. This makes them harder to like than, but McNutty somehow redeems himself in ways that the other two don't. I feel like AMC shows are more willing to lurk in the weird shadows of human uncertainty, whereas HBO shows (I'm thinking also of Oz and The Sopranos) confront scenarios in a more factual head-on style.

* BB doesn't really deal with social issues like TW does. Once in a while we'll get a passing view of the arbitrary nature of the law

**Books**:

* *Homicide: A Year on the Killing Streets* (1991)

David Simon's book that started it all. Follows Baltimore homicide detectives through 1988 as they roam the streets of Baltimore. Also provides great glimpses into the bureaucratic hell that is the Baltimore City Police Department. People who love ""The Wire"" ***need*** to read this book as it contains dozens of references to the show as well as giving a provocative insight to the life of a homicide detective.

* *The Corner: The Corner: A Year in the Life of an Inner-City Neighborhood* (1997)

David Simon and Edward Burns' first collaboration and a harrowing account of the slow decline of Baltimore. Follows the touts, community activists, and people who make West Baltimore their home. The book mostly follows the McCullough family who were torn apart by drug addiction. Also a must read for those who love ""The Wire"" as the book explains how Baltimore became a ghetto and how the drug dealing game evolved (as well as numerous references to The Wire... PANDEMIC! DIAMOND IN THE RAW!). DeAndre McCullough would later portray Lamar (Brother Mouzone's assistant) in ""The Wire."" 

* *Clockers* (1992)

Fictional story involving drug dealers and cops in a (fictional) New Jersey city. Mostly follows drug dealer Ronald ""Strike"" Dunham and homicide detective Rocco Klein. Worth a read.

* *Gomorrah* (2006)

The book goes into the underground world of the Camorra, he received death threats and is now in hiding with help of the Italian government. 

* *Donnie Brasco: My Undercover Life in the Mafia* (1997)

Joseph D. Pistone's autobiographical account of his FBI work against the Bonanno family

* *There Are No Children Here: The Story of Two Boys Growing Up in the Other America* (1991)

I'll admit I haven't finished this one yet but it's still a good read so far. True account of two brothers living in the Henry Horner Homes of Chicago's poverty stricken ghettos.

**Movies**:

* Snow on tha Bluff (2012)

After robbing three college students during a drug deal

* Gomorrah (2008)

Roberto Saviano's book that was brought to the screen. Nothing short of excellent.

* City of God (Cidade de Deus) (2002)

One of the best movies ever made but I have a feeling only a few of you guys have seen this one. Follows the beginnings and evolution of gangs in Rio De Janeiro's ""Cidade de Deus"" suburb. I really can't state just how phenomenal this movie is. 

* Donnie Brasco (1997)

Johnny Depp plays Joseph D. Pistone and Al Pacino as his friend Benjamin ""Lefty"" Ruggiero. Based on the book of the same name.

* The Godfather Part I and II (1972 and 1974)

You all know these two movies. Francis Ford Coppola's account of immigration, and the American dream. Stars Pacino, De Niro, John Cazale, Marlon Brando, James Caan, and a plethora of other acting greats.

* Bus 174 (2002)

Brazilian documentary about the hostage situation on Bus 174. The movie touches on many issues that plague Brazilian society including poverty and corruption. 

* Serpico (1973)

Film that follows Al Pacino as Frank Serpico

* Dog Day Afternoon (1975)

Dio Mio! This italo-americano has a hard on for Al Pacino! You're not wrong but this film is awesome. Based on the real life hostage situation and robbery of a New York City bank. John Cazale (from the Godfather I and II) costars as Pacino's partner in crime.

* Clockers (1995)

Based off of the book of the same name. Spike Lee directed. Worth a watch but nothing special. Wee Bey is in the movie though for what it's worth.

* Infernal Affairs (2002) and The Departed (2006)

Infernal Affairs is the Hong Kong movie that inspired The Departed. Both are really good films with excellent casts.

* Once Upon a Time in America (1984)

Sergio Leone (The Man with No Name Trilogy) account of the forgotten Jewish-American gangsters. Stars Robert De Niro and James Woods. ***WARNING!!!*** The original theatrical version was cut down significantly by the movie studios so you need to watch the longer versions. Trust me on this one folks.

* Juice (1992)

Stars the phenomenal Tupac Shakur. Follows the destruction of a group of friends from Harlem

* Above the Rim (1994)

A young and promising basketball player struggles living with his single mother. Watch as he is influenced by a pair of brothers (Leon Robinson

* Menace II Society (1993)

Gritty portrayal of life in South LA. Follows a recent high school graduation as he robs and hustles with his loose-cannon best friend. Movie goes hand in hand with the next selection.

* Boyz n the Hood (1991)

The movie that started the ""gangster/hood films"" that were a big part of the 90s and the burgeoning West Coast G-Funk gangsta rap scene. Stars Ice Cube and Cuba Gooding Jr. as friends who grow up in South LA's poverty stricken neighborhoods. John Singleton directed.

* Friday (1995)

Hilarious day in the life in the ghetto of South LA. Stars Ice Cube as Craig and Chris Tucker in a memorable performance as stoner extraordinaire ""Smokey"" as they try to dodge gang members

**TV Shows**:

* Breaking Bad

No introduction needed here. Brian Cranston as a chemistry teacher who ""breaks bad"" and joins the burgeoning crystal meth trade after a recent cancer diagnosis. 

* Homicide: Life on the Street Seasons 1 and 2 (1993)

I only selected the first two seasons as they were the best (biased opinion

* The Corner (2000)

Wonderfully directed adaptation of David Simon and Ed Burns' book of a similar name. Many of the cast that are in ""The Wire"" appear in this show. 

* City of Men (Cidade dos Homens) (2002)

A spin off of the movie. Worth watching if you enjoyed City of God. Haven't gotten to far into the series.

* Oz (1997)

Follows the lives of the prisoners and staff at the fictional Oswald State Correctional Facility in New York. This show is very much like ""The Wire"" because of its social commentary. Also stars many actors from ""The Wire."" HBO's first 1 hour show. 

* Boardwalk Empire (2010)

Also stars many of the cast on ""The Wire, Italian, and Irish gangs portrayed the way they are. Show is nothing short of fantastic. Like other HBO shows, many actors from ""The Wire"" make an appearance. Notorious gangsters Bugsy Siegel, Lucky Luciano, Arnold Rothstein, Al Capone, and other bootleggers

As David Simon explains:



&gt; ""Season 3 reflects on the nature of reform and reformers, can mitigate against the forces currently arrayed against individuals.""



This theme is clearly stated from the beginning of season 3


Also, their optimism soon leaves them as dust envelopes the area and they see the physical consequences of the towers.  I was watching this episode with my father as I'm taking him through the seasons and this was clear to me then.  As Wikipedia explains:


&gt; ""This is symbolic of this season's theme of reform and its consequences that may not be immediately visible on the surface.  We've seen touches of this in season 2 with the announcement of the condominiums being built by the docks.


There are further examples shown in episode one, also in the opening.  


&gt; ""Don't matter how many times you get burnt


Although Bodie is clearly referring to Poot's repetitive behavior with women, he remarks to Massey, ""If you don't look at what you did before, you do the same shit all over.""  As Wikipedia states, McNulty could just as easily be talking about himself because he is showing signs of continuing the same kind of egotistical insubordination that he did in the first season.  I didn't really understand how this related to reform until I understood what entrenched behavior is, essentially meaning being stuck in one place where you feel safe, but are unable to move backwards or forwards without danger.  This definition helps explain how reform relates to Poot and McNulty's respective situations.


There are further examples in episode 10 entitled ""Reformation.""  The title clearly refers to the theme of season three as various characters are struggling to initiate reform on a personal and citywide level.  For instance


&gt; ""Reform Lamar


Wikipedia goes on to state that his remarks center on the empty political promises of reform in Baltimore


As stated previously, and this began back in season 2, we see Stringer Bell clearly trying to reform his organization, and the drug game as a whole.  ""You see people driving around in Toyota, Honda, territory don't mean shit.""  Not only that, he is trying to get into legitimate businesses.  Also, very blatantly trying to reform the war on drugs in his Hamsterdam experiment.  As a side note


Also, ""Fuck the politics for once.""


Finally, the way he handles the kids in Hamsterdam, the looks he gives Herc while Herc is being an idiot in front of Bunny, and the way he handles his lecture from Bunny at the end of the season, Carver shows great change.  Although we don't see the complete transformation of Carver until the first episode of season 4, the personal reforms he makes are clear.  Notice the very first line he says in season 4:


&gt; ""Where's the love Bodie?  Where's the mother fucking love?""


This line should be evidence enough that there was a massive change in Carver.  Not only that, it's clear that although he was already changing in the middle of season 3, Bunny's talk on what actual police work is truly hit home.


I know this isn't the tightest piece of writing and that some ideas are simply thrown out there


As a general conclusion, politicians, and police battle with personal and city-wide reform.

One could argue the entire show is about this, you have a cop, going after drug dealers, but using a druggie as her informant/contact. And she PAYS him for information to bust the dealers - thus allowing him to get high and perpetuate the problem that the law is originally designed to prevent. So the way Simon crafts it, in the larger view she's getting someone more addicted to drugs in order to enforce a law that is ostensibly supposed to help prevent drug addiction from becoming a problem. And this is just a highly inefficient waste of resources.

And this is illustrated even moreso when Bubbles calls Kima when he's trying to get clean. But she's been injured trying to catch the dealers. Here is a drug addict who DIRECTLY needs help but the institution is too busy basically playing a game to give a shit.

Even without everything else the show gets into, but if the goal is helping people, criminalization is such a roundabout way of achieving that. 

NOTE: Rereading this makes it seem like Kima is bad in some way for doing what she's doing, or if what they're doing is actually helping or making the problem worse. Not a knock on their profession, more an issue with the approach taken to the problem.",,False,self,t5_2reco,,http://www.reddit.com/r/TheWire/comments/1ate15/kima_bubbles_and_the_war_on_drugs/

To start things off

He also shows intelligence in two of the co-op meetings.  The first being when some free real estate opens up and Marlo tries to get Slim to step up, this time after Hungry Man's demise, we see Marlo trying to offer the space to Slim (""how bout you Tall Man?""), once again Slim declines (""I'm not cut out to be no CEO"").

Perhaps another piece of evidence occurs in season 5 when Omar comes after Slim to extract information due to Butchie's death.  After essentially being pistol whipped Slim uses logic and tells Omar to look at it from Joe's point of view

Finally, he takes out the Cheese (""That was for Joe.)""  As David Simon said, ""It was a betrayal too far and Slim had some feeling for one of his old bosses.""  And obviously everyone knows you can see him in the montage with Fat Face Rick talking to Vondas in the season 5 montage, assuming the throne at pretty much the best possible time.

Some other small things that I think should be mentioned but aren't as big as the others include the fact that Avon and Prop Joe seem to have a hell of a lot of confidence in him (""I'm leaving Cheese in charge to watch over things... you watch over Cheese""), the fact that he had Marlo in his sights at the end of season 3 and could have executed had McNulty and son not kicked the door in, maybe you can even include the fact that he still mentors Bodie and Poot despite them not being in the same crew anymore.

Typically, I noticed more subtleties that made me appreciate what Simon was doing. If you can put aside the absurdity of a police faking the existence of a serial killer, journalists and street dealers). The four systems have more in common than they'd ever care to admit

**“You believe everything you read?”**

This scene happens in the beginning of season 5. Dozerman and McNulty are on the roof and he's asking him if what he read in field reports is true. Did he really bang two hookers on the job? McNulty's response is an extreme example of foreshadowing about the lies the newspaper reporters will tell.

**“Sometimes I wonder what it would be like to work at a real fucking newspaper.”**

Uttered outside at a smoke break. The cops have the same sentiment, and wonder what their jobs would be like if things were different, if only things could change.

**Doing more with less**

Both the police department and the newspaper are facing severe budget cuts. For the newspaper, broken down cars, etc. Higher-ups on both sides urge their subordinates to learn to live with slashed budgets. Obviously the budget issues hit the mayor's office too, as they have to make tough decisions in where to direct the little funds they have to work with.

**One thieving politician trumps 22 dead bodies**

Both Carcetti and members of the police department (Daniels) are disgusted by the way the state's office is using resources to go after Clay Davis while 22 murders from the vacant row houses remain unsolved

**Made up quotes vs. made up killer**

Bunk has a line that goes “the bigger the lie, this is the theme of season 5 in a microcosm. Lies reflecting lies. The lies of Scott Templeton reflect the lies of McNulty. In the beginning, when Scott makes up quotes and sources for his stories and when McNulty starts to fabricate murders. Both lies just continue to escalate as the season goes on. On the newspaper side, it's Gus who suspects Scott is lying and on the police side, Bunk knows McNulty is lying, but both are essentially powerless to stop it.

**“Marlo doesn't get to win

I can't remember who says this (McNulty?), reprising the idea that some police have about how important it is to *win* when attacking these criminals, at all costs (see the next entry):

**“There are no rules. Fuckin game's rigged.”**

McNulty says this several times throughout the series, talking to the killer) in order to further his career, the same way it gives Jimmy the room to fabricate the serial killer to get funding and man-hours. It's also true the deeper you go into the police department when you consider the way the PD cooks the book/jukes the stats to make it seem like crime is going down, as well as all the bullshit journalist peddle to win Pulitzers. Lester has a quote later on about acting “without regard to the regular rules” when trying to rationalize their actions, which I loved.

**“It's Baltimore. No one lives forever.”**

Carcetti quote. Pretty self explanatory. Applies to the streets, politicians and journalists.

**""Dead where it doesn't count""** 

This is the part where Alma's story about the dead drug dealers gets chopped down to a few paragraphs, just a couple more dead black folks in the streets.

**Kicking the cop cars**

There are parallel scenes between season 4 and 5 – one where Bodie is tired of the bullshit after Lil Kev gets got, and he kicks the shit out of it until he hurts his foot. Same thing. Parallel frustrations within each system.

**Daniels/Gus handing out assignments at parallel staff meetings**

Pretty self explanatory. Gus and Daniels are each shown with their crews around them

**“You start to tell the story

I think this goes for all sides of the game. Jimmy, Carcetti in the mayor's office realizing he's essentially powerless to fix any of the city's problems, each of the major players in the drug game who fall victim to the system. McNulty is cut off by Beadie walking away, out of his life in a really emotional scene.

**The Diner**

There are lots of scenes in seasons 3-5 involving the same diner

**“Fuck

This one's subtle. So subtle that I didn't notice it til my third time around. This is some guy (his name isn't even important, and he's so disgusted and frustrated with the monotony that he's swearing the same way Jimmy and Bunk were during that infamous re-canvassing scene.

**The file in the drawer**

Another subtle but important parallel. Gus brings in an investigator to go through Scott's stories, Burrell has the file on Daniels that details the FBI's investigation for his embezzlement crimes. Both files could destroy the careers of the people involved. But neither Burrell nor Gus can really make the play, for fear of getting dirty in exposing the person they've come to rival, mostly because of local politics. Scott is the chosen one, favored by the higher-ups, same as Daniels.",,self,,

1356382780.0,15e235,Season 5 notes on the serial killer,bjarso,57,6,31,"I've been thinking about this for a while

I think that the serial killer in Season 5 is a direct reference to the DC sniper case from 2002. 

Reasons:

1. The case was incredibly over-hyped; with 13 total shootings in an area that has a total population of nearly 6 million people-- you had about a 100x higher chance of being struck by lightning in your lifetime (1/10, &amp; MD; gas stations started erecting tarps to ""shield"" people; and it made the cover of magazines across the country. Meanwhile, there were Baltimore gangs that killed more people in a weekend.

2. There was a leak in the police department that told the media about a tarot card that asked the police department to ""call me God""-- despite the card explicitly asking for it not to be released to the media. There were also a series of phone calls made to the police by Malvo &amp; Muhammed (which supposedly provided the lead that led to their arrest) as well as cryptic, etc. that were never explained to the public-- not even at trial. Also, no recording of this phone call was ever presented at trial.


3. The description of the suspect(s) went from a white male with military experience/training driving a white van (for weeks) to 2 black males (with zero weapons training) driving a blue caprice in a time span of hours. There is still no clear motive behind the murder spree except ""terrorism"" and the argument that Muhammed was prepping to kill his Ex-wife in a way that would make it look random (this was not allowed in trial, since they couldn't provide evidence of purchase. Given the difficulty of some of the shots (100 yards, one bullet), many wondered how Muhammed became a keen shot, to which police argued that he self taught how to snipe at firing ranges (specifically Bull's Eye gun range). This begs the question how did he get into the firing range without gun registration. By far the most damning evidence was their psuedo-confessions.

4. The case became a huge political touchstone, giving big PR to some DAs. Montgomery County police chief Charles Moose, who headed the investigation, would later write a book about the series as well as consult for a movie. The department, which wanted to keep certain details secret, fired him for doing so. 


Anyone else seeing the parallels? I wonder how much more there is to the case-- and how much Simon was privy to due to his time at The Sun. This also all occurred between 2002 and 2006-- right when Simon &amp; Burns would have been planning season 5. Any thoughts?

EDIT: I also want to make on more point. Plot lines in The wire are consistently historically accurate, Donnie Andrew's life as the real Omar, Bubbles based on Ed Burn's snitch by the same name, the elimination of the docks and their unions; it seams out of place that the 5th season would suspend his loyalty to authenticity

&gt; **Vinson**: Prison and graveyards are full of boys who wore the crown.

&gt; **Marlo**: Point is they wore it. It's my turn to wear it now. 

It's debatable whether Stringer wanted to wear the crown. Stringer knew there were ""games beyond 'the game'""

But what about Prop Joe?

I felt like Prop Joe was motivated by money alone which is why he brings the idea of a co-op to Stringer: increase profits and reduce cost (stop beefs and feuds which led to bodies and made business more costly). I can't think of any specific moments where Prop Joe comes off as power hungry.

I didn't think much about it until the same thing happens with Daniels and McNulty when they put Avon in cuffs. This time, and Jimmy follows him outside.

Poot knows he doesn't need to kill Wallace, maybe Bodie kills Wallace regardless, but maybe Poot convinces him otherwise. Either way, Poot has a choice. The same is true with Mcnulty. Mcnulty *knows* that he should put Stringer in cuffs, he *knows* that he has a chance to put him away, or at least make an attempt, but he puts those thoughts behind him and follows Daniels outside.

Hey.

Just got through watching all 5 seasons for the first time.

Gotta tell you

I had this idea of re-watching some good scenes on youtube after I finished watching an episode. Now

People labeling the videos really do put major spoilers in the title. You won't keep yourself from glancing at the related videos

I spoiled quite some great scenes for myself and just wanted to warn you from making the same mistake. Just find the scene in the episode you just watched

Just putting it out there because I haven't seen a post about this.

ok. so. I enjoy Portlandia. I think it's funny. The current season (three) of the show has a sketch called ""Spoiler Alert"" where the two main characters and two others go back and forth generally giving away key details of many popular television shows and movies. They covered Lost, etc. and overall, it's funny to watch. While watching this, I say out loud to my wife, ""They better not ruin The Wire for me"". Just as those prophetic words came out of my mouth, Fred Armisan says with his wide eyes,  [""Omar....he gets killed by a little kid?!""](/spoiler) .......................my jaw dropped.

At that moment I was about five episodes from said event. It's all I could think about and it pretty much ruined the moment. When the event happened

* In S5

* A friend of mine says that in S1 you can see Michael's mother walking around the low rises with a baby (presumably

* You can actually see even midway through S1 that Burrell has something over Daniels though ii isn't really acknowledged or talked about til much later. That one might be obvious to some people but i only just noticed it. 

* Jay Landsman was an actual person in the BPD and he even audiotioned for the role as himself. Apparently he wasn't a good enough version of himself and was instead cast as [Dennis Mello](http://seriesaddict.fr/images/galerie/The-Wire/promo3x04/Dennis%20Mello%20-1.jpg)

* Cheese is Randy's father (thanks to u/touchmyleftone)

On the most basic level possible, and never tells Marlo what he ""ought"" to do; he immediately levels with him, telling Marlo that he's working a shitty job to support his family.  The ""one way"" is simply what the guard wants; his self-interest, his autonomy, his expression of free will.

Marlo rejects the guard's effort to impose his will on him, and the penalty for doing so is death.

Results from the Final Four:

* (1) Bodie defeats (2) McNulty 87-82
* (1) Omar defeats (1) Stringer 120-45

Whew. Nearly a month later and here we are - down to just two. Omar and Bodie have come a long way in this tournament. As predicted, Poot, Prez, Cutty and most recently, Stringer Bell. Meanwhile, Bodie knocked off Johnny Weeks, Butchie, Bunk and McNulty on his way to the finals. Now the two go head-to-head in the Not-David-Simon-Approved Finals. Will Omar triumph as he has in just about every Wire-related ""Best Character"" discussion? Or is a Bodie a smart-ass pawn that's about to come at the king (and hopefully not miss)?

Here are a few character parallels I noticed

&gt; Duquan -&gt; Bubbles

At the end we see him shooting up with his new employer

&gt; Michael -&gt; Omar

Perhaps the most obvious one. The shotgun was a little over the top.

&gt; Sydnor -&gt; McNulty

Inspired by the work of Freamon and McNulty

&gt; Marlo -&gt; Avon

Avon and Marlo are similar in their complete disinterest in honest business or politics. They are both soldiers for life and Marlo realizes this as he scares off the two corner boys in the last episode. From season 3 onward we see Marlo rise to power in the same way Avon likely did: leaving a trail of blood and not looking back.

&gt; Wee Bey and/or Chris -&gt; Dennis Wise (aka Cutty)

We see Dennis redeem himself by giving back to the community after a life of crime. Wee Bey was having similar revelations about his life when he spoke with Bunny and his wife. At the end we see Chris approach Wee Bey and they begin talking. This relationship could lead to a similar change of heart in Chris. We know he isn't completely cold hearted by his sympathy for Michael.

If anyone has listened to Dan Carlin’s Hardcore History podcasts, at least in America, but it is one of the purest forms of contemporary tragic theater. However, a foundation for this argument must exist. In this case Aristotle’s Poetics will be used as the support beam for the ideal form of tragedy.

Aristotle’s definition of tragedy states that it “is an imitation, complete, and ample action, by means of language rendered pleasant at different places in the constituent parts by each of the aids used to make language more delightful, in which imitation there is also effected through pity and fear its catharsis of these and similar emotions.”

This is pretty straightforward, if one were to exclude the last part where he emphasizes pity, fear and the catharsis of similar emotions.

Catharsis, as after an overwhelming experience, that restores or refreshes the spirit.”

Despite the ambiguity of this definition, according to Merriam-Webster, “experienced or realized through imaginative or sympathetic participation in the experience of another”. Catharsis and vicarious both mean the same thing in that the audience member will feel the same emotion and almost live the same experience as the character that the actor is playing. Both words mean more than the standard audiovisual participation by the viewer, but an almost involuntary exercise in empathy that seems to be out of the audience member’s control. 

Aristotle then puts down a much more concrete list of what defines tragedy

•	Plot (*mythos*)

•	Character (*ethos*)

•	Thought or Theme (*dianoia*)

•	Language or Diction (*lexis*)

•	Music (*melos*)

•	Spectacle (*opsis*)

Finally

*peripeteia* – A reversal of fortunes.

*hamartia* – “Tragic flaw” or the logical set of events that led to a character

*anagnorisis* – When the character(s) realize their error or their own tragedies.
	
Starting the comparison with the easiest, this being the list set out by Aristotle; The Wire’s plot is not only complex, but far reaching and interconnected. This is to say that, in terms of the socioeconomic ladder of today, the actions of the poorest heroin addict that wanders the streets can have a humongous effect that can affect the political titans of Baltimore. This is reminiscent to the Butterfly Effect seen in chaos theory where the smallest change in one area can lead to enormous shifts on the other end. What makes the plot of this show truly astounding is the entirely logical chain of events that displays this effect and how, when looking at each step from beginning to end, there is not a single point in it that leaves one questioning the causality of any action.

While doing this, as only one example, of The Wire exemplifies all of the above. While it is hard to show the logical steps involved in reaching the conclusion without having watched both the first season and this one, the below Youtube videos, and commentary for clarification, show glimpses of the series while displaying the three attributes Aristotle listed.

*Frank Sobotka (the balding gentleman with the ‘blue steel’) is clearly in firm control and with a definite plan in which to get the canals dredged. Note that the method in which Frank gets the money to lobby the Baltimore politicians are not only illegal

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ISyyX1TpQCk

*A quick rundown of the history of the IBS union by a proud Frank.*

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-j5XWo1fPI

*Frank’s disgust at the current state of affairs and what he has to do to try and change them.*

These three scenes precisely show the inherent ‘tragic flaw’ in Frank and his initially hopeful state of affairs. He is always looking into the glory of the past with a sense of pride, leads him to try and figuratively reverse time; directly leading to his own personal tragedy.

Throughout the whole season

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkxYIHsmUQo

*Frank is talking to his son Ziggy in jail after Ziggy went through his own anagnorisis.*

This scene is touching not only because it shows the ultimate reversal of fortunes for Ziggy

The above scenes hit all three of the major points that Aristotle considered as the most important part of a tragedy

While there is no single scene that can do justice to the dialogue of this show

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYgKmOJT_gM

*This is the very first scene of the entire show and displays the disparity in language between what is encountered everyday in a normal college campus and that of the urban environment in Baltimore.*

The scene is able to perfectly portray this dichotomy in language with the detective speaking in a dialect that is much more readily understood by the average viewer while the person he is talking to speaks not just with different terms

There are not many times in the show where music is played over the scene without that music being a part of the scene itself. However

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SO40ansNU8

*In the ending of that season

Regarding the least important of Aristotle’s list

http://www.reddit.com/r/TheWire/comments/1au9pz/shots_like_these_make_me_love_the_wire/

Yet, fine minutiae, themes and allegories that no single paper can ever give this show the value it deserves.

Having said that, made up of the people that inhabit it, is more than just the physical location of the show, but symbolic of the life of everyone watching the show. Each character in the show throws a light onto a different facet of Baltimore, with every tragedy coloring that light through the rise and fall of fortunes for that character. This ever changing spectrum of light is the way the world and life is. While every single person has their own tragedies with their own changing viewpoints corresponding to those tragedies, it is hard to visualize other people’s viewpoints and the way they those changes can directly affect other people.

What this show does is not only bring these tragedies of other people to surface, it cannot but bring about the rise or fall of another fortune. Perhaps the tragedy of The Wire is not the tragedy of the characters in the show, but the tragedy of the audience through the show’s acuity in such a painfully accurate portrayal of the zero-sum game of life.

So it's pretty clear that by the end of the series Michael has ""inherited"" Omar's role while Dukie ends up becoming the new Bubbles.  This got me thinking that Namond and Randy also have to take up the mantle of certain characters.  The way I see it

Namond is frequently described as being ""all talk"", is ""all talk"" in that he rarely follows through on promises to the various people from whom he basically steals money.  He is also pretty damn lucky, being a rich politician who fucks everyone over and ultimately gets no comeuppance.  He even mentions escaping the streets in his youth, much like Namond.  In one episode they are directly compared.  Namond tosses the flyers Randy was supposed to hand out, saying it was the flyer guy's fault for paying them in advance.  The same is later said about someone who paid Davis money in advance.  In his final appearance Namond is developing his public speaking skills, which is a huge part of Clay's success.  This leads me to wonder whether it was ultimately beneficial to get Namond off the street.  Had he stayed, he would certainly end up like D'Angelo, he's being groomed into the successor to one of the most negative forces on the show.

Randy, while he was shown to have a great  respect towards Carver.  We last see him growing into a violent bully in the group home, which could imply that he would become a gang enforcer, but it's unlikely he can get enough respect for that after snitching.  Ultimately he's a great candidate to put on a badge and use that as an excuse to brutalize the kind of kids who put his foster mother in the hospital.  Also, while Randy is one of the most likable and tragic characters on the show, Walker is one of the most hateful and unsympathetic ones.  Merging these two characters would be a great way of emphasizing the Wire's gray morality.",,self,,

The series follows the MO of David Simon

The result is a monstrosity. There is no way to distance yourself from it through stories of heroes and bad people, sometimes funny, sometimes relatable, but mainly just people performing a work which happens to be mass killing.

That's the problem though, which seems like the only way available to us to deal with the reality we face](/spoiler).

Generally, up until this point, The Wire has been laying down the groundwork to show us why a scenario such as 'McNulty's Serial Killer' is entirely plausible. The key missing ingredient in Baltimore that makes the story plausible is a fact check. All of the stakeholders involved with McNulty's Serial Killer are looking to make capital ahead of anything else. In the case of McNulty and Freamon, they're using the homeless to make policing capital by catching Marlo Stanfield, Templeton is using the homeless to make journalistic capital by writing a Pulitzer-winning article, Carcetti is using the homeless to make political capital and heighten his public image, all the while failing to address the issues that brought about homelessness in the first place. Fact checking McNulty's creation would do nothing but reduce the likelihood of exploiting capital from the situation

It is this 'perfect storm' of interests that makes the Serial Killer Story last until it dies (not with a fact check, when I considered all the characters’ motivations Season 5 seemed just as real as, and a natural extension of, what came before it. Believing that Freamon would team up with McNulty in an instant was perhaps the only leap of faith for me.

Season 3’s Hamsterdam plot on the other hand continually goes unnoticed for a long period of time. In terms of realism

McNulty chiding his partner Bunk for answering the phone and catching a case unlikely to go black

I never thought about how much actually goes on in an episode of The Wire. It is pretty complex

I have to admit to being confused with some of the names the first time around, but all the same,I can think of worse things than being stuck with a DVD of The Wire for entertainment.

So much stuff going on. I thought a summary of the main points would encourage some debate...

---
- Snot Boogie is shot and McNulty gets a witness to open up

        McNulty:-
        If Snot Boogie always stole the money
        Witness:-
        Got to... this America man.

---
- Stringer Bell and associates successfully intimidate state's witness, where they also pay off another witness to muddy the waters by recanting her original recollection of the murder, while McNulty looks on as an interested spectator.

---
- McNulty stirs up his first hornet's nest, and what's going on in his own courtroom under his nose.

---
- We see our first street rip, as Kima shows up her two colleagues even though she is the junior detective.

---
- It's the new millennium and we are given a glimpse of the ""high-tech"" equipment they have available to write up the street rip.


---
- Carver makes a succinct observation regarding the ""war"" on drugs.

        Kima Greggs:-
        Fighting the war on drugs... one brutality case at a time.
        Carver:-
        Girl
        Herc:-
        Why not?
        Carver:-
        Wars end...

---
- Bunk gives a fuck

---
- Major Rawls introduces McNulty to his two middle fingers for the first time and afterwards is given a piece of prophetic advice by his sergeant

---
- D'Angelo gets busted down to the low-rises as punishment for getting himself charged with murder.

---
- Bubbles pulls his money scam.

        D'Angelo:-
        This look like money
        That shit look green to you?

---
- Bubbles gives some sage advice to his partner in crime

        Bubbles:-
        I'm tryin' give you a little game
        Johnny:-
        Yo
        Bubbles:-
        Naah... naah... you green... I'm tryin to get you brown man... but you still green.

---
- The ball is set rolling on Daniels' detail and the Deputy Ops makes it clear to him what he expects of him and the detail.

---
- McNulty visits his FBI buddy, while the FBI are capable of obtaining and remotely monitoring a live video feed of a package being vialed up in a house in Pimlico.

---
- Fitzhugh also mentions the FBI getting out of drugs and concentrating on terrorism. Despite the fact that the episode was filmed only a couple of weeks after 9/11

---
- Johnny shows that he is still green, resulting him being beaten to within an inch of his life and needing a colostomy bag when he recovers and Bubbles seeking out Kima, in an attempt to see Johnny's attackers get what they deserve.

---
- The first few recruits to the Avon Barksdale detail are brought together for the first time and McNulty is put in his place by Daniels after protesting the way in which the investigation will be carried out.

---
- McNulty exhibits some remorse for back-dooring the department

        McNulty:-
        I feel like that motherfucker at the end of The Bridge On The River Kwai

I find that notion a little curious and confusing. (This is kind of me thinking out loud

Just to get this out of the way: The main antagonists/players in the series are Avon, they had Sobotka. I wouldn't say Sobotka was a throw-away character just there to serve the story, especially if this is the most important scene of the series. Also, aside from D'angelo, his mother and Avon, there weren't too many families represented on the other side of the law. (Michael has his brother, Cheese is Prop Joe's nephew, Nick and Ziggy maintained more of that familial vibe/bond. This is probably a direct parallel to how Frank is the pater familias to the dock's longshoremen population ([took that directly from Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Sobotka).)

Here's where discussion gets a little tricky: Avon, Stringer and Marlo had street smarts and knew the game, they had more of a defensive ""don't get caught"" mentality. Their intelligence was based on how to stay out of jail and get more money. Sobotka started out as an honest worker. Along the way he started allowing things to happen at the docks (based on lack of work for his crew, he needed to provide for his guys) but I believe he felt he was doing the right thing, or at least doing the wrong thing for the right reasons. I don't think he ever considered himself a villain. (That may be why this is the most important scene, because all of us are capable of making the wrong choice, even if we tell ourselves it's for the right reasons, which may spark some heated debate. While Avon, which he takes pride in. He happens to be white. (The racial implication of a white man working an ""honest"" job and the black members of society running drugs...this is where the debate comes in

It's probably because of his quiet, and reveal what I think is his driving motive: respect. 

While String might be in it for the money and legitimacy, Marlo's number 1 motive, IMO, is personal respect. Of all of The Wire's main characters, Marlo takes the biggest slight to insults on his personal image, his name. Maybe it's really a sign of deep insecurity, but Marlo's main goal doesn't seem to be money or even power but for an unfaltering awe of his persona.
