I consider our discussion on what our new community guidelines should be a rousing success! [Here is the link to that thread for those interested.](http://www.reddit.com/r/goldredditsays/comments/ur2nu/i_want_you_to_join_the_discussion_on_what_grs/)

[For fun

Rule I: Posts that are bigoted, transphobic, unsettling, racist, homophobic, or just reeking of unexamined, toxic privilege will probably result in a ban.

* Notes: This is standard across all Fempire subreddits and will remain as a rule of prime importance here. We want GRS to be free from the usual bad stuff that's standard on the rest of Reddit. Only golden comments should be found on GoldRedditSays!

Rule II: Please include the post count in brackets along with a quote as the title of the gold you are submitting. A brief summary for context or for complex posts is also acceptable.

* Notes: This rule is so we can easily see the gold that a miner has found and allows for some flexibility if it's needed.

Rule III: Please link to an individual post and refrain from liking to an entire submission. Please do not say ""this whole thread

* Notes: Reddit can be very variable and there's no guarantee that a thread filled with gold today will still see that gold at the top tomorrow. By picking out your favourite nugget of gold it adds a little more permanence.

Rule IV: Please link only to upvoted posts. We want to see people agreeing with gold

* Notes: This one is a bit controversial, maybe we need a vote on this one? [EDIT: A poll has been added here, upvote your desired choice, feel free to debate the pros and cons as well.](http://www.reddit.com/r/goldredditsays/comments/uvklw/goldredditsays_new_community_guidelines_are_here/c4yxqua) This rule has been altered to disallow downvoted posts.

Rule V: Feel free to upvote the gold!

* Notes: This isn't SRS

Rule VI: Please do not link to a comment by an SRSer

* Notes: SRSers post gold all the time, which is to chronicle gold posted by Redditors in the wild.

Rule VII: Please do not link to threads you have some involvement in.

* Notes: This is in the interests of fairness and neutrality

I think this is everything, so any feedback or suggestions are totally welcome.

Thanks for all the input and happy mining!

&gt;We don't know about the girl in the OP. She may very well be popular or for some other reason have been awarded this.
We can't assume it was given to her for being disabled.
And people with cerebral palsy aren't mentally deficient. In fact, is the CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER of a multi million dollar company. He's also married and has kids. He could have been prom king on his own merit. When people like you talk about him being a retard, I question your intelligence.
I teach disabled young adults and there is one very low IQ young woman who is the most disciplined, by the way), but with her neurotypical peers.
I think making the assumption that she couldn't be popular and worthy of prom queen just because she's disabled is as bad as giving her a title because she's disabled.
