I sometimes see posts asking about where to watch Arsenal games in my city or it's my first time going to the Emirates which pub should i go too.
 
so I started this [Google Map](https://maps.google.com/maps/ms?msid=218285163123318628581.0004d9ebe6f453b6f724e&amp;msa=0) of bar's/pubs/boozers to watch Arsenal Matches or are just Arsenal Friendly in general. 

I got a lot of these places from [Arsenal.com](http://www.arsenal.com/usa/news/features/arsenal-bars)

I'd love to get people from all over the world to add to this list and so it help other Gooners who are either on business trips

if you could also just give me some general feedback on improvements or just let me know that ""Somebody did this already dipshit! here's a link to it""

This is just in it's infancy so there hasn't been much work gone into this yet. if it's successful enough feedback wise i'm happy add/remove places. it might be a handy link for people to have.

OUT
Park-Chu Young to Celta Vigo for around 4 million.  Bendtner to Juventus.  Chamakh and Miquel to Malaga.

IN
Loic Remy (50/50) for about 10-15 million.  Cheik Tiote in.  Michael Essien in on season long loan with option to buy.  Dzeko's name thrown around but I doubt we buy him.  Apparently we've made an Enquiry about Sturridge (Doubt we can get him).  Possibly Yohan Cabaye

If something is confirmed

**CONFIRMED** Daniel Boateng loaned out to Oxford United until January.  [Source](http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/19404482)

EDIT:  We may make a bid for Sturridge

EDIT:  10-15 million for Remy (MAYBE)

EDIT:  Now possibly less likely that we get Essien on loan.  Chelsea turned down a loan bid from Everton for him

EDIT:  Squillaci's contract may be bought out.

EDIT:  Ignasi Miquel could go to Malaga on LOAN

EDIT:  Clint Dempsey situation being monitored by Arsenal

EDIT:  Fernando Llorente could be a possible target.  It would cost anywhere from 20-25 million to get him.  Odds on him joining Arsenal went from 7/1 to 7/2 yesterday.

EDIT:  Arsenal could make a bid for Yanga-Mbiwa which would be from around 6-10 million.  Doesn't seem likely after the champions league draw.

EDIT:  Gregory Van Der Wiel could be signed tomorrow.  Plenty of rumors linking him to us

EDIT:  This sucks.  Please sign someone.

If Liverpool do sell Suarez to you, only registered charities.** It could be a charity that works with the club, or a charity that you have a personal connection to. Whatever you favour most, I'll donate £25 to if the transfer goes through.

I know £25 isn't a large amount of money

This is not an attack against dissenters

So what are your thoughts? your issues? your compliments?

Also keep it as civil as possible even if you disagree.

**Points raised so far:**

Issues:

* Memes

* Layout of the subreddit

* Your new kit isn't post material. Seriously

* Proper sources for transfer rumours. There will be some issue here as crap sources sometimes do have quality. See Gary Neville writing for the Daily Mail as an example.

The good:

* Pre-match analysis like the one trending right now

* Good videos that have not been posted a billion times/ havent been posted in a while

* Biased Match Threads

* Tottenham bashing in moderation

* Great articles.  see u/charzan usually good stuff

* Tactics


Also upvote for visibility


Edit: This has been up long enough for me to gather that we are very different and I see why implementing anything here is a bit of an issue. That being said there seems to be a couple of issues that we

* Fifa 13 posts are not relevant. This goes without saying

* Pictures of your kids and pets. Adorable but outside of going ""aaw"" there is nothing more to say and this stuff belongs with your friends and family. 

* Your new kit. This is my big one. Really

I can't for the life of me understand why the club is pushing so hard for Suarez and dismissing Higuain. It seems unlikely that Liverpool would sell Suarez to us for less than 50-55m.  Liverpool does not want to sell him to another PL club and especially one above them in the table if they have Champions League aspirations. It seems the only way it could be made to work is if Suarez makes a mess of it and asks for a transfer. He seems reluctant to do so. I understand that he is absolutely a top class goal scorer, and a biter.
On the other hand, and cheaper. I understand that he is not the goal scorer that Suarez is, but make no mistake, he is a top class finisher. Last season, we had a very balanced scoring squad. Our striker doesn't need to carry the load, so to speak. We need a striker that can show that he can regularly bury the ball in front of the net. I like Giroud, but how many times did he miss horribly from in front of the net? If we spend the whole summer chasing a ghost and let our second and third options sign away to other clubs
I would rather we slightly overpay for Higuain (32m) than drastically overpay Suarez (55m). If we sign Higuain now, Bernard, Williams, and Cesar.

edit: I had originally put Higuain's cost at 37m. That reported number was in euros. I changed it to the GBP price for accuracy. My apologies.",self,t5_2qhqt,1374612572.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/Gunners/comments/1iwgr6/anyone_else_want_higuain_over_suarez/

I wasn't really a fan of the design in /r/GunnersTest alhough it did have some elements that I liked. But it was missing the gooner alien

I hope you like the changes I've made here. I'm not really a designer so this does not come naturally to me. I am open to suggestions on ways to improve the design as I still consider that there is too much blue left over from the default style.

Some of the graphics could do with improving. The banner background at the top is not great but I did my best and the red Gunners logo in the top right is still a bit weak.

If you want to help improve the design then by all means improve the banner background and other graphics here. If you don't like the design at all then don't be afraid to say so. I will happily revert it or use the design from /r/GunnersTest instead.

**Feedback is very welcome so speak your mind.**

&gt; Morning all. As many of you will be aware
&gt; 
&gt; I'm privileged to bring you live coverage of that meeting: the conversation
&gt; 
&gt; Ivan is already here
&gt; 
&gt; Arsene arrives; apologises for being late. Apparently he was driving with the handbreak on. #ArsenalLive
&gt; 
&gt; Ivan &amp; Arsene currently discussing which of Ivan's perplexing myriad of accents would be most suited to the meeting. #ArsenalLive
&gt; 
&gt; They've plumped for transatlantic drawl. He can always slip in to South African if things take a bad turn. #ArsenalLive
&gt; 
&gt; Arsene &amp; Ivan anxiously await RVP. AW idly fondles a pain aux raisin; Gazidis plays Angry Birds. The atmosphere is electric. #arsenallive
&gt; 
&gt; Annie Wenger brings in a jug of orange juice. Arsene tests it &amp; is furious when he discovers it has bits in. Robin hates bits. #ArsenalLive
&gt; 
&gt; Annie Wenger is crying next door. Ivan Gazidis is hurriedly trying to remove all the bits with a tea-strainer. #ArsenalLive
&gt; 
&gt; Ivan asks Arsene if he could briefly explain the offside rule before Robin arrives. Arsene says it is not a good time. #ArsenalLive
&gt; 
&gt; Robin is 5mins late. AW is grey with worry. His phone rings
&gt; 
&gt; Doorbell: Robin arrives. Darren Dein is with him. Ivan deploys South African mode. #ArsenalLive
&gt; 
&gt; Quartet make small-talk. Conversation turns to old friends: Thierry, Samir. A pattern emerges. AW gulps. #ArsenalLive
&gt; 
&gt; On Nasri
&gt; 
&gt; Arsene diligently pours himself a bowl of Bran Flakes - he is worried there will not be any significant movement this summer. #ArsenalLive
&gt; 
&gt; Robin takes a croissant. Arsene offers him red jam
&gt; 
&gt; Arsene is struggling to cut the fruit loaf. He mumbles something about his knife ""lacking a little bit sharpness."" #ArsenalLive
&gt; 
&gt; Talk turns to this season. AW congratulates RVP on his individual awards. Robin says he'd swap them all for a trophy. #ArsenalLive
&gt; 
&gt; Ivan reaches under the table &amp; produces a '3rd place' trophy. He made it at home
&gt; 
&gt; Robin takes it; hands it to DD
&gt; 
&gt; There is a lull in conversation. Ivan tries to lift spirits by pondering which way up the chocolate digestives should go. #ArsenalLive
&gt; 
&gt; IG:""You'd assume chocolate on top
&gt; 
&gt; Seeking to move things along
&gt; 
&gt; Arsene is on his second bowl of Bran Flakes. Vitamin B12: For mental strength. #ArsenalLive
&gt; 
&gt; RVP enquires about proposed M'Vila deal. AW explains it broke down over failure to acquire enough apostrophes for club shop. #ArsenalLive
&gt; 
&gt; RVP asks about new coaches. AW explains he's hired someone indelibly linked with the fabric of the club. An Arsenal legend... #ArsenalLive
&gt; 
&gt; ...He motions to the door. Kaba Diawara walks in. Robin tries to leave. #ArsenalLive
&gt; 
&gt; Robin calms down as AW explains that Diawara's role will not extend beyond Pat Rice's cone duties. #ArsenalLive
&gt; 
&gt; AW smiles knowingly. He thinks he has the clincher... #ArsenalLive
&gt; 
&gt; AW invites RVP to the patio, Szczesny, &amp; Ramsey perform an acappella version of East 17's 'Stay Now'. #ArsenalLive
&gt; 
&gt; On the line
&gt; 
&gt; RVP applauds politely; asks why Ramsey didn't know words. AW says he planned to use Diaby but he failed a late fitness test #ArsenalLive
&gt; 
&gt; They return to the house. Arsene suggests the quartet showed great mental strength to perform in the Hertfordshire chill. #Arsenallive
&gt; 
&gt; RVP says he needs time to think. He &amp; DD need to talk to a man about a dog. The dog is in Manchester
&gt; 
&gt; After a long silence, and leaves. Then remembers this is his house, and comes back. #ArsenalLive
&gt; 
&gt; Ivan departs. Meeting adjourned. TO BE CONTINUED. Thanks for following #arsenallive.

1330879768.0,qha4n,Perspective,mitters,147,17,58,"Food for thought.

Back in August Lee Dixon said we’d be lucky to make the top 8 with our current squad. 

Wenger has not just lost Cesc and Nasri

Liverpool have a net transfer spend of 38.6 mil in 2011/12 season
Chelsea have a net transfer spend of 62.7 mil in 2011/12 season
Arsenal have a net transfer profit 14.7 mil in 2011/12 season

Just over a year ago our biggest transfer “need” was to buy a goalkeeper. 

Many feared we might not even get past Udinese to make the group stage of the CL this year

The current season is far from over

We have money to spend (50mil in the bank) and  the board might finally be ready to spend money on players

RVP will likely stay as they’ll break the bank to keep him.

Wilshire will return.

The OX is improving and will play a much bigger role next season.

We’ve spent less than Chelsea &amp; Liverpool - who are both below us. 

We’ve lost key players - yet our league performance could easily see us improve on our final position last year.

This isn’t reactionary in light of a few good results

I’d rather be a Gooner than a Chelsea or Liverpool fan. 

The media keeps talking about Arsenal and it’s many problems

As Gooners we really can be optimistic about the future.

Yesterday I code [this quick web app](http://gunnerstv.herokuapp.com/) to let anyone check if the Gunners are playing today and if so on which UK or US Channels ( other countries are coming soon ) are broadcasting the game.

There's also a list of free live Streams to watch the Gunners. ( I get the data from atdhe.eu ) 

If they are not playing

It was a fun app to code and it took me ~10H.

So many people are being ridiculously negative on this subreddit.

We have a kick ass squad. Those saying we need to spend the money to replace RVP

Those saying Podolski doesn't make it at big clubs? Bayern Munich is one club. Different league, different team, different fans. He's also a different person now. More mature, probably knows what he wants from life. Even when he plays poorly he scores. He's versatile, he's a goal scorer, he's a winner. 

Giroud was top scorer in the french league for Montpellier. He pretty much won the league for them over PSG. The Man City of France. He has the belief to win against the odds. He has the ability to score goals

We've also bought Cazorla. The best midfielder in La Liga behind Xavi and Iniesta according to many footballers and bloggers and podcasters. He was Spanish player of the year in 2009. He's won all the major trophies one can win with Spain. He's a winner. I mean

We also have Wilshere coming back, Class Is Permanent.

So we're gonna get rid of Song? Who cares! If he wants to leave, and he possesses fantastic technique.

Wenger has been quoted as saying he is still looking in the market. He has 24million to burn. (on the Arsenal player)

We have the best Welsh player and captain.

We have the best Czech player and captain.

We have the best Russian player and captain.

We have one of

We have one of the most underrated spanish midfielders in the world. Someone who brings calm to a storm and has lego hair.

We have the fastest footballer in the world.

We have the most skilful african in the world.

We have a cuddly maverick.

We have one of the most cocky goalkeepers in the world.

We have a Centre back who told Barca to fuck off.

We have the Verminator.

Now grow some balls guys and trust in Arsenal!

* **Interest in him isn't anywhere near as high as he thought.** Only Juventus, which leaves him with Juventus or bust. Not the wealth of options he would have expected to have had after his last season.

* **He's not going to get a long-term contract.** No-one in their right mind is going to offer van Persie a long-term contract considering his age and injury record. Any club that does could be saddled with an old

* **He's a bit of a system babby.** He is an excellent technical player, very fast (look at his form for the Netherlands in recent years). 

* **He has lost the respect of the Arsenal fans.** By making a public statement deriding the club's direction, his presence at the club is now resented and he has been rightly stripped of the captaincy. 

* **Arsenal have called his bluff.** Arsenal with the signings of Podolski and Giroud had worked fast to replace van Persie - I think  we all knew that realistically you can't have a starting French, and if we can snap up one of those then we are going to be a much better team than we ever were with Robin van Persie in it.

1368129622.0,1e0svj,Insight into Kroenke's Sports Empire: Why you can't compare Apples and Arsenal,ReasonedAmerican,127,22,67,"A couple of weeks ago /u/phreaqo posted a nice little summary of [Arsenal’s Fianancial Situation and “Kroenke’s Mediocrity”](http://www.reddit.com/r/Gunners/comments/1d10om/arsenal_finances_in_layman_terms_kroenkes/). It was a good post

The point made that I had a problem with was this:

&gt;6) Finally, making it the perfect investment for a collector of sports teams with no ambition.

This paragraph does a disservice to Gooners who don’t know how American sports

It is important to point out at the beginning that Kroenke is no longer in direct control of this team. He was forced to give control to his son when he became sole owner of the St Louis Rams of the NFL in 2010.

Kroenke became the full-owner of the Nuggets in 2000.

in 1995 Kroenke bought a 40% stake in the Rams when they moved from Los Angeles to St. Louis. He then became full owner in 2010

**1) The Nuggets and Rams are a small-market teams, Liverpools, Madrids, Paris, etc of Europe) of the US.**

This is a major constraint in all sports in all countries. The best players want to play in the biggest cities where they can maximize their exposure and their own brand.

**2) The teams he had just bought were not anywhere near the quality of Arsenal**

In the 3 years prior to his taking over the Nuggets they finished in last place, having never even been to a NBA final (the NBA like all major American professional sports uses a playoff system to determine the champion).

The Rams had not made it to the NFL playoffs for 5 straight years prior to Kroenke buying in and their records during those years were; 5-11, 5-11, and 4-12. Now The Ram’s like the Nuggets didn’t have a great history of winning, though they had won 2 NFL championships those came in 1945 and 1951. The NFL has been dominated by a handful of teams in its history: the NY Giants, Dallas Cowboys, San Francisco 49ers, Pittsburg Steelers

**3) In the years since Kroenke took over the teams have seen “Golden Eras”**

The Nuggets have placed first or second in it’s division each year starting with 04/05. During this time the NBA title has been won by 6 teams: Los Angeles Lakers (5x), and one each for the Detroit Pistons, Boston Celtics, and Dallas Mavericks. The Lakers, Celtics, Heat, and Mavericks, were populated by players who will go down as some of the best to ever play the games. These are your Kobe Bryant’s, etc etc. These were and are the best of the best in the NBA a league in which having 1 or 2 true superstars can is everything. 

The Ram’s from 1995-2005 were consistently one of the best teams in the NFL. Their offense was so good it was nicknamed the “Greatest Show on Turf”. They reached the Super Bowl twice and won 1 (1998). The team saw a drastic dropoff in quality after these years as their star players aged/retired/left. This loss of talent coupled with the rise of 4 of the greatest QBs in NFL history created a climate in which it was difficult for the Rams to get back to their winning ways. Their prospects in the near future are good though. The team has a good young QB and has been making BIG moves (and yes I mean BIG) this offseason to surround with with the talent required to win. 

**4) The salary cap

The main thing that makes in impossible to compare how Kroenke runs his teams and what he can do with Arsenal is the salary cap.

Basically in the NBA and NFL there is a set limit a team came spend each year on its players. In the PL City’s wage bill was 202 million pounds

What these constraints on spending means is that a team cannot just come in and throw bags upon bags of money at players (like two teams I’m sure you can think of). Teams are required to build from within through the drafting of young players which puts more emphasis on scouting

Also


**5) Player contracts**

This goes along with the salary cap

**6) The Draft**

This comes in right behind the salary cap as reasons why you can’t compare Kroenke’s other teams with Arsenal. In American sports players are not brought up from young ages under youth contracts. Players play on college teams and after playing 1, or the full 4 years in college they enter the draft. Each team gets one pick per round ( you can trade picks for other picks or players) and the order each team picks is based on their record the previous year. Basically, the bad teams get to pick up the best players.  Also, you have to remember that for the most part the players picked in the first round are ready to be be starters or even superstars their first year. It’s not like they get drafter and won’t contribute for 4-5 years. Imagine instead of QPR getting relegated they stay in the premier league and get to pick the highest rated player in the world aged between 19-22.

**Conclusion**

The fact that the Nuggets have been able to build and sustain a winning team while having it’s best players leave in free agency or demand to be traded is a great testament to the organization. Looking forward the team has a good young core and if they can continue to make smart moves in free agency and the draft they will have a chance to win in the years ahead as the NBA’s new salary cap and taxing rules come into full force and prevent the large market teams form having 2

The Rams have peaked

End the end both teams are run well and can’t give us much of any insight into how Kroenke plans to run Arsenal in the future.

Any questions

1355338861.0,14qlm4,"Tired of the unjustified hate and blame towards individual players, especially Ramsey, Chamakh, and partly Arshavin. It is beginning to make me think this subreddit has forgotten how to analyze a player properly. Here is my Chamakh assessment.",rblakew21,32, but I am going to show you the post about Chamakh that has started this post from me:

""He isn't playing because he is damaged goods and we can't ship him out. He is pathetic in almost every department.
We have enough trouble on our plate

First I cannot begin to see why Chamakh hasn't been given a slight bit more chances. His stats for the season (not including preseason) are 4 appearances total, it wasn't his best outing we have ever experienced, but he worked hard and drew 3 fouls upfront, and even put a shot on frame on the only chance he saw lay for him properly, which is apparently hard for even our starters. the other two games were carling cup substitution, one at the 59th and the other at the 71st... in the Hour he played against Bradford he managed 3 shots 1 on target and drew one foul, even managing to not pick up a yellow or commit a foul himself. During the Bradford game he managed to hold up play and look for space

Here is his only game I can find recapped online from 2012/13 so far:

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGtTJnHhX8g

as you can see, occasionally he took the riskier pass, usually unsuccessful, but it kept their defense honest. He moved the ball and there is nothing that can be faulted during this game.

2011/12 Was a statistically awkward season for him in total he appears lackluster, only managing 1 goal and 1 assist, on separate occasions. But in reality he only started 7, never once consecutive despite performance, substituting on 12 times, of those substitutions he only made it on the field before the 75th minute 3 times (one being the 74th minute).  Both of his goal and assist were in vain as to they were the dismal 4-3 loss to Blackburn as a 75th minute sub scorer, and the dismal second loss to Olympiakos 3-1 in which he started and earned an assist.  During his 7 starts he managed 12 shots, but what offsets that is he has managed to draw 10 fouls during that

Here is a video of his 2011/2012 season a few shots from preseason goals in it I think... it shows the good and bad sides of him, he could have had a 10 goal season (and yes that is my OPINION I do UNDERSTAND the last statement is MY OPINION, thank you).

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i48TMcj00Aw

For his first season I'm going to be brief because it speaks for itself, but those don't speak numbers of his actual performance. Only 6 starts from the January 1st on, in which he only managed 1 goal and 2 assists. In the first 23 starts he managed 12 goals and 3 assists. He also drew in 52 fouls that season.

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wj9WDEvDkWQ

Throughout his career at arsenal you can see through video he has a good knack for one touch passing, he his constantly moving and looking to receive the ball, he has the will we constantly says our players lack, and this is by no means a support for Chamakh to be starting,I just wanted people to realize some of these palyers they want to hate aren't as bad as they seem in these posts I Keep reading. I only played the numbers game because there are so few video's of Chamakh out.

---

**Formations**

[Possible starting line-ups](http://imgur.com/kojRlhM)

NEWCASTLE: [Previous starting XI v QPR (A

Newcastle will be forced to play 3rd choice GK Steve Harper tomorrow, who has been filling in at LB for the past couple of games. Although Tiote was injured against QPR, he has been passed as fit to start tomorrow, so Perch will be on the bench again.

ARSENAL: [Previous starting XI v Wigan (H

Giroud is back, and it’s unlikely that Wenger will risk him - it could be that he plays for a maximum of 45 minutes. Wenger said that Wilshere is a possibility for CDM, but I think we’re more likely to play Ramsey at CDM to keep the core of the team intact. I’ve lined up the team on the assumption that we’ll make the number of changes possible, and just rotate some of the players around our formation.

**Tactics**

NEWCASTLE:

 - General build-up

Cisse made most of his passes [down the left and right wings](http://imgur.com/TFAuxD3) on Sunday - very few through the middle. He often came deep and wide to link up with the 3 attacking creative players behind him. Gouffran, linking up the attacking play and then making forward runs to get into the box. Strangely, when Gouffran started in a more advanced position or drifted out to either wing, Newcastle looked a bit unbalanced and seemed to struggle to work the ball forward.

Ben Arfa can play all across the AM line, and sometimes cutting inside onto his favoured left foot. We use our LB to keep us wide on the left stretching the opposition defence - whoever we decide to play there tomorrow will need to be sure they retreat quickly if we lose the ball, or we’ll be exposed to Ben Arfa’s runs in that empty space.

Both of Newcastle’s FBs will try to get forward a bit - though they’re not quite as attacking as ours

 - Set pieces

Ben Arfa is potentially a threat from free kicks around our box. We’ll need to more careful than we were in this area on Tuesday - although we Maloney’s converted free kick didn’t cost us much, which means we’ll have to stay focused when defending corners; having Giroud back will certainly help with that.

ARSENAL:

 - Finding space

Against Liverpool, Liverpool used the massive spaces behind Newcastle’s back line to break into quickly. The result of that game may encourage Newcastle to be a bit more cautious (giving us the space to pass it around in front of them, trying to create gaps), or they may decide to stick with that game plan and squeeze the centre of the pitch (which Wigan did on Tuesday and we were more than happy to exploit).

 - Exploiting their LB

Either Santon will be fit enough to come back, exploiting the space they leave behind, or breaking inside to get between the LB and left sided CB. Gutierrez may be more reserved and help to cover that wing, so doubling up with Sagna will help to break them down in this area. If we can get some good crosses in, we may even see a headed goal from Giroud.

 - How to fill the ‘Arteta Hole’

Newcastle’s main threats probably come from Ben Arfa and Gouffran. If we can keep Ben Arfa quiet, it becomes something that takes a bit more consideration.

We’re likely to start with Ramsey at CDM, marking him out of the game; if he plays in a more advanced position, Ramsey needs to leave Gouffran to our CBs to deal with, but be very watchful of late midfield runs into the box from players like Ben Arfa, Gutierrez and Cabaye.

**Finally...**

We really need a win here - and if Newcastle need anything

* Team Selection

[Possible line-ups for both teams](https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B5MSm_SLJtbKQUlMSWRkRmxaWDQ/edit?usp=sharing)

WEST BROM: [Last week’s formation/tactics](https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B5MSm_SLJtbKM2JLcXF5UTN2NTA/edit?usp=sharing) A couple of changes from last week’s line-up. Most notably, I would start Odemwingie at RM, despite his recent history - he came on in the 2nd half v West Ham and was very impressive.

West Brom played with 2 strikers against West Ham, they struggled to get the ball out of midfield into their 2 strikers to actual attack; and when defending, West Ham usually played over the top of their midfield - or on the odd occasion, passed around them. If they weren’t planning on trying to match Arsenal’s 3 man midfield, then after last week’s performance they should be. So because of that, I’ve put Brunt at CAM, putting another body in the middle of the park

So they’re likely to go with only one striker

**EDIT: Following the discussion that went on [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/Gunners/comments/1bq6ml/formation_and_tactics_for_upcoming_fixture_v_west/c991n6i)

ARSENAL: [Can’t see the selection being much different from last week’s](https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B5MSm_SLJtbKR2c3Sk5vYndiMm8/edit?usp=sharing). Podolski will probably be fully match fit again, with Cazorla coming inside to CAM, I couldn’t see Wenger choosing Rosicky over Ramsey for the box-to-box-style CM position. (Wilshere is being given extra time to recover from his niggle or whatever it is, so he’s unavailable, as is Walcott.)

Gervinho has been on a little run recently; so even though The Ox came on and did well on Saturday

Apart from that

* Tactics

WEST BROM:

 -Build up play

I’m not entirely sure how they’ll approach this game. This season they have tried to play a more passing-orientated game, Arsenal wouldn’t be required to defend very differently from they way they did on Saturday; they may have to try a little harder and do it more often, but doing a similar task. So West Brom may try to sit off Arsenal a little, battle in midfield, then break quickly. ~~But Long would probably be a better option for that type of game, and as I said earlier, I think they’ll want Lukaku in there for set pieces

 -Set Pieces

In the first 10 minutes of last week’s game, and in the process took out Jaaskelainen who had managed to get his hands on it. The ball ended up in the back of the net, but West Ham were given a free kick since McAuley fouled the keeper. This wasn’t the only time West Brom threatened from corners and free kicks, but West Brom didn’t manage to score any goals from them. Brunt and Dorrans put some great deliveries in, but either Carroll headed them away or Jaaskelainen cleared them. **This is exactly what we need from our GK on Saturday.** We need confident goalkeeping to take care of the dangerous deliveries from set pieces. West Ham would have been in a lot more trouble and definitely would have conceded from these situations if Jaaskelainen hadn’t been so confident and commanding of his area. We need that. We struggled a little with Reading’s crossing and corners, so we must improve that this week.

 -Other threats

Arsenal will need to look out for long shots. Long

We will also need to carefully track their overlapping full backs. Billy Jones had a chance near the start of the second half by getting in behind the back 4 and taking advantage of Jarvis not tracking him accurately; Long and Dorrans made some good moves to create the space, and the space he created was attacked by Ridgewell](https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B5MSm_SLJtbKTndfV0UzN1F6dG8/edit?usp=sharing). He did a good job of getting parallel to the West Ham box and trying to gets some crosses away.

ARSENAL:

 -Build up play:

We did a pretty good job of breaking down Reading's defense on Saturday. Good movement from Gervinho and Cazorla coming off the wings was instrumental in 2 of our goals, getting the ball up to Carroll and having the 3 AMs run past him onto his flick-ons. I can’t see us playing like that tomorrow, but we have scored a couple of counter attack goals through Gervinho in our past couple of league games, and we may get another one like that. West Ham’s second goal came from a counter attack after Jaaskelainen made a great clearance from a Brunt free-kick - just before O’Neil receives the ball, they have a 4v3 on the edge of the box. If we can do that, we could create a dangerous chance.

West Brom did a good job of keeping Jarvis on his left foot and Carroll on his right - they knew that Jarvis’ crosses with his right foot and Carroll’s left foot shots would be dangerous. They will do the same again this week, and we’ll need to do that too.

 -Set pieces:

Cazorla’s corners were pretty bad last week - many of them going straight to Pogrebnyak at the front post. If we manage to get some better deliveries from him this week, losing his marker and finishing accurately, giving Foster no chance. Olsson will probably try hard to improve that part of his game by this weekend, but we could still try to exploit that - IF we put in some better deliveries.

 -Other threats

We’ve got some good pace in the team. Gervinho is fairly quick, so they’ll sit back - we can use the space in front of their back 4 to create some chances.

* Finally...

This game won’t be as easy as last week’s. But we still have a good chance to collect all 3 points here. If we don’t allow them headers in our box

- Since 1970, Aguero, and Crespo.

-In this WCQ cycle

-If he is anything like the previous Argentines' number 9s

-His numbers have been on the decline since Ronaldo emerged as the Real Madrid focal point in the attack. He takes the most shots on the team.

-No forward in the world can succeed in a system where the winger takes more than twice as many shots as the two forwards combined.


He is one of those players who always seems to be a the right spot at the right time. If he is the focal point of the attack and healthy, and Tevez). However, he is a much better finisher than Aguero and Tevez. Another negative aspect about him is sometimes, he is inconsistent. (It's probably because his confidence is shaken, playing in such a cut throat place). If he plays like how he plays on the National team, he'll be up there with Suarez and RVP as the best number 9s in the world. His worth will be doubled. If he remains healthy and is the starting forward, this well be one of the best transfer steals.
