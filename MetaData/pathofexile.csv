1363881213.0,1aqkc1,New League Idea - Craftsman,sowen014,600,76,171,"So I just thought of an idea for a new league

This would not eliminate the need for IIR or IIQ

I would really enjoy this league-restriction because it would make the currency value system obsolete and the only value in currency items would come from their tooltip purpose based on what you need for crafting.  I also think it would serve as a good learning tool for players that wish to experiment with crafting without going broke or ruining the economy on SC or HC.  It may also be necessary to restrict trading between players in this league since currency transfers between leagues could occur.

Another important consideration would be how to deal with vendoring.  I think it would be best to have vendors only sell whites

What are some opinions on this?  I realize it is a pretty drastic change in the way people would farm for items

**EDIT: TL;DR** - How about a league where only whites drop

**EDIT 2:** What if all items in your inventory where lost upon death but you still resurrected in the same league (not transferred to SC)? This would make it important to keep backup high iLvl white items.

**EDIT 3:** I was incorrect regarding IIR (thanks to tattertech for correction) - apparently white items and currency are not affected by it meaning it would need a modification to be useful in this league type.",self,t5_2sf6m,1363890033.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/1aqkc1/new_league_idea_craftsman/

1363156744.0,1a7b74,I sold poeex.info to someone else. Here's why.,Ridley,548,91,408,"**TL;DR I sold poeex.info because it’s become too stressful. As much as I've tried to avoid it

Hi all

This is the final post that I’ll make about www.poeex.info because as of this moment

For me, however, and its become a hassle to maintain. Since then, most people are: constantly complaining rather than helping; constantly sending me hate mail; and constantly making me question any legitimate change I might want to make. Sure, I still get a lot of, “oh thanks man,” but after the 10th email from someone telling me that I should probably kill myself

I don’t mean to sound like a bitch

I could have never anticipated that it would become so influential - which is kind of cool, I received almost 20 emails from players telling me what an idiot I am, some accusing me of trying to break the game and profiting off of it. I was at work in a meeting when all of this happened and didn’t know what was going on. I actually had to leave the meeting and fix it to stop the emails from coming!

Ultimately, I decided that it wasn’t in the game’s best interest and took it down.) [A moderator then decided to use language which suggested to other players there was a link between the adverts and cracked accounts, ""We just slowed down from a huge spike in compromised accounts, and having a link to RMT trading readily available on a site frequently used by a lot of players, just seem to (sic) coincidental to me.""](https://www.pathofexile.com/forum/view-thread/211686/page/3#p1845220) What's more, said moderator insisted that the consensus of the community against the advertisement was reflected in the 35 PMs she had received - a whopping 0.2% of my traffic for the day. This made me quite angry, but whatever.

In my opinion,” would have been more than enough. I don’t have a record of pulling these kinds of stunts. People make mistakes. I realized that it was a mistake. It was done. Instead of that, I'm told that they're going to ""make an example of me"" LOL. Ironically, I then sold it to someone who (probably) doesn't give a care about all of this stuff and is (probably) going to post RMT ads; thus, making the problem worse.

And just as **GGG loses their shit over RMT**,” is what I hear in my head.

Anyway

**EDIT: Just a few follow up words:**

- Thanks for all the kind words.
- I should say that GGG losing their shit is more like some mods losing their, it wasn't apparently to me (ever) that Chris Wilson had his hands in any of this. I don't want to sour Chris' name because he is a total rad dude.
- If anyone is looking for the Ruby on Rails PoE project to work on
- I still love this game

**EDIT 2: [The same mod locked the thread I made about this on the forums.](http://www.pathofexile.com/forum/view-thread/252409/page/4) LOL** Talk about power hungry. Maybe I should have sold poeex to her?

----
**Difficulty levels**
----

There are three difficulty levels: Normal, and you must complete Cruel before you can move to Merciless.
The higher difficulties have death penalties, not your total experience.

Losing experience in this way cannot cause you to drop down a level. For instance if you have 11% progress to your next level and die in merciless difficulty
There are also penalties to resistances in higher difficulty levels. In Cruel difficulty

----
**Skills**
----

**Skill Types**

Skills currently come in two main varieties: spells
Any skill that uses your weapon damage counts as an attack skill

**Attack skills**

Attack skills are dependent on your weapon, etc.. Bonus damage from rings and other gear is applied when using an attack skill.

**Spells**

Spells do not draw their damage from your weapon in any way. They are affected by % cast speed, and critical strikes. Integer damage bonuses on gear are not added to spells.

**Traps**

Traps are very similar to spells

The only exception to this is Town Portal, or anything else.

**Support Gems**

Support gems only affects skills where it makes sense. For instance

Skill gem experience gain

 * Gems get experience equal to 10% of the experience you earn.

 * The number of gems you have equipped has no effect on the rate of XP gain. So having less gems equipped does not cause them to gain XP faster than if you had many gems equipped.

 * Gems are not affected by the experience penalty when facing enemies below your level.

 * Gems do not lose experience when you die.

----
**Flasks**
----

Flasks come in four main varieties: life flasks, and utility flasks.

**Life

These flasks cause you to regenerate life and/or mana when used. The amount recovered is shown on the flask as Life Recovery and Mana Recovery. The time it takes to recover the full amount is shown on the flask as Recovery Time. If you reach your maximum life and/or mana amount before the end of the recovery time

You are at 100/300 life, and Recovery Time of 8 seconds. After 2 seconds, you will be at 200/300 life, and 200/200 mana, and the mana recovery effects ends. The life recovery continues, and at 4 seconds, you have reached maximum life

Flasks can have magic modifiers that provide bonuses while the flask effect is active

When multiple flasks are used at the same time

You have two flasks
You use the first flask and gain the movement speed while recovering life. After one second, the first flask resumes its effect for the remaining duration.

**Utility Flasks**

These flasks give a temporary bonus for a set duration. Unlike the other flasks

You have a magic Granite Flask with +25% movement speed, and one second later you drink the second second flask. The result will be that for the first four seconds you will have +4000 armour and +25% movement speed. At the four second mark the first flask ends, but the second flask still has 1 second left. So you will have +4000 armour (but not the movement speed) for another 1 second.

**Flask Charges**

Drinking a flask consumes flask charges. Each flask shows how many charges are used per drink in its description
Whenever you or one of your minions kills an enemy

By default regular monsters grant 1 charge each

So killing a rare monster causes all of your flasks to gain 6 charges.

----
**Classes**
----

The main difference between the classes is their stating location on the passive skill tree. Classes also start with different amounts of attributes at level 1:

 * Marauder: 30 STR

 * Ranger: 14 STR

 * Witch: 14 STR

 * Duelist: 22 STR

 * Templar: 22 STR

 * Shadow: 14 STR

**Life/mana per level**

All classes begin with the same base stats

 * 50 life

 * 40 mana

 * 50 evasion

**Attributes**

Attributes are required to equip gear and skills. The three attributes also grant some passive bonuses:

 * Strength grants +0.5 life and +0.2% melee physical damage per point

 * Dexterity grants +2 accuracy and +0.2% evasion per point

 * Intelligence grants +0.5 mana and +0.2% energy shield per point

Therefore the +10 attribute passive skills effectively grant:

 * +10 Strength: +5 life

 * +10 Dexterity: +20 accuracy

 * +10 Intelligence: +5 mana

**Life and mana regeneration**

All classes have a base mana regeneration rate of 105% of their maximum mana per minute. For example

""Increased Mana regeneration rate"" modifiers modify the base rate. For example

Characters do not begin with any life regeneration

The rate at which you gain life from life leech is 20% of maximum life per second. If you have 1000 maximum life, although it may take time to be applied - if you leech a large amount of life during a battle, you may find that the life gain continues long after the battle is over. Similar to flasks, the life gain from leech will end if you reach maximum life.

The same is true for mana leech

I was disappointed to learn the fate of poeex yesterday

Now I wake up to learn that not only is the old currency site running RMT ads but the entire site was sold presumably to an RMT website. This makes GGG upset

**This is why I decided to add a currency system to ExileStats.** But before I get into how it actually works I want to make my a few things clear...

**Rule #1: Transparency.** I want everyone to know and see where suggested prices come from. The starting data is the standard accepted rates but as new votes come in the old ""fake"" prices will get replaced

**Rule #2: There will be no advertising on my tool.** Not just no obnoxious advertising or RMT advertising: there will be zero advertising. Ever. I prefer to run all my pages this way but this tool in particular I feel needs to stay non-profit. Even if ExileStats needed to get an ad: no ad will ever exist on this tool.

**Rule #3: Big changes might need to be made.** I put this together in a matter of hours this morning and it should be considered a proof of concept. I'm always looking for new ideas or improvements - so if you like something

**Who am I and why should you trust me?** If you're not familiar with AgendaStats, which is a site I just started putting together to organize some of my stuff. I'll save you the boredom and say I'm just a normal guy who likes stats and video games.

**Sooo...** Just [go click on things](http://exilestats.com/ex/) and let me know what you think! If I get more real votes I'll start adding more data to the details section (if you click on a rate it'll open a dialog box with a price chart, etc.).

1362779253.0,19xpk1,Suggestion: Add /players command to eliminate the incentive to multi-log characters,Zaorish9,320,60,172,"Hi GGG

Thanks for making such a wonderful game for free! I've already spent lots of time and EMTs on this game and I don't regret a minute of it. I expect I'll play and love it for a long time to come

I've noticed a growing trend towards seemingly non-intended player behavior that can be easily and simply fixed. I'll describe the (A) issue
=============================================================

**A. The Issue:**

An increasing number of players, will create 3-6 characters and then either (legitimately) park them in doorways while they clear zones, or (illegitimately) use input broadcasting to make them follow their main character and level them all at once.


**B. Why I Believe it Needs a Solution**

POE is an Action/RPG. The player controls a single hero character who, fights monsters, builds skills, and finds treasure. There are plenty of unrealistic aspects to gameplay, magic being an obvious one, but they are all done to increase the fun and the tempo/pace of gameplay. *Except* for the above. There is no gameworld-related or gameplay style-related reason why multi-logging should be necessary or advantageous in play, and yet, it is. Put simply

I don't really understand the purpose of keeping it in this state. Is it to preserve the feeling of pride of those who discovered it? But it is common knowledge now. Is it to reward strategic, they just heard about it from others.

Moreover, it provides a game advantage with players who have more RAM/computing power.

**C. One Solution:**

If this was an illegitimate action, GGG has said that it is legitimate. Therefore, why not make it simple? My proposed solution is: provide an ""Instance Difficulty Slider"" for solo players and party leaders that allows you to control the ""player-scaled difficulty/drop rate"" in an instance. This minimizes the non-gamey aspect of it: Instead of various 3rd party apps and endless Alt-Tabbing, you get 1 simple option. Problem solved.


**Summary**

With the current system, fun gameplay goal: increased difficulty in exchange for an item quantity bonus. I submit that this isn't totally logical: If this is not intended as part of the game, it should be banned; if it is, it should be made simple to select so that players' fun can continue and increase.

=======================================================

**Appendix: Objections &amp; Responses**

* *This will make some players richer and other players poorer.* 

* Probably

* *This will provide a disincentive to join a party.*

* I feel as though players do not primarily go multiplayer, if this suggestion is implemented. Players who prefer single player games will continue to play single player.
* In addition, not 100% loot, so loot% per player in a party starts at 75% and decreases for each additional player, whereas solo gets 100%. Not only that, but in each party, the most skilled picker-upper will grab the majority of good items, again decreasing realized loot share for the average-skilled player.

* *This issue is really about the FFA loot system.*

* While I believe it is a slightly separate issue, 90% of the incentive for multi-logging would go away.",,False,self,t5_2sf6m,1362809530.0,hardcore,

Remember we were all noobs at one time or another.

The first thing I want to say is that calling someone names for not knowing something **IS UNACCEPTABLE**. Bullying others should not be a part of this subreddit. Don't call someone an idiot

Lets all try to be a little more noob friendly. If someone doesn't understand something

**Example 1**

Newplayer: ""Hey guys I have this idea""

xXAngryredditor69420Xx: ""No. That idea is stupid and would ruin the game.""

No matter how bad the idea is

**Example 2**

Newplayer: ""Can you guys take a look at my build

YOLOelitistprickYOLO: ""That is because your build sucks. Reroll.""

That isn't helpful. The guy clearly already knows his build isn't great or he wouldn't be asking for help. Instead either ignore the thread or actually take the time to tell the guy what doesn't work in his build and what options he has for fixing it. 

**Conclusion**

Most people who say these nasty things are not trolls

**Sidenote**

There have also been some redditors who have been a 100% negative contribution to this subreddit. I will not call anyone out specifically but please, and generally enjoy the company of the other exiled.

Now, what GGG has done with leagues has taken Diablo 2's signature ladder feature and ran miles with it. Another great example is the trade system, where currencies have use to the character and aren't simply another stat to keep track of. These above examples are two great decisions in the games design that lead to a more complex and rewarding experience. 



On the other hand, maps have somehow managed to become one of the most rewarding and most frustrating experiences this game has to offer. Unfortunately, in this case the drawbacks to the map system are so substantial that I have had to put the game on hold until something is done about them. Too much of their design is contradictory to what the developers were ultimately trying to accomplish.





To lay it out simply

What is great about maps:

1. **Extremely diverse.** One map can be a cakewalk


2. **Extremely challenging


3. **More rewarding endgame play.** Because the content is level appropriate compared to the rest of act 3 it is much more appropriate for those few who have reached the highest level in the game. They find more appropriate loot for their level

Now



1. **Getting maps outside of maps.** I understand you wanted people to trade maps around, once you reach levels 70+, if you ever run out of maps you are stuck farming act 3 areas which have **horrendous** drop rates for maps. I mean REALLY bad. It turns what would otherwise be an exciting and engaging endgame into a monotonous farm, no better than Diablo 3's really. To add to that issue...



2. **Map diversity on rolls is inherently killed.** Remember earlier how I mentioned I loved rolling challenging maps? Well, I can guarantee I will run out of maps *very* quickly. Hell, even the front page post where the guy has an insane map roll? He mentions not even getting a map from it... I know GGG wants us to challenge ourselves with these maps, they mentioned it in interviews with TB. The problem is, in its current design, we simply cannot do that because it kills the opportunity of sustaining the maps. It is inherently flawed and ultimately kills the diversity we can opt for when rolling maps.


3. **The engaging endgame is behind a frustrating RNG.** Again, the second you run dry, the farm is relegated to a few select Act 3 areas. Docks, Crematorium, Lunaris. You will be in any of these 3 places for hours on end at hopes of dropping a map. The endgame becomes such a monotonous and frustrating experience every time your maps run dry it really just makes you want to tear your hair out. Again, this is almost exactly the same issue Diablo 3 had, a monotonous farm. Only in Path of Exile


4. **Leveled content isn't leveled and ultimately RNG.** I don't have any clue as to why this ended up as it did, the pace of them slows to a crawl as you gain less and less experience from maps as you gain levels. It makes no sense... why are higher leveled characters penalized, being forced into running lower leveled content?

**So there we have it**. On one hand, and the thrill in rolling challenging maps is lost in hopes of avoiding being stuck with the horrendous farm. Maps result in being both a source of entertainment and immense frustration for anyone who has managed to reach late game. It *needs* addressed, otherwise the longevity of the game will ultimately suffer.

So enough complaining

1. **Buff entry level map drops outside of maps** - this won't solve the problem of the farm outside of maps being ungoldy amounts of boring, there is no market for them as is. If anything this could only help stimulate their trade, as people won't fear trading away maps they can more easily replace.

2. **Stratify the drop rate of higher tier maps in subsequent tiered maps** - Having a level 66 map drop in a level 77 needs to stop as much as possible, a level 68 map has a fairly decent chance to drop in a 67 level map, and a 66 map less likely too. This way there is some actual sense of progress to the map system. As it is, level 66 maps are too common in all level maps, this needs to change so higher-tiered characters have the opportunity to run content appropriate for them, so it feels less like a grind.

3. **Give us an area to farm maps outside of maps that has more diversity** - I never played Closed Beta, without the augmented rolls perhaps, it could save the grind to get more maps from being ungodly amounts of boring and repetition.




Until any number of the mentioned issues are resolved I have personally put this game on standby, the endgame design as is is terrible, being stuck in docks for hours praying for a map to drop, getting one, rolling the same rolls to get more maps, only to not get them and be stuck back in docks for hours.... I know I am not the only one that feels this way nor experienced this very issue. 

Once this issue is fixed though, I'd love to hear them.",,False,self,t5_2sf6m,1361403577.0,,

Those locations change their level AFTER you kill Merciless Piety.

* HAVE FUN and don’t worry if you’re using the best or most optimal builds! The game is designed for you to create multiple characters and explore different item and skill combinations. Your first character is almost guaranteed to suck. So go with it and just enjoy the ride.

* Pick an AOE skill early on and USE it! You can thank me when you’re not 30 levels behind everyone else.

* To link an item in chat hold control + alt and then click the item.

* You can use ANY gem as ANY class as long as you meet the stat requirements

* Some reasons to not level up a skill gem – the mana cost of the upgraded skill may become too prohibitive or you may not have the stats required to use the upgraded skill gem.

* Control + click an instance allows you to reset that instance. Useful for farming.

* Empty instances are reset after 15 minutes. Keep those town-runs quick

* If you die in hardcore your character will be moved to the regular(softcore) league and you can continue playing them there.

* Exalted Orbs, and Chaos Orbs are the most valuable currency. Best bet is to hoard everything until you get a good understanding of values in this game.

* White items can be insanely valuable. This is because some of the best items in the game can be crafted from a white item using the aforementioned currencies. Example: Find a high base quality white weapon. Increase its quality by +20% using Blacksmith’s Whetstones(a currency item)

* Pick up: all currency items, no matter how  small, pick it up), uniques(duh), items with three color links(ex. red, blue, green socket linked together, a valuable currency item).

* White items to keep a lookout for – any item with 5+ links

* Dual wielding grants +10% increased attack speed and +15% increased block chance

* There are now three acts with three difficulty types(normal, hell, inferno. Each increase in difficulty and act makes the game noticeably more difficult. In cruel your resists are reduced by 20% and in Merciless your resists are reduced by 60%.

* You need elemental resistances. An easy way to build up resists is through rings. It’s a good idea to carry around different sets of resist rings and swap them out depending on the mobs you encounter.

* Path of Exile can be unforgiving for those who neglect defenses(like elemental resistances). Sure you  could make a full glass cannon build. But

* Be sure to pick up over +100% life or energy shield from your passive skill tree(cumulative from +8% and +20% nodes

* When making new builds plan for about 80-85 skill points. No need to get all crazy with a 120 point build. By the time you have 80-85 points you’ll have a much better understanding of where the skill points should be going. Also

* Look out for puncture. This is a skill enemies use that does five times more damage while you are moving. You are effected by puncture if you’re leaving a giant trail of blood behind you

* Don’t know how to build your character? Check out the official path of exile forums for ideas.

* You can join other player’s games by visiting the message-board in town. Friends who slay together

* AURAS. Put your aura spells in gear set II if you don't intend on using gear set II otherwise. Frees up space on your hotkeys for all your explodey needs. - EtheralScorpions

* Weapons/shields equipped in your secondary weapon/shield set (you can swap between 2) can be used to level up skill gems

* The (SC) Economy is inflating so fast you can leave for 5 days and come back and get insulted for 'not knowing the rates' that were applicable before you left. Exalts are becoming stupidly overvalued and the entire system is set up just like D3, and you don't want that. 

* Some people just like playing alone. They don't want to have to interact with people to play the game and all of it's content. There are lots and lots of asshats and fuckwads that I'd rather not be forced to go through to enjoy the game. 

I'd go apeshit over a league where no trading was allowed, it deflated your desire to play and causes a lot of people to get bored and leave. Though it isn't as bad as  D3, POE suffers from that, too, when you see chats and forums full of Lioneyes and Kaoms. 

Mainly, believe it or not, I enjoy the whole ""Killing endless waves of monsters and finding loot"" part of the game, and I don't really care about other people's big dick contests. I enjoy **using** currency items more than I enjoy having to trade them, and crafting a good item is a great feeling. I haven't found an upgrade from a drop on my current character, who is at 71, since Normal difficulty. That's just a horribly deflating ordeal. I know I can't be alone here.

The Good Stuff:

- I already spend a lot of time in this sub each day
- I am a moderator of another sub already so I know how it works (mostly).
- I love this game and community

- I'm a fan of free speech and a light guiding hand when it comes to moderation. Sometimes things have to be done for the greater good (like disabling meme posts) but overall I'm happy to let the majority determine what posts they want the subbreddit to consist of.

My Concerns:

- I occasionally post my own content here. Some might see this as a conflict of interest and there is the possibility that people would feel I was using moderator 'privileges' for personal gain.

- Possibility of me attracting drama. This is very uncommon for me but as anyone who ever does any sort of streaming or YouTubing will tell you - sometimes you just get people who hate you and want to cause drama around you. A few weeks ago one post I made had the comments filled with one person posting about hatred of me and what I do for a living. As I said

So

Follow up probing question: What do you feel a moderator should do/be? (could range from nothing/spam deletion to /r/askscience strict enforcement).

I may go and have a sleep

Edit: back! Thanks for the responses so far. To those downvoting: you only get your thoughts/opinions across if you actually write a comment!

This includes being able do dodge attacks manually instead of relying on dice rolls. I very much enjoy active gameplay and therefore have built a character with relatively weak defences but good mobility. I play him in the default league where a few deaths don't matter too much.

This generally works out very well

But in the last 30 minutes I died 5 times. None of those deaths was a direct playing mistake by me. All 5 times I disengaged using whirling blades before my energy shield was fully depleted, of course they actually only hit the air far away from me.

I completely understand that the game is still in beta and I do believe that GGG is aware of the desync issues (which seem to be more pronounced when using whirling blades). With this thread I simply want to underline the importance of fixing these problems. Should it turn out that the desync is an issue of the underlying netcode that can not be fixed easily

**Thank you so much for all of your amazing feedback. I think the list below outlines what the top 9 most popular ideas are so far. I will be leaving this post up overnight

**There are two options to how we proceed from here:**

**1) As stated above, and hold a second vote to make sure this really is the option that is favoured by most of the community (unless there is a landslide victory for a particular choice. Following this, we will have a second thread where the community can debate the various pros/cons of the stats, as well as the flavour. Please keep in mind I am still not 100% sure about what exactly we will have the options of, a lot of it depends on GGG's response to this idea.**

**2) /u/grundir has thrown the idea of putting forward his diamond support as well. This means we could potentially try and work in two items that are related to each other. I will be messaging him shortly to discuss

**Please keep your eyes open for updates and a follow up thread sometime tomorrow morning (Eastern Standard Time).**

Hi all

The idea for this thread originated with /u/beagley

In this thread

Before I go any further

Further

&gt; Hi Chris

&gt; http://www.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/17hhoo/reddit_custom_item/

&gt; I have decided to use my custom item design to do a Reddit community designed piece of equipment. I know you are extremely busy, appearance, effects, text, etc., and whether if, in the credits, if there are any limitations in terms of the item design. I personally think this would be a great opportunity to get some of the playerbase actively involved in a really cool opportunity.

&gt; My reddit username is BabrahamDinkin (same as my PoE account name).

&gt; Please advise and let me know what you think.

&gt; Thank you for your time
&gt; (Redacted)

It is my understanding that there is quite a delay in the e-mail boxes of the GGG staff

I would once again like to thank /u/beagley for posting a great idea. Any thoughts or input would be greatly appreciated!

**Item Suggestions So Far**


**1) Reddit Helm** (Needs a name) /u/shadowclaimer

&gt; From the other thread we had discussed the idea for a Unique helmet to represent the community and how much we help each other.

&gt; Effectively the Helmet would be based on the Gladiator Casque (Level 18)

&gt; Stats it would have:

&gt; Increased Armor (Its ""scaling"" stat)

&gt; Maximum Life

&gt; Life Regeneration

&gt; Other Party Members get +10% Experience

&gt; Conduit (Share Charges with Party Members)

**2) ohbi idea (Needs a name)** /u/ohbi

&gt; I was thinking of something similar in idea Facebreakers with the quirky side of things, % of mana = % dmg bonus. Obviously that idea would need padding out properly, but thats the area I was thinking.

**3) Staff of Consensus** /u/alrightandrew

&gt; My contribution: ""The Staff of Consensus."" A staff with maybe the ends looking subtly like arrows? As for unique effect: increases attack power at full health

**4) Ring/Ammy** /u/tylergalaxy

&gt; Well, ammy or helm. having effects like + to all resist, +to stats, exp boost and maybe some stuns on hit, life leech, Increased crit, etc would be perfect.

**5) Predditor Claw** /u/Condon

&gt; The Predditor Claw Weapon Applies blue slow debuff on target

**6) Shield Book** /u/spreadtheirentrails

&gt; A shield that is a book

**7) Ideal Tinder** /u/_buch

&gt; Ideal Tinder (Anagram of Reddit Alien)
&gt; Strapped Leather Armor (Or one of the ES shields?)
&gt; +10% to Fire Damage
&gt; -20% to Fire Resistance
&gt; Grants Frenzy Charges To Party Members On Killing Blow
&gt; ""The witch hunt never actually ceases

**8) Crown of the Hivemind** /u/soulefood

&gt; Energy Shield Based
&gt; +20 intelligence
&gt; Blue gems equipped have +1 lvl
&gt; Red and Green gems equipped have -1 lvl
&gt; +Maximum Life
&gt; +All Resist

**9) Bow and Arrow (Needs a name)** /u/durkdurkdurk

&gt; A bow that shoots fire arrows (upvotes) and cold arrows (downvotes) randomly.

**10) Rare Map**

&gt; item rarity X%
&gt; item quantity X%
&gt; players are cursed by critical weakness
&gt; no health/mana from potions
&gt; there are 2 unique boss mobs (together)
&gt; rare packs are 2x as big
&gt; maps drop 2x as much

**11) Topaz Ring**
&gt; Band of Karma
&gt; Topaz Ring base (no Topaz ring unique exists yet)
&gt; 25% of Physical Damage converted to lightning damage
&gt; +20-30% Lightning Resistance
&gt; Increase Lightning Damage by 0-100% based on % of current hp (at 100% hp you get 0% bonus
&gt; Cannot be shocked
&gt; ""You reap what you sow.""

**12) Rare Gem** 
&gt; Color: White
&gt; Name:Resonance
&gt;  X% chance for each enemy hit to grant a random charge.
&gt;  +Quality -&gt; +Y% duration to charges.

**13) Bone Chimes of the Tiber Council** 
&gt; Spirit Shield
&gt; Level 55
&gt; Spell Damage +15%
&gt; Movement Speed from Armour -3%
&gt; ----------------------------
&gt; All Elemental Resistances increased by 15%
&gt; +60 Mana
&gt; +45 Energy Shield
&gt; +100 Life
&gt; Protection of the Tiber Council
&gt; Bones they chime and bones they break
&gt; Protection of the Tiber Council is ""Every two seconds

**14) I'd like to see a unique claw

A moderator with a teaser

**15) Some combination of 2 custom items that build off of or improve each other**

I know that this subreddit has had plenty of GGG / PoE praise threads in the past week or two, when I look at its passive tree, or currency system, or skill gem dynamics, I'm reminded of the same feeling I had when playing WoW the first time. It's not just one of enjoyment, it's one of anticipation, because there's so much in the game to look forward to. Because there's so much potential in the days and weeks and months and years ahead. I know that I've barely scratched the surface of what this game has to offer. 

Path of Exile *is* a good game. I don't think that's a particularly new or controversial notion in this subreddit. But what really makes me excited is what it *will be* -- a great game. So while I've enjoyed the past two weeks immensely

One more remembrance, if you were lucky. People were calling spouses / siblings / room mates to log them on, an hour before they'd even left work. Even if you did get on, your time was spent playing with your fingers crossed, hoping that the servers wouldn't crash. All while Blizzard scrambled frantically to get enough hardware in place to cope with the unanticipated demand. And yet, people stayed on. Not because the game *was* good. But because the game *was going to be* good.

I understand that no one is entitle to the items. The timer solely exists to give ranged players a chance to reach it.

But character models colliding with each other makes it ridiculous. How many times have you clicked on an item and your character stopped walking halfway there because he bumped into someone else? I'm not even slow at reacting

I suppose solutions would be as follows:

-Increase the range to loot an item.

-Make it so we can walk through each other. Maybe this would allow for unfair tactics or something. I don't know. Someone should point out why we should not be able to walk through each other.

**EDIT 2**: Can also do lower lvl (66-67 maps) for people lvl 60-mid/high 70's.  Lower levels benefit more experience-wise from running 67-66 first before they hit 80.

**EdIT 3** : Due to the amount of whispers (one every 5-10 minutes from a new person haha I have decided the best way for everyone to get the fastest exp/loot/hour is to limit groups to 3 people.

-Don't spam. Especially if you are looking for a fairly rare item like a quality gem. If someone didn't have it 30 seconds ago

I have been playing Path of Exile quite a bit since it went into open beta. I just realized there is a subreddit today and I figured I would make a post that hopefully helps people. These are all things you will eventually learn along the way

----------------------------

**Quest/Leveling Tips**

* To reset instances so you can get new monsters spawns in the same place... hold ctrl+left click on mouse. This works for either the doorway to the zone or the way point node. You get a new popup window

* When you get to Bandit mission if you kill all 3 you get +1 passive skill bonus when you turn in the quest at town.

* The 2 most popular grind spots are ""Ledge"" in act 1

* Try to keep the group full and have all your members in same instance at same time. This enhances the speed and the xp bonus. 

* There is also 3+1 levels of difficulty in this game. Normal

-------------------

**Skill Passive Help**

* You do get quite a bit of respec points to refund mistakes as you quest. Do not fear the Skill forest! I still recommend everyone gets a solid game plan of the skill clusters they want to aim for early on

* Here is a link to the skill tree planner... this is great place to avoid mistake and figure out a game plan. 

http://www.pathofexile.com/passive-skill-tree/AAAAAgMB

* Another tip is if you need to spec a few points into stats that are not primary for your class

* Orbs of Respec. These are a currency items that also help give 1 respec refund point for each use. Have no fear of mistakes

* Lastly

&gt; Below are 3 examples in progression to demonstrate examples of this point. 

&gt; [Example one](http://www.pathofexile.com/passive-skill-tree/AAAAAgMAVytUrn3SIvRrF20ZLR9Ms1Aw217r5F8qfM50VQD9FLA6MDlSvDdObVgH) Let's say this is the starting point and I made a mistake.

&gt; I want to remove all the nodes I took on the right hand side leading up to the top

&gt; Now I can effectively refund out all the points on the right side leading up to the new connection point like in [Example Three](http://www.pathofexile.com/passive-skill-tree/AAAAAgMALR9Ms1Aw217r5F8qfM50VQD9FLA6MDlSvDdObVgH37CCEAelAuNJsiycVa5Eq4-m)

---------------

**Skill Tips**

There are 2 types of gems in this game

Another tip is about Gem quality

-----------------------------

**VENDOR RECIPE TIPS / TRADE TIPS**

* Vendor recipes: http://en.pathofexilewiki.com/wiki/Vendor_Recipes

* Primary things you need to save are 3 link red/blue/green items (vendors for chromatic orbs)

* 6 socket anything (if it has crappy links 3 or less) I vendor these for 7 jeweler orbs (some say try to trade all 6 socket items

* 5L and 6L items... these sell in trade for major bank... the 6L vendors for 1 divine.. so take no less than that in trade.. honestly its worth quite a bit more.

* Also, helm, boots, gloves, amulet, belt, 2x rings) all unid you can vendor that for 2x chaos orbs... if they are all id then its 1xchaos. Also

* Lastly

http://www.bitmaiden.com/indie/guides/path-of-exile-quest-rewards/

*Quest reward link updated: Thanks to Variar*

-----------------------------

**Item Level**

You can tell true item level by picking up an item in your cursor.. and typing /itemlevel

The following info is updated off forums.. may or map not be accurate

Item level needed for number of sockets:

1: 1

2: 1

3: 15

4: 28

5: 35

6: 50 (lowest seen so far)

*Update: On socket levels from Icy_Inferno*

----------------------

**TRADE TIPS**

There is going to come a point eventually when you are going to need to barter with people to get the uniques and 5-6L gear you need. Here are some bookmarks to help you navigate trades better.

Exalted, but trades are way harder with those currency types then the 4 listed above. I try to consolidate into those forms as much as I can for easy trade.

&gt; Here are a set of links you should bookmark

&gt; * Currency Exchange rates:  http://www.poeex.info/

&gt; This is mandatory link so you know what orbs are worth what!

&gt;* The full list of unique items: http://en.pathofexilewiki.com/wiki/Unique_Items

&gt;Specifically pay attention to the ranges each items stats can roll at. A perfect roll may trade for more than random scattered stat one.

**Mana regeneration is based on your maximum mana.**

This is a *crucial* bit of information. One of the mistakes I made early, the thinking goes, my goal is not to *lengthen* the period in which I can spam my skill, but to render it effectively infinite such that mana is no longer a limiting factor on my skills! This logic has several problems, but one of the biggest is the avoidance of *derived stats*. Because mana regeneration is derived from maximum mana, increasing your maximum mana pool can *dramatically* increase your mana regeneration!

A brief example:

&gt; A character has no mana regeneration items and 100 mana. His regeneration rate is 105 mana per minute, it can be used 14 times.

What else can we learn from derived stats?

The more mana regeneration you have, they'd see the *exact same absolute regeneration rate!* Why is this interesting? Because 50% mana regen is a level 50 mod and 25 max mana is a level 17 mod! Because *each point of max mana is more effective per percent of increased regeneration, the value of max mana increases the higher your regen is, often beyond a much more ""valued"" regen affix!*

The converse is also true; if your maximum mana is very high

There's a few more points to be made: each level grants you 4 mana

So with all the math aside

* Maximum mana is an effective way to increase *absolute* mana regeneration per second (doesn't affect relative MPS).
* As your increased regeneration percentage increases
* Because mana increases naturally,False,self,t5_2sf6m,1359664352.0,,,t3_17ndjg

Possibility of prismatic socket on items. Items would be **limited** **to 1** prismatic socket per item. Prismatic sockets would be somewhat rarer to roll with Chromatic orbs. Vendoring ""trash"" items with B-G-P or R-G-P or R-B-P would yield a chromatic orb.





Thoughts? Critiques? Suggestions? I don't think it would be that hard to implement it since there's already Tabula Rasa with prismatic sockets.

* Silverbranch unique and poison arrow at level 1
* LMP on poison arrow at level 19.
* Prepare 2 perpetual quicksilver flasks of adrenaline beforehand and get a flask belt somewhere along the way while leveling.

1)When you are in a group and you have gen-chat open or the trade chat the left side of your screen basically becomes a death trap. You have no idea what monsters are there. You have to look past all the UI components. 

2) Why are the icons and life bars so large for group members? I would understand if this was WOW or something like that where there is a class that can heal people and maintain people but PoE does not have that. Team life bars should not be that big

3) Final problem that I have with the UI is how instances and group members work. I don't understand why the member icon disapears if you are in a different instance. And to find out where your team is you have to hit ""S"" and than go to current group because by default its always friends list. That seems like alot of work to find out where your team is or even to see if you are even still in a group. (everyone may have left or been kicked and u did not see the text on the right side) 

So yeah

In these 2 decades i have never seen a game with such a strong concept and system. Looks like PoE completed the puzzle

I'm an avid gamer, or home insert delete pgup etc, occasionally spilling over to backspace. Because of this I often have to combine ctrl-num1-7 (can't reach 8 and ctrl)

There are currently no ctrl key combinations allowed but you also cannot bind many of the other keys I need to use at all. I tried mentioning this to Nerf in the HC general chat but I believe it got drowned out in the noise.

1367966621.0,1dw5pu,Suggestion For Passive Tree To Discourage HP Node Hopping And Encourage Build Specializing,Mande1baum,157,26,88,"TL/DR: Relocate passive %HP nodes into a single more powerful passive next to other notables in passive tree to encourage specialization and build diversity rather than %HP stacking.

It seems many 'builds' are the same path(s) through passive tree in order to maximize %HP nodes (and a few other select defensive passives) and then pick up any offensive nodes that actually define our build if they are already on the path. I hardly see stacking HP nodes as specializing into a specific build (since everyone

My suggestion would be remove many (all) of the plain 8% life nodes from the tree... and instead make them stronger (16-20%?) and nestle a single passive into the end of other nodes, you go towards the nodes that better fit/define your build and the %HP is a reward for committing to/completing a node. [This is an amazing MS Paint rendering for visual reference of a few variations.](http://imgur.com/t7ysL32).

This would also encourage specializing a build even further! Now there would be more of a reason to commit to a weapon type for melee (ax v sword v etc) or elemental type of damage (for casters) in order to reach that juicy HP bonus at end. It also frees up more passive points to invest in other means of survival (evasion &amp; armor, etc).

With the extra passives available

One last bonus would be this may open up new paths for navigating passive tree. Currently there are many alternate paths through passive tree that unfortunately require 3-6+ passive to complete the node(s) and are therefore neglected in favor of +10 attribute main paths that can accomplish the same path for less points (so more can be invested in HP...). Variety and options are good imo.

Two possible downsides are apparent to me. First is people investing in passives that have no value to their build just for the HP at end (accuracy for a FP guy for example). However, which is currently much less than the 8% or more currently available. Therefore, a HP only build is much less viable, but keeping some of the pure HP nodes in tree (such as those in middle of tree) could still be available for such builds as RF.

The other downside is it makes low life (Shavronne's)/CI a much less appealing choice. These builds would be right next to multiple single passives that would grant a substantial amount of HP for little investment that they miss out on. Perhaps CI could convert a fraction of %HP into %ES as well... like 20% HP = 8% ES. So any easy solution for CI but not Shavronne's

So I think this idea could really encourage more and better build diversity in the game. Melee builds will have an incentive to invest in more offensive nodes (like accuracy/crit) rather than simply defensive. Also, and fire nodes). Or my Dominating Blow 2H can add some actual dps or mana regen since so many points are currently invested in increased duration and minions. I guess I'm just saying that currently with the passives left after HP, you can only specialize in 2 things. By making specializing in a 3rd thing an option without spreading yourself too thin, build diversity could potentially explode!

Implementation could be a lil tricky as this would revamp whole tree (not just Duelist as in past). Perhaps GGG could just refund HP passives

So thoughts/critiques?

TL/DR: Relocate passive %HP nodes into a single more powerful passive next to other notables/nodes in passive tree to encourage specialization and build diversity rather than %HP stacking.

Bonuses: 1. More room for specialization (or min/maxing). 2. Less dependence on crutches such as BM,False,self,t5_2sf6m,False,,n7,t3_1dw5pu

Hello Community!

A group of my buddies and I have been working on a site which will convert a inputted value of currencies and outputs it as single currency value. A reason why we thought this would be a good idea is because during trades either on forums, and you can see how much it is worth in, Exalted Orbs values, GCP value or even in a Chaos Orb value.

We will be monitoring the marketplace values on currencies daily and try out best in updating the value of each currency to make it as accurate as possible.

This was made for the community so we hope that the community will also contribute and help us maintain the correct values on the currencies on the Hardcore League and Default League.

If you have any questions please feel free to send me a PM

1361434449.0,18y0ik,Rares to keep: Critique my analysis,Jeenz5,159,42,95,"Hi Reddit

I have been trying to figure out what rares are best to keep in my stash (since my stash is becoming too cluttered!).

The background to this is that most rares that you will obtain below level 50 will be from drops (since it may not be worth using currency items like orbs of alchemy on lower level items). 

After level 50


From the Mechanics thread on the PoE website:

Item level needed for number of sockets (research ongoing)

1 socket : 1

2 sockets: 1

3 sockets: 15

4 sockets: 28

5 sockets: 35

6 sockets: 50 (lowest seen so far)


I have come up with the following:

* Since support gems only start from level 12

* From level 12 to 35

* From level 35 to 50

* From level 50 onwards


So to summarise

After this point

Some other tips:

* From normal Act 2 (late Act 1) start looking for 3-linked RGB for chromatic orbs at vendors

* From cruel Act 1 start looking for 5-linked items for crafting at vendors

* From cruel Act 3 start looking for 6 socket items (links are optional) for crafting or to vendor back for 7 jeweler orbs

* In merciless difficulty if you are still using low level items

* Always check vendors every time you level up! If you are in merciless

* You could keep rares that are bad in your stash to sell to a vendor using the chaos orb recipe

* If you craft a crappy item (with 20% quality) 


For more experienced players

Have fun cleaning out those stash tabs!

1358129300.0,16ixh3,A quick getting started guide,jammak,133,15,58,"With open beta starting soon and the the number of players going to explode soon

Path of Exile is an action rpg, Ranger (dexterity), Templar (strength/intelligence), Duelist (strength/dexterity), Shadow (dexterity/intelligence). As you plow through your enemies you will discover the secrets of Wraeclast, and once you finish, you get to do it again, and 3 difficulties (normal

Skills in this game are determined by things called skill gems. You place them in your equipment to use them, but must be linked to the gem. In your equipment there are colored slots where you can place a gem, and a gold bar between them means they are linked.

Every level you gain in path of exile gives you a passive skill point, highly** recommended you plan out your character atleast a little before getting started. It is also strongly recommended that you focus on defensive stats first, and let your skill gems handle the majority of your damage. You can go pure offensive and make it a little ways, but I guarantee you will hit a large wall of death rather quickly. I will link some easy to use builds that cover each of the playstyles below if you are a little lost on what to do. 

Flasks are nifty little potions that persist after their use, Hybrid, Diamond (100% crit chance), Quicksilver (40% movement speed), Granite (4,000 armor :O), and 1 for each of the elemental resistences. They can all have modifiers, but does so instantly. Or a mana potion that gains more charge each time you get a critical hit. Getting appropriate flasks for you build is extremely important. 

Yet another unique/cool thing in PoE is the currency. It isn't money - it is either good items useful for bartering and selling, so crafting / upgrading an item to your suiting is sometimes required. It is suggested you save most good orbs (alchemy, chaos, regal, etc) for higher levels when the items you are crafting will last you for a long time. One super important gem is the Gem Cutter's Prism. It's called GCP and it's the SOJ of this game basically (a staple of the exchange rates/trading kind of).

Crafting in this game revolves around using the currency to modify items. Starting out, you will want to modify your flasks. Once you're comfortable with your build and decently far, it's a good time to maybe invest some currency into items. If you find a strong white item with the sockets and links you want (like a 4 red linked weapon if you're a 2h marauder) it's worth it to get it's quality up to 20 and try an orb of alchemy and chaos on it if you can't find good drops. Often you should be able to trade for good items, but finding the right combination of sockets and links is really hard. My marauder needs 3 red and a green for one of it's abilities, which isn't something commonly traded. However, this is where chromatic orbs can also help. If someone has a strong 4 linked item, but they're all the wrong colors

A brief run down on the orbs (reading them is also a good idea ;p )
Armourer scrap and blacksmiths whetstones improve quality (improves base stat). Transmuation = white -&gt; blue. Alchemy = white -&gt; yellow. Alteration = reforge a blue. Chaos = reforge a yellow. Augmentation = add a new property to a blue. Exalted = add a new property to a yellow. Jeweler = randomize sockets. Chromatic = randomize colors. 

Some useful buttons and knowledge :

* P - Brings up the passive skill tree 
* U - Brings up the quest menu thing/map
* Tab - Brings your minimap up full screen (can still play with it up)
* Arrow keys - Will move the TAB map around
* Alt - will show all items on ground
* Z  - Makes it so you don't have to press alt (: Suggest you make it so you have to hold a button to pick up items though
* C - brings up character panel
* Ctrl + Alt + left click - Will put an item in the chat box if it is open (press return)
* View items in chat by opening chat box and mousing over them
* Ctrl + left click waypoint or entrance - Will let you reset the zone so you can do it again.
* Zones autoreset after 8-15 minutes
* F1 will bring up ping and framerate meters
* Always build more defense / resistences with gear and passive skill tree
* ""Never"" will almost always preclude ""always"". I.E. Resolute strike is never have critical hits
* Chaos inoculation will bring your max hp to 1/1, flasks) will kill you. This also means you will be frozen for longer since its based on your max hp, and you will avoid hp passives since you're focusing only on energy shield.
* Building pure evasion is a good way to get 1 shot.
* Get resistance rings for Merveil and she is a lot easier.
* In act 2
* If a place on the main map ('u', it means there is a waypoint there. 
* Avoid making builds around a certain weapon type (swords
* Some common acronyms as follows -
CI - Chaos Inoculation, GCP - Gem cutters prism, ES - Energy Shield, EV - Evasion, 
* Check out lockdown6435's post [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/16ixh3/a_quick_getting_started_guide/c7wv3a7). Covers almost every acronym (: 
* There are things called charges, Frenzy. Endurance charges increase damage reduction and resistances by 5% per charge. Power increase critical stike chance by 50% each charge. Frenzy increase attack and cast speed by 5% per charge. They are built up through various skills and unique items. You can only have 3 when you start, but some passives can allow you to have 6 or so. That's extremely strong, and a good idea to include in builds if you can.
* Chat commands that you may find useful. /deaths - displays number of deaths. /played - hours played. /age - how long your character has been alive. /ladder shows top 10 people in the game currently on your league. 
* To talk in different channels use symbols before your message. @name message will whisper name with message. #message will display your message to global. $message will send it to trade chat (by default it is disabled

Mechanics

In this game there are a **ton** of very specific mechanics that you should definitely be aware of. There's far too many to put here


* **Most bonuses are multiplicative
* Flat damage bonus (like +7-25 lightning damage on a ring) is not added to spells or traps.
* Flask recovery does not stack
* utility flasks such as granite and resistance flasks are stacked
* Everyone's base mana regen is 1.75% of mana pool / second or 105% of mana pool / minute.
* There is a drop rate penalty for every 2 levels you are over the zone
* For good experience you should stay within 3 or 4 levels of a zone.
* Dual wielding gives you a base 10% attack speed and 15% to block. Most skills only use the main hand.
* Read the forum post if you'd like the rest


Builds

Duelist - Cool 1h rapier/shield lightning strike. Most of the gems you get from quests at the start make it easy to maintain. Very survivable

Marauder - Super plain and simple. High hp and resists 2h marauder build. Sweep and Heavy Strike work well with it


Ranger - This one's just a link to the forum post


Witch - This one's a little harder to obtain due to gems but it's really strong. Dual totems casting icespear

Recipes

When you're selling items to the merchant

* 3 linked slots of the colors (red
* surgeon flasks give you an alchemy shard
* Armor and weapons with combined qualities of 40% sell for armourers scrap and blacksmiths whetstone
* A rare from each slot ( weapon
* A gem + an orb of scouring will de-level the gem once. This is useful if you lose some stats from gear and can no longer use the higher level one.

There are a whole lot more

If you wish to learn more, so don't be afraid to ask questions. There's a lot of spam there (to be expected), so please try to research your question yourself first and don't spam global with it. You will remember things you learn a lot better than things you are told.

If you would like to see some of the excellent ideas that can come to life in this game then I highly highly recommend the build of the week videos. They showcase some really interesting ideas that the incredibly flexibility and customization in this game lends itself to. [Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CHGLWhMunM) This one shows a Shadow using Flicker Strike and  Chaos Inoculation (it's changing in open beta so this build will have to change a lot) but it's really strong. [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_EcQDOUN9Y) one shows a more creative build with a guy 1 shotting everything with his fists. It's pretty funny

I know it was removed to prevent abuse from farmers. Perhaps it could be introduced but only if you have the required quest state e.g ""Kill Merveil"".

It's like in D3 when in normal you would always get a rare if you killed the boss the first time.

While on the topic of loot; I like playing self found. At least until i get to the end game. But sometimes there are a couple of uniques that are required for the build. It would be cool if it was like in D2 where certain bosses or mobs had a much higher chance of dropping a type of unique. That way you could actually farm a specific boss or area in hopes of finding this build enabling unique. Like finding Sidhebreath from the Necro boss in Fetid Pools. You could give clues to the player of where to find them by having the mob or boss drop a note with clues of what item it has a higher chance to drop. Eventually we would have knowledge of where to farm for what item. Maybe it's already in the game just that we don't know where to farm what. Though I had a friend to farmed Merveil 200+ times and did not see a pattern in uniques.

1371828892.0,1gsrvg,Understanding and making use of PoE's economy,Timooooo,130,31,63,"Ive seen a lot of topics about the economy lately


I will start with introducing myself. I recently graduated at my university, I decided to start playing again. Ive played many RPG's in the past and I never had any trouble understanding its economy and how to make easy and quick money.


I currently have a level 70 templar with 13 pure exalted and 8 exalted equivalent (the equivalent includes a 5L6s Carcass Jack (2, and in some cases ""flipping items"". My /played time says I have been playing for little over 24 hours. This is including time standing afk in town. Im sure some of you think ""well, 21 exalted is nothing"". While this may be true, keep in mind that I got this amount by creating currency out of nothing. Getting currency from drops in maps is a lot easier, and so is finding a mirror or a Shavronne. 


**Remember


So, auction houses are like people constantly handing you free money even if you are offline. Depending on how this post is received, I could go in dept about this one too. PoE doesnt have an auction house, and uses the forum and trading channel instead. The important thing is that you know how to utilize both, which I will describe later. No auction house also means that no prices are set in stone, which causes both freedom and confusion.


Let's start with the basics:


- Rares suck

- Uniques are overrated

- Ratio's 


**Rares suck**

A harsh statement, you are at the mercy of the buyers/sellers valuation and emotional attachment to the item. Buying and selling these items are in most cases high risk while not extra rewarding.


**Uniques are overrated**

Its the opposite of what is happening with rares. Not only are uniques easy to compare, instead of a emotional attachement, uniques add a historic perception to the item (in my language we have a term for it, which I was unable to find as a translation to english using google. Maybe someone in the comments can give a wikipedia link). Let me give an example of this perception.


Example: In the next patch, Kaom's Heart would turn out to be a niche item with a significantly lower value compared to its current value. However, instead of a 2 exalted value, its price will probably only get dropped for half right away, and will stop at 6 instead. This is because people remember its high price and will not accept its new real value. This can also work the other way around (something becomes more expensive). However, people will much more easily up their price, making a smaller window to capitalize on.


**Ratio's**

We all know them; 


2 alch/scouring/fusing = 1 chaos/regret


Even though I use these ratings myself as well, they play a major factor in the constant rise of exalted orbs. However, inflation is good. It's a sign of a healthy economy. Botters make the process go faster, but inflation will always be there. Ask your grandpa how much a loaf of bread used to cost when he was a kid.


While most of the ""basic"" ratio's still apply and different botters offer different ratio's


Fusings are best, regret is pretty meh. No one wants blessed and divines.

 
Above statings are a little overreacted, regrets for chaos and keep the amount of divine and blessed at zero. People will stick to the basic ratio's, and so will you. Just dont lose sight of the botter's ratio's, so your assortment of currency is always what the masses need.


The final thing about ratio's is that it should always be rated from 1 exalted. This is because it's the only stable/rising currency in the game. Even Eternal orbs went from three to two exalted


Now


**Pricing items**

I will limit this to uniques only. Even though I have bought multiple rares during my playtime, items that are no longer verified, date and highest c/o. Looking at multiple threads should give you a good indication of what an item is worth. This does not mean that its always this easy.


Example: Yesterday I bought a Maligaro for 4 gcp and 1 chaos. I will explain how that trade went after this. I put a WTS Maligaro 1 pure exalted offer up, propose a trade with his Tabula Rasa for my gloves. When checking the price, I found 9 threads with prices between 1,5 ex and 3 ex. Problem was, that they were all verified. None of them actually sold. So, this concluded the following for me: perceived value of the item is around 2 exalted, but no one is currently interested in a luxury item like that (I consider this a leveling chest). Do I take the risk, he whispered me again after selling the Tabula Rasa for 1 pure exalted and 4 gcp. I lost out on  currency


**Buying and selling items**

Selling an item requires 3 simple steps:

- Set a price

- Make a forum post (either a auction or a non-negotiable wts page)

- Link the item once every hour in the trade channel


Out of these 3, you also close the window for a real negotiation. Instead, just offer a fair price. If they pass, just find another buyer or adjust your price. It's okay that it takes some time, you are in no hurry. When buying, the same rules apply. Set a maximum price in mind, and go with that. Let's use the Tabula Rasa. If someone is selling one, you say 3-4 gcp. If they ask for 1 exalted 2 gcp, it's easy money. If the price isnt to your liking


Because its getting pretty long and I am cutting everything short already


**FOTM (crafting)** 

If you are a little up to date, so finding those gaps in the market can be very profitable!


**Closing** 

So, I might go more in dept in certain topics. Also remember, this is just my opinion. This is an opinion based economy, and every single one counts and affects this. Mine is just as right and wrong as the next!

PS. English is my third language. I tried to translate certain words to English, please point this out in a PM. I never write such things in English, so learning from my mistakes is the best way to improve.

EDIT: after rereading my post I did not go that much in dept of flipping items. This was the main reason why I actually wrote it in the first place. I could do this in the future,False,self,t5_2sf6m,1371835225.0,,,t3_1gsrvg

As you may or may not remember, ideas, and concepts.

This thread can be viewed [here:]( http://www.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/17i11n/discussion_reddit_community_designed_item/)

Please see the e-mail below from design team member Carl Devisser

&gt; Hi

&gt; This is the email we normally send initially

&gt; First off
we want to offer my deepest thanks for your incredibly generous
support of Path of Exile.  When we started on this journey more than
five years ago
where it is today.  The public response we've received for Path of
Exile has exceeded our wildest expectations.  We are flattered by the
praise
responsibility to deliver the best game that has ever been made in the
action RPG Genre

&gt; As we are sure you know, and we're eager to help you get started.

&gt; When making a unique item it is possible to start out with for example an theme based on the name (for example death's harp)

&gt; 1. What type of base item  type would you want it to have?

&gt; 2. What sort of theme and mods are you looking for on the item? Do you want something fire-oriented maybe? Or something based on leeching? It's a pretty open design space

&gt; 3. What level would the unique have? Do you want your unique to be an end-game type thing

&gt; 4. Do you want your unique to be universally powerful,
Uniques should never outperform the best rares.

&gt; 5. As far as look is concerned

&gt; You might find this thread useful for inspiration as well.
http://www.pathofexile.com/forum/view-thread/12056

&gt; There are certain limitations on game balance

&gt; There is no rush on any of this, so let us know what kind of design you'd like for that, and we'll get started.

&gt; Thank you again for your amazing support of Path of Exile.  Players
like you not only make the production of the game possible
also the main reason we began work in the first place.

&gt; Many thanks from the whole Grinding Gear Games team!

As you can see from this message, and vote on those ideas rather then vote on every aspect of the item. I feel this will make the item feel much more cohesive and less cobbled together.

Item suggestions from the other thread:

**Item Suggestions So Far**

**1) Reddit Helm (Needs a name) /u/shadowclaimer**

&gt; From the other thread we had discussed the idea for a Unique helmet to represent the community and how much we help each other.
Effectively the Helmet would be based on the Gladiator Casque (Level 18)

&gt; Stats it would have:
&gt; Increased Armor (Its ""scaling"" stat)
&gt; Maximum Life
&gt; Life Regeneration
&gt; Other Party Members get +10% Experience
&gt; Conduit (Share Charges with Party Members)

**2) ohbi idea (Needs a name) /u/ohbi**

&gt; I was thinking of something similar in idea Facebreakers with the quirky side of things, % of mana = % dmg bonus. Obviously that idea would need padding out properly, but thats the area I was thinking.

**3) Staff of Consensus /u/alrightandrew**

&gt; My contribution: ""The Staff of Consensus."" A staff with maybe the ends looking subtly like arrows? As for unique effect: increases attack power at full health

**4) Ring/Ammy /u/tylergalaxy**

&gt; Well, ammy or helm. having effects like + to all resist, +to stats, exp boost and maybe some stuns on hit, life leech, Increased crit, etc would be perfect.

**5) Predditor Claw /u/Condon**

&gt; The Predditor Claw Weapon 
&gt; Applies blue slow debuff on target

**6) Shield Book /u/spreadtheirentrails**

&gt; A shield that is a book
&gt; +X% Elemental damage 
&gt; +X% Faster Cast Rate 
&gt; +5% Experience Only 
&gt; the best who moderated Wraeclast have read it [reddit] Or something along those lines.

7) Ideal Tinder /u/_buch
&gt; Ideal Tinder (Anagram of Reddit Alien) 
&gt; Strapped Leather Armor (Or one of the ES shields?) 
&gt; +10% to Fire Damage 
&gt; -20% to Fire Resistance 
&gt; Grants Frenzy Charges To Party Members On Killing Blow 
&gt; ""The witch hunt never actually ceases

**8) Crown of the Hivemind /u/soulefood**

&gt; Energy Shield Based 
&gt; +20 intelligence Blue 
&gt; gems equipped have +1 
&gt; lvl Red and Green gems equipped have -1 lvl 
&gt; +Maximum Life 
&gt; +All Resist

**9) Bow and Arrow (Needs a name) /u/durkdurkdurk**

A bow that shoots fire arrows (upvotes) and cold arrows (downvotes) randomly.

**10) Rare Map**

&gt; item rarity X% 
&gt; item quantity X% 
&gt; players are cursed by critical weakness 
&gt; no health/mana from potions 
&gt; there are 2 unique boss mobs (together) 
&gt; rare packs are 2x as big 
&gt; maps drop 2x as much

**11) Topaz Ring**

&gt; Band of Karma Topaz Ring base (no Topaz ring unique exists yet) 
&gt; 25% of Physical Damage converted to lightning damage +20-30%
&gt; Lightning Resistance Increase Lightning Damage by 0-100% based on % of current hp (at 100% hp you get 0% bonus
&gt; Cannot be shocked 
&gt; ""You reap what you sow.""

**12) Rare Gem**

Color: White Name:Resonance X% chance for each enemy hit to grant a random charge. +Quality -&gt; +Y% duration to charges.

**13) Bone Chimes of the Tiber Council**

&gt; Spirit Shield Level 55 Spell Damage +15%
&gt; Movement Speed from Armour -3%
&gt; All Elemental Resistances increased by 15% +60 Mana +45 Energy
&gt; Shield +100 Life Protection of the Tiber Council Bones they chime and bones they break
&gt; Protection of the Tiber Council is ""Every two seconds

**14) I'd like to see a unique claw
&gt; A moderator with a teaser

So here is the deal: Post new ideas if you have them, we will discuss what stats we would like the item to have with input from Carl Devisser. Finally, we will choose an item text flavour.

Thank you for your time and contributions /r/Pathofexile!

Theory: Docks has a MUCH larger loot table than Ledge, but lower quality.

DATA COLLECTED:

(All runs were done on a FP Mara - Running 141 IIQ and 316 IIR with 1300DPS) 

Docks: 100 runs - Yielded a total of 348 rare items - 7 uniques (one of which was a 14/66 Andy)

Of those 348 Rares I was able to sell 27 of them for 1GCP or more*

Ledge: 100 runs - Yielded a total of 595 rare items - 11 uniques

Of those 595 Rares I was able to sell 11 of them for 1GCP or more*

*When I sell an item - I start at about 150% of what I think it is worth

Total number of currency items (after vend. rares and collecting everything off the ground)

I heard some really interesting things, and personally I feel bad ""hoarding"" the info, as there are some really cool features coming:

* There will be a microtransaction feature that lets you transfer the appearance of one item onto another.

This will either be a single-use consumable for around 50 cents, you would need to buy multiple copies of the tool. Altered items will need to be restored before trading, to prevent people from trading items they've purchased.

* Act 4 will mostly be indoors. Eric didn't want to reveal much else, don't take this as gospel. As I commented below:

&gt; When I think about it
He did say that they'll have more concept artists working on Act 4 when Act 3x is complete, or maybe they've started designing some dungeons and Eric was simply referring to this.
Considering the current acts

* There will be new kinds of passives on the tree. Eric mentioned something about more hybrid nodes, so expect a lot of changes.

* There may be plans for flying microtransaction pets. This will take time though

* Melee splash is being discussed internally --- expect some changes at some point.

* Chris has an idea for smarter rubberbanding behaviour to help with desync (not sure if this is news)

* There are ideas to change the way small obstacle layouts will be generated

I.e. small obstacles like rocks will be lower in density

* Chris hates doorways. Edit: he meant this in the context of desync. It sounds like new levels will be designed with desync issues more in mind.

* There's going to be a new monster in the Dark Forest. When I asked if it's the Bear Skeleton as seen in descent

Edit: Just remembered Eric said the monster is in one of the trailers

* The boss fight in 3X is going to be very hard, to improve the current content.

I'm making this post to address and ask you guys a question about how you would like to see this subreddit moderated in the future.

Earlier today I removed a thread that had caused 20 or so reports and multiple messages to be sent. The post in question is here: http://www.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/1jopnr/so_i_was_invited_to_magic_find_this_jerkoff/ Note that I only link it for discussion purposes.

I went with my gut feeling on this one because there was no specific rules broken (other than some reddiquette violations). Ie. no personal info was posted.

The reason I am making this post rather than just removing it and continuing on is that it has a very large number of upvotes - which makes the decision to remove much harder. As such I'd like to

Here are my thoughts:

- Drama posts and witchunts are designed solely to bring negative attention to an individual or group.

- These posts tend to bring out the worst in the sub and can create a divide. 

- Even if these posts are justified there is a strong risk that eventually innocent people can be harmed due to false information or even just overreaction.

- Even if 100% of witchunts are justified

- They attract a large number of upvotes from people hungry for drama and can discourage normal discourse.

- People can end up being hurt in real life over doing something in a video game (doxing, and even stalking/violence if it goes far enough).

Playing the Devil's Advocate (note that I don't necessarily agree with these

- The sub has been slow.

- Attention should be called to people that scam/hack/cheat/etc to help other people avoid falling victim. 

- Attention can force change (usually relating to business witch-hunts).

- They can be fun/entertaining.

**So

****
*Don't just downvote if you disagree with me removing the post today

****
Edit: Thanks guys

So far it seems the majority opinion is that if the post provides proof of foul play and focuses on arguing on the actions rather than the person themselves it should be allowed.

It seems like a light hand is desired, losing their jobs etc. I have certainly seen similar posts go that way in the past on other subreddits.

The question I'd like to pose is this: If we remove posts more people might get scammed/cheated/etc. If we allow the posts someone might end up having death threats sent to their family members / lose their jobs / have their private info given out. Which is the higher risk in your mind?

****

Results of Comments Thus Far: Due to popular request I'll probably allow future posts that call people out if they do provide evidence and if they are simply for raising awareness or promoting discussion. Please do message mods and file reports if you think things are ever going too far or if your opinions shift.

1344356602.0,xtv5k,"How to ""Craft"" white items into perfect items.",Panda413,94,8,14,"Lots of new players.. Figured I would share what I know. In PoE


**Which white items are worth crafting?**

If you look at the main webpage, one that hits hard but slow, and one in the middle. For gear, there are pure armor/evasion/energy shield and hybrids of each duo combination. You want to know the names of the ones you should be looking for around your level based on your build.

*Tip: Vendors sell white items cheap, BUY IT! You can trade it to another player, or trade it to the vendor for 7 jewelers orbs!*

**Sockets and links**

Next, those can have 6. (no sockets on belts, rings, amulets, quivers) You really want to find perfect sockets and links. You don't want to use fusing or jewelers. Even if it is one link away from perfect, your first fusing could result in 0 links. There is no advantage to almost perfect sockets. Save fusing/jewelers for when you find a rare/unique and want to change the sockets. If the colors are wrong, that's okay. Using chromatics for this is fine.. But wait until you roll perfect stats. No advantage to using chromatics while the item is still white. Unlike the next step...

*Tip: You can see the sockets and links for each item on the ground without rolling over them. There are little colored squares that show the sockets and if you look close you can see the links too.* 

*Tip #2: Any item with RGB linked sockets can be traded for a chromatic orb at any vendor.*

**Quality upgrade**

Once you find a white item appropriate for your level and build with good sockets

*Tip: Use glassblower orbs on flasks late in the game to get more regen and longer duration on diamond/granite. You can treat flasks just like gear. But right now there are no rare flasks

**Adding stats**

Adding stats can be done a couple different ways depending on your orbs. In beta, you'll want to save all your best orbs for lvl 60+. You can use transmutation orb to convert to blue, then alteration to change stats. If you get one good stat like increased damage, you can use augmentation to add a stat. You can do the same with rares by using alchemy, chaos, exalted (very rare). You can even upgrade to the exact blue stats you want, then use regal to upgrade to rare

Also, or unique. From what I've read, the odds to get a rare are about 1:5. Unique is very rare, probably 1:100+. Only certain base items have a unique associated with them, so make sure to only use orb of chance on those.. Just in case.

Then there is also blessed and divine orb which can reroll the values on some stats of a currently existing item. You need to be very familiar with which values are rerolled and what their min/max is to use this effectively. 

You can use orb of scouring to remove all stats and make your item white again but retain it's sockets, you can trade scouring for regret from vendor. So if you ever want to respec, or have regrets handy for trade when other people want to respec, I wouldn't use scouring when crafting very often.

[Here is a page describing the functions of all the currency items](http://www.pathofexile.com/item-data/currency)

...

Now you have perfect gear! (assuming you had a few hundred orbs or very good luck)

Support Skills

* **Summon Melee Golem** (STR support).  Summons a mobile ally who uses supported attack skill.  Still considered a 'totem' in terms of mechanics (only 1 allowed
* **Channeling** (STR support).  Life leech, debuffs pass through totems/golems (minions?) to player at X% reduced effectiveness.
* **Riposte** (DEX support).  Supported attack skill can only be used after successful melee block.  X% more attack speed.
* **Dueling** (INT support).  Supported spell can only be used after successful spell block.  200% more cast speed.
* **Malice** (INT support).  Supported curse becomes an aura
* **Concentrated Duration** (STR support).  X% reduced duration

Active Skills

* **Mana Well** (INT active).  100% of damage done is leeched back as mana.  Alternative to everyone using Clarity/Regen, DoT, whatever).
* **Singularity** (INT active).  Pulls nearby enemies towards a central point.

Existing mechanics as support gems:

* **Ghost Reaver**
* **Conduit**
* **Resolute Technique**

New Keystones:

* **Storm Shield**.  Energy shield shatters when depleted, stun.
* **Aspect of the Wurm**.  All life leech is divided equally between energy shield and life

1362432209.0,19ntvi,Strength is over-powered in comparison to dexterity and intelligence,U_DONT_KNOW_TEAM,139,51,156,"First lets address what you get for each of the stats:

**10 Str**:

+5 Health  
+2% Melee physical damage

**10 Dex**:

+20 accuracy  
+2% Evasion

**10 Int**: 

+5 mana  
+2% energy Shield

The leading cause for strength being so strong is the **FLAT** health. This is more surviveability in the early to midgame than +2% energy shield which is the point in the game where you are lacking in good gear and thus rely on surviveability from the passive tree. 

For a comparison lets look at you at 200 health/ES

**200 health/ES +50%**

10 strength will give you 7.5 health

10 intelligence will give you 4 ES

**400 health/ES +100%**

10 str will give you 10 health

10 int will give you 8 ES

**1000 health/ES +150%**

10 str will give you 15 health

10 int will give you 20 ES

What this tells us is that surviveability-wise

Now lets look at the offensive aspects of the two.

**+5 mana vs +2% melee physical damage** 

While the + mana will be nice on the int earlygame


It seems pretty straightforward that in their current iterations

**At this point you are probably asking yourself ""What happened to dexterity?!?!"". Well I didn't include dexterity yet because I don't have a good benchmark for what your evasion is at early

However I will note that +20 accuracy seems weaker than it should be due to how strong resolute technique/lioneye's glare is.

* Change [portal](http://pathofexile.gamepedia.com/Portal) skill gem rarity to Unique. It's already rare
* Following portal gem idea
* Im always sad when I see 6S 5L item. That 6th socket seems so useless. Lets create gear support gem. For example ""Item socketed with this gem will grant 10% more health."". Obviously this needs some restrictions ; you cannot put two same type gear support gems inside single item. Imagine 1000ES 6S chest with 6x ""10% more energy shield from this item"" - thats game breaking.
* There are some effects that are available in game only from unique gear (+mana per hit) or single passive in whole passive skill tree (+2 melee range). Why not make them as unique support gems?

Things that I'm working on:

* Uniques page is kind of ugly.
* Search is half baked
* Funky characters where dashes should be (80☼100 Damage -&gt; 80-100 Damage)
* A few interface bugs

Things I'd like to hear from you:

* Am I missing any important data?
* Is my data accurate?
* What else would you like to see?

Depending on how much time I have and the community interest I'll try to get around to everything I mentioned above.

In addition to those things I was also considering adding prefix/suffix data for maps and flasks and add implicits for base types (all items) as well.

1359478820.0,17i4xg,Just found this game. SO DEEP.,Valdearg20,115,34,98,"So I randomly stumbled across this game last night and figured that I'd give it a try. Being free to play, and got a few hours of gameplay in last night. 

My initial thoughts are that the customization and character design in this game are so deep. Once I got my first level

There aren't very many games where you can roll a holy warrior archetype character and, bashing things with a glacial strike, AND summoning zombies all at once. It's kind of nuts, haha. 

In all honesty, because I really enjoy min/maxing and creating the ""perfect"" build. I think that due to the scope of the character development system, however, finding that one build is all but impossible. This allows me to experiment and actually have fun making these builds (and even entertain some ridiculous options), rather than obsessing over everything and trying to find the one ""true"" build for each class. (Note: I am open to advice, however, since I've got no idea what to expect in the later difficulties!)

Other things I like about the game: The potion/flask system, is an interesting choice. A departure from traditional design that may pay off in the long run, but I'll have to see as I play more), and the visual ""feel"" of the game so far.

Things I don't like: The inability to remap your mouse functions in game. I find it awkward to try to hit the middle mouse button, it's only the minor annoyance that I never seem to have enough Scrolls of Wisdom to keep up with the number of unidentified items that drop. Then again, it's early, and I'd imagine they become more common as you progress.

Overall, I'm quite happy to have discovered this game. It looks and feels very much like I had imagined Diablo 3 should have been. In fact, the character development system is far beyond anything I could have imagined, so in some ways, it's even better.

****

**Background**

Just before open beta [I had my subscribers choose a build](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnAaBniwHk8) from three different build options that I would then proceed to level as far as I could in a week. The end goal was to provide levelling recaps at level's ~20 &amp; 40 (to show how the build levels) and then to provide a full guide to the build at it's state by the end of the week.

****

**Full Build Guide**

Well

[BotW #1 BM Bow Duellist (Or Marauder) Full Build Guide (Lvl 63)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGZmFo-nZmM)

****

**Levelling Recaps**

- [Level 20](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOkyTeQnpRo)
- [Level 40](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBTAbp9uGuk)

My idea with these was that often build guides just show the finished product and leave out important things in the levelling process (like LA templar's using sweep to level for the first 20-40 levels).

- Poison arrow [increased duration]
- Projectile Weakness [increased duration]
- [Skelly brotem](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJqd1CfRcQ)
- Anger / Wrath / Grace and anything else you like that isn't % res.

Modus Operandi:

AoE - Curse enemies and apply posion arrow (piercing) through them. Split Arrow pierces some and then chains increasing overall amount of hits. Knockback keeps them in posion aoe as does skelly brotem.

Single target - skelly brotem and shootem till they's ded.

That's all I can think to put in a summary without going into too much detail but feel free to ask questions about the build here or on YT and I will respond (possibly after sleeping).

My forum post:
&gt; As it stands

&gt; I recently began work on a website relating to Path of Exile, and the difficulty browsing for and finding the items they want and need. Imagine my surprise when I found that not only is the retrieval of character and item data not publically available, but simple queries such as searching by character name are also unavailable to us, or are otherwise undocumented.

&gt; I have high hopes for the potential expansion of the Path of Exile community in the case that the developers improve the API available to us. It is my hope that the developers have the chance to read this and provide their feedback on these issues

**Edit:** Why the downvotes? Is an improved developer API not something you believe is needed or wanted? Please don't downvote my thread simply because you don't understand why it is important to those of us who choose to develop sites and services for the benefit of the communities of our favorite games.

1364978972.0,1bksoi,Why Magic Find on items is a Game Design Anti-pattern,kowsosoft,169,94,157,"This probably isn't going to be a popular idea

I have two reasons for thinking Magic Find is problematic:

1) It is a meta-stat

2) It tends to scale at an unbelievable rate.


For the sake of this thread, GF, IIR, IIQ, Increased/Decreased Exp%, etc.

While stats like these do have a place, players deliberately wear worse gear to accommodate their Magic Find stat.

This is dumb. If I have a great item

The second problem is the scaling. It's very easy in Diablo 3, but the problem is that 100% Magic Find is the equivalent of doubling your overall damage output. You aren't actually killing anything faster, but you're getting 2x as much loot from the things you do kill. Let me repeat the operative point here: If you could increase your damage effectiveness by 100% for relatively cheap, would you do it? Of course. That's what magic find simulates. Even numbers like 25-30% would be really impressive, and you can get values like that off of single items in PoE. Also, IIR and IIQ scale off of each other, making the scaling issue even worse in PoE.

I noticed this whilst watching [Kripp's video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X7Pk1pEKh7I) where, it only reflects 7 damage to melee attackers. 

What makes damage reflection so underwhelming is that:

1. The damage reflection does not scale no matter what depending on the level of the item

2. It only applies to melee attackers
3. It does not have a variant for spells

The 'thorn' property is in a very bad state right now, nor that every item with the thorn property should all reflect damage from all attackers (not just melee) but it would be nice to see different variants of thorn to apply to ranged attackers and spell damage.

Literally every CI build I have come across is more surviveable and does more damage if you take away CI and repurpose the ES nodes. 

This comes down to a few factors:

1. Health Nodes give more health than ES nodes give ES. While the weakest of each are both 8%

2. Health Nodes are more convenient. To get a good amount of ES you need to venture into the middle of the tree. The middle of the tree (apart from a few keystones) is weak. We all know it. Its filler and should be avoided if possible. 

3. Pure ES gear means no armor/evasion. This means that you will be very squishy against white mobs.

4. ES needs time to regen so its not very good with any build which will be taking damage consistantly (even in small amounts). 

5. Status effects. Since status effects are based upon percentage of health you will be shocked, and ignited far more often with CI. 

6. The 50% chance to ignore stuns WILL NOT prevent you from being stunned in most situations. This is because it is more common to take a few hits than simply 1 (except on bosses

7. ES doesn't work with pots.

8. In order to get ES to work with lifesteal it requires getting another keystone. (I also wonder if the 20% limiter is shifted to ES or stays on health). 

I think ES needs a buff. I think it was over-nerfed in CB due to its appearance of being OP due to the fact that endgame it gives you a much larger pool. This pool has so many downsides that I am not sure it is worth it even if doubled your health. (although if it did it would allow you to go for the hybrid ES/AR or ES/EV). 

Also I don't feel like chaos damage is punishing enough. If it were perhaps I would better understand going CI. As is the only place where CI really helps you is Dread Thicket and Chaos damage maps (which health regen can usually beast through anyway). The flipside to this is that Blood Magic maps are unrunable by CI users.

The goal is to survive in hardcore without being able to choose your passive tree

TL;DR : Create a hardcore character, choose the next passive node randomly, deal with it :D

EDIT : Some optional rules proposed by solistus in the comments :

* You can skip any keystone and pretend it's a dead end instead. That way
* For nodes that only work with shields, etc.: you have to take whatever the dice tell you to take up until you're using both your main and alternate weapon slots, then you can skip nodes you won't be able to use. If you've already taken nodes for both 2-Handed Weapons and Dual Wielding, you can skip Shield nodes.
* When you move up in difficulty, it discourages players from farming levels on a lower difficulty before moving to the next one.
* Your rules don't mention this either way, so use wisely. Like RNG crafting for your passives ;)

**[Video Guide: The Easiest Beginner Build - Tanky Blood Magic Lightning Arrow Ranger](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCJs79oLPk8)** &lt;-- All of the following is explained in here in audio/visual format if you prefer that way of learning!

****

****

**The Build: Tanky Blood Magic Lightning Arrow Ranger** 

*Heavily influenced by Petrov's Builds

**Skills:**

- Lightning Arrow - Your main skill. Powerful AoE

 - Recommended Supports: Lesser Multiple Projectiles + Life Gain on Hit OR Life Leech + Chain OR Pierce + Faster Attacks + Weapon Elemental Damage. I usually use pierce while levelling and then either buy or find a chain sometime in merciless. Pierce is very strong but chain is a lot easier to use and works better with life gain on hit so it's well worth getting.

- Frenzy or Elemental Hit: Single Target DPS. Frenzy is great all round and available as a quest reward though Elemental hit can be very powerful with a fast bow. The only problem with elemental hit is that it can only be found as a drop

  - Recommended Support: Faster Attacks + Weapon Elemental Damage + Life Leech + Added *X* Damage

- Wrath + Anger + Grace: All can be supported nicely on blood magic and work well with the build.

- The [Skelly brotem](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJqd1CfRcQ) OR a Decoy Totem OR a Rejuvenation Totem.

- Enfeeble + Elemental Weakness OR Projectile Weakness. Elemental Weakness is the most popular but I personally prefer Projectile Weakness as it synergizes well with Pierce and can give you a lot more potential damage. You can use proj weakness until you get chain and then switch to ele weakness if you like.

**[The Passive Skill Tree](http://www.pathofexile.com/passive-skill-tree/AAAAAgIAAnEEswUtCC4MfQ48Dq0QfxQgFE0UcRR1GNsZLhmFGY4aOB0UIWAkqiftKLUppTIJMok1kjboNuk6UkCgQapDnEp9TshQR1BQVElVxlYEVvpX4lhjWfNfP2BLYIhhUmOnZp5noGe9cql0QXTtdPF35XrvfNmGYId2jM-PRpBVm42boZ65n8uiAKcIpzCnhKyqr-u4k7ndwBrB2MaextjPZdDQ037Uj91G37_jaudS7Djtg-4O7m_vDu9O8B_yL_ZI9zL46_rS_E78xQ==)** - *Slightly modified from Petrov's build

**Gearing:**

- Pure Evasion gear is best! You have some evasion nodes and you will get the most armor from wearing pure evasion gear. That said

- Life! Life! Life! As a blood magic build with a lot of %Life nodes any max life mods you get on your gear will help you a lot.

- Elemental Damage mods and attack speed. These will scale the best and give you massive boosts to damage. You will still also leech from ele damage thanks to the way the Life Leech gem works.

- Avoid Crit chance/multiplier and accuracy. All of these mods are useless thanks to taking Resolute technique.

- Resists are always important. Attempt to max the elemental resists and try to aim for at least 0% chaos resist in merciless. 

- Weapon Elemental Damage mods on jewellery

Edit 1: I've tested with all the gems that I currently own and the wiki page is updated to show this.  Until I find more gems or you guys contribute I won't be able to update any more of it.  While a better way to organize all this would be beneficial

The problem is that support gems can't be mapped to which skill gems are compatible/incompatible by that skill gem's categories (examples are categories like ""Spell"" or ""AoE"").  For example, yet works on Spell Totem, which is also a spell and a totem.  It matters if the skill does damage or not.

So, which can be pretty long.  But on a wiki page there will be links so you can skip forward to whichever gem you want to view.

Edit 2: Can someone test Conversion Trap + support gem to see if the support gem affects the turned mob?  I know with Summon Skeleton or similar skills gems like Added Cold Damage do apply to the minions.  But

EDIT: Some of the feedback here has been fairly constructive. Let me offer a few alternatives that might address some issues.

Different weapon types could very easily inflict different sorts of status effects. Hammers could inflict area of effect stun (duration based on size of physical damage), and poison, swords could... do... something, etc. This would allow a diversity of effects that cater to different playing styles.

Less than a week ago

Now prices are absolutely skyrocketing. Exalts are being bought/sold for 7gcp, rather than 3. 

Prices on [ExileEX](http://www.exileex.com) are reminiscent of the ""old"" conversion rates, are showing these crazy exchange rates for high level orbs.

I can't think of a good reason why these prices are getting so high in the last week

Either we have reached a critical mass of high level players who are using high level orbs (GCPs, so we have an overall shortage of these high level crafting orbs. Plus, people get desperate and impatient and want their orbs asap so they start over paying.

Or, and so rather than high value orbs increasing in value, low level orbs are actually decreasing in value. This doesn't explain why there is such a sudden change without cause.

Thirdly, and given how recently the site [changed ownership](http://www.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/1a7b74/i_sold_poeexinfo_to_someone_else_heres_why/), I have an alternative theory. The employees at the Real Money Trading (RMT) website that now own PoeEX have been buying up high level currency in the hundreds, and now have slowly been building up the exchange ratios in favor of their high level currency so they can make a decent profit off of gaming the exchange ratios. When you compare PoeEX to ExileEX, you see that ExileEX is slowly catching up (through voting, most likely because people are being influenced by PoeEX) but is still reminiscent of the rates before this massive change recently.

Hello Diamond Supporters!  

First I’d like to make a correction to something I said last week. I attributed Pillar of the Caged God to the wrong supporter

**0.10.7**

0.10.7 was released on Friday last week. It contained four unique items

Acton’s Nightmare is a unique map was made by IronCageSkirt. It is an item with a very top down design. By top down design

As Acton’s Nightmare is based on a being in a music box, wrote and recorded the music box music used in this map.

Both top down and bottom up design can work well. We have items made from lore or idea first

Thief’s Torment was designed by Davros70. Davros70 wanted the item be be based on a base type that did not exist in the game, so the Prismatic Ring was added to the game.

We had intended to put Davros70’s ring in shortly after Open Beta, and (2) the ring can be placed in either of two slots, and needs to disable the other. This led to the issue not finding enough time in the schedule to have attention devoted to it and it ended up with a few delays.

**0.10.8**

We have our production schedule for unique items a little askew at the moment. While we have been getting unique items in

I have a pile of information sent through from supporters to make sure our unique pipeline is restored and underway. Luckily we now also have Rory working hard on unique items as well. We do have Mark having a well deserved holiday very soon. As our primary programmer for the special mods we need for unique items

0.10.8 should include an Amulet from Tertium_Quid

**Insider Info**

This week

Andrew started at GGG at the very beginning of 2012 as our resident audio engineer and sound designer.

Andrew very quickly proved his worth, and has had a hand in pretty much every sound you hear in the game. His job is to create and mix all the audio that goes into the game. This involves making ambient sound for the game levels, sound effects for monsters and skills, working with voice acted dialogue and now even occasionally writing music.

Before GGG Andrew worked as a full time DJ until starting a job for IOS audiobook developer Booktrack. This is his first job in the gaming industry. Andrew studied at SAE for a diploma in audio engineering.

Hello Diamond Supporters!  

It has been a huge week! 0.10.5 was released last Monday

**0.10.5**

0.10.5 was delayed

It also included two diamond unique items

Darkray Vectors has a couple of interesting elements that are worth mentioning as they affect those of you with uniques with potentially very powerful

In out internal balance testing, I’ll be making good on my promise to Sleekray and buffing the item.

Pillar of Caged God has also had its power level argued about

The other two unique items in 0.10.5 were Tabula Rasa and Icetomb. Tabula Rasa has impinged on some design space that some people have asked for in their Diamond Unique items. We did feel it was worth putting in as designed (in this case Tabula Rasa is an Erik design

If you present an idea for an item

**0.10.6**

0.10.6 was a smaller patch. Searing Bond was the skill introduced, it doesn’t play well with our existing supports.

The diamond supporter unique items included in 0.10.6 were Soul Mantle from Durentis

Both Soul Mantle and The Coward’s Trial took a lot of time to develop.

They both covered something we wanted to do internally, and a map with a different style of play. Both required a lot of testing and changes. The Coward’s Trial was also presented at the same time as another undead themed unique map with interesting elements.

For the Brother Laz items

I mention this, I did like the idea a great deal, but I wanted to mention the problems it would have, and what elements wouldn’t work. In our internal discussions for GGG items, this would normally lead to comments defending ideas, discussion of what we’d need to change, under what conditions we could do something like that.

If you get a comment back from us that sounds like a flat out no, and don’t take it personally! We are used to tempering by fire in our creative process.

**0.10.7**

After all that discussion, an amulet from Tertium_Quid, a ring from Davros70. We also have several items that have been sitting almost ready for a while that need something that has proven a little harder than first imagined, including items from Devoware, NuclearRaven and Kohrock. We also have many more items which are close, or we are keen to get started on.

Rory and I are hoping to get back to many of you soon. Also feel free to contact either of us regarding your item.

1363617629.0,1aixmq,Playing on Hardcore - ¤4 Reasons why it is so fun,SleepOnTheBeach,162,91,168,"**Playing on Hardcore - ¤4 Reasons why it is so fun**

1. The economy. Items exiting the HC economy on character death fights inflation

2. Tighter builds. HC forces you to take defenses, etc. more seriously. I know some people think the need for hp and defense stacking in HC is excessive, but I'm a min-maxer at heart and I love to find efficient builds within the constraints imposed by the game. One of those constraints right now is that a huge hp pool is not optional, so for me, that means the goal is to make sure my hp stacking builds are better than your hp stacking builds. And if my build fails, I can start from scratch and test out a new variant in an attempt to make it even better. Iterative improvement is the path to wealth and glory!

3. Better players on average. I don't mean this to be a flame on Default players, the pool of active HC players naturally self-selects for people who are reasonably good at the game, and interested in learning about its mechanics. People who don't fit that criterion tend not to enjoy HC, or at least not to progress very far. Anyone who is able to get to 'endgame' and stay there (or level a new character to get back to that level if their current main dies) has to have a pretty decent grasp on the game. Even less successful HC players end up thinking more about survivability, about what sorts of things tend to kill them and how they can avoid those deaths in the future. 

4. It feels like a Roguelike. I grew up playing this sort of game, I like the fact that my stashed loot is the real way to track my progress long-term, not my current roster of characters. Rule of Acquisition #102: Nature decays, but latinum lasts forever.

So, as well as appreciating the indirect structural consequences that introducing permadeath has on the economy and on player builds and behaviors.",,False,self,t5_2sf6m,False,hardcore,

- Leave the rule as is
- Remove the rule and allow said posts in the sub - let the upvotes decide.

**Chests**:
In general, refer to the spreadsheet.  Based on what I've seen, I'm inclined to believe that sockets are randomly generated when the gear in chests drops (other than starting gear) - I'd like a bit more information to confirm this.

* **Provisions:** Class Starting Weapon Set, and 2x Wisdom Scrolls.

10|Gems|Class Specific Gems|Class Specific Gems

**Weapon Sets:**  These are the items that will drop from the alluring or curious weapon set chests.  I've extrapolated a bit from sparse information

 * Duelist: 2x 1h Swords
 * Marauder: 1h Club
 * Templar: 1h Sceptre
 * Witch: 2x Wands
 * Shadow: 2x Knives
 * Ranger: Bow

**Zones:**
Monster levels

* 1-6 are normal difficulty.  
* 7-12 (starting at the Frozen Abyss) are cruel difficulty.  That means negative resists and higher monster damage.  
* 13-15? (starting at the Desecrated Shrine) are merciless difficulty.  I was able to confirm the monster levels up through dungeon 11

**Tips:** 
(These are merely observations from watching too many Twitch VoDs

* Duelists are OP.
* The same principles that apply to normal races generally apply here.  Area damage is prefered over single target
* The Quicksilver Flasks chest should be considered a mandatory choice for any competitive run.  Also
* Some zones (e.g. the Statue zone) are unlikely to be worth clearing for most classes (i.e. not duelists). It seems to be better to more fully clear zones like the skeleton and monkey zones to catch up on levels.
* You don't have to kill the boss to proceed.  While the boss can drop nice gear
* The bosses for a few zones are after the reward chests.
* Once you've zoned into the next dungeon, you will be returned to the beginning of your current dungeon.
* Your final level still counts for race rewards even if you die.  
* Transmute Large/Greater Life flasks for instant recovery (Seething/Bubbling). -credit: Shaoxy

 
**Sources:** I compiled most of this information through a combination of Twitch Vods and the two public indexes.  As of right now any information I was only able to find on the public index is followed by a (?) on the spreadsheet.

**Edit1:** Added links and improved formatting.


**Edit2:** Corrections since the first race:

 * Marauders Support Gems from Statues swapped to correct positions 
 * Templar Anger and Lightning Strike gems corrected as well.
 * Various cleanup work.
 * Please: if you used this and found anything incorrect, but until its 100% verified, I'll keep maintaining this.

Two-handed swords are underpowered in comparison

Now damage may be taking into consideration but from what I have experienced it seems that they both have the potential to deal roughly the same ammount of damage.  Although I would give the slight edge to bows. 

edit:2H Vaal Greatsword 110.6DPS 2H Vaal Axe 125.9 dps 1H Legion Sword 65.4dps 1H Infernal Axe 75 dps
Harbinger Bow 64.8 dps Thicket Bow 58.1 dps.
however

Now attacking from range already has its upsides. Although lightning strike effectively could make twohanded swords a ranged attack. 

What it comes down to is those extra stats that a bow user gets and the twohanded sword user does not.  This seems inherently unfair.

Hello Diamond Supporters!

0.10.4 included just two diamond uniques

There was a lot of discussion on the forums about the strength of both these items. There are arguments on both sides of the overpowered/underpowered side for these items.

We’ll certainly be keeping our eye on these, and how well they compete with other items in the same slot.

0.10.4B

As was announced

However we were still keen to patch in new uniques and cosmetic microtransactions.

0.10.4B will include 4 diamond supporter unique items, Carkasjak and Zinger86

One of these is a map (but still not the one that was delayed from a past patch

- Magic the gathering inspiration for the 4 month leagues

- A massive change is being pushed to move some nodes in the marauder tree out to places that make more sense. 

- The new unique 1 handed axe got hit with a 25% nerf just prior to being released in its current state. Yes its still insane!

- Want to revamp a unique server wide.....12 hour realm downtime.

At the end of the week there is also the New Zealand Game Developers Association conference. ( http://www.nzgda.com/news/nz-gdc-2013-programme-announced/ )

Most of our developers are attending

After that, one of my favourite boardgame designers. I am excited to go to this event, as before working at Grinding Gear Games, I designed boardgames ( for example Endeavor - http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/33160/endeavor ). As the event is in the Coromandel, my family and I were going to have a few days exploring this part of New Zealand.

Next week Rory will be writing the newsletter.   
   
**0.11.1**
   
This patch includes three main elements:

- a refactor of our damage stats systems

- new art and names for helmets

- support for Descent

As well as those features

There is an Occultist Vestment from Nuclear_Raven that has been almost ready for several months

AriesEMP brings us the first of our unique flasks. There are more to come!

We have a knowledged themed Paua ring coming from iamaCyborg

We are also trying to get two high level spike items completed, both so it is strong enough, and that it doesn’t become too dominant in play.   
   
**Insider Info**
   
Mark “Neonspyder” Roberts initially started off as a player of Path of Exile. He was based in Auckland

Mark (or Mark2 as he is internally known) turned out to be very useful, and then still maintain a top 20 position in the one month race.

Mark came to GGG with a good knowledge of games, and describes his study as “getting his degree and playing MMORPGs”.

As well as doing QA and balance testing, Mark has used his game and race knowledge to plan the chests for the Descent.

Near the end of each Descent level, the other is destroyed.

Mark developed the contents of the chests to provide interesting and challenging choices. They will provide remedial and interesting options for new players

I am really looking forward to how players tackle the Descent races. I am especially interested to see how the strategies develop as players play through this race type throughout the season.

You can see a picture of Mark here:

**0.10.7b**

Today

We were only able to squeeze one Diamond item in this patch

One thing I thought I would discuss about unique items is the 2D art. At the moment, but it can start with both the classic pencil and paper, or using a 3D sculpt in zbrush. Either way, the last step is photoshop, where colour and texture are finalised. To be efficient, larger versions of the Icon art are also used as concept art for when the item gets modelled. The high resolution versions can also be used as promotional material, like the large art on the race reward page on our website.

To give you an idea of the quality and size of art that is first produced

[Link to last week's thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/1apbj4/wiki_wednesday_2/)

Wiki Wednesday is the weekly event where we remind everyone that a good wiki will help Path of Exile attract and retain more players, don't contribute to the wiki, who will?

Last week, players are going to be looking to the skills page to learn about the gem's requirements, damage output, interactions with supports, and other details. We need to make sure that info is added as quickly as possible while still being accurate and maintaining good formatting.

But it's not just new skills that need work! A lot of skill gem pages either have missing information ([Incinerate](http://en.pathofexilewiki.com/wiki/Incinerate)) or may have incorrect information (such as [Culling Strike](http://en.pathofexilewiki.com/wiki/Culling_Strike) and [Item Rarity](http://en.pathofexilewiki.com/wiki/Item_Rarity) where the XP table appears to be wrong or out of order). I also suspect that some gem pages may not have been updated to reflect patch changes where skill requirements or damage have changed.

We need **YOU** to do your part! Take a look at the skills you use and compare their stats to what's shown on the skill gem pages. Found an interesting or unusual skill interaction

2. **Auto-acquire targets on most melee skills if in range.** I like playing assassin-esque, and just keep running through the map holding the button down, while my char slices and dices everything in range. Currently, most melee skills feel unresponsive, randomly moving or attacking in place when no enemies are near. This should work with aoe attacks like cleave too - it should just start attacking once an enemy is in range.

3. **Limited time leagues** - instead or in addition to races. One and three hour and other races are a great idea, say, a one hour league, meaning that my HC character would live for exactly one hour gametime before being moved into three hour league, and after that, one day league, perhaps one week - and then moved into the permanent HC league if it didn't die. Sorry if this was suggested before. (Of course, perhaps just integrating it with the default HC league,False,

The issue, there's some variation in who will use what Aura, but to a certain extent every build has to take advantage of using as many Auras as it can, because they are all incredibly powerful and incredibly easy to stack by abusing certain mechanics.

1.) Highest possible move speed.  This is the bread and butter of my build.  I'm making sure to grab all the movement speed nodes on the passive tree (except for one 2%er in marauder) because obviously getting to the loot faster than anyone else is important.  Moving faster allows you to rush ahead of your team and open all the chests and clear all the trash and jack all the loots.

2.) Frost wall.  It doesnt do much until you get high cast speed, and you will get kicked if you use it too much.  Save it for those chaos orbs / uniques etc.

3.) Big AoE dps for trash clearing.   Rushing ahead of your team only gives you a few seconds to work with before they catch up.  Killing bosses isnt realistic

4.) Knockback.  You want to push the mobs in to an ideal space for frost wall to be usable.  Also good just to push the mobs off the screen of your allies as they are about to die so they dont even see that they have looting to do.

5.) Tankiness.  Once you have met the other criteria

So thats what I've come up with so far.  Please help me refine my build!  What have I missed

btw as far as I know minions do not block movement or else I would have them in the build as well.

EDIT1: Forgot to include lightning warp / leap slam

EDIT2: My first prototype for this build was poison arrow ranger.  The strength of the ranger is how close they start to the Celerity node (8% move speed) and the 3 increased duration nodes.  The main problem I had was finding enough int to keep leveling up frost wall.  Also, so I will keep it in my shadow spec for that purpose.  Made it up to mid 30s with the ranger this last weekend.  I jacked tons of good loot (no uniques yet!!!) even with this unoptimized spec, and almost never had any of my loot taken.  I try to be sneaky with my shenanigans and so I only got kicked once, and even then the leader wasn't sure who the ninja was and kicked multiple people just to be rid of me.  It definately helps to be polite in team chat to keep the attention off of you.  Make sure its you that drops the tp's for newcomers, and be as friendly as possible.  I probably won't get too involved with tracking my loot income but on a subjective level it felt like a lot more loot was coming in than with standard play.  The shadow build looks to be much stronger and I'm gonna focus on getting him up to speed this week/weekend.  

EDIT3: A witch and I ended up partying for most of last night with a full party of various randoms that would come and go.  She was also playing competitively for loot and at such low levels (not many movespeed nodes, and so as the lightning boss (forget the name) was getting low on hp she positioned right next to it to be as close as possible to the soon-to-drop loot.  Unfortunately she wasn't tanky enough and got basically one shot right before the boss went down.",,False,self,t5_2sf6m,1361909110.0,,

Greetings

This is a friendly weekly reminder that the unofficial PoE wiki (http://pathofexilewiki.com) is a critical part of the community, as well as discuss changes and additions we'd like to see.

Last week we focused on the [**Quest Rewards**](http://en.pathofexilewiki.com/wiki/Quest_Rewards) page, who got the new Arctic Armor skill added to the quest rewards page quite promptly. Thanks, Kuryux!

This week

* [Templar](http://en.pathofexilewiki.com/wiki/Templar)

Currently, but others are missing the transcription completely, so it would be nice to try to get ALL the voiced lines transcribed.

I'm not sure what else might be good to add to these pages, that **build recommendations should not go directly on the class pages**. Instead, links to external sites or discussion pages are more appropriate. It would also be nice if people would clean up any typos, error, or formatting inconsistencies they come across.

**Questions:**


*Build and leveling:

- How do i check others' build, or Can I? (is there a website like d3 or wow)

- I'm trying out templar discharge build and just got my discharge gem from a quest reward

- Any good

- I've got my 2nd enduring cry gem after leveling another character and getting it as quest reward

- Leveling curve

- What's the level equivalent to end of inferno diablo mp0? (the level before 'farming end game content' begins)

- What are maps? end game content?

- How does drops work in POE? Is it phased


*Stats:

- What is energy armor? Is it total absorption or is damage still going to go through to hp after getting hit?

- What is the element 'Chaos'?

- Are there any penalties for resists on higher difficulties?

- How does armor work? Is it only for physical damage?

- Can i put 2 of the same support gem to link with a skill gem? for instance 2 chance to ignite with discharge.

- Are there any sites or resources that explains the massive passive tree bonuses like


*Currency:

- Do i use them while leveling?

- Where can i get information on the exchange rates?


*Trading:

- Can i survive without trading? (solo play mostly)

- How does the shops and trading forum work?

- Any sites or information on the shorthand writing of currencies?(like faq

****

[THE NO IMAGE POSTS RULE](http://www.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/1d8zvx/modpost_have_your_say_no_image_posts_rule/)

There were two fairly popular themes to how this should be dealt with:

- Replace the rule with ""No Memes

- Self Posts Only

Overall, trial it and re-evaluate it and decide if we need to go to self posts only in the future. If popular opinion changes in the future and the general consensus becomes that non *""No Memes, Image Macros, Loot Drops or Funny Pics""* image posts are ruining the sub we can make some more changes.

****
****

[THE NO TRADE

Thankfully one particular theme was by far the most popular for this one

- Giveaways are fine

As such we will be changing the rule to say simple ""No Trading Posts"". 

PRICE CHECKS will be limited to the 1-2 weekly consolidated PC threads. It seem agreeed upon that these threads can provoke interesting discussion that can be learned from.

GIVEAWAY posts, contact people and interact in the comments then throw it some upvotes!

[TAGGING POSTS](http://www.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/1d90f2/modpost_have_your_say_tagging_posts/)

The general consensus was:

- Should be optional and not enforced

For now we'll be sticking with voluntary, uses the flair system. We'll see how this basic method goes first though. I'll update the sidebar with some suggested tags but if no tag suits your post feel free to use your own, within reason.

The UBERGODMOAD 200 Run quest.

I am also going to run 25 Lvl 66 maps - Only mod will be 4x Chisel to keep the variable consistant. Will only be running the DUNES map. (this is going to be hard

I will be running each run with 225 IIR / 75 IIQ - This seems to be the cap where they start to hit DR. This will also afford me some more DPS and resists to allow the maps to be cleared without looking like a scrubcore baddie. I can calculate just how fast each run is quite easily using this method.

The rules::::::::::::::

Docks and Ledge:

~Each run will 100% explore the map (entrance not required as there are no mob spawns)
~Each run will 100% clear all the magic and rare monsters found
~All Rares will be left on the ground
~Any uniques will be picked up instantly in case of crashes

MAP Rules:

Maps will be cleared of EVERY mob - Only the total Blue/Yellow mobs will be counted + 1 for each map run (The boss...)

This week we have our Executive Producer, Brian provides a lot of direction to the game design, as well as writing.

You can see his work most directly in the flavour text of unique items and Keystones, but it is one of the harder writing jobs.

He worked extensively with Erik to formulate a lot of early plot elements, before Edwin McRae joined the company.

1360270215.0,18346s,"Why I disagree on most posts about crafting, and how I think about it in general.",Morsexier,86,28,http://www.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/18346s/why_i_disagree_on_most_posts_about_crafting_and/, I feel as though we can try to view the process from the perspective of maximization of outcomes.  
  
There are 6 possible stats on a rare
  
* Maximum efficiency
* Minimum efficiency, hopefully 2 other good stats.(1 chaos in 50?)
* Perfect rare (duh obviously) 5 or 6 stats all of high or highest quality.  (1 chaos in 200?)
      
The issue I take with how many people think about crafting comes from several perspectives. 
  
* Almost always better to trade for an item. --The examples of people who chaos or alch once and get a crazy item are anecdotal
* If people operated solely on the above
* The odds of someone creating\finding a rare that is so good that they also wont use is fairly low (but does still happen). Example--  Inva finds his crazy dagger
  
Your objective should therefore be to leverage your currency in such a way as to maximize your possible outcomes. 
  
In my mind to do this you need to decide for yourself many the values of certain items in relation to each other.
  
**Long wall of text about crafting:**
  
When you transmute and alt an item to maximize two stats, a regal and an exalt. Let’s just assume it took 30 alterations to get a very good blue you would regal. So basically a 5 or 6 stat chest in trade chat at this point must trade for 1 exalt, 1 regal, and 30 alterations in currency for this method to even have the potential to break even (though in reality, your regal and exalted orb fail far more than they succeed.)
  
However, I think we need to take a look at the true value of an exalted. The value is derived from two parts, its rarity in the general economy according to our understanding of the drop rates, and what the orb actually does upon consumption. 
The main issue with this orb is that its value is directly related to the item it is being used on.
When being used on a 3 stat rare, or the ability to buy a mirror and copy the .02% of items people would never trade like a 6L 6 stat all good chest.
  
Should you have an amazing item, on an item you would never replace, what is the value of the exalted in relation to this item? The answer is nothing because it adds zero value to the item and deprives you of a currency you could use to trade for a better item in another slot. You would also be highly unlikely to accept anything other than a stupidly and highly overvalued offer of currency for the item *(I can’t speak for anyone here, my 6 stat maximum efficiency boots I would not trade for anything other than a trade the person shouldn’t be doing)*. The point where an exalted adds value to your current item set is the same point at which the currency becomes valueless for you, because you either have so many of them that + or -5 doesn’t matter, or your gear cannot be upgraded in a meaningful way.   
  
**The Way I think about Exalts**  
  
Another way to think about it is that exalting a very good rare to fill the last slot should always complement the least valuable aspect of what you are trying to achieve with your build. For instance a ground slam marauder has gear with life&gt;Resists&gt;Armor&gt;STR\Dex\AttkSpd (depending on slot
  
This means that a rare worthy of exalting already has the first three-four stats and you are looking to be gifted the 5th. I am aware that occasionally you find or create a rare, life leech, 2 resists, and 37 Dex. This means you can exalt life if you value life so much that you cannot live without it on every item. However this item is already worth 2-3 exalteds likely to many people, but if you exalt you have a 1 in ~90 chance on a non hybrid armor to get the max life roll, or in reality 4 in 90 chance (the 4 highest life rolls) to make a perfect type of item. If you exalt you decrease the value of the item, both in trade and in general unless you get life.   
  
So could you trade 23 exalteds for the above described perfect item? Seems very likely
  
**The inflation of certain orbs**  
  
Furthermore you cannot craft exalted orbs. Currently in my inventory despite selling all of my rares for 3 days of /played time

  
Remembering that you can die at any time in hardcore, 4L gloves\boots\helm Ilvl 73 above or better with the objective of sticking with the first maximum efficiency rare you create. This is so you can save currency for a period of time improving all aspects of your gear to the point that you can choose any method you feel is superior to shoot for that Sky Rockets in Flight moment of a perfect 5 or 6 stat rare.
     
This is contingent as always on the trading economy
From this point
  
* 1. Should I use an exalt
* 2. Should I use an exalt on an item that already does everything I need
* 3. Should I accumulate exalteds to trade for a very good item that improves my overall gear in a way more beneficial than 2
* 4. Should I exalt an item that has 5 great stats
  
Further trying to TLDR myself
  
For some more reading about how I think about crafting.  
* http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_large_numbers
* http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gambler%27s_fallacy
  
It is easy enough to create,000 Chaos, exalts etc and you will begin to see the point I am trying to make.

1364693257.0,1bc1t1,The MAPS system critique[Before/After 10.3b],fandabear,77,23,78,"Dear POE community

In the last week and a half I know of 4 friends who ""quit"" the game because of various attitudes towards the maps system.  After reading  similair stories in this subreddit I will try to give a critique of the pros/cons of the maps system

**Before 10.3b (The map drop increase patch; more drops outside of maps and higher lvl maps dropping slightly more often**)

* My experience - My first couple characters were a dual totem witch and a LA ranger(lvl 84/83 respectively), and skill points were coming. After beating Piety on Merciless difficulty, you look around and say, ok wow I guess I can level really fast in docks now til 70-71.  After this I can just hop into maps right? 

* Maps - during that first month me and my small group of friends I had found online ran maps NON STOP.  Those 66 maps with the new tilesets, we hardly ever ran out.  However there were a few issues:

* Map drop rates felt ok in the 66-67 maps we were doing

* When doing maps in a set group of people

I personally never got a 71+ map  in all my time playing on my ranger and witch

(And yes I read Chris's post about chisels and making the maps harder (regalling/alching/chaosing/exalting

**COME 10.3b Patch**

* First of all let me say this patch is awesome.  And the patch before with new map types was awesome too.  I always hear in global chat and from my lower level friends that they feel map drops have been increased SIGNIFICANTLY in zones outside of maps themselves.  This is great for newer players because they no longer have to spend alchemy or farm docks for hours to get a base of maps to use.  

* I went from having about 30-40 lvl 66-67-68 and never getting those 70+ to consistently finding 69's if I rolled my maps 'correctly'.  Also currently have about 25-35 70+ maps saved up.
 I am curently using a full map tab to run redditors through(the 'you get all loot thread') from the past few days.  After finding a build I absolutely LOVE playing(ek shadow), due to redditors finding more 66-68 maps nowadays an donating.  BTW: Having a lvl 75+ map drop feels better than a unique dropping. ^_^

But there are still **issues** regarding variance of map drop rates and investment needed.  

* The friends I mentioned earlier all quit/took a break from the game because even after significant currency and time investments into the maps

* It takes a HUGE currency investment to sustain maps. Something that the average POE player probably wont be able to do for 50 maps in a row.  For example I would estimate I spend 2-3 GCP on each 70+ map.  First I chisel it 4 times, if that makes any sense (I usually get maze for indoor maps in about 3-6 chaos rolls).  Taking into account I have a shop which supplies me a steady stream of income, I was still just barely breaking even.  For many players this is just not possible, and with chisel prices the way they are going, newer players won't be able to get  that little push once their lvling found chisels run out.

* I know RNG is RNG

* For those who think ""You can probably just buy higher lvl maps"", I got MANY whispers the same day about buying the maps. 

-Also please dont get me wrong, and reminiscing on how difficult this mod/map used to be!  I know many people put on the IIQ/IIR and go to town nonstop on 66-67 because they find that to be super fun.  However **I would just like higher lvl players to have more options, while allowing newer players to see a good portion of the game.**

TL;DR - Don't try to roll a 6L.

-----

Many of you have probably seen [this gif](http://i.imgur.com/QjUbr.gif) of someone burning through Fusing Orbs trying to generate a 5L or a 6L, say 25%, it would be difficult to even get a 3L or 4L.

I decided to analyse the rolls from the gif. There are 262 separate fusing rolls (!!!). A quick script to load the image and compare pixel colors at certain locations gave me the the average frequency of links occurring. From the data:

    6S analysis (n=262)
        Link frequency by location:  0.675, 0.568, 0.423
        Overall link frequency: 0.522

Interesting. My first guess as to the method (and which appears to be somewhat accurate), or the previous link was not created), it has a 2/3 chance of being created. However, if it *is* going to connect to an already created link, it only has a 1/3 chance.

For example, in the top right, only has a 1/3 chance of being created. The RNG gods are with us, it also gets created. Now it's a 3L item already. The third and center link is up, again with 1/3 chance... no dice, it is not created. The bottom left is up, but back to a 2/3 chance... success! The final link, is rolled with a 1/3 chance.

To test my hypothesis

    Simulation (n=10
        Link frequency by location: 0.673, 0.502, 0.499
        Overall link frequency: 0.530

As you can see

Furthermore, or about 22%. The chance of getting 4L from a 4S item is (2/3)\*(1/3)\*(1/3) = 2/2, or 7.4%. If anyone has data on these, which either corroborate or refute these data, please let me know.

Happy PoEing.

-----

Edit: More analysis

    When Link0=True
    When Link1=True
    When Link2=True
    When Link3=True

    When Link0=False
    When Link1=False
    When Link2=False
    When Link3=False

Pretty clear trend.

-----

Edit2 OH GOD I CAN'T STOP

It actually looks like the chance decreases progressively with each successful link roll.

Two successive links:

    When Link0=True and Link1=True
    When Link0=False and Link1=True and Link2=True
    When Link1=False and Link2=True and Link3=True

Three successive links:

    When Link0=True and Link1=True and Link2=True
    When Link1=True and Link2=True and Link3=True

So after the first roll at ~66%, to make a 5L, is very low. Zero out of 22 tries from the data.

The first column of the table is a code to be used for reference. This way is easy to search if there's already a comment about any of the nodes. If you find a comment already existing please reply to that comment.

If the community come up with some useful data i will put it all together and post it on the forum for GGG to evaluate.

Some nodes have multiple effects so obviously they would show all the info proposed for the single effects

1365007095.0,1blhbf,"We should talk about ""Curse Etiquette""",ReilyMichaelson,78,23,79,"TL;DR = So when you are in a group of randoms

My solution is whichever is most beneficial to the entire group. I find myself grouping with randoms (yeah I know) where people are cursing and re-cursing so their curse stays. I typically run elemental weakness

1: Group of casters, and some dual ice spear totem guy casts frostbite. Although that helps me being a freeze pulse kind of guy, but the LA Ranger and the pure fire guy aren't doing a whole lot anymore. Plus, isn't this about killing speed anyway? By the time stuff gets frozen on Docks anyway, its dead. Now maybe this would be better on dangerous maps, but I would think enfeeble is instantly a better choice.   

2: In a group, which only leeches on physical, and there's only 1 of him, and 5 casters. I get that maybe solo that would help survivability, but you have 5 other guys aggro-ing mobs. I would also argue that if you are dependant on Life Leech, you'd have the gem equipped and some of it on gear. And if the End. Charges are your thing, I think Enduring Cry is a MUCH better way to go.   

I have had people to tell me to stop casting my curse because theirs is ""better""

Myself and a lot of people have brought to attention the fact that the clusterfuck of spell effects makes group play dangerous and not fun. You can't see anything going on. 

What makes it even worse is the damn summoners and totem users in every group. While there's nothing wrong with the builds themselves

Other people claim not to have this problem and even deny it exists. They typically play the game on low graphic settings. I play with everything maxed and don't believe turning everything down should be mandatory to play in groups.

Solution:

Add in an option to remove party spell effects or severely limit them. Seeing the 20 minions' auras does nothing to enhance our gameplay. As for seeing the other party members' spell effects.. It can be useful to some extent but they could be stripped down to the minimum. As long as I see the guy shooting arrows

It's been a little while since we posted a public progress update

Last week, the long-term future of the project benefits greatly from any additional money we can raise. Our team is currently at 18 people, though we'd love to expand it so that we can generate content at a faster rate.

At the moment, though it's looking like it'll take a few more weeks to receive the produced goods before we can ship them. I'll update with more exact dates once we hear back from our suppliers. It turns out that the logistics of preparing and shipping literally thousands of packages is a bit of an undertaking!

We recently added the top three twitch.tv Path of Exile livestreams to the bottom of the pathofexile.com front page. If you'd like your stream to be featured on this list, Raijin, Kripparrian and Arioc so far. We're also occasionally giving keys to streamers so that they can do giveaways.

One of our priorities over the last few months has been to create and post interesting videos on our YouTube channel. Videos are a really good way of getting new players interested in the game and also allow us to show things to existing players in a very visual way. I've been really enjoying doing the Build of the Week series, I highly recommend it.

As the size of our Beta playerbase has grown, but a few weeks ago we added a one hour cut-throat one as well. This weekend we're offering two cut-throat events (one of them is at a time that hopefully suits European players), and a three-hour hardcore race that disallows partying. Please understand that we run these events on our own weekends, so it's difficult to pick times that are great for everyone. In the future, we intend to further ramp up the number of events that we hold (I'd expect it to hit 4 or 5 per week in the coming weeks, and even more once we enter Open Beta).

We also ran a successful two-week hardcore race a few weeks ago, but there are logistics issues to solve before we can do that.

From a development point of view
Adding PvP
Rebalancing minions and fixing their bugs. Yes
New item hover art!
Arrows are now real projectiles rather than faked long-range melee attacks. This means they can be dodged by running out of the way

We don't yet know when 0.9.12 will be deployed (or put on Alpha). My guess is that it's a few weeks away from being ready. I'll definitely post more information as soon as we know.

In addition to the work on 0.9.12, and keep you guys on your toes with a stream of small changes between major patches. The latest of these patches, 0.9.11k, should be deployed within the next day.

We're aware of several client stability issues that can manifest in the form of either graphical glitches or a crash. We have never seen this happen in our office (despite it happening occasionally within the Beta community), is taking some time to solve.

I'm extremely pleased with how the last few months have gone and am getting very excited about Open Beta. I can't wait for you guys to see Act Three.

http://www.pathofexile.com/forum/view-thread/466089/page/1#p4110078

&gt; ""I do use Lioneye bow""

&gt; This is your problem, versus player evasion.

&gt;Due to Lioneye's Glare granting a stat that gives your attacks 100% chance to hit (""Hits can't be evaded"")

Now that reflect uses your own accuracy and evasion

Here is the accuracy formula:
Chance to Hit = Attacker's Accuracy / ( Attacker's Accuracy + (Defender's Evasion / 4) ^ 0.8 ) 

Plugging in 10, or in other words, 34.3% chance to evade your own reflect damage. With ondar's guile that is 68.7% chance to evade your own reflect damage. 

As can be seen

Due to the way that reflect damage works

 As explained in the [last reflect damage PSA I posted](http://www.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/1hfhdl/psa_kripparian_was_wrong_about_reflect_damage/), enfeebling an enemy will also not reduce damage from reflect.

1365307932.0,1bu4c0,[Suggestion]More Base Jewelry Types,Phaentom,71,17,26,"I've been playing PoE off and on (mostly on) since closed beta but I've never seen any developer mention their design goals in regards to jewelry.

+ **Diamond Ring:** 20% Global Crit Chance

+ **Onyx Ring:** 7-10 All Attribute

+ **Amethyst Ring:** 8-12% Chaos Resistance

+ **Jade Ring:** 120-150 Accuracy

+ **Lapis Ring:** 15-20% Mana regen

+ **Amber Ring:** 8% Increased non-spell damage (not sure if weapon damage applies to everything but spells)

+ **Granite Amulet:**  5% Physical damage reduction (doesn't over-cap)

+ **Mercury Amulet:** 4-8% Increased Movement Speed
  
Obviously with more base types I think it only makes sense to increase the drop rates of jewelry. Opinions welcome

EDIT: I didn't account for the attribute direct bonuses, 20 accuracy, 2% increased evasion, 5 mana, 2% increased energy shield. I would either drop the static health/mana down to 5 or I would remove them completely and increase the attribute range to 8-15.",,False,t5_2sf6m,True

I just now removed the post: http://www.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/1glrmx/moderators_are_actively_censoring_posts_that_are/ Because the comment section was way too heated and also because the title was misleading (despite the irony of me removing that post). More importantly

Firstly, not a single discussion post of the rules has been removed by moderators recently - besides the above mentioned post. We totally encourage discussion of the rules, they were created in co-operation with the users of the subreddit a few months back, after all.

****

Re: removal of image posts

Occasionally, we have had a lot of success with just allowing mod discretion to deal with these posts. Since the rule change there has only been one posted complaint about the results of this process. But, there is definitely evidence that people are concerned about it, shown by the heated comments section in the above-removed post.

Pyrodan, consider posting about this in a reasonable manner without resorting to mod bashing. *We are people too :'(*

**Because of this discourse we will trial moderating image posts explicitly to the rules for a while.** To elaborate

The way images are currently handled:

- memes (upvote bait that ends up pushing away discussion and quality posts)

- image macros (covers things that aren't considered memes but are of the same standard)

- loot drops (some people like them and they can be fun in moderation but last time a discussion was held the majority was against allowing these because they tend to flood the sub)

- funny pics (defined loosely as an image post that is designed with the intention of provoking a chuckle or sharp exhale and an upvote within a few seconds - these are disallowed for the same reason as memes).

- Direct linking of images is not currently cause for post removal - they are only removed if they fall under one of the above categories.

If, a few weeks it can be seen that the image rule isn't covering everything that should be removed we'll call for a re-vote on that rule.

To keep things from going crazy please report posts that you think 100% don't belong here - whether they are covered in the rules or not. We will pay attention to those and if posts get 5-10+reports we'll then remove them. It'll also be nice data for rule development.

Hopefully that covers it, I think we can agree this sub has been pretty awesome. I love checking here 5-100 times a day.

RNG stands for Random Number Generator, and the layout of your instances, among other things.

When we give feedback on a certain element of RNG in the game

1. Should this event be more likely? Less likely?
2. Should this event be RNG at all? 

At first glance

However

1. Get lucky: *get a good outcome from an event*
2. Play more: *get more events*
3. Play smarter: *maximize the gain from good outcomes

While the outcome of a single event is determined entirely by chance

This also means that

**So when someone says ""fusing a 6L should be twice as likely""

So

When evaluating our second question ""should this event be RNG at all?""

1. Getting lucky: *big drops would be less exciting* [:{O](http://i.imgur.com/LIR6QPo.jpg).
2. Playing more: *if we can expect x outcome within y events
3. Playing smarter: *less randomness means less opportunities for min-maxing*

Now to the topic question: being based on the F2P model

The pre-open-beta event had a lot of attention and many of us threw their money at GGG to grab some kiwis before they went extinct (*nice touch, which means a good money donation from true enthusiasts.

Now we're in the open beta and the ""launch event"" is gone and already behind us. I don't have any number so I'm just speculating but... I guess that most of the potential paying customers have spent the money already (now or in the past months). I also think that future newcomers will approach the game as (*another*) good F2P videogame

PoE is not a ""for everyone"" game. It's not easy as other competitors, at least for those who didn't follow PoE in the last months.

Please don't get me wrong: I truly hope GGG will be able to engage the audience and gather more money. They deserve it, now that enthusiasts and beta testers (*aka: most of the fanbase, I suspect*) already spent their money? As said in another post, 18 people require 216 salaries per year.

**Hey Diamond

On the weekend I saw this: [Link](http://pathofexile.gamepedia.com/History_of_Wraeclast)

It is quite an impressive amount of effort put into taking all the snippets of the Path of Exile lore and putting them into a history. I found it especially impressive

The lore of the game is given out piecemeal in small elements like this

The holder of game lore is Erik Olofsson. Erik is one of the founders of Grinding Gear Games and is the Art Director (or Omnitect as he occasionally refers to his role). Edwin McRae, which gets referred to for everything we add into the game. This makes sure the lore is consistent, and over time reveals more of the whole story and history.

**0.11.1e**

The most recent patch included four unique items. This set of items included several powerful

There has been some criticism over the power level of these items. This is something we take seriously

This may mean upcoming items get additional scrutiny. We don’t want items that would prevent players wanting to aim for a better rare for an item slot. We don’t want items with many complicated special mods

**The next patch**

The 0.11.2 patch will probably be deployed early next week with some new unique items.

We have three unique items likely to go in. Two are looking like build enablers

**Insider Info**

This weeks insider info includes an excerpt from our lore:

Archbishop Geofri of Phrecia Cathedral (Fellshrine Ruins)

Templar and theologian, not a stone’s throw from Geofri’s Phrecia Cathedral (now the Fellshrine ruins). It was Geofri who coined the title, “Chamber of Sins” for Maligaro’s lab.

4) When should i start to use Orb of Chance or Orb of Alchemy ? What itemlevel should the item be?

5) How can i find out what item i can get lets say from a Glourious Plate ( i know they roll Kaoms Heart) if i roll it? Because if i know what it rolls than i would obviously only roll items i need

* 1.“Humble beginnings” – You are new to the game and decide to start with some class. You will suck. This first char will be your entrance to the game and is going to suffer for that. I don’t recommend starting on Hardcore right away because you will need to make mistakes and learn from them.  Just accept it – you will always remember this character fondly but he’s not going to get you to the top.

* 2.“Fun times” – You’ve learned a good deal already and also with many alts found the style of play that is the most comfortable to you. You start reading guides and tweaking your performance. You understand the game and it speaks to you.

* 3.“The gauntlet “ – now it’s all about effectiveness, game economy now makes more sense than real world economy. You are a force in PvE and PvP. Your stash is heavy with the best loot and yet there is some craving…

* 4.“The folly” – your knowledge and gear is so powerful you can’t hit anyone because all mobs and bosses run away from you.  That’s when you decide to switch to Hardcore completely. You have some loot from previous attempts but it’s beggar scraps compared to your SC stash. If you are lucky you are able to trade your SC for HC stuff with 90% loss of value and that will be great. HC will drive you mad and question your own sanity as one tiny mistake will end the life of your most successful character and you will love it.

* 5.“The enlightenment” – you’ve seen it all, no map uncleared and no challenge unconquered. That’s when you crave the most unique experience – esoteric builds that would not survive in the hands of lesser men, your heavy-armored dual-wielding witch that sacrificed all her mana, your barbarian who doesn’t have a single use for his weapons except for spell improvement, your ranger that looks in the eyes of your enemies as he smashes the biggest two-handed maul into their skulls and yells with rage. And as the last hardcore boss of the highest difficulty falls below the character who shouldn’t even be alive after the first act, then you know – you’ve beaten the game.

&gt;EDIT: A few notes before we begin:
&gt;Obviously
&gt;WED = Increased Elemental Damage with Weapons. For the below notes
&gt;FED = Adds +Flat # Elemental Damage
&gt;IPD = Increased Phys Damage
&gt;Items with conflicting ele / phys damage

&gt;Also
====


* Wands:
-Phys builds: high +flat phys AND +% phys (i.e., ias +Crit chance/multiplier. -Elemental builds: triple fire, ice, lightning flat dmg rolls with 30+ midpoint dps of each, crit chance/mult is good here too. -Spell builds:70+% total spell damage increase, &gt;100% preferable, plus 40+% spell crit chance

* Bows:
Thicket Bows and Imperial bows are good endgame
-Phys builds: high +flat phys AND +% phys (i.e., +7-15% ias.
-Elemental builds: triple fire, +7-15% ias. (Can triple +FED and +WED both roll on a bow? I haven't seen this, but it would be insane if so.)

* Melee Weapons: The same phys/elemental breakdowns as the above

* Daggers: ""It seems Physical Daggers with 100% inc Phys and a flat phys roll + increased Crit Chance makes for a really high price
I haven't really seen any spellcrit daggers other than Divinarius, it's just rare to get one good enough for this to happen. It needs to have the 80% base, a ~90%+ crit roll, and a large amount of spell damage/% elemental damage (like 60%+). Bonus points for decent crit multi. These are practically non-existent, but they can be very effective if the build using it already has lots of cast speed from other sources and just wants more crit chance."" --Jihok

* Chests: A combination of +200-300 flat defense and +90+% increased defense

* Boots: Same as chest but need 20+% ms

* Gloves: Same as chest but +2% mana leech is good

* Hat: Same as chest

* Belt: Lots of either ES or Life

* Shield: Defense

* Quiver: Life, Flat Ele dmg, IPD, IAS.

* Rings: Varies widely but high resistance rolls and +life/+es are never wrong. High +flat ele dmg and Rarity &amp; Quantity rolls are good. +IPD Good for facebreaker/phys builds.

* Amulets:  +lots to all attributes, Rarity &amp; Quantity, +life/es, +global crit chance.+IPD Good for facebreaker/phys builds. +Life Leech good for some melee builds. +flat or %Armor/Eva good at high rolls too. ""cast speed, crit multiplier, % ES, resists (especially high +all res rolls), spell damage."" --Jihok

The only melee build that seems to be somewhat viable is CI claw but even then its output is inferior to ranged and that's a really expensive late game build. No Kaoms no melee I guess.

**Wiki Wednesday!** - http://en.pathofexilewiki.com

What's that, quickly updated information is key to the success of an online game like Path of Exile. So I thought, why not have a weekly event where we remind everyone to read and contribute to the wiki. Additionally, we can pick out a specific article or area of the wiki that needs some love and try to improve it.

This week, people are going to be looking to the Quest Rewards page to figure out what combination of Class and Quest will allow them to quickly pick up the gems they want or need. It's going to take a significant amount of effort to keep this page up-to-date.

How can you help? As you level up a character, please do log into the wiki and edit in the correct information. It's easy to make an account and edit stuff yourself. If you're *really* scared about editing a wiki or screwing something up, then you could at least post in this thread or in a new Reddit thread to let someone else know what needs to be changed or cleaned up.

I'd love to hear the community's thoughts on this event and the current state of the wiki. Recommendations for particular wiki pages/sections to focus on improving in the future would be great

Every patch that buffs melees so far is mostly just buffing our damage output

Take the cyclone release for example 

But this whole skill is countered by lightning thorns 

Also , being a cleaver. Ok my damage went up a lot , but this only makes reflect hit for more, and my life on hit is reduced.

After playing a ranger dual wielder myself since open beta release, it's having to facetank all the mobs.

Possible solution : Add a few damage reduction points to melee physical nodes. Any other place would again benefit the ranged characters.

Another solution : change the 20% max health lifesteal cap to 30% 

Does anyone else have some solutions?

As of [S1E15](http://www.pathofexile.com/forum/view-thread/205303) they have introduced a lower level tier for 1 RP. This means us less skilled

1 RP isn't an entitlement nor does it break the racing system. It should encourage people to give races a shot thus eventually improve their skills enough to break into the next minimum level tiers.

1373478443.0,1i0rn2,Map drops should always go to the maker.,EaterOfSound,108,57,109,"When in a map group

I do not understand the reasoning behind the game giving away maps to the group because they happened to roll blue.

Chris Wilson please!

Edit: To those who do not run their own maps for public groups: Imagine you  are providing charity in this manner and a 72 maps drops blue and some guy takes it. Now imagine this happening on a frequent basis. If these people want higher level maps they should build their own pool and get there. They dont deserve to get free lvl 72+ maps for nothing.

Edit again: I don't care if i'm running a level 71 map and some guy gets a blue 66-67 map. By all means keep it. The problem is when equal level and higher level maps get taken. This prevents the group leader from sustaining the map pool that he has earned. If GGG wants people to be able to get maps by running other people's maps,False,self,t5_2sf6m,1373500957.0,,,t3_1i0rn2

Selling unidentified blue/rares will net you Orbs of Transmutation.

Selling items with 3-linked Blue

Check out http://en.pathofexilewiki.com/wiki/Vendor_Recipes to find recipes to get Alchemy Shard/Orbs.

The easiest way (although it gets expensive) to get Alchemy Shards is to pick up flasks and use Transmutation Orbs and Alteration Orbs to make them ""Surgeon's""
