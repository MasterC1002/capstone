What you saw was a heavily pregnant lady holding a leash to seemingly the world's best behaved Labrador mix

The reality was. We came to the dog park to escape the chaos at home. I can't sleep lately because I'm a whale about to pop. Add a dash of hormones. The toddler child threw at least five screaming fits that morning which somehow involved a food explosion (hence the ponytail). The dog got overly excited so I let her out... But the neighborhood cat was visiting so she went nuts barking and chasing it getting her paws all muddy before rushing into the house and jumping all over my couch. Did I mention my son was having a toddler day? Screaming, tears, snot, spit, poop... everywhere all because his cheerios were on the floor... where he threw them. Also, I should mention that all this occurred before 8:00AM (my neighbors love me).

So. I found my happy place. Grabbed a granola bar. Cleaned the dog. Picked up my son still kicking and screaming and loaded the entire uncivilized bunch into the car. Somehow in the 10 minute hell-ride to the dog park,False,,t5_2s3i3,False,,,t3_1af8za

During my pregnancy I became reluctantly attached to my growing bump and the little movements inside of myself. I knew, loved her, before she was here, but I also was terrified of becoming one of those Mother's I used to pity. 
My mind was set that children were a handful I never wanted even after she was born. It didn't change through the hardships of having surgery to birth her, 8 months later). I felt myself a horrible Mother, though I met her every need and loved her I still didn't feel in my heart I wanted children. Then, in one split second, as she turned 8 weeks old, I had an epiphany and it was born on the corners of her first smile. 
Everything I had ever felt about children or their parents before had disappeared
Now I understand why those sleepless nights are worth it, smiles and seeing her grow has given me the greatest gift of all - a life to protect, to love and to comfort.

Our doctor is so wonderful, remembers everything.  Anyway, we were just talking and reflecting when the nurse came in to give my daughter her booster shots.

That's when it all came flooding back to me.  I remembered the first time I met my pediatrician was in the hospital room, pulls up her arms, pokes her belly... I remember my husband and I just watching in frozen horror at this woman manhandling our baby!!  But then the doctor sat down and simply talked to us, answering all our questions, offering reassurance--she is wonderful.

And I remembered my baby getting her first shots and how I felt like such a horrible person to betray that little thing by having her poked with needles.  Even though

And then I remembered the time when she was two and got her shots and she was so mad she threw the sucker back into the nurse's face.

Just all of these moments came back as my big girl sat on the examination table telling the doctor about her college plans and her hopes for the future. 

I know everyone says it, exactly, I think it was awe at the whole experience.

I'm so excited for my daughter's future

So, enjoy every age with the joys and challenges that come with each one.  It's a marvelous gift we've been given to be able to nurture these little souls.

It was unexpected and quite a surprise since I had the IUD that was supposed to be good for 10 years. I had it for 8 years. After discussing with my fiance we agreed and decided to remove the IUD knowing we had a 50% chance of having a miscarriage within 7 days after having it removed. It wasn't an easy decision but after our research
Following the 7 days after having the IUD removed were very stressful and nerve wrecking but worth it. At the end
Well after multiple ultrasounds due to having the IUD my doc noticed an abnormality. I was sent to a specialist who confirmed that I had an ovarian mass the size of a softball. My mouth dropped in disbelief! I had just gone through getting the IUD successful removed and now an ovarian mass!! Next, during my entire pregnancy I dealt with the worst morning sickness both day and night. That alone was terrible and I was miserable. Finally, the day arrived for surgery. Long story short everything went well and we were all very thankful.
So after surgery had to have bed rest and recover. I continued to have terrible morning sickness and no matter what I would take it wouldn't help. 
Time went by and at 32 weeks found myself in the hospital because my water broke. I was an emotional rollercoaster, but was trilled and happy that I was going home.
After going through so much during my entire pregnancy

Everyone asks, people would suggest sleep training/cry-it-out but I knew sleep training would not work for my child.  I felt that she needed me, for one reason or another, and I needed to be there for her.  I was constantly unsure about our breastfeeding relationship (misplaced fears, of course) and knew that if she was waking up wanting to nurse, she must need to eat.  Cosleeping made this so much easier.  We tried just about everything, but she just wouldn't sleep when laid down on her own.  Miracle blankets, vibration

Soon after her first birthday, she would comfort nurse for hours.  Unlatching caused hysterics until we started the whole cycle over again.  I was finally able to admit I was exhausted.  That was when I found [Dr. Jay Gordon's technique](http://drjaygordon.com/attachment/sleeppattern.html) on night weaning while cosleeping.  I wasn't very hopeful that my velcro baby would be receptive to this new, big change.  It worked.  It worked so freaking well.  Within a week she wasn't waking up anymore.  If she did, she would wimper, roll over, and be back to sleep.  This was a revolutionary change to the way our nights went for the previous year.  We knew the next step was transitioning out of our bed.

At 15 months, she woke up a few times a night and I would go lay with her (no nursing), hum, pat, and soothe her back to sleep.  One month later, she was sleeping straight through until 6am.  Then, I would bring her to my bed, and wake up at 7:30 for the day. 

Yesterday, put her in bed and guess what?  She slept in her own room, all night.  She woke up one time because she flopped out of the bed and landed on the very soft, carpeted floor. I went in, put her back in, and she was asleep.  Our typical nursing time rolled around, she woke up and we carried on like normal.  Tonight

I feel like the transition was slow and steady enough for her to be secure in each step before moving on to the next.  I don't regret cosleeping one bit.  I did what I had to do at the time to get rest and have a happy baby. Now,,False,,t5_2s3i3,False,,True

My perfect 1 year old little girl has been to hospitals, especially when they had to give her enough propofol to knock out an elephant.  

I couldn't pick up my babies for about a week because of my back and neck injuries. Could you even imagine not being able to hold your babies because of physical pain caused by someone's stupidity? My husband lost so many work hours

My daughter's eyes will never be the same from the trauma of taking the brunt of the impact. (her car hit my daughters door) The eye specialist said she will have to do vision therapy, and very expensive to the grand total of $635 for 2 pairs. 

This is just a rant as sometimes I wanna break down and cry still, please....always pay attention while driving. Yes, no serious injuries happened, but it is heart wrenching to know my baby may need surgery to fix her eyes down the road.  She used to be so outgoing before the accident, now she refuses to potty train, (before she was going on the potty) her talking is very minimal, (about 10 words for a 25 month old) and she is afraid to go to new places. Any dr appointment is a break down.  

I just wanted to say that because of something as ridiculous as picking up a phone while driving

Please pay attention to the road while driving. Everything else can wait......really.

He is the source of so much joy, but took our time growing up and maturing until we were exactly where we wanted to be in order to give our future children everything that we wanted them to have.  I regret nothing about the path we have chosen... except that I regret everything.  The time we took to become who we are now was crucial.  This is exactly the way my life was always supposed to be.  My husband is my best friend

My mom passed away two weeks ago.  She was 61 years old and died of melanoma.  Ten years ago she had melanoma skin cancer removed.  Three years ago she had part of her lung removed due to a melanoma tumor.  At that time she and my dad realized what was coming.  Last August the melanoma showed back up as tumors in her abdomen.  She tried several grueling and tortuous treatments, cheered me on as I ran until 8 months and weight lifted until after my due date, and supported me in every way a daughter could ask her mother to support her pregnancy.  She was just out of the hospital in between treatments when she came to my baby shower which she helped plan.

My son was born on January 1 and my parents came to the hospital in tuxedos with champagne!  According to my dad

While I was home on maternity leave, and giggled.  I knew she was sick, but I didn't realize how serious the situation was at the time.  She was so calm and resolved that it just never occurred to me that we were running out of time.  Wesley was 3 1/2 months old when she passed.  They didn't get a lot of time together but they had quality time.  She took us to his first pediatrician's appointment, he had his first belly laugh in her lap, and he smiled that big silly baby smile whenever he saw her.

Two weeks ago we went to Florida for a family vacation, Wesley was the shining light that kept us going.  He would laugh and play and we spent all of our time cuddling him.

I started this post by saying that I don't regret the path my life has taken

We have been together about 5 years

We discussed and decided I would stay home with the baby. The numbers worked. But my husband never added me onto his bank account. OK

It turns out my husband has been lying to me about how much money he makes (WTF?). I came to discover this after a lengthy argument/discussion about our finances. (The reason: He seemed to run out of money really fast and my one credit card which he agreed to pay was past due. I have never been late on payments.) He says he lied because thought I would think less of him. 

I said we had issues about financial transparency and that I needed to be added onto his bank account. He said he would NOT add me. At this point I'm thinking oh god I've screwed myself

There is other stuff. I gave my husband $500 in cash in the first few weeks after we had the baby to send a payment to the hospital and he never made it. I should have sent it myself but I had cash and I was so tired back then

He asks his mother for money without discussing it with me. She is a wealthy old lady and it may not be a big deal to her but it matters to me. I told him I disagreed with him asking her for money because there should be no need - in theory

Today, if you don't split any money with me I am assuming there is none to divide."" He says I'm overreacting and that ""it's our money"" but I have no access to it! I have no way of knowing what he actually has there. I dont want to ask my husband for $20 here and there. That is not a marriage. 

I have $25 in my bank account right now. I feel so low. I used to be independent. I'm so stupid for not having set up our finances before getting married. I may have not left my job foolishly thinking my husband would take of us. I may have never decided to have a baby with this man in the first place.

Asking all the questions that would have been answered if he had come and stayed for a few days. His first question was ""which side of the diaper is the front?"" He apologized profusely and told me ""he had no idea what it entailed"" and ""I had no idea you have been doing all of this alone"" He had me pick him up immediately in the am (8am) instead of the evening. He said he would be open to coming up and learning his routine now and that he is sorry he didn't trust me. He said he was ""so determined to prove that he could do it but he ended up proving he couldn't""

Him and I had a long talk when I picked him up. We are going to go to counseling together to work out our parenting issues- as someone in the original post suggested.

I also wanted to point out something to everyone who reemed me out in my original post:

I never kept my son from him nor do I want to. I wanted to keep my son SAFE. The fact that he had to call 8 times in 12 hours screams that he was ill prepared. He WILL be getting him his next scheduled visit and he has agreed to come up and learn how to care for him before that visit (as he should have before this one). I absolutely do not feel bad about wanting him to stay home when he was sick and the fact that his dad had no idea how to care for him. I know for sure I am in the right. You need to check yourself if you think I am a bad parent for being concerned about my son's well being. Why aren't I one of those mothers who doesn't give a shit and drops her kid off for the weekend whenever she can?

I guess that's normal for mothers in this situation - I mean, he wouldn't tell me. He wouldn't make a peep to save his own life. I had to set my alarm clocks to go off every three hours

I spent the last year and a half trying to convince the people around me, after screaming at them a lot - people started to look at me and say ""Why are you trying to hard to prove that there's something wrong with your child?"" - like my demanding his testing would be the last nail in his coffin, or something. No one understands that I am just trying to do what I feel is right by my child. Still, can't they tell that it's eating me up inside?

I was a very advanced child - intellectually. By my sons age, and even than he never plays with them... he lines them up categorized by shape, color and the size of the wheels. Every wonderful childhood memory I have, that I had hoped to share with my child - has been dashed. He and I will never pretend to be pirates searching for buried gold in the back yard. He will never much care for bedtime stories such as Harry Potter or The Hobbit. We won't play dress-up. He's a year behind developmentally; he may never even reach average intelligence (by it's general definition).

Of course I am sad. Of course I don't WANT this for my child. Who would? No one would choose this. Everything that brings me joy in life - he can't relate to. My son will never relate to me, for the little boy who wont eat 90% of the food in existence. Every day it's a challenge to find out if he'll eat or choose to starve. Than the cleaning, fighting against a child with OCD-like tendencies who must have the house a certain way, cars lines up in corners and toys in piles that can't be moved or cleaned because than a tantrum is surely coming. Never going out into the world because he hates play dates, he hates family gatherings, he hates fairs and festivals and fun family events - not just hate, no - but he shuts off. The smallest bit of sensory overload and he stops blinking, stops moving - he dead weights himself. Like he's gone comatose. So, he'll like it once he's here"". Because they don't understand

None of this is easy. Pretending like everything is okay and being the super-mom, ever. He doesn't want to show me affection, I don't even know if he cares for me, locked away up there in his head like he is. It's hard knowing that all the things I imagined us bonding over are impossible. It's hard watching him get so frustrated and angry because he want's to talk to me - he wants to communicate his needs and feelings - but he literally can not; he gets mad and he pinches me and I have to send him for a time-out when it's not really his fault. He's just reacting to the situation his disability has put him in. It's hard. It's all so hard.

Still, feelings and needs to the world. I am not allowed to be weak. I am not allowed to be sad. Hell, I am barely allowed to sleep anymore - but god am I tired. And I know, I know I just ranted and raved for paragraphs upon paragraphs and that I didn't pose a question that anyone out there in mommit could truly answer for me - but I needed to do it. I needed to finally tell someone that I am not okay. I needed to be weak, for a moment, because as soon as I am done typing this I have to get right back on the phone and start fighting again... and I'll be fighting from now until the conceivable future - as a mother, what else is there to do?

Edit: Thank You to everyone, and I will be speaking openly and honestly to the few family members who have (up to this point) been acting in an accusatory and unhelpful manor. Hopefully once my son and I have started the early intervention work, I can come back to you with an update on how we are both doing - with good news. Thank you, again - for the support, it's more than I could have thought to ask for. 

**Edit Two**: Wow, we are going to make personalized social stories to help him with day to day social living stuff, we are saving up for an ipad and looking into all the different apps available for him. We are going to start concentrating on the things he does like; science, machinery, cars, trains, animals - and stop trying to push the things he dislikes. Encourage who he is; and make no attempts to define who he should be - he'll make that definition himself, and I will be educating my family and friends that had previously been acting in a way that was detrimental to my son's development. I am really looking forward to finally having a plan - and making some progress. I can't wait to communicate with my son; it'll make these last two and a half years of hard work,,green

I can't tell you how proud I am of them. Hard workers

I could say something about how proud I am about them in school

I am proud of the men that they are. I am proud that they follow through. I am proud that despite the practice that they had as children with lying, unlike many of their peers. I am proud that they are mentally stable and respect the boundaries of others. I am proud that they take the risks and live their lives without a net. That they love dogs and cats and children. 

I am proud that somehow, on my own as a divorced mom. Somehow, some way, I managed to not fuck them up. I have no idea how that happened.

So when days get discouraging with your young ones and you feel like you are squeezed out and frustrated

Eventually your children will grow up and become productive adults that will mirror every instant of the hard work and love that you put into them. You will see your kid pick up someone's baby and give it a loving hug. You will see them lean over and be kind to a pet. You will see them walk for their graduation. You will be in awe of the process of change and growth as they morph from wide eyed innocence into adults that you will impress you.

Well, baby? Do you remember 8:12am last year? You were so small, but so strong. I was so happy. Do you remember how you screamed like I was torturing you when you took your first bath? Do you remember when you were 2 weeks old and I thought you had a skin disease, and Papaw explained to me that it was just diaper rash? Do you remember having to have the hair dryer going while I rocked you just to get you to sleep? Do you remember when you were a month old and no longer wanted to sleep in my bed? Do you remember when you were 2 months old and I tried to convince everyone that you were definitely saying ""mama"" when you cried? They called me crazy, but I know you were. And that night your first swing stopped swinging and Mommy had to panic all night trying to figure out how to get you to sleep? You fell asleep snuggling eeyore in your pooh bear bouncer. I cried for 15 minutes from sheer relief. Do you remember Halloween when I was trying to get you to sleep, but those asshole children were beating on the windows demanding candy? I almost kicked a child that night, baby. Do you remember Thanksgiving when Mommy tried to make dinner for everyone by herself? It turned out awesome, and doesn't pay attention to any of it? Do you remember when we moved out of the apartment? You were so mad that we were taking all of your things out of the house. I put your swing in my room for the first few weeks in the new house because I couldn't imagine not having you right next to me. Do you remember when you sat up on your own for the first time? I took a picture then pushed you down. I wasn't going to tolerate you growing up. Do you remember your first bites of food? Uncle Brad said it looked like poop and by the look on your face after that first bite, I cried. Do you remember Papaw teaching you how to drink out of a bottle? Do you remember having your first bad fever? for a week? My fear? Do you remember the drive back home? Stopping at that hotel and me letting you crawl around the filthy floor with reckless abandon because it made you so happy? Do you remember going swimming for the first time? It was so cold. Do you remember when you found that pokemon card and just HAD to show me, and I can't promise that I won't be sad every single year on this day. Every day you get more independent

I rationalized this choice because I thought that it was a better choice for my child. Daycares where we have lived - a lot of different places - have consistently been either *way* too expensive ($1600 a month for 3 days a week!) or of such poor quality that it scared me - mothers would complain about their children being underfed or not fed at all, I'll stay home and make sure I'm the best mom I can be to my angel. 

But my son is a nightmare. He bites, punches. He swears. He tells me he hates me. He *will not* sit still, even to eat, unless he is actively engaged in pooping. He refuses to use the potty - to the point where he'll hold it so long it requires medical intervention. Television helps but he still only sits still for five or ten minutes before he's up and running again. He's three years old. 

He starts preschool in the fall and I'm terrified of what the teacher will think. He screams for no reason. He shrieks, I've followed the methods, I've tried adjusting every aspect of our routine to help him. I hate those mothers who say that their toddlers have ADHD but I seriously think he might. Sometimes when he talks about something he gets excited and his arms and legs flail and twitch like he can barely hold them still. 

Last night as we were getting out of the tub

I can't handle this anymore. I don't know what I'm doing wrong. I feel like the worst mother in the world and I have nowhere else to go.

I have no life outside of fighting with my child to nap and cleaning up the food he throws across the room. And now we're going to have another one?  What the fuck was I thinking????  I have zero excitement about this coming child. I'm mainly excited to not be pregnant anymore. I find myself wishing more and more that I'll just die in childbirth. Not really looking for advice or anything

I do have a long ugly history of depression and I have been seeking out treatment. The earliest appointment I could get was a month from now. I even went to the emergency psych ward this morning and what I got was... A referral to call the place where I can't get an appointment for a month. The OB who oversees the midwife practice I go to isn't comfortable writing me a prescription for antidepressants.

I have a bad genetic health condition that makes me quite frail, then my mom came up for a week, and then his mom, who's retired, came up for over a month, all to help with my son, and give me time to recover.

That was... difficult, even if he's sweating, freaking out if he so much as touches a power cord. Drove me nuts, but I trusted her.

And...

I've been giving my son this liquid yogurt stuff in a sippy cup for some time now. But, cleaned immediately after use, 1 sippy cup for juice, a little less stringently cleaned, and the rest were water only. If the juice or yogurt sippy cups couldn't be found, he just didn't get any.

When my back went out, mom, MIL), about the yogurt, about how hard the sippy cups are to clean, and how important it is to take the valve out *every time* in order to clean them. They all agreed like I was talking about the obvious, so I was satisfied.

I've not been able to clean the cups in 3 months. His mom's gone

So late last night:

I got up to soothe the little man during his nightly crying bouts, and swap out.

As was my usual practice from those months ago

Black mold. OMG. Next one.

The same. Forgive my yelling, afraid of what I'd see, but hoping at least it was okay. Nope, it had a huge chunk of black in it! That one was so thick, it was a colony a full cm across!

I almost broke down crying. My husband likes to ""Demonstrate"" to my son how to drink from the sippy cup

I spent the next two hours, trying to get rid of the black mold. I got one - just *one*, of seven of them - satisfactorily cleaned, but the rest, 2 hours of intensive work couldn't get rid of the black stuff. The valves are too small to clean out with a brush/sponse, it's soaking/treatment + rinsing only. Though I resorted to chopsticks...

His stupid, practically abusive, she's so obsessive and pushy, mom... she freaking blew me off! She ignored my system, and failed to clean the sippy cups, despite my initial warning, and later protests (for instance, to prevent food wastage

I'm thinking of dumping all the damned sippy cups and replacing them entirely. I don't know if I can trust them

I know you guys will know my pain. Just thought I'd share. I'm glad his mom's not staying with us right now

**TL;DR** My MIL ignored my warnings about how critically important it is to clean the sippy cups before they get hard to clean

Edit: For note, fail to closely examine the nozzles and valves, he did resume the system, and did resume cleaning out the sippy cups after every use. If they hadn't already been thick with mold, so thick that a soak and rinse apparently does nothing, there would be no problem.

**Edit**: The original post also added my mother in the blame. But I really have no reason to believe she was responsible at all - she left as soon as my MIL arrived,,False,,t5_2s3i3,1363285447.0,,True

I asked hubby to snuggle him and he got frustrated and said ""I have to be up in an hour!"" I said ""I have to be up in 2 hours and you've slept all night, leaving baby with him. Baby kept fussing and hubby snapped again that he needed to feed. I didn't think so but I nursed him a bit anyways and gave him back. he kept fussing. Hubby asked if I gave him both sides, I said no, he's not hungry. Baby kept fussing, hubby AGAIN snaps ""Why is he doing this""? I said he's been doing it all night, he just needs to be held and maybe rocked. ""Did you ever think that's maybe because he's HUNGRY?!?!?!""

Tonight my 23 year old (who still lives with me because my house is huge and I would get lonely)

Then he says he is meeting a friend at a local market

Corned beef from scratch takes a week, asking what I need, then he gets irritated and won't answer the phone when I call him back. 

He comes home from the market with $30 worth of USDA choice brisket

So, mince 3 cloves of garlic, and throw that in the pressure cooker with water and a package of Lipton Onion Soup mix. I cut up some potatoes for mash and set them on the stove with some water. I can hear the pressure cooker down there making its hissing noises right now. He is not going to get any food until about 10 PM, because he came back at 7:45. 

I am not complaining! 

Because as someone that is on the other end of where you all with babies are... I love the holy living hell out of my kids. I see what all the hard work has produced. I see the kids that work hard, that I watched take their first steps, learn new things every day, the kids that I taught to read and  forced to practice their instruments. And I finally see what all that hard work is for. 

I have seen them pull away gradually on their way to adulthood and it was painful at times

But sometimes, but when they want me. 

Being a parent is a 24/7, *that* you have it. 

So the next time you are walking the floor with a colicky baby

It's over in an instant, every t-shirt you washed will become part of them, and they will still look to you for support and comfort. You won't be forgotten. So do your best, every day!

I truly believe I'm being discriminated against!,jennielouu,61,10,20,"I've been on maternity leave for almost 4 of the 6 weeks I am taking off and was invited in to attend a little lunch party with my office, and overseeing expenses. On top of all that I took care of all the odd jobs
They gave me a list of reasons for my demotion which included:


My write up. I was written up for having an employee start training before I cleared it with HR. This expecation was implemented earlier that week and was specifically in place to ensure we had new employee's drug test results and background checks completed before we hired them. (You'd think they would have had this in place in the beginning especially considering we were a pharmacy but no.) My HR lady and I were corresponding the entire day because she was sure that the results would be in that day and I had told her I was planning on training him that evening due to another employee quitting without notice. I trained him that evening with my fingers crossed hopping the results were in but they were not. That was a serious mistake on my part obviously.


It was my job to bring down our Courier expenses. I was to do this by sending drivers to make deliveries if they were in range without exception and implement another driver to make some long distance deliveries to some cities that were 1-3 hours away. We get a very good deal on those deliveries with our courier service as they charge only $12-$30 per delivery depending on distance. However, who as usual did not respond for another week or so. Weeks after this, my HR lady contacted me and told me she wanted to go ahead with hiring another driver who would be based in one of those cities. I set about immediatly advertising a position and interviewing prospective employees. By this time my leave was coming up in a matter of days so in an effort to leave as little mess for the person who would be temporarily taking over my position I called my HR lady and asked her (since I've never hired anyone in a different town than our busness was in) where I should send the prosectives to take their drug tests, how I should go about getting their employee packets set up, if I should send another employee down there to train them or have them come to us, ect. She responed by telling me she was leaving on vacation and that I should direct those questions to my boss. He never responded.


While I was on leave
Payroll. I was visited by my boss in April to discuss new procedures (among other things). One of these were changes on how payroll was to be done. The way we reimburse our drivers for gas and use of their personal vehicles is a $2 tax free reimbursement per delivery made. These can add up very quickly depending on the area you are delivering to and the amount of deliveries made. For my boss's home branch a flat reimbursement of $2 per delivery works well enough. The drivers have lots of deliverys and easily make back at least what they spend on gas. My branch is a lot slower, and not the entire route. My boss was in support of this and we created a map of how this would work. While I was on leave I was instructed to have my pharmacist take over driver payroll. I trained her as best as I could but we both knew there would be time constraints on her that would make things difficult but there were no other options. Since then it is in my understanding payroll got messed up big time during my leave creating a huge mess for our main payroll lady. My boss who I created the reimbursement system with says he now did not ok this but I have a map with his handwritting with the exact same information as mine on it as evidence that he indeed worked on this system with me.


After making my case and pointing out the discrepancies with their reasons they said they still wanted to stick with their decision of demoting me in order to find someone who could be more receptive of their communication. That one write up was the only indication I've ever had that they were not pleased with my performance. The only feedback I've ever had on my performance was given by my boss during his only visit and that was to point out that I was going above and beyond his expectations and was pleased with how quickly 
I was learning Excel.

The birth was not straightforward and baby had to stay for one week in NICU. Now she's home, and if I was back in my country of origin I'd take her to see a doctor straight away.

However:

1. Her parents are living with us and both she and they believe in ""doing the month"" (坐月子) - the traditional Chinese practice where you don't leave the house for a month after giving birth. She can't go out to see friends (or doctors)

2. Neither she nor they believe that Chinese people can suffer from PPD. They think it's a Western import. In China, they wouldn't let on, and she wouldn't want to raise the subject with them.

3. I highly doubt that the public healthcare system is equipped to deal with this. I've seen a lot of doctors in my time in China

Are there are women here of Chinese extraction who've been through PPD? How did they make their families understand? Are there resources online in Chinese for PPD

1364302468.0,1b1e84,[rant] I am livid. ,Q-Kat,70,16,23,"Hi there

You youngest

my elder one used to go and I never had any problems then but it was completely different staff as he went when both the current staff were on maternity leave. 

A few weeks ago a child escaped the playroom and was found in the corridor crying by a lady at the toddler group across the hallway. The staff didn't know he was missing until he was taken back in. Now this alone is a terrible incident but mistakes can be made

A week after a mum came in to pick up her little girl and found her outside in the carpark. She no longer attends and this incident was the first one anyone heard about although the staff never informed anyone. Two days later 3 boys were running around in the carpark and a granny had to come get the staff. [this last  bit is highly relevant]

last week it happened again with another boy slipping past into the corridor. Today there was an parent meeting about the situation.

Now, meanwhile it's everythings fault except the staff. 

I go about the next few hours filling in the complaints form I go to pick up my little one

they just sat for over an hour in that meeting fucking telling me the parents involved were told and here I am

I am out of my mind with rage right now. I can't even.. 

I have to pull him out because it's not on! they didn't report the incident to me

but if I pull him out I have nowhere else to take him for socialising and he really needs it he's so clingy. I need the couple of hours in the morning to spend one on one with my older boy. the only ppl suffering from this are us several times over and they'll just take a new parent off the waiting list who knows nothing about their dangerous negligence.

The new landlord called saying there was a mattress and a little bit of garbage left there

When we looked at this place people were still living there and it was kinda messy but the landlord assured us that the house would be cleaned, and repairs done. We really needed a place with that much space so we signed a lease with him, trusting that it would look much better cleaned up. 

He told us the house was open tonight and we could start moving stuff in. We still decided that we wouldn't move anything until tomorrow but we wanted to show SO's mom and sister the new place so we went by. 

We pull into the driveway and there is garbage piled up against the house past the first floor windows. We go in and the house reaks of feces, garbage, dirt, and random items all over the floor. The stove was pulled away from the wall and the floor underneath was full of grease, dirt, and small toys(previous tenants had a child). They left tooth brushes, pill bottles, the toilet was backed up. 

Only the living and dining room were repainted, with huge areas of paint missing looking like it bubbled and chipped off. The floors were once again disgusting carpet covering linoleum that was pulling up off of rotting wood. All of the closet doors were broken or missing. And less than half of the lighting fixtures worked(we checked the bulbs and they were fine), all rooms had ceiling fans that were broken. 
So I called the landlord saying it was unacceptable. He just said he could take another 50 off of the rent for us having to clean

Then my SO opened the basement door and a cat ran out! The landlord claimed that non of his previous tenants had animals when we signed the lease because I asked because our daughter has very bad pet dander allergies. While on the phone with him tonight he claimed that his son ran the cat out of the house because it was left behind(great guys). The cat would coming running if we went anywhere near the kitchen cupboards

After the landlord trying to reason with us that it's not that bad, he finally told us that we can come pick up our security deposit and be done with it. 

I have never been so disappointed and heartbroken. We feel like we have let our daughter down because of this but there is no way we(or anyone else) could live there! We're staying at SO's mom's house for now but everything is packed away.

I wasn't planning to get pregnant, and I've been home with him ever since. I don't feel like I have post-partum depression; I don't have any thoughts of harming myself or baby, I don't find it particularly difficult to take care of myself or him. But I don't feel a lot of joy, or fierce devotion, either. 

When he babbles, and when he cries, I feel the urgent need to soothe him. The thought of him being hurt or sick breaks my heart. And yet, underneath it all is a degree of indifference to him being in my life at all. I don't relate to the parents who say they can't imagine life without their baby. I can, and in many ways, I miss that life. If you gave me the choice today of just letting someone else raise my son for a little while, I might say yes.

(Crazy enough, if I get to her right when she wakes up from a 1-2 hour nap, she's still dry).

Believe me, so I was really skeptical of the whole idea.  But the benefits have been ENORMOUS.  She spends so much less time crying, and I'm not guessing at how to make her happy.  If she's getting upset and the potty doesn't work, I know she's hungry.  If she starts rubbing her eyes, I know she's tired.

Poop is a little harder to time

I just didn't know it would actually work.  As my MIL pointed out, and one said that they have to train their babies in this manner early by 6 months, and can't use diapers b/c diaper rash would cause infections and kill them.

It works on the idea that babies have a natural instinct to not soil themselves... we actually train them INTO using diapers.  And it's really hard to break away from at 2 or 3 (or 4!) because that's when kids are developing their sense of self and will - they've got way better things to do than stop long enough to go to the bathroom

I know this was really long

First of all

Ok, our cable receiver and remote is just completely lost..fine whatever. I see things of mine randomly at her house like my $5-10 art pens and markers, vintage quilts and expensive nail polish and make up. Whatever, that's fine too but if she would have simply asked me for these things I would have happily obliged, feeling like I've been stolen from only perpetuates these negative feelings towards her. Another example, if she comes over and there is ANY dirty laundry she insists on taking it. Fine, but when I'm 7 months pregnant and have ONE pair of work pants and they mysteriously disappear only to see her wearing them 3 months later that's a problem. Also, plastic filing cabinet I had purchased and threw my files in with my husbands

I tried voicing my opinion to her and it led to her usual freak out of feeling unappreciated and unloved. She's allowed to feel however towards whomever but how dare I voice my feelings!!

1364927054.0,1bj46p,Our nearly 6 week old daughter is having seizures :-(,amazon626,48,5,16,"Sorry this is so long (tl;dr at bottom) but i wanted to share the whole story

I had my daughter on February 20 and she will be 6 weeks old on Wednesday this week. The first 5 weeks were easy, her getting poked and prodded at. Not fun times for little baby at all.

While we still don't know a ton

Her dad and I were discussing that we thought she had a cold around Monday or so because he had a cold and i had a sore throat. Later that night she was sleeping on my chest and started sucking in air strangely and jerking her whole body in towards the core. It was periodically pulling in towards her center in a pattern similar to hiccups. I thought it was that she couldn't breathe because her noise was plugged and she wasn't breathing in through her mouth so i tried to open her mouth and get her attention and then it just stopped. I didn't think much of it. But then it happened again later and i said something to her dad and he said that she'd done it while he was holding her too. He didn't seem too concerned but I knew it was something I'd never seen before and that made me nervous.

I tried to google it and found normal infant jerky limb movements due to their still developing nervous systems

We went to the er. They checked her blood oxygen, took blood and urine for testing, and finally sent us to a room up in Pediatrics. During the time we were in the er she had 4 episodes of what we now know were her having seizures. The final time it was finally seen by someone other than just myself or her dad, one of the er doctors.

After we went to the room they told us we were waiting for the neurologists to come in the morning so we tried to get some sleep, if not then definitely tomorrow. They set her up on the EEG and i think we flagged about 3 or so episodes when the neurologist came in and said it's definitely seizures. He said they were going to start her on iv medications to try to control them and were still waiting on the test results. They gave her a keppra loading dose by iv at about 4pm then more orally at around 3am and it seemed like things were finally changing. We hadn't seen her have any seizures for quite some time.

The Dr came in to talk with us the next morning. He said the neurologist had said it isn't infantile spasms which is what a lot of people online on the forum I'm part of were trying to say it sounded like, most likely after the 24 hours was passed on the eeg, to discuss things in more detail, and that they would do their best to keep us updated as soon as they knew anything.

Later on the neurologist came in and told us similar information to what the Dr had said. That it was focal motor seizures. That the medication seemed to be working. That she hadn't had any seizures since 7pm the night before. They says that they might be sending us home that day depending on the pediatric team's thoughts.They disconnected her from the EEG around noon and a new Dr came in and was observing her and she had 2 seizures in front of this Dr. This caused them to go off and debate whether they were going to let us go Friday or if they wanted to keep her longer

So this is where I get confused a bit. After we got home she was still having seizures so we called and they said to give her the 0.5 ml dose of keppra 6 hours early and then in 12 hours to up her dose to 0.7 ml since she was still having seizures. They knew she was still having them prior to her last dose at 3pm at the hospital before we were released to go so why didn't they up the dose then?

She was still having seizures even after the early extra dose and that worried me. We were kinda talking about possibly calling or going in to children's or Swedish. They want to send her in for an mri at one of those places anyway and something was better than sitting here doing nothing but waiting. But we needed some sleep and the hospital we were at had sent us away knowing she was still having them so them being amazing professional doctors we figured they knew what they were talking about. So we went to bed at home for the first time since Wednesday.

The next day we were talking about going to children's or Swedish and my overly involved family (I love them but sometimes they can be a bit much) were talking about stuff and most of it not to me. My cousin even went so far as to text me "" If you don't take her to the dr and something happens to her you could go to jail for child neglect. You can't want that"" and prior to that had told me seizures can cause brain damage and that the baby needs a Dr and etc... The Dr sent the baby home knowing she was having seizures still. I'm pretty sure that you can't go to jail for taking your baby to the Dr and having them send you home with instructions to follow up with other Dr's in 5 days. I'm pretty sure that they wouldn't call that neglect either. I ignored that text. We went to children's anyway because my mom who was in town till this morning from out of state showed up and basically demanded we take her there when we were already planning on going there anyway ourselves (like i said

At children's we spent several hours in the er waiting for them to see something and for them to get records from valley. Her dad finally got it recorded on camera and they finally got the records from the other hospital after about 2 hours. They called the neurologist she had already been seen by and agreed to start her on an additional medication called phenobarbital. They did a loading dose of that and then gave us a prescription for it.

They kept her for observation for an hour and then released us to go with orders again to make an appointment asap with the neurologist and also her pediatrician. She hasn't had any seizures that we have noticed since starting three second medication. We have an appointment with her pediatrician tomorrow and the neurologist on Thursday. They will refer us to get an mri. And hopefully then after an mri we might have some answers as to what exactly the cause of her seizures is. 

Anyone have any experience with this who can offer up some information or support?

My baby girl is just shy of 6 months old. She has never been a  ""good"" sleeper. At 6-8 weeks she had a few 4 hour stretches (in a swing)

On a nightly basis, around 2 a.m., she wakes up and is UP (not crying, just awake) for 1-1/2 to 3 hours!

She will only sleep in her travel system. I have had no luck getting her to sleep longer than a few minutes in her crib. I tried cosleeping for the first few months

I read No Cry Sleep Solution and implemented many of the strategies but she just wakes up too many times to put a sleep plan in place. I would literally have to be up all night long. I really, but I've been sitting in on  part of the naps and rocking her stroller through the transitions, so she's beginning to nap longer but with no improvement in the night wakings. I have read and read and read and have never found a description of a baby waking this frequently, which makes me feel even more alone and upset. 

We tried having dad respond to her crying

She is EBF and only just now is beginning to accept a bottle

She has no symptoms of reflux. She doesn't seem to have a belly ache. I don't consume gluten or dairy. She is happy during the day (except for the tiredness

I feel like I'm going to go insane. I'm so tired. I miss my husband. I miss my bed. I want to enjoy my baby (and my other children). There seems to be no end in sight. I don't know what to do

2 months after we got married my husband was laid off of his job. One and a half years later he is still without a reliable job (he has a part time job with very little hours working for me just to try to make ends meet). Normally I'd say
during this time, refuses to have sex with me, and actually makes my daily life and daily tasks harder. I agreed he could be a stay at home dad while I work hard for the family if he helped me clean up but he won't even do that. I come home often and the place is a mess and I even told him I'd help with any chores he needed me to but he needs to ask me for the help, but this hasn't happened.
One benefit to him is that he watches our 2 year old son while I'm at work but lately, or mean, to our son he just lashes out at me and acts like I am over-critical. I've tried to support him, provide moral support, and even threaten him with ultimatums and deadlines and none of it has worked.
At what point do I call it quits? My life would honestly be easier without him and I have tried so hard to connect with him and work on this together. Also

Advice Needed: 
How do you help someone who is closed off? How long do I hold on and deal with this? My son loves my husband but can tell I'm not happy. I think that is the hardest part of all of this. :/

I have this friend

I realise my friends life is hard. She never even wanted kids and her husband is little to no help with him. I know her parenting style differs from mine in that she mostly just doesn't even try to stop him anymore because it's just easier to clean up the mess behind him. I know she is dealing with depression. I'm not pretending to understand everything she's going through. My son is 16 months

But she blames everything wrong in her life on the kid. And I understand her life would be much simpler without the kid and she could do what she wanted. But there comes a point where you just have to take responsibility.

She's been complaining about her computer lately. She hates windows 8. Ok, it hasn't been dropped or had anything spilled on it. I suggest she takes it back. She can't. Why? Because she bought it at the BX and they don't take returns she'd have to send it to the manufacturer. Ok. So send it to them. Can't. Why? Someone(the kid) lost and or destroyed the receipt and any other paperwork she might need.

So I ask if there is nowhere in the house where you keep important paperwork? No, and you know that your son is destructive and you didn't do everything you could to keep these things you might need from him. It's not the 3 year olds fault. Where do you keep your tax papers? Yous birth certificates? your car paperwork? Surely you haven't let him destroy all that?

I was never mad at her. My whole family is sick and I'm a little short on patience

Her husband and mine are best friends. And I usually enjoy hanging out with her, all she does is complain like this on the computer. Usually its about how it feels like a waste of time when you clean the house and then the kid destroys it immediately. I've given up and trying to give her suggestions like taking him outside where its ok to be destructive, but she doesn't like going outside so it rarely happens. He's too big to play with other kids his age, and not mentally ready to play with other kids his size. The times she does take him to the park the other kids who think he is 5 are mean to him cause he is ""stupid"".

I don't want to just stop being friends with her, she is a good person and a good friend, I just don't think she is cut out to be a stay at home mom. She wants to get a job, but her husband and her argue about it because of the cost of daycare. I can't keep agreeing with her and she takes it way too personally when I disagree.

Arg. Anyway, but if I talk to my husband about it, he'll try to help by talking to her husband and it'll just get worse.",,False,,t5_2s3i3,,http://www.reddit.com/r/Mommit/comments/1gze1a/youre_the_parent_rant/

The first thing I usually see is dishes left on the floor by my fiance. Or empty beer bottles, he works a lot. But I don't think its fair to pick up after him all the time. 

Ok, and guess who is getting ready to do that today. 

The worst part is, change a diaper, and brush their teeth. If I work a short shift I get to come home and do this too. 

We are blessed that we have family that takes the kids on weekends, to church, etc. Because I work 10+ hour days on the weekends and the family loves seeing them. It sucks that I never really get a day off. Either I'm taking care of the kids and then going to work, or working all day. I know I'm probably pissing off a lot of stay at home or single moms; this probably sounds like first world problems to you guys, and I'm sorry. It just makes me sad that on weekends when they're not here, he is off work but doesn't do much except see his friends and relax. Which he is entitled to do. But it would be great if he could cross a couple things off my to-do list while I'm gone. 

And like I said, I have to ask myself what I'm doing wrong and why he doesn't think I need a break. It's getting harder and harder to just get out of bed because my life is constant work, no breaks (except to browse reddit on my phone while I'm cooking or whatever), and nothing to show for it-as far as having a good time with the kids. When we talk about it he gets all mad and tells me he's tired. I'm tired too but I guess that doesn't matter. ):

Now, intelligent, and gorgeous. She is a one year old so I can't voice to her yet how stinking proud I am of her. Tonight I realized though, the pride I feel for her is nothing compared to how proud I feel of myself.

I'm pretty modest. I don't like a lot of attention but I deserve to pat myself on the back this time.  I've been a SAHM for a year even though I desperately miss working and being with adults. I've made the best of it. We do lots of activities and play all day. Also, MSPI, oversupply, GERD, and low supply. Yet I still got through a whole year.

I'm not the perfect mom at all. I cannot count the times I just had to walk away and leave my daughter with her dad because I was so frustrated. I have used the tv to keep her distracted so I could read a book. She is still sleeping in my bed every night

One year down

Our toddler got up when we went to bed and asked if she could sleep in momma's room. I said sure. Her dad disagreed and tried to rush her back to her bed. I tried explaining that as parents, 'whatever' and went downstairs to sleep on the couch and I went to cuddle with my daughter in her room until she fell asleep. I fell asleep for a bit too. Our huge bed was completely empty for a good part of the night. And that seems wrong.

What's happened? How can someone not want to comfort their kid, even once, before this. Did I do something wrong? I mean, I did what I felt right doing. Idk.

Update2: A few things first: Thanks for all the helpful replies! Really appreciated right now. Not sure where everyone's getting that he's sleep deprived. We were just going to bed, I'd like to say that's most definitely not the case. Overall, I felt like I suddenly had two kids and woke up wondering what happened to my husband.
I posted this so that I can get outside opinions on a snapshot of how we behave. Ofcourse, I may have a big decision to make that I'm not looking forward to.
I talked to him about all this and it seems he was trying to make a stand against this becoming routine (she and I had taken a nap together in mommy's room a few days before) and he felt that she would've been 'fine' and that I should've let him put her back to bed. He went downstairs so that he could be 'out of the way'. And then we managed to start another argument when he said that he was already upset at me because I've started a new diet that 'limits' the rest of the family (buying my own foodstuffs with my own pay- there's been no toll on him or our daughter save for there's a hell of alot more bread in the house.)

My daughter had been down to one breastfeed a day for a couple of months then a few days ago she decided to drop that last feed. 

Yesterday I was not coping. At all. Everytime she cried I asked myself why I even had her. I was so angry. And so racked with guilt. How could I dislike my baby so much? She hadn't done anything. She was awesome last week

Then I clued on. I wasn't breastfeeding anymore. My body has changed again. Bye bye hormones. Once I realised that the anger and guilt started fading away. And now things are back to normal. Remembering yesterday is like looking at a different person

It seems so obvious now but no one warned me about my hormones going mental. So in case no one warned you I just wanted to let you know that when you stop breastfeeding it might be really awful for a day or two but IT WILL PASS!

My FIL is completely overbearing and everyone walks on eggshells around him because he enjoys baiting people into arguments. He must feel so small, but ignores it to his face because that's just how he's dealt with his behaviour all his life. 

I've tried everything. Last time I screamed and cursed in his face, just generally being contrary and obnoxious to anything I said or did. I don't want to be the person to cut my kid off from his grandparents, so I just bear the visits, and I don't badmouth them to him. I guess I want my son to notice how I deal with the situation (as directly as I've ever dealt with anything) rather than causing a huge drama which would result in split visits and circulating lies. He'll figure it out on his own.

He constantly buys us things because he ""loves us so much"". I feel like I'm being bought off, but it's not really just my choice alone, so the most I can do is calmly discuss things with my husband, wait for the abuse, deal with it rationally in front of everyone, and set limits as it happens.

The most I've let the two interact is his sniffing at her and occasionally licking her through the crib slats when she rolls over and reaches out for him. Until today.

After waking up from her afternoon nap

I take the angel and we sit in the glider in the nursery and I call the dog over to us. He slowly walks up to her and tentatively starts with the licking with one or two kissies making it to her face. Then the rolling giggles begin. She ""pets"" him and is rewarded with another kiss. This goes on for 15 minutes. Not once did my puppy get overexcited and start jumping nor did my daughter look bored. She was enthralled by the chocolate lab and his soft fur and wet nose.

I know some people know this already

I know for a fact now that Ozarka's hot water comes out at 180f/82c after my son was involved in an incident at his daycare (finally got the job I was waiting for and could afford it!!!) where a four year old broke the child lock equation and filled a cup with hot water, burning his lip and chin, then spilling it down his shirt.  He was quickly attended to, but the damage had been done- his skin was peeling away and blistering.  

He was rushed to the local hospital while I was contacted at work.  When I got to him, begging for food/drink while we waited for the trauma team to come give him ketamine and perform a debridement on his chest and chin.  

I guess this is just as much a public service announcement as it is a way of coping.  I didn't realize how upset this could still make me- my hands are shaking and my throat is burning.  We all know to cook on the back burner and turn pots handles in, in my wildest nightmares, think that a water dispenser could cause that much damage.  His daycare provider is devastated and had the offending unit removed from her home less than an hour after the incident.  

He is doing okay, he calms down somewhat.  The whole thing was a nightmare.  He is now open to baths again and his wounds are healing really well.  We talk about his owwies if he asks about them.  He also plays and giggles and is back to normal. :)

Please check the factory specs on your dispenser if you have a hot water option!  It could be a hidden danger.

Instead, she ordered an ultrasound. I found out I was 10 weeks pregnant. 10 weeks! How the time flew by. I knew before my period was even supposed to start that I was pregnant.

For Christmas, and grandmother-in-law Christmas cards with a letter saying I was pregnant. I've never seen my dad react the way that he did. He started crying and gave me the biggest bear hug ever. He was thrilled. He was going to be a grandfather again! I was a little weary about letting everyone know so soon, considering I've had two miscarriages in the past. But, with the birth of my daughter, I had assumed we were over the past, no more miscarriages, this baby would be fine, just like my daughter.

I go to the hospital to get the ultrasound done. I was excited. I had to pee extremely badly, don't worry"". I peek at the screen. She's taking pictures of something. It must be the baby. There's a black form on the screen. It was tiny compared to my bladder, but I just knew, it had to be my baby.

She told me to empty my bladder, so very very small. I get back into the room and was instructed to disrobe from my waist down, get on the cot and cover myself with the sheet. I did as I was told. She comes back in, and we begin the internal. I couldn't see the screen this time. Something was nagging in the back of my head, telling me something was wrong, very very wrong. If I was 10 weeks, why would an internal be needed? If that was my baby, hoping the nagging in my head would be put to rest soon.

The ultrasound tech told me to wait in the waiting room. She wasn't at liberty to speak of the ultrasound to me. She told me a doctor would be here to talk to me shortly. I was terrified. I went out and sat with my husband and told him we were waiting for a doctor to talk to us

An hour goes by, I was scared, and I was hungry. A few minutes later, the ultrasound technician comes back, and calls me over. ""I'm sorry,"" she said. ""The doctor is delivering a baby right now, and I had an emergency and had to be in the O.R."" ""It's fine, and assured me the doctor would be done soon.

My husband was getting very antsy. He was upset. Why was it taking so long? I was trying to reassure myself. Repeating the phrase ""good things come to those who wait

Finally, my husband was anxious. The doctor came in. He introduced himself and told me he hated to be so blunt, but there was no other way he could be, given the circumstance. My baby had stopped growing two weeks prior. There was no heartbeat, I was having another miscarriage.

I tried to be strong, one tear came down first, followed by a wave. The doctor was reassuring me that it was nothing I did or didn't do. It could have been the egg, or the sperm, we could try again, sometimes these things just happen. I completely lost my composure. He told me we could schedule a D&amp;C on Monday morning, they would probably have me in by the afternoon. That's if nothing happened over the weekend. I told him I wasn't sure if I wanted the D&amp;C, and brought us back out into the waiting room.

My husband held me close as we walked to the exit. A family walked by and a little girl looked to her parents and said ""I saw a woman crying! Why was she crying?"" We walked out to the parking lot, my daughter is only 14 months, she doesn't understand what happened.

Yesterday morning, I've gone through it twice before. The first time, I was 15. My mom rushed me to the hospital. I had the miscarriage at the hospital. I felt, more than anything at that point, relieved. I wasn't going to be a mother before I was legally an adult. I could go on and be a stupid teenager. I was sadly, very happy.

The last time I went through this was a month after my wedding. We were so excited! I was unknowingly a week pregnant at the wedding. When we found out, that wasn't in our cards. I was absolutely crushed. I began to worry that I couldn't carry a baby. But that February, I got pregnant again. This time, the baby was fine. I have a beautiful daughter as proof.

So when I got pregnant again, I thought we were so close to being in the clear, nothing could go wrong. I was taking care of myself, taking my prenatal every day, staying hydrated, eating balanced meals and snacks. We were going to be having another baby, the estimated due date was the day after our wedding anniversary. What a wonderful anniversary present.

I had to call my boss and let her know what was going on. Luckily

Two hours later, I had to be strong for my daughter. She needs me.

So now, I cleaned up the house. I've tried to do everything I can to keep my mind occupied, but I just can't. I broke down into tears in the middle of playing, I was barely focused on cleaning, and now looking at the kitchen, it shows. My daughter is now napping. She's not running around, getting into trouble, or does something silly.

All I can think about is how easily set off I am. Even things not related to babies are setting me off. How am I going to be able to go into work and be ""normal"" when my world seems to be shattering? I'm having a hard time talking to anyone but my husband. No one around me has gone through a miscarriage. No one I know quite understands that loss, but I can't help but try to shield her from my pain. She should be happy and care-free.

I would love nothing more than to have another baby. I love the joy and laughter my daughter brings, the second time he's seen my world collapse from around me. He doesn't want to see a third time. How can we even chance having this happen again? I don't think I'm strong enough to go through it again. The excitement of finding out we're going to have a baby, only to have it yanked away from us a few weeks later, leaving me more incomplete than before. I feel like I've lost a huge part of myself. I don't think that void was ever filled from the last miscarriage, and quite honestly, it feels as if that hole turned into a crater. How am I supposed to get past this? I feel like a complete failure, like I'm somehow less of a woman.

1327005910.0,ons01,Just spent 8 days in the hospital with my daughter...,itisyounotme,39,6,43,"My daughter is 2 months old. She was running a fever last monday and after some tests it came back that she had a bacterial infection in her blood. We went to the hospital last wednesday - at which point they ran a litany of tests on her to verify (including a spinal tap). 

They finally determined that she had a UTI which went to the bladder and then to the blood - none of which could have been prevented. I have asked 4 separate doctors...all of which said we did everything right and it was just the combination of the bacteria and my daughter's body that lead to such an extreme case of infection.

I have now had to hold my daughter while she cried and screamed during the following procedures:

* Placing an IV (successfully - twice

* Drawing blood (successfully - twice

* Intramuscular shot of antibiotics (because they blew all her veins on those 9 unsuccessful placements)

* Placement of a catheter (successfully twice

* X-Rays

* Bladder/Kidney Imaging (VCUG)  (after having not been able to eat for 7 hours)

* Ultrasound of Bladder/Kidneys 


Each unsuccessful event was 10x as difficult to deal with as the successful events.

We are going home today after 8 days; 7 days of antibiotics by IV.

So I've spent the past few years under the (apparently mistaken) impression that I would not be able to get pregnant again. I have a variety of issues with my ladyparts which, I had pretty much accepted that and was ready to move on with my career and focus on our family of three being happy, healthy, and probably traveling a lot.

There are multiple other situations complicating my feelings about this pregnancy. One is that I have miscarried at least a couple of times since having my daughter over three years ago

Second is that I'm currently finishing graduate school. I would graduate in the beginning of June, because someone will need to be with the baby once it's born (assuming all goes well), and at this point, we can't afford for either of us to stay home. 

Our three-year-old daughter is in preschool right now while I complete teaching internships and we can't afford it. We're broke
We live in a big, I would feel like we're giving up quite a bit on culture and opportunities for everyone. But we know no one here. All my schoolmates are ten years younger than me, single, no kids. 

So, as with my last pregnancy, am beginning to show already. There's no way I'll be able to hide it when I'm trying to apply for jobs, and I'm not sure I will be able to keep it under wraps before the first trimester is over. 

I keep saying ""if all goes well, I'm 37 years old, so to add another layer to my quiet panic is the potential that something could come up in tests. 

God. I am kind of a mess right now. Sorry about all of this. I guess I'm just asking for general advice, whatever anyone wants to share. I'm scared and worried. Thanks, ladies.

Your children are not your children.
They are the sons and daughters of Life's longing for itself.
They come through you but not from you
And though they are with you yet they belong not to you.

You may give them your love but not your thoughts
For they have their own thoughts.
You may house their bodies but not their souls
For their souls dwell in the house of tomorrow
which you cannot visit
You may strive to be like them
but seek not to make them like you.
For life goes not backward nor tarries with yesterday.

You are the bows from which your children
as living arrows are sent forth.
The archer sees the mark upon the path of the infinite
and He bends you with His might 
that His arrows may go swift and far.
Let your bending in the archer's hand be for gladness;
For even as He loves the arrow that flies
so He loves also the bow that is stable.",,t5_2s3i3,False,,green,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/Mommit/comments/1jmvh5/on_children_a_poem/

She's almost three. She's never slept through the night since she was born. She wouldn't go to sleep on her own

Now that she's old enough and in this defiant ""no!"" stage the entire night time routine is somewhat of a living hell. i hate to say that. i know she doesn't understand how tired i am

We've had the same routine since she was just a few months old: bath time, or thirsty, has to go potty 12 times (and doesn't actually go), needs a blankie or a stuffed animal (or 19 of them) to cuddle with, wants to watch something else, or read a different book, or whatever she can to get up again. This goes on for 4-5 hours. I often deny everything except the potty trips. We don't end up actually sleeping until 12 or 1 AM. Sometimes she's stayed up till 2. I have to get up at 6:45 but I am late every single morning because I'm so f*cking exhausted and it's so hard to get out of bed. 

I was never one who believed that you should put a tv in a kids room but I figured I would try it because maybe she would fall asleep watching a movie and then I could go to sleep. But it doesn't work

I don't understand these people I know whose kids go to bed at 8 or 8:30 and sleep through the night

My husband can't really help cuz he has to get up at 4am to go to work. So I have to deal with this by myself and then I have to get up and get her ready to go in the morning alone too. Not only am I exhausted but I never have time to myself either. I know thats a horrible thing to say because you're supposed to devote yourself to your kids and give them 100% of your time but on the other hand

Her Dr acts like some kids are just like this and there isn't anything I can do but deal with it. I don't know what to do about it either. I don't want to feel resentful toward her, but at the same time I just want to sleep. :( 

****edit**** Update: we tried the supernanny thing last night, but i still consider this somewhat of a success. I'm going to keep trying it and will let you guys know how it goes after 10 days or so. THANK YOU everyone for all of your input, advice, suggestions, empathy, everything, i can't tell you how grateful I am! Thanks again!!

I am 29, almost 4 and 20 months.  I am a stay at home mom, so for the most part I take care of the day to day chores.  Cooking, cleaning, laundry, pick up at school, grocery shopping, etc.  I know I'm fortunate to stay home, so no overtime for these extra hours

This year I started teaching dance classes twice a week (Wednesday nights and Saturday mornings).  Those two days DH is in charge of the girls

So--to the topic at hand.  I was at class last night...I come home---WAYYYY past everyone's bedtime, and cartoons blaring.  When I went to move my 20 month old, she was COVERED in poop.  Like it leaked through the diaper, through her pj's onto the couch.  Of course I had to change her, which of course woke her up, and I had to put her to bed.  I know he works all day, but WHY can't he just do what he's supposed to do.  This happens constantly.  He doesn't help me at all, and he sleeps when he's supposed to be watching our children.  My 20 month old is in no way, but if she's being too quiet while I'm cleaning or something

I try to calmly and rationally explain to him how I feel when I come home to my kids bouncing off the walls, he fell asleep, what do I want from him?  I want you to watch your children!  I want you to follow the bedtime routine that we--together--started with our kids since they were born.  I'm not asking you to clean, cook, etc.  I'm asking you take care of our children.

This morning was my last feeding. He's fine with it; he knows he gets more from the bottle so he hasn't really been wanting the breast for awhile.

It's just breaking my heart. I was planning on breastfeeding for a year; exclusively for 6 months. It was hard enough to add formula (which quickly became his main source of calories) at 1 month

It's so frustrating, you've done so well, most moms would have given up by now."" Well, that doesn't help me, because I'm not most moms, I'm the mama of MY little boy and he NEEDS me and I feel like I have failed him. Yes, he gets the calories he needs, but it's killing me that I no longer have the option of breastfeeding.

I don't really have a question or anything... just needed to vent a little.

I have an 8 month old girl who's had issues with eczema since she was about 5 months. I'm a young

Two days ago my husband got a call from child protective services saying that someone reported my daughter being abused and we had to go in for an interview. I freaked out thinking of every little thing I've done wrong since she was born trying to think if there was anything that would get my baby girl taken away from me. I was so scared that I almost threw up on the way there today.

Once we get there the worker explains that the complaint said I was negligent with my daughter. She then told me that the person said

1). My daughter didn't have a crib 

2). Had a severe diaper rash that I wasn't taking care of.

3). Had scratches all over because I wasn't taking care of her eczema.

4). The outside of our house was dirty and cluttered.

As soon as she said this I knew it was my grandmother who called. I know she called just to make it harder on me and my husband because she basically lied about everything. She was the one who gave us a crib, and the house that we are staying at doesn't have grass so we park the cars inside the gated area(which the worker said didn't even matter because It's not like we live in the front yard). 

I'm just so hurt that my own grandma would do this to me. She's called me a bad mother more than once which has caused me to stay very distant from her but this makes me want to just cut her out of my and my baby's lives. She's made up things(like my husband being an alcoholic) in the past that I could forgive and forget but this time she's trying to get my daughter taken away from me.

Some back story. When she was born she was only 6'7 which I'm told is on the small side. She had a few months where she would only fall asleep if I was in the bed with her feeding her a bottle and it usually took a few small bottles to get her to sleep. I indulged her because I was sleep deprived myself and had a pretty severe case of the baby blues. I'm fully aware that wasn't the right thing to do but hindsight is always 20/20. I stopped over feeding her as soon as I realized how bad it got. 
We've had genetic tests, feeding her 6 small meals a day, feeding her 3 meals that always followed a pattern (fruit for breakfast, fruit and veggie for lunch, protein and veggie for dinner) and more other ways than I can list. She only drinks skim milk, crystal light, or water. Everything she eats is low fat, sugar free

We have a 2 year old girl and I think my husband's internet usage isn't normal. He is on his ipad from the minute he wakes up to the minute he goes to bed and during the day he sits on the couch on his ipad. It's really frustrating because our time with our girl is so limited because we both work and he chooses to be on the internet. 

Although he doesn't totally ignore our daughter, he just lets her go all over the house while he's on his ipad. I've found her playing in the toilet, turning on the water in the tub, playing in the fridge, chewing on electrical cords and when I come back into the room, he's like I don't know where she went...

It's really frustrating because I want him to have a strong relationship with his daughter but it seems like he just doesn't have time or doesn't really care. She really clings to me and I know it really bothers him and I just think if he were capable of just putting down the ipad and hang out with her and give her his undivided attention for more than a few minutes than she would feel more comfortable around him. 

While he is browsing the internet, even when I ask, I get an eyeroll or he doesn't hear me because he isn't paying any attention. I feel really taken advantage of.

I've brought this up before and he blames me because I'm doing stuff and he's bored or I don't pay any attention to him but when I try

1347716597.0,zxb6k,Husband won't get life insurance or stop smoking.,blooz1,43,11,60," I am so frustrated with my husband. I just don’t understand him at all. He has always smoked
    He then stopped for about four months. When he restarted I was disappointed in him but resigned to the fact that it was his life. I was breastfeeding our son but he continuously offered me cigarettes to try and get me to resume smoking. I totally accept that it is pointless to nag/ask him to stop. He gets very angry and snappy with me if I dare mention it.  
Now here is the problem – He has no life insurance. He has been smoking 20+ a day for about 20 years and REFUSES to get life insurance. I have begged him to get insurance. I am terrified that he will get cancer and leave my 19 month old son and I with no money.  
    This may sound selfish but I do not want to raise my child alone and in poverty
     I think you know where I am going with this. He refuses to register with a doctor and will not give me his NHS number so I have no way of signing him up. We live in England so it is not as if it will cost him anything to sign up. Last week he insinuated that if he had insurance I would have him “bumped off”.

I'm very frustrated because I've seen how she talks and disciplines him: grabbing him by the ear from a sitting position and LIFTING him up by it, like that she's teaching him that the rules of common courtesy or social order don't apply to him. IDK. It's like she's raising that asshole who cuts you in line at the store, and I'm just venting. 

Buuuut I still have to share a bus stop with her every day (yes

(I can provide more details backing up my claim that her poor way of delivering messages to him is going to be damaging to his psyche if anyone is curious.)

My question is: When she allows her son to cut in front of the 2 kids waiting patiently

TL;DR: Mom at the bus stop thinks her son is above waiting his turn and I'm not sure how to teach my kids to deal with assholes who think they can take whatever they want.

I want to give you an inside view of what goes on in a daycare
First off, we want to teach them too.
Do not put your child in a center that isn't educational. This isn't babysitting, make sure the center is educational. 


Other things to make sure of:
Is there a routine and schedule posted (preferably in a way children can understand)?

Do children have chances to develop math, gross and fine motor skills?

Are nutritious meals and outdoor time provided?

Does the center have a comprehensive parent handbook that outlines their policies?

Is the classroom multicultural? Do the staff get to know the families and children individually?

Is the staff/child ratio acceptable? Where I live

Do children, and a consistent sub?

Is everything sanitary? No obviously old and dirty toys or furniture

Are they licensed? Please don't put your child in a center that isn't licensed. Also

Do the staff call the children by their names

Is there a discipline policy you agree with?

Are you welcome to stop in any time? Make sure you do!

Are there sufficient toys and materials? Can children reach them? Are they labeled?

Is there a quiet spot for children to go when they are overwhelmed and need to rest?

Also ask the lead teacher or administrator what education the staff have. You want people with degrees, but actual employees should have background and education regarding child development.
Do they send out a newsletter?

Some other things to consider:
Child care workers are here to help you! If you need resources, early intervention services, therapists, etc.

Non state funded daycares are not required to take children with special needs. They are probably not equipped for it. You'd be better off taking a child with special needs to some place like Head Start

We are trying to help your child. Please work with us when for toilet training and disciplining. You have to be on board with us

Parents are often the problem. It doesn't do your child any favors if you aren't disciplining him or her.

Home and family daycares are a great option! If there is one adult working in their home with children, there can be twelve. I personally love this atmosphere, it is very family like. Just do your research. Talk to other parents, make sure they're licensed, check online to make sure they haven't had issues.


Now, we care. Of course, we don't like every child. That's often a lack of discipline problem at home (children need rules, structure, consequences and discipline. You won't be helping them by not doing these things). But we take great care of every child and want to teach them. Some children we genuinely love, especially if they come in as infants. Sometimes we do silly things (I have gone to the bathroom with a baby on my lap because she was sick and I didn't want to put her down). We are people too. Please try to be on time, let us know what's going on at home, trust us, especially if children are there a lot of the time. Your child needs to bond with us too. If you've picked a quality place

I feel like I am drowning in my life right now. Every morning when I wake up, and I come up with nothing. I feel like a caged animal. 

My little boy is 8 months old now and growing fast. I love him dearly but we have our struggles

Because of this

We have not had sex or anything even remotely close since before the baby was born. Part of this is logistical - the baby's room is right next to our room with just a half-wall separating them so there is really no privacy. And

I am up to my ears at work with stress and being busy. Things were bad before I had the kid, and even though he says he's not mad at me, I still feel his anger and it makes me feel helpless.

If I quit my job, my house because we're in the middle of renovations. 

Oh yeah, which means spending way more money than I am used to on groceries, and also I do not feel like it's helping me eat healthy and lose the baby weight that I am still carrying around. Which makes me feel like crap physically. 

My relationship with my boyfriend has degenerated to the point where we barely speak. At this point I don't even really know what's going on. I don't know if we're both just exhausted and stressed out

I am as guilty as he is. When I get home from work, but even when I do, I feel like my BF does not even notice or care. 

We do not have any friends. I am friendly with a few people at work, because our house is a wreck. And I can't really see taking our baby out to a restaurant with us. 

My BF's mom has offered to baby-sit

We're falling behind financially. My BF is also working a lot of hours to try to make up the difference, but it's expensive. The thought of having to pull him out of there because we can't afford it just makes me want to cry. 

I know I should talk to my BF about all this, tonight is going to be the night that we are going to talk this out. And then I go downstairs and he will say something to me that makes me feel like everything's fine and it's the way things used to be. And I wuss out and don't say anything. And another day goes by. 

I keep asking myself if this is depression. But I honestly don't think it is. I do not think I would feel this way if there was just some part of my life right now that did not make me feel sick to my stomach to think about.

I don't really know what I'm looking for here, R, anymore, but I love her like a sister and when we spend time together we have so much fun.  Her daughter is 6 months older than my son, and they get along fairly well.  The issues I have are with how she parents.  Her daughter, A, was diagnosed with autism at around 18 months.  I don't know the details, occupational and physical therapy several times a week.  However, which won't be until she is 5/6.  R says she ""can't handle the screaming"" so A watches TV all. day. long.  I am no anti-TV-fanatic, they put shows on the iPad and set it up on the table in front of her plate.  To go shopping or in the car or out to eat

R and her husband set absolutely zero boundaries for A and it is so difficult to spend time with them that my husband has said he absolutely will not anymore.  We had one family outing with them almost a year ago and it was so painful that we didn't try again until this weekend, trying to go up down escalators, playing with fountains, knocking over displays in gift shops, crawling in the street, etc.  R doesn't require her to even hold hands, they just let A do whatever she wants because she screams if they try to stop her.  Several times they would tell her not to do something and the instant she screamed, but we have boundaries, etc.) that is not the time for exploration

Since A's autism diagnosis, she refuses to see that the blog posts and anecdotes she relies on are not actual scientific data.  She is aware that I vaccinate my kids and doesn't bring the issue up to me directly or in person, but she is always posting about how sad it is that parents don't ""do their research"" about vaccines and whether or not it is passive aggressively targeted at me, it *feels* like it is and makes me angry.

I really don't know what to do.  The final straw is my husband just found out today that R, both of which have been studied in pregnant women and been proven safe, because of ""risks,"" but will eat/smoke pot which has been studied with inconclusive and contradictory results.  Every few months I decide that I just won't call R anymore and will let the friendship die - we live about a half hour drive away from each other, so we have a hard time coordinating get togethers anyways - but I always forget or decide it must not have been that bad last time and give her another chance.  

I also firmly believe that we need to fight the ""mommy wars"" by not judging other parents for their choices, but come on...she isn't just putting her own kids at risk, she's putting my baby who hasn't completed his vaccines yet at risk, as well as anyone who can't have vaccines because of allergic reactions or happens to not have the proper immune response to them.  In a recent conversation on Facebook, she told someone that since diseases like measles were already being reduced by measures like hand washing and modern hygiene, we don't need vaccines at all.

First off, a creamed spinich-esque mucousy poop, he poops once every day or two, the normal thick mustardy poop a breast fed baby is ""supposed"" to have. In the beginning I wondered why his poop was so green, but was told that all sorts of colours can be normal and not to worry about it. I now see it was a symptom of him not using my milk very efficiently. And finally, he always had a touch of diaper rash we could never get quite under control, that was the first thing to go when I cut out milk. As an added bonus to me I've lost 5 pounds without trying!

So if your baby has eczema, green mucousy poops, blood in his stool, lots of gas and fussiness, please consider an elimination diet to see what the triggers are.

I asked him to loan me his DS when he went to bed

I'm not mad. I want to get that straight first. I'm not thinking, and sexuality. He is presently trying to grasp his sexuality and sexual identity (which I support fully, however he identifies).

He has previously said he didn't look at porn and when we have talked about his random erections and other puberty issues he hasn't seemed to indicate much sexual attraction or interest. Of course

I went through the site and am pretty much ambivalent about him looking at porn, or even more fetishy stuff. 

I'd rather not have him delving into fetish porn so young

How do you start the discussion? How do you put it in the proper context?

He’ll be 3 in February. T is overall a good, reading books, playing games, etc. On my days off when I’m cleaning or some other organizing activity, he’s usually fantastic about occupying himself. He has a new puppy which he cleans up after, takes outside to the backyard on his own, etc. 

Lately, got the puppy all muddy, wouldn’t listen at dinner time, hit the other animals. Woke up this morning, colored on the carpet in sharpie (thank god we were already getting that replaced), colored all over himself, used his toy pliers to pinch the puppy’s ear, didn’t want what I gave him for breakfast

The eating thing has been going on the past couple weeks, I’ve been making simple meals that he LOVES and yet won’t eat. I’ve done the whole, if you don’t eat this now this is what you’ll eat later until you finish it. It works. Sometimes. 

He rarely naps. I’ve been trying to change our schedule up somewhat, just to give him atleast some quiet time. Most of the time that he naps it’s because he was throwing a tantrum in his room and passed out. I’m sure today though when I drive around 6-7 to pick up SO (we share a car right now), he’ll fall asleep, be super cranky at dinner time right after we get home, and have trouble going back to sleep. 

At bed time, etc), he starts STALLING. And he knows what’s good and bad. “Mama, I want to brush my teeth.” “No mama, take Carson out to go pee.” “Mama, I gotta pee.” “Mama I need water.” I tried letting him accomplish those things then get back to the original task, or flip it. “Put on your pajamas and then we’ll take Carson out.” “We brush our teeth next, it’s time to read a book and go to sleep. He’ll try to get up to pee about 8 more times.

What do I do? I feel bad for constantly putting him in time-out when he’s bad. While writing all this out, but I am stressed over it. He’s usually worse right before he goes to his dad’s, which is this weekend, and I don’t know how to stop it. He has stopped throwing his tantrum now and I sat him at his easel to color, but it is only a matter of time before I turn my back and he colors on the puppy or does something else he normally doesn’t do. I mostly needed this just to rant but..some advice would be grateful. Routines are hard, some days I work nights and some days I work days. SO works days, which also vary.

See, you learn which situations you can and cannot use swear words.  It's a part of developing social awareness.  I just don't understand what makes ""bad words"" so bad just because of age.

I have a boy that just turned 3 and a 2 month old little girl.  I recently quit my job to stay home for the next two years to raise my children.  I haven't changed how I talk at home and not surprisingly, I sincerely don't give a shit.

I can see how this might ruffle some feathers down the road so here's what I imagine my first encounter with a teacher regarding this matter might be like:

Teacher:  We have a serious problem with your son.
Me:  Oh really?  What happened?
Teacher:  I heard him say something bad on the playground today.
Me:  What did he say?!
Teacher:  He used the ""F"" word.
Me:  In what context?
Teacher:  It doesn't matter what context it was
Me:  Why not?
Teacher:  Because it's a bad word and he's still a child!
Me:  Did he use it to hurt someone's feelings?
Teacher:  No
Me:  So?
Teacher:  So?!  It's a bad word and he shouldn't say it!!!  Would you allow your son to watch violent movies or drink alcohol before he's ready?
Me:  Of course not.  Seeing something really violent might give him nightmares and his growing body is obviously not prepared to handle anything as harmful as alcohol.  
Teacher:  So you see my point
Me: No.
Teacher:  Well
Me: Well in that case

Then after I leave

So seriously

tl:dr- Why shouldn't I let my kids cuss?

edit:  Wow, ""anything else you'd like to share?""  The reason, she said, was that the word itself didn't hold any power unless it was fueled by reaction.  She explained to me that words are powerless until our response teaches the child what powers their words have.  By not acting outraged, she takes away the power to be abusive with the word.  That was the first time I ever thought about seeing a curse word as just another word by simply changing my reaction to it.  And so, over time, I've come to feel differently about words and how they're used and how I'll raise my kids in a world where these words exist.  I know not everyone feels the same about expletives, peeing on a tree in the park).  It's not that I want them to swear

The kids on my bus were playing with {my son} and he was, don't they?"" another: ""I want a baby so bad!""

 

So I, there's a reason why babies are so cute and also a reason why animals eat their young. Everyone says how awful newborns can be- but they are wrong. Newborns are easier than you think. Sure, you're sleep deprived, the baby is constantly on you, and if you're nursing, your chest will hurt. Your body will still be recovering and your hormones out of whack, but these will be the easiest times for a long time.

 

Because newborns start rolling over before you realize and you will be so proud. Then they start to get up on their knees and rock- you're still proud! Look at my baby! Then they start to crawl and no longer stay where you put them and the horror sets in- stuff just got real. Then the speed crawling, it seems.

 

You will crave those sleep deprived newborn days- anything over the little turd in your cabinets, the screaming; the endless hours of screaming when they stay up too late and are too wired to sleep; the frustration when they realize how adults communicate and that they are pre-verbal, so now they hit, bite, pinch, and yell at home, in public- and you will be looked at like you're just AWFUL. Babies are cute until they are yours.

 

They're worth it, so much more difficult than they are made out to be. Please wait until you're older, more mature, have been able to live a little, and have the income to support the butt creams, the soaps, the clothes, and the formula- GOD THE FORMULA. They will be so much cuter when you have the patience and are not fighting to make ends meet.""

 

There was a considerable amount of time where there was silence. One kid made a sound of disgust- ""I'm NEVER having kids.""

I thought this might be entertaining.  The faces of some of these kids were just horrified.  I should have mentioned the poosplosions in the middle of a store when you have forgotten the extra set of clothes- and possibly the diaper in the car- then have to parade around your naked (diapered child) or dash to the car while they pee down your side.

The ER Doctor believes it could either be gastro or a milk allergy. I still suspect it's more so the allergy as her nose was also congested and one of her eyes watery

Well since that post I've really tried to take a step back and try some of your suggestions bc I didn't enjoy being that kind of mommy. We're making great progress! I've been trying to talk calmly as much as possible and give him more warnings when it's almost time to do something so it doesn't come as such a shock. When he refuses to do something like take a bath I just walk out of the room and start to fill the bathtub up, and it's been working pretty good. I've found that by me staying calm he stays calm and we're able to work it out much better. We're still a work in progress but I wanted to thank you ladies so much. I think a large part of it was that I was just so frustrated in MY life that I was redirecting my frustrations on him, and that's not fair. I feel very bad and am trying to make it better for us. We've been working on the alphabet (I got some flash cards) and he's picking it up pretty good! He's been pretty good about bed time (however last night was horrible, probably one of his worst nights in a LONG time. He just kept screaming and crying. I tried to let him cry it out but finally went in and told him if he didn't calm down id turn his night light off. It worked but I felt bad having to threaten him like that) But thankfully that's not the norm.

Anyways I just wanted to thank you all for your thoughts and suggestions. And wanted to let you know your advice did not go untaken!
