It's sad that they had to push for Season 9. Losing Toby and Kelly, and Dwight (who will be working on the spinoff, I assume) will really hurt the show. Not nearly as much as Catherine Tate becoming full-time, though. God, she is insufferable. Its like the producers said ""She is possibly the most hated character in the history of the show, lets make the show revolve around her now. That will boost ratings.""

**Michael**: So I was thinking, maybe going for one of those ice-cream cakes from Baskin-Robbins. Those are very good. Very Delicious.
**Angela**: Meredith's allergic to dairy
**Michael**: She's not the only one that's going to be eating it, it's not just about her, so...
**Pam**: It is... her birthday.

I hadn't realised the significance of Michael's scene in his last episode where the party planning committee are having a meeting...

**Meredith**: [to Michael] We decided on the ice cream. Mint chocolate chip
**Michael**: Mmm!
**Phyllis**: Yeah that was a surprise...
**Michael**: You know what
**Pam**: [surprised] Okay.
**Michael**: Tomorrow I want everyone to have a good time. No drama. And as for today
**Pam**: Should we get toppings?
**Michael**: What do you like Pam?
**Pam**: [confused] What?
**Michael**: What kind of toppings would you like?
**Pam**: Hot fudge?
**Michael**: Sounds good. Fudge it up!
