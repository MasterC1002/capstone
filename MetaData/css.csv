What does that mean for you?  Nothing too drastic.  I like this community and would like to see it continue to operate the way it has independently, you'll know that I have a very hands-off approach to moderating.  I don't feel the need to micromanage a community.

1. No spam.
2. Be nice.

The sidebar spends some time explaining those two items

That last point, why does it need me?  To answer, I'll give you an aviation metaphor: even the best autopilot needs a person to land the plane (which is not actually true anymore, but just give me enough leeway to say that it is for our purposes).  I won't interfere with your posting, but if your posts accidentally get stuck in the spam filter, now you have someone to ask to dig it out.  I will also try to grow this community so that we have a robust userbase with a lot of knowledge and experience to draw on.

Finally, I will take what I've learned about styling reddit and apply it here in a way that makes us look both unique and innovative.

I'm confused as hell, clean set of code, with tools that make the job easier, not require you to spend days learning and configuring them.


I learned Compass and have been using it (it's really good for making cross-browser stuff less of an issue and gives you CSS variables, but it doesn't interact with compass. Right now I've got HTML5 boilerplate with its css ripped out and compass spitting out its css, plus the zen grid compass plugin. I can't help but think: this should be a lot simpler. This is too many plugins for your plugins, a rabbit hole of github projects and framework-ception.


So what's your 'stack'? Is the one I described not actually that complicated? What's a realistic toolkit for what I'm doing?

So the idea is simple. Split a box into two sub-boxes.
The trick is that everything should be percentual - no fixed sizes (EDIT: apart from potential margins).

One way to do it is setting a *float:left* to both sub-boxes and their *width*s to 80% and 20% respectively. The problem with this method is that some browsers will break the second box into a new line. This can be avoided by setting the widths to 79% and 19% or something similar

So how do we do this cross-browser without any gaps?

So what do we know?  Only that ""staminified dawg"" has yet to be indexed --we still don't know if the {display: none} and {visibility: hidden} tags have had an effect.  

The next step is to make the {content: """"} tags visible on the page and get somethign else indexed at the same time  I guess we'll get a little bit more of an answer then.

One of the guys from engadget said on Twit the other day they were planning on converting as much of the site as possible from graphics to CSS in the future.  I believe we can probably do more with less bytes in CSS but the clientside processing performance seems to take a hit with the more things you add where as images are rendered fairly quickly even on older machines.,t5_2qifv,True

I have a mock website and am having some trouble with the positioning of my &lt;div&gt; tags.

Here's the website: https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/31206290/Website%20Mockup/Home.html

What I'm trying to do is get the three left &lt;div&gt; tags to be stacked on top of each other on the left side of the screen while the content tag stays on the right side.

I've floated the tags to the left and right though it seems it's stacking them horizontally rather than vertically when I do that. Is there a simpler solution to moving my tags to the side of the screen or is it my method of vertical positioning that's the issue.

As always

*I am not developing a Web page* or anything that is going to be used by anyone except me. Rather

Secondly, and so on. I have a [Greasemonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/) userscript that I made that allows me to style these pages.

So

    body.userscript-ff-imagedocument img.decoded {
      background-image: url(""data:image/png;base64
      background-size: 5px auto !important;
      background-color: rgb(240
      box-shadow: 0 0 1em rgba(0, 0.75);
    }

(""userscript-ff-imagedocument"" is the class which my userscript adds to the BODY tag when it detects an `ImageDocument`.)

This background image allows me to easily see where transparency exists in the image. However, which makes it difficult to tell where the image really has transparency and where that's just part of the image. (The `background-size` property makes it a bit easier because the background will move around a little when zooming due to Firefox quirks, but this is obviously not optimal.)

And the CSS:

     .sourcreamstandard img {

     }

     .sourcreamtag1 img {
     	height:50px;

     	position: relative;
     	top: -50px;	
	
     }

     .sourcreamtag2 img {
     	height:50px;
     	weight:50px;
     	position: relative;
     	top: -100px;	
     }

     .sourcreamtag3 img {
     	height:50px;
     	weight:50px;
     	position: relative;
     	top: -150px;	
     }

     .sourcreamstandard
     	display:none;
     }

     .sourcreamtag1 #tag1:target img {
     	height:400px;

     	display:none;	
     }

     .sourcreamtag3
     	display:none;	
     }
  
And so on, the images while take on the CSS classes which hide them or resize them when appropriate. I'll go through and add some CSS3 stuff to get smooth transitions for image resizing once I get this working.
