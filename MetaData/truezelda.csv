1368389774.0,1e78e0,The Hero of Time as a Tragic Character,DriedFrupcakes,99,9,27,"The following is an analysis/discussion on the character of the Link that appears in Ocarina of Time and Majora’s Mask. 

I’m not necessarily referring to him as a tragic character in the Shakespearean sense (a character whose downfall is the fault of his own attributes) but rather in the traditional sense of the word: as a particularly sympathetic character

- In terms of origin, and he later had to realise that the first 10 years of his life were, essentially, a lie. The death of his father figure thrusts him into his adventure, and during his quest some other notable characteristics and cruel fates await him.

- On his journey, Princess Ruto, Cremia in Majora’s Mask, and his lack of participation in the festival from the same game. While all of the Links were required to witness certain horrors, this Link had just about everything he loved taken from him by the end of his games. All of the friends he had made in OoT became sages, and Zelda herself had to send him away. He could not return to the forest home he once knew. Navi left him. His good deeds in Termina go without reward, and possibly never truly noticed.

I’m actually extremely impressed by this Link’s determination despite his ‘terrible fate’. Where SS Link seemed loving and TP Link had tenacity

- This Link’s fate after his adventures may be the saddest aspect of all. He has 3 outcomes: to die in discontent and linger

He was first a boy trapped in an adult’s body

For these reasons, and as a young adult his complete sense of altruism is what caused his demise, riddled with absolute discontent at not being able to be…a hero to all, I suppose. I imagine he died protecting or helping someone else as he’d always done, and his ache for helping others lead to an early death, as he would not seem content with merely settling down. I own and am aware that Hyrule Historia suggests that TP Link and OoT Link are related; however the word descendant can be interpreted loosely, since we know through SS that every Link is technically a descendant or successor to the last, it is more gripping, and living vicariously through his successor.

So

Like I said

A direct conversion Hyrule - to - Earth would be :

(5 min * 60 s/min) + (30s) = 330 s / day

(330 s / day) / (24 hr / day) =  13.75 s / hr

So 13.75 seconds Hyrule time corresponds to 1 hour Earth time. However, for instance) but would imply a planet which, like Earth, has an axial tilt (the planet's axis is tilted relative to its sun, which is why the days and nights aren't equal in length) - and if you have a planet with axial tilt, you have a planet in which the length of daylight vs dark would change over the course of the year (like they do on Earth.) You'd also have seasons for the same reason.

However, so far as I know, you don't have to sit and watch Link sleep for roughly 1/3 of the game) the time you are playing represents all of his waking hours - so the fact that you have nearly three times as much daylight as nighttime corresponds to a standard diurnal schedule, in which most of your waking hours correspond to when the sun is up, with only a few waking hours when the sun is down. In this case, if we assume Link has eight hours a day of off-camera sleeping/eating/bodily functions/etc, then the in-game time represents only 16 hours, every 20.625 seconds Hyrule time corresponds to an hour Earth time, which the game mercifully skips.",t5_2tfzp

What if the end of ALttP occurred *solely* within the Sacred Realm.  Specifically, which was a reflection of Ganon's heart.

My theory is that when Link touched the Triforce at the end of ALttP, Link's uncle still being alive, all of Link's new friends living happy, fulfilling lives--may have been part of the Sacred Realm.  In this sense, when Link touched the Triforce, the Sacred Realm may have become a ""Golden World"" where all of Link's wishes were true, and the ""real"" world may have been unaffected.

This would have dramatic consequences.  If this idea is true, since Link's uncle is still dead, and Link is in his own Golden World, the ""real"" world would also be without a hero.

So far, the Light World were the Sacred Realm--created by Link at the end of ALttP--and the Dark World were the ""real"" world that had degraded and turned into a wasteland over the years without a king or hero.

As I think about it

The downside to the Zelda I way is that it can become quite frustrating. I remember poring over Nintendo Power and Strategy Guides with my brother before we could figure out the original Zelda. But I feel in today's internet age

So with that said

*(I haven't played Zelda II or Four Swords so I have to abstain from including those).*

1. Wind Waker - we can debate ad nauseum about the sailing

2. A Link to the Past - I didn't play this when I was young, and basically no hand-holding.

3. Ocarina of Time - I will forever remember the moment, ""See that mountain? We get to actually *go* there."" My first real experience with 3d gaming (other than Wolfenstein), and my mind was completely blown.

4. Zelda I - I already mentioned my memories playing with my brother. More than any other Zelda

5. Twilight Princess - What we dreamt of for so long: a massive

6. Majora's Mask - Don't get me wrong, there is a very specific destination and that's basically all that you can do. One of the great strengths of MM, its side quests, really helps so that you don't feel like you're on rails, but most of the side quests, for me, didn't provide the adventure I was looking for.

7. Skyward Sword - Fi. No real overworld. The sky could have been so great and it felt even more sparse than TP (I remember thinking ""well, its because you don't have the ladder. Makes sense. In WW, its KoRL telling you ""don't go there."" And by SS, you have to place a tablet to make a beam shoot up through the clouds.

1359868499.0,17sl6m,"""Divine prank"" mystery solved by Historia",maxvalent,47,9,21,"There have been lots of theories on the ""Divine Prank

The ""Divine Prank"" refers to the fact that when Ganondorf was executed in TP, he was banished to the Twilight Realm.  Fans have debated precisely why these events occurred.

Some fans have argued that Ganondorf did NOT possess the Triforce of Power, the Triforce mark merely meant that Ganondorf was somehow chosen or blessed by the gods, even though he didn't have the Triforce of Power.

Well, the Triforce of Courage stayed with him (pg. 110).  The Historia doesn't detail precisely how or why, but it does say that this event caused Ganondorf to possess the Triforce of Power in the childhood timeline, despite never entering the Sacred Realm or touching the Triforce (pg. 113).

Based on this confirmation

The other, 1x Power and Wisdom), and the other timeline has only 2 pieces (only Power and Wisdom).  To fix this paradox, basically the Adult Courage piece returned to the Adult timeline, and the Childhood Triforce split, so that childhood Link would still have the Triforce of Courage in his possession.  The splitting then caused the Triforces of Power and Wisdom to go to Ganondorf and Zelda, respectively.

Most of the games take place during a period of technological decline.

I'm pretty sure we've had this discussion on here before.

1) Teleportion - Quite possibly the most common 'magic' seen in the series. No elaboration necessary

2) Time Travel - Also pretty self explanatory. Lots of science.

3) Lens of Truth - X- ray device.

4) Nayru's Love/Magic Armour/Cane of Byrna - Force field.

5) Power bracelet/glove - Anti-gravity generators.

6) Fire/Ice abilities (arrows

7) Dominion Rod - Another self explanatory one. Practically screams technology posing as magic.

8) Gust Jar/Gust Bellows - It's a vacuum cleaner. Duh.

9) Magic Boomerang - Guidance system

10) Ocarina - Uses soundwave configurations as auditory command functions to perform various abilities.

11) Wind Waker/Rod of Seasons - Extreme weather manipulation.

12) Twilight Princess Sage Ghosts - Holograms!

13) Triforce - Massive replicator? Space/Time manipulator? That's a hard one.",,t5_2tfzp,1357525770.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/truezelda/comments/1623t9/magic_technology_lets_look_at_this/

THERE IS NO WORLD. It felt to me to be the most hollow rendition of Hyrule yet. The only civilization in the game was in Skyloft, but the execution, in my opinion, wasn't too great.

Seeing as it would be the main hub for NPC interaction, they should've made it a much more interesting place to be as the game evolved.

3) It Gives us a Hyrule to Revisit

The incarnation of OOT's Hyrule, the fans' favorite version of Hyrule. For the most part, when fans think of ""Hyrule,"" they think of a Hyrule Field, a Death Mountain, a castle, a forest, Zora's River, we would be able to see this Hyrule Kingdom in the adult timeline. This would provide several cool opportunities. Perhaps Kakariko would be the most populated city; the opposite of Twilight Princess. The New Deku Tree would be alive in this timeline

2) One More Shot at Ganondorf

Ganondorf (and by extension, is *THE* villain of the Legend of Zelda. In most of his incarnations, he has been an incredibly well written and dangerous villain. Unfortunately, the opportunities to use him are being exhausted. Ganondorf, at this point, has been defeated in Ocarina of Time, and then twice more in the respective timelines that branched out of it. To revisit him as a villain, which, seeing as we know how things turn out, and when he did

1) The Stakes Are High

There's something to be said about what you're fighting for in a video game. Some may argue against it, the higher the payoff will be. This is why I didn't feel particularly satisfied when I beat Twilight Princess. While a fantastic game, I felt as if the game never put much on the line. The villain never did anything particularly noteworthy. It's as if he was GOING to do bad things to Hyrule if you lost, but we never saw it happen. We dispelled the Twilight, but never even felt the payoff in the real world because the citizens of Hyrule *didn't even know it was there*. Ganondorf made his appearance, and yet, all he managed to do was create a big diamond prism around Hyrule Castle. Most of Castle Town, seemed stupidly oblivious to what was happening. So, or establishes beforehand the stakes that are at hand

This is a game where Hyrule, and where the bad guy wins? The simple answer is to take the storyline that already exists, and to expound upon it in a way that switches the victory to the player. An example of this is Halo: Reach. (Spoilers follow) We played a game defending a planet that we knew was doomed. We knew that Master Chief was the Last Spartan, and that consequently your Spartan and his team would all die. And yet, the game was able to keep the stakes high and invest the players in completing a mission that would allow us to *win*. The last mission focused on securing the AI Cortana, and safely delivering her to the Pillar of Autumn as the Covenant destroyed the planet. You are ultimately successful, and in the end, the good guys lost

Bringing this back to Zelda, and make the known outcome a lessened version of that. Say, then, that Ganondorf reached such power that he was capable of enslaving or destroying all of Hyrule. Say that, BECAUSE of Link's intervention, Hyrule was flooded and the citizens made it to the mountains to create the kingdom we knew in Wind Waker. Or say that Hyrule was already being flooded. Perhaps Link was the reason that people were able to escape and migrate. Any number of plot devices could place Link as the victor, because, Hyrule's flood is what ultimately foiled his plans. This would also explain the idea that a hero ""never appeared, and a victory well won.

I could add more to this list, in all likelihood, Nintendo would never do, but it's fun to discuss nonetheless.

This was continued somewhat in OoT, or finding every bottle (cause you can never have enough faeries am I right?) but digging every patch of grass, or bombing every wall on a game like OoT would be nigh on impossible, let alone, TP or SS, and I think it's lost something with the advent of a more open world mechanic. 

It goes even deeper when you realise that some of your true ""a ha!"" moments

I feel it's these little things that made the earlier games great. TP never seemed to re-use new items in older dungeons, there didn't seem to be much in OoT, although I may be wrong. Maybe it's just a mechanic of a bygone era, used to extend the game life of a limited cartridge. But maybe it's also a mechanic of getting the player to connect with the landscape, the towns and characters.    

Take for instance Skyrim. It's an open world to an extent, no reward for the hard work I put in.

And so it's things like noticing that those longer patches of grass form an X, and being rewarded for it, that makes the games so fun. I used my brain. I wasn't spoon fed clues. I was informed of the game mechanics and left to find the treasure on my own.

We have here a good game, overall technical aspects of the game are good. The sword mechanic (central focus of the game) is great. But there's something missing, something unquatifiable, a certain ""magic"" present in other Zeldas and many Nintendo games. In short, every aspect of the game feels like the developers were filling a template. ""Let's put enemies in this part, a heart piece there and boss must be beaten with the tool you have just found, cus it's the way bosses in Zelda are.""

This means that there were no further purpose than ""making a Zelda game"" so they made a game with all the  characteristics of Zelda games, without actually caring about the game.

Examples of this:

* Short
* Useless artifacts (just a few are somewhat useful)
* Unimaginative bosses with boring desings (specially the one you fight at the ship
* None of the characters inspire anything (The mini love story also feels like they were doing it by requeriment and Zelda just lacked personality)
* The game gives no motivation to keep going (""Save Zelda"" From what? She's fine. ""Fulfill your destiny"")
* Your actions make no sense. Everything you were asked to do it's just because the goddess wanted and designed a quest with an unnecessarily ammount of tasks.

Zant twitches his neck first, Zant was the one that brought the Twilight realm to Hyrule, and the one that brought Ganondorf back his body. After all, the reason that Ganondorf couldn't just re-enter Hyrule in the first place is because he was locked in the Twilight realm. Looks to me that Zant's expansion of his own dominion allowed Ganondorf to enter Hyrule, and that at the end Zant sort of evacuated Ganon's soul before he died, which would allow for Ganondorf to return again, possibly in Zelda U [(Only Rummors)](http://www.zeldainformer.com/news/rumor-zelda-u-a-sequel-to-twilight-princes#comment-980944475).

Notice also, causing his eyes to roll up into his head?

Finally, then he will always resurrect Zant](http://youtu.be/rqUCO0LN_Fk?t=42s). Between that point and when Ganondorf is defeated, Ganondorf has had ample opportunity to resurrect Zant. Perhaps their souls are bound together now, and that is potentially what gives Zant the ability to evacuate Ganondorf's soul.

**Edit:** Basically my observation and theory is this:

* Link Kills Zant
* Ganondorf revives Zant off-screen (Theory)
* Link returns to Hyrule and challenges Ganondorf
* Link kills Ganondorf
* Just before Ganondorf dies
* Midna leaves
* Ganondorf prepares to return with Zant soon (Theory)

I'm just excited about the possibility.

**Edit 2:** To clarify

1. Ganondorf was what kept Zant alive. His death kills Zant.
1. Ganondorf was about to die, uses some kind of neck twitch magic to finish off Ganondorf.
1. Zant saw that his master was about to die

Years pass, but it splits into its three components, imbuing Ganondorf with Power, Zelda with Wisdom, and Link with Courage.

Emboldened, Link is defeated. Ganondorf claims the last two pieces of the Triforce, transforming into the Demon King Ganon. The ancient sages (not the ones from OoT, possibly those seen in Twilight Princess) seal Ganon away in the Sacred Realm, temporarily defeating him.

However, Zelda desperately thinks of a plan to make things right. By her divine power, she prays for the entire crisis to be averted, to have Ganondorf punished before he can rise to power. Unfortunately, she is unable to change her own timeline, but her prayers are indeed answered.

In the social sciences we have a concept called ""agency.""  Wikipedia defines it as the ability of an individual to act independently and on their own free will.  In WW (or, you could argue that each Link chose to be good (although the fact that the Links are reincarnations/variations on the same ""heroic spirit"" means you could argue otherwise - that he never has a choice and by his very nature is forced to be ""good"" every time).

1360640589.0,18ctiw,A thought for an original story line.  Suggestions please.,one_cool_potata,34,10,36,"Okay so here is my idea (bear with me

Link is traveling (in what time line or after what game I am not sure yet) and comes to a mountain pass.  While venturing through the mountain pass he comes upon a cave to rest.  Once inside though he finds a group of 6 strange beings surrounding a sphere.  They look extremely strange and alien to Link although he has seen many of the inhabitants of the world in his time.  They had strange glowing, water, trees, plants, etc., into the sphere.  They explain that they were working on the sphere to create a way to preserve life in the event Ganondorf were to return and destroy more civilizations.  As the store goes on, they show a darkness that is spreading through the sphere and explain that they need Link’s help to remove it but not to listen to it as it will lie and try to deceive Link.  Link, offers his help

After the dialog they use their magic to shrink link into the sphere where he emerges in a temple with only an exit ahead.  Upon entering the outside world he is allowed to explore the area (that is accessible at the time) and speak with the inhabitants.  Some will mention everyday chatter while others will talk about the “gods”.  Those that speak about the gods will talk about how they revere them and how they give and take but most will be very vague

After completing all the temples Link can finally try to fight Linru in the final temple that was the same one that he began his time in Sphaera in.  Again Linru tries to explain more about the atrocities of the Hurients.  The Hurients kidnapped the people of different tribes of the world and forced them into the sphere.  The Hurients removed any memory they had and were led to believe that they have always lived in the sphere. He also explains that the whole time that Link was working through the dungeons he was working on a way to bring the Hurients into the sphere (Linru can be encountered in several of the temples).  Link tries to commence the fight but Linru backs off and using magic that he attained from various places he brings the 7 Hurients to the temple.

This is where things get interesting for a Zelda game.

Link can choose to side with Linru or the Hurients.  If he chooses to side with Linru they will fight the Hurients together but inevitably Linru will be defeated (not killed) trying to defend Link.  If he chooses to side with Hurients Link will fight Linru and upon his defeat (not death) the Hurients will turn on Link explaining that they cannot let others know of their “project”.  Once the Hurients are defeated in either event, explains even more.  He says that the people of the Sphaera should stay.  Coming out would be a shock to them all and would most likely make things worse.  Also all the torment that Hurients caused will be no more.  He goes on to talk about how they will be fine, they never needed the Hurients to sustain life and that they will be better off.  Linru passes and Link looks at the Sphaera one last time before leaving.  The final scene is of Link leaving the cave and sealing it.

Obviously there are many things to add such as dungeon styles

Bokoblins are the most common enemy in the game and besides bosses and mini-boss enemies (like stalfos) are the only enemies that showcase Skyward Sword's sword-dueling combat.

But the problem isn't the controls being unresponsive. It's that there's a design flaw in bokoblins. Quite frankly it's impossible to maneuver around their defenses under normal circumstances, so you want to swing from the left to hit their right sides but either you accidentally swing from the right and get blocked when you try to set up your attack or you slowly move your arm into position and automatically prepared to block from the other side now. Here's what makes it worse:

This does not happen when you fight Ghirahim! He gives you ample time to position your sword and strike him from the side that he isn't blocking. I've tested it over and over

The reason I had no problems with this is because I figured out how to kill them easily and I never bothered getting upset over fighting them ""correctly."" How do you kill them easily? You waggle the controller so that Link attacks from several directions much faster than you would be capable of. A few strikes will be blocked but one will connect and  leave the bokoblin open for several strikes. This is really annoying of course because it was something that was SPECIFICALLY promised that you wouldn't be doing. Every single preview I read said ""you won't be waggling the controller like in Twilight Princess."" But that is exactly what you have to do. I can definitely see why this is a problem and why people would be angry over this but frankly I don't care. I figured out what to do

If you're curious then how to fight Technoblins

I actually did find a way to fight bokoblins that was much more similar to the ""correct"" way that we were promised we would be able to. Hold your arm to the right as described before so that the bokoblin blocks his left side

1375157901.0,1jbta2,Zelda 2: The Adventure of Link and its explicit connection to the 7 Catholic Sacraments,mpanzer1,41,19,13,"Often regarded as the “red-headed step child” of The Legend of Zelda video game franchise, more Zelda games came.  A Link to the Past was great, like many of my friends

Many years later, I felt a tremendous sense of accomplishment.  Open chapter from my childhood thankfully slammed shut.  These days, many years after those undergraduate years, I’ve had the chance to revisit all the Zelda games of my youth through the Wii.  As a father, I’ve had the chance to open my son’s eyes to the wonder that is the world of Hyrule, Hylia, etc.  

But it is here and now, Zelda 2 is actually a brilliantly crafted metaphor for the spiritual journey of a Roman-Catholic, replete with all 7 sacraments.  In the same vein as Pilgrim’s Progress, the game’s narrative and actions follow the symbolic journey of a hero through all of life’s travails.  It is ultimately the iconography and symbolism embedded in the game that reveals it to be an intentional parallel to the reception of the Catholic sacraments.

This is not as far-fetched as it seems.   Christianity was the intended religion for The Legend of Zelda series and some items, in spite of the effort to de-Christianize the game, that the game itself stands as one of the most creative and imaginative expressions of the Sacraments and of a Catholic’s spiritual journey through the experience of the Sacraments.  To alter that truth would have been an impossible task without redesigning the entire game.  The entire journey itself is the parallel, not just minor moments or items.  Let me explain.

Link begins his journey in the North Palace, “grinding” early on in the game.  Also, both Rauru and Parapa Palace are incredibly close to the North Palace starting point so it doesn’t take too long to start on the game’s journey.  What sacrament would this be then?  Well, for Catholics, Baptism comes first.  And Baptism comes early.  Traditionally, it is early on in a person’s life when he/she is baptized into the faith.  Also, it is incredibly difficult, the candle.  Back to the sacrament, he is lost.

Leaving Parapa Palace, respectively.  Next, he readies himself for Midoro Palace.  This palace, situated in a swamp, requires Link to travel slowly towards it.  There are a few landings of respite on the way, but he must traverse the swamp step by laborious step.  The second sacrament, Reconciliation, not rushed into.  As to the item in the palace, the pathway to a cleansed soul is opened just as Link’s pathway becomes cleared.

Growing in experience, he must go the town of Mido where he learns the Fairy spell and the Downthrust sword technique, an interesting juxtaposition of the importance of learning when to be small and childlike (as this is helpful at all stages of life) and the amazing capabilities people gain as they grow in strength. Finally, he goes to the Island Palace.  His adventure here will parallel the most frequently practiced sacrament, the receiving of the Eucharist.  Again, it is in the cleverness of the game’s design that reveals this connection.  This is the first palace where Link can really “max out” his stats with the emergence of the Red Iron Knuckle at the palace entrance (strike the statue, defeat the knight, just as every week

Before he reaches the Maze Palace, an extension of Link’s growing power, and Reflect, which serves as a connection to his growing intellect.  Geographically, Link must travel farther than he has ever had to get to a palace.  In fact, the Maze Palace is the easternmost and remotest palace in the game.  Link’s will to get there is truly a Confirmation (sorry, couldn’t resist the pun) of his faith.  The enemy of this palace is not one that Link can defeat with the strength of his sword.  Instead, this palace boss is not so much a physical challenge as he is a spiritual/intellectual one.  Just as a Catholic confirms his faith to his diocese’s bishop by choosing a new name

After his victory in the Maze Palace, there is no other way to get to this palace without walking down the aisle.  Obviously, this is a direct reference to the sacrament of Matrimony.  But the connection does not end there.  The boss of this palace literally wields a ball and chain, which is of course a reference to the somewhat derogatory name for a spouse, “the old ball and chain”.  Link of course defeats this boss just a true marriage of hearts and minds defeats the notion of one’s spouse as “an old ball and chain”.  Also, Link must find the whistle in the Palace on the Sea, which serves as the instrument to the final stage of his journey.

Literally, music, calling…this action screams of Holy Orders.  The final crystal palace is the Hidden Palace (or Three Eye Palace), but before Link can get to it he must find the Magic Key as there is not a sufficient amount of ordinary keys to successfully complete the Hidden Palace.  Something that goes beyond the ordinary.  The calling.  Again, Holy Orders.  Link finds the town of New Kasuto and finds the Magic Key.  Next, he must use his whistle-calling at Three Eye Rock or Triangle Rock (Father, Son, which allows him to see the hidden and know the Truth.  I assume there is no need for great explanation here, Thunder.

Lastly, the Great Palace is a twisting maze of confusion and sometimes despair.  Through great effort, Link finds the final boss, Thunderbird, and uses the Thunder spell, thus forcing this demon to reveal his true colors.  It is only trusting in the power from above that Link is able to defeat this challenging boss.  But, in the last great twist of the game’s design, or at least the darkness that is a part of Link’s

After defeating Thunderbird, and to dust you shall return”) and must fight “Dark Link” in order to be truly victorious.  This conflict is fitting and apropos of the game’s overarching metaphor.  What is essence of Catholic faith if not the ability of the soul to know and to fight off and reject the sinful self?  Ultimately, all the sacraments are the vessels we use to fight against our own sinful natures.  After Last Rites, what remains?  The judgment.  Has a man done enough good to overcome his own dark, sinful nature?  Can he enter into Paradise?  In the ultimate expression of the power of Christ’s redemption, Link overcomes his dark self.  He’s earned his Triforce.

I believe it is hands down Skyward Sword Link that is the ""Best"". 

Let's take a look at what he did exactly.

 Edit- I'm leaving my original post below what I'm about to post

* Even though he was the chosen hero by the goddess, they just kind of... got them. (TP Link trained, WW Link trained a little bit.)

* Probably the most obvious, legendary sword in existence for himself and any who comes after him to use.

* He defeated Demise in his most powerful form. In a form so powerful not even the Goddess was able to defeat him. Every Link after him fought a very weakened version of Demise. Sure, let me ask you this: Why does Ganondorf REQUIRE the Triforce to take Hyrule? Demise didn't need it, he just wanted it.

* He saved three of the most important minor deities- Water Dragon, a lot of things would be different.

* He is the ONLY Link to be chosen by all three pieces of the Triforce. Some of the other Links obtained the Triforce

* He single handedly ran through a land uninhabited by human life, and eventually for the humans.

* Despite being the ""Chosen hero"" he had to prove himself worthy of the Master Sword

Objectively-To look at something while not influenced by personal feelings or opinions

Everything below the line is my original post
______________________________________________________________________________________________


 
 *  First off, he became a hero.  He was not given skills from the get go, he obtained those skills.  He didn't have the Triforce and it's powers, he had himself, a blessed sword, and an annoying robot.


* I feel this one is the most obvious, legendary sword in existence for himself and any who comes after him to use.**  


* He defeated Demise in his most powerful form, at not nearly the same level of power.  I'm not denying that Ganon is powerful, but comparatively, he's like an angry kitten.  He also sealed Demise a total of 4 times when he was the imprisoned.

* He saved three of the four minor deities in the land.  We can't know what would happen if one of them had died

* He got the TRIFORCE.  He did not just get a piece of the triforce

---
**The Creation of the World**

In the beginning, Din, Nayru, and Farore (aka ""The Golden Goddesses), came up with a plan to deal with the demonic forces causing chaos in the cosmos. In an attempt to bind the evil forces and seal them away forever, these three deities created a new place to serve as their prison.

Din, all the greater and lesser demons of the universe were cast, including beings such as Demise, Malladus, and possibly Majora. Nayru, the goddess of wisdom, created the law and order of the world (i.e. gravity, oceans, created the plants

When it came time for the Golden Goddesses to leave this new world, Hylia, as an overseer of this world, protecting both the Triforce and the people in their new environment.

---
**The Origin of Evil**

Now we see numerous references in the series that the evil forces are bound within the earth or otherwise originate from the earth:

Demise is referred to as ""The Imprisoned"" and at the start of *Skyward Sword* is bound underneath the original site of the Goddess Statue sealed below the earth with a physical spike. The story states that in the beginning, Demise took control over the other demons within the ""Evil Realm"" by default or by dominating them through force and strength. Since Demise is the first recorded Demon King in the history of Zelda to appear and is also described as ""the source of all monsters"", one could also conclude that (1) he was the strongest of all the demons in order to breach the surface first and (2) that because of his first escape, he lead other lesser demons to populate the world above and remain scattered.

Likewise, such as (1) if time had passed after Demise was sealed into the Master Sword and Malladus is the next most-powerful demon to assume the title or (2) if the evil forces within the Evil Realm are spread apart into different sub-groups following different leaders. The backstory to *Spirit Tracks* shows that extra bindings were required to suppress the power of Malladus in the form of the Spirit Tracks.

Could other evil beings have originated from within this prison under the earth known as the Evil Realm

If the world is their prison and the Triforce is the key to the prison

---
**One-World Zelda**

Now my theory also suggests that this world that the Golden Goddesses created is the same world that all the different lands featured in the series are a part of. See the image below for a depiction of my multi-part theory. 

To fully contain the evil within this void in the universe, is actually a spherical planet. This theory could explain a number of things in the series:

* How many of the same races seen in Hyrule are seen in other lands such as Termina
* How Link travelled to Termina partially through the use of falling down a deep chasm
* How certain objects called Moon's Tears are seen in different lands in the series

1374623741.0,1ix5nm,My friend asked me why I didn't like Skyward Sword... I ended up ranting up a skype message for like 10 min. What do you guys think of Skyward Sword? I'd like to here the dissenting opinion,OzkanTheFlip,53,34,69,"here's my long ass skype message:

The world is SMALL. Despite being hyped as the biggest world yet it’s probably the smallest. There is one town in the whole fucking game. The sky doesn’t take long to explore and what’s with EVERY SINGLE “secret” in a chest somewhere in the sky marked on your map. The land beneath the sky is small too! Three areas, maybe 20 and they’re almost all in the same town. The extra stuff for you to do is also lame and located in this small town… Zelda’s suppose to have vast lands to explore and new places to go, people to meet. Skyward Sword has four places to go and you go there in a repetitive order. There’s no exploration at all, fairy fountains, hidden caves, etc. The other games were much more open world then this one.

Fi… MUTHA FUCKIN FI!!! She can go kill herself. Take Navi

Controls are bad, if it’s not 1:1 it’s BAD. Twilight princess did it right, a swing was just another button pressed in an awesome way. Not only the sword movement but somehow the pointing was screwed up too, I never had trouble pointing at shit in Twilight Princess. And you know what makes bad controls even worse? THE GAMES FUCKING BASED OFF THESE CONTROLLS!!!! It makes it boring; almost every enemy, including the bosses are defeated by swinging in a certain direction (even though mad flailing of the arm can kill most of them anyway) and many puzzles are this too…DULL.

I find the story dull and the “epic” quest involving to many tedious tasks like collecting and backtracking through this small world. The world is too static and unchanging. In past games you could change the environment in cool ways such as change time, herpderpderp!” WHOOPDIE FUCKIN DOO! All it does is give a tiny mini game to open a series of places it tells you to open. The puzzles you face throughout the story just seem uncreative, part of this due to it almost all being based off Wii Motion Plus as I said before. RIP Day/Night Cycle. Another cause of this horribly static world is that it’s day all the fucking time. Oh wait you can sleep and make it night! OH WAIT! YOU CAN ONLY DO IT IN SKYLOFT, CAN’T LEAVE SKYLOFT AND THERE’S NOTHING TO DO!!!!!! Time just stands still, it’s just bad. 

Time for just my preferences! I’m just going to list shit I didn’t like. I don’t like the inventory setup. It’s way to difficult to drink a potion in this game and I don’t like not being able to use all my items whenever I want. I also just don’t like how the game doesn’t pause anymore when you go to the item menu. I’m also not a fan of the art, Skyward Sword seems to just do it worse because it can’t quite get the full affect from each art style. I didn’t like how they arranged the story; it never had the clean-cut concept of stopping evil. I don’t like the stamina meter, it doesn’t need to be there. WHERE ARE THE FUCKING FAIRES AND MAGIC… for real though, no fountains, magic, nothing. Also where’s the castle? Some one tell me WHERE THE FUCKING CASTLES HIDING!! IT’S A ZELDA GAME GODDAMNIT GIVE ME A CASTLE!!! Nothing seemed super evil and dark to me. It’s like I’m playing a Disney movie. I think there’s a lack of interesting items and uses for said items, I also just don’t like the upgrade system or the durability shield. 

I’m sure I could think of some other things but you’re not worth it *censored friend's name*.

Let's take a moment to despell any plot holes. Near the end of the game, so it's obvious that you got to do some time travel. But here's where things get interesting. Talk to Groose before you plant the seed. He admires the spot and recognizes that the tree is not there. After planting the tree in the past, it appears in the present. Groose then comments on how gorgeous it is. See, he did not say that it magically appeared. *The present you knew was altered because you changed the past*. You learned through implication that the tree has always been there. Remember this for the ending.

At the end, but rather, that it has always been there. Your job was to restore it and put it there after taking care of this and that bad guy.

So are the Goddess Sword and Master Sword different blades altogether? They are the same. It's implied that the blade loses it's power and seal somehow

But hasn't the Master Sword always been there if the tree has always been there? It's there in the pedestal in the present! It shouldn't be there! You changed the present by leaving it in the past! This would mean that they are different blades and Nintendo is stupid right? Not necessarily! The time portal is closed at a certain point in the past and must be reopened in the future. There is only one timeline that can replay itself indefinitely. The blade is there in the present because you do not hold it anymore. At this point

I know it's not usually in their nature to make games that are chronologically right after each other, but it's never been confirmed, obviously. The fact that they are using the same art style, and how SS ended, could be a hint that it is, though.)

* The Great Betrayal (of the Sheikah, and then were sealed by the 3 Light Spirits (once the great dragons) into the twilight realm by command of the Golden Goddesses.
* Establishment of the sages? The Sage of Light Raaru places the triforce back in the sacred realm
* Hyrule Kingdom Establishment
* It's a time skip to after Minish cap, or something. 

**Other more random ideas:** 

* An end to one of the ""Hero is Successful"" timelines, asking them not to leave behind the triforce, but instead watch over the land because of how much war and evil it's attracted. This is just a random idea I had for a Zelda game.
* I haven't finished the Oracle games, but if not, they should have a game explaining. (Let me know if they do, but don't actually explain it.)

The game takes place During Ocarina of Time, but trying to accomplish something else. (And they'd probably be redesigned for gameplay's sake) For example, you'd curse the Deku Tree, Fill Dodongo's Cavern with monsters and block the entrance, and do whatever to Jabu Jabu to make him wanna eat Ruto.

We'd learn about the plight of the Gerudos and how the Kingdom of Hyrule didn't aid them as much as they needed. You could have a whole racism thing going on there. Couple that with Demise's presence turning Ganondorf more and more evil and we have a character piece.

We could get his side of the story and see him go from Ambassador of the Gerudos to Power Hungry Maniac. Maybe he wants equality for all area of Hyrule

I'm also thinking at first he doesn't mean to be evil. I'm thinking he never had an aptitude for magic until Demise starts to take over and some of his initial curses are just Ganondorf showing weakness and submitting to the dark magic. HENCE why he craves POWER...just thought of that

The flashbacks could also cover things like his surrogate moms

Anywho

Occasionally you'll have some run ins with a mysterious ninja guy. You also create Phantom Ganon, release Bongo Bongo, and meet up with your surrogate mothers back in your homeland. At this point, you've taken over Hyrule, so you wait.

Some more backstory, and the possible love interest, whatever.

Fast forward to you capturing Zelda and playing the organ for a while. Link comes and you have a climactic battle. I think it would be a bit different from the actual OoT battle because of how I envision the gameplay (More on that thought later). Anyway you have a sword fight or something and Link wins.

You so desperately want to see equality in the world, it seems. In his moment of pure weakness and anger, he lets himself get completely consumed by the darkness that Demise has been granting him and becomes the beast Ganon. You have the fight against Link as the beast.

Now
In the other two timelines, and we never see him again until he breaks out of his 'prison' and then gets legit killed and then we actually never see him again.

I think gameplay would be very similar to the main series. The puzzles could be the same type of thing

**===Whole plot summary follows===**

Before the events of Skyward Sword, a knight of Hyrule, and a powerful hero, was imprisoned by his own people over a misunderstanding for over four years. The people then released Link, pleading with him to save Hyrule when the Demon King's arrival was imminent. Grinning, he points out how *convenient* it is that he be released when the people need a hero. However, his bitterness is only superficial: ""My dear land of Hylia! Though people's hearts may change with time, pride

Through the next several pages, an event which causes the Triforce symbol to appear on the Master Sword, a blessing of the Three Dragons. With the help of Hylia, Castle Hyrule was split from the land, and the Master Sword became a ""pillar between heaven and earth, guided by the loftwing, rising to the heavens."" Link, succumbed to his wounds

The Goddess Hylia then reveals that Link's imprisonment was necessary to shape him into the hero they all needed, heroic spirit will live on eternally. And I...I shall shed my divinity. The next time we meet, I wish to stand before you as a simple human. Whenever the land of Hylia is in danger...we shall be reborn...""

===End summary===

There are obvious conclusions to draw from this:

* Link, and the Link of Skyward Sword is the *first reincarnation*. All the Links in the games are reincarnations of the Hero of Hyrule.

* Link's ascension to hero status was preordained by the gods

* Link's mysterious connection to the powerful red loftwing is a relic of his predecessor's bond with it.

* The red loftwing is a beast from the heavens

* The Demon King, he did not die, but was instead sealed away. In the events of Skyward Sword, Link killed him for good, though his hatred will take form through an endless cycle of reincarnation.

There are still a few mysteries

* ~~The Master Sword was borne to Hyrule by the Goddess Hylia, Ocarina of Time), in no game was it required to *break the sword and reforge it*. Perhaps such a drastic measure was necessary to tie the Master Sword to Hyrule?~~ Edit: The manga states that the Master Sword was created by the gods for their use, but must be reforged by humans to exert its power on the surface.

* Edit: Why did the Master Sword become the Goddess Sword? In every other game

* How important are the Three Dragons to the Triforce and Hylian mythology? As I understood, guarded the melody which would awaken the Master Sword. But while they have obvious connections with the Goddesses Din, Nayru and Farore, who created Hyrule and the Triforce, the Dragons were not guardians of the Triforce, which remained hidden in the caverns of Skyloft. Is their disappearance from other games due to their gradual loss of relevance, especially once Hyrule returns to the surface?",False,,http://www.reddit.com/r/truezelda/comments/17ne5g/spoilers_xpost_bonus_manga_in_hyrule_historia/

These are the words Demise utters when you defeat him in Skyward Sword. Now

It seems like it's the other way around. Ganon was born first and later Zelda and Link are born since the world now ""needs"" them to defeat this evil.

[**The official timeline for reference**](http://www.zeldadungeon.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Hyrule-Historia-Timeline-translated-Graphics.jpg)

**Lets Begin With [Labrynna](http://zeldawiki.org/Labrynna):**

If you don't know about Labrynna, with a town in the center where a giant tower is being built to touch the heavens, a mountain to the North East, a large southern and South Eastern coast, and a strange balancing mountain in the North West](http://www.zeldauniverse.net/wp-content/uploads/2007/08/OoA-Labrynna-Past.png). The balancing mountain in the North West is a strange concept, so let me explain. It is like a giant platform balancing on the top of a mountaintop, and is threatening to topple over at any moment. The people even mirror each others’ lives, so that the land doesn’t tip in either direction.

**Labrynna in the Distant Future:**

Scouring the Zelda 2 map, a possible bleak future for Labrynna was painted. Now remember that this paper is a theory based in established game lore, so take it with an extra grain of salt.

To see what I saw, and the Island Palace, as well as the land just beyond the mountains to the North West. The land geography is the same as that of Labrynna. *If this is where Labrynna used to be*, then the future of Labrynna is to become a giant desert, *filled* with graves of the dead. In the center, where the tower should be, we see the King's Tomb, then what happened to it?

Imagine if the balancing land in the North West mountains were to collapse. What would happen? The impact of such a massive object would cause a giant earth quake, Hyrule kingdom, off of the map! And perhaps in the Downfall Era [Rauru wasn't there to protect the world from the flood waters, like he did when the goddesses flooded Hyrule in the Adult Era](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Legend_of_Zelda:_The_Wind_Waker). After all, the presence of the Kings Tomb in Zelda 2 confirms that Rauru was already dead by that time at least. It is assumed that Ganon killed him in the original Zelda game when he captured Zelda. But that is not confirmed.

This would explain the barren wasteland of Hyrule that we see in the original Legend of Zelda

**The Mountain Collapse

In the Adult era, and 1000 years passed since then. When taken at face value, it appears that the legend in WW of the flood happened relatively soon after OoT. But when considered again, you may note that it never says how long it took Ganon to return the second time. Perhaps, the same amount of time passed between OoT, and the legend at the beginning of WW as passed between OoT and the moment that the mountain *potentially* collapsed in Labrynna. 

To clarify what that would imply: the same mountain collapsing caused the barren Hyrule in the original game, because it is held up by the bubble. Now I’m not saying that the Goddesses didn’t cause the flood. But this could be the Goddesses’ method for flooding Hyrule, and would make sense to have happened in the Adult Era as well as the Downfall Era, considering Ganon’s presence in each.

Not only does the mountain collapse conveniently fit well into its own timeline

Then, where is Labrynna in the Adult Era?

**Labrynna in the Adult Era:**

In WW, and make a new land, the people in WW move on across the sea. In Phantom Hourglass we see that the people from the WW world sail away to explore new lands, and rebuild their ancient Kingdom, but they hit a bit of a snag in the form of the Ghost Ship. After Link solves that problem, the people of that era move on again, and find a great new land.

When the water flooded Hyrule, however, we see that it greatly resembles [the map of Labrynna]( http://www.zeldauniverse.net/wp-content/uploads/2007/08/OoA-Labrynna-Past.png), and that same section on [the Zelda 2 map](http://i290.photobucket.com/albums/ll248/BEASTMASTERTOAD/Hyrule_AoL_1.gif)! All of the same locations match up, except for the area in the North West, which is now a snowy region. Could that be the ancient ruins of the balancing mountain that caused the floods? Could the tower in Labrynna, the King’s Tomb

I believe the three splits from OoT already represent each of the series' lead characters: - Ganondorf wins = LTTP

Thus the idea of the three splits being different 'parts' of the triforce could also align with each characters' timeline/their piece of the triforce (power
And why not have an ultimate ending link who joins it all back again? Doesn't mean Nintendo can't put more games between all the gaps- and it would place more value on the events of OoT and its timeline splitting. I.e the events of OoT are so epic

This corruption of space and time also nicely accounts for all the different ways time behaves across different Zelda games (I.e majora's mask being a loop, that was the beginning of time and space getting fucked up in the universe of Zelda and thus from that point Hyrule was doomed to eventually live out the events of OoT (history repeating itself because time is trying to be linear but link keeps resetting Ganon's attempts of domination) and thus in this theoretical game you are being the ultimate Link who undoes all of the universe warping started all tet time before?

And then, the ultimate God/father of time and since he's 'fixing' the universe, he 'creates' the universe and the end of this game reveals to be just before Demise's original attacks on the earth. Link gets lazy, Hylia has to step in and it eventually leads to the semi-wasteland of skyward sword, with lanaryu being reminenents of God Link's world... Thus all of the timeline forms a super symbolic loop of events - which also explains why some od the imagery is consistent throughout the games

So, Link could jump between the parallel realities created by the timeline splits in OoT.  This would create a really cool way to have mirrored worlds without revisiting the Light/Dark world and/or time traveling.  Just like the Light/Dark world, events in each parallel reality would affect each other.  This could create for some really cool puzzles like the water temple in ALttP.  This game could either come before WW, TP, and ALttP (which would make Hyrule in all three realities a very similar place), or it could come at the end of all three timelines (thus Hyrule would be dramatically different in each reality) and be a story of how Link ""reintegrates"" the parallel dimensions into a single reality.

After I thought of this idea for a game, Ganondorf never actually touches the Triforce, thus it should still be resting in the Sacred Realm.  However, for some reason, in TP Link, Zelda, and Ganondorf all have the Triforce marks on their hands, not being killed easily; being able to transform into Ganon).

My problem is that Link (and perhaps the Happy Mask Salesman) seem to break the rules here. Link somehow manages to travel between the two universes, seem to exist in both simultaneously (assuming everyone didn't collectively bail on Hyrule).

Background: I grew up with Zelda and my brother and I played a lot of the games

Grown up now

So

Write a full length novel regarding the background story of Bongo Bongo and his tragedy and rise.

This will be similar to what ""The Protomen"" did with the Mega Man story. Link: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Protomen  

I know at some point there will be conflicting theories


The man who could see the truth will be named ""Gabora"" (Tribute to Majora's Mask) and will eventually become Bongo Bongo

(reference http://zelda.wikia.com/wiki/Zubora_and_Gabora) 

Dampe, and Grog will be featured as children. A major plot point will explain why Grog grows to hate his parents 

The fabulously rich family will be a major role and mostly an antagonist. 
(a love interest with a family member will be the cause of most of the problems between Gabora and the family)

A class structure will make Sheikah's (who control the town) higher ranking than normal people. Gabora will be forbidden from ""seeing the truth"" due to his non-heritage (source for a lot of conflict)

Impa will be involved more and more as the story progresses until her conflict with Gabora becomes clear. 

Other OOT references will be made

Ganondorf will not be featured. I am taking the path that Bongo Bongo came to power on his own and was sealed away by Impa. His release when Ganondorf comes to power is beyond the scope of the books time frame. 

(Suggestions welcome). 


HELP WANTED:
I have read a lot of articles on the two zelda wikis and they proved to be extremely useful in filling in the gaps. 

But my story lacks research in some fields. 

The civil war is mentioned in a lot of the games so I would like your input on what parts may be important or essential to Kakariko Village or the theories regarding the purpose of the shadow temple. 

Any information on the symbolism seen inside the shadow temple and the Sheikah's. The lens of truth will play a major role in how Gabora learns to ""see the truth"". 

Names for family members of the ""Fabulously Rich Family"". Since there are none and I can't come up with any that sound realistic for a zelda game. I need a father

Some kind of explanation for Dampe. (origins

And the most important
I don't know the dates of the civil war or when the Sheikahs owned the village.

So far...
Gabora is 17
Impa 17
Guru-Guru 8
Dampe 13
Shikashi 40
Anju 8
Grog 7 
Mutoh 21
Granny 53   

This novel will take time to compile the research but once the entire plot is set in stone (lol)

To start with

For those who don't know, not necessarily a box.

The equipment would represent real life equipment such as AC/DC source, diodes, wires etc. Maybe not wires but something very similar like moving tiles to carry the current.

Now in every room there is an x amount of boxes followed by wires/tiles to connect to the box. This puzzle would be very simple

The next few rooms could deal with resistors (objects you can pick up and drop), or enemies spawn etc. 

Moving on the puzzles get harder such as using transformers. Instead of getting the right current to x boxes

The dungeon gets more complicated now as diodes (place able and rotatable objects) are taken into account. A diode lets current pass from one side but not the other. 

Then comes relays and contacts. There are 2 contacts, the contacts reverse their state. For example a NC becomes a NO when the relay is energized. To make things harder some rooms require a seal-in contact. These contacts are the same except they stay in their new state even when the relay has been de-energized.

1358166460.0,16jqot,Yet another Majora's Mask theory.,woodaba2,28,13,36,"Having just finished my playthrough of Majora's Mask, if you will.

A little explanation is required for this one. So, contains THE definitive timeline to the Zelda series, the holy grail of utterly pointless video game factoids since the dawn of time.

The timeline confirms the existence of what many fans had speculated since Ocarina of Time: that the timeline split at the end of Ocarina of Time. In one timeline, leading to A Link to the Past. However, the other split is far more interesting. After defeating Ganon at the end of Ocarina, Zelda send Link back to his childhood to live the childhood he missed. This created two timelines, one for Zelda in the future after Ganon is overthrown, and one where Link and Zelda stop Ganondorf from taking over in the first place. Ignoring the insane amount of paradoxes that would inevitably erupt from this, we have confirmation that travelling back in time does create parallel timelines.

What does this have to do with Majora? Well

Every single time Link uses the Song of Time to travel back to the start of the 3 days, you are, inadvertently, causing the deaths of thousands, possible millions, because Termina is kinda abstract and it's hard to tell just how many people actually live there.

But wait! It gets better!

With this knowledge in hand, won't use the song of time"". But, here's the thing: you already do. In the first cycle, you have no choice but to use the Song of Time and abandon Termina to it's fate. And even then, it is basically impossible to go through the rest of the game without using the Song of Time a few times, so inevitably, more and more terminas, are gonna die.

But wait! It gets better!

How many times have you reversed the clock in order to do a side-quest? How many times have you used the song of time in order to do things that have nothing to do with your quest to save the world, just to fix the problems of a tiny handful of people, only so that they die in a day or two anyway. Sure, you could use the reverse song of time to give yourself more time, but you're still delaying the inevitable. That moon's gonna fall. And there's only one way to stop it. It may seem cruel, but if you want to save as many people as possible, if you want the least amount of Terminas to die, after all.

But wait! It gets better!

Given all this knowledge

It is better, if you do play it, you're just condemning more people to their fate. If you seek to preserve life, then playing the song of time is the worst thing you can do. It is arguably better, in the long run, for Link to wait for death atop the Clock Tower. If Link himself realizes this, there are only really two motivations Link can have for continuing on his quest:

1) Having a compulsive need to find one saved Termina atop the pile of countless dead

or

2) Purely selfishly: Link wants to find the one timeline where he himself can survive.

And then, this could very well be Canonical, aside from maybe the last point, because that's just my interjection on the situation. Still though, I wonder if Nintendo knew just how horrifying the levels of Fridge Horror the Zelda timeline has created.

1362980802.0,1a2gde,"On Hyrule's geography and the series as ""legend""...",dahahawgy,14,0,8,"TL;DR at the bottom

So the map overlay post from a couple days ago got me thinking about my position on Hyrule's geography. Personally, but I'd never seen the Wind Waker comparison, which is also awesome. Still, when the maps are just *so similar*, but too different to accurately be called the same, it bothers me on a minor level.

I've heard it posited everywhere that perhaps, but I've never been a fan of that idea; after all, recent games seem to be gearing towards creating a sprawling continuity, and I love that about the series. Helps the world feel more alive, I guess.

So how to reconcile the constantly shifting map with a legit continuity? My take on it is that while the series as a whole is one giant, in the Child Timeline (for example), Ocarina of Time happens, then a ways down the line, Twilight Princess happens. In the ""real"" Hyrule (insofar as there can be a real Hyrule), the geography is entirely consistent between the two stories; whether it matches one or the other or if it's something in between or entirely different doesn't matter. But when these games come out, the way the storyteller (Nintendo) presents Hyrule is entirely up to them.

This also accounts for things like graphical differences (WW takes place in the same timeline as OoT, but the ""true canon"" is more of a broad strokes kind of thing.

For those of you that don't know, Link gets mutated into a Deku Scrub, a small wooden creature. Eventually, Link gets the curse lifted from him. So the Deku Scrub gets trapped trapped inside a mask. Allowing Link to change between his hylian (basically the same concept as human) form and deku scrub form. Throughout the game, Link obtains two more masks transforming him into a Goron, (a rock creature) and a Zora (a fish creature). He also obtains twenty non-transformation masks, most of which are optional to obtain. In the end of the game, he can obtain the Fierce Deity's Mask. 


Fierce Deity, I believe, and most people believe, that Fierce Deity is stronger than Majora. ""He is the true bad guy"" says one of the children on the moon. They're probably right. As when Link finally fights Majora using Fierce Deity's Mask is so easy to defeat Majora. Kijin no Kamen is the Japanese name for Fierce Deity, which translates exactly to Devil God's Mask. This definitely determines that Fierce Deity is a demonic, evil god.

Oni Link (a nickname for Fierce Deity) means many things from Japanese. Oni means a large monster, or blue-gray, with horns, three fingers, three toes, or in certain occasions three eyes. Though I don't know how he got his nickname to be Oni Link, I can support the name. Fierce Deity's clothes is a dark-blue

Theories

One theory suggests that Majora wanted someone to get the mask, Link did not get possessed because he has will-power and has a kind heart. (as he does in every Zelda game.) so Majora did not see this coming and got overwhelmed.

Majora could just be messing with Link, rather than killing him. Or how he makes the moon fall in a short amount of three days, rather than speeding it up or finding a different way to bring doomsday. Or how he basically gave Link Fierce Deity's Mask. This all could be a sense of fair play. But then again, facts can also oppose this. The reason Majora did not turn Link into a deku rather then killing him could be that he did not know he was a threat at the time. So he turned him into a deku scrub for his amusement. The reason he made the moon fall is that he wanted an interesting way to kill everyone, and he couldn't speed it up because he didn't know how. The reason to oppose Fierce Deity's Mask is that he didn't know it existed, or as I said earlier he could've given it to him as a sense of fair play. When you put this theory in perspective however, it seems much more likely for him to be playing games with Link.

Fierce Deity could be Link's Terminan counterpart

In the beginning

Majora could possibly altogether just be simply insane. He could possibly have made the moon fall for his own sick pleasure. Or he could make Link go through everything because Majora is mad. Majora could just give Link the mask because as said earlier

Conclusion


To conclude this, his own kind of Triforce of Power. He is not evil nor good, but he works alone, not for Majora or Ganondorf or anyone. Majora is only a distraction and the real enemy, is Fierce Deity.

-----

To add

I was using the Triforce of Power as an example. I now think that the Triangle on Fierce Deity's armor resembles the triforce and hyrule

In Ocarina, which is incredibly easy to do, considering the flinch mechanic. It feels like they didn't bother adjusting the combat to fit well with all the techniques you learn, and even tweaked it to be blatantly easier. I went into the final battle with 3 bottles of Fairy's Tears/Rare Chu Jelly, and a Fairy. I didn't lose 8 hearts throughout all 3 phases. Also, the secrets weren't that difficult to find. They were usually outlined pretty well throughout the world. I can't say they were the easiest in any Zelda game, though

Dungeons were another thing. Every Dungeon was streamlined and overall simple. I only got stumped maybe 3 times in all the Dungeons, but I'd imagine without help, Ocarina's Dungeons would be rather difficult.

I noticed a similar trend in Minish Cap. Compared to ALttP, etc. Admittedly, Link to the Past wasn't a difficult game to begin with (excluding dungeons), but Minish Cap made it even easier. 

As far as Skyward Sword goes: It was actually rather difficult. However, the biggest player in combat difficulty for it was the occasional unresponsiveness of the controller. Otherwise the biggest player was Fi's handholding.

* first off Oot. This Link, I believe the experience traumatized him somewhat and led him to settling down eventually(I like to think with Malon) after a few(smaller) adventures. He never really got over his experiences though, and maybe some obligations to his family(like working a ranch to provide steady income/helping citizens build new settlements near the forests?) made it impossible for him to turn back into the great hero he was once and so he died with a few regrets.  
* WW Link, a sister that looks up to and cares for him though she may think he was a bit of an idiot, all the other islanders obviously seem to care for him a great deal. All in all, he seems to be the happy-go-lucky type of guy. His adventure however forced him to grow up and mature, to be the kind of person that can reliably hold the world on his shoulders and still smile. New hyrule taking his uniform and turning it into a badge of honor for their knights makes me think that he grew up to be a great hero for the new land.  
* TP Link is one very cocky and show-offy person. He could be the handsome ranch hand that made the village girls swoon in a novella. He
* MC Link, to a blacksmith. He might have a taste for the finer things though, since he's childhood friends with a princess. Seeing as they already have this kind of relationship and the fact that he saved from petrification, I'd see this Link has a likelihood of being a royal consort.

Link is short and chubby in all the 2d games out of necessity. A top down perspective needs to show an interesting character, even in the case of Cel shaded Link, in Phantom Hourglass and Spirit Tracks, Link is a full shaped and sized Toon Link. This did work because they weren't strict top down, but for every 3d Zelda game, link has been true to the game art as to proportion.

So what about this Link? For some reason it bugs me that if he is shown in the game art as the same proportions as old Zelda illustrations, and can see he is quite cherubic.

What about cutscenes? Personally I'm hoping they stick to top down, would be hard to be taken seriously, especially if we saw official game art of him looking properly proportioned or badass.

Now if the Game art does look like this baby-link

The other side feel that if given the right direction

Anyway here are some of the things we as a group listed; I've organised them in order of hell yes to hell no!

**Hell Yes**

* Ezlo as Link's guide. Seriously Navi would make the film suffer. Ezlo is a far more animated character who can bring a lot more to the table than the ""Hey Listen' joke.

* Semi-serious tone

* New storyline, it would open up the film to the public which in turn means that in order to please both the fans and general public the use of zelda quotes etc would have to be well thought out.

* Wardrobe revamp, it literally makes me want to avert my eyes. The costumes for the games work perfectly, but in regards to film they always look out of place. For example that Sonic the hedgehog fan film that came out recently. It was good for a fan film, but Eggman's costume, dear god was it horribly designed. Personally if your taking anything from a game to film, you need to change the attire so that it can fit something that the general public would be comfortable seeing fashionably.  

**Ehh Maybe?**

* Link talking, if we are talking about live action film, having a completely mute character isn't an easy person to cast. You have to be able to find someone who is particularly good at being animated with their body language and facial expression, which isn't that easy. Now I'm not saying have Link be a chatterbox, but talking a bit might be good? 

**Hell no**

* Ganondorf being actually green. If done right it could look good, being black (due to being brought up in a desert like environment (yes I know not everyone is dark skinned when raised in such a place)) Would work better. The red hair would have to become a deeper magenta in order to look better.

* 'Excuse me Princess!' if Link talks he can't say that line, IT WOULD BE SHOWN AS THE TRAILER JOKE NONSTOP. What starts out as a hilarious quip quickly becomes a shut the hell up.

* Being directed by James Cameron
* Or Christopher Nolan

These are just a couple we thought about, or what wouldn't you!

My theory is as follows: When Link pulls out the Master Sword

1) Link is removed from the timeline

2) Link reawakens and returns to Hyrule's timeline seven years in Hyrule's future, has Link in it. He proceeds to do what he does in the game and defeats Ganon, before disappearing into the past, and no longer existing in that timeline (the adult timeline).

3) When Link returns to the past

**_______________________________________________________**



**New Legends**

When Nintendo started working on the next Legend of Zelda game they had only one rule: nothing is holy.
Level has as world first witnessed what the future holds for Nintendo's legendary franchise.
Hope you're all with us.

**_______________________________________________________**

**The Legend of Zelda: Hyrule**

I stand on a mountaintop and look out over Hyrule. On the horizon I see the royal castle. West of the castle I see a vast desert. High above the land float the smoke and ash spit out of Death Mountain. It's close to erupting.

I search my pocket for the compass. The item that previously had a pretty much useless function has become my best friend. I wouldn't survive a day without it in this enormous unforgiving world.

Hyrule is the game where Nintendo literally lets us explain every single corner of the Legend of Zelda universe. Despite the series always having placed the player in a fascinating world, or behind the invisible walls has always been there.

The new game displays the classic world on a completely new scale. All of the series' most iconic places and environments are still there

Hyrule takes place in a kingdom divided by the political interests of the different tribes and races. Humans accuse the Hylians, and in their search for a new place to call home risks turning into an all-out war between them and the zora.

Within the walls of the castle whispers are heard. Whispers of a boy with green clothes and the symbol of the Triforce on the back of his hand. He drove evil back thousands of years ago. Prophecies say the time has come for a new hero to unite Hyrule and save the kingdom from ruin. But so far no hero has emerged.

That is because you are the hero.

The key word in The Legend of Zelda: Hyrule is freedom. You take on the role as a reincarnated Link. You are not only free to play however you want, the bird race from The Wind Waker. But be prepared for your choice of race to affect your story-line as well as how other characters relate to you.

New for the game is also the freedom of taking the dungeons on in any order you desire. From Hyrule's mountaintops you can spot all nine of them, guarding their treasures, and their roars can be heard miles away.

Skeptics usually criticize the recycling of puzzles in The Legend of Zelda

Although you are free to act on your own, which has always been an incredibly important source of water for all of Hyrule.

And regarding the smaller consequences

**_______________________________________________________**

**The New Legend of Zelda**

""Help me.. Please help me.. I am a prisoner in the dungeon of the castle. My name is Zelda.""

Link wakes up. Or he's still dreaming. The only thing he knows for sure is that the voice in his head desperately is pleading for help.

""The wizard

A heavy

""I am in the dungeon of the castle. Please help me..""

Link himself doesn't know whether it's because he wants answers or because he wants to help, black night.

This is one of the most well-known introduction of gaming history

The New Legend of Zelda tells nothing about how the stormy night ends

How did Agahnim seize power in Hyrule? Who is the uncle Link lives with? How was the flute boy's life before being twisted by the powers of the Dark World? All of these questions are answered in The New Legend of Zelda, before A Link to the Past.

Nintendo has used everything they learnt from New Super Mario Bros to bit by bit, though never shallow, Hyrule Link once grew up in. The graphics engine is a revamped HD version of Four Swords Adventures, which allows for an enormous amount of detail but still the ability to zoom out in order to get a better overview of the promised land.

Just like what Zelda II: the Adventure of Link did to the world of the original Legend of Zelda

Another important point to make is that the story never gets more space than what can be told in a handful of text-boxes each containing three lines of text. The reason that the story of say Link's Awakening is so captivating is as simple as it is obvious: it has a basic idea so ingenious you barely have to mention it.

The New Legend of Zelda is a return to the old ways of game design in the same way. The series used to be pretty much an interactive puzzle-book played mainly for problem-solving

Just like New Super Mario Bros, like the controller's built in camera, accelerometer, microphone and gyroscope. Nor is it compatible with the balance board and the right analog stick does absolutely nothing. The only thing shown on the controller's screen is a simple inventory and a map.

Surprisingly though is the presence of online aspects

Today The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past is one of the best games ever made. Maybe the only way to surpass the old masterpiece is to return to a time before it existed.

**_______________________________________________________**

The third idea they had was a game where you play as ganondorf. It would be heavily story-driven and very dark.

The last was basically the first Legend of Zelda turned into co-op with the second player taking on the role of Princess Zelda.

Personally, but similar to the Metroid series, the Zelda series has never *needed* to be strung together. It would make much more sense if Nintendo had originally planned out a series, like how Konami planned there to be multiple Metal Gear Solid games. I don't see why they couldn't have just left each game to be separate, just look at how successful Square was with their Final Fantasy games! And none of them are pieced together in some saga-like fashion; each of the games are their own epic masterpiece.

I am excluding MM from this discussion because if you came over from /r/zelda, we don't really need to discuss it any further.

My favourite Zelda game is Oracle of Seasons. I believe it is one of the best games for the Gameboy Colour system. It has a level of depth that you don't often get with portable games of that era. It seamlessly combines a puzzle mechanic (season changing) with a memorable adventure full of excellent characters

 A problem I have with many Zelda games is the fact that the games are mostly set in Hyrule. Even though the land changes quite drastically, Desert, Forest, you know. All of the Gameboy games took link out of Hyrule and into brand new lands, giving way for more creative landscapes. I liked Holodrum the most of all. When I played the game when I was younger, Subrosia, the subterranean land under Holodrum, because I feel that they are interesting characters which get less credit than they are due.

The seasons puzzle element was excellent. Each season gave you new ways to progress and manipulate the world around you and move forward. You had a strong desire to acquire the seasons because you know that they are going to help you along with your journey. It was a crucial collectible that paid off; something which is rare in adventure games, sacred jewels, boss masks) because you need them, but they don't do squat for you until you reach certain checkpoints. The seasons were more than a simple ""key to the final boss"". They were useful abilities prominent over the entire duration of the game.

I don't really like the idea of Termina being a parallel universe along side of the Hyrule universe. Most of the theories I've read about that are usually drawing a blank in most areas. It's also highly unlikely seeing as how Romani and Creamia are both 'counterparts' of Malon from Hyrule. How can there be two counterparts for the same person? What I do believe is that the entirety of Termina is all in Link's mind. I'm aware there are other theories similar to this one, but not US.

To explain why Link in his dreamstate, Link appears to be exhausted and worn out. I believe that the HMS put him into a deep dreamlike state at that point and everything from then on is an internal conflict with his own flaws. 

Majora is all of Link's negative thoughts and emotions while everyone else is a small burden that Link has to overcome. Every person he helps is a representation of what Link did for everyone in Hyrule. He saves everyone, or back in this case, Link will have to perform the same trivial tasks time and time again... or not. Link realizes that all of the people he's helping have no clue as to who he his or what he's done for them and while he's gallivanting around Termina, his lack of purity begins to grow. 

The Fierce Deity IS Link's physical representation of his rage and hatred towards the people he's helped who have so carelessly forgotten him. You obviously only get this mask after having collected all the other masks which means you've helped a lot of people with their own problems. The idea of the FD mask is that all that help was entirely futile and that is what throws Link over the edge and he loses control of himself in a blind rage.

The idea behind defeating Majora is Link conquering himself and getting rid of his negative thoughts and feelings. The more people he helps, it suddenly becomes so clear to him what his flaws are and what he needs to do to be rid of them which is what makes it so easy for him to defeat Majora.

But I always like to see a Zelda game as something separate and have come to understand that the series has never truly been about the plot. It's nice and serviceable but it's not a Bethesda

Instead it's a vessel for the game to take place.

Take Majora's Mask for instance. There's a lot of crazy theories (the stone tower temple being my favorite one) but things such as the parallel universe statement (which if I recall correctly is on the instruction booklet) are oftentimes taken too seriously when the game has the ""same"" characters due to the development which took 18 months.

Or about the timelines. I am certain Nintendo didn't start thinking of a connection between the games up until Ocarina of Time but they screwed up and had to do the whole split timeline thing because when developing the games, mechanics and the like before even thinking about a plot. Majora's Mask and Wind Waker are a prime example of this. They couldn't fit properly so it's only natural that they do the whole split timeline thing. Same thing with the classics. 

But when talking about the classics, screenshots on /r/zelda and others are often from the 3D games, I wonder why do most of us seem to enjoy the 3D games more.  Is it because of the ""dated"" controls? The graphics? Or is it because the connection between those games and the 3D ones is kind of blurry despite the now official timeline.

I think we do since the plot sometimes drives us towards completing the game and enjoying them more, the plot gets in the way of the game a bit far too often. The first 2-3 hours are a tutorial and for a 25 year old franchise, those things should be skippable, but they cannot since the the beginning of the plot is the tutorial.

Skyward Sword seemed to up the replay value of the game by adding Hero Mode and Goddess Cubes to quench your treasure hunting spirit. But after all of that

Nintendo could put a new currency in the game similar to Tales of Symphonia's Grade (it measures how well you do in battle and gives you points to spend on a NEW game). Attributes to this NEW game contain examples such as gain 10x xp per battle

This currency can come from Monster Drops or Secret Treasure Chests, such as enemies do 2x,3x or 1/2x damage; Double rupees or half rupees; You do 1/2 or 2x damage. These sound very undesirable, but again, I think it is difficult to add an element of RPG to a Zelda Game.

What is your opinion of these specific things in the game? Also

**Moldorm**

&gt;He is hard to avoid and knocks you off a cliff forcing you to backtrack through a room or two and face him again at full health. Being forced to backtrack after being hit only once is not my idea of adventure. If I have to backtrack I'd rather it be because I forgot something I knew that I needed or I'm searching more closely for treasure. Repeating a boss fight after only being hit once is not my idea of adventure. I'd rather fight a boss twice as hard as Moldorm (who wouldn't be that hard in a ""fair"" fight) than deal with cheap moves that cause boring repetition.

**Wallmasters**

&gt;They punish you for being inattentive (as you probably know you can tell they're coming from your shadow). I have no problem with that. They also take you back to where you most recently entered the temple. Again

**The falling rocks on Death Mountain**

&gt;I have no idea how to dodge these. They generally move down the mountain but often they move randomly to the side. If I'm missing some sort of way the rocks indicate their movement then just ignore this bulletpoint. If they do not give any sign of when they will move sideways then in my book it makes them a badly designed enemy. A good enemy to me is one that has a limited number of attacks. You may not know which attack they'll use but you know the possibilities and you can learn to deal with them better. A good enemy rewards learning and punishes a lack of learning. A random, especially one that is hard to avoid, randomly punishes you and you don't really learn anything. You just learn to expect you will take a random amount of damage when you walk through Death Mountain.

Termina is a mirror world to Hyrule. He sees Malon as a child, Cremia.
These two reflect Malon's personalitys.

My partner in crime. My candle in the dark. My shining hope.
You have saved Hyrule and countless other lands.  You have stopped demons, fire, earth, and even time.  Your courage only matched by the bravery of whichever sidekick is helping you along the way.  You've done so much for everyone and nothing for yourself. Sometimes I still catch myself, if only for a moment back in the mind set of my 8 year old self. Some of our best battles weren't played on a system.  They were imagined.  The hours I spent just roaming the country side with you, even after completing our quest.  Only you are such a good friend that even after we have had every adventure that there is to be taken, we still find eachother spending time, making up our own adventures in Hyrule.  Your a damn good friend. 

I want to thank you from the bottom of my heart container.  You gave me the tools I am most proud of in life.  All of my admirable traits come straight from you.  My intellect: Your puzzles and dungeons are beatable no matter how hard they may seem.  You keep pressing forward finding the most logical next step.  You take things slow, you gave me the patience needed to know something worth doing is worth doing right.

You are one of my best friends.  You give me a coda to live by.  I can only hope to be more like you with every passing day.  I owe you more than the price of your games

When I hear those first several notes it doesn't just bring me back to my childhood
Thanks Link
Sincerely
Your bestfriend",,t5_2tfzp,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/truezelda/comments/1gw2r7/dear_link/

1365031452.0,1bmfoa,Twilight Princess Fanfic (Part 1),fallenangel95,2,5,0,"Chapter One: 
	I sat in complete silence. The sand beneath me was warm and my feet were placed in the shallow water before me. There was a small waterfall in the distance, was sitting next to me, enjoying the peace that surrounded us. We were in Faron Woods, the forest just north of my village, taking a short break like we always do. We were heading back to the village after heading out to get some firewood, but the peace of the Spring brought us to a stop. The forest was the most beautiful at this time, with the setting sun shining its golden light through the leaves of the trees. In this forest, and I liked to believe that it represented me. At least… when I’m calm inside…
	With a sigh
	Home…No… that won’t ever exist again…
	I sighed again, I like to remember that I’m a lot stronger than I was before… that night 8 years ago… when I lost everything…. 
	I tore my eyes away from that damned reflection
	“Tell me…do you ever feel a strange sadness as dusk falls?” He finally said
	Silently thanking him for giving me something else to ponder, anger, self-doubt, that have been sealed inside me ever since that night seem to get to me the easiest during this time… as if I’m vulnerable to my own weaknesses in the light of the setting sun. I turned to him. “Yeah…but you know that I nearly always feel this way.”
	He nodded
	I shook my head dismissively, on a different note…” I said, clearing my throat. “Did you ever talk to the mayor about delivering the gifts to the royal family?”
	He chuckled. “Yeah. But it seems he wants to ask you about doing it. He said that he feels it as the right thing to do to give you the opportunity to explore the land of Hyrule, Link?”
	Remembering my brother and what he used to do brought a pang to my heart and I instantly thought of something to say to take him away from that idea. Staring at him with my mouth a gape
	He laughed, the mayor wouldn’t even mention your name if he knew you weren’t up for it.”
	Well then
	Before he could say anything in response, flowing mane. She was a horse breed that was meant to do a lot of heavy duty work, but that didn’t change the fact that she looked uncomfortable with all that firewood loaded on top of her back. “It’s getting late; we should start heading back.” I took ahold of her reins and looked her over, chuckling a little at how she was shifting her weight from side to side. “Plus, Epona looks like she’s about to collapse.”
	Russell got to his feet with a short laugh. “Alright
	I scoffed. “That’s easy for you to say. Sure
	The silence was soothing, I believe that everyone deserves a little adventure, even if it gets you into trouble.” He muttered. “That’s the only way you learn.”
	I was about to say something witty and sarcastic, I realized what he was saying. We don’t learn anything until we experience it ourselves. We can’t just go by memory or references from some third person point of view and call that learning.  If we did, we’d be clueless about our own emotions. Maybe… Maybe I’m being ridiculous. I said it myself; I’m a lot stronger than I was before. I shouldn’t ignore a great opportunity just because I’m afraid of facing my own emotions. I sighed as I led Epona and Russell onwards, heading across a wooden bridge into our village. “Fine then, I admit it. I’ve been running away from myself for too long and I need to give myself a chance to heal.” I snapped, feeling completely pathetic.
	Russell sighed. “I don’t need you to admit anything; I just want you to be truthful with yourself. It’s completely natural to avoid putting yourself in painful situations. But you can’t do it so much that you depict yourself as a coward…”
	Hearing that word made me stop dead in my tracks and I spun around to face him
	Russell stopped about as abruptly as I did, even if that risk puts you or your emotions in harm’s way. Some of those risks involve responsibilities. Didn’t you once say that you felt it right to take over your brother’s place in the village?”
I let my gaze soften and I sighed. “Yeah… I remember that. But saying it and doing it are two completely different things.” I said
Russell continued to follow behind me
	I didn’t answer to that remark. I just walked onwards, not even daring to look at the one place where the memory of my family remained; the cottage under the great oak tree in the very middle of Ordon Village. It was where I once lived along with my family for the first 10 years of my life. But then, it happened, and I vowed never to step foot into that horrid memory ever again. I led Epona through Ordon, heading to the very back of the village where we had a huge cornfield, planted and well grown. After walking through the stalks of corn, we came to a lone hill where a single tree stood. There was a house built up in that tree, with only a little help from Russell
           I tied Epona to a post I kept by my house, I felt like I had a beginning. Without them, I feel like I exist… just to exist. Like I have no real purpose.
       It makes me wonder if anyone else in the village truly knows what hell I went through. Especially Russell. He has a beautiful family. He has a son named Colin who’s really shy, is a wonderful person who is currently bearing their second child. They’re all a perfect family that stands up for each other and looks out for one another, keeping together with a bond that was so much more than words alone. They have everything I lost. Do they ever think about how scared I am? Do they ever try to understand that I am slowly and painfully dying inside and I hardly have anything left of me?
       I felt my eyes burn as I fought back tears. I’ve told myself so many times that it’s wrong to envy them. I can’t hate them because they have something I don’t anymore. But it’s so hard not to feel a little jealous

1354522604.0,146xas,Link is left-handed! Who's with me!?,jedi111,5,8,7,"For the past 25 years Link has been left-handed. It really irritates me that Nintendo has so little integrity to change such a specific aspect of Link because they're too lazy to try harder. I'm sure there are a lot of the younger generation here who maybe haven't played the older games so here are examples showing that link has literally been left-handed in every single game until Twilight Princess (wii) and then Skyward Sword.

Link is left-handed from the original

But do to a sprite mirror error

A link to the past is the first game where you can clearly see the designers obvious intention to make Link [left-handed](http://i.imgur.com/rMnu6.jpg). Even in the concept art he is depicted as [left-handed](http://i.imgur.com/PZ4zK.jpg).

Not until motion technology did Nintendo compromise this well defined character. The original release of Twilight Princess saw Link as the southpaw that he really is. However when they converted the game for the wii console they made him right-handed to accommodate the majority of the population. Not only did they make Link right-handed but they were too lazy to just remake his character model. They simply just mirrored the entire game. In the original, Link became right-handed and EVERY OTHER CHARACTER became left-handed; pictured [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMVjZApXnE8&amp;feature=player_detailpage#t=13s). Even the official artwork for Twilight Princess made him left-handed.

I just think they could have made accommodations for both at least. Like to be able to choose whether you want to play the game right or left-handed. I'm right-handed but i'd still play it left-handed. 

And now, they have compromised Link completely and made him entirely right-handed for Skyward Sword.

I just think it's lazy and incompetent on Nintendo's part to compromise the main character of 18 game titles over 25 years.

Link is left-handed. And he always will be.",,t5_2tfzp,1354555959.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/truezelda/comments/146xas/link_is_lefthanded_whos_with_me/
