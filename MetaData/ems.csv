The long version of the arrest was initially called for arm pain

We walk in to find the daughter giving CPR on the couch. Get him to the floor and get to work. CPR while we get the pads on, and transport. When we dropped him off, he had a good pressure (130/80 ish), was breathing spontaneously at about 22/min, but still showed no purposeful movement and had no problem with the tube. We cleared and the only thing I had heard since was that he was moved to the ICU. 

This was my 3rd resusc but the first one I thought had an actual chance of leaving the hospital. It is a great feeling. It is easy to get wrapped up in all the stubbed toe calls,False,,t5_2rmg0,False,,,t3_1gk3ex

Let me start by saying that I know we all bitch.  Everyone.  I don't care if it's Ricky Rescue or Retired Randy

But when grandma calls at 2 AM because her ""belly hurts"" and you know it's because she ate too much Mexican food

Our purpose isn't just to go in and ""save lives.""  If that was the case, they still need us.  An emergency to them isn't always an emergency to us.

We have a duty to be the patient's advocate.  Whether that means pumping on their chest for 15 minutes or just telling the nurse that they are cold so they get more blankets

Well guess what

Smiling and holding the old lady's hand will go a lot longer way than a pep talk telling her to just take some damn Tums and convince her not to go in to the ED.  They have triage for a reason.

Make her feel better.  Don't make the patient afraid or hesitant to call again in the future

And don't slack on patient care because you think someone is abusing the system.  When you run 1, what if you're wrong just once?  That 1 out of 1,000 where they really needed the stronger dose.  Addicts are going to find a way to get their fix anyway, so you might as well ensure that they are getting it safely by you doing it.

Sorry for the rant

We go out and find this guy laying on a mattress in the floor. Abdomen significantly distended and rigid, so I decide with the deputies and the patient that he needs to go to the university medical center up the road about half an hour. So the Deputy tells us they'll send a vehicle to tail us and keep us safe. All goes swimmingly

About 10 minutes out my partner, dispatch calls us to notify us that our patient has been released from custody while we were en route. Even though he still had ~3 months left on his sentence. The deputy just turned around and went back to the detention center. All of my patient's belongings were still at jail, he didn't sign any paperwork, we weren't notified. We wtf'd for a good little bit, and eventually told the patient what happened. Luckily, he was a nonviolent offender and an overall nice guy. He was mad too, because he immediately identified something I didn't. They dumped him so they didn't have to pay his medical bills. According to the ER nurse

Anybody have any similar experiences? Seems incredibly scummy of them to do. I'll be talking with my director today to see what can be done about this moving forward. Even if they want to do this crap

&gt;This original request was sent from Sgt. Robert Carpenter - Public Information Officer of the Virginia State Police, Va is sadly dying of terminal cancer and might not live to see Christmas. His special request is to receive Christmas cards from police officers, firefighters and EMS personnel.

&gt;The request then came to Chief James Seavey from Wesley Melson who is a volunteer Chief of Colonial Beach Rescue Squad and a career personal in Va. and then from Chief Seavey to me.

&gt;Besides a card

&gt;In this time of remembering our blessings and of giving I can think of nothing more appropriate then to give this little boy some happiness and our prayers.

&gt;Please quickly send to

This will sound more morose than I intend it to- or perhaps exactly as morose as I intend


I’m watching this lady’s husband tell her to stay calm, and we’re about to cut off her leg since her peripheral vascular disease has reached the point of no return and the skin around her foot has begun to spontaneously die. His words of assurance and calming are for himself. Convincing himself that his desire to hold on for just a bit longer is only due to love and not fear. That her case is different, and she’s about to turn the corner. That letting a surgeon cut off the lower portion of her legs is completely justified because he’ll have one more day. I know the truth. I know that this lady will in all likelihood never come off the ventilator she’ll be placed on for surgery. If she survives the procedure at all she’ll live out her few remaining days in the ICU with an endotracheal tube shoved into her airway.

 
We’ve arrived at the new hospital. The place (in all likelihood) that this lady will die. Far from home. Missing part of her legs. Hooked to machines, so I give her a little bit of Ativan. This is the life this lady gets to live in her final days. A nameless stranger who you won't remember- sedating you as you scream in the back of a vehicle taking you to a place you can't name. 


I don't mean to suggest that it's never worth it. I know what it is to truly save a life- to bring someone back from the very brink or even just beyond. It's just that it's so rare

My partner and I get tapped out for a male pt, begins BLS resuscitation efforts. On arrival we find the pt in the bathroom, pulseless and apneic, with no shock advised on FD's AED. 

We hook him up to our monitor and start working him with standard ACLS algorithm. Asystole, was still warm, etc. 

THis is where it got weird. THe niece runs into the room and tells us that the pt's wife is hyperventilating. So I send a firefighter to go check on her while we package the pt. (Yes I know it is more viable to work on scene but our protocols haven't caught up to the rest of the country yet). Firefighter yells back to us that the lady had passed out. So we call for a second transport unit. THey are only a couple minutes away. The firefighters get the lady on oxygen make sure her airway is open

As soon as the second unit gets there

Turns out she was in a VF to PEA to Asystole kind of arrest. Even the ED docs were pretty flabbergasted. No one had ever encountered a husband and wife arresting in such a close timeframe, etc. 

Both ended up being called in the ED by the docs after being worked for awhile. It was a strange and remarkable experience. ",,t5_2rmg0,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/ems/comments/16opmg/cardiac_arrest_x2/

They do things differently from what I'm used to, and we are required to wait that length for people to show up).  Today there was a dispatch for a man in his 40's who fell off of a roof, and it was near my work so I went right to the scene and arrived before anyone else.  He was CAOx3 and supine on the ground with multiple head lacerations, had a witnessed fall from a roof of about 10 feet with a less-than-clear recollection of what had happened.  He was also complaining of back pain, and stated he had injured it before.  He also thought that Clinton was the president, and had no idea of the day of the week.  

One of his co-workers had holding c-spine, and did a head to toe physical exam.  The ambulance arrived, and so did a county paramedic.  They made no effort to convince him to go to the hospital, successfully dissuading him and reassuring him that his wish to visit his chiropractor was a good idea.  They sat him up, removed the C-Collar I had applied, didn't bother patching up the lacerations, and all they did was flush his eyes with a Morgan's Lense.  

In my almost seven years in EMS, and am thinking about giving up EMS for the time being.  The Captain of the ambulance squad has no interest in getting me credentialed to practice ALS in this region, with his exact words being ""we don't really need another Paramedic.""  It should be noted that there is only one active Paramedic in this agency, namely the Captain. My job prohibits outside employment, so my only EMS outlets are the local volunteer squad, and an agency I volunteer with that's about 90 miles away (I put in the occasional weekend).

Roughly 16 hours into my 48 hour shift

I took the helm and got down to catching level. Mom was lying down in her small bathroom with her legs toward the door. My only position was in the doorway. There was no room to be comfortable and no time to change things. Talked to mom and got her to control her breathing. She was breathing and pushing erratically. I tried calming her down. She told me it hurt and she just wanted the baby out. I told her that if she breathes on with me and pushes when I say so, pushes on schedule and within 5 minutes the head pushes through. I can visualize the neck and check it for any umbilical involvement and we are good.

I tell mom that we can't stop now, fluids and all. My partner reaches in with the syringe and suctions mouth then nose. (we discussed it later and I suggested that next time its nose first then mouth), hands me a clean towel and I begin to dry the baby as well as stimulate it. I clean as much as I can off and change towels. I wrap baby tightly and continue to try to stimulate. Baby is not responding as much as we like. I rub stimulate more, rub and flick the feet and we have crying. Mom was freaking to this point but was now relieved, as we all were. Baby was crying, has motor function and was getting color in it's skin. The cord is clamped and cut.

Minutes later mom delivers her placenta and we make our way to the hospital. Baby is alert

This was an amazing experience without question. I can't help but to think how awful it would have been if there were complications or even a stillbirth. But luckily it wasn't. We all walked away very happy.

So that's my story. Many people in our work never get the chance. Last year with me on CPR

1340114285.0,v9xwg,Scene safety,,42,6,24,"Everything that follows is solely based upon my schooling and experiences in the field. I realizes these things vary person to person

I've recently changed my thought process about the ""scene safety"" aspect of our job. In school the mantra ""scene safety, right? Fire, assaults, Hazmat etc. are all obvious signs to not be there. But depending on where you work, is a scene ever ""safe""?

We stage for a psych. He's in his mothers house flailing a hammer around like a blacksmith. A 2 man cruiser responds with us. They make entry in front of us. Both of them are in the kitchen talking to the patient. Patients friend storms in the front door behind us and starts making a ruckus about whatever the hell he's yelling about and smashing lamps and shit. 2 cops on scene

One more on PD. Dispatched for the active assault. We stage down the block and wait till PD clears the scene safe. We're a good distance away, like assholes, and assumed we were fine.

Dispatched to a diff breather. No Hx of any respiratory illness. We go in, call PD and FD for a Hazmat. 

These are just a few recent experiences I've had. In my opinion, at least where I was taught, on how to recognize when a scene assumed safe, according to the caller and dispatch, is a danger zone. It is inevitably a lesson that has to be learned by experiencing it first hand. But unfortunately that means mistakes, possibly fatal ones, are going to be made. 

According to the Dept. of Labor

My rant boils down to this. Teaching ""scene safety"" isn't beneficial to our field anymore. PD can only do so much for us and we can't rely on them 100%. Don't get me wrong

Hopefully the newer EMT's (like me) can learn a thing or two by sharing some observations and comments. Sorry if this post gets really long.

Dispatched midafternoon for 62 Female with Chest Pain. Arrive on scene (BLS only while waiting for medic) and find slightly heavy-set woman conscious &amp; alert x4, brachial, or carotid pulse. Unable to auscultate a blood pressure. Listened to her heart with stethoscope and heard pulse of ~60 but very faint (didn't sound like a normal, strong heart beat). Intitial resp of 24, slightly distressed. Pt appeard quite anxious asking ""what's happening to me"" but also stated ""I don't want to have to go to the hospital.
History: No cardiac history or medical conditions, however, had open heart surgery 4 months prior so family cardiac history present. 
Medic arrives on scene after about 5 minutes. He goes to get set up in the rig and we assist pt onto stretcher b/c we wanted to load and go at this point. This is where it gets interesting.

Right after we get her on stretcher and moving towards the ambulance she now states ""I feel really dizzy, 2nd shock delivered. 3 more shocks are delivered (total of 5) and I believe 4 rounds of epi and 1 round of Amiodarone are pushed by the medic in total. After 5th shock pt started moving and had spontaneous eye movement. Medic checked the rhythm and no longer V-Fib. Faint carotid pulse is felt and pt breathing on own so we assisted her in breathing with BVM. We're about 2 mins out from hospital at this point. As wheeling her in I got the pt to squeez my hand and open her eyes when asked. Care transferred to the hospital staff. The END.

I just found out today that she coded at the hospital again and ""fully"" died this time. Anyways couple of thoughts/comments/reflection:
1. ALWAYS BE PREPARED for things to go South. This was just a ""typical"" chest pain patient to me and I wasn't expecting a full arrest. So always be ready for the pt to code. 
2. Agonal respirations are not respirations. The person has coded (or at least respiratory arrested) at that point. I initially thought she was ""still breathing."" I didn't realize til afterwards that the beginning of the arrest was actually in the house. 
3. Remember number one. No patient is typical.
4. Even if you've done almost everything right and had the patient obeying command after ROSC

If you actually read this whole thing I'd be amazed and thank you for that. Just wanted to share my experience about a witnessed arrest as they are rather unusual. I felt much better about this second code than I did about my first. Everything ran much smoother

You and your basic partner are dispatched at 2230 to a mobile home park for ""a woman with a severe headache"". Your response time is 10 mins.


You knock on the door and a woman opens it. She is around 100 kg


""I started feeling funny yesterday. Just like something wasn't right. My blood pressure was really high. Then this afternoon I started having this throbbing headache. Its the worst of my life. I'm also feeling dizzy and nauseous.""


O- She was sitting watching TV when her H/A began. 
P- She reports no provoking or palliating factors. 
Q- She describes the pain as ""throbbing"". 
R- It is primarily in her occipital region. 
S- 9/10
T-The pain began this afternoon around 1300
U- This has never happened to her before. 


Your partner obtains the following vital signs on scene


GCS 15 with no AMS. 
Pulse 50 S/R at radial bilat. 
RR 20 no longer labored after she sat down. 
B/P 300+/220 (The gauge on your BP cuff only goes up to 300). 
sp02 90 on RA. 


You notice some pill bottles on her shelf


Metoprolol
lisinopril
clonidine (you notice the bottle is empty)
Metformin
Levothyroxine.


What else would you like to know? What is your impression of this pt? What is her transport priority? What is your treatment plan? I'll be able to answer questions for the next few hours


Edit: In addition to the 12 lead below


**Edit 2** : Thanks for playing everyone! Thanks in particular to adenocard for the great explanation of clonodine action and withdrawal. I chose this run because I thought it showed an interesting pathology

Like many of you, and was concerned that this put her at high risk for a bleed. Her heart rhythm was a sinus rhythm with ventricular bigemeny, which she had no history of. It was probably caused here by the sudden dramatic increase in her blood pressure. Its worth noting that if you compare her palpable pulse to her EKG, you'll see that the PVCs were non-perfusing, with a pulse being generated only on the sinus beats. This would be an important in deciding if anti arrhythmics would be appropriate.

I transported her quickly, and monitored her closely for changes in her neurological status.

Interestingly, and she stated ""you know, I'm feeling a lot better. When she converted back to the bigemeny, her pulse fell back to 50 and she said ""Woh, something changed. i dont feel good""

I had fun doing this, and discussions like this are a great way for that to happen.",,False,,t5_2rmg0,True,,
