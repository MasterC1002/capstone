It is when the question is asked that the finder's search begins. Sometimes they too know the exact location of this lost memory, scouring the Internet, scrounging through loads of data and images, combing vast caverns of forgotten .com's just to find that one lost object, or sometimes (as I've personally done) visiting a place itself to find that which has been lost.

**EDIT if you can reference the point the book you are recommending it would be helpful

Someone posted this awhile ago, anyone know what it is? Here was the first post:   Note I put what I can recall in *my edit* format

""It is a child's book. Possibly from the 60s, I think it was from the 80's, I read it between 1983-87* . I only recall two things from the book. One is a child reading from a book with warm golden light pouring out. The other is a child in a small boat with a lantern hanging from an small hook above him. The boat is shaped like a chair with a tall back that curves around with the hook for the lantern. *MY EDIT I believe I remember this boat with a lantern hanging off the front of it going through a cave* If anyone knows what book this is I would be forever grateful. I loved it as a child. I seem to remember the book is sort of a compilation of stories. It may not be a single story.""

I could be totally wrong

I think the book flowed like he had the 1st adventure,  note that it might not have been exactly 3 stories, but something in that area, and finally back in his bed at the end

This has been driving me bonkers for 14 years.,,305,38,73,"My mum and I read a book about 14 years ago that we both loved and then rather stupidly lent it to a neighbour...who subsequently moved. Neither of us can remember the title; I've tried Googling it

Please please pleassseeeee help me find out the title and author.

THE PLOT:

It starts at the beginning with a man seemingly committing suicide by jumping off a building. Then

Time rewind to backstory for the CEO of the company: when he was a child/adolescent, has to go back to the pet shop and tells the owner that the rabbit died and he wants a new one. This time the ritual is a success and this causes his father to die of a heart attack (which was the intent as he has a rabid hatred for his parents). There's a little more backstory on him; he joins a devil worship 'club', which, for all intents and purposes, is just a big shagfest of orgitastic proportions involving making their way around the available women in the group.

Right, he’s a Cyclops! Chaos abound!
So the guy investigating his dad's death hooks up with another woman

Ends up with the two of them running around in the pharmaceutical building and she gets caught. They take her down in an elevator to the secret basement level labs (of course there’s a secret level) where the rapscallions do all their dodgy testing. We get to the point where they're about to pluck her eyes out of her head and replace them with eyes from massive GM frogs (this is fucked up shit). They escape somehow and set off the fire alarm system in the labs; which floods the area with halon gas (expelling all the air)

Very nearly at the end… somehow, the usual. Then the two of them have a face-off. CEO man is bustin’ his devil power moves; other guy goes into meditative state and slows his heart beat down. The line ‘One…beat…a…minute’ pops up in there somewhere. He stays like this and then releases a load of energy in one go and BOOOM, CEO dude go bye-bye.

I seriously hope someone knows the name of this book

I remember a game I used to play in the early 2000s that might have actually been three games under the same series for PC. They all had similar icon files, and a green train, I think (might have been yellow instead of green).

When you clicked on any of them, it might not even be a game at all. I remember one of the shorts was nursery rhyme of Three Little Kittens, setting might have been a tree house at night. Another was a blonde girl walking through a forest with a sing along.

This sounds completely fucked up

Well the last couple of photos he ever took were of him 'falling' to the point where he hits the ground

I cannot find this series anywhere and I've been looking for years. An art student I dated had the series on her wall and told me about them. So

*Edit - The photos were in Black and White. Now

** It is not Kerry Skarbakka btw.

***I was asked to try and sketch the set. This is best I can do and that comes to memory. I was a English major not an artist.

So the movie kinda goes like this: Frenchie 1 (maybe middle aged or a bit younger) is visiting his adoptive brother with down syndrome at an assisted living home and the brother is laying on the ground feeling the moles scurry underneath him.
BAM flashback: Frenchie 1 (maybe 10 years old or younger here) is living in a huge house with his mother, who we will call Frenchette. Frenchie 1's father disappears, and his mother is shopping with the kids at the market. As she reaches the cash register blood starts dripping from her forehead. So now the mother's out the picture, and Frenchie 1 and Frenchette are chilling alone at home, Frenchette takes a bath-
BAM incest: Yup. Incest.
BAM back to the present: Frenchie 1 runs into a woman who looks a lot like his sister and he falls in love with her. She loves him
BAM we're in the future now: Frenchie 1 is old and alone. Really don't remember what happens. Probably nothing important.
BAM flashback: Frenchie 1 and Frenchette are still doing the incest thing, starts to become jealous and threatens Frenchie 1 with a knife. Then something happens and Frenchie 1 is adopted by a nice family with a child with down syndrome.
BAM future again: We see Frenchie 1 still being alone driving his care, and the movie ends with Frenchie 1 driving behind a UHaul-esque moving van that opens up to reveal his sister playing the trombone and a guy singing on piano. He starts laughing and
BAM he turns into a plastic bag blowing in the wind.

It was log-shaped, but I do remember that the candy itself was in a folded white paper tray just like how the larger Tootsie Rolls are stored in their wrapper. The core was root beer flavored (it has been suggested that it may have been sassafras or sarsaparilla), translucent dark brown, with a texture and consistency like taffy (so if you pulled it apart you'd get those characteristic taffy ""tendrils""). This core was rolled in chopped nuts; it may have been walnuts, almonds, or hazelnuts, but definitely wasn't peanuts.

It was definitely a manufactured (not handmade) candy and I used to get it from the local ice cream man and the local pharmacy. This was in central New Jersey.

*Edited for words and details.*

Some of the responses are starting to repeat

* Specific candies that it is NOT include: Tootsie Rolls, Payday, Charleston Chew, candy sticks, fudge

* It is NOT a pecan log roll
* It was NOT bite-sized. This would have been the same size as a standard candy bar.
* It was NOT a hard candy.
* It had no chocolate anywhere on or in it.
* It had no peanuts anywhere on or in it.
* The core was not actually a taffy, but would pull apart similar to a taffy. Imagine, say, a Chuckle that you could pull apart and get taffy-like tendrils between the pieces.
* The core was not wrapped around or mixed with anything.
* I am pretty certain that this was not a sugar-free candy as this would have been in the mid 70's and ""sugar free candy"" wasn't really a thing back then.",,t5_2r4oc,1368300377.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/tipofmytongue/comments/1e2buz/an_unusual_candy_i_adored_as_a_child/

It looked like it could have been made in the late 70's

It starts with a white man(main character) walking into either a bar or movie theater. He hears men yelling “yeah” and clapping. He sees a group of guys sitting watching a movie that's being projected to a screen. (one of those old school projectors) He sits down and watches. (Now I'm going to describe the scene that this man saw) 
       --- a thin white woman with small breast, maybe feathers. The bearded man then grabs the blanket and drops it down. This reveals her naked body. The bearded man then picks her up and throws her onto the bed. Then you see the bearded man on her and a close up of her face. She is smiling and laughing.---

The men of the bar/theater are cheering this whole scene while the main character just stares at the actress quietly. He then realizes he is now by himself watching a blank screen.  He then goes out to search for this woman he saw on the screen. 

He somehow finds her agent

 I remember one strange thing that happen sometime later. They end up at some private party where guest play this deadly game. They lay on the ground facing up.. I don't remember how many but more than 6 people. There is a big heavy ball that's maybe black and spiky hanging above them. I don't remember if they were in a row or in a circle. The game starts by the ball being swung. It swings and swings. At some point it will just drop on one or two of them. This was the point of the game. It was like a game of Russian roulette. As it got closer to falling on someone

That's most of what I can remember. I hope someone else has seen it and knows the title, maybe a link to the trailer or entire film. Something. I really want to see it again. Thanks

Solved!!!! I fucking love reddit.  Its “Carnival of fools”  I can't find a trailer or film online to watch it and it might be a while before I can watch it, I discovered women are hiding beauty. I watched scenes of the film over and over. Rewind button was used constantly and I would stay up late watching in the living room. My dad didn't care but my mom was bothered by it. The girl and scenes in this film has shaped part of my erotic mind. There are two female looks that I find extremely attractive and one type is the girl in this film. She is probably why I like her type. She was the first nude I saw. I was so into it and my mom so bothered by it, my mother threaten to throw it away. I said she wouldn't really do that. She then took the movie and started walking outside to throw it away to the big dumpster. I walked right by her confident she really wasn't going to do it. Then when we both ended up at the dumpster, she just threw it in the big dumpster. I was shocked and cried. I was too small to climb it so I knew I was never going to see it again. I serious thought that if I ever won the lottery, that I would spend thousands of dollars for ads in two major city publications asking the readers if they know what film this is. That's how much I wanted to find this film. But with reddit and this subreddit I didn't have to spend a dime. Thanks to whoever created this subreddit.

Basically
Humanity has developed faster-than-light travel, in one way or another, obliterated themselves into extinction. This includes not only using weapons of mass destruction, but things like cannibalism and widespread suicide that seemingly occur suddenly and for no apparent reason.

Eventually, they aliens immediately attack the human ship. I forget how exactly, but eventually the humans find out that the reason they were attacked was because they came from a sector of the galaxy that inexplicably drives all intelligent life within totally insane, and now the other intelligent races of the galaxy are intimidated by this species that has come out of this sector seemingly unscathed.

Human governments and militaries latch onto this opportunity and exploit the other species' fear of us. This includes things like making all of our technology that comes into contact with aliens either by communication or trade look needlessly intimidating

She then begins rolling around in orange paint topless and pressing herself against canvas leaving boob prints.  It's ridiculous, it only had a couple of scenes with nudity.  I think it ends with the asian chick going crazy trying to kill the couple.  Not sure.

I'm looking for a very obscure arcade game from the late 90's/early 2000's. The gameplay wasn't anything special but what set it apart was the input method and the shape of the cabinet. I saw it... I think around 2003/2004 in one of those Haven Holiday parks in the UK. It was pretty weird. It spat out tickets

It was conventionally shaped but it was longer along the bottom ([doodle of layout included](http://i.imgur.com/tWch0fp.png)).

Now. Unusually, it slid left and right, forwards and backwards, just like a mouse does (though only so far) and it was also able to rotate on the Z axis. All were limited, with an absolute center, like a joystick but again, no X or Y rotation.

From what I can tell, like a mouse but it was measured like those pistons.

Hey reddit!


I have been searching the whole day because I want to find a youtube channel I visited months ago. Unfortunately did I not save the link and sold my old computer. You might think: ""God
THINGS I REMEMBER:


- It was on youtube
- There were 6-15 videos (each about 7-10 minutes)
- Most of the videos (all?) were INTENTIONALLY FAKED documentaries about paranormal or mysterious stuff.
- They were produced between 1970-1990 (you can clearly recognize the retro look and the low camera quality of that time). quality wasnt too bad though.
- The producer might be from France
- The documentaries were made to appear real
There might have been ""X Files"" ""Lost Footage"" ""Lost Files"" in the video name (not the series ""Lost Files"")


CONTENT:


-Video was about a stranded boat that was found, nothing to drink (i think he fished in 1 of the clips which were shown). he always appeared happy and in the last clip he leaves the boat and swims away, then u only hear some wierd sounds and you can hear that he gets pickd up by a ""light"" (the footage was mostly in brown colors, since the ""original footage"" used in the documentary was from the early 20. century

-there was an FBI coverup and it had to do with aliens, sorry.
there was an expedition on a mountain, I think there were aliens involved again.

-There was a child, then later how he was used for experiments. he ended up killing is family and the dog by drowning them in the pool. scary.
-There were more documentaries but i dont remember them.
If any1 provides I link or something that leads to the channel/videos

been older than the early 90's.
It ran something along the line of a mother and daughter on and Island
(or either they lived close to a shore in the neck of the woods) and
this man (a young man) rides his motorcycle around and falls in love
with the Daughter. The mother is upset with this and tries to ward of
the young man. The daughter ends up running off with the young man and
has sex with him in a motel
see's the mother stabbing him (she obviously doesn't its more like a
trick of the eye/him imagining it). The film goes on
that the mother wanted to keep the daughter on the island so that the
daughter would kill the mother (which there mother's mother had her do
the same thing)and carry on the tradition. I believe there is
something along the lines on an abandoned mineshaft where the murder
had happened of the mother's mother--infact there is a creepy little
scene where the mother is pointing a gun at her mother and the mother
runs up and puts the gun in her mouth.
The movie might have contained the words ""beautiful"" ""Heavenly"" or
""Creatures"" in it. I have watched the movies ""Heavenly creatures"" and
""Beautiful Creatures"" and these are not the movies.

rescued by someone (may have been a female riding some kind of hoverbike)

* They were active some time between the 60s and the 80s (my dad was born in 1953

- Vantage point (2006-8)
- Pulp fiction (1994)
- Babel (2005)
- Crash (2004?)
- Memento (2000)

The movie does'nt nessecarily have to show an event through different perspectives (Vantage point)

but can just have moments where characters 'flow"" in and out of the unique stories that center around a different character (Pulp Fiction)

or like in Memento where a mysterious story is told in un-chronological order several times often in the beginning of a new act or chapter where more details are revealed each time we see the same scene or event hence revealing more about our main protagonist and his (wifes

In the end with the help of a friend the researcher girl has to go into hiding in a compartment in the outer hull of the station to finish decoding the messages, an assembly is called where she reads the decoded message, which defuses the whole situation, and leaves the reader (at least it left me) with a sense of wonder.

A recently graduated high school girl, but never shows up and her car is found abandoned on the side of the road. Thus begins a massive search for her, but she's never found.

Book two: 
Slightly comedic, and becomes a very accomplished artist. The daughter has her own family, but treats her husband very poorly. She's emotionally unstable, as is her mother. It ends on a happy note, with the daughter reconciling her marriage with her husband, and the mother learns to be happier by eating more chocolate. The book is relatively thin and dark red in color. I think. 

Book three: 
This is a very thick book, who used to date this man, who is very good looking and sensitive, but still lives at home with his parents and without serious job prospects. He is currently dating a prostitute named Angel or something like that. Angel is incredibly introspective and bright, and the father of the missing child happens to be one of her customers. During the subsequent interrogation, she is bullied into sex with the police officers. The child is returned without incident, and I can't remember the circumstance of his/ her return.

The tumblr thing seems to be a recent change to reddit, and requires mod intervention to verify it's ok, and approve it. It would obviously be better if alternate links could be posted!

Regarding URL shorteners, containing unusual characters - brackets () for example, you should try putting a backslash \ immediately before each bracket in the link, that will usually work. 

For example:

EDIT 2: The thing with his wife was kind of a turning point in the book. I think he was on the run from the enemy organization, and they lived happily until the Association of Bad Guys found them. They did something to keep him from being able to jump back in time and rescue her, but I can't remember what. Anyway, they wanted him to do something for them, again I can't remember what, and afterwards his wife ended up dying. This left him with nothing better to do than take the fight to them.

**EDIT**: I can't confirm any answers since i haven't seen the movie

I'm remembering more about the description though

* The gradual rise and sudden stop is the most important part. I think the description said that it was so jarring that it made the audience's ears pop.
* The bit about the lack of soundtrack might be partially or completely wrong. I'm pretty sure there was no music at least in this part of the movie
* Same goes for this scene being at the beginning of the movie.
* This might be a false lead, but I'll make an edit here if I do.

I've seen about 15 years ago on late night television. 

The film is about a guy who lives together with his mum in some kind of a nuclear bunker. He is 20 or 30 years old and his mother feeds him

Every once in a while she leaves the bunker wearing a gas mask while the son is not allowed to go outside because of the toxic air and whatnot.

When she brings home a man who starts to live with the two the son gets very angry and suffocates his mother and that guy with a plastic bag while they're asleep.

He puts on the gas mask, reaches an exit and finds himself in a vibrant city of healthy people somewhere in a small american town. Maybe it's the 1950's. 

That's basically all I can remember. I don't even know if this was just 20 minutes or the whole movie. I also remember it as an independent production with no famous actors in it.

This sounds like an easy question

The most important clue is that the song was featured in a Virgin Megastore promo cd that I got for free in New York City sometime between 2004 and 2006 (I was in high school).

There are 2 tracks that I'm 100% sure were featured on that very cd.  One was the now very well known ""Don't know why"" by Norah Jones

Funeral for a Friends album, since I was still in high school I'd put the range between '04 and '06.

Either the band name, preceded by another word.  I do not believe the band is Hate .Inc because I've spent a lot of time on YouTube listening to their songs and it doesn't match the obscure tune that's in my head.

It's not Garage Inc.  everyone knows Metallica.

This song did have kind of a dark sounding yet heavy alternative metal theme (imagine ""So Cold"" by Breaking Benjamin

I've searched endlessly for ""Virgin Megastore promo CDs"" and any sort of search that would link Norah Jones and Funeral for a Friend to Virgin Megastore and have found nothing.  If there was a database of all of Virgins promo CDs

I'm hoping a Redditor out there may have better resources than I do.  I'm sorry I don't have a humming tape or anything.  To be fair

If I think of anything else

Here's a link to ""So Cold"" by breaking Benjamin for a general idea of the overal feel of the song http://m.youtube.com/watch?v=rTiGlNDnOtE

And here's a link to ""Holy Mountains"" by SOAD...the sound of the verse feels very familiar to the song I want 
http://m.youtube.com/watch?v=X-bNqBjKrQI

Hope I did this right.  I hope there's enough info.  I'm newish to reddit so let me know if there's some weird Internet winner award or whatever for whoever helps.  Thank you.

EDIT: I'm starting to think that I was wrong about Funeral for a Friend being in the same CD.  I've received some interesting links to discographies and can't find any that has Norah Jones and FfaF together, rather than AND.

Pretty hot girl and her step-brother (or something like that) are living together in some European country.  She's a model, and one of her model friends tells her about this super secret escort service that she might be able to join.  Turns out the state dept guy who's helping the pretty hot girl (PGH from now on) with her brother/boyfriend/lover is also investigating some murders where pretty girls are being killed in some kinda weird fetish lingerie that inflates (yes, inflates... like a bike inner-tube).

Sooo, massages, the usual ""pampered"" story line.  Oh lookie here in the underwear drawer, there's one of those kinky lingerie things that inflate.  Lots of weird stuff ensues, people are getting drugged by PHG with the designer drug via something they put in her tooth (of all things).  State dept. guy starts hallucinating about nuns.  Cheesy stuff.

Then it gets really weird.  Part of the process for getting into this super secret call girl ring is that she has to have all the hair removed from her body... including that special lady place down there.  So they make her soak her lady flower region in ""a green liquid"" and THEN PROCEED TO HAVE CRICKETS EAT ALL OF THE HAIR OFF.

All were watched on Comedy Central in the late 90's early 2000's. Three were ""Comedy Central Presents"" and another was a show that I believe was called ""NY Standup"" or something like that. It was like ""CCP"" but took place in a park in NYC.

So the first one. A Comedy Central Presents. The comedian was a average height white guy. He had a series of jokes about getting his first computer and looking up weird things online. The joke started with looking up dinosaurs, then girls naked then dinosaurs in panties. 

Second. Another Comedy Central Presents. Tall white guy

Third. Short white guy. COmedy Central Presents. I think his set was an old fashioned baseball scoreboard. I THINK. He had a joke about him and his friend getting a hooker that turned out to be a dude

Last was the one off comedy special. The set looked like a modern set but it was outdoors. The comedian was a tall muscular white guy who I believe was Canadian. He had a joke about smashing his penis in the hotel toilet seat (o_0).

I know that was a lot but these keep me up at night. I saw these all long ago when I was staying up late when I should have been sleeping and being a good student.

Any of these answers to these mystery comedians would be very helpful. I remember laughing for days while snoozing through math class after watching these guys.

2. It's an upbeat song with a fairly quick tempo. I can't recall the instrumentation.

One flashback is of a couple laughing and holding each other on the beach. He remember this vividly because he was struck by how carefree and in love two people could be. Another flash is from when he was a young newlywed and he was in a grocery store with his wife and newborn child. They go through line and he can't afford the food.

Link to older thread: http://www.reddit.com/r/tipofmytongue/comments/c59vj/tomti_cant_remember_the_name_of_this_moviemovie/

Let me explain to you what I know:

The first thing that happens is one man (Caucasian) getting robbed by a few men in a car. The thing that's got robbed is a suitcase he needed very bad. He calls his friend to pick him up. His friend shows up (also Caucasian) and he starts whining about the car his friend stole (it's quite a bad car). They both wear suits (?).

They get a call from the robbers about how to get it back. They start swearing and trace the call back to visit the robbers to try to get the suitcase back. Two other men join them in their quest to get the suitcase back (1 Caucasian and 1 fat African-American). Two of them go around the back with a slight detour (a few stairs and all). The African American man isn't really fit at all and starts breathing heavier (one of the parts I can remember very good). They don't have a hard time getting the suitcase back (4? robbers died in the gunfight).

They got the suitcase back and they go to some jewel store to steal something (?) don't know what the suitcase was needed for.

A few scenes I don't know where they happened in the timeline given above:

One scene is about the two first men going to meet an ex-girlfriend of one of them and he has sex with her. The other man is buying cigarettes and after he is done the other guy is done and they continue their mission.

One scene is in a dry-cleaner store where they (2 men) interrogate one man and shoot him. Also two customers who (unlucky) walked in to get their drycleaning get shot too.

One scene is in a alley where they (2 men) chase a man in a vivid colored training suit (red or blue?) and they manage to get to him and get the information they want. They let him walk away (?)

It is possibly an American movie and it all takes place in one city (don't know which city). It all takes place in a suburb like place. It was good weather (no rain).

One thing that stands out in this movie that the ASL (average shot length) is very high. It almost looks like the movie is filmed with one camera and in one take.

The movie was probably from between 1998 till 2007.

Hope you guys can help me out. Really want to watch this movie again :D

Ofcourse the question-marks explain the parts I'm not sure about!

On Dialing for Dollars they'd play a promo thing when it started up (kinda some quick shot from lots of movies) and during the promo thing they'd show (for like half a second) what looked like hundreds of medieval type guys and horsemen flooding out of what looked like a meteor, from all sides.  I imagined this to be some sort of time portal or maybe the thing was supposed to be manufacturing the guys coming out of it, but its hard to say with a 1/2 second clip.  This would've been a shot from a movie they played but obviously I never saw it.

Does anyone have any clue what movie this is from and what I'm talking about? I know the clues and a bit obscure but apparently this has been bothering me for 30 plus years (though I doubt I've even thought about it for 20 years - brains are weird).

Eventually the girl's brother is found and he speaks to her with sign language and we find out that she used to have red hair and violet eyes which were a sign of good luck but something happened to her and her hair and eyes changed colour leading people to think she was cursed or something?

The movie ends with them realizing that their search was in vain and that there is no hope. They are clutching each other and despairing.

The movie features a fancily dressed killer who is never fully shown; his face is always off-camera, or his shoes are shown.

There are three scenes I distinctly remember. The first one is set in an office building. The killer first removes the 'out of order' sign from an elevator. Then, but then the killer enters the elevator shaft, lights up a cigarette, and proceeds to burn one of the hands of the victim, who is forced to let go of the girder. The killer then puts one of his feet on the other hand of the victim, and pushes down hard, causing the victim to plummet down the shaft.

Another scene has the killer driving a white lorry. His second victim (who is either one of his henchmen or a corrupt cop) gets in the back of the lorry to talk to the killer. They have a conversation via a small grill between the drivers cabin and the back of the lorry. Again

The finale scene finally shows the killer in full. It is set in some basement, that is quickly filling up with water. Of course the hero is just in time to save the day.

I read a lot of scifi books at the time (scifi lit class) so i may be mixing stories but i distinctly remember the main character and maybe part of his expedition making it to the top only to find a rusted out space ship (possibly US but defiantly from earth) and some dead astronauts.

Pretty great book but i can't find anything from google and the prof doesn't even remember the book.

This was around 97/98 so it's at least that old.

I think the alien rave was a sort of hermaphrodite (but i was reading left hand of darkness at the same time and could be confused. I thingy it was the same book until i reread it again) and the main character had a limp and that was a big part of the first part of the story.

I'm trying to recall the name of a movie I saw when I was young. I remember watching it on TV. I don't know if it was a crappy film on the SciFi or if it was a blockbuster. Anyway

It was set in the future, and the future was really bleak. People were deformed, and if I recall correctly, people even had robotic implants. Because everyone was depressed with their lives, it was decided that everyone would get implants in their heads and a signal would be broadcast that made them perceive their lives were great. They wouldn't see the crummy house they lived in. Instead they'd see a beautiful house. They wouldn't see their own deformities, they would see healthy bodies. This went on for generations, and the babies received implants at birth. Eventually the people forgot what their real lives were like. 

That's the setting. Then we meet the main character, he has an accident and head trauma and his implant becomes damaged. He sees flashes of the real world, but he thinks he's just losing his mind. Eventually though, he figures out that what he is seeing is real and the life he is used to living is fake. 

I think he meets a handful of others who have figured it out as well and in the end they decide it's time to shut down the broadcast. I vaguely remember the broadcast was being sent out in a nearby nuclear power plant

From the look of what I'm remember in my head

There were a series of short stories about it starting with three inmates who were killed building the house for the warden of a prison (or just building a house). They were chained in the basement, and grew more powerful as it took more and more ghosts in. Eventually the people came to destroy the house, and set it on fire, however when they went back to their town they found their town on fire. They turned back to the house and it was fine. 

Various people came to live in the house over a hundred years or so

I also remember one of the short stories involved a fountain, but they waited too long and the house had taken too many so it was too strong.

Probably 1980s. I think it was a Charles-Grodin-esque comedy about this poor sap who keeps getting shit on by the world.

This guy's family is in dire financial straits. His elderly father suffers from dementia and needs constant care. The guy (let's call him Charles) is running around trying to prevent a bankruptcy or something. Meanwhile, so he keeps taking him to McDonalds which is very inconvenient for Charles, but hell, the old guy is about to die, so might as well give him what he wants.

Eventually we find out the old guy isn't as demented as previously thought. When Charles and the rest of the family shuts up for one second and actually listens to the old man, they find a shoebox containing a bunch of McDonnel-Douglas stock certificates. Mcdonnell Douglas was a successful airplane manufacturer that eventually became Boeing. The stocks certificates are worth a fortune.

1) Some guy gave one of the protagonists a heart attack by just commanding that it happen. IIRC it was a homeless man. He gets up from his bench and randomly says to the other guy ""{something something} oh look you're in cardiac arrest."" 

2) SWAT type people are going through an apartment building shooting everyone. I think they were looking for the protagonist. They open a door and this woman is riding this guy. I vaguely remember one of them stopping time and then shooting the guy [and maybe the woman as well.)

I don't even remember if it was a good movie I was just thinking of ideas for story ideas and remembered those scenes of that movie. It would be great if one of you guys could find it.

1308061794.0,hzf4z,[TOMT] i've been trying to remember the name of this book for years [book],godlesspriest,49,8,15,"**EDIT: I found it

It was quite a few years ago that I read it.  The genre was pretty much medieval fantasy

The story starts with the young-ish main character falling in love with some kind of prostitute.  He tries (I can’t remember if he succeeds) to trick her into loving him back via some form of love potion or spell

Later

So they all go on a journey together, the main character and the expedition leader dude have a fight, I don’t remember over what.  The main character wins, and stabs the other guy through the chest.  I distinctly remember the guy who got stabbed saying ‘when you take this sword out my soul comes with it,’ or something like that.

Other random details I remember:

At one point

At another point, or some kind of ‘glimmer,’ or… something.  The author talks about the almost intimate relationship that develops between the torturer and the tortured.

The expedition leader has an orgy in his tent.     

Something about a ferret?

The main character has a fight with some evil prince

Anddddd that’s about it.  I know I’m throwing a lot of random stuff out there

I would be SO excited if I could re-read this book.  If anyone knows which one I’m talking about

Thanks!
