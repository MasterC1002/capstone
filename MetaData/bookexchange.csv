Where I live there is a second-hand bookstore.  The way that they're set up

My whole family loves to read.  We're always reading books.

I found out about the bookstore about 4 years ago, I had about $3500 (USD) in-store credit.  I still have $250 of it left.  I'll tell you about a time that I spent 200 of those dollars.

I had stopped in just to browse, there was a woman and her young son buying some books.  I didn't really see what she had, but they looked like used textbooks.

The kid was standing near the childrens section, ""Sorry, I've only got enough money for one.""

You know the thing that's been floating around reddit for a little bit?  The whole ""in the feels"" thing?  Well

I kind of hovered around the store, so I got in line right in front of her.  When I was talking to the clerk, they love to chat there, I asked how much store credit I had left.  At the time, it was probably around $700-$800.  I asked the woman behind me if I could buy their books for them.  I told them that it wasn't really money at all to me.  I told her how I had brought a bunch of old books in, and have a ton of in-store credit.  She said yes, with a huge smile on her face, picked up my books

I used to be extremely religious. Went to Bible college and everything. There are a lot of Christian books here. Some of them were so influencial in my life that even though I no longer adhere to their brand of faith, so don't discount the list if you're not of that flavor.

**EDIT:** Someone asked about my current tastes in case anyone had anything to offer. I like to read horror and really good sci-fi. Fantasy too, Sagan, or Degrasse-Tyson. I need to.

**EDIT 2:** I didn't expect this to take off tonight. I thought perhaps in the morning I'd have a few messages and more would filter in throughout the day. Please bear with me as I go through them all. It's first-come-first-served when a book has been requested by multiple people.

**EDIT:** Some of you are asking where I'm shipping from. Sadly for your wallets, use [this site](http://www.royalmail.com/price-finder). You'll need to know how many books you're buying. For those who live in the US, assuming that the mean weight of the books I'm selling is ~400 grammes (which is, I believe, a liberal estimate) and that you don't mind waiting a few weeks for the book, you're looking at $7 for a single book.

* It's fun to hate

As usual, but I'll ask you to cover shipping.  I plan on doing this until I run out of books or money, so if you win a book from me you won't be eligible again for 99 years.  Also, please **don't enter with throwaway accounts**.  There is a 99.9% chance you won't log back in with the throwaway, which means you won't see my attempts to contact you should you win.  Good luck to all those who participate, and I will update this post to announce a winner.

As usual, but I'll ask you to cover shipping.  I plan on doing this until I run out of books or money, so if you win a book from me you won't be eligible again for 99 years.  Also, please **don't enter with throwaway accounts**.  There is a 99.9% chance you won't log back in with the throwaway, which means you won't see my attempts to contact you should you win.  Good luck to all those who participate, and I will update this post to announce a winner.

As usual, but I'll ask you to cover shipping.  I plan on doing this until I run out of books or money, so if you win a book from me you won't be eligible again for 99 years.  Also, please **don't enter with throwaway accounts**.  There is a 99.9% chance you won't log back in with the throwaway, which means you won't see my attempts to contact you should you win.  Good luck to all those who participate, and I will update this post to announce a winner.

I also have a couple that I am aptly naming the ""baseball pack"" and the ""poetry pack"", I've taken the books that don't really fit into any of these author's categories and stuck them into groups of 4, which are completely random and I'll do for $12 shipped. It's stuff I enjoy but if for some reason you don't enjoy it, you can always come back here and trade them with people who will! (The circle of book exchange life goes on!)  

I also like to throw in a random book every now and then if I have extra space in an envelope

Please remember that all of these books were read/owned by me so although a lot of them are in new/like new condition

Feel free to message/comment if there's anything else you'd like to know! Keep reading!  


EDIT: Btw

EDIT 2: I also want to reiterate that only ONE book from the author is included in each pack. The other two books are books by different authors that I selected based on your interest in that author. This is not a 3 pack from the same author,False,,t5_2rl8w,1365448775.0,,us,t3_1bwin8

As usual, but I'll ask you to cover shipping.  I plan on doing this until I run out of books or money, so if you win a book from me you won't be eligible again for 99 years.  Also, please **don't enter with throwaway accounts**.  There is a 99.9% chance you won't log back in with the throwaway, which means you won't see my attempts to contact you should you win.  Good luck to all those who participate, and I will update this post to announce a winner.

As usual, but I'll ask you to cover shipping.  I plan on doing this until I run out of books or money, so if you win a book from me you won't be eligible again for 99 years.  Also, please **don't enter with throwaway accounts**.  There is a 99.9% chance you won't log back in with the throwaway, which means you won't see my attempts to contact you should you win.  Good luck to all those who participate, and I will update this post to announce a winner.

1364944751.0,1bjsxr,Free children's book in exchange for funny drawing to help cheer a friend up.,SirSlothySlothPaws,16,5,10,"I will send you one of the three book that I made for free. You can tell me what you want written in the front of the book. In return it would be great if you could sit down with your kid and draw a funny animal maybe a sloth or platypus and send it to the return address with the envelope addressed to Kaela. Kaela is a friend who is feeling sad because of some recent events

First choose a book you would like from my website www.beausbooks.com

Send me a message by reddit telling me which one you would like and tell me who I should make the inscription to. Also tell me where I should send the book (sorry I can only ship inside USA). Assuming USPS is still in business you will get your free book sometime in the near future. I only have about forty books at my house so I guess I am obligated to say

Once you have read the book with your child and you have some free time sit down with your child and support them while they draw a picture of any animal

And thanks

As usual, but I'll ask you to cover shipping.  I plan on doing this until I run out of books or money, so if you win a book from me you won't be eligible again for 99 years.  Also, please **don't enter with throwaway accounts**.  There is a 99.9% chance you won't log back in with the throwaway, which means you won't see my attempts to contact you should you win.  Good luck to all those who participate, and I will update this post to announce a winner.

As usual, but I'll ask you to cover shipping.  I plan on doing this until I run out of books or money, so if you win a book from me you won't be eligible again for 99 years.  Also, please **don't enter with throwaway accounts**.  There is a 99.9% chance you won't log back in with the throwaway, which means you won't see my attempts to contact you should you win.  Good luck to all those who participate, and I will update this post to announce a winner.

[EDIT] If you see something you want but don't have anything I'm asking for, action/adventure, and drama. I'm not to familiar with adult fiction but again I am open to suggestions. This is a very large list of books that I have enjoyed for long enough and they need a new home as much as I need some new reading material.

[EDIT 2] For practicalities sake I will say I live in the US and would like to keep trades in the US as foreign post can get quite expensive. Also I am labeling things as (RESERVED) if a trade is proposed to me and taking things off the list as trades are completed. You guys are awesome,False,,t5_2rl8w,1340726136.0,,,t3_vecni

As usual, but I'll ask you to cover shipping.  I plan on doing this until I run out of books or money, so if you win a book from me you won't be eligible again for 99 years.  Also, please **don't enter with throwaway accounts**.  There is a 99.9% chance you won't log back in with the throwaway, which means you won't see my attempts to contact you should you win.  Good luck to all those who participate, and I will update this post to announce a winner.

The husband reads westerns (Louis L'amour) and the wife reads historical chick-lit-ish books and I read all kinds of non-fiction (biology, history, computer science, poetry, books in Spanish, you name it).  You don't necessarily have to trade back one western if you receive two.  You could always send a chick-lit-ish type book or a non-fiction in return.  Please feel free to surprise us. 

* Here is what I have from the wife:
* Christmas in Plains by Jimmy Carter
* Eat Pray Love by Elizabeth Gilbert
* In the Company of Others by Jan Karon
* Hidden Summit by Robyn Carr
* Secondhand Bride by Linda Lael Miller
* Off Season by Anne Rivers Siddons
* The Girls They Left Behind by Lillian Harry

For this sale, and if anything is left over I may try to do a New Year's giveaway on here... but only time will tell! Here's how it works: You message me and tell me what you want and where you're located, and I'll respond with your shipping price and paypal address. You can pay whatever you want for the actual book, but you MUST cover shipping and handling. I think that's a pretty fair deal! Also, one other rule. The limit on books per person is three. I'm implementing that rule so everyone has a fair shot to get something they want. After a couple days from the post date, the rule will be removed and everything will be fair game. I'm sure you understand! If you have any questions, feel free to message me.   

For this post, and some books from my personal collection, so hopefully I have something for everyone here. Keep in mind that these books are used, so they may have a little wear, but I've tried to ""grade"" these books based on condition (A being like new, F being very poor condition) and will list why it received the grade. If the book is a first edition, I will put a (1E) next to it as well. I will also be throwing in some books with a couple random orders. All books are paperback unless otherwise noted.

1351721515.0,12f9il,Suggestion/Request for helping find books.  Please share your opinion.  ,charles4,11,2,7,"This is a suggestion that would help me find specific books people are looking for.  Maybe it is something that would help others too.

I go to a thrift shop near me at least once a week and look through the couple thousand books they have.  I see a lot of things that don't particularly interest me but that I think might interest others.  I see a lot of popular titles and see things that are several decades old to stuff that is probably still on a bestseller list.  

My trouble comes with trying to figure out what to keep an eye out for when I go looking.  I don't get a whole lot of time to spend on the internet so making things more concise would be a great benefit.  My idea is that there could be a list where each person looking for particular books submits their top three or so and it is has a uniform format.  This would allow anyone who might go to thrift stores like myself or book fairs to quickly see what titles others are looking for.  A simple list would be easy for those with internet on their phones to pull up and check while they're browsing bookshelves.  

This isn't an attempt to eliminate individual posts.  Those are obviously necessary in terms of people looking to pass on books and have more detailed discussions about what they are or aren't looking for.  (ie. Someone who is looking for ""any science fiction books"" can have space to elaborate what they mean by that

One of my initial concerns was that there might be trouble having to constantly update this list.  When I clicked on the New tab in this subreddit I noticed the first page of 25 posts were at most 9 days old.  I don't know if that is very active with 6

Unfortunately this is also a bit of a selfish request.  I can only volunteer so much for such a project.  As it stands I'm quite busy with work and don't want to commit to something that I might have little time to support.  

tl/dr : List of community book requests to better match readers with the books they're looking for.

As usual, but I'll ask you to cover shipping (which will be high for this one since it is a big book).  I plan on doing this until I run out of books or money, so if you win a book from me you won't be eligible again for 99 years.  Good luck to all those who participate, and I will update this post to announce a winner.

**UPDATE: The winner is [Luvutoo](http://www.reddit.com/user/Luvutoo).**

Everyday other than Tues/Wedn. they have a book store that is open to buy books. Every book is a dollar. And they are ALWAYS getting books. So 1: I bought a bunch and am slowly trying to read and then give them to people who want them. I'll make a list at the end. I figured after I'm done reading them I'm more than happy to exchange for whatever offers you guys want. (Admittedly it might take me a while to read them. I don't want to speed read obviously. So this is more for if you are in no rush for a book) 2: If anyone has been dying to get a book but can't find/afford just put a request in here. I'll keep my eyes out when I go to the store. They have a shit ton of the usuals like Michael Chrichton, the ones I have and am reading will probably take a while because I have books on Kindle I want to get through as well. Sorry if this came out terrible but I thought I'd offer my services. I mean come on...a dollar a book! With specials pretty frequently where they are 50 cents. So if this was stupid just let me know. No hard feelings.

Books I have now

* ~~Life of Pi~~ (Read)
* The Wind Through the Keyhole
* The Gunslinger
* Nightshift
* ~~Under the Dome~~ (Read)
* ASOFAI Books 1
* Jurassic Park and Lost World (There are many copies of these at the lib)
* Dune
* Beat the Reaper
* Wicked
* Never Let Me Go (Read)
* Thomas Covenant Book 1
* Timeline
* Pirate Lattitudes
* The Easter Parade
* Nine Princes in Amber 
* Born Standing Up
* Bill Simmons RedSox book (Almost done)
* The Beach ( Two copies)
* Stranger than Fiction (Chuck P)
* Catcher in the Rye (Read but very beat up)
* The Road

If you want any of these listed above just let me know and I'll save your username and PM you when I'm done. Might be a while though. I guess this is a good show of what I like. Fantasy, King. Just throw an offer my way and I'll let you know if it interests me.

I'd be willing to trade these for some other books, or just let you have them if we can find a way for you to pay for shipping.

As usual, but I'll ask you to cover shipping.  I plan on doing this until I run out of books or money, so if you win a book from me you won't be eligible again for 99 years.  Also, please **don't enter with throwaway accounts**.  There is a 99.9% chance you won't log back in with the throwaway, which means you won't see my attempts to contact you should you win.

I am an avid reader that's looking to distribute books to low-income families locally and in neighboring areas

**Jude the Obscure** (Hardy) As new. Never opened. I don't like Hardy.

**Writing About Literature

**Women Writers in Renaissance England** (Anthology) Used

**Mayor of Casterbridge** (Hardy) Also never opened

**The History of the Future** (Wilson) Ever so slightly dog-eared.

**Crime and Punishment** (Dostoevsky) Very slightly dog-eared.

**Don Quixote** (Cervantes) Slightly dog-eared.

**Hard times** (Dickens) Book is heavily used; first page of each chapter has been folded in the corner. However the cover itself is in perfect condition. No markings inside or out.

**Reinventing the Sacred** (Kauffman) Dust jacket shows a bit of wear along the top edge

**Misquoting Jesus** (Ehrman) Like new

I am an avid video gamer and an amateur tabletop player. One of my favorite games is Sid Meier's Alpha Centauri.

One of my great friends has the Alpha Centauri GURPS book, made me go all giggly and cute. 

I was, and that no dealers have it in stock.

Is there a kind nerd/geek out there that is willing to part with a copy of this? I will gladly come back later with my volumes available for trade when I have gotten some sleep (It's nearly midnight on my coast).

Thanks and have a great one!",,t5_2rl8w,False,,us,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/bookexchange/comments/o56bl/want_alpha_centauri_gurps_source_book/

I also have a few books about Bob Dylan. I think I have 3. I'll set all 3 for $10. I also have two hardcover copies of Shel Silverstein's ""Where The Sidewalk Ends""

Please remember that all of these books were read/owned by me so although a lot of them are in new/like new condition

I do all sales through paypal, please let me know your location! If you're in Canada, Mexico, Australia, Mordor, or The Moon, I need to know so I can calculate shipping beforehand! (This doesn't mean I won't ship to hobbits, or australians

Seriously though, but books in general. There's so many wonderful people writing so many wonderful things and it's hard to take the time to appreciate all of them. Happy spring, everyone.
