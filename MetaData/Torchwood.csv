However, but now, with much more life experience, I've discovered that it's really a message that you're always living life to the full, no matter how trivial and unimportant what you're doing really is.

We focus on the good, which, while painful sometimes, are just as important as the good things. We focus on the big events in life, when the small, everyday pleasures and frustrations are just as, if not

Essentially, it's all a worthwhile exercise, defining who we are and the legacy we leave behind.

It has been a while since I saw all the seasons but the ones I remember the most are the third and fourth (third because I was sad that they were ending the show and fourth because I was excited and thankful that starz picked it up again).  The main reason I started torchwood was because of Jack and it being a doctor who spin off but it became it's own thing.  I think the one persistent problem I had with the show was Gwen.  First season she was the newbie so her behavior was understandable but then the second season it kind of keeps happening but honestly looking back I think the main problem was that she had a personal life which screwed with everything.  

Anyways, I can't recall it all but I would rank season 1,2,4 all equally good but the 3rd was just too damn awesome, by far my favorite.

I am trying to come up with a list of Torchwood episodes so they can get a feel of the series and have a better appreciation of Children of Earth.  Then hopefully they can be convinced to go back and catchup with the entire series.  =P

Seasons 1 and 2 were ok, things are suddenly... great! This miniseries is gripping, frightening, powerful!

Until they get to Day 4, of course). Then, at the very end, all those dead people are laid out in a gymnasium, under blankets, and they're letting any old person just walk in there and see them?!?!

How the hell am I supposed to believe that the sucker-punched government is going to enter Thames house, deem it not dangerous or contagious anymore, remove the bodies, and allow anybody to walk up to them without protection or precaution?!

This was the point where I became disillusioned. I watched Day 5 just to finish it out, blah blah blah. It didn't get better. There was no real conclusion, no resolution. Nobody questions why they are dealing with druggies?! That doesn't change their policy? Not one mention of how the government, nay, how the world, changed 6 months later, just some half-assed attempt to end Torchwood as an institute when the world needs them most?

Children of Earth felt like the BBC wanted to step up and play in the big leagues of well-produced and well-written television, fun, almost b-rate sci fi series, and just when I got my hopes up that it had graduated to something more serious and dramatic, the rushed conclusion and loose-end questions only stood out all the more obvious.
