I mean
Part of the challenge/appeal of Chiptune, is working within a limited scope, and figuring out how to push that boundary.
LSDJ is the MS Paint of music-making programs.
But you can make sweet art with MS Paint.
Or you just photoshop shit together.
Whatever.
The point is..NOT all electronic music belongs with other electronic music. 
You can take your diarrhea wobbles over to the diarr..er
I guess that's it. 
Sorry for hatin

Edit: I don't dislike all Dubstep, and this is a great place for them to get their stuff heard and get awesome feedback/support. When their posts get buried under posts that should be elsewhere, it makes me mad. And since Dubstep is what's popular electronic-music-wise right now, many of said posts fall under this category. 

Edit2: Thanks for all the input/comments/criticisms/sass! I didn't mean to hate on Dubstep artists. Sorry for being so catty. And thanks,False,self,t5_2qlmr,True,,dmg-blue,t3_p4mji

I loved 8BC - it was a great community and everybody there was constructive and helpful. There were some brilliant artists on there too - [Spaceman Fantastiques](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aykz504h174&amp;feature=related) was my personal favourite. But it has now been down and undergoing ""maintenance"" for a long time. Now the front page can't even be accessed as the whole site is down.

As much as I hate to say it

The rumour is that next time domain payments are due

There seems to be a good userbase here already - I'm sure that if people from 8BC came here and started posting their videos through Youtube or Soundcloud

So basically, and let's build a greater community!

I make Chiptunes on my Game Boy. Before that

The reason I'm here is that I've noticed a huge push in the direction of Fakebit on this sub. Maybe it's just me

It probably doesn't matter to most. I'm sure many Chip listeners aren't going to care to dissect the specific sounds, RGB, Amiga, Commodore 64, etc) or ""fake"" ones (made using an advanced program [Ableton, FL, etc] using plug-ins). I see many comments on these threads asking ""How'd you do that?"" in so many words. So the curiosity is at least there in many listeners. 

Additionally, Animal Style, and many others utilize this method, and as a long-time musician and relatively recent Chip musician, I do, too. I only bring this up to show that I stray from pure Chiptune to make a product that (hopefully) will appeal beyond our very small community of loyal fans.

So..back to the original argument. Does this matter to you, etc)? Or maybe it's a passing interest and the casual musician will use what's around? Is it about the strength of bass kicks? Is it pertinent to the kind of video games you played as a child (growing up playing NES vs. Gamecube, for example), and as an adult you mimic the sounds you remember from your youth? Ah, so many different angles!

For the record, and do not wish to burn them.

So

EDIT: The consensus says the format is irrelevant if the music is good. Thanks for your input

But i thought i would try and find the artists i had once so loved and perhaps even return to the world of sound

So i am putting up the two albums i made with songs i liked (i even have a cover i liked although fairly irrelevant)

Here is
[8-Bit](https://www.dropbox.com/s/ka4ltta66v8tzq6/8-Bit.7z)
and [8-Bit II](https://www.dropbox.com/s/y1be02gfr3wviuo/8-Bit%20II.7z) 

I had started collecting for 8-Bit III but only had a few songs i liked

Finaly the reason i am doing this is to find out who made each of these so if you recognize one of the songs please tell me so i can edit the info in itunes/go see what else they made

Thanks Guys

I've been listening to a bit of chiptune that my friends have recommended to me and I'd love to start making my own tracks but I honestly have no idea how to. I mean, what equipment do I need? How to I connect it all up? How hard is it doing live stuff compared to recording separate tracks and layering them in a studio? How much does a decent setup cost?

I'm not completely new to music either. I played guitar for a few years, which is where I get my love of faster chiptune tracks I suppose.

I believe these are all shareable (he says on his notes that all this content is Creative Commons) so I figured i'd run a torrent for it so all chiptuners around here can get a grab for it

- Music (Amiga/C64/A2600/DMG)

- Videos including Live @ Blip Japan 2011

- Bonus music (other non-chip unreleased stuff + weekly beats)

- Atari 2600 dev software (Windows)

- Amiga Disk Files for Emulator (Win/Mac/Linux)

- A guide to using an Amiga emulator and how to mount ADF files

[I made a reference image of all the things that are on that torrent file](http://i.imgur.com/dCxhZ.jpg).

I will not be able to seed this for a long time. Matter of fact

**☛ [Here's the link to the torrent file on TPB](https://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7129207)**.

Other notes from cTrix on the disk:

&gt; Most of the tunes are at least semi-mastered
The Gameboy stuff is pretty raw for the most part.  I had lots of 
requests to leave it untouched
and hit record.
