The final scene of Hamlet, due to his own neuroses, he can never enjoy a stable romantic relationship with her.

The back-and-forth dance of absurdest humor and bleak existential despair characteristic of 'Waiting for Godot, and many of the playfully whimsical but also deeply hurt songs written by Leonard Cohen during the 1960-1970s and by Tom Waits during the 1970s-1990s  are exactly what I'm attempting to capture.

Thompson's writing voice, or Shel Silverstein's - an eye for the silly and the dire, ecstatic and the seedy, life-giving and life-taking, all stacked into a single sandwich that each of us eats every day.

So I have been reading game of thrones and I came across a theory not too long ago where they proposed that one of the characters had a ________?? In this case we are talking about a knight who is for all intents and purposes amazing at his fighting ability. His right had is very important and integral for this notion. However

You could also put it for another character who is given a sword. She loves this sword because she is a little tomboy and her brother gave it to her. So she treasures this object with all her life force and does whatever she can to protect and keep it. A couple of books later she is forced to abandon this sword

Both parts of these stories draw the idea that these artifacts carry a very important role to that character and I just can't think of what that theory/principle/word is.

Hi. Trying to figure out the word for phantom sensations (re: 5 senses) on a body when a disconnect happens.  Sort of like being in a sensory deprivation chamber and feeling silk across your skin

I thought it was the word ""psychosomatic"" but that may not be quite correct.  I also came up with the word ""psychosometric"" but it seems that word is incorrect in this context.

Thanks in advance. I'm happy this subreddit exists (as I just discovered it 10 minutes ago).  Good day to you all.
