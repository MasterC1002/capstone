## Five steps to DRM activism

1. Go to http://dayagainstdrm.org and pledge to take action.
2. Send the link to all your friends on your social networks.
3. Go to the [LibrePlanet wiki page and list an event you'd like to run](http://libreplanet.org/wiki/Group:DefectiveByDesign/Day_Against_DRM_2012#Events) (see below for ideas)
4. Email us at the FSF -- campaigns@fsf.org -- an address (in the US and Canada for sure
5. Plan your event on campus or in your local area

## Some ideas for events

* Have a pizza party in your dorm room -- ask people to make their pledge on the http://dayagainstdrm.org website to sign up.

* Throw a frisbee around for an hour. Afterwards

* Ask your school's library to sign a pledge against DRM-ebooks and DRM-textbooks.

* Post copies of [The Right to Read](http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/right-to-read.html) all over school. 

* Hand out anti-DRM stickers

* Wear your anti-DRM buttons with pride,,False,,t5_2qh3i,True,,True

I've already had this gone over by the PC-building enthusiasts at /r/buildapc for technical compatibility

Some notes:

* I know that the CPU has an AGPU in it
* I already have my own mouse and monitor
* The Asus F2A85-M motherboard was chosen because
* The GTX 660 Ti GPU was chosen because

And my questions for you guys:

* Does the AGPU on the AMD CPU pose a freedom issue? Are binary drivers or firmware required for it to work?
* Is the 3D / 2D acceleration using the nouveau driver for the GTX 660 Ti GPU too unstable to be usable?
* From this page: &lt;http://nouveau.freedesktop.org/wiki/FeatureMatrix/&gt; It seems that video decoding using my graphics card would require binary firmware? Is my assumption true? How important *is* video decoding?
* Are there any parts in this build that pose a freedom issue? Would Richard Stallman use this computer?

&gt;Our next donation target is the Free Software Foundation.

What we need now is what GNU did in the 80s but for Android. We need a project that sponsers and develops all of the tools people would want as their Android userland: a microblogging client, an IM client, widgets, a mail client, etc. We essentially need what GNOME does but without the desktop, OS, or APIs (well a GNUdroid launcher could be cool.)

It would be important that the entire set of apps share a design language and can inter-operate well. I don’t know if this idea has come up before but I think there’d be a real place for a meta-project like this. If I could replace all of the non-free software on my phone and tablet with a unified FOSS app collection I’d be a very happy man.

tl;dr Android's FOSS but most apps that people use on Android are not. We need a project like GNU or GNOME to develop and sponsor a collection of free apps for Android that can replace the non-free apps people use every day.

I do love Trisquel

With the recent ubuntu community issues, they've never actually taught its users about Free software or what it is (the social movement behind it nor philosophy). In a way, they've actually coopted the term 'free software"" to mean ""open source"" in a lot of peoples minds (i.e. the belief that there's nothing wrong with TPM software, if it meets the four freedoms than it's Free software). 

Of course, I've seen many say the same about mint, etc. but I haven't seen anything similar to a social contract or debians history from them). I think this may just be because those users feel slighted right now, but I also see an opportunity to teach too. As far as my understanding, Debian has always valued Freedom and has had goals that did not end with simply obtaining marketshare but I'm afraid the existing community may find themselves somewhat overwhelmed if they want to convey values to new users as well as welcoming them. Maybe, maybe not; Half of the reason for this post is to ask your thoughts on that?

RMS was visiting my university

First of
1. license
2. information how the user can get the source code.

Binary versions of almost all free software are available. That's convinient for the end user

Instead of taking this path and requiring some comment of specific format with a link to the sources and the license

The option would be much harder to adopt for a companies. Even if the company would like to endorse freedom

My proposed solution: in free javascript set some global variable
window.librejs = {license: ""GNU General Public License v2.0""

What do you think? Could we think of minified javascript as binaries? Or do you think that what libre.js is doing right now is a proper solution?

So then this DRM technology is introduced so that they can still base their business models on scarcity - if something is rare you can get a lot of money for it. This is done by having a ""black box"" computer program that only grants you certain types of access to the files/games and also enables the company certain types of privileges (e.g. upgrading or deleting it). [N.B. those old games that required the CD to play aren't considered DRM]

And I think what you described as optimal is possible: They could build a system that restricted certain actions (like copying the files to another computer or over the internet, but instead we'll be at the mercy of computers.

My ideal would be that people distribute freedom-respecting software and put legal restrictions on it (like make it illegal to distribute it over the internet). [analogy warning] DRM to me seems like doing a retina scan on anyone that wants to drive a car

1338847351.0,uky5l,Clarification needed for jobs supporting free software,,2,2,0,"The FSF claims that the majority of the developer positions are free software jobs. This is because that the majority of the distributed software comes from a minority of the companies and that the overall majority of software is not distributed to another party (private software).

Would you agree that we know that:

* free software operating systems are not in the majority. Most job offers will ask for knowledge of a propertary operating system.

* the majority of companies ask you to sign a non-disclosure agreement if you are to develop software for them

* the definition of in-house software can mean that the organization holds the copyright over that software and you will violate their copyright if you copy it for other projects.


If these are truths or untruths is there an easy way to help identify a free job from a non-free job? Maybe profiles of people working in related positions would help.",,t5_2qh3i,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/gnu/comments/uky5l/clarification_needed_for_jobs_supporting_free/
