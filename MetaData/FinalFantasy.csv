1358829261.0,171cbs,Dear r/FinalFantasy....,partytillidei,311,46,71,"
When I was a teenager I was the only person in my neighborhood playing Squaresoft games. Final Fantasy 2 and 3, Secret of Mana. These were games that I treasured but I never really had anyone to share my love for them, most of my friends were playing Street Fighter or Mortal Kombat (both great games too). Now I am all grown up and I see the RPGs that I spent my teenage years playing werent just a hobby that I played alone. There are millions of us. 

In college I identified myself with the ""nerd"" crowd but I still felt like I didn't fit in. They knew every single quote from Star Wars

I remember being bored in class and drawing my own little ""world map"" in the back of my notebook with my favorite towns from Squaresoft video games placed throughout the world

But I just want to say THANK YOU, I saw people cosplaying as Kefka at Comic Con and quoting him, and now I see you guys on r/FinalFantasy debating, quoting, painting, laughing with, and just praising the greatest video game series of all time. 

I just want to say thank you for making me feel normal. :)

1374771999.0,1j1dsh,My girlfriend and I notice something awesome about the beginning of Final Fantasy IX.,Galwither,144,44,40,"I thought this subreddit would appreciate this little story...

My girlfriend and I recently started playing Final Fantasy IX. She has never had any interest in video games whatsoever, but the beautiful images and how the story is presented to the player piqued her curiosity. I made some dinner for the both of us, and we started playing.

We then got to the part of the game where you play as Vivi for the first time, and we came across this little rat-boy. He said he would help only if I became his slave. My gamer instint said to just say yes, but my girlfriend said ""No I don't want to be that little thing's slave."" So out of curiosity I declined his offer and he ran off and left us alone. We spent the next twenty minutes exploring the plaza talking to people, and trying to find a way to get into the play, but to no avail. Then we made a discovery about the game. She looked up at me as I was running back through the plaza and said ""I'm so lost and confused."" Then it hit me like a ton of bricks. Here in this game we have Vivi (Tumpkin) who is an outcast in a world that doesn't seem to care about him because of his differences, he is ""lost and confused"" and the game had succeeded in making us feel the same emotion that this little pixelated mage was feeling. We looked at each other in awe of what a simple video game could do. She smile at me, and said ""Ok, can we keep playing? I want to see what happens."" So we continued playing,self,ff6-edgar3

-Any of these items marked ""optional"" are just extra game mechanics that are available. 

-Make the attacks make sense,"" she shouldn't be able to move or attack until the shuriken comes back to her).

-Final Smashes do not need to be their most powerful attack from their respective FF game. For instance, can summon a (scaled down) Black Materia meteor by simply pressing and holding ""Standard B"". Also, try to make their Final Smashes something fluid (an attack they can just fluidly release after going above a certain percentage, instead of going after a smash ball, think Link's ""Triforce Slash"") and less one-hit-kill cataclysmic (make it powerful, but not this ***IS*** going-to-kill-everyone-on-the-stage,-possibly-multiple-times-once-I-release-it powerful)

-If a character has parentheses next to their name

-Finally, though many of them would make good editions, so feel free to do those if you're so inclined).

1365922928.0,1cbday,Observation while replaying FFVII with a grownup perspective,lilkuniklo,120,20,41,"I was just a kid when I fell in love with FFVII. Everything about it blew my mind. But I never expected that the characters would continue to resonate with me after all these years. I recently made that discovery when I started another playthrough

I didn't expect anything from this playthrough. Even though it's been 10 years since the last time I played it

Everything went as usual until I got to the part where Nanaki discovers the truth about his father's sacrifice. When the music swelled and Seto's statue started to cry, weeping. 

It was completely unexpected. I already knew this was coming

The scene with Nanaki and Seto really hit home what I've come to realize about my own dad over the years. I'm 26 now. I've only begun to understand the many sacrifices my father has made for me. I never appreciated his actions when I was younger and often took his kindness for granted. 

Now that I'm finally old enough to understand, slower, achier, and starting to develop health problems. When you're a kid, you think your father is invincible. Then you grow up and realize that he's going to die someday, and you start to have feelings of regret about not being nicer and spending more time with your old man when you were young and had all the time in the world. And you get feelings of guilt about giving him so much shit and saying mean things when you were an ignorant, unappreciative kid.

It took me a while to kind of ""process"" the emotions that the Seto scene stirred up in me. But

FFVIII was released in my native United States on 9/9/1999. I was 12 years old at the time

When the game came out, the FFVIII is a very heterodox FF. There's a number of departures from the series' standards; no MPs, no limit to summons per battle, enemies level with the characters, etc. But, I want to elucidate a bit on why FFVIII is close to my heart, and perhaps why it should be close to yours as well.

FFVIII is about love. A lot happens in the game's four discs, Yoshinori Kitase, and Tetsuya Nomura were trying to tell a story about love. I know that sounds really hokey - in many ways it is! 

Like I said earlier, one major heartbreak and, thankfully, a better understanding of what friendship is.

FFVIII is an important addition to the series because it helps unpack vulnerable feelings and tender moments. I'm not sure if gamers as a group or even RPG gamers specifically; are the best or most appropriate audience for a story about love, that other games (and other FFs) lack. Built on it's capacity to connect the very human experiences of loss, vulnerability, connection and (maudlin as it may be) love; to the broader ""epic story"" the FF game is expected to portray.

Final Fantasy X really is the best Final Fantasy yet

From the development of the characters, and even the small things such as the Al Bhed language, it is more than fair to say that this game was worth the 3 years it took to make. I've never played a game that had me so involved, like I actually CARED for these characters and I followed the story as if I was IN it. My only regret is that I can't play it over and over. 

I'm more than willing to discuss the game and your opinions as I fairly enjoy even just talking about this game

So here's an alternative, so 2-3 silence/dark attacks per encounter pose no problems.  And if you don't work on her strength right away, she's not likely to kill the target.  Bonus, you get to watch her moogle doll or Cait Sith run up to bap a fiend.

{ I would like to chime in here. I have been playing Final Fantasy since 1, (14 times for FF7).

And I would like to say I have no issue with FF15 being a ARPG. Quite frankly I don't understand why anyone would. Each FF is different especially after 10. 1-3 and 10 where the only TRUE turn based FF games. 4-9 had the ATB system which was not really turned based. It was a hybrid of some type. Then we have 11, getting even closer to the action side.

I just don't see the issue with the game being action based. It drives home the fact every FF is different. How many FF fans grew to like FF because of 7? 8? 10? and even 13? Yes even 13 brought a shit ton of new fans to the FF series. This is what makes FF so great. Each game appeals more to another person. For example

Now obviously I agree that the ""golden era"" games (6-9) were the best

In my eyes

Now before you go WTF you talkin' bout STF, you can move in 12's system, but the differences really end there.

The whole issue that Square had when going into 12 and beyond was that people were growing tired of the slow turn-based system of classic rpgs. To remedy this, the unique systems of 12 and 13 are just as fun.

For one thing, to me the system is like a symphony where you are a conductor and your characters are like the orchestra. There IS strategy, the game is not ""playing itself"". Essentially the system is simply put in place to make things move faster without the static, unrealistic looking battles of yore. You have sets that you create, (whether we're talking about gambits in 12 or paradigm shifts in 13) and they basically contain the move-sets you would use.

Now though

Now besides the battle system (I've loved them all since FF6 I have to admit the classic job system from 5 and 3 irks me) I don't mind the linearity. I guess going in I knew it would be linear so I didn't expect anything else. For me, I have a full handle on everything that's going on, and I'm ready to diverge paths about.

Needless to say I'm psyched to play 13-2 and excited to see where the series heads.

Finally, they change it up so much now-adays I just don't think that's a fair statement at all.",,False,self,t5_2qhdi,False,,

What particular aspect(s) do you dislike about each Final Fantasy title?,heymrk,71,14,115,"*Let's try and do this without the downvote brigade coming out. Without petty bickering over the best Final Fantasy or even which one you think is the best

*Remember

I'll go first:

* **FF1:** I really have nothing bad to say about this game

* **FF2:** You might think I'd say the leveling system, but because it was unique to FF2. My biggest problem with the game was the keyword system's interaction with the story. The keyword concept is pretty cool, but in the grand scheme of the story, it simply falls short. There's a reason I've only played through the game once-- because I continually get lost. Other FF titles, I can leave for a while and pick back up later on. This is not the case with FF2. If you lose your place in the story, it's hard to get back into it.

* **FF3:** I hate that if you want to play an official licensed version of this game, *really* want Square Enix to release a 16-bit version, a la FF Origins.

* **FF4:** Edward Damycan. I know he was made better in FF4 DS

* **FF5:** You can't go wrong with a job system game. While not quite as polished as FFT, you can beat the game with levels in the mid-30s to 40s. I think there's a scalability issue with this game. I would prefer to be in the high 60s by the end of the game. This is nitpicky, and the same degree of difficulty would be there regardless of the level, but just irked me personally.

* **FF6:** Hoo-boy. This is my favorite FF title. I love it for many reasons, but the rage system simply felt broken to me. I *love* blue magic/monster skills, but in more of a traditional aspect, like Strago's blue magic. Plus Strago's blue magic can't break the game, like a few of Gau's rages can.

* **FF7:** Here's where I think I'm going to get the wrath. I don't like the Cloud/Sephiroth dynamic. Is Cloud in love with him? Is it hero worship? Is it the Jenova cells? Is it unmitigated hatred? There's no concrete line in the game clearly defining why he's following Sephiroth. Is it all of the above all at once? Why does their relationship seem so creepy? Maybe that's the thing most people like about their relationship-- because it's ambiguous. It forces you to make your own judgments and keeps people discussing it

* **FF8:** This is my second favorite FF title. It's hard to pick something-- if anything-- wrong with this title. But I think I know what it is. I like magic. I mean, but I wish there were some way other than with Selphie and Quistis' limit breaks to use magic consistently. It's definitely more hack-n-slash than any other FF title because of the magic system, but I still like it. I just wish there was more of a way to use magic without depleting your stats.

* **FF9:** I don't like Necron. Sure, there was plenty of opportunity to introduce Necron in the final dungeon. Add some wall placards warning about the destruction of the crystal. It's not that hard. It's shoddy storytelling. Give at least *some* foreshadowing.

* **FF10:** I don't like Tidus. There's a lot of emotion wrapped up in that one. A lot of personal anxiety because of it. My dad wanted me to be the balls-to-the-wall football star he was in high school and college. I didn't want that. He berated me constantly because I didn't want to do pee wee football. I did track &amp; field (and even helped win a state championship), but to him, that was gay. The problem I encounter with Tidus is when I was 12 or 13, I simply told my dad to fuck off. Well, not with those words, but still. Tidus always pissed me off because he got all the way to adulthood without telling his dad where to shove it. I won't say my relationship with my dad is perfect, but now he respects me for the decisions I've made in my life. Tidus simply never manned up. Just grow a pair

* **FF12:** I really LOVE this game. It's my third favorite of them all. But my biggest problem with the game was how apparently absent Vayne was. We know he's amassing his power behind the scenes, Vayne was just chilling in Archades, waiting on his time to come. Why can't we see more of his descent into madness?

* **FF13:** The pacing. Sure

* **FF10-2:** Not a bad game. I'm not even going to say the problem is the super J-pop story. My problem is the tedious task of getting every single miniscule tenth of a percentage point in order to get 100% at the end. It drove me batty.

* **FFT:** The translation. I know it was fixed with *War of the Lions

**TL;DR**: *FF1,* GBA release. *FF4,* Edward. *FF5,* low level requirements. *FF6,* Gau. *FF7,* Cloud and Sephiroth. *FF8,* no magic. *FF9,* Tidus. *FF12,* translation.

-This time is different though. Knowing the outcome of the story, it makes so much more sense. 


My first time through, it was so fast paced. I went back through FF VII and found myself annoyed out how long battles were drawn out (still the story is stellar, epic), even with the ATB Active. 
I also, with a splash of every battle system combined, with the little annoyances of past titles, eliminated.

I didn't draw this conclusion lightly. I have been playing and enjoying since '92 with my first title being II for SNES (I got it when I got my SNES) and going back and buying the original two for NES.

On a side note, got 27 minutes in before I couldn't watch anymore) I somehow made that connection, but it's stuck now.  ",,False,self,t5_2qhdi,,http://www.reddit.com/r/FinalFantasy/comments/znee9/trying_final_fantasy_xiii_again_my_opinion_has/

So I'm playing through VIII

I'm [in the escape pod on the Lunar Base going through the sequence where Squall saves Rinoa while she's floating out in space](/spoiler).  Problem is, not allowing me to progress.

So for those of you who haven't gone through it, and a Save Point after.

I tried everything.

* Cleaning the disc  
* Cleaning the laser eye
* Setting the PS2 to Fast Disc Read Speed (by the way
* Dusting off my old modded PSX
* Using Toothpaste
* Copying the disc using error correction software
* Finding a video rental place near my house and taking it there to get professionally polished

Nothing worked.  I had ordered a new copy of the game (a greatest hits copy) from Amazon

Then I remembered something.  When I had first modded my PSX back in roughly 2001, I'm a bit of a pack-rat when it comes to burned discs.

I dug through the basement for about an hour, Disc 3.  I flipped it over, and my heart dropped.  

Scratched like a motherfucker. 

Nevertheless

I trek upstairs, then swap it before it fully loads) has gone missing in the time I'd been away.

I pull apart several pens trying to find one that has the strength and the size to work.  No luck.

So, sitting inches from the TV.  I take one of the pens, and prepare myself to hold the close-lid button down for the entire sequence.  

Each of the FMV's in the sequence plays, while my hand is going numb from the pressure I'm putting on the pen to hold down the button.

Here it comes.  [Rinoa wakes up.  The music changes

Five seconds go by.

Then it starts, and save the game.  

Just to be sure that it works

My fiancee, great?"" response when I recounted my struggle this weekend, but I figure you guys would understand better than she would.

Any of you guys have any similar stories?

**TL;DR:  Tried everything over the entire weekend to get a disc to play. After 2 days

1338355274.0,ubowc,On the subject of Final Fantasy XIII,,70,23,65,"In response to the poorly drafted Final Fantasy XIII post

The story of Final Fantasy XIII is rivaled only by a few, you meet more people, party grows, kill something, crystal, end game surprise"", you have an original story where 6 people of different walks of life (Much like V honestly) are thrust into each other by a seal on there soul, but for the good of the world. Also

Secondly, you must coordinate the party through job classes, and control your character while planning out which attack to use and if it will affect surrounding enemies as well. The amount of time taken for battles may annoy some people, but I believe its to ensure that your willing to take the time to beat the game rather than just play off and on in short bursts, so you can really get into the story. Plus, summons are quite a bit more fun to use, since every character has their own personal Eidolon reflecting themselves in some way

Third, with over 100 C'ieth Stones acting as side quests. It also does away with linearity for a while, even though it takes a while to reach this point. And while a true city isn't located in the game, the save points act as an interface for cities, giving almost all the basic utilities of the cities in older games, minus the Inn. Although it may turn a few people away, it doesn't mean the traditional mechanics are completely gone
