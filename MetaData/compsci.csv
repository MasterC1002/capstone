1375897218.0,1jwa5b,Computer Science: A Guide for Undergrads,smashstuff,426,59,165,"It's the summer

[Edit: I'm British so this guide will reflect that. Also

This guide uses a UK CS degree for examples but I'm sure most of it will be relevant wherever you are. It is probably more catered to those who are doing a CS degree because they actually want to work with computers

Also

**Working on campus and Dolly Parton**
Go to uni (campus) to get work done. It may seem obvious, and relax. And because of this, when you take a procrasti-break you're more likely to get distracted. At uni you have little other choice than to do work. 

Try to work 9—5 (10—4) five days a week. Getting into a routine really helps and is important around crunch time. You'll probably find you have more free time

**Prioritise your workload**
Prioritise how long you spend doing certain bits of work, it is a lot easier, and possibly more rewarding, to do something you really enjoy, but it's worth bearing in mind that you need to focus on other modules as well.

**Chose another programming language**
The uni I went to taught Java as the main programming language. Now, I'd say something like C++ (or C) and Python. Not only will it give you more general programming experience, it also looks good to employers. Have a read around online, try a few out, and pick the one that you feel you want to use.

It is also likely that for your final year project you'll be able to use any programming language you want

And remember, and maybe not C++ either. I saw far too many people do this in my final year, and it's excruciating to watch when what has taken them two hours to get working can be done in five minutes in Python.

**Do projects in your spare time**
For those of you who know what you want to do after your degree, record some videos, and put them on youtube. If you want to do web development then make some websites for a few friends and get them online. The reason I suggest this is that when it comes to applying for jobs you'll easily stand out. If an employer is looking at 10 applications from recent CS grads and one of them has shown to be putting in effort outside of their degree, then they're going to be at the top of the pile.

If you don't know what you want to do after

**Your first year**
The first year is for having fun. Go out and party, drinking beer, and whatnot.

However, or you want to look for jobs in the summer, then being able to prove your academic performance is important.

I thought I'd mention this as an aside. If, or are worrying about, conversing with “normal” people, i.e. those who do humanities degrees, you needn't worry. I found that people who do CS are a far more accepting bunch than most, and you will meet plenty of people who don't care that you're a little “weird”.

**Commenting code**
When it comes to code-based coursework, consider following code guidelines and documenting standards. If you're wanting to get a job where software will be your main thing, then getting into best habits will really bode well.

**Technical Reports**
Reports seem to confuse a lot of people who do CS. Although many of us are happy writing code for hours on end, and you, can be sure you've understood it properly. Plus, they'll catch out a few people who have used Freelancer for their coursework.

As for general tips. Don't use 'I', and don't bitch and whine about using LaTeX. No, people who write normal software in normal CS jobs don't use LaTeX to write reports, but that's not the point. It's something you have to do and it really does look better than Word. 

Also

**Exams: everything
You need to know everything for exams. A degree is not the same as GCSEs or A-levels. You can't just learn what has been in the past papers and expect to do well. You may know people who had revised using past papers and they did extremely well

**Look at jobs early**
Start job hunting in the summer before your final year. I say this because it gives you enough time to get further experience and to do stuff that will greatly help you in getting a job. You don't have to actually be applying for jobs (although you will for graduate schemes)

**Final thoughts**
Try and use all of Windows, and as a CS person you *really* should know how to use each.

Learn about how computers actually work. As in the CPU, memory, scheduling, et cetera. I found this has not only given me a better understanding of computing in general, but it's another vast area of CS that can be explored.

Use the library and electronic resources. My uni spent £1000 per student per year on subscriptions for journals and new books. Before you buy that £60 book that you may only read twice

And for a small minority of you: make sure you wash. Seriously. Also, or your clothes.

In that post were references to the following three pieces of software that started what we now know as **Teh IntarWebs**:

    /pub/WWWNeXTStepEditor_0.12.tar.Z    NeXT application + sources 
    /pub/WWWLineMode_0.11.tar.Z          Portable Line Mode Browser 
    /pub/WWWDaemon_0.1.tar.Z             Simple server 

The editor/browser is preserved on many sites, which I feel is a _real_ tragedy. From snooping countless ftps with anonymous access, I can conclude that v 2.08b and upwards are widespread and easy to be found (both apache and w3.org have copies on their public ftp), but I have yet to find anything that predates that. 

Reddit! You have saved kittens, so generations to come will know where it all started.

1358353161.0,16ov26,Invited to talk to a 3rd grade,EricFrederich,250,45,296,"Hello /r/compsci

My wife is a 3rd grade teacher and I have a computer science degree... this day was inevitable.  She asked me to speak to her classroom.

Looking for some help with ideas of things to talk about.

This is what I have floating around my head so far....

Basically
When the users interact with the program by moving a mouse, shaking or tilting their phone.... someone with a degree like mine wrote the instructions behind it that make your computer do what it does.

Then as an example of a programming task I was thinking about introducing them to the Bubble Sort algorithm.
Obviously I'd make the algorithms / recipes analogy so the word algorithm doesn't throw them off.
I'd also explain the many reasons why you'd want things sorted in a computer... for obvious reasons
Surely they could understand finding song they want to play from a sorted list
I would start by explaining the algorithm in English (possibly side by side with pseudocode or Python).
Then I would act it out with pieces of cardboard...re-arranging them on the blackboard.

Perhaps afterwards I'll have 10 kids stand in line facing the class each holding up a number.
I could then have another kid act as the CPU telling the other kids what to do.
I'm not sure about them acting it out... I'll have to ask the wife if she thinks they'd be able to handle it.

I'd finish it off showing them the youtube video of the hungarian folk dancers performing Bubble Sort.

Do you guys think this is a good idea?
Any suggestions or comments are welcome.

(thought experiment),Cortexelus,212,46,74,"*This isn't an ethical question (though ethics are important to think about). This is a technical question to get people thinking about 1) computational stylometry of code

Hypothetical situation: I am a programmer working on proprietary algorithms for a big software company. I love my code so much, I am contractually obligated never to share anything I've written for my company. Many programmers are in a position like this. Many programmers also independently discover algorithms similar to proprietary ones, to which they are free to attach GPL licenses. 

I am looking for a way to publish my code without getting in contractual or legal trouble. I wish to obfuscate code such that it raises reasonable doubt that code came from me and not some other hacker working on the same problem. I could re-write it from scratch. OR (my main point here) I could write an algorithm which mutates code

There are algorithms for determining (to a degree of confidence) the authorship of pieces of writing using n-gram maximum entropy models. A similar approach could be used to figure out the author of code. If we all have unique styles of coding

Where are the legal boundaries here? When does my code become so different that I can publish it with a different license? **When am I no longer plagiarizing myself?** Do I even need to obfuscate my authorship? Is it fine so long as it looks like I wrote it from scratch? 

How does one fake a clean room design? How confidently can one test a clean room design for authenticity?

**TLDR; How do we write an algorithm which can mutate code to look like it was written independently from scratch?**

Most of the jobs I see that require a CS degree appear to actually be asking for a Software Engineer. I'm concerned that this hurts everybody involved. SEs may be missing out on job opportunities that they actually are perfectly qualified for. Companies/customers/clients aren't getting software that is written by an engineer, but are being pushed by markets and their departments into software development jobs that don't match their training.

It's been six years since I've taught the class and I have lots of ideas for improvements.  When the students finish the course

**What source and target languages should the compiler translate between?**

The three options I'm currently considering are:

* A simple source language (probably a C++ subset) compiled into x86 assembler code.  This is the classic approach and would allow more class time spent focused on the details of the lexer and parser.
* A slightly more complex source language compiled into a simple virtual assembly language.  I've used this approach before
* A source language (with proper typing, I haven't seen any that handle the canvas well.  Plus the students would learn more javascript and produce a compiler that I can imagine them (or me!) using again.

Other ideas would be appreciated. I am especially interested in the students implementing compilers that they might want to use again such as in #3.

**Which languages and packages should we use to implement the compiler?**

All of the students should know both Python and C++.  In the past I've used C++ along with flex and bison

I've also considered using the website HackerRank.com for the projects to allow the students to use a language of their choice with near-instant feedback and easy grading.  It would also allow anyone else to step through these challenges on the web.  The downside is that the students would be limited to a single file with no external tools or libraries

**How can group projects be done well?**

Most students hate group work, I find that I either crystallize my ideas or I realize why I'm wrong (or both!)  Second, having ~15 projects to grade rather than ~45 means that the TA and I can spend a lot more time per project to give useful feedback.  Finally, my experience is that groups allow me to give slightly bigger projects (I typically aim for ~1.5 times as big for groups with 3 people) and still get higher quality results in the end.

The downside to groups is, which is difficult to grade fairly.  I can require them to maintain a repository, but that still only tells me who committed code, not how much paired programming was going on, who put in the efforts to design different sections, etc.

So

**A few final notes:**

* There will be 45-50 students in the class.
* All students will have access to linux machines
* I am going to try a ""semi-flipped"" model of instruction where a large portion of class time is spent coding
* I'll e-mail those students planning to take the class to tell them about this post
* Both the TA and I will independently do all of the assignments before they go out to the students.  Ideally I want to try to do them all before the semester begins to make sure they fit together optimally.

Thanks!!

**Update 1:** Yes

**Update 2:** Thanks for all the ideas.  I think my next step is to do a bit of coding and get a better feel for the options.  It's been a while since I've worked with x86, probably with flex and bison for the sample code, but I'll also try coding up a recursive descent parser myself before locking that in.  As for groups, I'm tempted to build a flexible system where larger groups have slightly more work, but I suspect that's going to be more complicated than I'll have time for.  We'll see how putting such projects together works out.  Either way, I will expect groups to produce (brief) weekly progress reports that make it clear how everyone is contributing.",,,,

&gt;(or:  How to Design and Implement Programming Languages)
&gt;
&gt;Today's programming languages give programmers unprecedented power and
&gt;flexibility
&gt;many occasions when it is possible to encode the solution to a
&gt;programming problem in an existing language
&gt;significant effort
&gt;maintainability.  In these cases
&gt;problem is to develop a new language that makes the solution easy to
&gt;express correctly
&gt;languages range from ""little"" ones like Make, YAML, Wiki,
&gt;bash, etc., to ""big"" ones like Perl,
&gt;Python, JavaScript, R, MATLAB, etc.  All of these languages
&gt;were invented because existing languages just weren't good enough
&gt;in the course of your career
&gt;invent a new programming language!
&gt;
&gt;CMSC 430 is being revised in Spring 2012 with this context in mind.
&gt;The goal of the redesigned CMSC 430 is to arm students with the
&gt;ability to design, to
&gt;help solve programming problems.  Throughout the course
&gt;design and implement several related languages
&gt;parsing, compilation to bytecode,
&gt;type systems
&gt;
&gt;Students who wish to take CMSC 430 must have received a grade of C or
&gt;better in CMSC 330 and have permission of department
&gt;graduate student.  The course work will consist of 5-6 challenging
&gt;programming projects, and a
&gt;final exam.  Students should expect the programming projects to
&gt;require significant effort (but to do cool stuff!).
&gt;
&gt;Topics (exact topics TBD):
&gt;- GLR parsing
&gt;- Abstract syntax trees,
&gt;  control-flow graphs
&gt;- Syntax-directed translation, bytecode languages
&gt;- Dataflow analysis
&gt;- Type systems
&gt;- Memory management
&gt;- Optimization
&gt;- Register allocation
&gt;- Advanced topics

My name is Matthew Kaminski, William Molineux, and Solomon Davies.  While doing some standard archive work, I came across a letter written by Bostonian, Preacher and Freemason William Gordon.  Hidden in the bottom of the letter and the lining of the envelope was a complex cypher, easily the most complex I've ever seen the Masons use.  I sent a copy to Tufts History Professor Benjamin Carp, who expressed interest but was unable to help me crack it.  This code is interesting because, in later years, I know more about Boston masonry than most Post-graduate historians.  William Gordon was a loudmouth, in case the first one didn't work:

It's usually just a matter of me having to get my logic unscrambled, trace simple things out, etc.

I'm hoping it's just an issue of practice

Is this something I can adapt to with more experience or may I not be mentally fast enough in the sense of living up to the standards of a software development career?

I got A+ in my classes. I could implement and use data structures efficiently. I understood the algorithms presented to me. But I feel this wasn't/isn't an accurate measurement of my problem solving skills.


When presented with *new* algorithms or problems I have never encountered before


I've even bought books (Cracking the coding interview). I can't solve many of the problems they present. I have to read the solutions



I've also worked on several projects related to web programming (creating user systems, Winsock) and how they work. I rarely ran into having to implement or solve a puzzle type algorithms (maybe it's because I never got into doing advanced AI?) It's all been about understanding how a specific technology works. And if I had to use something complicated, I just used libraries which already implementing what I had to do.

**tl;dr - got good grades and understood all concepts in comp.sci. courses. Have had plenty of non-academic programming/project experience. Have read books on algorithms. BUT I still suck at them if presented with one I haven't previously seen the solution to.**

So does anyone have any tips on improving my algorithm skills that doesn't include trying to solve them and looking up a solution when I fail? 

*****
Thanks for all the advice. I really appreciate it. I'll start working on ""easy"" problems and go at them until I get at least a brute force solution. From there I'll try and clean up my code/solution. I'll try not to resort to looking at solutions in the same 48 hours of having started a problem at least.

Earlier today I asked my teacher in Database design why we haven't used any auto incremented integer primary keys(surrogate keys) in the course. I have done a decent amount of development and this is my first course in databases so I am naturally influenced by less than optimal design choices from being self taught. 

His response was that he thinks surrogate keys are harmful and should be avoided as much as possible

His selling point for using natural keys

This sparked my interest and I started reading some more about it on the internet. Overall the general opinion seems to advocate using surrogate keys while a smaller number of people argue that PKs should be natural if the attribute chosen is already some kind of identifier e.g part number

The requirements for a primary key are:

* It should be non NULL
* It should be minimal 
* It should be stable over time

As you might have guessed my teacher did not succeed in convincing me that natural keys are the way to go

I see several problems with natural keys that far outweigh the pros. A natural key is duplicated in many places and since it involves business logic there is a very real chance that it will change value over time which means it has to be updated in every single place it's used as a reference

My main point how ever is that I really cannot think of any natural keys that are stable enough to be used safely. 


So /r/compsci  what is your opinion?  Do you know of any material advocating natural keys ?

TL;DR
Surrogate or Natural keys?

Lectures and assignments are an exercise in deciphering obfuscated notation. It takes what seems like hours upon hours upon hours to prove or state something, but is this all there is?

Computer science is *not* just programming. Programming is an application of computer science. I get that. But what is computer science really made up of then? Oodles of formal notation?

So I guess what it boils down to is this: something that has been a longtime interest of mine is starting to feel flat, if I am still laying the bedrock for a greater understanding of a really thought-provoking field, I'd hate to jump ship when I'm almost there.

---

The wav file is sampled at some kHz rate in 16-bit PCM data format. So I take the FFT of both the reference and the sample. Then I try and find out how ""similar"" the shapes of the FFTs are by splitting up the sample and reference into some fixed number of regions and comparing the total power (i.e. x[n]^2) per region b/w sample and reference. The differences in power per region give me an error vector

I should note that for the signals I scale them appropriately by doing x[n] = x[n]/max(x[n]) and I make sure the FFTs are of the same length (if one sample is longer

The reason I split the x[n] signals (with N samples) into a number of regions (say, so I allow for some shifting in frequency to not affect the score - the leeway created by the 32 regions. Also, when comparing the differences, I allow region i to compare to region i-1 and i+1 and pick the lowest possible difference score.

I'm a female (not sure if it matters

I decided to pursue CS for a few reasons. When I first discovered the field after taking a career test in high school I asked my sister's boyfriend at the time, though, and ultimately why I chose to pursue it is because of my father. He wasn't a programmer, so I never had the good fortune of learning from an early age, but he did work with computers a lot, and showed me everything he knew about them, and even taught me how to build one from scratch when I was 10 years old. I completely lost contact with him after my parents divorced and in a way I feel like I'm preserving his memory by learning something we were both so invested in.

Now, I've felt like I was far behind some of the other students (namely, those who have been programming for years). 

I started college in the second ICS introductory course because I received credit from AP Comp Sci in high school

I'm hesitant to run to the bookstore and grab language books by the handful then sit down for a nice read

Edit: Wow! Thanks for the responses guys
To answer a few questions, this quarter I hit the ground running and I fell a little behind because I was sick for the majority of the first week, but still feel okay. 

I had considered learning XNA C# from some online sites and screwing around by writing my own game or something. Good/Bad idea?

I don't currently find any of these skills useful as no one is looking to pay me to create a program they can run in a console... 

I also noticed that most employers of interns are looking for either Python/Django experience or Java/Javscript experience... So what the hell am I doing with C++??

Step 1: A preliminary check: The algorithm parses the string to see if it violates any required word rules or contains any known, it can be considered invalid). If it passes this step, proceed to step 2.

Step 2. Here's the rough

The game's ""list of valid words"" is stored in the form of 26 TREES with 26 NODES FOR EVERY PARENT: one NODE per letter.

As you go down from the ROOT node

- 26 child nodes of its own

- a list of the valid words that start with the letters of the nodes visited so far. For example,"" : [category, catharsis, catfish, etc.]. 

Basic node structure:

		A			B			C
	[A	B	C]	[A	B	C]	[A	B	C]

For example: 

If we were trying to play the word


1. Perform the preliminary check for the word ""cat."" Cat is a valid word (has a vowel
2. Find length of word. Length of cat is 3
3. Descend from C to A
4. Descend from A to T
5. Look at node object for 'T': check the list of valid words that start with 'CAT'. If 'CAT' is found in the list (which it obviously would be)
//Just to continue the example: if the word was ""CATX"" instead of ""CAT"" the algorithm would continue on here:
6. Descend from C to A to T to X
7. Look in X's valid words list. 'CATX' is not found in the list of valid words for words that start with 'catx.' Error is thrown. (In an optimized structure

Does this look like it might be right? This tree-structure to store the words and perform the check? Any other ideas?

TL;DR: I propose that the game ""Words With Friends"" quickly checks word validity by comparing the entered word against a tree-like structure. What do you think?

I'm doing what would be called a major in Applied Math with a minor in Statistics over in America. I decided to self study algorithms just for the fun of it. I got *Introduction to Algorithms* by Cormen for cheap and started going through it. Whenever randomised algorithms were discussed however they only presented results on the expected value of the running time. Googling seems to suggest that this is the case in general.

My point is that wouldn't it be very useful to know the variance? I can think of the following reasons to know it:

* It gives you a measure of how much variation there is in the running time (obviously)
* You can estimate the total running time for running the algorithm many times by using the central limit theorem. For example this could be useful if a non-randomised algorithm calls a randomised one many times (more formally Ω(1) times with a large enough constant) inside a for loop
* If you are trying to do an experiment  to find the constants hidden by the Big-O notation

IPython adds some additional features to Python that make programming in Python even easier.  Not only does it show you the documentation string (doc string) for a function as the function is typed

More importantly though since, videos or even views to external sites, and it renders LaTex as well.  A typical IPython program looks like [this](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/raw.github.com/temporaer/tutorial_ml_gkbionics/master/2%2520-%2520KMeans.ipynb) and more can be found [here](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/wiki/A-gallery-of-interesting-IPython-Notebooks).  You can post your own notebook online for free at [nbviewer.ipython.org](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/).

An additional advantage of using a language that runs in a browser is that it is easy collaborate with others by using sites like [wakari.io](https://www.wakari.io/).  Wakari.io is a site that lets you run on a  private cloud on an Amazon EC2 machine.  There is a free tier just so you can try it out.

In IPython there are extensions such as the [physics](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/wiki/Extensions-Index#physics) one that let you work with units attached to your calculations.  You can see more about the extensions and how you make your own [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/IPython/comments/1ddpa5/like_firefox_and_chrome_ipython_has_extensions/).

I see the connection between CS results and mathematical theorems, as a result of which, I didn't consider them universal truths. Please do note that I'm only a beginner and my definition of 'universal' might greatly differ from yours. I don't consider mathematical theorems universal because their axioms can always be altered, leading to other truths (stuff like hyperbolic geometry, for example).

They always contain an even number of elements. Those elements have an numeral type with a strict weak ordering. The elements are sorted, if the data structure contains the elements [2,5,6,8], they represent the set [2,3,6, the second one is the first that is not in the set anymore. The principle can be (and is often) extended to non-integral types.

Typical operations run on them are boolean operation between two of them, this query can be done in logarithmic time, in a list it takes linear time. Other operations that change the structure can be done ""in place"" if it's a list, but not (efficiently) if it's a vector in the general case.

There are variations (like allowing an odd number of elements to denote that infinity is inside the set and adding a bool that ""inverts"" the set

Those data structures can be found with a lot of different names. Just to name a few different ones

- interval list
- disjoint sorted interval list
- multi range
- range set
- multi nail

Since this kind of data structure can be helpful in a number of problem domains

- If not

If there are collisions using the first TinEye way, and then again using some TinEye like reduction.

runtime - O(n)

it can also be done recursively

    int poweroftwo(int n) {

Is this actually constant running time? or is it still a linear running time because it takes n iterations to move n bits?

2. Learn C. Haven't really done any low-level stuff.

3. Algorithms. I took an algorithms class

4. Machine learning 5. Natural language processing. (These seem interesting)

6. Set theory and databases (My job next year will be working with databases)

Computer science is the study of the theoretical foundations of [information](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information) and [computation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computation)

[Computer Science](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science) is largely focused on conceptual constructs that make it essentially a subset of Mathematics. In contrast, is the managing of production computer systems.


Theoretical Computer Science is the fundamental basis for Computer Science

* Computer Science Foundations includes areas that often overlap with Mathematics. Fields include [Logic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_logic), [Graph Theory](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_theory), [Type Theory](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_theory), and [Category Theory](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category_theory).
* [Computational Theory](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_computation) deals with [Computability](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computability_theory_(computer_science)) (Undecidability, Complexity Classes, including P and NP). This where Computer Science really starts - answering the questions of what can be computed and what can be effectively computed.
* [Algorithms](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithms) and [Data Structures](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_structures) and their [analysis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis_of_algorithms) (Big O Notation) builds on top of Computational Theory

Applied Computer Science is concerned with higher-level fundamental computational system constructs.

* [Compiler](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compilers) and [Programming Language](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_languages) Design concerns itself with a special type of computational system
* [Operating Systems](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_systems) topics include aspects like Memory Management
* [Computer Graphics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_graphics) is a large field
* [Database](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database) topics include various models (relational
* [Cryptography](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptography) is the study of hiding and protecting information

You are reading data records off a stream. You don't know how long the stream is or when it will terminate. You should treat it as a stream of infinite length with elements in random order. Your job is to maintain a current list of maximum top k records as elements are read off the stream

I remember the solution required a buffer where:

    buffer length = 2 * k

I believe it was a variation of a divide and conquer algorithm but only goes 1 level deep

You could also do this with a type of min/max heap but that would be O(n log **k**). That's not good enough. We want O(n).

I've always considered myself to be an above average programmer (in comparison to most of the other sophmores studying Comp Sci at my college). One of my current computer science courses is ""Algorithms / Data Structures"". The big change to this from my previous courses, we are able to use whatever programming language we choose to complete the assignments.

My real question is do you have any advice for conceptually setting up an algorithm and program? Tips or ways of approaching that work for you? To be honest

Hope I didn't make that confusing. Any suggestions or advice would be greatly appreciated. Thanks guys!

Just want to post this in case anyone is looking to take on a big

------------------------------------------------

The academic publishing industry is archaic at best

Below is our solution to this problem. It would be a huge undertaking to create it and we don’t have the requisite skills/time to do so. We just want to float it on the web so someone else might pick it up and start the process of making it a reality.

Crowd-sourced ratings systems, including introduction, methods, results, conclusions, limitations, etc. Peers will evaluate these manuscripts by the same criteria that are used today. Diverging from today, rather than by 3-5 anonymous “experts” requested by the manuscript’s author or selected by the journal’s editor. Non-anonymous researchers will evaluate the manuscript for quality/importance, their visibility will increase as they’re targeted to “high value” lists, and each author will be linked to a historical research profile. Each manuscript/comment score is factored into a historical user score

In the end, includes relevant critical commentary traditionally seen only by authors, eliminates the “third reviewer” phenomenon, rewards authors with novel ideas without regard to institution/financial/ backing/geography, and overcomes problems documented at the polymath project. It would have completely open access. It would eliminate submitter/reader fees, freeing information to all. It would have other perks, but you get the idea.

We envision this system laid out in a three-tier system with a “dashboard” type user interface. The “bottom” level of this system would include all data sets. Datasets would include relevant epidemiological characteristics. Datasets would be linked to citations of data within articles that’d identify which pieces of data, though the dataset used might not be new. An independent user might identify something novel in a dataset not identified by the original dataset poster, and he/she could create a separate manuscript from it, giving full credit to the original submitter with data-links. Original posters would be rewarded each time a dataset was used successfully via historical user scores mentioned throughout this article (encouraging submission of data for community processing). This system would reward transparency and thoroughness at original submission.

The “middle” level of the system would include manuscripts and their associated comments. We envision this level being a split screen, multiple manuscripts, and outside sources to be viewed simultaneously for cross-referencing). Users could read new manuscripts, give them a rating, and leave comments with citations in the form of discussion here. Comments could address issues with new manuscripts, or the data underlying new manuscripts, directly. Consequently, new information would be disseminated as a novel dialogue, good manuscripts/comments would float to the top via a strong score

The “top” level of this system would be an information synthesis similar to Wikipedia. This level would allow users to cite and synthesize information from manuscripts and comments (as well as, as all discrete information at this level could be linked directly to relevant manuscripts/comments discussing it, making “truth” easily linked to primary sources. Again, users would be credited by the user algorithm for their contributions here.

Underlying this process is an algorithm accounting for the spectrum of user contributions. A user’s individual score would account for all of his historical contributions to the project, constructive comments left, and datasets submitted. Credentials (appointments, higher education, etc), similarly, could be accounted for in the individual user score. Value associated with comments he/she leaves on other manuscripts would take historical user score into account, new manuscripts submitted by a user would receive higher/lower baseline ratings based on historical contribution. We envision this score being included on academic curricula vitae

The beauty of this system is that it allows complete transparency while offering each user a historical rating assigned by his peers. It would include translation software, discipline, user score underlying a new manuscript, “hot’ manuscripts receiving a lot of attention from readers/commenters, country/state/neighborhood of origin, etc. It would facilitate streamlined and effective literature searches, allowing users to search for key words across the entire body of scientific knowledge, rather than processed data from ""peer-reviewed"" articles. It would eliminate siloed departmental research by opening commentary to all disciplines and encouraging interdisciplinary collaborations. And much

This system could be supported financially by grants, his/her search and review history would be available, his biographical sketch posted, his discipline noted, advertisers would have a wealth of information for targeting. For example, a device manufacturer selling pipette tips would know that user X recently posted a dataset in which 30,000 pipette tips were used. That company would also know that user X searched for manuscripts from users completing similar research. Consequently, many pipette tips and advertising could reflect this.

**The link [is here at a blog](http://rationalargumentator.com/issue195/godel.html) called the Rational Argumentator.**  The author appears to be a [mathematically trained independent scholar](http://www.quebecoislibre.org/apstolyarov.htm) now working as an actuary and philosophizing in his spare time.  

(For an even more readable

**TL;DR**  : A few memorable quotes from the article that might help put Godel in perspective for some people :

1. *The concepts of consistency and completeness are purely syntactical concepts


2. *Gödel's incompleteness theorems do not pertain to systems which are not framed in the language of mathematics – such as political, economic, biological, and literary systems and bodies of thought. Virtually every such system is incomplete in the formal mathematical sense*


3. *Theories to which Gödel’s first incompleteness theorem applies cannot be described via a finite body of axioms*


4. *Gödel’s proof of the existence of true but unprovable statements can be applied not only to Peano arithmetic itself but to any system which gives one the capacity to assign Gödel numbers to statements. Such a system must be “expressive enough to define the set of natural numbers or develop basic properties of the natural numbers


5. *Gödel himself did not initially view his incompleteness theorems as defeating any of Hilbert’s program.... However,” eventually led Gödel to change his mind.*

6. *If von Neumann was right, “much work has gone into extended (or relativized) forms of Hilbert’s program using constructive though non-finitistic means for consistency proofs.*


7. *Gödel’s second theorem showed that the consistency of a system cannot be proved within that system. It is a common mistake


8. *In 1936,”with quantifier-free transfinite induction, “an extension of mathematical induction to well-ordered sets,”up to the ordinal ε0.*  My note: Primitive recursive arithmetic is any many respects *weaker* than Peano arithmetic.


9. *Gödel’s last published paper in the journal Dialectica gave another proof of the consistency of the arithmetical axioms in 1958*


10. *Gödel’s theorems do not pertain to the issue of the existence of an objective reality*


11. *Gödel… saw his incompleteness theorems not as demonstrating the inadequacy of the axiomatic method but as showing that the derivation of theorems cannot be completely mechanized. He believed they justified the role of intuition in mathematical research.*


12. *By showing some fundamental limitations to how the consistency of mathematical systems can be proved,False,,t5_2qhmr,False,,,t3_akof1

I think there could be tremendous value to the community in building a new resource: a spreadsheet/wiki of computer science faculty, hiring year, title, and schools they went to earn their prior degrees.

Why is this useful?

* Graduate applications: Students who want to apply to grad schools in Networking can immediately look up the active faculty in that area and their seniority (untenured vs tenured). It's also easy to see which universities have a presence in less-ubiquitous subfields like HCI or Information Retrieval.
* We can find out academic hiring trends for different subfields in computer science: which subfields have top computer science departments hired in the past 5 years? How was academic hiring affected by the economy?
* Department rankings: When DepartmentA hires a faculty from DepartmentB, US News, is [controversial](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_college_and_university_rankings_(North_America\)) because of it's based on subjective department chair surveys with poor response rates; this could be a USNews Killer, and include universities outside the United States.
* Tons of other stuff on CS trends

If we had complete listings for the top 100 computer science departments, or in faculty CVs and bios. This means if a couple dozen people contributed a few departments each, we'd have a complete listing by the end of the year.

Is this something people in this subreddit would be willing to contribute some time for? This could be a useful resource for the community

I'm a student of philosophy specialising in analytic philosophy - especially logic and ontology. Recently, which I have always found to be interesting but daunting. I love logic, and have an affinity for math as well. I have worked with, among other stuff, developing my own systems of modal logic for different concepts. So I guess my basic questions are: Is hardcore theoretical logic of use to computer science, and what are some ways to get to use my skills in logic within computer science? In other words - where do I start? As I said, I'm more interested in the theoretical aspects than in programming. Is it worth looking into computer science from such a viewpoint at all?

In the case of the closure, in the scope outside of the closure. It's mutable. After the closure is created, I could alter it's behavior by doing something like...

    $two = 3;
