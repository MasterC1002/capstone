1365624355.0,1c32wz,Surface Pro is amazing... and probably the most underestimated device out there.,babanz,109,9,77,"As I'm using it I'm coming to realize that:

- I can use it as a regular laptop just fine. It's more powerful than my 1-year old 15"" laptop (which was more expensive as well!).

- Touch integrates very well with general usage. Touch adds better manipulation.

- Battery has not run out during any of my trips. I've already been on a few flights and long commutes

- Surface fits everywhere (keyboard included)! Fits small airplane economy class tables just fine. Fits train seat tables fine as well.

- Even if heavier than the iPad... it's not heavy! It's comfortable enough to hold when walking around and sitting. I've used it multiple times to show other people features, some notes I've taken, ... it can get a little tiring if you are holding it with one hand for a long period of time, but it's the same with my iPad. I brought my Surface in the kitchen earlier and ordered my shopping online with it as I checked what I have left.

- OneNote is amazing. I find myself writing notes during my commutes and brain storm. I'm pretty impressed and I'm not sure what I'm going to do without it now.

- It's pretty easy to use the pen and write/draw while sitting on a couch or at a table

- Has reduced my flight hand luggage weight by at least a couple kg... some airlines just allow you 10kg on board. So that is pretty sweat.

- The full desktop applications I can use on the go is just amazing! Flip, ...

Endless possibilities... I think I'm not the only one here.

______

The only negative points I see are:

- Really hoping for WinTab drivers though... using Photoshop with the pen would really boost productivity of this device.

- When using it on my lap the inclination makes it hard to use it as a typing device when out and about. I wouldn't generally use it as a typing device in these situations anyway... I would just use it as  a tablet and use the onscreen keyboard (which is good enough).

- Additional battery would be beneficial... not absolutely necessary. Who doesn't want a 12+ hour powerful laptop on the go.

**These are my personal impressions. Your mileage may vary.**

The Bad:

* The only impression I've drawn thus far is that the display has quite the glare problem (I can hardly see what's on screen right now thanks to the sun behind me in spite of the brightness on max). 

* It is also quite heavy-feeling. Feels a lot heavier than the RT. The weight distribution also makes it feel quite a lot heavier than any other tablet I've held

* The pen feels really

* The new angle seems a bit weird. It isn't working for me on my desk unless I put it far enough away.

* The Touch Cover still delays when you switch from scrolling to moving the cursor. I was hoping they somehow fixed it.

* The power cord is ridiculously short. So much for charging it in a regular class without an extension cord.

* Speakers are still quiet but not horrible.

* It is starting to get a bit hot while charging. 

The Good:

* 89.4GB of storage space available. 

* The display resolution is great. Noticeably better than the 11.6"" 1080p panels.

* It's virtually silent. If you move close you hear a buzzing from the fans but in realistic use it is silent.

* It still has a superlative kickstand.

* It's not bad on your lap on the couch (though far from ideal the angle ends up totally wrong).

* Very quick and smooth. 

* All round great device. It is generally much more good than bad. The minor issues are easy fixes for another generation but this competes well with current Ultrabooks. I would easily recommend it over my old Sony Vaio Duo 11. 

* Much better scaling at 125% than the standard 150%.

Pros: 
1. Battery life. I can get literally 10-12 hours doing homework and listening to music on it.

2. Office 2013. Need I explain more?

3. SkyDrive integration. I have a desktop running Windows 8 and a Windows Phone 8 device as well. SkyDrive is flat out awesome. Type a paper on my desktop

4. Type Cover. I had the Touch and hated it. Got the Type and love it. I can type wayyy faster with much fewer errors.

5. Snapping. Running two apps side by side is also awesome. I can watch a video for homework and type notes on it at the same time.

Some cons I personally face:
1. Driver support. Some printers don't work. Fortunately the printer I had at home worked. 

2. No desktop apps. There are sometimes I wish I could just open the Command Prompt and use some of my own console apps. I also wish I could program on the Surface.

3. Lack of apps. However

4. I can't really think of a 4th. I'll update if I do.

1356636425.0,15j5p8,Got a Surface for Christmas - I really love this thing!,dngrCharlie,62,8,13,"I told my wife that a Surface was a ""low priority"" on the Christmas wish list because

So

Things I really like:

* The Touch Keyboard.  It is just so handy to use this thing in tablet mode to read Reddit and then flip the keyboard out when you want to reply to a post or add to a thread.  It is amazingly easy to do and it doesn't feel ""in the way"" when folded back like the Type cover does (at least to me!).  

I am also very comfortable typing on the Touch keyboard.  It does take getting used to but it is really easy when you do.  It is light-years better than typing on a virtual keyboard.  For example

*  I had to work things out but now I'm happy with the way the METRO IE organizes favorites. I was on the fence with regard to the fact that IE syncs with your other Windows 8 PCs because my desktop IE has a shit-load of favorites (imported from Chrome).  However

In other words, I really don't go to the Surface desktop (and really don't want to under normal circumstances).  

For frequently used websites (like Reddit) I have learned to just pin IE shortcuts to the Start page (at the very end of it) to get them conveniently placed in the browser shortcut section.

For things like HBOGo and YouTube that don't have dedicated apps yet

*  I love that you can us a gesture to go forward and back in IE.

*  I love how easy it is to go back to recently used programs and how east it is to close applications (unlike Android which is a pain in the butt to close apps).

*  The mail client is simple and is easy to use.  It is NOT full featured but good enough.

*  The Remote Desktop app is nice

*  I find the split keyboard the most comfortable to use when using the Surface on the couch.  I almost never use the Surface in portrait mode.  

*  The Charm Bar

Some things that I hope are coming:

1.  I wish IE would wrap text when you zoom into a page.  As you get older, Opera mobile, you can pinch out to make a page bigger and the text automatically wraps so you see it all on one screen.  I really miss this.  I know you can adjust the zoom but it is not convenient to get to (compared to pinching) and the text still goes off the screen making that not very useful.

2.  I wish there was a MOG and an Amazon Cloud Player app.  I know MS is pushing Xbox music so I hope they don't prevent other streaming services in their store.  

So, really like it.  I don't think I am going to want the Pro version as the RT seems to have really done a good job of balancing a normal tablet's functionality with just enough extra stuff (Remote Desktop, keyboard, Office apps) to let you get by very comfortably when you need just a bit more than a tablet normally offers.  Plus it's light and has good battery life!",,False,self,1356636780.0,t3_15j5p8

•Touch cover is taking some getting used to, so no issues there. Will have to practice with the touch cover.


•One awesome thing I noticed was that keyboard shortcuts like copy and paste work on the on screen keyboard as it has a control key right next to the space bar. VERY handy. I love this so much. The keyboard sound is the same dynamic tapping sounds from Windows Phone, nonetheless.


•I played around with the built in options for the keyboard, where its split, and then one that converts ink into text. The ink input works flawlessly, considering how abysmal my handwriting is, it just would not screw it up. I could see myself using that a lot actually, even with a capacitive stylus with how responsive the screen is (I use a jot pro). Very excited to test it out on the Surface Pro.


•Surprised at the lack of an official Facebook app, and quite beautiful, too.


•I opted for the 32GB model, as well as swap and windows/office installed. After installing some apps, etc, I'm down to about 16GB of storage, so that sd card can't come soon enough.


•Being able to plug in USB devices is really freaking cool. My laser printer worked no problem. Same with a wireless mouse. I'm a student in IT, so my data space needs are quelled by that handy little port.


•SkyDrive integration throughout the OS is a godsend. I'm a fairly heavy SkyDrive and Office user, though, as it improves performance and touch elements considerably.


•Side note: I accidentally pressed the back button in the browser and thought I lost all this

All in all I'm quite pleased with the device. The hardware, if not better - or different as they say. I've owned the first three generation iPads, and this device just seems so much better in all the little places, which is quite nice, indeed. Obviously the software selection is a little low right now, but that will most definitely increase over time. This is Windows after all. That said, there are already more useful tablet apps for my day to day use than on my Nexus 7. Android is already trailing this new platform in that regard, and its only been out for two days.

 Very pleased with this device. Still on the fence about selling this in January to put towards the Surface pro


 •Metro, and damn does this interface work well on a tablet. The gestures take a little getting used to, but once you get the idea of it, it makes the traditional iOS/Android interfaces seem downright dated. I've been using Windows 8 RTM via MSDNAA since early September on my desktop, so I'm already fairly familiar with a lot about the OS, which I suppose helps (and makes RDP kick ass).


•I'm excited to see how this will play with Windows Phone in the future. I own a 7.5 device, though, perhaps we will find out on Monday during their press conference.


•IE 10 is really awesome


•One thing I love about IE is the flip ahead feature, it allows you to ""drag"" the page to the left in order to advance to the next page rather than having to tap the small next link that is often at the bottom. Same goes for going back to the last page, just swipe it to the right. Very slick.


•As far as I can tell


•I like that pressing the capacitive home button makes the Surface vibrate. I also like that it wakes the device


•I forgot to mention the battery. It seems as good as my iPad, which took over 4 and half hours to fully charge.


•Multiple users is nice, so you'll have to buy them again for each account. Hopefully that is changed in the future, especially with the higher price of RT apps compared to their iOS counterparts.


•As far as the screen is concerned, though, the colours and contrast seem better on this screen than on the iPad

I bought this thing as my true replacement for my laptop. I'm fairly tech savvy for not being in IT and decided to jump into the surface cold turkey. I am an executive for a small business in the financial industry and I thought I would let you guys know my experience of using this thing as my main computer. To start, Second Screen (needed but not plugged in), and I'm using this in a corporate office environment. So far, email works seamlessly with our exchange server in New York. Excel is fine and so is the included Adobe reader app. I installed Adobe Reader touch, but didn't find any benefit over the included one. Today I plan on installing following: CSS5.5 design premium (Illustrator, Dreamweaver, Photoshop, and InDesign only) and Morningstar Office (this is an investment adviser software suite). 

As I go through the day and need to complete my normal tasks, etc. from real world scenarios. Also, if you have any questions, I will be glad to answer them. If interested, I will also post a picture or two of my work environment to give you an idea.

Edit: Day #2. I'll keep commenting if you're still interested. I installed Photoshop, etc. but neglected to tell me that the VGA adapter they sell only works with the RT....not happy. Those guys are notorious for lack of product knowledge. I should have known better.",,False,self,t5_2u5h1,1360687582.0,,

After i dumped my iPad and X220T combo when I got my Surface Pro, VERY seamless. It just so happens that I had 2x hardware-related failures with my iPhone 5 over the span of a month, having to get it replaced each time...so I thought, why not try out Windows Phone 8, especially since it integrates so well with my Microsoft account (SkyDrive, etc.), and I can tie it with my Surface in the same ecosystem?     


I played around with a Lumia 920 at an ATT store and was just blown away - I immediately made the switch right then and there, with my Surface Pro. It may sound like it was Windows 8 that drew me to WP8, but in reality, the desire to have BOTH of my ""mobile"" devices tied into the same ecosystem was the deciding factor in the long run (it's still weird to refer to a Surface Pro as a mobile device, since it's tablet/laptop hybrid, obviously).

1363111889.0,1a5rwt,Microsoft rolls out Surface (Pro and RT) Firmware Update for March,Apotheosls,42,6,62,"http://www.microsoft.com/Surface/en-US/support/performance-and-maintenance/pro-update-history

http://www.microsoft.com/Surface/en-US/support/performance-and-maintenance/rt-update-history

I was prompted to install the firmware update

According to the link

**Surface Pro update notes:**

March update

The March cumulative update includes improved Surface Wi-Fi reliability

- Fixes to Wi-Fi reliability allowing for better roaming and improvements to ""Limited"" connectivity scenarios.

- Windows To Go feature is enabled.

- Improved onscreen keyboard detection synchronization when going in and out of sleep.

**Surface RT update notes:**

March update

The March cumulative update includes improved Surface Wi-Fi reliability

- Fixes to Wi-Fi reliability allowing for better roaming and improvements to ""Limited"" connectivity scenarios.

- Resolves issues with integrated volume button.

- Improved Type and Touch cover typing experience on soft surfaces and when devices and keyboard are lying flat.

- Resolves issue with random muting.

- Trackpad performance improvements.

No mention of a fix for the ""brightness"" issue that some Surface owners are experiencing (haven't run into this myself fwiw).

**EDIT:** Not sure if it was just my Surface (Pro, and it's been over ~30 minutes.**

It has been sitting at this screen for the bulk of that time:

http://i.imgur.com/xo6CRu0.jpg

So, i noticed that the white LED on the power adapter is not lit up right now.

I'll edit this again once it's finished updating....

**EDIT 2:** I am now at the 1 hour mark

Pressing the power button does nothing. Holding down the power button does nothing. The Windows button gives a tactile feedback and does nothing. No combination of button presses/holds do anything....it seems like it's stuck and may just sit there until it's finished

No blinking LEDs

**EDIT 3:** I finally got it to hard reset holding the volume up + power buttons. It restarted just fine

I guess if anyone gets stuck at the update screen for any longer than 10-15 minutes

**EDIT 4:** To double check if your firmware was updated, &gt; kicks you to desktop &gt; choose Advanced Tools &gt; View advanced system details in System Information

The **""Embedded Controller Version"" should be at 5.01 if your firmware updated properly** (this is straight from Surface Support).",self,t5_2u5h1,1363117107.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/Surface/comments/1a5rwt/microsoft_rolls_out_surface_pro_and_rt_firmware/

Some more details on what I saw.  The screen was very bright and had good color contrast. I would say it was on par with the Acer S7 just a few tables down.  The pen interaction was quite good.

I purchased a surface RT a few months back.  Since I live in Hawaii

Well, opening up in a mall in Honolulu (ala-moana shopping center).  I don't normally go to the mall anymore but on a whim, I went a week ago.  I walked into the store (they're a bit too apple-copy for my preference) and started playing with their type keyboards.... I instantly fell in love with it.  The dreaded ""lag"" had definitely been fixed in one of the earlier updates and the tactile feel was fucking AMAZING. 

Anyway, kind of newbie (new store) but real nice.  I got to talking with some of them and they seem to agree as we (the actual users!) that windows RT is fucking GREAT, and that the negative reviews seem to be from people who have never TRIED to use it. 


Microsoft - if you're reading this please take note - I am NOT a brand whore.  I have a apple iphone (best apps, I plan on getting a PS4, and I've looked at buying a (gasp) MacBook Air instead of my Windows RT.  This is a NON FANBOY telling you, the windows RT platform is AWESOME.  You just need to push for more apps/games and this will be a game changer. 

I know you guys claimed some losses recently...but good lord, $800+ for a wallet I like, and waaay more money that I should've on watches, knives, lights...  

I am an extremely picky person with no brand loyalty telling you - The Surface RT is perfect.

--

I've always been a supporter of Windows 8 and Microsoft's new vision of computing. Even though I had never used a touchscreen before

It is hard to speak of groundbreaking ideas and shifts in this field, and more recently it has been regarded as only suitable for leisure and less productive tasks, I think that now we are beginning to tap into the vast potential of using touch interfaces in productive environments.

Microsoft's entry into this field is far from perfect

Today we see a very linear approach to touch interfaces

**Gestures** which provides access to advanced actions without requiring precision or screen space

**Contextuality** which provides access to data depending on what you need to see

And importantly, all without losing any productive potential of the program. The fact that touch interfaces haven't been suitable for productivity isn't because they're touch-based - it's because there hasn't been a good touch UI made yet.

And this is why Windows 8 is such an important entry in personal computing. Microsoft has created the foundation of the next level of touch. Their Metro UI (formerly Metro) design language promotes a removal of chrome and focus on the actual content - while preserving all functionality through contextuality. This is where I believe the future lies - even extremely feature-heavy programs like Photoshop can be adapted to touch computing through these guidelines

Of course one might ask - even if programs can work as good using touch interfaces as they can with a keyboard and mouse, zooming, navigating menus - without a middle man (the mouse), navigating becomes far more direct. Importantly, it also lays the foundation to make entirely new devices - just look at the flood of new Windows 8 hybrids that have hit the market since its release. These are just a few reasons - the downsides of touch interfaces so far have been lack of productivity, but as I have addressed above, this is changing.",False,,http://www.reddit.com/r/Surface/comments/19gg5z/why_microsoft_is_onto_something/

However, I decided to go with the RT. Here's my review: 

1. From someone who is used to using OSX, the whole side-swipe bar, control panel, etc. Quite frankly, it's not intuitively designed for someone to just ""get,"" unlike many Apple products.

2. Once I did learn how to use all the commands, etc., I think the functional design is better than any Apple portable OS. The screen seems less ""cluttered"" due to the search and setting functions having to be swiped in, and I absolutely love the method of switching apps. 
3. One small negative; deleting apps is too cumbersome
4. Little things that I like: YouTube still plays when another app is opened. Although there are less apps
5. Little things I don't like: Lots of garbage apps that just aren't functional. It doesn't work with my printer. Two setting panels; why is there a control panel
6. Netflix works great; I actually like it more than the Apple version as it's less cluttered. 
7. Sometimes, but I feel as though that is a problem with the app, not the device.

1368813570.0,1ej3xh,Mini review of the Bamboo Stylus Feel with the Surface Pro,Dacvak,25,3,15,"So I ordered a [Bamboo Stylus feel](http://www.wacom.com/en/products/stylus/bamboo-stylus-feel) for my Surface Pro a little while ago

Right off the bat, it's about the same weight as the Surface Pro stylus (""SPS"" for short), and with the cap adds a little extra. It's not only a matte finish (as opposed to the SPS, which is a glossy plastic), but it's a little rough like a fine-grain sandpaper, which feels amazing and comfortable.

The primary difference between the two styli is that the tip on the SPS is very smooth and rigid, without question, a dramatic improvement from the SPS, and really makes drawing more of a pleasure.

The second largest difference is the pressure-sensitivity of the pen, in my opinion. It takes probably double the amount of pressure to get from 0% to 100%, and since the tip is more flexible, that feels amazing. You end up being met with far more resistance when pressing on the screen with full weight, and it really helps with accuracy. Not to mention, it's now *much* easier to have consistent light presses (in the 0%-30% range) with the feel, as opposed to the SPS, which sometimes makes me sacrifice accuracy. This is a huge plus over the SPS

Another difference is the right-click button on the feel is flush with the pen, it's easy to find and easy to press. This is also an improvement, though I can't fault the SPS's right-click button since it doubles as a docking magnet, which I love. But when actually drawing, I greatly prefer the button on the feel.

There's zero noticeable difference in accuracy between the two styluses, but just like the SPS tends to skew a bit when dramatically tilted one way or another, especially when pointing in the corner of the Surface Pro. This is a bit disappointing, but it's to be expected.

A huge drawback to the Bamboo Stylus feel is the fact that it **does not** have an eraser like the SPS has. If you flip the pen around and hold it to your Surface Pro, this will definitely bug you.

However, because now I can just toss the stylus in my bag and not worry about damaging the tip, unlike the SPS. I don't know if the trade-off (no eraser/plus cap) is worth it for everyone, but I think if I had to have the choice, I'd keep the cap. The cap also has a very sturdy clip to attach to whatever. 

Overall

Hope this is helpful to anyone on the fence.",self,t5_2u5h1,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/Surface/comments/1ej3xh/mini_review_of_the_bamboo_stylus_feel_with_the/

1356760667.0,15m386,My Surface experience so far,jm24,26,3,22,"I like reading these posts because r/Surface users are the reason I ended up getting my Surface

I got the Surface RT, as it is just too wide to hold from one side. It is pretty fast and sure as hell beats using a regular tablet. It really is better to use the Surface, it feels less limited, because it's still Windows 8.

I have used remote desktop to my desktop and it's actually really freaking easy. Just type in the IP address and connect. Might be harder once they're not on the same connection.

The Surface also comes with a USB port. Wayyy more handy than I thought it'd be. After I built my desktop

With the Touch cover, the trackpad button(where you can click by tapping under the trackpad) seems a little ambiguous in terms of tapping it without looking down. Maybe just takes more getting used to.

The default apps are a little stale feature wise, I use the Surface to develop using Visual Studio remote debugging tools  for my new Google Talk app, and it works fairly well.

I have experienced some problems

Second issue is here http://www.reddit.com/r/Surface/comments/154ccy/90_available_plugged_in_not_charging/. At first I thought it was a feature

Microsoft easily exchanged both of these, and you have 14 days, why you not send it back?

1361300735.0,18u093,A week of Surface Pro: My impressions,ximplosionx,23,2,50,"I think after a week of using my Surface Pro as my primary computer I can give a good breakdown of my thoughts on what Microsoft has done with these devices.

The Great:

* VaporMG: I've never seen a device feel as solid or as sturdy as the Surface. I think this is likely because of VaporMG

* The Screen: Beautiful

* TypeCover: Best keyboard I have ever owned. This may be because I've never spent more than 30 dollars on a keyboard

* Microsoft Support: The most professional and caring support team I have worked with in the last five years. I've had to work with Asus and Lenovo, which I've not had before with any tech support.

The Good:

* The Pen: Pressure sensitive ink is great. I've used it on the Samsung Series 7 Slate and it is just as good on the Surface Pro. Great for note taking. Can't do without it now.

* Recover/Reinstall times: Insanely fast. Last night I was able to completely reinstall Windows from the recovery partition in 10 minutes while on the phone with support. Blazing fast. 

The Not So Good:

* The Pen: It feels cheap. Not a deal breaker, creative too, they should have expected backlash from Artists. Not a deal breaker for me, but still reflects poorly.

* The Battery Life: I know this will likely get a lot of people to freak out, and I'm getting an hour to an hour and a half better on the Surface. Still a step up, but I would have wished for more.

* TypeCover trackpad: You get what you pay for. I wasn't expecting a great Trackpad

* Windows + HighDPI: This one really isn't the Surface's fault, so 100% is a little straining to work with. However, 150% scale makes me feel like I'm using a 720p panel again. Plus some applications (Chrome) are completely borked. That's not the fault of Windows or the Surface, but it is still not ideal.

The Bad:

* Launch Day: This was not great. I don't know if it was supply chain issues or artificial scarcity

The Weird:

* Rotation Lock: Randomly the ability to turn Rotation Lock On/Off from the Settings Charm just disables itself. I haven't quite figured out why.

* Weird keyboard/TypeCover bug: My night last night was very weird. My TypeCover stopped working completely last night, and they worked me through some troubleshooting steps, and nothing worked. Even after a complete Restore and even a Reinstall of Windows, the issue persisted. Support figured there was something wrong with the Surface, and an RMA was created. I went to bed, fully ready to send the Surface off for a replacement today, and tried again after waking up. Everything was back to normal. I had tried full power cycles, and letting it just sit overnight fixed the issue. Still have no clue what happened. Very weird.

In the end the Surface is hands down the best Windows Device I have ever used. I've owned a couple of Asus laptops, and the Surface is best hands down. There are a few things that need to be tightened up, but that will come with software updates and future generations of devices. Sorry for rambling a bit.

1361160403.0,18qc71,Tip: Changing your Start screen name from an email address to your First and Last name,Apotheosls,25,6,0,"For some of you who are using a non-Live/Outlook email address as your primary Microsoft/Live-account email address

To have your first and last name displayed on the Start screen instead of your email address:    

1. Log on to: https://account.live.com    

2. Under Overview &gt; Account Summary &gt; Edit Name &gt; Enter your first and last name. Save.    

3. On your Surface Pro (don't have an RT so i'm not sure if it works the same as Win8Pro) open up your Settings charm with a swipe from right to left &gt; Change PC Settings &gt; Users &gt; Switch to a local account. You can use any name for this local account. Go ahead and get logged in.    

4. Log out of that local account and via the same way you switched it to a local account

5. Your first and last name should now display on your Start screen!    

Found this out the hard way after realizing that my primary GMail addy was being displayed for all the world to see when i'm on the Start screen of my Surface....not that it matters that much

***********************************************************************

If you're like me, which is easy to do, but YMMV if you never dabble in the Registry Editor.

Surface RT Start Screen with 4th row: http://imgur.com/i45xK6m

* Run notepad
* Copy and paste the following three lines of text:

&gt; Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00                     

&gt; [HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\Scaling]

&gt; ""MonitorSize""=""12.1""

* Save file with .reg extension. (4thRowTweak.reg)
* Double-click the file to and approve the import of data.
* Restart the Surface.  

Apologies if this has been posted recently

**UPDATE:** The scaling will affect more than just the start screen's tile resizing

**UPDATE 2: STEPS TO REMOVE SCALING IF YOU DON'T LIKE THE CHANGES** If you find that you don't like the scaling, save the file with a .reg extension like you did above in the steps above.  You're essentially substituting the ""12.1"" value for a - (hyphen without quotes).  This will remove the key when you run the registry import.  

&gt; Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00                     

&gt; [HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\Scaling]

&gt; ""MonitorSize""= -

Restart and you should be back to your original settings.

2) Work. I'm in the medical field

3) Meetings. Some presentations, as most of the reviews indicating low battery life were from looping video, and unfortunately I'm not lucky enough to be looping 1080p movies during the ENTIRE meeting.  Maybe part of it :-)

4) Lectures.  Hey, I'm really curious as to what the battery life is with using the pen and powerpoint, etc..  Since you aren't watching a movie, you don't need all 400 nits of the screen at 100% brightness. So lets say it lasts 4.5 hours--definitely good enough for 2x 2h classes or 4x 1h  classes. 

4b) Yeah, it might not last the entire day. IF your major use for the device is note taking (all fucking day), and you just want to jot down some notes on slides, and type some stuff up in Word, I think you should consider an RT / atom processor device anyways.

5) Studying at a cafe or such. Maybe you're even streaming lectures.  Well I think most lectures can work at &lt;1080p--maybe I'm getting old, but I don't have the ability to study more than 5 hours continuously, and at that time the cafe owner would start getting pissed that you're really taking advantage of their space while drinking a measly $1.50 coffee :-).

6) Use outdoors, I don't know, but I've never gone to a park to watch 2 movies at full brightness in 1080p while browsing the internet simultaneously.

7) Long roadtrips. Yeah I remember that one time when I was a kid and we had a 10 hour drive and I was able to replace the batteries in my gameboy and play tetris the entire way and I got fucking good at that.

I was following a guide on how to perminantely move users and program data to another drive using audit mode and sysprep on Windows 8 and totally messed up my installation. Idiot me forgot to make a recovery USB. However I have another copy of Windows 8 that I downloaded through school. This is a short tutorial on how to unbrick your Surface if you have another copy of Windows 8 while salvaging your installation. Once complete you can make your recovery drive and not have to deal with this hassle again.    

What you need:    
Windows 8 ISO    
HP Bootable USB Tool:http://files.extremeoverclocking.com/file.php?f=197    
Flash Drive 8GB    

Simple instructions:    
1. Install the HP software
2. Extract the Windows 8 ISO to a folder.    
3. Copy the contents of the folder to the root directory of the flash drive.    
4. Turn off the Surface and make sure flash drive is connected.    
5. Hold the Volume Down Key and Power button and turn the device on.    
6. Windows 8 will boot from flash drive    
7. Don't Click Install at the bottom right
8. Let it find your OS and Select the option to Refresh the OS    
9. Takes about 10 minutes
10. To delete the Windows.OLD folder load Disk Clean Up and then select System Clean Up and delete the Windows.OLD partition.    

This guide is from memory but I would be happy to coach anyone through this if they need additional help.

So I turned to the Atom tablets.  I liked that it was still light and had great battery life. I had my eyes on the 11.6 inch Samsung Ativ. which I later purchased.  My friend picking up the Acer. I gotta admit, with a dock that added more battery! Meanwhile, the Ativ just proved too large and bulky.. and I never used it in the week I owned it.

When I went in on Saturday morning, I met an aquantance I hadn't seen for a while, who had come in to pick up the Surface... and as we talked, I decided... I'll give the device a chance. So I got in line, to pick up the... remaining, 64 GM tablet.

I walked out of the store, I realized that this tablet had more use in the 3 days I owned it, than the entire week I had the Ativ. I decided that.. I did have a place for it in my life. Not to supplement my laptop, but to replace it. I started to view the Surface Pro, as a Reverse Convertible. An Ultrabook, that had the form factor of a tablet. 

I still haven't stopped using it. I didn't get a type cover

1374986631.0,1j79fh,Halo: Spartan Assault - worth your money?,Rampaging_Elk,25,9,21,"The game has been out for a bit

**SUMMARY:** It has mostly been pretty fun

**THE BAD:** The Halo story, that was a huge disappointment. The little bit of text before every mission essentially boils down to ""Spartan destroys stuff."" Exposition is just there to pretend like your mission has meaning, but since it's a history lesson, it really doesn't. No character development or suspense or anything at all in the story to keep you engaged. Kind of like... it's a poorly designed educational game for Spartans. Instantly took a lot out of my desire to play the game before I even had a chance to start playing it. Even still, ignoring the chance to expand on the Halo universe bugs me as the biggest missed opportunity for the game. 

Worse is the pre-mission weapon select screen. The idea here is fine, you have to buy it EVERY LEVEL with more real money. This is even more insulting when you remember that you're supposed to be a Spartan in training. The system would have been fine if it was free and you could buy many different weapons, but every time I checked (I stopped after a while) your only options are all the same. Every mission. It would have been fine if you could unlock them all with in-game XP or with real money, but this turns the game's feeling into a dirty cash grab. Keep in mind, these are all still first impressions from buying the game to *the menus*. At this point, *you haven't even played the game*.

Extended from this, the shotgun) or don't work very uniquely or aren't even there.

**THE GOOD:** I know I've complained a lot, solid fun. Sounds are familiar, graphics are pretty good, and running around killing grunts and elites is satisfying. Some weapons and the armor abilities work very well in this new type of Halo game. The vehicle control is also surprisingly good. I look forward to missions where I get to pilot something, which I hadn't really expected. They do feel different from just running around. The levels are also short, but well built. Despite every mission boiling down to ""go here, kill that

There are also decent incentives to replaying the levels. High scores are good

**WORTH THE MONEY?** Sure, and I think $5 would have been better (or free with optional microtransactions). There's just nothing here to make it special at all, though there is some decent, generic fun to be had.",,False,self,False,t3_1j79fh

I now have both a Surface RT and a Surface Pro. Just wanted to share my thoughts on the Pro and how it stacks up to the RT.

You don't need me to tell you that the Pro is heavier

The weight is distributed slightly towards the left-hand side

It is noticeably hotter under load understandably

On the subject of gaming, constraining you to a box in the middle of the screen.

Most current-generation games that I've tried play on it to an acceptable standard. Borderlands 2 works great at 720/768p at medium-ish detail. You can drop it to low detail to run at 1080p for that crisp feeling

A Bluetooth game controller with x360ce to emulate a 360 controller for games is a very nice combination. No dongles here! The only drawback however is that the Pro and RTs WiFi performance suffers massively when using bluetooth.

I was marginally annoyed MS didn't stick to the same display standard for both the RT and the Pro

The basic layout of the RT and the Pro do have some differences. On the RT the USB is on the right near the top

Being free of the walled garden of apps except those I chose is very freeing. The RT feels very restricted in comparison and is now pretty much only used for content consumption or cases where longevity is important.

You can as it turns out use the smaller RT charger with the Pro tablet and vice-versa. The drawback in the former case being that charging takes much longer. But the Pro charger does have the nice bonus of letting you charge another USB device.

Overall I really like the Surface Pro. The price tag for the 128GB was a little steep however and I'd have really liked a bit more internal storage given that MicroSD limits you to 64GB extra.",self,t5_2u5h1,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/Surface/comments/1kcbxk/got_a_surface_pro_yesterday_here_are_my_thoughts/

The problem is that Windows 8 - at least desktop mode - absolutely sucks when you're trying to control it with just the screen. That's surely no doubt why the Surface Pro's standard cover is a keyboard and mouse.

But it doesn't have to be a pain in the ass to use the desktop. The nice thing about Windows is that, alone. There are great commands to close tabs/programs, switch applications, highlight and manipulate text, and do other tasks that would otherwise require the precision of a mouse.

Now, it's an extreme pain in the ass to close tabs in Chrome using just the screen. It usually takes me four or five different pokes before I finally get it.

Now imagine a program that could assign different gestures to those sort of actions. So

I wonder how difficult it would be to program something like this. But it'd really increase the usability of the Surface Pro by a huge amount

I'm not sure if I'm alone in this, but it'd be nice if I could lay down and use it as a tablet just as easily.

http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/surface/forum/surfwinrt-surfupdate/surface-will-not-wake-from-sleep-mode-after-march/277db26f-634a-4ec9-afaf-ca6c77b6ac20

There is a Microsoft engineer posting on that thread



************
After the massive patch in March I have noticed that there is noticeable lag in the system wake on pressing the power button. There are two scenario's - 

1) The tablet was recently used (less than the sleep timer in power settings) then the response to pressing power button is instant

2) The tablet has not be used recently and is in sleep mode. In this case there is a noticeable lag before the system wakes up. You need to hold down the power button for couple of seconds to wake the tablet. 

Before the March patch

This kind of heavy handed behavior on Microsoft's part is really pissing me off. Why not announce this change? Why is this not user configurable? Initially I thought my power button was dodgy and needed to be repaired until I spoke to some other Surface RT owners who also had the same puzzling behavior. Everyone of them also thought they needed to send the tablet in for repairs. Secondly I would rather have instant tablet wake than have a few minutes extra battery life during the day.

I'm an undergraduate engineering student and i've been looking for a tablet with dedicated stylus support, so when i first saw the Surface keynote speech a while back i figured it could be a contender to do what i need done.

**Stylus** 

Works amazingly simply put. Now i haven't used *too* many styluses in my life, but be prepared to be annoyed considering all buttons on taskbars in programs are along the edges of the screen, so it gets frustrating fast.

You WILL lose the stylus if you keep it anywhere other than an external pocket or something. It is not secure in the magnetic charger slot. At all.

**Onenote 2013**

I've never used Onenote before, and i can annotate and draw in any equations or notes i have from the lecture directly onto the slide. Or pop open the touch cover and type away anywhere on the screen if i cant write fast enough. Bam done. 

Heck, but i thought that was pretty neat.

**MS Office / PDFs / MATLAB**

Nothing to really say about Office, but yeah programming software is not a problem. Haven't tried any CAD software, but it should be capable of running CAD stuff as well.

**Battery**

On Airplane mode, i deplete about 30-40% in 2 hours of constant note taking. I haven't drained it any further than that since i usually have outlets available to me, but extrapolating on those values (although it probably isn't linear) i would hazard a guess you could maybe squeeze out about 5-6 hours of note-taking with those power settings. If you want WIFI on (but other power settings still on) , maybe reduce that estimate to 4-5ish hours 

It doesn't get too hot on use, since you're always gonna be charging it...

**Typing (TouchCover

Uhhh, but typing on the touch cover is a whole different ball game. It's not like typing on a virtual touch keyboard on a screen, and its not like typing on a physical keyboard... it's a hybrid which take getting use to. You better make friends with your backspace key because its hard as fuck to see what you're typing. On a type keyboard you can feel the buttons, on a virtual touch keyboard, you can SEE the buttons, but with this you lose both. It's not on the screen, so you can't see it, so you can't feel it. So good luck. 
Theres no screen dim function button! Seriously?! MS puts a fucking 'Share' button on it

edit: how could i forget this part - theres no light for the caps lock button! Theres no notificiation on the OS either

**What if you don't have a desk?**

I hear a lot of people complaining about the weird centre of mass when is in your lap which makes it annoying. Let me tell you an easy $2 fix. A clipboard. 

Step 1: Buy clipboard

Step 2: Put clipboard on lap

Step 3: Put Surface Pro on clipboard

Done. It's not going anywhere. Plus the clipboard will be a lot cleaner than your pants or a desk


If anyone has any specific questions

Cheers

10AM rolls by and the sales start. End up waiting in line waiting for the first #13 people to finish their purchases. Watching people ask so many questions

First of all, and my money is more than well spent.

Every day that I use it, thats an amazing device.

The build quality. Is superb. Its absolutely brilliant! From the clever placement of the micro sd slot

The OS. Its colourful. Its vibrant. Its smooth. Its fluid. Its responsive. Its beautiful. Of course its not perfect, now everything seems to natural and intuitive. If i pick up my mums ipad and attempt to use it, i find it extremely slow, cumbersome and difficult to navigate.

Touch Cover. I expected that it would be difficult to use. When i first got it, i was nearly as quick as on a standard keyboard. And it is so much better than a touch screen keyboard.

All in all

As with any technological product there are bound to be some flaws, and the rest can easily be fixed by software updates. 

On a second note, but i didn't want to risk it. On the other hand, i also dont want to wear out the felt on the touch cover by continually placing it on the table. Even if i were to find a case, i dont want to add to the thickness of the surface and spoil its beautiful looks, so i did the next best thing. I went and bought a large sheet of carbon fibre design skin and manually cut it to fit the back of the surface. It turned out really clean, and it looks absolutely amazing (in my opinion)! So i thought i'd share it with you guys and see what you think! [Here!](http://imgur.com/a/94Ekw)",,self,,

My design is a hub that would fit between the camera and the kickstand on the back of the device and would offer the following functionality:

* 4 USB 2.0
* 2 3.5mm audio 
* Full size SD card slot (without messing with the microsd)
* Full size HDMI

* (maybe) more flash memory built in
* (maybe) larger speakers
* (maybe) Ethernet 10/100 

Right now I am in the middle of 3d printing the design I've been working and reworking for a couple months. I should be able to get some basic pictures up sometime later today. The reason I haven't looked into this sooner is because of the unfortunately low interest in the RT which would reflect on any type of sales I would do if any.

So what do you think?

**EDIT**: Here are some pics of an early concept done in sketchup. These are not the latest design but will give you a taste of my idea. The idea is that the 3 main ports (usb,5) will be used to lock the hub on to the back.

Surface was initially created because Microsoft didn't think that their OEMs were doing a good enough job in coming up with good hardware to go with Windows 8. It's entirely possible that they didn't really want to get into hardware

The thinking seems to be that if we (Microsoft) threaten to release our Surface Pro, and we won't have stolen sales from them. In fact, I bet the OEMs are to some degree behind the slow rollout to the different geographies. That, and the fact that tablet hardware is a new stream for Microsoft.

Now, I'd rather drop my cell phone all together because of the absurd pricing in the current market.

1351816313.0,12hldz,[Aus] Surface finally arrived!,lostsilence,19,5,34,"Hi all

As the title suggests

Details: Ordered it as soon as the pre-orders were made available and was told it would be here by the 6th Nov when I rang to see where it was. Finally arrived this morning

Quick Review/Notes:

* For some reason the trackpad on the touch cover seems very erratic at times (Guessing it was during high CPU activity). I honestly thought after a few minutes of use that I'd have to return the cover. It is difficult to know what the machine is running in the background at times when you can't see it or hear any crunching away of a HDD

* Upon booting, as they no longer were the 'preview' versions of office.. This was resolved by right clicking and selecting unpin, then repinning the items again

* Google Search (which can be found on the Win8 store) is nowhere to be seen on the RT store

* By default when clicking into a text area/field the keyboard doesn't show up automatically when in desktop mode. Rather

* Wireless signal seems good. Will need to test/compare with other devices (iPad, iPhone) when some form of wireless tool becomes available in the store

* Weight feels relatively the same as the iPad

* The magnetic grip of the keyboard to the device is strong! Think iPad's smart cover grip x2. I couldn't (easily) get the keyboard to fall off by shaking it

* Wallpapers...Unfortunately depending on your wallpaper settings (eg: mine is currently on stretch)

* Keyboard is as many of the reviews describe. Good, and found the onscreen keyboard was extremely easy/quicker for typing at first as the keys are large enough to allow for quick typing. The keyboard itself doesn't feel weird to type on, though you occasionally have to double check the position of your fingers (alike any new keyboard where some keys are shifted/moved around). Only downside is there is no F1-F12 keys on the keyboard. They've been replaced by media style keys (think of the old microsoft internet based keyboards with home, volume &amp; media controls, etc). Little painful when I'm used to using the F-Keys in development mode, but I'll survive.

* USB devices work! Tried external hard drives

* Printing works nicely too! Network printer automatically detected by Win8

I'll be sure to post/edit some more notes on the surface if there is interest :)

It is relatively normal for computer technology companies to release updated versions of their devices after around 6 months on the market and certainly by the year mark.

So I guess my question is: is it worth buying the pro on UK release or should I wait another few months for a hardware update? I have been really really looking forward to this release but Microsoft have clearly ballsed it up.

EDIT: It seams the new Haswell processor which will be unveiled by Intel on the 3rd of June (like 3 days after release of the Surface) is going to be a significant performance boost. I think Haswell based computers will be on the market within a few months, there is no point in buying a Surface over a Haswell based alternative.

I'm thinking of upgrading to the Surface Pro.

I've currently got a [Samsung ATIV Smart PC 500T](http://www.amazon.com/Samsung-ATIV-Smart-PC-500T/dp/B0098O9TB0) with the keyboard dock and I've had it for a few months.  It's been pretty good, web, email, etc.  Watching video is fine, though it can struggle with 1080p (I know the 500t *isn't* 1080p, but I have a number of 1080p videos that I don't feel like converting to a lower res.)

Then there are things that make it whimper:

* SQL Server Management Studio connected to a large database (Intellisense struggles quite a bit) - this is a priority for me.
* OneNote - handwriting with the stylus sometimes has some very noticeable lag
* Metro apps in general (I still call them Metro apps...) are generally sluggish no matter how basic they are.  It frustrates me to be looking at something that is clearly a pretty simple app
* Games - obviously I didn't get an Atom processor-based tablet to be a gaming PC ;)  Even so I thought it would handle basic games MUCH better than it does.  Again

Honestly I think I've discovered that I'd rather have something more along the lines of an ultrabook which I mostly consider the Surface Pro to be.  I've played around with one in a Best Buy and laughed at how much more responsive the entire experience was compared to my 500t.  I love the hardware design and the Type keyboard.  Good stuff!

I'm thinking of selling my Samsung and buying a Surface Pro.  What I need to decide is what *exactly* I need to buy.

Essentials:
* Surface Pro 128GB - $999
* Type Keyboard - $129
* Mini DisplayPort to HDMI adapter - $10 (off-brand through Amazon)

That's about $1140 before any tax/shipping.  Ouch... help me justify it ;)

Anything else I ""need""?  What are your thoughts on Microsoft's extra warranty?  ""Microsoft Complete"" - $149 doesn't seem bad

If you read this whole thing I applaud your perseverance lol.  Thanks!

I've been mulling a decision on exactly what I should replace my aging laptop with. My laptop is a early 2008 MacBook Pro, and the left I/O board is on the way out. I love it to death, but the time has come for it to be replaced.

Now, so I want to travel light and leave the heavy stuff to my PC back home. However, someone I follow on YouTube has gotten a Surface RT with the Type Cover and it seems to be a VERY solid productivity machine, and while I was initially skeptical of the Surface, it is growing on me.

So, and if so, how its going for them. The only thing I'd really miss is the ability to do Android command line shenanigans with my laptop, but at this rate, I am beginning to not really care about it.

Is there anything that you guys think I'd be missing? Or would I be happy as a clam in Surface-land? Because right now

**Q: So many questions...but I guess my biggest one is why (now that its almost out) was there a 3 month gap between the surface RT and surface pro? Since it looks like you guys didn't get any super early access to haswell chips (or any other tech)

**A:** This is simple.  We started the Pro 3 months after we started Surface RT :-) That is exactly when we staffed the team to go and bring this product to life!

---

**Q: Why no docking station?? You're so close to full desktop replacement here!**


**A:** Hey

---

**Q: For the Surface Pro....is the boot loader unlocked? Can I do what I want with my (potential) property? Or am I locked in to Windows 8?**

**A:** Like other Windows 8 machines

---

**Q: Why did you allocate the storage space in the way you did? Surely you could have anticipated the bad press you're currently getting for shipping with relatively low free storage space?**

**A:** Hello from the surface team
We designed Surface Pro (and the allocation of disk space on our systems) to have the power of full Windows 8, USB 3.0 and SkyDrive (including 7GB of free storage).  Windows does provide tools that allow you to free space by easily removing applications you are not using as well as move the recovery image to a USB thumbdrive.   
EDIT UPDATE: We decided to ship a Pro 64GB sku as it provides full windows 8 and enough storage for a number of large application installs such as games

---

**Q: As many reviews have pointed out, and have scaling on my external display at 100%.  Are there plans to fix this in Windows 8?**

**A:** The Windows team is aggressively working on this feature to fix this for all high resolution Windows devices. We don’t have a date yet to share

1. I personally use 125% scaling.. and like that better for what I use Surface Pro for… see more things on the screen.. and the size of the text suits me just fine. 
2. Next I make sure my Second Screen is set to Extended mode.
3. Then I adjust my Office apps using the built in zoom control (lower right of office apps) to set the desired text size.  In Windows 8 the Desktop can be thrown on your second monitor and operate all your office apps... nice.  
4. For Outlook if I have on my second monitor I switch Outlook into mouse mode. 
5. Also in Outlook you can change your Zoom Setting in new message (compose window under zoom).. and it will also persist (which is nice). 
6. In IE desktop.. same thing.. the zoom persists on the desktop.. And I use IE 10 desktop in desktop mode.. and the touch version of IE10 on my Surface modern screen. 
7. You can also change the width of the cursor under Ease of Access. 
8. Also… not a must but

**Q: Why did Microsoft not work at improving the battery life of the Pro? Reviews put it between 4 to 5 hours of battery life

**A:** Awesome question.  The product was designed to take full advantage of Windows 8 coupled with the Ivy Bridge core processor from Intel.  We created a product that did not compromise speed, but still deliver you the tablet form factor.  This product is optimized in every way to take advantage of the full third generation core i5 it runs, yet give the best battery life.  If you compare it to say a MacBook Air, you will quickly see that pound for pound in battery size vs battery life, you will find optimizations that puts Surface best in its class.  

That said we picked a smaller battery to be sure we were able to give you the same performance and to keep it thin.  This kept the weight under 2lbs, great sketching).  While these tradeoffs are challenges as much as they are opportunities, we think given the performance and experience you will be getting, it is an exciting product.

**Q: Is [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOvQCPLkPt4) technology included in the Pro?  If not

**A:** Hey, and in other ways the industry has a ways to go. The demo you are seeing is a research prototype we developed to understand touch and graphics latency. It is meant to ask questions such as what level of latency is perceivable to the user. The research demo does not contain a full engineering solution which is productizable yet.. for example we used a projector that can project at 30Khz.. not really something you can carry around…. However, two things that got tech-transferred into this generation of products.. The first is that we understand the impact of latency on the user experience … the lower the latency of the system, the faster you get your work done.. even 10ms makes a difference. So, one of the things we focused on in Windows 8, was touch latency.. The whole system is tuned to deliver one of the fastest touch to graphical responses… we reduced the latency of all Windows 8 touch controllers to be below 12ms, and Windows 8 optimized the input thread to be the highest priority. The result.. buttery smooth touch input that makes the graphics almost stick to your finger… (just compare Surface side by side to other tablets/phones).. I am super happy on where we have gotten with latency.. Industry leading.. and the beauty is because of research we know how much we should keep going .. Finally the second part which got tech transferred was digitizer tech used in the research demo in that video.. the superfast pressure sensitive digitizer made its way into touchcover

---

**Q: Have you performance tested for graphical and engineering type applications? If so is the hardware acceptable for software like SketchUp, etc?**

**A:** Hey; Andrew here. First chance we had we installed our cad software on prototypes. It was meta-cool to have the 3D models of the device up on the screen of the device. I am excited to start using the device as I travel to have models to review with vendors without having to pack my monster laptop. Also; using the pen to redline drawings is cool.

---

**Q: I have a Windows 7 PC at home. I play games and watch media just like most people. Why do I need a Surface?**

**A:** If you're looking for an all-day battery and an entertainment-first experience with the ability to still get some work done – Surface RT is for you. If you want a powerful PC that gets work done with the flexibility of a tablet

---

**Q: Does Microsoft have any plans for an external battery or for a thicker keyboard cover that has an extra battery?  ~~Or

**A:** That would require extending the design of the accessory spine to include some way to transfer higher current between the peripheral and the main battery.  Which we did...

---

**Q: Can I bundle a type cover instead of a touch? I like black

**A:** We will sell Surface Pro without a cover to allow customers to select the color or style cover of their choice.  We are releasing a set of Limited Edition touch covers starting in February and will continue to evolve Limited Editions to give customers more choices and options for colors across our colors in the future. 

Pricing and release information for Surface Pro in the UK will be coming soon.

**Q: What additional pressure can MS put on partners like Twitter, who have built a very functional app that is also a thing of beauty to use on the Surface and on desktops. Also how soon can we expect fixes for some of the wifi issues with the RT version, as well as continued issues with xbox music?**

**A:** At Windows 8 launch we talked about the Store as a ""grand opening"" because even though we felt great about the day 1 app selection we knew we were just getting started.  In the last 2 months we have seen over 100M app downloads and since GA we have seen the selection grow by 4 times over.  I think we added 10K apps in the last month.  Those are all big numbers but don't exactly address your question about what we are doing with the top ecosystem partners to make high quality

---

**Q: What are the new connectors on the bottom of the Surface Pro for?**

**A:** Wow - I'm pumped you caught that - we haven't announced what they are for but they aren't an accident!  At launch we talked about the ""accessory spine"" and hinted at future peripherals that can click in and do more.  Those connectors look like can carry more current than the pogo pins

---

**Q: Can you explain the branding choice to use ""RT"" and ""Pro"". I am a Web Designer

**A:** Thanks for asking this - Windows 8 introduced a lot of change from the UX to the app model to the store.  Of course that all started with an expansion of the platforms we run on to include ARM.  When we designed the new Windows runtime (WinRT) we designed it to be cross platform so new Windows 8 apps could run on both X86 and ARM platforms.  Windows RT is what we called the version of Windows that runs on ARM because it is compatible with WinRT apps.  You're asking a more general question and we haven't faced having to explain a range of platforms since the introduction of Windows NT and will keep investing in driving clarity.

---

**Q: why the decision to go with the displayport output instead of full hdmi? How will you continue to convince developers to create Windows Store applications of their existing x86 software while still selling this product? what is the incentive, how do you get them to embrace new forms of input (this is basically saying: I don't want to use mouse/keyboard applications on tablets, how do you incentivize them to use a tablet optimized UI)?**

**A:** Hi

---

**Q: What's the coolest thing you've seen the Surface used for? What is the coolest thing you can imagine the Surface being used for in the near future?**

**A:** Hey this is StevieB.. Surface Pro is a unique tablet.. in that it offers 4 modes of input in a compact form factor. It has touch, running Outlook, and flipping it to the desk and running a full version of PhotoShop. I just loaded photoshop the other day.. and boy it loaded fast.. faster than my desktop. I was like ya baby .. so Surface Pro has the power when you need, but throttles down heavily when you don’t need it so that you can carry it around.. pound for pound it is the fastest most portable device out there.. 

---

**Q: I'm seriously considering buying a Surface Pro to use as a more portable laptop, Samsung, etc)?**

**A:** Surface Pro is perfect for the person that wants a MacBook Air and an iPad

Anyone will tell you

So I started looking into things and found this pretty cool little thing called ArtDock.

http://konartist3d.deviantart.com/art/ArtDock-283342420

Basically its a touch overly for your tablet that lets you control various art style programs but there's a bit of an issue with it on the surface pro.

The buttons, like the detection for them is smaller than the actual images. I realize that ArtDock was designed for older tablets with smaller resolutions and I figured that this was the problem until I came across a version of it claiming it was optimized for surface pro.

On April 26, Touch Cover and extra Power Adapter. I go to pay via PayPal and the website says it's unable to complete the transaction. I try my credit card instead, same message. I decide to call the store and place the order over the phone.

Customer service rep goes to place the order, I'll cancel the orders. He finally places the right order. 

I then start receiving shipping confirmation emails so I call Microsoft to confirm that the first two orders have indeed been cancelled. I'm told that the orders have indeed been cancelled and that the system automatically generates those emails but that *nothing* has shipped.

Lo and behold a box from Microsoft arrives at my door containing a Surface RT. Next day

Fast forward to May 15. I order another three Pros for work. The website again says there are technical difficulties so again I call. The agent tells me that the store is undergoing maintenance and that he can't process my order. He takes my information down anyway and tells me that he'll call me when he is able to place the order. He never calls back.

I call back the next day. The person I speak with tells me that the order was never placed and that he can help me place the order. He also tells me that he'll be placing three separate orders (because each Surface has a Complete warranty and thus needs to have its own order number).  He takes all of my information down and puts me on hold. A few minutes later he comes back and he tells me that the first order has been placed. He then tells me that he has to put me on hold so that he can process the next order.

**I wait on hold for 45 minutes.**

I finally give up and call back. I get another agent this time and explain the situation. She gets my information and checks my order history. She confirms that nothing has been ordered. I call my credit card company to double check. They tell me that there's an approval from the Microsoft Store but won't know if anything has been charged until it posts (about 5 days)

So I go to Best Buy and purchase all my Surface hardware today. When I get home, it arrived today. Yes, I have to initiate another return.

This has been the most frustrating and infuriating experience I've ever had trying to order anything. I'm so angry right now I had to rant.

1373969896.0,1iel8t,8.1 Surface Pro Wifi woes - anyone with a solution?,TheLifeAquatic,13,4,16,"So

I've tried a multiple things to address this

* Upgrading the network adapter drivers
* Rolling back the network adapter drivers
* Messing with the resetlog.txt in admin powershell
* Toggling metered connections on/off

Pretty much all of these work as temporary fixes to the problem - after trying any of the above I'll usually get somewhere between 5-20 minutes before my internet craps out on me again. This is incredibly frustrating.

Now, because I haven't run into this issue when tethering or using it at coffee shops etc. Seems to just be my home network that is the issue.

Some other annoying info to throw out:

* When the internet isn't working in the browser(s)
* The 8.1 preview seems to have removed the date-stamp on the Marvell Avastar drivers when I'm in the network adapter settings
* Unrelated to my network woes - but the freaking button on my wacom pen pops out!

I've always ignored any commercials for ""tablets"" and subsequently ignored Surface commercials. Although they are somewhat entertaining. But after reading [Gabe @ Penny Arcade's review](http://www.penny-arcade.com/2013/02/22/the-ms-surface-pro) of the Surface Pro

I am, but it was basically his first impressions. I'm concerned about the longevity. I understand you can get a solid 4 hours, and that works fine for me... I'm seldom away from an outlet for over 4 hours at a time. However, can I count on the battery life staying at 4 hours? In my experience with laptops, batteries go bad after some time. My Acer laptop I keep plugged in constantly and now barely holds any charge, maybe about 20 minutes. But we can't replace the battery on the Surface. Is my 4 hours going to dwindle down into nothingness like a laptop? Excuse me if this is a dumb question, but I don't have much experience with tablets, anyways.

There are no Wacom drivers for Photoshop yet, and although I am not a gamer, I do plan on doing intense graphic work, and there can be absolutely no lagging while drawing. The lines get jaggedy; I've experienced this before. I have this really old [Fujitsu Stylistic Tablet](http://www.cnet.com/laptops/fujitsu-stylistic-st5000-series/4505-3121_7-30674694.html) that is nearly a decade old, and while it did support photoshop, WITH pressure sensitivity, it was ultimately too slow. I'm sure they would have fixed this within the past 9 years, Photoshop's pressure sensitivity isn't even supported on Surface Pro right now. What's up with that

Speaking of buying something brand-new... I am NOT the type to do that. I never get first-generation anything. I mean, they're worthless. 1stgens are untested, people discover all these bugs, and then what? The company takes this information into consideration and makes a better product next year. Rinse, lather, repeat. I can't drop ~ a $thou to upgrade every couple years, this thing needs to last me for at least 5-8 years. I'm the type of girl to buy that hot new game after it's several months old, and it's on sale because the third version just came out.

But I am nearly consumed with want for this Surface Pro. I illustrated a children's book a while ago, trying to be creative on the computer again is the LAST thing I want to do, or am even capable of doing. When I illustrated my first book, doing this nearly killed me. I want to learn from that, and I need to get out and about and be creative on the go. I feel like with the Wacom technology in the Surface Pro, I can do that. No other tablet or convertible laptop has that Wacom tech I need. 

But I'm still on the fence. Mostly I think I'm afraid of dropping ~$1k on this thing that is so new. I guess I just want to know that it's worth it

**tl;dr:** *(sorry the post became much longer than I expected)* ... will the already-limited battery life stay at 4ish hours through the coming years? Are there any artists here who can give their insight into using the tablet for illustration? Will Photoshop driver support come soon? What's up with the overheating underclocking? Should this penny-pincher wait until this new product is more well-tested? I've never paid more than $800 on an electronic device

December 17

I wanted to see the Microsoft Surface in Staples and Best Buy. The following are my notes:

Staples Watchung NJ:

I was looking at several tablets but could not locate the Surface. I asked a sales person if they could direct me to the Microsoft Tablet. The sales person asked me which one I wanted to see. I said, there are quite a few,” as the salesperson showed me the Galaxy, and several others. I asked, “What about the tablet manufactured by Microsoft?” The salesperson responded, “Oh, we don’t have any of those.” I asked, would you mind checking with someone?” The sales person checked with a manager, it is in the back of the store at an end cap.” We journeyed past all the Desktops, till we got to the back of the store and saw the Surface. Here are some pictures I took to show you the display

In the picture above, “We don’t have those.” My guess is they actually do have them, and that the salesperson just did not know.

In the picture above

In the picture above, and really was not a pleasurable user experience. As I touched one of the legs, the store alarms started to ring loudly. 

Above are two more pictures of the touch cover displayed unattached to the device.

I asked to speak with the store manager. The store manager and another manager spoke with me about the Surface. I asked, “What is that?” I mentioned it was another tablet which would have full Windows 8.” Both responded that they don’t think such a machine has been announced. I explained it has been announced, and perhaps they should read up on it.

I showed the store manager how the security device on the tablet itself was not giving the user the ability to fold the hinge

I told the manager I was surprised the display was tucked in the back of the store

I showed the store manager how the user experience was awful. The store manager mentioned, whereas the user experience wasn’t painful. The response was, “No sir, this is the way Staples is displaying the product in all of their stores.” I mentioned, “This is like a butcher selling fine prime steaks, and the ones in display were old, smelly

I mentioned to the manager that I would be shocked if the other Staples stores displayed this all the same way. The store manager mentioned that is the case. I asked, and this type of display would possibly enforce this negative thinking.” The salesperson responded, “Sir, a lot of thought and decisions go into store placement and security devices. There is no reason to mention this display to anyone else. I’m sorry you don’t like it.”

With that I left the store and traveled East ward to my next Staples Store.


Staples Springfield NJ

I walked into the Springfield NJ store. As soon as you walk in, and gave the user the ability to take the keyboard off of the tablet, close the hinge, and use the machine.

The picture above was from the Staples Springfield NJ store. Clean display

I spoke with a salesperson. The salesperson mentioned that the user experience is very impressive, these will go flying off the shelves.” I spoke with several Staples workers at the Springfield store, all seemed knowledgeable of the Surface and the forthcoming Surface Pro.

Obviously all Staples stores are not displaying the Surface in the same end cap at the back of the store as is Watchung NJ Staples

Best Buy Union NJ

As soon as you walk in the doors, and this person also mentioned, “I am getting a Surface Pro when it comes out next month.” 

The one issue at Best Buy Union was that the Touch Cover had a security device on the bottom of the pad.

The user experience wasn’t awful, the experience is hindered by the security device placement. Also, I agree with you, and we should also display the Type Cover. Thanks for bringing this to my attention, and honestly, this was quite helpful.”

For my drawing tablet, will probably get one anyway when I'm old and rich, but now I'm straight out of school and on to my first job.

My biggest complaint so far is simply the fact that Photoshop just isn't designed to be used on a tablet. It relies on either very small buttons

Secondly

Finally, drawing naturally, but if I try to poke at little buttons (especially in the corner of the device), it quickly loses accuracy. I've tried calibrating my stylus with 200 points, which certainly helped, but it's still not as perfect as I'd like for it to be.

1364839783.0,1bfpr2,Surface Pro as a Workstation,Zenatic,15,7,16,"So I have a gaming rig already and plan to dedicate it to gaming.  I also have a work laptop I use for my job (I work from home).  I have 3 monitors on my desk and a USB switch I use for switching between work docking station and gaming rig.

I am in the market for a workstation and a tablet.  I am curious if the Surface Pro would be a viable candidate to save me some cash and kill 2 birds with 1 stone.

Workstation usage:

* Aptana/Eclipse (Web programming)
* MySQL GUI Tools
* Skype
* Office
* General coding usage
* Dabbling in Blender3d (Strictly fun hobby) (low priority)
* Dabbling in video editing (Strictly fun hobby) (low priority)
* Reddit

Tablet usage:

* XBMC remote
* Web Browsing
* Comic Reading
* Reddit

I figure a  i5 or i7 Workstation (small form factor) will run me about $650 (self built)

Would the Surface PRO be able to handle what I throw at it using a USB 3.0 docking station to support 2-3 external monitors and do my workstation work?  I realize 3D and Video Editing might be a little slow
