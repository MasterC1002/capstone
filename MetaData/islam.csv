Ramadan this year falls on a special time in the Jewish calendar - it aligns with the start of the Jewish month of Av. This month also has special significance and Jews refrain from eating meat for the first 8 days and then fast on the 9th.

The best I could conjure up was ""As-Salaam-Alaikum"", the boy continued looking back at me, smiling (I'm a white guy with a big beard - probably funny looking to this kid).  I kept smiling and waving, and the women had to drag him a bit to get him moving.

Are we seriously continuing to blame the West for all our problems? Are we that shallow, this corruption upon the Earth is unbecoming of you my brothers and sisters. I refuse to think along the lines that, ""well they were bad to us, so we can be bad to them"". Is that what the Prophet's life has taught us? Is that how he would've thought about this? Is Islam so threatened that we need to go ape-shit crazy because of some low production piece of crap video? This goes to show that our problem is much deeper and scarier than anyone has thought.

Applying psychological and anthropological theory on all this betrays the fact that we are more frustrated with ourselves and our Ummah, and continued to focus on self betterment, self cultivation, and the advancement of society as a whole. That is the greater Jihad, the greater struggle.

It is not enough to pray five times a day to be a good Muslim.

It is not enough to go to Friday prayers

It is certainly not enough to wear your beard

These are external gestures that can be taught to anyone

You must strive! You must strive to take the higher road. You must strive to better your own self and how you react to others and their insults. You must, regardless of creed. Muslims are not superior to anyone as long as they have not raised their character and their civility, as our fore-bearers had done. You must resist the urge to blame everything wrong with our existence on those who oppose us, for they have no power over us except for what Allah has ordained. And in order to honor our Creator, our Islam, and our Prophet, we must represent them with the highest values that Islam has brought. Anger, violence are not what the civilizing mission of the Qur'an had brought to the savage Arab tribes and Quraish. It was in fact the very opposite.

I introduced myself here before. A refresher to my story is that my boyfriend accepted Islam while in a relationship with me. I've been interested in Islam for some years

Well, we were greeted by an Imam. He led us to his office and we asked questions. I was the one with more questions, of course. He explained Islam so beautifully. I already had had a sense of what Islam was, but there were some things I fully did not understand and know, as well. He also told us about their Arabic courses and Salat(Salah?) courses they have for new converts that will begin sometime this month. We both plan on attending those in the future.

When it was time for prayer, were family, too. It was so beautiful. When we were there during the prayers, I had this overwhelming sense of peace that I've never had before. I almost wanted to cry.

That was when I knew that that day was the day. I did not want to put it off any longer. Upon returning to his office

I'm immensely happy with my decision to convert. I have been feeling happier and more at peace since my visit. They gave us Qurans, I will do what I can to become a better Muslim. 

We also spoke to the Sheikh about marriage. He came at a later time. He was also very nice. We just have to speak to him about everything at a later time and have an appointment with him.

Very quick: I did not convert because of my boyfriend. I would have converted eventually with or without him.. There were times when he even thought I hated the fact that he was Muslim. But that wasn't the case. I was just taking things slowly. I was at a different level than he was and I was questioning everything because I didn't know.

In the name of God

May He send His peace and blessings upon our beloved Prophet Muhammad, and the generations after them. 

In light of recent events in /r/Islam, do I speak of our general population of /r/Islam subscribers. A majority of you have shown a level of calm and respectful discussion, and that is always highly encouraged here in /r/Islam. 

It is also noteworthy to state the opposite: there were a few that spoke with disrespect, **Muslim or not**. 

After some deliberation amongst the moderators, which was also a primary reason before the more recent incident occurred. Let it be very clear, the rules of /r/Islam apply to non-Muslims and Muslims equally - while even on top of this, these rules are incomparable to the rules laid down by Islam itself upon Muslims. 

Excerpts from a message the Sheykh at my local mosque sent to the community in regards to recent events: 

&gt;It is on these grounds that I say firmly to the people of Egypt: what a group amongst you did was wrong. There is no justification within the teachings of Islam that would permit you to, or anywhere for that matter, has nothing to do with the acts of a small group of Americans. I understand you were seeking to uphold the honor of the Noble Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him and all the Messengers of God), but I urge you to consider that the legacy of the Prophet is not upheld through the storming of an embassy but rather through the embodiment of the noble character and principles with which he was sent.

&gt;I also say to those who perpetrated the assault on the US Consulate in Libya: you too were wrong and you do not represent the Libyan people. The attack of a Consulate cannot be justified and the killing of innocent people is not only unacceptable

&gt;I say to Muslims all over the world (as I write this new incidents are on the brink of occurring): the attacking of US Embassies is not permissible and your actions are not a defense of the message of our Prophet

&gt;I say to the producers of the film which portrayed the Noble Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) in a disrespectful way and which lays at the heart of many of the protests that we have seen: freedom of speech is a right and a responsibility. It is not preserved in our Bill of Rights to be abused and used with negligence

May God reward you all with what is good. Keep doing what ya'll are doing. 

Sincerely

h4qq

I consider myself a Muslim. But as I learn more about Islam, our growing population, and our economic, social, intellectual, and political failures - I find myself becoming ashamed of being a Muslim.

There is not a single Muslim nation on this earth that isn't corrupt to its absolute core (except for, in droves, to live in the North America and Europe. Most import their customs and political ideologies to their host nations and refuse to assimilate, all the while praising their native homeland and striving to establish their Islamic political ideologies - which have utterly failed them back home. 

There are 1.2 billion muslims on the planet - and yet the scientific output from the so-called Islamic nations is near non-existant. It astounds me that 1.2 BILLION muslims cannot come together to strive towards improving the world for all of humanity (non-mulsims included) - instead we are:

1) Killing each other (Syria, Afghanistan, Syria, Palestinians (factions killing each other)... etc) the list goes on

2) Living off of the aid from the west (Pakistan

3) Immigrating in droves, parts of Toronto, Canada)... allthewhile refusing to, or being unable to institute appropriate reforms back home.

It amazes me that Muslims, Muslim/Arab hospitality is amazing. Arabs have a tremendous culture of making guests feel welome. There is a tremendous sense of honour in the act of being generous and giving to  others in ones social circle - however, if you are wronged, or if your honor is questioned - all decency and respect is thrown out the window - and the situation quickly deteriorates into hatred, disrespect, violence, and oftentimes assault or death. 

Perhaps what really irks me the most about Muslims is the ""George Bush Mentality"" when it comes to islam. There is a lack of tolerance when it comes to differing point of views. Many (if not most) Sunni's consider their Shia brothers and sisters as Kaafirs (the reverse

From an ideological point of view - I have come to realize the majority of muslims have barely read the Quran - most don't even read arabic. And most have not read the hadith in any depth. The foundation of a muslims beliefe system is often based on what they are told - not what they have read or learned on their own. This saddens me because there is a tremendous volume of conflicting literature in Islamic history and theology to be discovered and reconciled - but instead we ascribe to viewpoints based on what sect or madhaab we were born in.

On the topic of Allah - I am beginning to ask myself some serious philosophical questions. 

1) A God who is all powerful, what absolutely astounds me is how Allah can damn a people to hell if they refuse to recognize him him. How can Allah be insulted to the point of damning someone to hell for all of eternity for for not being recognized by his creation - a creation that, by comparison to Allah, is insignificant, to say the least. This sounds incredibly egotistical, and petty - to say the least. Almost tyrannical. 

2) Furthermore, misguide someone, and then damn him or her to hell? It makes little sense. Furthermore, there are ahadith that state that at 40 days from conception - the destiny of a newborns souls is pre-written. Weather that persone will live a good life or a wretched life will be determined before birth. Obviously we are not all created equal - and yet there are certain inalienable sins in islam, (homosexuality, adultery, murder

I know that the prophet SAW got pissed off when the Sahaba asked him about predestination. But in all honesty - it is an excellent question

Finally, he has made it the option of disbelief equally believable, from a purely logical point of view. If a persone rationally chooses to disbelieve in God, which may or may not be correct - can he be held accountable for such a rational beliefe on the day of judgement? Will he be denied paradise if such a person was actually a tremendous source of good and yet denied the existence of god?

Totally random rant.... Just expressing my totally confused state of mind...

Head over and read [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/1d6eb7/you_treated_her_like_a_piece_of_meat_judges_fury/). And then go to the comments, gangs that groom non-Muslim girls for prostitution and rape in England, Imams talking about how women bring on rape if they dress a certain way, 80% of women in Pakistani jails because of completely wrong rape laws, we've got a crisis on our hands. (Yes, there is media selection bias - but nonetheless, still a problem).

And you know what it starts with? ""Wow, we went out, she's such a slut"". 

Frankly it comes down to this. If a woman is not dressed the way 'we' consider to be appropriate, this even translates to 'she is deserving of rape'. This is part of rape culture. 

But what hurts me, to twist rape culture even further. These men, they may be few in number, use the religion to justify treating women like shit, like their personal target for ridicule and violence if they don't meet ridiculous standards. And if a woman is a non-Muslim, suddenly all of the ""the Prophet (saw) treated his wives with respect, Islam gave women rights"" stuff just vanishes into thin air. It's not just that she's a slut, and somehow inferior. 

I've heard it time and time again, I've heard brothers coming out of the same khutba that I was in, come out and talk about dating a non-Muslim girl but marrying a 'pure' Muslim one. This is degrading to both the non-Muslim women, who are frankly treated like a hole to be filled, and Muslim ones, who are treated like objects that'll give you the Muslim kids and get you into heaven. 

I've heard Imams scold women for being a fitna for men

I've heard mothers reinforce this Madonna/whore stereotype by telling their sons not to look at so and so

I cannot speak to the hatred that seems to exist in Muslim men in England towards non-Muslim women. Thankfully

“Do not be people without minds of your own saying that if others treat you well you will treat them well

Based on the above, with which we abide by and need not lower ourselves to their standards. We even have rules of respectful engagements with prisoners of war! During the Prophet’s (pbuh) time, when a Muslim was captured, he was tortured, beaten, murdered and even mutilated, but the Prophet (pbuh) never returned this type of behavior towards non-Muslim prisoners. And if you have trouble understanding or believing any of the above

So enough of your emotional arguments rooted in ignorance and more practicing the faith with actual knowledge and understanding. You can never truly understand your religion unless you sit at the feet of the scholars, whom he takes everything else from, a sell out! This goes further to show that these guys are not really rooted in knowledge or understanding of their faith but are infected with serious emotional problems, ignorance of basic principles of their religion, and wanting to fulfill their false fantasies of adventure and danger.

It is also interesting to note that during the Prophet (pbuh) life,  advised him to have him killed, he [“turned down his proposal on the grounds that it did not become of a Prophet (Peace be upon him) to be accused of killing his people.”](http://abdurrahman.org/seerah/SN/sealednectar/30.html)  This goes further to show that the Prophet (pbuh) did not want people to have a bad image of Islam and Muslims including himself. This notion is even more clearly stated in the following narration from his wife Aisha:

“The Messenger of Allah, I heard Aisha say that the Messenger of Allah said on that day, ‘So the Jews will know that there is flexibility in our religion; verily, I have been sent with a lenient, upright religion.’” [Musnad Ahmad, Number 24333, Sahih](https://www.facebook.com/DailyHadithOnline/posts/482035315151529)

The Jews are pointed out specifically in this version of the narration while in [other versions](http://islamport.com/cgi-bin/w/alb/search.cgi?zoom_query=%C3%E4+%DD%ED+%CF%ED%E4%E4%C7+%DD%D3%CD%C9&amp;zoom_per_page=10&amp;zoom_and=1&amp;zoom_sort=0), wake up and get your act together!

I'm taking two university classes, and the Professors recommended reading some excerpts of the Qur'an and hadith to get some extra insight and background on the courses' subject matter. So I bought an English translation of the Qur'an (M.A.S Abdel Haleem- Oxford edition) and have been reading through it for the past week.

* Life had no meaning when I was an Atheist. I had to live the *""American Dream""* which is not something I was after

* I found that many western Media sources have anti-Islamic views; since the dawn of Media. I've always wondered where the ""live and let live"" approach was when it came to Muslims. If you're thinking ""But terrorists are what Islam leads to"". I'll come out and say 1.7billion Muslims out there

* Also, NLP, Hypnosis, subconscious behavior, was intrigued by the messages the Media would slip at subliminal levels that held strong anti Islamic views. 

Example: [Aladdin](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SV04ilOvJY)

* I've also taken interest in ancient civilizations. Why were they advanced beyond their times? How was there accurate astronomical calculations? They were precise and it was impossible with the naked eye to come up with the calculations that they did (they being advanced civilizations globally such as the Pharaohs, early civilizations in Cambodia etc. 

* Overnight boom in Sumerians agriculture system, the use of wheels, their proper astronomical depiction. It all came to that part of the world ""out of nowhere"", and the best reason has been (up until now) [Aliens](http://gatesthecomic.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Giorgio-Tsoukalos-hal-hefner-ancient-aliens.jpg). 

* Where as the Quran has specific mentions of these areas, none of these amazing ancient civilizations lived to explain their history, they all became ""extinct"".

* Sacred geometry symbols that have been omitted from most historic text books, check it out.

I found most *people* explaining these phenomenons were not fully satisfying

* I found Religion (in general) is receiving negative publicity

* I found many virtues and statements to live a good life can be found in Islam. Since adopting it, with lots of drugs and alcohol in my system. (I still believe everyone has the free choice to do what they will, I will not come to someone and blatantly say ""you're going to hell because...*reasons*"". I have no right to blatantly judge someone).

* Judgement day signs (the small ones) most have a check mark next to them on the list. The are depicted with fair accuracy. 

* There are many other reasons

Hope this helps. Yes the points I made in essence can all be wrong, and justice will be served.

**Update**: Thanks for the positive feedback everyone. Jazakkom Allah Khayr Jamee'an. Please continue to strengthen your faith. If you feel that you can do more good deeds that help your family

For those not satisfied with the answers I have given, and all the nations would be Religious &amp; Faithful if I had the hard proof answers.

* I have raised points that have helped me find my faith. I encourage you to continue research on these points that are unanswered by science. Please view as many sources from as many cultures

* As I stated earlier with my disclaimer towards the end

When people insult him by putting trash infront of his door and wishing death upon him, understanding and extreme tolerance.

I dare to bet that if you'd ask him about the ""Muhammad pictures"" issue he'd just say ""Don't give it any attention"" and that would be the end of it.

This man

As an atheist I was surprised to find out that Muhammad was so extremely tolerant and cool with his ""haters"" so how come some Muslims believe that he needs to be defended against all forms and shapes of insults?

I almost find that notion condescending since it implies that Muhammad was a sensitive and petty man who needs to be defended nonstop to not have his fragile ego hurt. 

I have seen no evidence that supports that Muhammad was a sensitive and petty man

So whence commeth the anger?

Please enlighten me :)

I was brought up in a very Christian home.  Church every Sunday morning, that I was sinning for questioning things.  I was a kid!  I didn't understand what they were teaching me.  I didn't understand how it could be wrong to ask for someone to explain to me why we believed this or that.  I learned quickly to shut my mouth and just deal with it. 


Years later, etc.)  They were not my friends, I just knew them.  They were two of the meanest women I have personally come across.  Both had killed people, for whatever reason. (I do not know who they killed or why they killed them.)  Suffice it to say, every time I saw them, they were rude, obnoxious, scary.  They never gave ME any trouble.  Nobody usually ever does.  I knew of these women for a couple of years.


One day


I approached one of the two girls. I asked her what caused this drastic change and she said she converted to Islam.  I just nodded.  I had no real idea what it meant.  She was very happy


I mentioned the Quran to my mother one day.  She told me it was full of lies and hate, could I look at it . . . she did, and she allowed me to look at it. I paged through it, reading verses here and there.  I was shocked!  It mentioned prophets that I knew of from the Bible!  What little I read that day spoke of love and peace and kindness.  I never saw anything about hate and evil and cruelty.  My Mama was wrong.  I thanked the girl and gave her back her Quran.  I wanted to ask her more questions, but  I was still scared of her.  


A couple of years went by.  I was trying to find my place and I couldn't.  I was not content, but I have a child.  (That is a horrible story, not a long one, but horrible nonetheless) So, I quit attending church.  Even reading my Bible never truly brought me any peace.  I felt as though my prayers were going unheard.  I didn't know what to do, I didn't know who to talk to . . .  


I quit going out with the friends I had, either, I just knew it wasn't right for me.    I began a Facebook.  


I wound up meeting a handful of people that would wind up being like brothers and sisters to me.  They happened to be Muslim.  They didn't ""preach"" at me or try to shove Islam down my throat as all the Christians always tried to do, I saw how they were like that girl I knew . . . and every time I talked with them, it was in my mind and in my heart . . . why don't I ask them how to convert to Islam.   I was afraid, though.  This went against what I was taught growing up.  It was different from my family, different from my friends.  Very different from my community.  


I was afraid to convert even though I KNEW without a doubt that it was the RIGHT thing to do.  I was afraid I would be disowned by my family.  I was most afraid my Mama would quit speaking to me altogether.  She was what we call a ""die-hard Christian.""


It was on my mind day and night.  I couldn't stop thinking about it.   Wasn't it more important to do what God (this was how I was thinking that day) wanted for me?  I knew the answer was yes.  I decided to stop waiting, my heart felt so much lighter, I felt so much peace, and it's never ended.  I always feel this way.  I'm still new and I still don't know a lot.  Honestly, I really do not know much at all.


Allah, my Muslim friends, are what helped me make it through the death of my Mama this 2 March.  I won't say I didn't cry, because I did . . . I won't say that once in a while I don't cry, because once in a while I do . . . but if it weren't for Allah, I would be lost in grief.  I am not the perfect . . . muslima? . . . not as I'd like to be . . .


I feel alone sometimes because, not to my knowledge.  The nearest mosque is a 2 hour drive (one way).  Most of this town, if not all, are Christian.  And the friends I have here, in this town, I keep them at a distance.

1335277647.0,spzfe,Convert Stories Thread.,hiddenmuslimah,119,15,146,"Asalam Alaikum Brothers and Sisters

I wanted to start this thread because I feel like most converts had a tough time getting to where they are today as Muslims. It's empowering to hear these stories as well as share my own about the trials and tribulations Allah has set for us Alhamdulilah, and insha'Allah, whoever else wants to share, please share, I love to hear your stories.

My story starts about 4 years ago, as a result I was born and raised in Canada. I have one brother who is 2 years older than I am. We are very close Alhamdulilah.

I used to be a partier, typical teenager stuff. My brother was the same, we used to go to house parties together and hangout with our friends. I was very popular and accepted everyone, I was also very involved at school, teachers loved me, I was strong academically. 

My story begins one night when I was out partying at a house party, it became really crowded and I didn't know a lot of people that were coming in. I paid no mind and kept drinking until I was barely coherent. I was still aware of my surroundings but things were slow moving and I was woozy. A guy began hitting on me, and I welcomed it, as was my usual routine. He was pretty tall and built, he looked like he played football. I danced with him for a bit and then he lead me upstairs and I followed. I don't want to get into too much detail at this point, as it is difficult even now, 4 years later

He made a move and I rejected it, but he continued until I had to kick him off of me. At this point he became angry and forced me down, I began screaming and he choked me. I don't remember much after that, everything went black. I woke up in the same room, my brother sitting over me, his eyes were teary and his jaw was swollen, and there was blood. I knew he must've fought the guy, and at that point I knew I had been raped. 

What followed this tragic event in my life was years of depression and insomnia. I became reserved, and I was suicidal. My brother didn't speak about it, he was messed up like me, maybe even more because he saw it happen. I used to stare at the ceiling for hours non-stop. I avoided going to school and my friends would call my phone and I would just let it ring. As time went by I progressed through my extreme depression to a non-responsive reservation where I was physically with people, but mentality I wasn't there. My parents took me to doctors, but I would blow it off, make up excuses. The most painful part of the rape was not being able to do anything about it. If I called the cops, though we seldom talked. 

This went on for two years, and it was odd to me that he was up at that obscure time. I listened to him go into the washroom and turn on the tap and it was on for at least 2 minutes. Weird. He left the bathroom and went into his room. I was up because I couldn't sleep, so I thought I'd go in to talk to him. I approached his door which was open just a crack and peered in at him. He was standing with his hands over his rib cage, looking down and whispering to himself. I watched for another minute, and as soon as he prostrated I knew what he was doing. I threw the door open all the way and scowled at him. He sat up fast, and looked in my direction. He sighed a little, in relief I think? I was visibly upset and I started shouting at him. He shushed me and I kept going on asking him what the hell he was doing and why. He put his hand over my mouth and tried to calm me down a little. I started choking up, tears began forming. For the first time in a long time I cried.

It's sad that I've been reduced to less than human and I ""deserve"" because I choose to follow Allah swt. It's sad that I face discrimination because I wear hijab. And it really makes me disappointed in American people who blindly follow the media and say loudly ""God bless America, and others are making good effort to understand, but I'm just sad that my dad turned out to be that way.

This past summer I was placed in jail for a couple of months, while in there, I became friends with a group of muslims, one being a convert from catholicism, and the religion really appealled to me. Also, while in jail, I would regularly attend church, and the emphasis they placed on believing in Jesus or you are going to hell

So, and religion being my minor (history my major) I decided to take a course in Islam. The course really opened my eyes, as I am from Southern Alberta, Canada, and we are generally close minded people, with a huge christian base, and everyone here only believes what they see in the media (which is absolutely terrible). Since this class I have become close with my professor, and have begun to love the religion. Everything about it fascinates me. I love the teachings of Muhammad.

What has begun to bother me though, but when it comes to the rest of my family, they constantly ridicule me for it, and take it as a joke. Especially when I was learning the Arabic alphabet, and reciting it outloud, they made fun of me. (the class I am in now is Islamic art and science, and we have been learning calligraphy) 

Are there any catholics, that have converted when their family is devout in their previous religion?

And are there any tips that any Muslims may have?


Also, and I absolutely love it!!!

EDIT: I have taken many of your comments to heart, Shariah and Ulama, and more on the interpretation I guess you could say. 

It is nice to hear so many people who have converted to reply

Another question, for example, giving certain things up like pork and alcohol, Ramadan, or the 5 daily prayers?

A question for born Muslims, what were some of your greatest temptations, such as drinking or eating pork, or hanging with friends instead of prayer? One question I asked my professor was had he ever tried veggie bacon, and he kinda laughed and asked if they actually made it, and yeah they do because my fiance eats it, so he said he does not know if he would ever eat it, and would have difficulty placing it in a category,self,

While I was young my mother would read the Bible to me and I would attend church. This would die off over the years due to the family being busy.
I never had anything against Islam as far as I remember but I remember I didn't know anything on it at all. About a year ago I decided to learn about the world's various major faiths. I was tired of people burning Qurans saying Islam was a religion of hate so I decided to start with Islam. I bought a Quran and read the first couple of chapters over a period of a few months.
I finally quit my job and was able to attend Dr. Mazhar Kazi's (father of Yasir Qadhi) Islam classes at the Islamic Center of Greater Houston on Sundays (I always worked on Sundays and could never go.)
After three classes I was invited over to Dr. Kazi's house for dinner where he invited some other people who joined Islam. We had a deep discussion on my view on my faith. I kinda wanted to convert but was a bit in a halfway point. 
The next day when I awoke I had the great urge to join Islam. So a bit over a week later
I was a bit scared of what my family would think of me afterwords but God has blessed me with a caring and loving family.

1362941886.0,1a19z7,Silence on Iraq.,controlledascension,127,30,111,"Salaam. I am an Iraqi/American

Very few people know what is really going on in Iraq right now. Many media outlets in the U.S. simply refuse to talk about it. The impression that this gives to the American people is that Iraq is no longer relevant - now, people have no problem with it, and the war is totally over. Sure, there are a few suicide bombings here and there, but they're starting to die down.

None of you is at fault if you do not know Iraq's true current situation.

In late December 2012, Mosul, Tikrit, Samarra, Hawija, Kirkuk, and so on (even Baghdad, I believe) was named the ""Friday of Honor."" There are literally million(s) of people out on the streets in peaceful demonstration against the current Iraqi government. These demonstrations, Egypt

Now

Aside from phrases like ""foreign occupation"" and ""corrupt politics"" I'll try to describe this to you. The Iraqi government forces regularly, targeting the demographic of (Sunni young men - these are the people most likely to oppose the government) and, without charges, drag dozens of people away to locations that aren't revealed. They're detained into Iraq's prisons. Iraq's prisons are filled with things like neglect, mistreatment, brutal torture, and - in the women's prisons - even rape, these prisons are filled mostly with innocent people.

This might be the worst brutality of Maliki's government. Not to say there aren't many others

Now let's look at how the government has handled the peaceful demonstrations. The demonstrations are mostly Sunni (the current Iraqi government is Shi'a-led), they keep cutting off all the roads to split up the districts, and prevent unified Friday prayers. This is what happens in most of the cities. A thick distribution of government forces, with the military surrounding the demonstrators, denying them entry to the mosques on Fridays and blocking off cities to non-residents. In Mosul, just yesterday, the Federal Police opened fire on the demonstrators

January 25, some people shout ""where are the police?!"". Also, some policemen resigned after hearing about this, and joined the demonstrations. Granted, the local police might not be the *best* of people, but they can't compare to the military or special forces.

Speaking of that, some time ago). Gunmen have gunned down these sheikhs and imams and later been seen passing freely through numerous government checkpoints.

So that's what I wanted to say. I'm not asking for anything but recognition. I don't even live in Iraq. I just don't want your eyes to glaze over it on a map, if you can, spread the news.

Shukran.

-Allows us to question it
-No concept of original sin (one of the main problems I had with Christianity) 
-Less contradictions compared to the bible
-Qu'ran is not really meant as a bible or reference

-If somebody leaves Islam
-Supposedly we get 72 virgins or something if we go to heaven? Or is this misrepresented in the media?

&gt;Islam didn't murder the man in Woolwich. It was perverse criminals using religion to rationalize their indefensible barbarism

**Wajahat Ali** (https://twitter.com/WajahatAli/status/337321893919076352)

&gt;A man was hacked to death in broad daylight in the name of Allah. What has the world come to? What kind of exposure to Islam drives a person to kill. Who are such people exposed to that they feel justified in carrying out murder? The man even came up to a camera to rant about what he had done and make out like he was doing it in the name of Allah and to defend Muslims.He murders a man in cold blood and then takes Allah's name. What a disgrace and what an insult to Allah! 

&gt;Please be vigilant as one extremist's action is another extremist's fuel. Already extremists have come out and tried to take advantage of this and divide our community. They will not succeed inshaAllah. 

&gt;Not only do I condemn this act

&gt;Our thoughts and condolences go out to the family of the victim.

**Shams Adduha Muhammad** (https://www.facebook.com/shamsadduha/posts/201633613318502)

&gt;'Woolwich murder' can only be perpetrated by someone not right in their head... Just makes life difficult for us 'normal' Muslims!

**Muhammad ibn Adam al-Kawthari** (https://twitter.com/Mufti_Muhammad_/status/337341560708534274)

&gt;So

&gt;- Two murderers had the gall to pollute the minds of hundreds of millions of people by shouting the sacred words of ""Allah is Great"" whilst doing nothing great

&gt;- They slashed a man to death whilst quoting BIBLICAL passages.

&gt;- They do this and then walk around the manor as if they were shopping in the shampoo aisle of the local supermarket.

&gt;- An act which was clearly meant to terrorise everyone has just confused everyone instead.

&gt;- Thus what is clearly an act of isolated deranged criminal freakishness has been magically transformed into a Muslim terrorist invasion of Great Britain. Obviously.

&gt;- Who's signed up to ""defend their country"" against said invasion? The English Dummies League - a motley crew of true criminal terrorist thugs who worryingly don't know their pint glasses from their a****. #EDLthat

&gt;This is just ridiculous. Time to move on. Where's Premier League Football when you need it?

While this is a correct answer as the Qur'an and ahadeeth are the two main resources of Islamic knowledge

I felt so bad for that poor army soldier who posted asking for where there was peace in the Qur'an because all he hears where he is at is the violence. So many just posted ""read the Qur'an"" instead of listing specific verses or surahs. As if he has time and understanding to ponder over the whole thing and figure it out for himself. If he did

Context and tafsir are important too! I saw that one redditor did post a specific verse but unfortunately it was taken out of context and the wrong part of the verse was focused upon.

Weak anecdotal evidence taken as a general standard. Ad hominem and straw men arguments. **Arguing without *edeb*.** (And in a lot of cases

It's a turn-off, teeny, tiny internet forum is, really, a microcosm of all that.

Threads and posts just throwing around *fatawa* like it's confetti at a wedding; saying this person or sheikh or Redditor or that idea or whatever is *kufr* and just throwing around the Haraam Hammer like you're Thor; non-stop arguments baiting atheists or about atheism; and 100 threads dedicated to the same asinine conversation that, it still wouldn't register with some of you.

There is so much more we all could be doing with our lives than argue about things that, for example, if you want to be *zahid*--or more conservative--then be conservative with yourself and leave others as long as what they are doing is permissible within Islam.) And this subreddit could be so much more than what it is. (Meaning, just because something happened in the Muslim World geographically, doesn't necessarily means it belongs in this subreddit.)

The more I see people attacking Islam with such passion the more i get drawn to learn more.

I must admit though; few years back it was fun (even for me) to make fun of Muslims and their belief but as i started to learn more i found more flaws in my Christian church belief than in Islam.

I considered atheism first then I started reading here and elsewhere about evidence of GOD that I always think of.

I do not believe atheism is the answer. That is my feeling.

&gt; Religions

I have been always a supporter for the Palestinian cause (the west is very bias against them) when I started asking questions about them I could not believe that some of the answers I got from people of my church is that the sooner Palestine is wiped out the sooner our lord will come. I was speechless. So I stopped going to church and started reading about the faith of Islam among other religions.

I learned about the sharia and first I though it was terrible.. then again I learned it was in the bible all this time but we were told that did not mean anything.

That got me more intrigued into Islam.. I remember there were nights i stayed up reading most of the night fascinated with the teachings of Islam.

There was something holding me though. I could not put my hand on it. I think it was not time yet.

Today I came checking on /r/Islam and saw the same people here that come daily to attack Islam pointing out how many Muslims leave Islam. That reminded me of that I met a nun in my old church that later became a Muslim.

It may have been the nudge i needed and now i feel a strong rush of my blood and my heart pumping hard as I take the decision to declare that I TOTALLY BELIEVE THAT THERE IS NO GOD BUT THE ALMIGHTY GOD ALLAH

I know this is going to be tough for my family to accept. But I have made up my mind and May Allah help me.

EDIT: I can not believe how many atheists here have been posting and PMing me hoping to change my mind. it's like vultures here. Same names I see for the past few months but this time coming after me.

1350226712.0,11gmty,The Prophet (saws) &amp; the Alcoholic,tazb,104,21,37,"There was a man named `Abd Allah who loved Allah and His Messenger so much that the Prophet (peace be upon him) had to declare about him: ""Indeed

This man named `Abd Allah so loved the Prophet (peace be upon him) that he used to delight in presenting the Prophet with any delicacy that came to Medina, when the seller demanded payment, `Abd Allah would bring the seller to the Prophet and say: ""Give this man its price."" 

The Prophet (peace be upon him) would then say: ""Didn't you give it to me as a gift?"" 

`Abd Allah would say: ""Yes

The two of them would laugh together and then the Prophet (peace be upon him) would have the merchant paid. 

This was the type of close and jovial relationship that `Abd Allah and the Prophet had with each other. 

It remains to be said that `Abdullah was an alcoholic. He would often become so drunk that he had to be brought staggering through the streets before the Prophet (peace be upon him) to be sentenced for public drunkenness

After `Abd Allah had departed from one of these all too frequent sentencings

The Prophet (peace be upon him): rebuked that Companion, if you only knew just how very much indeed he loves Allah and His Messenger."" [Sahîh al-Bukhârî (6282)] He then added: ""Do not help Satan against your brother."" 

We can learn a lot from the Prophet's attitude. 

We should reflect first upon the close and affectionate relationship this Companion enjoyed with the Prophet (peace be upon him), of being his friend, and joking with him. 

This shows us that in the society envisioned by the Prophet (peace be upon him) people were not segregated into the pious and the sinners, inclusive society, where each person could be at a different level of piety. Some were at the forefront of righteousness, some were moderately pious, while others were prone to fall into sin. However, no one lived aloof from society, nor was anyone shunned. Everyone remained part of society. 

This inclusiveness meant that when some members of society fell into error, there was no end of brotherly support from others in society who were more than willing to lend a helping hand and get that person back on track. 

Another lesson the Prophet's conduct shows us is the importance of maintaining a positive outlook. In spite of the fact that `Abd Allah was frequently being summoned before the Prophet (peace be upon him) for public drunkenness, we find that it was not something unique for `Abd Allah, but a quality that all believers have in common. Nevertheless, the Prophet (peace be upon him) chose to praise `Abd Allah for this reason. In doing so, the Prophet could cultivate, encourage, and strengthen this quality in everyone. He also reminded them that if someone slips up

We can imagine how `Abd Allah must have felt when he learned that the Prophet (peace be upon him) said this about him. He must certainly felt it as an immense honor to have Allah's Messenger declare this about him. It served to help him overcome his bad habit and gave him hope

It was the Prophet's way to point out the good qualities of those who sinned and fell into error. We sometimes forget this, by contrast, inspires virtue. When reminded of `Abd Allah's frequent drunkenness, he boasted of that man's possessing the greatest virtue of loving Allah and His Messenger. 

Finally, after the Prophet had the prescribed sentence carried out upon `Abd Allah for his public drunkenness, he did not seek anything further against him. He saw any further reprimand to be helping Satan against the man. Rather, he turned everyone's attention to his merits that compensate for his shortcomings. 

This should give us pause, but we still have no hesitations about railing against our opponents with everything in our verbal arsenal. How far this is from the example set by the Prophet (peace be upon him), who when faced with a person committing an obvious sin, still found it better to speak good about that person. He still kept up his good relationship with that person, despite his shortcomings. 

The Prophet's conduct with `Abd Allah is an excellent example for us, wholesome, and nurturing, bonds which can serve to dissuade people from falling into sin.

Then 10 years ago, and then every Muslim around was seen as a threat by the US media. Let me emphasise that this was the accounts from the US media that swamped the channels. This was hardly the stance of India.

[The Booklet (PDF)](http://media.rasoulallah.net/rasoulallah.net/Why-did-Prophet-Muhammad-Marry-Aisha-the-Young-GirlEN.pdf)

TLDR for this book and other sources:

1. The kind of marriage between girls 8-9 to men 50-60 was common throughout the world.

2. If it was something perverted or out of the ordinary

3. The idea was not the prophet's in the first place; a woman he knew (by the name of Kholah bint Hakim) suggested Aisha to him.

4. The purpose of the marriage was not pleasure. The prophet never married anyone else as young as her. In fact, he would've married many of them during the peak of his youth and manhood, before the enormous pressures and pains of prophethood and all the wars, politics, and troubles that go with it, including his older age.

5. The reason he married Aisha? To strengthen the bond between himself and his closest

6. These ""bond marriages"" were common then and still common today, and sometimes just for the purpose of bonding for more tight-knit communities, e.g. a city is comprised mainly of three main tribes, so they inter-marry so the whole city would practically become like one family.

7. The prophet married other women for the same reason. For instance, after which Abu Sufian's enmity greatly subsided and hatred and wars between Makkah and Madinah lessened.

8. Aisha was already considered of marriage age: she was engaged to another man by the name of Jubair bin Mut'im before her marriage to the prophet. 

9. The prophet married a woman by the name of Sowdah bint Zamo'ah, to strengthen the community, and so forth.",,False,self,t5_2qhbp,,http://www.reddit.com/r/islam/comments/mmias/why_did_muhammad_marry_a_nineyearold_girl/

The Muslims of the Golden Age were literate, if you have a religious look, perform the basic rituals habitually, and shun anything not deemed ""religious,"" then you are respected. I don't think this is what Muhammad intended. (salalaahu alayhi wa sallam) And sometimes at a lecture or muhadarah, you ask a question and you get such a bad answer (even from people who are purportedly VERY well educated in Islam.) It just seems like scholars aren't willing to develop an understanding of the cultures within which they preach.

Religion in the hands of the ignorant is very dangerous. I respect the people who wanted to get away from Islam because it was being so terribly misrepresented to them (by mixing it with oppressive cultural values alien to Islam). I feel like if I can't speak Arabic and read the classical sources fluently, drug addicts) then we are just pretending to be Muslims. Let's not kid ourselves. We aspire to be Muslims and it is an honor to live by the chivalrous code of Islam but we fall so short that it's like we're making fun of it by saying we're a part of it.

What I would like to see more of:

1. Be good to your family
2. Serve others and take helping the downtrodden seriously
3. Make sure you're on the right track to becoming fluent in Arabic
4. Don't try to seek out people to ""convert"" to Islam when 99% of the people who were born Muslims have no clue what the religion even requires. Go to them and educate them about manners and serving others. Our rituals are hollow if we don't understand them and if we aren't surrounding them with service to others.

He was probably dead on arrival, chest tube, etc... eventually they called his time of death, the resuscitation room quickly emptied out until it was just me and him.

Out of curiosity, when the blood starts to pool and the skin becomes pale, it becomes difficult to ascertain a person's true skin color (and hence, ethnicity). However, when I read his name, I knew he was a muslim.

I was shook because I finally understood the pain of mother losing a child. Although I did not know the gentleman

I'm making a sincere intention that for the sake of Allah SWT and for the sake of teaching others about our way of life that we get a FAQ section in the sidebar organized and working. Since it's being (largely) ignored by much of the community and has only been mentioned in short bursts


**These are things we have right now:**

* r/IslamFAQ
* we have an open IRC channel
* we have a FREE voice/text chat network available through br deebstr called Socal United Muslims (SCUM)
* theDailyMuslimRage actually does [amazing da'wah](http://slacktory.com/2012/02/muslims-are-making-rage-comics-on-reddit/) mA!


**Possible objectives (rough ideas):**

* A few people (NOTE: few) to create an outline. Preferably those with experience in da'wah (spreading the message of Islam through invitation not solicitation). These can link to videos
* A large group of dedicated individuals to hunting down content and submitting it. These can be submitted gradually (like 3-5 posts a week).
* A team to cross-reference submitted posts and review submissions
* Probably the most important: select a team lead (my vote is h4qq if he's not too busy).

**This is a serious concern of mine and some other people who have expressed the same feelings. I think it's absolutely critical for the success

**Please do not volunteer if you are extremely busy and have many many other commitments. The last thing you want to do is take on too much and spread yourself thin.**

Allah is the pivot of the Muslim faith. Islam’s holy scripture, his inaccessible mystery, his various names, and his actions on behalf of his creatures. Three themes preponderate: (1) Allah is the Creator, Judge, and Rewarder; (2) he is unique (wahid) and inherently one (ahad); and (3) he is omnipotent and all-merciful. Allah is the “Lord of the Worlds,” the Most High; “nothing is like unto him
  
Allah,” and two passages in the Qur'an express a mutual love between him and humanity, but the Jewish and Christian precept to “love God with all thy heart” is nowhere formulated in Islam. The emphasis is rather on Allah’s inscrutable sovereignty, to which one must abandon oneself. In essence, the “surrender to Allah” (Islam) is the religion itself.  
  
Allah can be best described in the following Qur'anic chapter:

I've taken a history course on Islam

The Mogul Empire was an fascinating study! While most Islamic high courts allowed a wide array of individuals

Some of my favorite figures, and Hadiths were great. :D), The legendary Akbar the Great, and his grandson, Shah Jahan, were very wise rulers.  Also the legendary traveler Ibn Battuta was an extremely interesting individual!

I've heard that there are some Islamic scholars that are arguing for including Hindu's, and looking to grow as a religion.  

Oh man

Personal time. :(    I've gotten into heated debates with my father about Islam.. he is a pretty radical Christian.  Thinking about my first line, it pains me to talk to my father even to this day.  I've seen his eyes darken, his voice thicken on one more than one occasion.  He very literally just regurgitates what his radio pastures say.  Mind you, it wasn't just about Islam, but politics, social matters, and other general things.  I haven't even told him that I'm not a Christian... 

I strive to bring understanding and compassion to all, religious or atheist.  To spread a bit of wisdom, to bring peace.  Only through wisdom, through peace, can we hope to understand ourselves, and others.  Through compassion, we can look across the aisle, a opponent

http://www.reddit.com/r/islam/wiki/jihad_2

The above is the basis for the following regarding the attack in the UK on the former soldier: (In other words if you don't read that link

1. The verses on an eye for an eye refer to judicial sentences (death penalty for murder).
2. The British armed forces do not go around beheading people with knives in the middle of the street. This wasn't an ""eye for an eye"", an act of transgression and a failure in the logic of the person in the video. If we want to be literal, then the only way to commit an eye for an eye would be with an air force dropping bombs from the sky. Anything else is not truly ""an eye for an eye"" and thus becomes transgression (this isn't the Islamic view of warfare, it's just the flaw in this person's ""an eye for an eye"" reasoning).
3. The verse which says to fight them as they fight you does not override *every other verse in the Qur'an*. The clear understanding
4. Abu Bakr (ra), without question, cowardly. If you question whether such an act is cowardly, you may be a coward or you lack a total understanding of what honor means. And you probably do believe in honor (as many extremists do) so you should also realize you can't abandon honor in war. The Afghan Taliban let their entire country get overrun by an invasion so they wouldn't have to turn over a Muslim guest under their protection (OBL) to non-Muslims, not just because of Islamic rules, but because of their own culture and honor code: [Pashtunwali](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pashtunwali). So abandoning honor in any context is unacceptable by the reasoning of the ""warriors"" such people idolize. (Edit: regarding defining ""cowardly"" strictly to running away from the battlefield: this person had abandoned the battlefield by such a great distance that he was nowhere near Iraq or Afghanistan, hence he was a coward by that line of reasoning as well)
5. A clear hadith from the Book of Jihad in Sahih Muslim forbids mutilation. Killing someone and cutting up their body afterwards is mutilation. An actual beheading is where a person is executed by the act of beheading. A technical difference
6. The same hadith forbids treachery. As the BBC article link elaborates, renounce their citizenship, and take up the fight where it is actually taking place. The scholars saying this are from the same school of law in Islam as the Taliban and the most conservative Muslims in Asia, and this same school of thought was used in the Abbasid, Mughal, and Ottoman empires. This carries more weight than a random person off the street (or it should to a thinking person).

**Regarding coexistence with non-Muslims**

http://www.deoband.net/1/post/2008/02/tolerance-and-coexistence-with-non-muslims-in-islam.html

Allama Anwar Shah Kashmiri (ra) says: 

&gt; ""In India and in every non-Muslim majority country every Muslim is responsible as much as he can to maintain the rights of peace and freedom which Islam has allotted for common people. Obviously, wealth and belongings of common citizens. If a Muslim is only a spectator and keeps aloof from the political and economical activities of his country then how he can discharge the duty of serving the people.""

Maulana Syed Hussain Ahmad Madani (ra) said: 

&gt; ""We as Indians are integrated and have an alliance which perpetuates in all conditions along with the differences in religions and cultures. In the same way, colours and heights has no impact in our mutual humanity, we all are Indians as per holding same nationality. Hence, Muslims are equally dutiful like other communities to avail the national interests and make attempts to remove any kind of harm and damage. If the inhabitants of a village do not extinguish the fire together in case it catches, then the whole village will be engulfed by the fire and all people will be badly affected. Likewise, the inhabitants of a country, whether Muslims or Hindus, all are equally obligated to strain every nerve jointly to guard their country in case of national calamity. 
&gt;
&gt; This responsibility implies all and being different in religions causes no hindrance. Everyone can discharge this duty having full allegiance to their respective religions. The same collaboration is prevailing in municipal boards, a state or a country. This is what called 'composite nationalism'.

Maulana Syed Hussain Ahmad Madani (ra) also said

&gt; “If Muslims cannot form a nation with non-Muslims
…The view that Islam is an inflexible religion is beyond my comprehension. To the extent that I can understand its laws, tenancy, the exchange of gifts, loans, trusts, etc. Muslims can interact with them, participate in matters of joy and grief

If you don't know who these men are, even whilst they might disobey them.

According to Abu Sa'd (radiAllahu anhu), and she fasted frequently without his permission, which made her tired and prevented any opportunity for enjoying sexual relations during the day. The Prophet recommended that she limit her recitation to one surah and only fasted with her husbands permission so that they could enjoy each other. Similarly, when the Prophet [](/pbuh) heard that a zealous Companion, Abdullah ibn 'Amr (radiAllahu anhu), was in the habit of praying all night and fasting all day, he told him to moderate his devotions, your guests have a right over you

**Foreplay**

The Prophet [](/pbuh) said ""None of you should fall upon his wife like an animal; let there first be a messenger between you.""

The Sahaba (radiAllahu anhum) then asked ""And what is that oh messenger of Allah?""

He [](/pbuh) replied: ""Kisses and loving words"" (i.e. foreplay) (Daylami)

**Orgasm of a woman**

""Three things are counted inadequacies in a man. Firstly, rebuffing the generosity that another shows to him. And thirdly, going to his wife and having intercourse with her before talking to her and gaining her intimacy, and satisfying his need from her before she has satisfied her need from him."" (Daylami)

And Ibn Qudamah and Al Ghazzali (rahimahumullah) are of the opinion that it is *mustahabb* (recommended) for a man, out of love for her. And this is possible by continued coitus since the man does not lose his erection immediately after orgasm for some minutes. And if this is not enough he may stimulate her by hand or mouth. 

**Reward**

Narrated in Muslim

The Sahaba (radiAllahu anhum) replied: ""Oh Messenger of God! When one of us fulfils his sexual desire

""Today I went to First Baptist Church of _________ to volunteer. They were having a feed the homeless event and I signed up to help as a student from Iota Kappa Chi which is the nursing club at ________ College. After serving food to several people, came up to me and told me she had to ask me to leave and that I am not allowed to help out. I asked 'why not?' And she says because they are a Christian church and therefore cant allow ""someone like me"" to be there and help out. I told her it was not as if I was imposing my beliefs on anyone, I just wanted to help feed the homeless but she wouldn't have it. I was completely speechless and did not know what to since I haven't dealt with such Islamophobia especially being completely alone and not knowing anyone at the church. So with tears in my eyes, I went outside and headed towards my car.
I was going to leave but then I realized I did not have to accept being treated with such intolerance from anyone. Who was that lady to tell me to leave just because I'm a Muslim. So I wipe away my tears and walked back into the church. I asked another lady who was in charge and she pointed to 'Linda', that we both believe in God and Jesus. She then said the most ignorant thing ever. She said ""No, the Jesus and God you believe in are different than the ones we believe in."" I told her If someone wanted to help Jesus with something, I'm sure he wouldn't reject them just because they not christian. She agreed but still wouldn't let me help. I realized how ignorant she was of her own religion so I couldn't blame her for being ignorant of Islam. So I told her I wanted speak to whoever was in charge of the church. She told me the pastor was in charge but he wasn't there today so I asked for his contact information. She went and got me the church's business card and I left.
It is 2013 and I live in Southern California which is one of the most diverse places in the US so I never thought I would the be recipient of such tolerance, they will be having a service. I am going to go there and see if I can talk to the pastor. If the pastor can make things right then Alhamdulillah, but if not then further action will be taken. I'm writing this experience just to make everyone aware of how intolerant people are even though we are in 2013. Experiences like these just make me proud to be a Muslim and make me stronger because it motivates me to stand up for what's right. I make dua that Allah makes something positive come out of this.""",,False,self,t5_2qhbp,,http://www.reddit.com/r/islam/comments/1ht5sc/a_dear_friend_of_mine_volunteered_at_a_church_to/

Wasalmolaqum warahmatalah whobarakatu, cigarettes, drink alcohol, sell drugs, please learn from my mistakes. You are so blessed to have found Islam at a young age, and Islam in general.

I used to make more money selling drugs in a month than the average person did in 2 years. I was buying take-out food everyday, and bought a beautiful car, 

but there was one thing that I could not buy

As i have converted to the most beautiful religion, and reading the most sacred writings of allah, sent by  muhammad sallah wa allayhum wasallam, I became a changed man, there is no denying I am a changed mans, 

these are only some ways islam has changed my life, there are changes that are so amazing, that it is unwritable, i cannot speak about it.

- I have found new friends who are there to make fun, to sit down and tell stories, make a campfire and some smoke there argilla (flavored tobacco), some drink shay(tea) its a wonderful environment.

- I have become a much nicer

- I have more patience than i could have thought i ever have

- I do not judge people in any sense

- I help out as many people as i can

- I am more relaxed

- I go to school

- Girls are my friends now

- My mother and father are proud of me

- i am proud of myself, and what i did I am happy because it has created, moulded the person I have become.

Another thing I have come to realise is that of course islam helps the inner peace, in every religion there is some people that will be good, good at the heart, and some people who are bad. even though there are some muslim i see who like to stare, and who give dirty looks and are mean people, there are the NICEST muslim who are wonderful, appreciate, Just like there are kafirin who are the same

 About two or three years ago I had a friend who was a devout Atheist. He always would talk about how science disproved Allah (SWT) and me, I myself declared that I was an Atheist for a short period of time. About a year or so later I took shahada again but not because I truly believed in God, but because that's what was expected of me. Only a handful of people knew that I had become an Atheist. 

Recently I've become more curious about the religion and have been active in the community and praying 5 times a day etc. 

Anyway, and they are the ones astray."" This has truly shaken me on the inside. Is that it for me? If someone can shed some light here, that would be great!

You think these people don't know that? A person asks about a perspective or advice on something and an non-muslim person strolls along as if they were asked about their opinion. Of course we know that we can go have sex. Of course we know we can marry non-muslims. Of course we know we can go drink alcohol and smoke weed. But we don't because God has told us to. Then we ask our fellow brothers some advice on it

Of course this is not pointed towards all atheists. There have been plenty kind and respectful ones. I even saw someone say ''I'm not muslim but I heard the muslim perspective on [x] is...'' which I found beautiful because it shows you do have an own opinion

Also if you're not a muslim

You are free to participate in other discussions and give your views and such, that's okay. But don't make a directly reply to the thread. Make a reply to the comment you have a problem with. Or make a reply saying ''I know Islam says x, but I disagree because of y.'' Don't start talking as if you are representing the Islamic advice. We know we can get ex-muslim/atheist/buddhist advice too, but we're asking for a Fatwa by an Islamic scholar.

1) Denying that Quran-alone Muslims are Muslims.  My understanding is that Abu-Bakr, but frankly, some are just vile.  And I'm keeping my pubes and my armpit hair, thanks.  If ahadith are secondary, and the Qur'an is complete and fully detailed, why do a lot of Muslims not like the ""Quraniyoon""?

2) Sunnah: yes, but the claim that ""this is how Muslims have always prayed, so this must be how the prophet taught us to pray"" seems questionable.

3) Culture: I'm not going to pepper my conversations with ""inshallah"" and ""alhamdulillah"".  It is annoying enough when my Christian friends throw in ""praise the lord"" and ""halleluyah"" for good measure.  If I want to say ""God willing"" I'll just say ""God willing.""  I'm not growing a beard.  I'm married to a feisty

4) Sunni vs. Shi'a: Honestly, this is an issue I'd avoid altogether, and frankly, as someone who lives in a secular democracy (unless, God forbid, Santorum is elected), it seems to be an irrelevant question about whether or not someone is Sunni or not.

Sura 81: The Rolling Up

In the name of God

When the sun is rolled up

and when the stars fall lusterless

and when the mountains are blown away

and when the pregnant camels are neglected

and when the wild beasts are herded

and when the oceans are flooded

and when the souls are matched

and when the infant girl who was buried is asked

for what offense she was killed;



And when the pages are opened

and when the sky is stripped

and when the blaze is fired up

and the dawn as it breaks

endowed with power

So your companion is not insane --

he saw him on the clear horizon.

And he isn't grudging with the unseen;

and this isn't the word of an accursed devil.

So where are you going?

for any of you who want to be upright.


But you won't want to unless it is the will of God

Whether you call yourself a Salafi or you are obessesed with Al-Albani, Muhammad ibn Abdul Wahhab, (and I guess to a larger extent Ibn Tamiyyah) or you only take sources from islamqa.com (or any of the other sites they have) - this rant is for you.

I also listen to non-Salafi scholars too.  I respect them and appreciate them too.  They also have taught me a lot and helped me a lot.

BUT

There is a problem in our ummah. From Pakistan to Mali.  From Indonesia to America.  Extremists exists.  Extremists Muslims who probably would not hesitate to kill us all because we don't follow their way.

Al-Qaeda and other extremists have a lot in common with Salafis.  In fact some could argue they are salafis.  They all listen and follow the same scholars.  They all love Ibn Taymiyah and quoting him.  They all love Al-Aqida Al-Wasitiyah.  They all love to hate on non-Salafis especially the Sufi and Shia.

To me the only difference between the extremist Al-Qaeda like Muslim and the Salafi Muslims is that the extremist will actually kill you and use violence whilst the Salafi Muslim may just verbally assault your creed and perhaps pronounce takfir.

My question to you the Salafis, Anwar Al Awlaki, ibn Uthaymeen on suicide bombing)?  Isn't the human life sacred no matter their belief?  Isn't being a mercy to humanity more important?

Maybe this is all one big test for the entire Muslim ummah.  Allah knows best.

I don't know how many of you caught this, all of us should consider some form of exercise during the month. Just to summarize a few key points (and adding from some of my own knowledge):

**Motivation:**

* Fasting does not slow down metabolism. You do not experience strength loss in of itself (i.e. muscle catabolism) from fasting intermittently during the month. Any decrease in productivity is purely psychological. [Here's a list of battles muslims fought/trained for during Ramadan](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_battles_fought_during_Ramadan_by_Muslims). If they could march, you should be able to pick up a few weights for an hour in an air conditioned room. No excuses.

* An undisciplined Ramadan regimen will undoubtedly lead to a decrease in strength and gain in fat

* A LOT of people who aren't muslims train fasted a couple of times a week as this boosts your muscle growth afterwards. Here's an [article](http://www.leangains.com/2009/12/fasted-training-boosts-muscle-growth.html) explaining why.

**The Plan:**

* **Workouts:** Don't be taken by the myth that working out while fasting leads to muscle deterioration. Three times a week, but it has some disadvantages given the limited time we have in the nights in summer, especially in non-equatorial regions. [Please see Azeenab's comment below for a more detailed plan](http://www.reddit.com/r/islam/comments/uxtft/post_on_staying_healthy_in_ramadan_on_rfitness/c4zy8ng)

* **Diet:** Post-workout is iftaar. Have a nice meal focused on carbs and protein. Pasta's great and don't be afraid of fatty meats. In general, fried stuff, sodas and don't forget the veggies! Use a calorie logger and don't aim for a large calorie deficit or a massive surplus. Maintain. Suhoor meals should be like iftaar but with more fat since it takes longer to digest. Oatmeal and eggs are great as is Casein protein if you're into supplementation.

* **Water:** At least a gallon (~4 liters) during the nights.

* **Rest:** A primary driver of your motivation and muscle recovery is good sleep. Sleep for a few hours before suhoor if you can and after fajr (before work). Nap during the day (esp. pre-workout) if you get the chance.

First, it is good to see that most of you don't blame the individual. That is, it's good to see there is a distinction between urges and action.

So let me start by telling you a bit about myself. I'm in my 30's and I'm born and raised in the Western Hemisphere. In keeping with my faith I try and pray 5 times a day, and I don't eat pork or drink alcohol. And, since I have never been married, I have never had sex. Man or woman. Not even kissing.

You might ask how, it's a lot like how one can know they are straight before ever having sex. And, to quote Dan Savage (creator of the ""It Gets Better Project""), sexual orientation isn't just about who you want to have sex with - it's about who you want to fall in love with.

I've known I've been gay for quite a while. In fact

Even getting treatment for this depression was tough because my parents don't believe Allah created mental health issues. My parents have consistently chosen to make a dua instead of accepting a mental health diagnosis or the validity of any medication a psychiatrist or psychologist would prescribe. 

Because of this

Instead, went on ummrah, asked a friend to pray about it when they went to Mecca, I've stayed in a state of wudu whenever possible, I've devoted myself considerably to charity work and service, and I've abstained from pornography for quite some time now.

Yet, hold hands, and even kiss. I just want that to be a guy.

I've thought about also just getting married to a girl - if only to fulfill my obligation to honor my parents. But I've decided against it because it would be dishonest to whatever woman would be caught up in this. And

The reason I'm writing all this is because I don't know what to do next. For much of my late 20s, especially of late, the thought of being Forever Alone in this life is starting to take it's toll. I'm getting depressed again like I used to, it's hard to work, and many days (when I can get away with it) I don't even get out of bed.

The reason for this long wall of text (sorry) is because I wanted to ask these questions:

* Praying the gay away and praying the sadness away doesn't seem to be working. I know if I go to a registered psychologist or psychiatrist

* Part of the reason I wanted to kill myself when I was younger is because I thought it better to take my own life while I hadn't committed any grave sins yet instead of living my life with the risk I may commit the sin of a homosexual act. In Islam

* I know some scholars say that one can still be Muslim and do wrong deeds. Islam doesn't excommunicate based on deeds. But much of the literature I read suggests acting on homosexual desires nullifies all the good you've done in this world and guarantees you a spot in hell. Can one be Muslim and be in a committed gay relationship and have even the slightest chance of going to heaven?

* Finally, while a sin, does not count for a grave sin worthy of death or guaranteed hellfire?

I should point out to the moderators that I am not suicidal now nor do I have any plans to kill myself. Thanks for taking the time to read all this.

*edit: I'm going to try and respond to as many comments as I can before I step away from the computer (it's late at night here). I can't thank you enough for the kindness you've shown here. I was genuinely concerned that many comments would be calling me a kufr or something. Insha'Allah

*edit 2: Wow - didn't expect so many responses. Thank you for the level of kindness you all have shown. I also received a few comments and private messages from people asking/suggesting why I don't simply stop believing in Islam. I respect those who are atheists and it's hard for me to explain why I continue to be a Muslim. The best way I can put it is this: the only thing I am more certain about than my sexuality is my faith. I came to this subreddit because I am looking for guidance on how to preserve that faith despite this difficulty. But I take no offense to anyone who suggests I do otherwise. In fact I appreciate that you took the time to write or comment.*

*edit 3: Been spending what seems almost the entire day reading and responding to comments. Thank you again for the kindness you've shown. I know this isn't the kind of topic this subreddit likes to discuss because it often devolves into arguments about why homosexual acts should (or are) permissible in Islam. Please know I respect the fact it is not my place to make what is haram into halal. And I really do appreciate all the advice I've received from the Muslims and non-Muslims in this subreddit. I will keep an eye for new comments but am stepping away from the computer again.*

*edit 4: Thank you for everyone who is still leaving comments and replying. It means a lot. Going through more comments right now. I,,False,self,t5_2qhbp,True,,True

we tried to work through this


i was devastated when he left because i thought this was the man i was going to marry.  we'd shared everything together.  we had grown up together in many ways. 4  yeaqrs was a long time.  i had devoted my life to him and was 100% committed to him, and i did not want to wear the hijab.  and i had only ever worn it because the SO wanted me to.  so i took it off. because i thought, he was gone, he doesn't want to be with me, why should i restrict myself?  i also felt like it was a lie to wear it if my intention was not there


for some reason i thought he would not be mad.  he had left me after all. but when he found out about it, gave me the most awful looks.  it was like i had betrayed them all.  it made me so mad in many ways because, i dont know why so many people wrapped up the whole of being a Muslim in someone wearing a scarf.  they do not know if i pray, they do not know what is in my heart.  why is it so important to everyone?  more than other things?  more than the more important things?

Ah

So... I'm a Muslim!!

I told a friend I'd write about the experience

Anyway, and the Islamophobia seriously bugged me. I knew how big Islam was, and I knew it couldn't be like what the media was saying.

My first real exposure to it was a documentary called *Islam*. It looked at Islam's history, and it was beautiful.

Also

I ended up taking an unexpected hiatus from the internet. By the time I got back to Gaia

However, I've posted here before, before my stream of questions flooded the first page. Here I've gotten a lot of insight... I came back, after leaving Reddit along for months, because I began to consider Islam as a path to follow and I wanted to talk to Muslims about it and learn what I could.

I have two copies of (translations of) the Quran. One is a hard copy that is given out free by the masjid I took shahada at, because I'd been wanting a copy, and I couldn't stand to let him be so disrespectful either.

My other copy is the iQuran, and the option to listen to a recitation.

I am on chapter ten on the digital copy. The more I read

Ah... I need to back up a little. See, so I went elsewhere to find faith. I took to Buddhism, and though I never became a ""card-carrying"" Buddhist, I considered myself a student of the teachings of the Middle Way.

As I read more about Islam, and, more importantly, omnibenevolent. The realization of these things filled my soul with a bright light, and a great joy.

And that's why I've been pestering you guys so much... ♥

While I was at the masjid today, from his perspective, I was already Muslim.

Another brother was there

And so I did.

I don't feel any differently (though I will admit that I can sense my perspective changing as I embrace Islam more), first in Arabic and then in English, I know that I did the right thing.

I now have prayer clothes and a hijab I don't know how to wear... And a nice prayer mat and an instruction booklet. And a new class to attend next Sunday. One for new Muslims.

Number of times a Muslim tried to convert me: ZERO.

most troubling are the ones that suggests something wrong with me. Wait a minute now. do not dare to insult my intelligence. I have a very professional life and high education background.

something came to my mind: Why would Atheists/Christians come and comment on every post here? out of love? doubt it. care about us? maybe but the tone I read from their messages suggests otherwise.

Doesn't this sound too familiar? wanting to convert others.. calling others names and questioning their intelligence because they do not agree with you??.

There will be some sort of backlash towards you. However it should subside quickly and shouldn't be anything like 10 years ago. With that said consider the following points when going about your daily lives in the coming days.


*Don't feed the trolls.

*Don't mind the morons who will come out of the woodworks and attack you.

*Don't pay attention to the neanderthals who will call you names and blame all of 9/11 on you.

[19.17] So she took a veil (to screen herself) from them; then We sent to her Our spirit

[19.18] She said: Surely I fly for refuge from you to the Beneficent God

[19.19] He said: I am only a messenger of your Lord: That I will give you a pure boy.

[19.20] She said: When shall I have a boy and no mortal has yet touched me

[19.21] He said: Even so; your Lord says: It is easy to Me: and that We may make him a sign to men and a mercy from Us

[19.22] So she conceived him; then withdrew herself with him to a remote place.

[19.23] And the throes (of childbirth) compelled her to betake herself to the trunk of a palm tree. She said: Oh

[19.24] Then (the child) called out to her from beneath her: Grieve not

[19.25] And shake towards you the trunk of the palmtree

[19.26] So eat and drink and refresh the eye. Then if you see any mortal

[19.27] And she came to her people with him

[19.28] O sister of Haroun! your father was not a bad man

[19.29] But she pointed to him. They said: How should we speak to one who was a child in the cradle?

[19.30] He said: Surely I am a servant of Allah; He has given me the Book and made me a prophet;

[19.31] And He has made me blessed wherever I may be

[19.32] And dutiful to my mother

[19.33] And peace on me on the day I was born

[19.34] Such is Isa

As we all know, as Allah [](/swt) has said in the Qur'an, He has made it easy for us to read and understand -- whether that's through tafsir (commentary), hadith, classes, etc. The point I'm trying to make is that it is incumbent upon each and every one of us to research and learn about our religion.

Following is a list of resources that have greatly helped me in better understanding Islam and increasing my knowledge, for you:


* [**Online diploma courses for Islamic studies** - WIDE RANGE OF TOPICS
* [Online Qur'an with many translations](http://www.quran.com)
* [Online collection of Hadith books](http://www.sunnah.com)
* [**Online tool for calculating prayer times based on your exact GPS location** - really nice
* [YouTube channel with large number of good educational videos](http://www.youtube.com/user/khalifahklothing)
* [Another (small) YouTube channel](http://www.youtube.com/user/qfanar)
* [Site to download Qur'an audio (torrents available)](http://quranicaudio.com/)
* [Site for ""fatwas""
* [Sheikh Assim al Hakeem's site for question/answer
* [Site to download Qur'an audio (Mishary) with Muhsin Khan's English translation - Br. Sabbir](http://www.sabbir.com)
* More to come as I remember...

Hopefully

EDIT: Some sites mentioned in the comments (I haven't personally checked all of these)

1360692594.0,18e0nb,To believe Adam wasn't born to parents isn't to disbelieve in evolution,Logical1ty,91,44,126,"This is for Muslims regarding different views of evolution among us:

To believe Adam wasn't born to parents isn't to disbelieve in evolution

The creation of Adam and Eve (as) in Heaven was a miraculous intervention by Allah in the natural course of events.

It is like the belief that Jesus (as) was born without a father

Evolution is a natural process which was occurring in this world from its creation and will continue until its end. Miracles are divine interventions in the natural course of events.

The most popular Sunni accounts (whose basis I am not sure of) about the first people (how Adam and Eve began to populate the Earth) also entail miraculous intervention depending on how one views those reports

As for how Adam was created in Heaven

&gt; Abu Hurairah narrated that the Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) said: ""Allah created Adam from dust after He mixed the clay and left him for some time until it became sticky mud
&gt;
&gt; (Sahih Bukhari)

Clay is regarded as an important possible medium for abiogenesis for the beginning of life on Earth (one of several theories).

Note that this process took time and wasn't creation ex nihilo (out of nothing). Being that God isn't very arbitrary it stands to reason for whomever trusts this account that this process was important even if only in a symbolic manner (the implication here is that God repeated the process by which life on Earth likely began). The reason for that is because Adam was meant for this world from the very beginning:

&gt; And when your Lord said to the angels, along with your praises, proclaim Your purity and sanctify Your name?"" He said, ""Certainly, I know what you do not know."" And He taught Adam the names, all of them; then presented them before the angels, and said, if you are right."" They said, ""O Adam, and that I know what you disclose and what you have been concealing. 
&gt;
&gt; (Surah 2

All the classical commentators say this knowledge that Adam was given was related to the Earth (life in our material world).

As for evolution, especially among Sufis, who made 7 ontological distinctions of soul (mineral soul, vegetable soul, animal soul, personal soul, human soul, only with human beings was there a miraculous intervention. Kind of like inducting us into the world with a special ceremony of sorts owing to mankind's special purpose. The rest were described through various versions of evolution depending on the scientist in question (often a mixture of LaMarckism and Darwinism). Famous names include Al-Jahiz and Ibn Khaldun. Al-Biruni even wrote about a kind of natural selection:

http://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/226430?uid=3738832&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=4&amp;sid=21101799689877

Westerners who read their works often read them literally and figured we believed humans were just like everyone else (because that part is covered in the Qur'an so it wasn't put into scientific literature).

&gt; “I have to deplore the systematic manner in which the literature of Europe has contrived to put out of sight our scientific obligations to the Muhammadans. Surely they cannot be much longer hidden. Injustice founded on religious rancor and national conceit cannot be perpetuated forever.” (Draper
&gt;
&gt; “[Christian] theological authorities were therefore constrained to look with disfavor on any attempt to carry back the origin of the earth to an epoch indefinitely remote, we meet the ideas with which we flatter ourselves with having originated our own times. Thus our modern doctrine of evolution and development were taught their [Muslim] schools. In fact they carried them much farther than we are disposed to do, extending them even inorganic and minerals.” (The History of the Conflict between Religion and Science, John William Draper, pp. 118, 187-188.)

This guy was from Darwin's era: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_William_Draper

At first this doesn't seem like a huge deal, not science based on experimental method which is the change that Darwin heralded, often a teleological approach was used where it was like with each species was a step leading to us, the most advanced). Whether one believes the branch of humanity was like any other or specially put there after a ceremony to distinguish it, seems like a non-issue with respect to science and that is correct. It is a non-issue with respect to science because both camps acknowledge the same empirical evidence with the same explanations about natural processes (a theory about our origin is actually unfalsifiable because there's no evidence left of our direct ancestors, so someone can say we were planted here by aliens and who could prove that wrong?). 

But with respect to *religion*

1. Belief in God.
2. Belief in the special role God made for us (as described in the Qur'an).

Denying the entire account of Adam's (as) creation is pretty much a denial of the Qur'an because it's written right there. On the other hand, that's where all this junk (from Christians as well as Muslims and others) about Darwin being Satan or inspired by Satan comes from. Why such craziness? Because if you read the story, Iblis knew from the beginning the specialness of our creation and he turned against God based on pride, spite, and jealousy. It would be the best thing possible from his point of view for us to deny such an event and instead take our place among the rest of the lowly animals of Earth, which is the sort of ""speciesism"" he was engaged in (talking about how his race was superior to those made from Earth: material life, which to this point had been plants and animals). So there is this knee-jerk reaction from some corners of the Islamic theological community where they don't look at the belief itself (regarding Adam's origin) as problematic (where they could merely say ""this is some new interpretation based on Western apologetics among Muslims""), should you believe in him
