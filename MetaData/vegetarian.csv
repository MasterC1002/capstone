Yes

I was at work today, I bit down on something tough.  Assuming it was just a tough piece from the spinach plant, I pulled it out of my mouth to set it aside.

Wait a second - is that a CLAW?  Yes, I observed that what I'd just pulled out of my mouth was a bird foot, with 2 claws still intact.  A bird foot.  I immediately felt sick to my stomach, and began to wonder how this could happen.  I don't even want to think about where the rest of this bird ended up.

After taking many pictures and becoming quite the spectacle among my colleagues

I am putting this out there so that people who purchase these products are made aware of this company's apparent lack of quality control.  I think it's also important to share this with people who are serious vegetarians as this almost certainly represents a significant issue for them.  In any case

Here are the photos that I captured immediately after this awful discovery.  I'll update with the company's response if/when I receive one.  

Right after I spit the thing out:

""Hi Joshua. Thank you for bringing this to our attention. Usually we are more prompt with our responses--our apologies. We have received your email and we'll contact you tomorrow morning. Thank you.""  Not surprisingly

UPDATE 3:  We're nearing 11:00a PST 31JAN13

UPDATE 4:  11:40a PST 31JAN13.  Amy's finally contacted me.  A nice woman called and apologized for the situation, etc) but declined to send them the items at this time.  They said they would contact me with what they find out. 

UPDATE 5: 11:45a PST 1FEB13. Amy's responded to me in email. Apologized

UPDATE 6: 1:35p PST 1FEB13.  I'm not sure when it happened, if you know the URL, the page will still work ([url]http://www.amys.com/about-us/our-kitchen[/url]).  Because I think ahead, I already have screen captures of all the original website content.  And the more of this shady behavior I see, the more angry I get. 

UPDATE 7: 4:30p PST 1FEB13.  I just noticed that employees of Amy's have been snooping on my LinkedIn profile.  Interesting.

My mother assures me that if we should decide to start eating meat, and don't want to kill when it's unnecessary. The way i see it, we no longer need meat to survive.

Jump ahead to six months later, two weeks), I would have thought that impossible, but since I've actually committed to it, I'm amazed at how easy it is. Since it's only been a week, I still have naughty things in my fridge: sugary juice, rye bread, I just remind myself that it's not worth the empty calories. And like that

Anyway, it was hard, because eating unhealthfully would really affect no one but myself. Saying no to meat was easy because I was doing it for the animals. Turns out that's been good practice for saying no to other things.


TL;DR: Being a vegetarian has strengthened my overall willpower. 


**Edit:** A lot of people seem to be concerned that I'm not getting enough carbs, rice, pasta, etc). I still eat things like rolled oats and whole grain cereals, as well as quinoa and legumes. I did not specify, because the point of this post was my new found willpower, not my diet specifically. However, and I truly appreciate the concern! :D

1365622134.0,1c2zp3,A little guide for non-vegetarian ingredients. You're probably consuming animal products you don't know about.,Brodivh,139,26,103,"I thought I'd compile a list of all the information I've gathered over the years of being a vegetarian for those who haven't done as much research into what goes into their presumably vegetarian friendly foods. I went ahead and found wikipedia links for everything I listed too. I'd encourage everyone to do their own research into these and other ingredients

Most people know about [gelatin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gelatin#Production ), but what about:

[Mono- and diglycerides](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diglycerides#Food_additive )- A lot of the time this substance can be made with a plant-based source like soy or corn so it's important to look into this on a company to company basis. Found in a lot of foods like baked goods (bread) and ice cream.

[Vitamin D](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholecalciferol#Industrial_production ) Specificly D3- Often made from lanolin

[DATEM](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DATEM )- You know it's questionable when the word is all capitol letters. DATEM is one of those things that could very well be vegetarian (soy)

[L-cysteine](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cysteine#Industrial_sources )- Very often found in bread, it's basically processed duck feathers (although it's actually been made from human hair too). Oddly enough, it's apparently good for hangovers.

[Magnesium Stearate](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnesium_stearate )- This is going to be one of the big ones for a lot of people. Chances are everyone reading this has some Magnesium Stearate laying around and they don't even know it. Do you take medicine? Then you're probably ingesting this product. It's in most tablets. Yum. Also, such as Staeric acid and [Sodium Stearoyl Lactylate](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium_stearoyl_lactylate#Food_applications_and_maximum_use_levels ), which is itself found in a lot of stuff such as pudding and baked goods.

[Lipase](http://curd-nerd.com/lipase-what-is/)- is an enzyme used in cheese making. It's present in milk naturally

[Castoreum](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Castoreum#Food_use)- You'll have to wonder how this one even started. Castoreum is a chemical used by Beavers to mark their territories. It's used as a food additive and one of those mysterious ""Natural Flavors"". It's use is not huge

[Cochineal](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cochineal#Uses)- Food coloring made from bugs. It's used as a dye for a LOT of different things and is fairly common.

[Shellac](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shellac)- is a bug secretion used to not only make your furniture shiney

Natural and Artificial Flavors. For vegetarians, Doritos and Cheetos use either pork or chicken flavoring. Personally, I just use common sense when deciding what to eat with natural flavorings in it. For instance, if it's a chocolate bar, you're probably okay.

Many beers and wines contain animal products

Not specific to what's in the food, so it was only natural that while I was in college I started cooking in restaurants. Eventually I was doing it full time and managing a restaurant. I spent years in commercial kitchens. I can tell you that if you're the least bit picky about your food and how it's prepared, either stick to vegetarian restaurants or cook for yourself (which I think most people should be doing more of anyway). The truth is if there is meat being prepared in the kitchen, your food probably isn't as vegetarian as you'd like. Grills, fryers, and other cooking areas are used for everyone's food. Your fries are probably being dropped in the fryer with chicken, your veggie quesadilla is covered in meat grease from the flat-top, but that's the truth of eating at a lot of restaurants. I know some people don't necessarily care too much about this

I didn't plan this out before I started typing it up

I see people wondering about rennet a lot. Sargento cheeses are usually safe. The few that aren't are listed on their [FAQ page](http://www.sargento.com/our-company/faq/ ). A summary on rennet for those who don't know- Rennet or Rennin is an enzyme used to coagulate milk to form cheese. While the name can occasionally be applied to a non-animal sourced enzyme, especially hard cheeses. The unfortunate situation is that almost all manufacturers list the vague ingredient of ""enzymes"" on their packaging. Some cheeses specify that they are vegetarian friendly, and there are certain varieties of soft cheeses that also tend to be less likely to use rennet such as cottage cheese or Mascarpone.

[The Buffalo Cauliflower Wings from PETA's website](http://www.peta.org/living/vegetarian-living/spicy-buffalo-cauliflower-wings.aspx)

I did things a little bit differently after reading the reviews

Instead of baking them for 18 minutes before adding the sauce, until golden brown. One of the reviews said they weren't crispy from just baking them.

When I was mixing my buffalo sauce, since I'm a weakling when it comes to spice, (thanks acid reflux!)

I did about 1/4 cup (at most) of Franks Red Hot, since I had less sauce.

Poured that over the deep fried cauliflower

I highly recommend this recipe, and easy.

When I was mixing the flour and water together

Also, and sprayed it with non-stick spray. (I'm very glad I did that, because a couple of them still tried to stick!)

I came to my current diet because I was increasingly disinterested in meat and wanted to eat healthier, I was overwhelmed by the sheer amount of exclusion that occurs between vegetarians, especially in all the different labels. You eat a fish once? Banished to pescetarianism. Like dairy and eggs on occasion? Octo-Lavo. This culture of ultra-specific labeling, from at least my experience, creates a sort of pressure to adhere to a strict moral code for your diet. People will tell you you're not X because of Y. Your diet is judged, even if they're not trying to be negative or insulting. Combine this with the fact that all of a sudden, you're exposed to a multitude of moral conflicts even within your vegetarian sub-group. Dealing with issues like rennet in cheese or fish bladder in beer, both on a personal and social level.


After all of this, ethical, and social questions.


This isn't necessarily bad, is how alienating all of this is to someone who is just starting to explore vegetarianism. If you're not prepared for this kind of consciousness, or are dismayed by the politics involved, you're much more likely to give up. And then rather than having someone who maybe could have been eating vegetarian 75% of the time, they're back to regularly eating meat and meat-by-products (not to mention the influence spite can have after being disillusioned; enough people hate vegetarians as it is). So you're left with an insular community whose very exclusive nature is causing potential vegetarians to be turned away, which only takes away from the goal of trying to get more people to have healthier vegetarian eating habits!

**Note** *You're honestly taking a risk with your food coming in contact with meat products at Taco Bell. They generally put the tortilla onto a wrapper and slide it down, using an allergy excuse should work to let the employees know to change their gloves and take extra precautions.*

**We have found out that the refried beans are vegetarian

A lot of the meat can be substituted with potato chunks which are quite tasty. Sometimes beans can also replace it

Also

**Current ♥ Special**

*Beefy Crunch Burrito* (nacho cheese, ~~sour cream~~, ~~beef~~ ⇒ potatoes)
I highly recommend this. It's my favourite.

**Naturally Vegetarian Menu Items**

*Potato Taco* (potato chunks, cheese)

*Cheesy Nachos* [These are wonderful to just add rice, tomatoes, jalapeños]

*7-Layer Burrito* (rice, lettuce, tomatoes, ~~sour cream~~, guacamole)

*Bean Burrito* (beans, red sauce)

*Cheesey Roll-Up* (3-cheese)

*Cheese Quesadilla* (3-cheese

*Cinnamon Twists*

*Caramel Apple Empanadas*

*Pinto Beans and Cheese* (pinto beans

*Rice*

*Cheesy Fiesta Potatoes* (potato chunks

*Tostada* (flat hard shell with beans, cheddar cheese)

**Modifiable Options**

I've seen regular *tacos* be made with *beans* instead of meat. It didn't really look appetising to me

I'd recommend taking any *burrito* you think looks good and trying it using potatoes. However

*Salads* are obvious choices you can get without meat instead

You have *chalupas*

*Crunchwrap Supremes* are delicious without meat in general

**Pro-tip**: Baja Blast Mountain Dew is just Mountain Dew with blue Powerade. :) I hate having to tell people that we don't have it at our location.


*  The full menu is also at [Taco Bell's website](http://www.tacobell.com/).

I'm a student from across the pond (Denmark) and every night at 10:25 PM I go out on my bike with lots of bags and take food that the supermarkets throw out. This way I get free (often organic) food. Usually it has exceeded the expiration date but sometimes it gets thrown out because one fruit has a dent or there is a hole in the bag. I've been doing it for two months and I've never had better food in my life. Things I get on an almost daily basis: Organic rye bread, all kinds of vegetables (avocado, leek,tomatoes, red bell peppers, broccoli, carrots - everything you would ever want). In addition I sometimes get socks, beers, chickpeas

In Denmark, and since I almost never buy anything, my waste-contribution is almost nonexistent. In addition I almost live for free. 
Yesterday I had a couchsurfer in my house (I live for rent with 2 guys and my girlfriend) and he went with me on my garbage treasure hunt - he was amazed and wants to do the same when he returns to New York. In one of the containers

I called some friends and gave them some, mushrooms and bacon. I gladly ate the bacon even though I never eat meat, because from my point of view it would be a terrible waste for the pig to have suffered and died for less reason (if that reason is to feed us, which I don't exactly believe). All the energy that has been put into raising the pig, feeding it and transporting and packaging it would have been completely wasted. And as you might realise, I hate waste.

My couchsurfer is a vegan and did not have any - which I obviously have no problem with.
But how about you? What kind of vegetarian are you and what is your view on this?

I'm a 28 year old male from Canada originally and I've been a vegetarian for more than a decade. In that time

My girlfriend is a Korean vegetarian/near-vegan and we cook together. Sometimes we use Facebook to connect with other vegans/vegetarians in our city (Seoul). Usually the group that comes out is a mix of Canadians, and some Europeans. 

Anyway, other people's political views, tastes in music... everything. They all have the same style, same beliefs and similar personalities. A lot of them seem dainty and stuck up to me (not to be harsh). Also, my personality is very eclectic in that I like a wide variety of things that very occasionally conflict in some superficially silly way.  

Because of this, and keeps acting surprised every time it comes up (and I've been a vegetarian for a lot longer than most of them). He actually said: ""I heard you became a vegetarian! Good for you!"" To which I replied: ""...and I've been one for more than a decade."" 

Overall, and they politely told a couple to quit the group because they ate fish. They've also decided to disallow meat eaters joining in the meeting, which meant I was messaged and told not to come after I clicked ""attend"" on Facebook (because the leader is the guy who keeps forgetting I'm a vegetarian). 

So yeah

I'm a vegetarian because I like animals a lot and I think factory farms are sick

Apparently they thought the whole time that these would have meat in them and just the absence of it made them not want any part of these.  One guy even tried a bite and acted like he was about to throw up and threw it in the trash.  Another guy even called me ""unamerican"" because I don't smoke cigarettes like the rest of them and was eating a vegetarian meal.

I had social studies class right before lunch. Our teacher was the kind who loved to disgust us: he frequently told us how many insect pieces or rat hairs could be found in snack foods, and tobacco products.

That September, headcheese, and the general meat processing industry. We got out of class and went to lunch, where, by chance, hot dogs were on the menu. I was so grossed out that I (admittedly) overreacted and told everyone that I was going vegetarian immediately.

Today, and I haven't eaten meat since. I've officially been a vegetarian for over half of my life.

For those thinking about going vegetarian: try it. It's a good lifestyle choice with (as you can see) a great community.
For those who say ""I could *never* be a vegetarian:"" you can. Take things one step at a time. All you need is a little willpower.

1 1/2 cups dried lentils (I used brown)

2 cups water

1/2 cup unsweetened coconut flakes

1 tbsp garam masala (sweeter) and/or madras curry powder (spicier) (i used some of both)

1 tsp cayenne 

salt to taste

In a large pot, and simmer for 45 minutes (until lentils are very tender; if you use red or black lentils this will be 20-30 minutes).  If you have a hand blender (highly recommend), blend until smooth.  If using regular blender, blend in a few batches and transfer to another bowl/pot.  This made 4-5 quarts of soup, so plenty of leftovers.

The main reason why I became a vegetarian is because of the US's factory farming. I initially started as a veg that would still consider (in extreme dire situations) eating meat if it was properly raised. After more research, properly raised or not. This was until my thoughts on traveling came about. I still don't believe I would eat any meat, but it would be hard to avoid fish stock or something like that.

I'm still such a Reddit newb

Unfortunately, but at the same time... well, I'm kind proud of myself, I guess? Took me a few years to go properly veg in the first place, and it's always been a really important step for me - I'm a crazy animal lover, and really want to make a difference in protecting the planet and my own health, too! So

It's definitely meant a whole new way of shopping and eating and going out... takes a little more effort, I still manage to try as many 'local delicacies' and such when travelling as I ever did before, if not more - veggie haggis ain't bad! ;) I've even taken to getting creative in the kitchen at home, trying new cuisines from all over the world. I think the 'restriction' has, perhaps, broadened my culinary horizons far more than it's hindered them. :)

Anyway, I've fallen in love with Indian, Japanese, Thai, Morrocan, and east African cuisines. I've discovered new squashes and beans and greens and fruit I'd never tried before. I've fallen in love with coconut &amp; almond milks. I recently made my very first Tofurkey roast and impressed the heck out of myself (add red wine to the baste)!

They are cheap, lasts my family a year (oc, we always buy three varieties of unflavored: ground, chunk, and strips).

Here is the key: when you rehydrate

For instance, soy sauce, vegetable oil, and liquid smoke to get porky chunks for sweet and sour pork. This is the fattiest meat, so I add more oil to porkish TVP.

I rehydrate with water, and poultry seasonings for a poultry-like flavor, good for stir fries. Far less oil for poultry-like.

For beef, soy sauce, browning sauce, oil, and paprika, and I get a good beefish TVP that makes excellent sizzling beef (more oil) or a ground beef replacement (less oil) using the crumble.

Just thought I'd share since you guys and gals are all so awesome. I do feel giving the TVP some fat in rehydration is essential. Fat tastes good

I mean, okay, even serving me mayo and cheese on my sandwich wrap after I asked you *twice* not to is one thing.  But the corporate offices of restaurant chains should have the nutritional information of their food ready and posted on the Internet and/or in their restaurants.

My thoughts:  The problem with this is that it assumes that, I guess I can't speak for everyone, but my egg and dairy consumption did not measurably increase when I became vegetarian.  My soy, grain, and bean consumption did, and I still ate dairy and eggs, but no more than anyone else around me.  So even if the author's math is right--and I'm not saying anything on that one way or the other--I'm thinking one would have to be a pretty **a**typical vegetarian for his or her diet to kill more animals than an omnivorous one.

Box of Vital Wheat Gluten (VWG) - Wegmans and Coop
Garbanzo bean flour (chic pea flour) - coop only
Braggs Amino Acids - coop (it's like a soy sauce substitute but better than soy sauce)
Veg bullion cubes (about 4) -Wegmans coop
Veg stock - Wegmans coop
A-1 or other steak flavor (I use franks hot sauce!!)
OPTIONAL:
Liquid smoke - Wegmans (small bottle)
Any seasoning like Hamburger rub or bacon salt

Directions 
Mix the full box of VWG with 1/4 cup chic pea flour. Mix well with dry hands. (Add seasoning if you want)

Separate bowl mix: 1 1/4 cup veg stock; 1/2 cup braggs amino acids

Boil 8 cups water in the largest pot you have

Mix the flours and the liquid together and kneed with your hands. It gets REAL doughy quick so work fast. Don't add all the liquid at first. Add more if its dry. I usually have less tha 1/4 cup left. KNEED FOR FIVE MINUTES. one big ball.

Sit the big ball into four parts. The try to flatten each quarter. I stretch, use a rolling pin to do this. Once you have all four as flat as possible, let sit for five minutes. 

Come back, reduce to a slow simmer. Come back in 1/2 hour to stir. Walk away. Come back in 45, stir and then drain into strainer. Let sit for five minutes to drain. 

Pre-heat oven to 325-350. Spray pan with non stick spray. Lay out all the seitan pieces. BAKE! For about 15 min, or until they are just starting to brown. Take them out. 

There yeah go! From here the possibilities are endless. BBQ sandwich, or alone as a snack.

So I've been a vegetarian for about 3 months now

Although I'm a little confused by some of the posts here. There is a lot of negative comments regarding vegetarianism from users advocating a vegan lifestyle -- you know,000+ delicious meals without them with the help of this book!

That isn't to say that vegetarians don't do the same damn thing. After all

I just want to ask: why? I figure the vegan who eats one free range chicken a month (never seen this

The way I see it, and talk about healthy nutrition. But the community has always been so dichotomous: you are either a vegetarian or you aren't. You are either a vegan or you are an insensitive, animal abusing prick. YES there is a definition for vegetarian just there is a definition for being ""gay"" but we all accepted that there can be variations on that theme. Its kind of like if we had a ""greener living"" reddit, and the bicycle riders scoffed at the hybrid car owners, and the dudes with windmills on their roof cannot possibly comprehend a lifestyle that doesn't involve windmills on their roof.

So what the hell am I talking about? I guess I'm looking to discuss with some fine subreddit members their take on definitions, and where people like to draw the line between ""doing their part for the animals"" and ""obviously putting very little effort in"". Or perhaps you don't think its about effort? Just give me your thoughts people!

And I apologize if this is an incredibly ranty post. I'm not honestly pissed off or anything. I think being a vegetarian/vegan/one-chicken-a-monthan is a difficult lifestyle, but I think it does deter some people from considering it. To feel accepted its often ""all or nothing"".

* Are there any supplements I should consider taking?

I have noticed that some of you on here have been struggling with eating healthy while adhering to a vegetarian or vegan diet.

I have been working on this project with a small company. They normally focus on professional software to optimize diets. We have now ventured out into the app market

Instead of focusing on single nutrients or calories this app zooms in on the (10) food groups and uses an individualized approach. The recommendations are based on a personal profile
You log your intake for a week and get your ""healthy eating index"". From there you can start working on eating healthier in the following weeks.

The app comes loaded with additional information about the food groups

It is still a work in progress but the basic functions alone provide you with a competent program to start working on your diet.

You can get a little more information here http://www.goe-software.de/WordPress/?page_id=1511

and a quick tutorial here http://www.goe-software.de/WordPress/?page_id=1497

Please feel free to ask me any questions and I will answer to the best of my abilities!

One of my favourite YouTube chefs recently posted a video with a recipe for a pasta dish. Throughout the video, and seemed quite proud of herself (as almost all of her other savoury dishes seem to include meat). She even made a point to use vegetable stock instead of chicken stock, in order to ""keep it vegetarian"".

Yet towards the end of the video, which she was using, is most definitely not suitable for vegetarians. It's made using animal rennet, which you have to kill the calf in order to obtain. And obviously, vegetarians aren't supposed to eat anything that has come from an animal that's had to be killed to obtain the food. It's not at all uncommon for a vegetarian to not realise this, so you're welcome (and I apologise) if you only just found this out. 

But it makes me worried. I know that food products sold in supermarkets (at least here in the UK) have to be approved by the Vegetarian Society before you can claim that they're suitable for vegetarians. But in restaurants

Anyway, and that I was definitely going to try it without the parmesan, but that I just thought she should know her mistake. 

I was absolutely accosted by angry, it's only vegans who can't eat cheese"". It just makes me so sad, that even in this day and age, vegetarians are treated with such intolerance and dare I say it, hate.

 My own grandmother phoned me the other night and the topic somehow turned to my not eating meat, sighed and said 'not another one' (referring to my Dad, a lacto vegetarian attempting to become vegan, whom my grandparents dislike mainly because of his diet choice). 

It all just makes me lose faith in humanity. I'm not one of those vegetarians who accuses meat-eaters of being murderers and treats everyone else as inferior to me due to their eating habits. I really have no problem with other people eating meat, even around me. But it's just times like these when I wish everyone would just wake up.

My gripe is that there are now so many posts on who is and who isn't a *real* vegetarian. Or when you can and cannot call yourself a vegan. 

I mean, demonize anyone that 'doesn't fit' the definition. We're here because, for one reason or another, we enjoy it.

I know that, but self-righteousness as a response is not very becoming.

If someone wants to call hirself vegetarian

Vegetarian, omnivore...it's all the same. We're all just here to enjoy talking about vegetarian goodness.

So c'mon folks

EDIT: I'm no longer commenting here. I'll come back and peruse the sub for some nice recipes. But the culture is spiteful and unforgiving. The mere mention of someone not using a word correctly was grounds for insults and demonizing. I just hope that folks will be enough at peace with their own meal decisions (and otherwise) so as to not have a chip on their shoulder and lash out everytime someone gets it wrong (even if it's accidental). Calling people 'laughably pathetic' was a surprise to me after seeing that being a vegetarian usually comes with a peaceful sense of being. I know it's tough to deal with the insults you may come across for choosing a specific diet

Not that I was a big meat eater anyway but I starting making the effort to eat a mostly vegetarian for about 6 months and then I went full veg for about 4 more before I became pregnant.

So now I'm a lot better with the nausea (thanks to medication) and I'm trying to eat mostly vegetarian - I feel a bit guilty but I plan on going back to veg after the baby is born (not sure if before/after breastfeeding).
