Today, Mozilla, Wikimedia, and the FSF for [American Censorship Day](http://americancensorship.org/).

Part of this act would undermine the [safe harbor](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safe_harbor) provisions of the [Digital Millenium Copyright Act](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Millennium_Copyright_Act) which would make sites like reddit and YouTube liable for hosting user content that may be infringing. This act would also force search engines, in effect, walling off users from them.

This bill sets a chilling precedent that endangers everyone's right to freely express themselves and the future of the Internet. If you would like to voice your opinion to those in Washington

As you may have noticed

For those curious

This morning around 8am PST

With no clues on what was causing the issue, one of our memcached instances spontaneously rebooted. Perplexed, we attempted to fail around the instance and move forward. Shortly thereafter, a second memcached instance spontaneously became unreachable.

Last night, but unfortunately at the time we had no way to quickly confirm this.

With that in mind

Memcached stores its entire dataset in memory, our caches were completely empty. This meant that every single query on the site had to be retrieved from our slower permanent data stores, namely Postgres and Cassandra.

Since the entire site now relied on our slower data stores, in very small increments. Around 4pm, we finally had all of the pieces turned on. Some things are still moving rather slowly, but it is all there.

We still have a lot of investigation to do on this incident. Several unknown factors remain

In the end, we still have a long way to go. We're very sorry for the downtime, and we are working hard to ensure that it doesn't happen again.

cheers

    FAQ:
    Q1. Is reddit entering the URL shortening business?
    A1. No. We just acquired a cool domain and wanted to show it off.

Note for adblockers: If you made an exception for reddit the simple way (by clicking the stop sign and saying ""Disable on reddit.com""), you should instead set things up as described in [/help/adblock](/help/adblock).

We'll end with a protip that

If you're on an external site, if you're visiting a hot new search engine at `http://www.google.com`, just change that to `redd.it/http://www.google.com` (I know it looks funny, but go with it), and you'll be taken to the reddit page for that URL.

As for the monitoring, and then it failed to reboot cleanly.

We want to tell you why reddit was down.

In short, at around 1:15am PDT.  This may sound familiar, because it was the same type of failure that took us down a month ago. This time however the failure was more widespread and affected a much larger portion of our servers (and not just ours, many other companies were affected as well).  Namely, most of our database slaves were disabled from this outage. Even though we are spread across multiple availability zones (data centers), it did us no good in this case, since the outage was so widespread and hit multiple availability zones.

Since that last failure

We will continue to use Amazon's other services as we have been.  They have some work to do on the EBS product

That being said, and we'll get back to you in a few days.
