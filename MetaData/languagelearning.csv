Here’s a [link to the final report](http://static.duolingo.com/s3/DuolingoReport_Final.pdf).

Some interesting points:

1. On average

2. The study was done by an external research team that previously evaluated the effectiveness of other methods such as Rosetta Stone. It is of note that it took 55 hours of study with Rosetta Stone to reach the equivalent of one semester of college. So not only is Duolingo free-er than Rosetta Stone

We plan on using this data and continually conducting studies to make learning a language with Duolingo even better.

They claim that every day there is a piece of news read by a teacher which you can work with. In the last 3 months it is still the same piece of text and it is read by a machine.

The machine reader is very poor and useless. If you use it it will destroy your chance to pronounce anything properly.

Even in their 1st lesson (as well as lessons 2 and 3) there are missing material. There are screens with just “Text 1″ instead of the actual text.

You cannot repeat any lesson

Grammar explanation is very poor and limited. The explanation of a past time is just couple of lines and 4 examples. The examples are basically the same and there is no mentioning of irregular verbs whatsoever.

If you do not own a Kindle

These are early editions of the books, please let me know about it and i'll get right on it.

Thanks for your time and i hope you enjoy the books.

EDIT:Fixed horrible link formatting.",self,t5_2rjsc,1362517084.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/languagelearning/comments/19pcms/huge_kindle_book_giveaway_french_russian_german/
1356710533.0,15krc0,"My short(ish) but detailed reviews of all the free services (that I have tried). FYI, slight bias towards Spanish, which I am learning.",bluepisces,101,23, then let me try it for myself. I seem to be apt at picking up new words quickly and retaining them easily

*UPDATED - DEC 30 - Added another excellent Spanish resource*

**FYI the number ratings below are based on my opinion/value to me mostly

Alright

**Memrise**

Vocabulary builder at best, you will be no better than a dumb foreigner who knows how to say select words, and no one will likely be able to help you if you go to another country. (Now that I have tried Anki, I prefer it, with the exception of the lack of audio in most of the available community shared decks)

Pros - vocab building, directions, body parts) or get specific stuff.

Cons - very limited and one dimensional. Anki is better if you want to go the spaced repetition/memory building route.

* Reading 3
* Writing 3
* Listening Comprehension 4 (at least native speakers are on there)
* Ability to speak 4
* Overall usefulness 4 (unless you just want to know words, it got me started)

**Duolingo**

Pretty good for teaching you to read a language, but alot of sentences don't translate literally, or even semi-literally. Or just because of the ordering of words Spanish uses (and that their grammar tends to, from the English perspective, create alot of redundancy that is difficult to back out when translating (ie all the se lo and te verb a ellos stuff). One ironic pro/con is the computer voice - it is at least consistent which helps me alot, but because it's not a real voice, I mishear alot of words or they blend together (ie when there's an a followed by a verb or noun beginning with a vowel, even though it's fake

But I will say if you want to mostly be able to read

Pros - teaches you to read

Cons - gets harder the further you go

* Reading 10
* Writing 5
* Listening Comprehension 6.5 (it's a decent start)
* Ability to speak 5
* Overall usefulness 7-10 (depending on your intend ie only reading ability or reading/writing/speaking)

**SpanishDict.com**

Video lessons with some listening/writing/multiple choice test practice. I started using this site after getting about 1/3 through the duolingo course and it does a great job of explaining alot of quirks of the language and how in Spanish they don't say ""it is raining"" they say ""it is doing/making rain"", for a slightly different perspective and filling in the gaps left by each other.

Pros - the tutor speaks very clearly and explains things in a very nice

Cons - I feel a bit tired and bored sometimes after watching the longer videos

* Reading 7
* Writing 5
* Listening Comprehension 9
* Ability to speak 9
* Overall usefulness 8 (if you want to learn Spanish I definitely recommend this

**LiveMocha**

Found this one just over the christmas break.

What I find annoying/disappointing about this one is I find all the exercises fairly tedious, grammar, pronunciation). That is definitely where LiveMocha shines. I have been making a concerted effort at paying careful attention to pronunciations (hence I've noticed the difference between south american and european Spanish) and I try to pronounce things correctly as much as possible. Some people are very nice, while others will be very strict and harsh and chew you out for getting the gender wrong on one thing.

Pros - supports several languages

Cons - review exercises (to me) can be very tedious.

* Reading 5
* Writing 7
* Listening Comprehension 8
* Ability to speak 8
* Overall usefulness 8

**Anki**

This has replaced Memrise for me, and, nor, but, or, yet, so, but I like it because I abandoned Memrise due to much of the content of its courses being largely redundant/too basic for my purposes

I still need to explore this one more but I'm enjoying it right now.

* Reading 5
* Writing 4 (or less if you don't input your own stuff)
* Listening Comprehension N/A (haven't had a deck with sound yet so unless you're saying the words out loud as they come up...)
* Ability to speak 2-3 (again depends on verbal practice)
* Overall usefulness 6 (good self studiers will get alot more from it)

**Babbel** (not free

I used this one briefly a couple of days ago. You do get to try it for free, this would add to that.

Pros (from limited experience) - seems to offer lessons in a unique way to complement your learnings from other sources. Tests you on if you know how to complete a sentence in proper context which is the one thing I feel I've been missing. Also supports several languages.

Cons - does not offer english translations for everything so you can know if you were right or if something meant what you thought.

* Reading 6 (loses points for not giving translations after you've answered)
* Writing 5 (fill in the blanks isn't really great writing practice
* Listening Comprehension 5 (I forget how much audio there was
* Ability to speak 5
* Overall usefulness 7

I give it a 7 because I feel it has alot of potential for me,2411398,00.asp). I know with the plethora of free services, why would I pay for one? Well like I said, every service has it's niche and Babbel does fill one, cheaply. I could get alot out of it in just a month. I just went back to check and I see that the free trial consists of only ONE lesson (of your choice), so you get a very small taste of it

**SpanishPod101.com**

Also not free

* they have lessons based on levels
* they have realistic example interactions/conversations
* each episode has a conversation, and give some extra context, they also have specific vocab for each lesson and break that down too
* transcripts in both languages
* they have a vocab and grammar section at the end plus a final review
* practice exercises
* episodes are tpyically 10-15 mins each.

**My Recommendation:**

* Start with Duolingo if you want to learn one of the languages it supports (now up to 5 - Spanish, Portuguese, Italian, more on the way)
* If learning Spanish
* If learning another language, put in the effort even if it takes longer.
* Anki for vocabulary building and custom practice of whatever you think you need more help to remember (the fact that it's custom puts it SO far above memrise in my mind

**Final Recommendations:**

* Best for Reading **Duolingo**
* Best for Writing **LiveMocha**
* They are kind of tied for the last 2 categories.
* SpanishDict + spanishpod101 for listening comprehension and speaking (if you're learning Spanish)

Final Tips:
* Immersion is DEFINITELY key. Read

We're very lucky to live in a time where so many free resources are available and if we know our learning style we can quickly excel.",self,t5_2rjsc,1356895207.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/languagelearning/comments/15krc0/my_shortish_but_detailed_reviews_of_all_the_free/
1342138741.0,wh01f,Foreign language subreddits [list inside],vaporism,104,11,24,"Inspired by the ""websites similar to reddit in [X language]"" threads

 * I've only added subreddits where a reasonable proportion of submissions is in fact in the language in question. Subreddits for larger

 * I've also only included languages for which I was able to find more than one subreddit.
 
If you know of something that, let me know!

They really don't teach you much.  They teach you random words and sentences that aren't helpful.  If you want to learn how to say ""The ball is blue"" then Rosetta stone if for you.  It isn't even worth using for free imo.  Their voice recognition software is terrible.  This is one thing they love to market and well it is not true.  It will only recognize a hard American accent of the language you are learning.  Native speakers of the language have trouble getting their words recognized with perfect accents.


Now I know you will say ""Then what is better Jhoiz""?
Well, they don't.  The best thing you can do is ask yourself how much time you are willing to put forward and what your goal is.  


If I haven't convinced you here is a good article of someone who has more experience than me at learning languages. [Check it out here](http://www.fluentin3months.com/rosetta-stone-review/) 

Edit: For all those who are flaming.  Please explain why you think RS is good.  It is not like I came here going after the RS company.  I am just trying to give people information so they can make a good decision.  The only people that will tell you RS is good are RS employees or people who have never learned a language to full fluency.

1359056109.0,177g03,"Every language has their quirks, idiosyncrasies and idioms that are fun to discover, learn and use. What are some of your favorites? With Brazilian Portuguese as my second language, I'd like to share the quirkier side of it as I worked my may towards fluency. ",thewhitedeath,14

I'll begin with one of the most indispensable words in the English language: 'Yes'.

Brazilians have decided that this word (Sim) is pretty much 'dead weight' and have thrown it to the curb. Though obviously still part of the language

Example 1: Did you buy the car? (Você comprou o carro?)
Answer: Comprei. (not yes)

Example 2: Did you clean your room? (Você arrumou seu quarto?)
Answer: Arrumei.

BP is a very pro-drop language. If they don't need to say it

Very

Example: ""Did you drop this hundred dollar bill on the ground sir?""
Answer: ""Isso"".

You can go weeks without ever saying 'Yes' in BP.

Now if Brazilians don't like using 'Yes'

 Não não é não! (No it isn't). The dreaded triple negative in English. Perfectly fine in BP.

Borrowed words from English. There are hundreds of borrowed words lifted from English used by Brazilians. Internet. Hot Dog. Laptop. Sandwich. Ketchup. The list goes on. The fun thing about this is that they love to stick an 'E' on the end of every one of them. Makes for some fun words to say:

Laptop - Lapee Topee. 

Hot Dog - Hotchee Dogee

Ketchup - Ketchupee

Sandwich - Sandweeshee.

And just for the sheer absurd fun of it...

King Kong - Kingee Kongee.

Really interesting and fun.

I live in the states and speak native English and conversant Spanish. I have a very close friend who is a French native living here with me. About 6 months ago, what I did that day, where I'm going, what I said, etc.. (with many mistakes and unknown words, of course)

When I see my French friend, and grammatical structures which I use in the following days' journals. We then talk about everything I wrote about in French. It makes my new vocabulary and usage very easy to remember because it's all associated with parts of my live, and all the things I learn are thngs I'm actually trying to say/use. It's been about 6 months and I just returned from a 2 week trip in France where I did reasonably well holding conversations for 10-15 minutes at a time without switching back to English.

1368000485.0,1dx60q,Here is how I have lived in France for four years and managed to not learn French.,devilsadvocado,67,5,100,"I'm a 29-year-old American mec who chased a girl here in February 2009. The plan was to stay for four months. It's been more than four years. 

When I first arrived, colleagues, mates (a pretty international group of friends) and family (my wife comes from an international family). Even when I tried to speak French with people in the shops or other strangers that I randomly met, 95% of the time they would respond to me in English even though I approached them in French. *Le sigh.*

So here I am in France

After having lived in the country for about a year, you've been living in France for one year and you're not fluent? Aren't you ashamed of yourself? How is it possible? Is something wrong with you?"" (I even had pricks berating me for not being fluent after having only lived here six months.) These assholes discouraged me (and continue to discourage me) even more, and I became more settled than ever to just stay in my little English bubble and wait for my wife to finish school so that we could move back to America.

So here I am after four years and I basically speak at a lower intermediate level. I have a crazy teaching schedule coupled with a crazy family schedule (new baby) and it would be hard to make time to practice French even if I wanted to. I'm encouraged by the fact that I've met other people in my situation (long-time foreign residents who haven't picked up the language) and even read in Ernest Hemmingway's biography that he never managed to learn French despite having lived in Paris for 8 years. He depended on his wife

One of the most ridiculous things I've been seeing is a lot of posts about people claiming to learn/want to learn like 8 languages. Now

&gt; Hey reddit, Russian and Arabic. I am using online resources, will it take me 2 or 3 years to be fluent in all of these?

Honestly

Because of where I live, and took classes before. Obviously, if you really work hard at a self-study program, immersion could do wonders for you, but just self studying will make very little progress. 

About learning languages at the same time: It is certainly possible, especially with similar languages, makes it all the more difficult. French Intermediate starting Korean? No problem there. Beginning Italian and Spanish at the same time? Terrible idea.

Basically, is bullshit. Look for anyway of validating a person's knowledge of a language before trusting their advice, unless you can verify it with a source outside of this subbreddit.

Lastly, tips, and the like. But like all of Reddit, it gets out of hand and there is a lot of bullshit that is inherently difficult to detect, but the aggregate of that bullshit becomes pretty obvious.

here are some things to consider:

**Personal interest:** If you hate kayaking, you probably will never learn to kayak worth a damn. The same applies to language learning. I loved learning Spanish, which made it easier to practice it, thus a good choice. I tried a bit of Dutch and that just didn't click for me, so naturally i didn't continue it. IMO, if you're not interested in a language or don't find it worthwhile, don't bother. the one exception being if you NEED to learn it


**Necessity:** Maybe your new job is in Italy or you're joining the Peace Corps. I don't know. But either way, the need factor will make it so that you eventually get the hang of it.


**Level of commitment:** the last thing i'd consider. Are you going to take a formal class? eventually visit? self study? This is a very very important factor. Different languages will be easier/harder based on your native tongue, and plain personal preferences. For example, someone who has never left Wyoming [rural part of America for non-US redditors] you will probably make very little progress self-studying Cantonese. But if, let's say, you know Spanish, English, and Portuguese


**Practicality:** I would say this is the least important but still something to consider. Well, it is. there is no ""best language to learn"" but each area has better choices. For example, if you are in business, Mandarin or Russian would be an excellent choice. Wolof, not so much. Or if you live in a community with a lot of Spanish speakers, it would probably be a better choice than Hmong.

1361329473.0,18v243,Michel Thomas method - a short subjective review,kewlar,55,6,19,"Someone asked me to do a short review of my experience with Michel Thomas method

I have completed MT French (Foundation, Spanish (Foundation), German (Foundation Review, as I had German in school), and now am in the process of learning Italian (Foundation and Advanced completed, Vocabulary in progress). I have also tried some Pimsleur and Rosetta Stone, and now am trying Duolingo and Memrise. I found Pimsleur to be seriously unsuitable for my needs (repetitive, impractical parrotting). Rosetta Stone - slow

If you don't know about Michel Thomas method, and [there are some samples on the website](http://www.michelthomas.com). Basically, it teaches you the ""structure of the language"" - i.e. sentence structure, verbs and how to use them (tenses and conjugations), teaches you to think in the target language, some practical vocabulary and pronunciation tips. Then it's up to you to build the vocabulary - Michel recommended reading, and I found that it worked for me.

Things I liked about the Michel Thomas courses:

* It enabled me to think in and to construct sentences (i.e. speak) in my target language. At his prompts
* I was able to do that a relatively short amount of time (in approx. two weeks
* I can learn while commuting. Or having a walk.
* The thing of building the structure first - it works!.
* The thing about building vocabulary by reading a little every day - it works!.
* Michel stresses the parts that matter (ex. Italian word endings -e and -i that change the meaning of the sentence)
* Also
* The ""ground rules"" of relaxing and letting the teacher to be responsible for the progress are a nice touch.
* It worked for me (tested in Morocco, and Italy. Was able to get directions, order food, settle conflicts, get out of tight places, haggle, and hold a few light conversations).

Things that could be better:

* It seems to me, like Rosetta Stone, or Duolingo, or Memrise. **Update** as [shrillthrill](http://www.reddit.com/user/shrillthrill) pointed out, the phrases taught are in the booklets available both in printed form, and as a PDF download, so that solves it. You still need to look it up.
* Some courses are better than others. Some are less good. In his Italian course, was excellent.
* Vocabulary courses periodically annoy me to no end. The woman in the Italian courses constantly messes up -i and -e endings where they matter, Vocabulary courses don't seem focus on making sure you remember what's on them that much - the material is not repeated as much as in the grammar courses. Then again, it may not matter much.
* The vocabulary taught is minimal. There are things that are lacking, that is easily acquired with any phrasebook or a simple Google search.

Things that have to be solved by other means:

* It does not teach reading. Or writing. It's an audio course
* It does not teach listening skills. That I found out the practical way - ""shit, but I have no idea what he's saying"". You get over it in a couple of days in the target environment.

If you decide to try it

* When the material got difficult, or on two consecutive days), instead of trying harder to remember.
* When you'll have to use your newly acquired language skills in a practical situation in a foreign country, and to understand what's being said to you. Relax, it's only natural. Your brain will adjust to using and understanding the new language quite quickly, and you'll feel like your're making exponential progress.

It's not by any means the silver bullet to language acquisition and retainment (I just found it to be the best for me) -- then again

There are some who complain about Michel's pronunciation, and that he makes sure to teach the parts that are important in order to be understood.

In the end

TL;DR: Try it

1.  The word ""fine"" is not the same as ""good"" or ""well.""  It means ""OK.""  If someone says they are ""fine, and not especially good or bad.  ""Fine"" is used often in statements of neutrality.  Saying to a native English speaker that you ""hope that they are fine"" sounds a little funny, even though we know what you're trying to say. ;)

2. English speakers use the verb ""to do"" to answer imperatives and commands.  When using the future tense, this can cause a bit of confusion, since they tend to use the issued verb when responding to commands.  ""I cleaned,"" ""I washed,"" and so on are understandable but sound funny. ;)

3. English is very descriptive and flexible and English speakers tend to use adjectives for a lot of things that you tend to ""have"" in romance languages.  English speakers are ""ticklish"" but don't ""have tickles.""  

4. When differentiating between ""in,"" it is often not literal.  You ride ""on"" the train, but stand ""in"" a house.  Spain is a country ""in"" the world and not a country ""of"" the world (although ""of"" is sometimes used here, too).  In many cases, it is possible to differentiate by deciding how something is physically placed.  You aren't on top of a line, so you're waiting ""in"" it.  In some cases, it is not: despite not being on top of the airplane

4. When describing groups of people, ""three of what?""  Three doctors?  Three adults? 

6. If you want to refer to something that exists in regionally within a country or political location, Spain and the Mediterranean Sea are ""south of France,"" but Paris is in ""northern France.""

2. Learn 25 Characters a day including their Pinyin form with the [HSK 1 Memrise Flashcard series](http://www.memrise.com/course/541/hsk-level-1-introductory-mandarin/)
In the beginning you could go a bit faster

3. Learn grammar and sentence construction through [ChinesePod.com](http://www.chinesepod.com) or put it all together using Rosetta's Stone. (Costly Option - but if you search the webs all these resources can be found for free

4. For speaking I just repeat every sound I hear in Memrise and the McGraw-Hill Software

1. Find an audio piece of media Arabic (I like the Euronews ch on youtube)
2. Ensure it has a transcript (hence Euronews)
3. Listen 2-3 times (I usually wait to take notes until #3 if I am writing in English.)
4. Transcribe the part that confuses you most (It's the three sentences where you only wrote ""Minister... Beirut... 27"").
5. Play the audio 2-3 times &amp; read along (I emphasize this to Ss... It helps me read at an ""Arab pace"" aka ""Al Jazeera Ticker"" pace).
6. Check your transcription and identify unknown/forgotten words in the passage
7. Use those words in context to create a ""news"" article.  Do this out-loud... if you write it first
8. Now write out that news article.  I create traditional vocab lists for Ss because they demand them.  Otherwise I study vocab in this context.
9. Profit
10. Wash and repeat.

3) **[Bród Club](http://www.rte.ie/brodclub)** -

Nor am I so focussed on whether I personally like or dislike the formats and features of the innovations.  

I'm just keen to get a survey of what is being tried for comparison. I'm especially interested in examples of new approaches that either combine education with entertainment to spur language interest and  learning and those that are specifically focussed on endangered or minority languages.

When the Borders near me was shutting down

The first half of the book is a history of English and other languages that relate to it.  The book was written post-WWII, the real gem is the last half of the book.

He has chosen 2000 vocabulary words for 8 non-English languages.  He says that he chose these words not because they are the most frequent words, words like ""go"" or ""have"" are not in the list.

Even more interesting is that he groups the Teutonic and Romance languages together so you can see the similarities between the languages like this:


&gt; English - air

&gt; Swedish - luft

&gt; Danish - Luft

&gt; Dutch - lucht

&gt; German - die Luft

and this:

&gt; English - air

&gt; French - l'air (m)

&gt; Portuguese - o ar

At first, but found myself bored by the flashcard style of teaching and unable to retain what I was 'learning.' And so I trudged my way through Level 4 but gave up and never bothered with Level 5. This was several months ago.


Recently, and I haven't looked back since. I downloaded Spanish Advanced, blew threw it in a weekend, and have never felt more comfortable with my conversational Spanish. Since then I have worked my way through the French Foundation course, am currently in the middle of the French Advanced course, and plan on beginning the German course shortly.


There are many shortcomings to the MTM, Michel's method of language teaching is unparalleled. As a student of over 10 languages, he is able to make connections that most teachers don't even know exist. There is no rote memorization, but rather an ability to understand the origins and dynamics of the language. In short, Michel makes learning a foreign language feel natural.

If I could recommend one thing to any prospective language leaner out there it would be this: before you do *anything*, and be able to make connections that would otherwise be nonexistent. Good luck everyone!

Hey guys. Some time ago I posted the first version of my language learning plugin, and several people wanted a dictionary feature. I finally got around to implementing that, and I've been happy with the results. 

Now you can build a dictionary to really focus on the words you're trying to pick up. You can let the dictionary grow to translate a bunch of random words

The free translation service I use isn't perfect by any means (sometimes its hilariously bad) but with your own dictionary you can easily fix any errors you notice and learn as you go. I know there are several similar plugins

Apologies in advance if you consider this spammy. I make no money from this

If you're curious, so that everyone can benefit from improvements and so that groups (like a class), can easily share the vocabulary they're focused on at a particular time. Please let me know if you have any feedback or recommendations.

You can try the plugin [here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/flewent/kboplipnhaapngnahmdgminfepnokjhh),,False,self,t5_2rjsc,False,,True

So far I have spent that gift playing Counter-Strike and sleeping through most days. But I have decided to learn French. I am surrounded by polygots (mostly from Sweden and Norway) and I want to join them.

So today is the start of my attempt to learn French. In fact I have a deadline

Additionally

My resources include -

- The Coffeeshop French podcast lessons.
- The Dualingo, MosaFrench and Frenchlite iPhone apps.
- Memrise.com
- A book called 'Le francais de tous les jours' that my family gave me last time I saw them in the UK. I think the title means 'Everyday French'. It seems to lack any English translations
- Some hot French girl I know who also lives in Singapore.
- I have changed the language on Facebook to French. Although all I have learned from this is that 'status' becomes 'statut'.
- Anything else I can find for free on the internet.

So I was wondering if anyone would be interested if I put weekly updates on my progress or something like that. To keep themselves motivated etc.

While you're reading you can tap a word and get a pop-up definition or translation (currently supporting Swedish, Spanish, and Arabic). The context-sensitivity of the definitions is what separates this from automated definition translation technologies, in that this is actually accurate. The reason it's called Flikkt is because while reading in the app you can save words you're trying to learn to your personal dictionary (called a Flikktionary) by flicking them downwards. Here, you can review them and use them in word games etc.

1357363367.0,15zsuc,Rosetta World - Free language practice with native speakers ,kaka3,35,1,14,"EDIT: http://rworld.com/

Rosetta Stone offers this free service of speaking and playing games with native speakers of your target language.

I'm assuming the service is free because most of their market is in the US. Part of their package includes being able to speak with native speakers so they've opened it up to everyone.

The downside is that there are still not a lot of users (I'm going to re-post in a couple of more language learning subreddits because I think many can profit from this tool). I'm using Spanish - there's usually always an opportunity to find a native speaker learning English.

The way the games work is that you do the first 4-6min session (or for however long you want to chat) in one language

The site recommends you be at conversation level and won't let you check ""beginner"" for you language level (I'm guessing this is so they can get you to buy their product and learn) but as long as you're comfortable holding a simple conversation or talk about a simple topic prompted by the program

I'd like to share a method to get better once you've already learnt quite a bit of your target language. You need at least to be loosely conversational
It's nothing supernatural
It's basically watching commented video games playthroughs on youtube and elsewhere, it's completely free and some of these are real comedy gold. Also, without noticing, watching an entire playthrough will get you dozens of hours of practice. You'll also notice that some commentators are very easy to understand while others will give you a hard time, so you can modulate the difficulty (it's no use if you can't get a word of what they say). For example, one commentator, Crendor, slow american english while Jesse Cox has a midwest accent and always make voices which is one step harder. I personally rank the british accents of Totalbiscuit and the yogcast among the most difficult

&gt;Some more on language learning.

&gt;1. Motivation: find some good motivation.  The greater the importance, it's time consuming.  Also, if you are motivated, you will enjoy it more, and learn faster.

&gt;2. Emotion: Language learning is one of the most emotional things to learn because it directly challenges our own identity and our ability to communicate with others.  People who won't try new things out of fear

&gt;3. Ambiguity: This also includes tolerance of ambiguity.  When we listen to foreign languages

&gt;3. Pre-immersion:  Before learning a language, whatever.  Listen to music.  This will help to raise your tolerance for ambiguity and make the language feel less foreign and threatening. If you can get a TV series that will hook you, all the better.

&gt;4. Make connections: usually we learn a language to connect with a new group of people.  Try doing that before or while you're learning a language.  There are lots of sites you can get a pen pal or Skype friend if you can't find a language exchange partner.  If you have a social and developing emotional connection to the language

&gt;5. Get a good teacher.

&gt;6. Practice.  Use the internet

&gt;7. If you can, especially as an adult, where repetition is high and the stimulation is constant.

Some other things you can do:

1. Listen to Filipino radio - When you first start to listen to the language, you may hear a lot of slang/shortened terms - but this is all part of the fun! Then later start to listen for only key words, then learn more vocab, and start to try and figure out sentences.

2. Talk to Filipino friends after you have some of the basics, and question them about using words properly and grammar properly. I think it is better to make a lot of mistakes to see where you can improve. From personal experience, the filipino people I have practised to when I was learning the language were always happy to help, as well as appreciative.

3. When talking, ""Do you want pupunta sa shopping mall ngayon gabi kasama ni kami?""

4. Go to the philippines (even for three weeks if you dont want to go for long)- although most people speak english there, and its more rewarding personally. This will be one of the ultimate tests of using the language (you will also impress the locals quite a lot, and they don't care if you make some mistakes, they will most likely laugh it off and correct you.)

5. Watch as much filipino media you can (movies

6. Read online tagalog news sites if you want (such as GMA News)
Although GMA news is mainly in English

I actually learned this years ago as a way of improving my presentation skills in English, so"", and other things that don't sound very elegant when speaking. If you speak slower and naturally insert pauses periodically (they'll feel much longer to you than they actually are), then your mouth ends up moving at the same speed or even slower than your brain, which means it's never searching for stuff to say or getting ahead of itself.

I think this can help when speaking in your target language. One of the biggest difficulties, I can put the subject after the verb. This means that sometimes, I'll find myself in a situation where I don't know enough German to finish the sentence I started given the verb I have chosen. So I either say something wrong and awkward sounding, start the sentence over, or confuse whoever I am speaking with. I might want to say something like

But then, but can't make them into nouns on the fly. Or I might know another expression (anständig sich benehmen). Anyway, I noticed if I just slow down and think a little I can start the sentence in a way that doesn't get me stuck in any corners.

As a beginner, I found it easy to communicate with the people because I was basically at the communication level of a 10-year old. I don't recommend this for anyone who is fairly proficient.

Native speakers of X needed!",bromega,33,4,33,"The following Czech-English connectors derived from http://www.anthonylauder.com/ , stumbling ways of connecting even our very few ideas.  With these 'connectors' we can essentially give language learners a huge boost in fluency and ability to communicate by filling in all those 'missing links' between what we'd like to say

My request is that native speakers of any language submit a list similar to this

unfortunately his list is too long to copy pasta

""

When you are asked a question

Opening connectors are really useful for getting the first few words out of your mouth (“breaking the silence”) while you settle down to give the real answer to the question.

Imagine you are asked where you are from

You can get some breathing space by starting out with:

“To je dobrá otázka ...” then once the momentum is going your brain relaxes and it is much easier to keep going and say “… (I am from England) jsem z Anglie”
Filler Connectors

Filler connectors are throw-away phrases you can insert when you need a little more thinking time.

They give the illusion of deep pondering

understandably
	

pochopitelně

frankly speaking
	

upřímě řečeno

between you and me
	

mezi námi řečeno

anyway
	

nicméně

well then
	

nuže tedy

well
	

no

how can I put it?
	

jak bych to řekl?

I must say that
	

musím říct

firstly
	

za prvé

secondly
	

za druhé

I would like you to know that
	

rád bych

I am afraid that
	

obávám se

now and then it seems to me that
	

chvilemi se mi zdá

after all
	

přece jenom

as far as I am concerned
	

co se mě týče

more and more
	

čím dál víc

actually
	

vlastně

all joking aside
	

konec srandy

now seriously
	

teď vážně

As an example

“(Where) Kde (do you live) bydlíte?”

If your brain panics

“(Between you and me) Mezi námi řečeno (I live in Prague) bydlím v Praze”
Apologising Connectors

When you make a mistake, it is all too easy to blush, panic, and revert to your own language.

Instead

They will get you over the embarrassment hurdle so you can carry on.

don't be upset
	

nezlobte se

it was a slip of the tongue
	

to mi uklouzlo

I said it by mistake
	

řekl jsem to omylem

I am sorry that
	

omlouvám se
Qualifying Connectors

Czechs tend to not be overly impressed with show-offs

To soften a statement

There are loads of these

to tell the truth
	

abych pravdu řekl

I presume that
	

já se domnívám

I hope that
	

doufám že

in my opinion
	

podle mého názoru

if that is true
	

jestli je to pravda

I don't know exactly
	

já nevím přesně

I would like to think that
	

chtěl bych myslet že

the way I see it is that
	

vidím to tak

as you may know
	

jak asi víte

I don't have a big interest in that
	

nemám velký zájem o to

if I understand correctly
	

rozumím-li dobře

as you already know
	

jak už víte

that isn't such a big problem
	

to není takový velký problém

1. Are there new grammatical structures that will postpone fluency? (look at SOV vs. SVO

2. Are there new sounds that will double or quadruple time to fluency? (especially vowels)

3. How similar is it to languages I already understand? What will help and what will interfere? (Will acquisition erase a previous language? Can I borrow structures without fatal interference like Portuguese after Spanish?)

I have a noted head start in this too, as I already know the katakana and hiragana scripts, and, as previously mentioned, the writings of the common-use Kanji. I have exposed myself much more to Japanese culture through reading and research, so I'm more familiar with it than that of China. I also watch quite a deal of anime, but still notable I suppose.

I've recently embarked on a bit of an insane task to learn many (many) languages and had something probably quite familiar in these parts niggling away at me. I've settled it for myself but I was curious as to others' reasons and thoughts.

In an age where English is spoken by many (though certainly not all), why did you start picking up a language?

Were you aware of the feeling among some that learning a second language is

1370634595.0,1fvsu7,How I multiplied my Anki efficiency by 5,MaunoBrau,22,1,5,"I have been using SRS flashcard programs for many years

Recently

First

**What I expected

All [SRS (Spaced-Repitition Software) programs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition) are based on the [forgetting curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forgetting_curve) that was hypothesized by [Hermann Ebbinghaus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermann_Ebbinghaus). The gist of this as I have understood it is that when you learn something, minutes, or hours. The next time you learn the same item, the time grows longer. This amplifies each time you relearn the same thing until theoretically, you will remember the bit of information for your entire life.

So, go through all the cards I have due, and then add as many new cards as I can with the time I want to devote to it.

Whenever I start a new deck (and I have started many, and it feels great. Then, after a few days the due cards start coming in. At first, I just switch my daily habits and deal with all the due cards and then fill in some more time adding new cards. Then, the number of due cards starts going up and up. Then, I skip a few days for whatever reason, and I suddenly have a huge pile of due cards, because I am following the recommended practices

In addition to backlog glut, then my mind automatically goes into a mode where I just look for a pattern of that word, phrase or sentence, and I ""guess"". The problem with this is that what ends up happening is that, given a long enough time, I end up seeing this same card over and over and over and over again without ever actually learning it. The other problem is that I seem to spend an inordinate amount of time on cards that I am having a lot of difficulty with. This gets to the point where it dominates the time I spend with a deck. This is boring and demotivating.

**My epiphany

Recently a couple of things triggered for me at the same time. The first thing that happened was that I was close to the point where I wanted to abandon multiple decks at the same time. I realized this and wanted to try and avoid it. I took a mental step back and realized that what I really love about studying flashcards is the process of seeing new flashcards. I like the process of seeing a new phrase or sentence, so it is very rewarding to me when that happens. So, I started taking a break from reviewing any old cards. I basically said, ""screw it! I'm just going to abandon them anyway,"" so I figured I may as well at least get some happiness out of reviewing more new cards. I found that this was quite enjoyable.

The second thing that happened is that I encountered a new blurb about Ebbinghaus. I think it was here on reddit, then he would learn it again and time himself. What he found was that after he learned a given list, two things were true. First, he would be able to recall it for longer and longer periods of time. Second, after he forgot it, it would take less and less time to learn it again.

This second thing is what struck me. It seems so obvious, I had this sinking feeling that I was losing those cards and I would have to start over with learning them if I didn't get on it and get them reviewed. Now, I realize that no matter how long those sit there, when I do eventually get back to them, it will take me less time to relearn them when I try again.

It also dawned on me that if I let enough time go by, I started switching gears every few days. I have been adjusting my Anki settings to 0 reviews and 500 new per day to 2000 reviews and 0 new per day and back again whenever I feel like (seems like every few days).

This has been ... awesome. I have been letting my due cards build up to 1000 or 1500, but for most of them, I just crank through them. After a couple of days when I whittle through most of them, I start to get down to where it is feeling boring, repetitious, and my mind starts seeking quick pattern recognition over actual understanding. When this happens, I turn off reviews and crank through a bunch of new cards for a few days.

The result of this switch is that on the deck that I am focusing on, 2900, and 3500. I've been adding at least 1000 new cards per week. I used to add about 100 per week, but not every week. I've been using this deck for 20 weeks. It is a list of 24000 Russian sentences. I am now about 4000 cards in.

About 7 months ago I asked for feedback on my vocabulary learning app that I wrote as a training exercise

Adoption was slow but steady. About 100 people downloaded the app per week, about $2 per month.

The inverse version (teaching German speakers English words) was a total failure

I just released French and Spanish versions

So it certainly isn't a smashing success

Now I'm thinking whether I should abandon the project and move on to something more innovative, and select ""Picture Source"" -&gt; Instagram)!

Some ideas I had:

* Add more words (duh)
* Add a phrase for each word to improve retention
* Add a phrase trainer
* Leverage crowd sourcing: Allow users to add their own words and pictures, if they're helpful
* Make statistics more accessible and transparent
* Improve Instagram mode (keep track of which pictures were guessed correctly immediately

Any other ideas?
I'll mostly likely start working on an iOS version later this year!

Additionally, but it still needs improvement. Obviously this is the case with all intermediate speakers, but I have no idea what exactly to study or how to study it. Straight up memorization works for the short term, but it doesn't stick very well. Is there some standard form of practice for people at my level, or is it just acquired over time? I'm not in any hurry to learn to language, but it bothers me that I have to keep pausing midsentence because I don't know a word. And that happens *a lot*.

I am in a very lucky position that I get to share with my child 3 languages. Dutch

There is a small issue though. I don't like the Dutch teachings. I don't like my thought processes in Dutch and (sadly) since I hardly speak Dutch


I know that the main things we teach our children are unconscious. The way we talk to strangers


To learn another language as your mother tongue you need to hear/speak it at least 33% of the time you are awake

Spanish is easy; the entire family and my husband will speak Spanish + school + friends.

Dutch and English are not as easy.

There are 2 options;

Either I will speak Dutch to the child, TV (like sesame street) and songs will be in Dutch as well as my parents talking on the phone or skype with the child once a week.

If I speak Dutch my fear is that I will unconsciously teach my child all kinds of crap stuff, and that others are more important than yourself.

If I speak English my fear is that my child will not grow up being fluent in Dutch, without accent? (Important if they ever want to live in the Netherlands!!) And will they be able to speak easily with their grandparents, who don't speak English?

I am not worried about fluency in English because we plan to sent him/her to a bilingual school anyway


(We live in Mexico, just a few mistakes here and there, my husband and I both are fluent in English, and my husband understands basic Dutch)
