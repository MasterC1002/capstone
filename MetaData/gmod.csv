I have lot's of experience with both Dark RP and Gmod.

 What is Dark RP? 

Dark RP is a mod for a gmod that let's you roleplay

In Dark RP you can 

Get a job, make your own job, own a house, and even marry [Not in the mod, but you can advert it]

Once you first join you will normally be greeted with the MOTD normally showing the server's rule's or  the server's website!

To get started you want to press F4 And you will be greeted with a menu
You will want to make you're way over to Job's and choose one of the many job's you can have!

My server is custom so there are more job's than the regular dark rp.
Some of the job's would be Citizen-default, Mayor, hobo, Mob boss, Swat, Medic, and gun dealer!

Each of these job's has it's own salary

there are many diffrent map's to choose from the best in my opinion is rp_downtown_v4c it is a fairly small map and easy to remember.

Admin's.

The admin group's are

Admin
Superadmin
Some server's let you donate for these ranks if you would like to help the server including mine but are very strict. Normally you get one chance when you donate for admin like

here are some of the rules for Dark RP

Rdm- Random Death Match aka don't randomly kill people 

Nlr- When you die you cannot return to that location for at least five minutes. So if you are killed you cannot return to that spot for at least five minutes!

This is a basic guide to Dark RP there is much more to learn about the mod. 

[You do not need to install anything to play dark rp]

If you would like to join my server just tell me in comment's!

I don't use this site often, but to also provide professional staffing. You won't see admin abuse on here. We've been doing this kind of thing for years, and our reward is seeing a full server operating smoothly. When we join a random DarkRP server, we typically wind up leaving appalled at the things we see in there. That's what prompted us to give this a shot.

If you've been looking for a decent roleplay server, including but not limited to:

* Custom money printers with numerous functions including overclocking, sound muffling, battery power and cooling units
* An economy system controlled by the mayor
* A TF2 hat vendor for you to show how rich you are in-game (because people seem to eat that stuff up :P)
* A robbable bank vault that increases in funds over time
* Growable drug plants
* and much more

Suggestions are always welcome as well as any feedback. You'll only wind up getting banned for breaking rules (we have a zero tolerance policy that we enforce to keep the idiots at bay) and on the off-chance a wrongful ban is given out

So

To get in touch with me personally

**EDIT:** The best time to get on is the later afternoon EDT.

67thway was originally supposed to be a basic suburban environment where there would be buildings on two sides of a road full of destroyed/unoccupied cars. I loved dm_richland


A friend of mine (goes by the name of redcow. He made ttt_concentration, he'd give a lot of suggestions to add more detail to each bit of the map. And I can't take full credit for the cars, honestly. He taught me how to efficiently use a func_tracktrain so that I could use them for the cars. The only thing I did not make on my map was the tester. As he let me use his own. Great guy honestly.

I'm not going to give too much away though. I'll let your minds wander. What I will tell you all though, and much more underground areas. I plan to have most of the guns to be underground to force innocents into close quarters situations more often. Obviously there'll still be a couple above ground, but much less. There probably won't be another tester due to various complaints.

So we've been working on this for about two months, because our gaming group makes up nine people, so some of us are much better at building than others.  The recording of the first episode took something like three and a half hours, but has been edited down into a more watchable twenty-five minutes.

The reason I'm posting here is to ask: Is this sort of series something [/r/gmod](/r/gmod) would be interested in?  I've posted here asking that before, I did post a link in [/r/gaming](/r/gaming), only because I don't think they'd take the time to read through all this.  I'm very passionate about getting this series off the ground, so if I have to get a link karma point or two, then I guess it's a necessary evil (joking, of course).

I am making a Garry's Mod gamemode. It will be my first real coding project. I am making good progress so far and have lots of ideas.

I am not sure if my ideas will appeal to a very small or large audience.
I want to get some feedback

Here are my ideas so far:
It is a class based team vs team game, as I think they are very well balanced. Each class will have its pros and cons.

The maps can be large and open with vehicles

Depending on the map

Each team has a base with sniper towers and destructible walls so that vehicles can drive into the base and annihilate the enemy team

The bases will either have a flag that needs to be captured

Please give me any feedback or suggestions

I re-spawn and follow NLR by not going up stairs where all the action and the place I died at. I exit the police spawn and boom get shot by the guy I got killed by ( I didn't notice it was him ) as soon as I exit the spawn
