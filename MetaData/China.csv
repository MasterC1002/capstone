1360318513.0,184ifa,So You’re Going to Your Girlfriend’s Hometown for Chinese New Year:  Thoughts on Making the Best of It,mjwd,419,55,153,"Having a long-term relationship with a Chinese woman can have its challenges.  You’ll often wonder what language you should speak together

When you step through the front door of her relative's house down in the provinces, “Hā luó!”  Laugh, and tell him his pronunciation is perfect.

You will be offered something to eat and a glass of boiling water with loose tea leaves.  Tell them you already ate

You will be asked if Spring Festival is celebrated in your home country.  Saying that the West stopped using the lunar calendar in the 16th Century might sound like a criticism of China’s 5, but China as a whole has never really gotten on the bandwagon.  Purgatory must be crowded.

Hopefully you brought unique gifts from your home country, not an iPhone.  Do not mention that you flew on Spring Airlines.  You should probably throw the airline luggage tags away before you get there.

At some point the Diaoyu Islands will be mentioned.  (Next year it will be some other territory.)  There are two options to deal with this.  The first is to completely dodge the issue.  The best way to do this is to say

If drinking has already started when this issue comes up, offering to switch orange juice if he can’t handle alcohol.  The goal is to have him be the first one to quit drinking.

Here is a list of territorial disputes you can drink to:

* Socotra Rock (中国苏岩礁
* Spratly Islands (中国南沙群岛
* South Tibet (中国藏南
* Macclesfield Bank (中国中沙群岛
* Paracel Islands (中国西沙群岛
* Scarborough Shoal (中国黄岩岛
* Trans-Karakoram Tract (中国喀喇昆仑走廊
* Maritime Province (中国滨海边疆区

By the time you get to the Paracel Islands, declare that you hope there are no Japanese products in the house, because you are boycotting them.  There will be a round of cheers, assuring you that they have all boycotted Japanese goods.  Ignore the fact that you were picked up from the airport in a Toyota, the elevator in the building was made by Mitsubishi, the television that will be on all evening is made by Sony, all the kitchen appliances used to prepare the food were produced by Sino-Japanese joint ventures

During the dinner, but spit it out into a napkin if it is inedible, like the chicken skull.  Don't ask what it is called.  You don't know the Chinese word for ""duck vagina,"" anyway.

If you have planned ahead, skin, and a jagged bone sticking out of it?  That's a fuck-you-treat.  A fuck-you-treat is something one culture finds appealing, but another culture does not.  The Western World's most formidable fuck-you-treat is Blue cheese.  Offer everyone a large piece, and then remark how good it smells.  When everyone has reluctantly swallowed and is trying to keep it down, tell them how you let it sit on your balcony for three weeks before it got this good. 

At some point in the evening, and tell him you will give it serious consideration after the holidays. You know the phone number you used while studying abroad here that you still remember?  Give that to him.  It was an honest, intoxicated mistake.

You will notice you have not seen your girlfriend for a long time.  The men and women have separated.  The men are trying to see how much alcohol you can drink before dying

Stumble into the room, and start acting like you have confused her with your girlfriend.  This will either be met with laughter and the grandma will accept you, or you will never be invited back again.  Both outcomes have their benefits.

At night, they will turn off the heating at night to save a few yuan.

Hopefully you brought some snacks in your backpack, nor their relation to your girlfriend.  ""Is she the *dàyí* or the *sānyí*? Shit.""

From then on you just act like a sport and take cues from your girlfriend.  You only have to go through this for a few more days,False,,t5_2qh2v,1360318693.0,,,t3_184ifa

*50 RMB: you have to be in a really podunk city

*100-150 RMB: BBS (which stands for barbershop). Full sex, condom on. I think the name comes from fake barbershops that have a really bare ""fake barbershop"" first floor. It's super obvious bc there's like all of one chair, like no hair products, and just a bunch of skimpily dressed girls standing around. You then get led to the second floor for the sex. I don't see many of these anymore though. Now the telltale sign is pink lighting, and frosted glass doors. Often the frosted glass will have a clear strip so you can see the girls inside. They're typically sitting on a red couch doing absolutely nothing. Works the same way though. They're practically on every other street in every single city.

*500 RMB: Outcall girls with agencies. When you sleep in a two star hotel and get stuffed those small notecards under your door, prob 40ish minutes. The girls in general are pretty mediocre and look like they just got off work at the factory. You are technically allowed to turn her away at the door if you don't like her, but usually you gotta pay roundrip cabfare.

*700 RMB: solo prostitutes. They do their own advertising, the reviews are written by themselves (ie advertisements). Ask for a picture, cam if you're lucky (but usually no cam), and ask for the rate. Don't bullshit around about getting to know them and shit. They don't want to waste time. If they do waste time, it means they're desperate for business and not in demand.

One pop, but we all know that's not the truth. It's some silly mythos of the poor university girl trying to become a doctor and being short on rent. They can be bitchy though, since there's no oversight agency.

*600-1500: Sauna prostitutes. Any sauna building with a bright billboard and flashing lights, shower, change out of your clothes and into their PJs, then hang around the communal level. There's TV, pool, food/fruit, drinks, you go to the hookers floor. A supervisor will greet you and ask you what kind of girl you want. I advise slipping him 50-100 RMB so that he brings you quality girls. They'll send anywhere from 3 to 20+ girls and have them line up in front of you. When they introduce themselves, you can either let them take the lead, etc.)

*1500-2500+: KTV prostitutes. Any KTV building with bright billboards and flashing ights, depending on how much she likes you and how strict the place is. Sitting fee (they chill with you, flirt with you, etc.) is usually 300 ish. Also gotta hit spending limit for the KTV room (500 RMB ish), and tip the DJ (person who operates the KTV system so you don't have to yourself) and shit for another 100-200. You can take them back to your hotel for one session (so like 3hrs) for an extra 700, or take them back for the night for 1000+.  Anything goes if they really like you.

**Edit for those who are offended**: I'm sorry that you are offended

**Edit 3**: blanket response to some common objections

&gt;Over the past decade

* *Prostitutes are abused, etc.*: yes true.

&gt;Apart from incidences of violence directly associated with prostitution, in the course of attempts to steal their money and property.[47] There have also been a growing number of criminal acts, especially incidences of theft and fraud directed at men who buy sex, as well as bribery of public servants.

Also in this bag is any form of financial/psychological coercion.

Unfortunately that is rampant across all industries in China. If you keep up with news in China at all, I still eat at restaurants (I'll only hire you if you sleep with me), I still go to the bank (I'll only promote you if you sleep with me). 

* *""Okay maybe you are nice to prostitutes, even if there are abusive alcoholics.

* *Everything you wrote is anecdotal only*: the whole ""well that's just your personal experience man"" is too commonly used. If I've visited a number of establishments in various cities, please link it.

* *This is bad for /r/China*. One single thread should not and does not represent a whole forum

* *You are fat and lonely and can't get laid otherwise*: I mainly see expats picking up prostitutes in bars. I've never seen them in saunas. I see them in KTVs very rarely. 99% of customers I've seen are natives. People visit prostitution for so so so many reasons. They might be unattractive (physically or personality wise) and can't get the companionship otherwise. They might be out of town on business and can't put in the time to get laid the traditional way. They might be husbands who are tired of their wives. They might just be seeking the new experience for the thrill of it. They might be virgins who can't overcome their sexual anxiety. (And lastly

**The Controller

**The Controller**

The Controller was the first guy I dated here

See, and no knowledge of what “proper” (according to Chinese culture) social interaction consists of. Your knowledge of the things happening around you is limited to how you perceive them through the “western culture” filter in your mind, and since there is a huge language/communication disconnect between you and everyone around you- the truth is *so* easy to manipulate.  

As I got more and more fluent in Chinese, he'd have every Chinese person at the party raving about how amazing and inspirational our “love story” is- even when his version of the story wasn't even half true. He would also constantly “mis-translate” things I would say- and when confronted about it- he'd claim it was an accident. 

He also had me convinced that several of our mutual friends were no longer interested in hanging out with me. But of course,” regardless of whether or not it actually is.

So piece of advice number 1- **learning Chinese** is absolutely paramount to successfully avoiding a situation like mine. And if you find your date “mistranslating” for you or encouraging you to rely on him to the point of being socially handicapped- take that as a huge red flag

---

**The Fu Er Dai** 

This guy was an almost comical caricature of every fu er dai stereotype there is. He loved everything western- luxury brands, alcohol, and women. In the short time I was seeing him, he went through about 3 or 4 cars, bought closets full of brand name clothes, and seemed to be constantly jetting around the country, spending almost every other weekend in Shanghai. He was also the kind of rich where if he called you up and said,” you'd have to ask

But the weird thing is- he was actually one of the best guys I've ever had the chance to meet. Not only was he honest, being loud, drinking beer, messily eating 串 by the roadside or smoking in a public place. And after doing so many things that would make you an irrevocable “bad girl” in the eyes of most Chinese- he'd tell you to “do whatever makes you happy” and not to care about the opinions of close-minded assholes. The two of us together could make almost any situation fun- grocery shopping, aimlessly driving around, taking a walk or exploring the city's deserted apartment complexes at midnight.

I started dating him at the point where my Chinese was pretty good. Which is lucky- because he couldn't string a single fluent English sentence together and wasn't about to apologize for it. Although he could manage a “fuck you” every once in a while, and that's never a bad thing.

So where did my relationship with Fu Er Dai end up? Well- he's a busy guy with a fast-paced life

I never asked for or accepted a single material possession from him in our entire relationship- but before parting

**Mr. Popular**

Mr. Popular is my current boyfriend. I gotta say, competitions, and activities.

So it seems great, his academic achievements will go down in our university's history, he's involved with many hobbies, and he has a huge support network and safety net. And last but not least- he's also slightly locally famous for dating *me*. What could possibly go wrong? 

Almost everything could go wrong. See, on-the-fast-track-to-marriage kind of serious.  

So what would happen now if I decided I didn't want to settle down at the tender age of 21? What if

So the final tip- tip number 3. **Make sure your relationship is somewhat secret until you're absolutely sure you're serious about him.** Once it becomes “serious”- he is going to brag to every single friend and distant relative he has about his beautiful 爱情故事 of borderless love

So what to take away from this one? **Be very aware of the development of your relationship with a Chinese guy**- because it can go from “just friends” to “betrothed” before you even have time to notice it. Chinese social circles seem to be a lot bigger than western ones- and that's a lot of people who at best, will vilify you. This is most true for those of us who live in small cities- in Beijing or Shanghai- you ladies are lucky enough to probably get a free pass on this one.

I'm graduating with my BA this June. I'm sick of where I live, because one of my best friends is currently teaching in Dalian and his experiences there have been resoundingly positive. His contract is up in September and we plan to travel together a while (2-3 weeks) before we go our separate ways and I settle down somewhere and start looking for work. I've saved up roughly $10,000 which should last a while and cover start up costs and all that.

I've dealt with recruiters online, with a Bachelor's Degree and from what I've read, that should be ample qualification to find a teaching gig. I'm hoping to find work in a ""2nd tier"" city, if my understanding of the tier system is correct - from what I've read and heard, Dalian, Nanjing, Qingdao and Xiamen all sound like awesome cities. I'm not entirely sure where I'll end up, but I plan on visiting some of these places and connecting with the expat communities there and hearing some firsthand accounts of what it's like to live there before I make up my mind definitively. Is it realistic to expect to be able to find employment in said cities

I want to work legally, I should be able, with a letter of invitation from a potential employer, to covert my tourist visa to a z visa via Bangkok or HK or possibly through Mongolia. Is this correct? I want to be patient and find a respectable employer to work for legally. I don't want to get roped into working illegally for a shady employer on a tourist visa. Ideally, I would like to work for ~20 hours a week. What do you suppose a reasonable salary to expect may be? I realize this answer depends largely on which city I'll be working in, but I'd like to make at least 6000RMB per month. Is this realistic?

What do you think of my plan? I know I'm young and naive but I'm just looking for something different; I realize that living in China will have its challenges, to dedicating my time to my interests and living humbly and for all of the interesting people I'll undoubtedly meet.

1367821619.0,1ds29v,For female expats looking for info/resources/personal experience about having an abortion in China.,,212,34,56,"I just wanted to share my story in case (like I was) there is another female expat out there looking for information on the experience of having an abortion in China. I was frantically searching the web for information on this when I found out I was pregnant here and found next to nothing

I found out I was pregnant while doing May Day vacation with my (Chinese) boyfriend in Beijing. I live and study in a small town in northern Shaanxi province

We did the test back at our hotel and it was positive. 

Our time in Beijing was running out and I accepted the fact that we'd have to wait to go back to our small

We came back on a Friday night, and I highly reccomend it. Very modern, clean and (somewhat) professional.

The first order of business was to check in (挂号). We filled out a simple paper with my name, and handed it to the clerk. She formatted and gave us a special card (looks like a credit card with a barcode) that electronically tracks the proceedures you do and the perscriptions you get. That was kinda cool. The check in proceedure is simple and any expat with basic Chinese skills can do it alone. The card and check in cost 10 yuan.

Next we go upstairs and find the women's health/OBGYN area (妇产科). It's important to note at this particular hospital, because waiting in the OBGYN area for so long was a little awkward, especially when all the Chinese people around are going to be asking you questions/trying to talk to you/find out why you're there.

When all the doctors got back from lunch, they typed up some things on the computer, scanned our card, and printed out a slip/form (单子) for an ultrasound. Before doing each procedure or test, you have to pay. So we paid downstairs, got a receipt, and took the receipt back upstairs to the ultrasound place.

I'm not sure why they do ultrasounds to check for pregnancy rather than a typical pee test

I waited my turn and went into the room. They had me unbutton my pants and tiny bit, they have to press really hard to get a picture and it was a little uncomfortable, but it doesn't really *hurt*. On the screen, they highlighted a part which I suppose is the fetus, and confirmed I was pregnant, and then they printed out a page with two pictures of the results. The ultrasound cost around 60 yuan.

After that, we got a slip they we took downstairs to pay with and then headed up to the testing room. I think you can see by now that there's a lot of running around in this process. The whole shibang takes an entire afternoon, so plan accordingly. 

The ECG is my least favorite because you have to (partially) take off your shirt, but quite frankly the least of my problems at the time. It was a simple test that took less than 2 minutes and cost about 40 yuan. It's the same ECG test you probably got after applying for a job/to a university.

We ran back to the office and got another slip for the next test- a blood test. This cost about 65 yuan and was simple, okay.

So by this point we had done an ultrasound, they have to get many people done in a short amount of time so they do it assembly-line style. My boyfriend couldn't come into this room with me so I had to communicate with the doctor myself, which really isn't a problem. She gave me a little blue sheet, told me to put it on the chair, remove ONE LEG of my pants and underwear then lie on the table. 

There are a lot of girls going in and out of and around these rooms

At this time there's another girl behind the curtain beside me and she's getting undressed too, disposable, plastic speculum from its package. 

The attitude and method they use while conducting this exam is similar to how some people feel that ripping off a bandaid as fast and as violently as possible will get it over sooner and with less suffering. So she shoves (there was actual shoving going on) the speculum into my vagina, she pulls it out after mentioning it's all normal down there. The next step was to, as she put it, ""摸一下"" where she put two fingers inside me and pressed down onto my abdomen with the other hand. That wasn't pleasant either but it was leagues better than step 1. She 摸'd in 3 places, each time asking, ""疼不疼?"" to which I answered 不疼. Then it was over and I could finally get up and put my pants on. 

As I was wrangling with my jeans and boots I could hear her move on to examine the girl next to me, but the sounds she made sounded Japanese AV-esque and was really disturbing.

So with the last examination over we could go to the office again and get the final verdict from the two ladies. They looked over all the tests and said I was fit for an abortion. 

There are two options. Medical abortion (药流) and surgical abortion (人工流产手术 which is abbreviated as 人流). Before you jump on it and immediately choose the medical abortion, the medical abortion only has an 80% effectiveness (not sure if that's true), sometimes causing incomplete abortions. Also there's a much longer recovery period and many nasty side effects like vommiting and nausea and excess bleeding. 

Also it's not as if you can just take the medication and go home to abort in peace, who will watch you bleed out for what can be up to 3 hours. They have to ensure that the fetus is completely aborted so I imagine there's some inspecting of the stuff coming out of you going on.

It's not at all as pleasant or non-invasive as it seems at first. So I chose surgical abortion, because I was still worried even after going home about them accidently misunderstanding and changing it back to the epidural option, getting an injection in the spine is not something anyone looks forward to.

So the day is over

The morning rolls around and I go to the hospital bright and early. We have to walk around and find the doctor who for some reason wasn't in his office at the time (the only male doctor in the entire process you will meet is probably going to be the one who does the actual abortion). So we find him, clean looking room with lots of equipment and everything was all ready for me. I take off one leg of my pants and underwear and mount the table. I was surprised that so many doctors (5 or 6) were present for the operation.

I'm in the room without my boyfriend so I chat with the doctors while they're preparing. They put an IV drip in one hand and a heart moniter on the other. It was the first time they discovered I could actually speak Chinese so we all had a laugh while the female nurses compliment my skin tone and looks. They strap my legs onto the table

I woke up feeling very drugged and dazed. There were nurses struggling to put my underwear and pants back on and suddenly my boyfriend comes out of no where and picks me up and carries me to a bed on the other side of the room. I was half out of it and decided I wanted to get a pad from my purse and put it on

At that point, just imagine the feeling of waking up all happy and loopy in the dentist's chair. Not bad at all. Also, my boyfriend informed me that he had only been waiting a little more than *seven minutes* for the operation to be over. At first I didn't believe the doctor when he said it'd take less than 15 minutes, but it seriously does go that fast.

So a few minutes pass and I can finally stand. Still feeling good. We walk into the hall and find a place for me to sit while my boyfriend goes off and gets all the perscriptions filled. They give us two different antibiotics to prevent infection in the uteris and something called ""motherwart"" in English which supposedly helps ""replenish blood."" Not sure about the effectiveness of the last one

And that's it. So here I am now, despite being slightly panicked and worried throughout the process. I'll give some final important notes/tips for those who are considering getting an abortion done here in China.

1. Bring a Chinese friend. Preferably a female friend that you trust. There wasn't much hard vocabulary I came across except the names of medicines and the description of the operation procedure. But you're going to want someone to give the doctor *clear* instructions about your choice of abortion method and the anesthesia option you want. 

2. Be aware of the time. The first day, you'll need an entire afternoon. For the operation day, you'll need just a little more than an hour, with the actual procedure being less than 10-15 minutes. Get there early on operation day so you don't have to wait long.

3. Bring a lot of money. It wasn't too expensive, perscriptions, tests and various other fees.

4. The testing is way worse than the actual abortion. Seriously, however, was stressful, a little scary, and the internal exam was painful. 

5. You can't have sex for a *month* afterwards. At least that's what the doctors said

6. My final piece of advice, but honest to God it wasn't a bad experience at all. I would much rather do this option than be all nauseous for days and have to bleed out for hours under the supervision of a doctor. Also the success rate is so much higher this way.

So that's it. I sincerely hope my retelling of my experience can help another girl like me who is scared of doing an abortion or similar procedure here in China. I hope someone can find this information valuable and wish you the best of luck. ",,t5_2qh2v,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/China/comments/1ds29v/for_female_expats_looking_for/

So I'm majoring in history and essentially Chinese studies in college.  Multiple Chinese professors/ other Chinese students have made comments that they might have seen as nice, mostly because we connect on academic interests and on an emotional level, but also I admit it might be because of my subconscious interest in both his home country's culture and history.  His mother has said blatantly racist things about me to him and doesn't want me dating him because of both my class and race.  She has told him that I'm only at our college because of affirmative action, asked him how he can find people like me attractive, alluded to the fact that I was aggressive because I'm black.  His father likes me but on multiple occasions has commented on how other black people are lazy, stupid, or destroying America.  This makes me seriously want to reconsider my major, often times my feelings for my Chinese friends.  I have on many occasions experienced colorblind racism from white or even other black friends
TL; DR  I've faced a lot of blatant racism from Chinese people

EDIT:  So the actual racists of Reddit have come out now and this has devolved into me trying to prove something about black people... Sorry if I wasn't clear before as I'm getting some well deserved flak for this.  The Chinese people who I have encountered who acted this way towards me were prejudiced... most likely they were not racists.  My experiences with Chinese people are not accurate reflections of the Chinese populace as a whole so don't take them that way.  Nevertheless other people have had similar experiences with prejudice from Chinese Americans and Chinese people in China, DNA, intelligence, or anything else that is inherent.  We have pretty much concluded that these are learned behaviors... I will list some of the more popular conclusions later tonight.  Thanks for contributing, giving me criticism, advice, and speaking your mind.

EDIT1: If you are interested in sexual life of Chinese here.....Here's my answer:

 1

 2

 3

 4

EDIT2: In my spare time I write novels. Fantasy

EDIT3: Mostly we don't care or try to attend in local politics.What I know about their government is some names of ministers we have to contact with in business and the name of their president. My boss survived a riot in 2005 during the chaos caused by the death of former president. It's very scary according to his description.

EDIT4: About myself. I love reading and wring fantasy and sci-fi. I am a fan of russian culture and literature. And of course I love American culture. The best fantasy and sci-fi is written by amricans. Hope one day I could travel to US.

EDIT5:Something I am planning. Week ago I was suffering from depression. I feel better now but I don't think I would be completely well until I go back to China. But I was bonded by my job here that I can't leave for now until end of this year....I'm not a traveler at all. Perhaps a lot of you foreigner have been to more places in China than I have. So I'm planning to have a trip in China or euriope. I love Serbia and Russia. So Mostly I would travel to these two countries in the winter. Winter in Moscow

EDIT6: An interesting fact. TOGOLAISE PEOPLE and other africans DO wear DOWN JACKETS and COATS !!! Unbelievable

EDIT7: The major public transportation here in Togo and many other african countries is motorbike. Cheap motorbikes are their taxis. Most people take motorbike to move to another place. Thanks to chinese merchants who sell cheap Chinese motorbikes here. A lot of people could afford this cheap vehicles and make a living from it. Though I have to say the Chinese bikes have quite low qualities. Very polluting, high failure rate(which motivate the spare parts market).....

EDIT8: An redditer pointed out my ignorance generalization and prejudice shown in my speech toward African people. I realize I am wrong or generalizing about many things. I'm not going to erase it but if it offended you,False,,t5_2qh2v,1374745734.0,,cn,t3_1invi9

It was a *really* racist protest. Chants of ""日本鬼子""... lots of banners calling for Japan to be flattened, all decked out in Chinese flags and wearing red and stuff. In front of the embassy people were throwing rocks, eggs, and trash at the building. 

There were *hundreds* of police and military there to keep the peace. They weren't interfering, but he didn't mind... I guess I'm lucky because they probably could have arrested me for not having my passport on me. 

Then the cop told me that I had to leave, a group of protestors were walking towards me, eyeing me, and I heard them say something about ""外国人"". With all the anti-foreigner sentiment in the air, I thought it was a good idea to say ""中国加油!"" to them... they laughed, and I went on my merry way.

Edit 2: Going to go see him now

I can take a bunch of questions here

Here's some background about him:

He was born in 1928 in [叶县

After the Japanese surrendered, he went to 开封 in 1948 to try and apply for college again. However, the Communists surrounded and then captured 开封. After this happened, he decided to join the Communist Party. 

After the civil war ended in 1949

He was purged and removed from this post in 1963 during the [Cultural Revolution](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_revolution). He was then put in charge of managing the [上山下乡运动](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Down_to_the_Countryside_Movement) for 长沙.  

After the Cultural Revolution, so he ended up travelling a lot during this time. He officially retired in 1993.

Here are some other anecdotes/stories he's told me about:

During the 1942-43 famine

He said the early late 1930s and early 1940s Henan had the ""Four Big Disasters"" (四大灾害): 水, 汤. 水 is the [1938 Yellow River Flood](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1938_Yellow_River_flood). 旱 and 蝗 references the famines of 1942-43 and 汤 references [汤恩伯](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tang_Enbo) who was the commander of military forces in 河南. He said that the military didn't do anything to help out with the famine and as soon as the Japanese showed up, the Nationalist forces all ran away.  

At the time, there wasn't a lot of brick production, so they would steal the bricks from the burial mounds to take to build the military academy.

He puts a lot of blame of the [Great Leap Forward](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_leap_forward) on the Communist Party. When peasants were ordered to make steel and iron in their backyards

In the 1960s, and 1/4 斤of meat per month. One 斤 is a little more than one pound. The yearly ration of cloth was 2.5尺. My grandmother worked at a market, and when fruits and vegetables started to spoil, they would have to cut off the spoiled parts and continue to sell the good parts. She would buy the spoiled parts of the food for a lot less than the unspoiled parts to take home to have more food. 

Additionally, the entire office only had one telephone. He didn't buy a telephone himself until the 1980s when he was with the bus company. He said he was the first person at his work to buy a telephone. He said the ration coupons stopped sometime around 1990.

He has some resentment towards the Communist Party because of the Great Leap Forward and his purging during the Cultural Revolution. I think he feels that if he wasn't purged

So that’s the story of my granddad. If you have anything you want to ask him

TLDR; My granddad lived through tough times in China

My students are very unsure and very shy and don't want to be rude and I would say most students here are the same when it comes to interacting with foreigners

If you are religious, but don't push it on shy, insecure students who don't know how to tell you to piss off when you're being a pushy ass. You are making us all look bad.

If you are religious and don't push it, just at the fanatics who come to China to learn and decide it should be their right to push religion down other people's throats all around the world.

I'm from the States and we have our fair share of assholes, throwing popcorn at the screen. I've walked through Manhattan a dozen times where people bump into me and try to pick a fight.  In DC at night, I've seen fights break out over nothing and bottles being thrown around. Or in the Wal-Marts where people wear less than their pajamas to shop for food and double park cause they're lazy. When my service is poor at a restaurant in Seattle, I don't criticize the entire society for the server bringing my food an hour after I ordered it. When any of these problems occur at home I don't for a second think ""wow Americans are assholes"" or ""America is uncivilized.""  Why should I think differently here?

Yes

What I'm trying to say is, there are times where something major happens and fucks up my entire day but those things can happen to me back at home. It's really easy to become disillusioned here in China and develop an us vs them mentality.  When you start seeing common everyday problems as China problems, you're only going to become more angry and disillusioned. Don't let other disillusioned expats bring you down to their level.




Edit: Uhh


**Edit 2**: Wow

I also realize part of the reason I have so many opportunities is precisely because China is a developing country with all sorts of serious issues. Pollution, driving the rate and demand for our services we provide lower. It's precisely because there are so many problems here that we are able to succeed and thrive here.

When you get your feet on the ground here, go to a bar and talk to other teachers to see where's hiring, check the local classifieds, guaranteed.

2.  EF, mostly to weed out the backpackers who won't take the job seriously at all.  I like to recommend getting a TEFL certificate, mostly for the same reason, but the fact of the matter is that for most schools a TEFL is pretty unnecessary.  Just remember, people are dropping a half month's salary to take your class, so *please* for the love of the industry don't be a dick and goof around.  It reflects badly on education and foreigners in general.

**What can I expect to get paid in China?**

1.  For education,000 per month for full time and RMB200 per hour for part time.  I know that in other parts of China the pay is usually less, sometimes dramatically.  Hopefully other people can chime in with different cities.

2.  Outside of education,000 is a good salary for someone under the age of 30 in China, so there always reaches a point where it makes more sense to hire a local over a foreigner.  That said, for the most part I've always stuck around in education (although I have friends in other industries), so if anyone has anymore information on that front I'm sure it'd be useful.

**I want to get rich in China.  I'm white

1.  The media, or sea turtles), who have spent time studying and/or working abroad and are coming back to China.  They know English, they know how things work in the West, and they know *Chinese*.  Fluently.  Not this bullshit ""I can stutter and mutter for a couple hours to a girl at a bar"", but a native with an actual mastery of the language.  What real advantages do you have over such a person, besides being a white dude? (*hint*: people have companies to run.  Being white matters a lot less than many think it does)  

2.  China, locals can get rich here, but it's largely from either proximity to the government-sponsored-fixed-asset-bubble-corruption machine, or from luck.

3.  So how can a foreigner make good money?  First off, plus some.  If that's you, congrats, but you're likely someone with experience who's developed well in a company back in the States, not a young guy looking to develop in China.  Also, from what I've heard, these packages are drying up as companies are increasingly turning to local talent that can actually... get things done in China.

4.  Secondly, or perhaps a restaurant/bar, as those are the industries that most foreigners have experience in.  Now, note that owning a company is never easy, requires your blood, sweat, and tears, China has one enormous advantage over the United States - seeing as the financial system is so crazily fucked up (making the bubbly real estate market or a bank account the only investment opportunities for wealthy locals)

**Ok

1.  Yep, if you stay in China, the choices aren't necessarily phenomenal.  

2.  Firstly, and you should be able to find something entry-level.  Yet be warned: the pay isn't necessarily better than education.

3.  Secondly, you need to *actually* know Chinese (could you read a report in Chinese with minimal frustrations?  Could you participate in a meeting in Chinese?  Could write a tactfully worded email in Chinese?).  If you are actually proficient in Chinese (here's a test: write a cover letter for a job, in Chinese, with no help from the internet or Chinese friends. Then show it to a friend or teacher. How many mistakes did you make?), it's incredibly easy to find a job as a foreigner on 51job or whathaveyou. Companies are sifting through piles of resumes, they get one from a foreigner - they're likely going to call you in for an interview. But be warned: the money isn't necessarily better than teaching.

**Christ

I know what this might sound like.  But as many Chinese people are quick to note

Now, hospitable people, and a comfortable standard of living for foreigners.  Explore the world, live abroad - it'll open your eyes and your mind.

about the different phone company and SIM card options available in China

**EDIT** This was not meant to include every single possible phone plan or option available in China. I work for a U.S. mobile phone company, I simply listed a comparison of the most common ones, yes, other options for plans are available, but the ones listed should suit the vast majority of people. Thanks :)

First off
largest:

**China Mobile, village, and backwater
market anywhere in China.

**Coverage**: Basically everywhere/anywhere.

**Network**: 

* 2G GSM Service compatible with any quad-band unlocked phone. 
* 3G service is based on a Chinese-made TD-SCDMA standard

**China Unicom

**Coverage**: Unicom has a bit of a bad rap with locals as far as coverage goes
seems to be based on old experiences/loyalty to China Mobile. The bad coverage is no longer the case. 3G coverage now
covers more than 90% of the Chinese population
go anywhere that you don't have coverage.

**Network**: 

* 2G GSM Service compatible with any quad-band unlocked phone.
* 3G UMTS compatible with any unlocked phone that supports 2100mhz 3G
smartphones. HSPA+ 21.1 service recently launched in most major cities
requires any 2100mhz smartphone. 

**China Telecom
which is incompatible with most if not all phones purchased outside China.

**Coverage**: About the same 2G coverage as Unicom

**Network**: China Telecom is using variant of North American CDMA technology that adds a SIM
card to the standard. As such
that have been specifcally designed for the standard
in China. 

**Coverage TLDR**; For absolute best coverage
go with China Mobile. 

For great coverage with 3G service covering 90% of China's population
go with China Unicom. (personal recommendation)

If you feel like purchasing a phone that will only be useful in China
China Telecom. Read: No reason to.



**Now

**China Mobile**: Basic SIM is a 50RMB prepaid SIM card. 

If used in the same city where purchased
for long distance. All incoming call free. 

If used outside of the city of purchase
and 0.39 RMB/minute for incoming calls.

To buy: Any China Mobile/mobile phone shop. Write down ""50RMB SIM""
you are talking about. 


**China Unicom**: Basic 3G Voice/Data SIM
where you are or where you are calling in China.

66RMB/month buys you 50 minutes of outgoing calls
Incoming calls and SMS are free.

Additional outgoing calls are 0.2 RMB/minute anywhere in China. 

Additional data is billed at .3 RMB/MB
balance you have loaded onto the SIM card. 

To buy: Any China Unicom shop
If you go to an official China Unicom store
point to the brochure where it lists ""3G Plan A

**China Telecom**: Don't know
specifically designed for the standard

**TLDR**; China Unicom is generally cheaper
Hopefully this helps!",,t5_2qh2v,1355023586.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/China/comments/101lnp/your_complete_guide_to_chinese_sim_cards_and/

Around 9pm she arrives at my room still dressed in her waitress uniform and I am thinking this could be my first real porno experience. “Room Service” “Maid in China” “I’m Here to Collect your Laundry” . I digress. We get to chatting for about half an hour and she tells me she wants to marry an Englishman. I’m thinking hold on there pet I don’t even know your name. She tells me her name. I still don’t know it. 

She gets a phone call and says she has to go out with her friends drinking so I think none of it and say goodbye. I was fucking knackered so I went to bed (had a wank). 


Around 1am she turns up at my hotel room again, shoulder to cry on and all that, good job I had that wank.  


From this point on she would only communicate in writing via the hotel room notepad. Thusly, if only through fear of getting murdered or ripped off. I said no it’s ok, I don’t need to sleep (one eye open, drool stringing down my chin), why don’t we just have a chat. Still hoping for a shag like.

* Seller points to a sign behind him with prices listed like 5 yuan, cheap prices.
* I tell him I want these dumplings and he puts a sauce or whatever on them and hands them to me.
* I hand over 20 yuan.
* Seller tells me the price is 50 yuan. Obviously this is bullshit so a mini argument begins.
* During the argument people who clearly work for stall/market start buying the exact thing I ordered (but don't get a topping so the food can be reused) and do a terrible acting job to make sure I see them paying 50 yuan and that 50 yuan is the normal price.
* Seller gets very aggressive. I speak a bit of Chinese, but I would imagine most tourists would be intimidated into paying the 50 yuan.

Of course, they insisted to give us two large bottles, not just one, and refused payment.

In 1943 during the continuing conflict with Japan in WWII, President Chiang Kai-shek) issued the [Cairo Declaration](http://www.ndl.go.jp/constitution/e/shiryo/01/002_46/002_46tx.html) which basically stated that the three allies agreed to stop Japanese aggression and that all lands taken by Japan from China during the war, would be returned to China.

Following the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and China defined that ""Japanese sovereignty shall be limited to the islands of Honshu, Hokkaido, Kyushu, Shikoku and such minor islands as we determine."". Pretty vague with what appears to be a cya disclaimer at the end. 

Later, in Article 3, appears to give the US the authority to administer the area that the Diaoyu are located.

China would also enter in a peace treaty with Japan a year later

Just putting those out there for people who might be interested in learning more about this. What follows are my own opinions and questions.

The U.S. clearly agreed that all territories taken by Japan during WWII would be returned to China and if the Diaoyu were indeed China's prior to WWII, in which it would control any territory that previously belonged to China. So from my perspective, it's quite simple. Under whose sovereignty was the Diaoyu prior to WWII and here is where it gets tricky.

From what I gather both cultures identify the islands on their maps going back hundreds of years

The Japanese government annexed the islands in 1895. Is there any formal denouncement or contention made from China? From 1900 to 1940 a Japanese fishing company operated a processing facility there with 200 workers. If this was Chinese territory

Going back to Potsdam. Did the allies ever ""determine"" that the Diaoyu were among those ""minor islands"" to be part of Japanese sovereignty? If not

Confusing and would appreciate any further insight with supporting links/documentation instead of just opinion. On the one hand I can see Japan making a claim that it was not a territory taken by force during the War and as such they have no reason to relinquish it per the declarations. On the other hand, when they previously agreed to define Japanese sovereignty with China and it did not include the Diaoyu. What a friggin mess.",,False,,t5_2qh2v,False,kr,

1327000020.0,onn4d,Overseas Born Chinese and some petty struggles,mchengl,67,11,115,"Hey

I'm an Australian born Chinese

I have previously been to China numerous times throughout my life

Double standards is a thing I'm beginning to cope with. Firstly would be language. My Mandarin is fluent, but it turns out being overseas Chinese entitles you to a life of purgatory here. If I was to make one single grammatical mistake or spelling error using Chinese, something simple that even locals get wrong, they will rib it on me for days. Hm, well that's a double standard for locals and me I guess, another problem is probably my own jealousy. My laowai friends speak completely broken Chinese and they love him for it. I'm usually fine with that, Chinese is a hard language.

Pay and employment, I've been working as a translator and English Teacher around Beijing. Living on the usual 3000-4000 a local Chinese earns. I see similar unqualified people from Europe, not even from a English speaking country such as Russia, getting paid 10 000 a month. In fact I was a recruiter for a English company for a while, the interviews made me cringe, here I was interviewing someone for a position that is better than mine, when I am the one more suited for it. Most of these non-English foreign expats can speak English but not well enough to have a good conversation or write an essay. After a dozen of these, the parents want someone that is white. This just keeps drumming in my head

I posted a while ago on here, like a guy who thinks he is better than everyone because he is of another nationality now. I know why, many Chinese leave the country and get foreign nationalities and come back proud. Except, I've never done anything proud. I tell everyone I'm a Huaren and I have read the classic Chinese texts, know my dynasties off by heart, studied countless hours of Chinese history and even go to karaoke and other events mainly locals enjoy. Everywhere I go, if I speak English to a laowai friend, people think I'm stupid. 

A common situation that arises when I teach English is the student I have, how much I explain that in Australian and British English it was different, they just assumed I was lying that I knew English since their previous 'laowai' teacher from Ukraine taught them otherwise. The other thing they always say is ""My REAL laowai teacher told me this, or why do you charge SO much when you are a Chinese second language learner?"" I charge 50-100 a hour...This isn't a matter of being right and wrong, this just causes identity problems within me. What am I? 

I quit my first translation job because i was getting 4000 a month compared to the 5000 another guy was getting. Difference was

Going on, my laowai friends can always pick up on the girl that rejected me. Every single time nearly, perhaps Vics isn't the best place. I must either be the total opposite in terms of a guy to my laowai friends or there's some type if innate racism within these girls. I always try to use Occam's Razor and think of the simplest explanation but once this happens so much, that statistically, the complicated explanation makes more sense, you get a real pain in your chest, knowing that girls from your own ethnicity are not interested in you. 

There are of course

There aren't any McDs or KFCs around here so that's out, and virtually none of the shops or small restaurants have bathrooms (at least not any where customers are allowed into) so what's left if you have a 3 year old dying to go? The truth is, there isn't anything you can do apart from jumping into your car and speeding home, something that's definitely not an option for most Chinese parents.

1354719395.0,14bofc,Responses from my granddad,mkdz,55,7,7,"&gt;My question is: In the film Xi'an was the 'safe haven'

In 1942 he attended昆阳中学 until when he graduated in 1944. Before he could take finals

In March 1945 Japanese invaded Western 河南, the Japanese surrendered, so the school moved back to 安阳. He said he had walked everywhere at this point. In reality, he only had about 2-3 months of school in 1945 because of all the movement.

When he went back to 河南, it’s the site of a museum.

Around March of 1947, and no communication. 

Around June 1947

All the colleges had already found students, they actually invaded the city so he left in June. The Communists retreated in July-August and then the Nationalists came back. He went back to check to see if school would start up again in August, but he couldn’t find anything. He met an elementary school friend while walking on the street and they decided they would go to 南京 to go to another school opened by Nationalists.

&gt;Can you find out what his feelings were

&gt;Was there ever any ideological basis for your grandfather's joining the Party?

In early 1949

When they got back to河南, and the other six went to 开封 to find a school. They found a 中原大学 in 开封, but they didn’t think it was good enough. They also found that in 徐州 to the east of Kaifeng there was a school that would offer an associate degree. They decided that this was better than nothing so they wanted to go there. Before they went to徐州, they went to the education department in开封 to talk to an old teacher of theirs that ended up being the head of the education department. He said to not to go to the school offering the associate degree. The Communist Party needed people to work for the government and 中原大学 was the best choice for that. So they decided to enroll and started on March 12. He said he was there for six months and all he learned about was Communist ideology. He said he took everything with a grain of salt, and just wrote what the teachers wanted to hear so he could graduate and get a job. He said there were two things they learned none of the students believed: the Nationalists didn’t fight the Japanese and the Japanese surrendered because of Communists fighting for 8 years not because of atomic bombs or Soviets. 

&gt;How did he end up in the Mayor position

After he graduated from this “college”, he was not vice-mayor or mayor of the city. He was vice-mayor and mayor of a district in the city. 长沙 at the time had something like eight districts. He was appointed to his position by the Communist party head of长沙. He said at the time, there wasn’t a whole lot of corruption or power plays compared to now and they would crack down on it pretty hard. He said he remembered the 天津 mayor got executed because of corruption. 

&gt;My question is, and if he was happy to sit back and take pay checks from the state coffers to do nothing, is there any chance that he was part of the problem, not part of the solution, and would he still feel resentful if he was on the gravy train right now, or would he be happy to ride it all the way?
Does he ever feel guilty about his part in all of the above?

&gt;What was it like to be a vice-major during the Cultural revolution? I mean was he scared during that time? And what was the '' purging '' like? Just an order from Beijing or more like a violent replacement?

He was mayor in the city so he never oversaw any farms. At the time

In the late 50s

At the time, he was good friends with a doctor and had him write notes that said he was too sick to work so that every few months he could come back to 长沙for a couple months at a time.

If he wasn’t purged

&gt;According to western history books

He said that the GLF was worse overall for the country than the famine. He said in WWII, but if you were outside those areas, you were ok. In the GLF, everybody was suffering.

&gt;Was wondering what type of impact does he feel the famine in Henan and The Great Leap Forward had on the mentality of the Chinese people. Does he feel the famines may have played a role in the money obsessed mentality associated with modern Chinese?

&gt;Was wondering

&gt; Can you ask him what long-term impact the famine period and the GLF had on his personality and his general outlook on life? Also you mention that he feels disdain towards the CCP relating to the rampant corruption that exists. With his insider knowledge it would therefore be interesting to hear his opinion on how corruption will hold back future political reform in China. Thanks for this opportunity.

He said the GLF and the Cultural Revolution created a big distrust of the government and party. The government would say things, there were around 300 people and only about ten of them received higher than an elementary school education.

He thinks corruption is the biggest issue facing China and if there was more than one party

On our way home we approached two ""students"" asking a russian girl to go to a tea house with them. I know the language a little bit

We walked away, the chinese guys saw that and realized I wasn't telling the truth.

They ran towards us and pushed me from behind. One of them screamed at me cholericly

They continued to push me and screaming that it's none of my business. I didn't swallow this and pushed back

I told the girl to leave and that we are going to do the same, obviously not understanding what was going on.
They said that I will not leave and that I'm in big trouble now. After a phonecall from one of those guys a few more of their friends showed up and surrounded me.
My friend tried to intervene

In the end I was surrounded by 6 guys and one of them pulled a knife out. At first they wanted money and tried to put their hands in my pockets. I pushed them away and just said that I don't have money anyways and that my cellphone is pretty crappy too.
The guy who pushed me at first said he didn't even want my money
I managed to squeeze out of the ring of thugs and started walking away with my friend. They continued to run behind us kicking me

Oh and yes, walking towards her hotel, I guess.

Chad knew they were trying to push him out but remained firm until earlier in the week they accused him of stealing money and effectively pushed he and his wife out of the business.

 Though I did something every stupid to screw everything up. 

But from my sad and short romance I found American girls have a fasinating and independent personality which attracts me very much. I don't mean I've made up my mind to find an American wife and I probably don't have a chance to know an American girl in my real life.  But somehow look forward it. However I am a little nervous and unconfident about myself. I want to know if I had chance to improve myself into someone who would attract an American girl which direction should I go?

What I would like to know is what you expect from a boyfriend or husband. 

EDIT: I forgot to ask one important thing. How and where could I get to know an American girl? Moving to USA is a way....But I don't feel like to move there. So how and where could I get to know an American girl in China? I had never and probably will never go to a bar or club or something....I am already out of school and college. 

Thank you all.

Appearance? Body fitness? Personality? Please tell me. Thanks very much....

Oh please tell what I should avoid if I would like to date an American girl. I always goes the wrong way in relationship I guess...

EDIT:thank for all the advice you kind people offered. Thank you all...... Though I think I am just into some obsession into some particular group of females. Thank you all..And hope you happy lives.

To be fair, thought I did the same about Natives like all Objibwe folks back home had teepees and smoking pipes.  Anyhoo, there was once when my Chinese roommate fucking pissed the shit out of me... something annoyingly irritable.  The guy would bring his gf over and literally have sex with her with the door open and she'd make sheep-like bleats and shrieks... and being the nice guy that I am, I would close my door and act as if it didn't happen.  You know, common sense.  I had hoped they noticed they let the door open and feel all salty, I was ripe with revenge and used his stereotypes of Miao people against him.  I poured table salt in a line outside his door and made knots out of toilet paper and hung it on his door knob.  Then I arranged this impromptu altar on the kitchen table, there is a spirit following her.  It likes to stand over her when shes eating and I notice it stands between you two.

http://www.engadget.com/2012/07/20/lenovo-ceo-spreads-the-wealth/

By Terrence O'Brien

The list of CEOs and other execs in the US that have accepted multi-million dollar bonuses for lording over the crash and burn of a company (or even an entire economy) is staggering. And we can guarantee you that most of that money went towards fancy cars and golden toilet seats. Lenovo's Yang Yuanqing,000 discrete chunks and dispersed to line workers, assistants and other lower-level employees. I think that officially makes Yang Yuanqing our new favorite CEO in tech.

Edit: The skeptic in me wanted to check this guy out some more to see if this was some kind of publicity stunt or if he was the type of guy that would do this sincerely.

Has the SCMP released any documentary evidence or technical details about these hacks? I'm curious as to what exactly is claimed to have taken place. The only thing I could see in the story is:

&gt; It is not known how many times the prestigious university has been attacked by the NSA but details shown to the Post by Snowden reveal that one of the most recent breaches was this January.

&gt; The information also showed that the attacks on Tsinghua University were intensive and concerted efforts. In one single day of January

&gt; Snowden said the information he shared on the Tsinghua University attacks provided evidence of NSA hacking because the specific details of external and internal internet protocol addresses could only have been obtained by hacking or with physical access to the computers.",,t5_2qh2v,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/China/comments/1gv27s/scmp_nsa_targeted_chinas_tsinghua_university_in/

Do anyone here know of some good documentaries set in china they would recomend? Preferably from a Chinese or foreigners point of view (**stories about people** as oposed to events, but anything you like is fine. I really liked:

* [**BBCs Chinese Schools**](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=yGVwpLNKLWg)
*  [**The Last Train Home**](http://www.pbs.org/pov/lasttrainhome/#.UUpuhx37Luc)
* [**Please Vote For Me**](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1097256/)
* [**Up the Yangtze**](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1114277/)

I am fluent in Japanese and I started picking up Mandarin last semester. I have also been active in couchsurfing.org for a few years and have hosted nearly 100 people from around the world. Last semester I shared a room with a Chinese girl (let's call her X) in my dorm and we became close friends... or so I thought.

X and I wanted to continue living together so we found an apartment with her friend and their current roommate. I am the only one with US citizenship, and teach English, which is what I want to do after I graduate.

I had too high of hopes.

X no longer speaks with me. She doesn't even want me to help her with her English homework. Her English abilities have atrophied

My roommates spend hours having a good time in one room eating snacks and watching programs. They have never invited me to join them. They don't seem to like it when I bring snacks to them and try to talk to them. They don't like entering my room. I just sit alone

I've recently learned they don't want to know English and that they paid people to write their college applications. I also learned this weekend that two of them left for Las Vegas without even telling me let alone saying goodbye. They don't say hello to me. They don't even answer me when I tell them I'm leaving and I'll see them later.

**tl;dr: I'm being ostracized by the Chinese people I'm living with. I'm desperate to figure out how to interact with them and why they dislike me so much.**

EDIT: Why yes

UPDATE: Thanks to all of your help

UPDATE: Finally, made lots of excuses as to why she couldn't talk to me. But... We finally had a discussion and I'm here to let you know what's become of us.

First I talked to the landlady since she stopped by while I was waiting for X and Y to come home. I asked her about the lease and to my surprise, but I was under the impression that they had no way of being on the lease here... However, they can leave after they find a replacement. They don't want to do that though.

When everyone got together, had to restrain her. She really doesn't want anything to do with me. Y and X (my roommate from last semester whom I was really good friends with) were wearing matching $300 Juicy Couture outfits. To which I commented on: wow, Y has really turned you into a different person. Maybe you should give me back that friendship bracelet and the gift I made for you when we were living together. She promptly brought both of these things back as if she were bringing me a pencil to write a grocery list. This hit me really hard. She has changed. Or maybe she's just more of who she wanted to be before. Now she's just somebody that I used to know. *breaks into song to lighten the mood*

Y explained to me that she never wanted to live with me. She doesn't like Americans. She doesn't want to be around me because I don't have a 100% Chinese cultural identity. Yeah

J really feels for me here. X has abandoned me, leaving me completely isolated in this house.

Neither Y nor X want to move. They will stay here. We will share the same common space. We will live separate lives. This will continue until July (or May if they move back to China for the summer). May I gain and keep wu wei during these months...

The girls in our group got really angry and they were yelling at each other when the man ran across the table and punched our friend in her face.

1343572586.0,xcc4q,The Chinese Diet,jimfields,48,7,70,"Before starting my rant (with occasional questions for discussion) I'll just say that I've lived here for a few years

I realize generalizations are difficult (and dangerous, nutritious diet. This comes in contrast to my Western friends (some who are unhealthy/fat), but, if pressed, could at least come up with a reasonable list to delineate what foods are healthy and what foods are not.

Despite claims about the heat-alleviating benefits of fruit, pastries) make up most of my friends diets, along with preservative-laced milk teas, instant food, and all manner of other preserved junk. There are also massive quantities of salt (and MSG, of course) in virtually all of the dishes. 

Of course, but obesity is rising in many areas, and I feel like the level of general health I see is in many cases is extremely low - people are thin, certainly, but even taking stairs or sprinting across a street will completely exhaust many of my friends (cigarettes might be a factor in that as well).

Anyway, as it were. I'm convinced that the reason this is such a common topic of discussion is simply because of the stuff people put into their bodies - of course your digestive tract will go into revolt! If there's someone with a medical/digestive scientific background I would appreciate some insight on this (obviously unsanitary food practices and food safety scandals/ fake food play a role as well).

The other odd thing about my impressions regarding food is that - it's almost a cliché to say - this is a culture completely obsessed with food in many ways. The preparation of  food

So - can someone help me unravel the paradoxes of this uniquely Chinese perspective on nutrition? I realize it's a big question,False,,t5_2qh2v,False,,,t3_xcc4q

**Story1**, I don't know. It's hard for me to tell the difference from Arabs and Whites. To my personal view I thought them very pretty and cute though always dirty on their faces.--Ok, DON'T LOOK AT ME WITH THAT FACE, I'M NOT A PEDOROSIS Freak, my appreciation of their beauty had nothing related with sexual desire. I was curious about them and asked our local driver. He said maybe they were abandoned bastard daughters of some white man(prick). Some Chinese told me they are refugees of Afghanistan or Libya. I gave them some money several times.

Then one day I found them disappeared. I haven't seen them anymore. I mentioned them one time when chatting other Chinese online and one told me in a tone of joking: ""Maybe they were sold to some rich black or white. Their virginity is much more expensive than black girls."" I was disgusted by his speech and shocked of his speculating. And that reminded me I was in an poor african country. I mean even though Lome is somehow an big international city and this kind of tragedy even happened in my own country so why would I be shocked? What am I expecting? A happy fairy tale ending? 

And I felt ashamed of myself when I realized I cared about them only because they are pretty little girls and  not locals like many other children beggars on the streets. Was there ONE TIME I care about other black children beggars? Maybe one or two times when I noticed them rather than losing into my own thoughts while driving by. Even my Messiah complex was so picky. And that's when I truly and fully understand the famous quote from our 《道德经》: A real saint show no mercy or sympathy to anyone or anything. The sky and the earth show no preference to anyone or anything.""(天地不仁，以万物为刍狗；圣人不仁以万物为刍狗。）


**Story2**: ""Chinese Dream"". Our driver whose name is Samuel once asked me questions like:""Is it true that you Chinese don't need to pay money for hospital?""or""Is it true that your government will give you free houses?""or""Is it true that education in China is for free?"" I answered ""no

I fully understand their fault images and expectation of China. We had similar ones about USA back to 10~20 years ago. Watch the famous TV series ""Beijinger In New York"". I never thought there would be one day when China would be destinations and homes for foreign immigrants. I was growing up with being told that everything was better in 外国. This 外国 can be USA, France, Germany, Japan, South Korea, or Sierra Leone, Nigeria, Congo... And when I was grown up and know better about foreign countries I found that they are not so good. This kind of feelings grows into overconfidence and extremely nationalism for some people. Some people refuse to believe that and insist their inferior complex about their own country. And some people (young generations) like me just go between them. Inferior? No more. Confident? Yes

I read news about the black communities AKA ""Chocolate City"" in Guangzhou and the riot after a Nigerian illegal immigrant's death when he was chasing by local police. If lives in China were really that good like Samuel's brother's description then this riot would not happened. 

Samuel's Chinese dream would continue for a long time I guess. Maybe someday he would get to chance to go to China by legal or illegal ways. What are the Africans lives like in China? What are they thinking about? Are they planning to settle down permanently?  I don't know. No one knows and few care. 

**Story3** :Politics. I mentioned in my AMA that most Chinese including me are not interested in local politics. But more or less we have to be affected by it. For example

In 2010~2011, the opposition party organized a series of demonstrations before and after the election. This is democracy.Although I don't really believe in multiple-party democracy, I have nothing against Togolaise people to realize it until I was struck in the streets several times when it's occupied by the demonstrating people. Hmmmmm....Maybe I was too selfish, after all they were fighting for their own rights( But I doubted most rights-fighters were just paid by the opposition party). 

Then in April 2011 the peaceful demonstration turned into something violent. The angry youth(like those in China) began to use violence to ""express"" their demand. They began to smash the foreigner shops( most are Chinese owned) and facilities. Unfortunately our new location was on the main road to Lome Airport on which there is a Korean Wig factory which employed hundreds of local workers and became the main target of those unemployed angry young men. On that day we didn't close our garage because we didn't expect it goes so far. When we heard the crowd it was too late to flee. So we close our doors and hide inside. I missed wholes situation because I was too scared to go outside to see what's happening. Luckily we weren't their target and were rarely influenced. But it's not so lucky for the Wig factory. When we finally got our chance to leave I saw broken doors and blooding people. Days after

And then the opposition party used some other ways to express their ""legal"" demand like organizing a ""WOMEN EXPRESS THEIR SUPPORT FOR CONSTITUTION AND OPPOSITION PARTY BY REFUSING HAVING SEX WITH THEIR HUSBANDS"" movement....You can google it....

My experience of their politics is scary but far from dangerous. However what my boss told me about his horrible adventure in 2005 was a completely different story. 

In 2005

My boss and his wife and cousin were there and were not planning to escape for the hope of better situation. However their scariest nightmare came one night. Mobs from Ghana came through the borderline to ""join the party of riots"". On that night

**STORY 4** The spoon. I had to go to our garage early this morning and when my errand's done I decided to walk home because the air in the morning after whole night's rain is (this story happened only 30 minutes ago) so fresh and cool and our mansion is only ten minutes walk from home. The street was almost empty. Most men were gone to polling station and those who stayed were mostly women and children. 

I felt hungry when I passed by a food stand. These food stands, macaroni, eggs, beans and sauce can be found in every corner of every street in Lome. Most people buy food in the day instead of cooking at home-I've been to a poor local's home, and found their homes are somehow like 四合院 in Beijing, a big yard live four of five families, share the same public space. They don't have a kitchen but cook their food outdoor in the yard with rock-made oven and big iron pot. 

I bought some food including the rice. Though had food in these food stands for thousand times I never tried their rice. I came from the ""Home of Rice"" in China and am very picky with rices. But this time I decided to try it.After giving me the food I commend the salesgirl turned to other guests who were staring at the white(yes we Chinese are also white in their eyes) man buying their food. She forgot something- the spoon. I tried to find one on the desk but didn't find it. It wasn't a negligence for her because most Africans eat their food with their fingers. So I asked her to give me one spoon and she said:y'a pas. C'est finis. (no spoons

I was wondering if I should try my fingers or just give the food to someone and leave

Then I remembered my knowledge of biology. Very few pathogenic bacteria could survive in the air after leaving human body. Using this spoon she haven't used would not get me infected with communicable disease. So I thanked her again and finished my food with it.

I'm an american born chinese gal in her twentysomethings, with a great circle of friends and a really awesome dog. Things were going gravy, and I started sharing an apt with a friend. I was finally out on my own, and out of my parents house! Things started going downhill very quickly from there. 

Mind you, Chinese parents. They had already disapproved of me working at a bar, but me leaving the house seemed to be too much for them (I believe they want me to be married with a solid career before I go off living on my own). I had also made it clear to them I had no intention of moving with them to China (which they plan to do within the next few years), and that I'm fully capable of being on my own in the country I was born and raised in. They didn't expressly fight me on this, which in hindsight, should have alarmed me. For years, they've wanted me to at least visit China - but I never had the time due to the constraints of school/work. This year though, and see things from a different perspective- And

As you may have guessed by now, where we've been staying. They also enrolled me in a TEFL course, and are adamant that I'll have a perfect future and career as an english teacher in China. The problem is, it's THEIR perfect little future for me, and they set it up without caring or asking what I WANT. They have straight up said they don't want me to go back to the States, and that if I want to, I'll have to find my own way back. 

What can I do but to walk this road now that they've so haphazardly thrown together? I have no savings, but not a lick of mandarin. I feel so strange and alien, walking around not even knowing what the shop signs say, or read a menu, or tell the difference between the shampoo and conditioner in a store. I feel like an awkward, mentally challenged local, since I look just like them

Also, but that sounds just *kinda* risky and reckless. Unless one of you has a brilliant idea that could prove otherwise...

Any other foreign born chinese in China that can share their experiences (in China and/or as an English Teacher)? Or anyone that can give me some advice, and I'll be alone in this strange foreign world with no friends, job, or any idea what I'm doing.

* I can't count how many cafes and shops I've been to that only have two or three songs on loop. 

* But then there's also the people with bullhorns riding their scooters around town selling stuff with the same shouting message on a 2-3 second loop

* At the bank

* Even a taxi ride last night


What is it that allows people to tune out what otherwise is maddening repetition?

We all wish the best of luck to the author of [a certain post on this thread related to this subject](http://www.reddit.com/r/China/comments/17petc/chinese_bf_update_day_42/), there needs to be some sort of way to compensate for this treatment.

First, and adapt the culture.  Similarly, the host country should welcome outsiders dedicated to assimilating.  This is not the case in China.

Second

* Let's say an English tutor costs ¥100 per hour.
* Assume a married couple will probably spend five hours a day talking to each other (starting at 17:00 after work and then end at 22:00 when they fall asleep).
* There are an average of 30.4 days in a month
* Renminbi deposits currently yield 3.25% per year.

Everyone knows the medium of exchange in China for marriages is a house.  The key here is to discount the present value of the total estimated free tutoring time over the span of the marriage

Assume the marriage lasts fifty years (from age 25 until you die at 75).  That house needs to be equal or greater than ¥4.5 million

A divorce makes it trickier.  If you split the value of the house in half at the time of divorce, or ¥1 million after the divorce.  The present value of your tutoring at six years is ¥993,089, so six years is the cut-off point for your marriage.  Otherwise you are losing money.

Here is the Excel equation if anyone would like to do their own calculations:

    =PV(3.25%/12

**EXTRA CONSIDERATION:**  Most countries offer permanent residency to foreign spouses of nationals.  China does not reciprocate.  In the case of Americans,000.  If the purpose of the marriage is improving English *and* emigrating from China, an extra sum should be added, either as a larger house or in cash.",,False,,False,t3_17qv4m

He justified this by reminding us that employees in another city's office already do this.  As if that makes it okay.

Furthermore, highly offensive?  If I were a Chinese employee and my white CEO told me that my country's food is so stinky, it's unfit for office consumption, while a steaming hunk of beef is totally fine, I'd explode.  I'm close to exploding as is.

(you have to create a account to read the article




Here's how it would happen. Children playing along an urban river bank would spot hundreds of grotesque, their rotting bodies collecting by the thousands along river banks. And three unrelated individuals would stagger into three different hospitals, gasping for air. Two would quickly die of severe pneumonia and the third would lay in critical condition in an intensive care unit for many days. Government officials would announce that a previously unknown virus had sickened three people, at least, and killed two of them. And while the world was left to wonder how the pigs, ducks, swans, the World Health Organization would release deliberately terse statements

It reads like a movie plot -- I should know, indeed, be unrelated, and the new virus, a form of influenza denoted as H7N9, may have already run its course, infecting just three people and killing two.

Or this could be how pandemics begin.

On March 10, noticed some dead pigs floating among garbage flotsam in the city's Huangpu River. The vile carcasses appeared in Shanghai's most important tributary of the mighty Yangtze, a 71-mile river that is edged by the Bund, the city's main tourist area, and serves as the primary source of drinking water and ferry travel for the 23 million residents of the metropolis and its millions of visitors. The vision of a few dead pigs on the surface of the Huangpu was every bit as jarring for local Chinese as porcine carcasses would be for French strolling the Seine, Londoners along the Thames, or New Yorkers looking from the Brooklyn Bridge down on the East River.

And the nightmarish sight soon worsened,000 dead animals. The river zigzags its way from Zhejiang province, just to the south of Shanghai, a farming region inhabited by some 54 million people, and a major pork-raising district of China. Due to scandals over recent years in the pork industry, including substitution of rendered pig intestines for a toxic chemical, sold as heparin blood thinner that proved lethal to American cardiac patients, and terrified farmers admitted that they had dumped the dead animals into the Huangpu.

Few Chinese asked, and are responsible for all such mysterious animals demises. The Yangtze, which feeds Shanghai's Huangpu, has copper pollution levels that are 100 times higher than U.S. safety standards, and leather tanning facilities along the river have notoriously been responsible for toxic waste, including chromium. And across China -- especially in Beijing -- air pollution was so bad in January and February that pollution particulate levels routinely peaked at higher than 10 times the U.S. safety standards set by the Environmental Protection Agency. When I was in Beijing in late January, the air pollution was so thick that it visually looked like fog, hideous as the pig carcasses might be

But 12 days after the first Shanghai porcine death flow was spotted, this one located hundreds of miles west of Shanghai. Known as ""the Sky City"" for its 2,749-foot-tall central tower, Changsha is home to more than 7 million people and capital of Hunan province. Along with some 50 dead pigs, authorities collected a few thousand dead ducks from the Xiang on March 22 and 23.

Two days later, near Lake Qinghai. The lake is the most important transit and nesting site for migratory aquatic birds that travel the vast Asia flyway, stretching from central Siberia to southern Indonesia. In 2005, a mass die-off of aquatic birds in and around Lake Qinghai resulted from a mutational change in the long-circulating bird flu virus, H5N1 -- a genetic shift that gave that virus a far larger species range, allowing H5N1 to spread for the first time across Russia, Ukraine and into Europe

On March 25,000 pig carcasses and tens of thousands of ducks and swans had washed upon riverbanks that stretch from the Lake Qinghai area all the way to the East China Sea -- a distance roughly equivalent to the span between Miami and Boston. Nobody knows how many more thousands of birds and pigs have died, but gone uncounted as farmers buried or burned the carcasses to avoid reprimands from authorities.

While environmental clean-up and agricultural authorities scrambled to remove the unsightly corpses and provide the anxious public with less-than-believable explanations for their demise, China's state news agency, only as Li, an 87-year old retiree, was hospitalized in Shanghai with severe respiratory distress and pneumonia. On March 4, Li went into severe cardio-respiratory failure and succumbed.

On Feb. 27, fell ill with respiratory distress, was hospitalized, and died on March 10. The day Wu succumbed a third individual, a 35-year-old woman identified as Han, was hospitalized in the city of Nanjing, though she came from distant Chuzhou City, about 300 miles northwest of Shanghai. Han is reportedly in critical condition

The elderly Li may have been part of a family cluster of illness, but has survived.

On March 31 -- Easter in the United States -- China's newly created National Health and Family Planning Commission (which includes the former Ministry of Health) announced that 87-year-old Li, the other a survivor) were not infected with the flu virus -- their ailments were reportedly coincidental, though they occurred at the same time as the elder Li's demise.

So much for the backstory: What is going on?

According to Chinese authorities, and samples of the virus were isolated from Huangpu River. The implication was that the Shanghai pigs died of PCV-2, a type of virus that is harmless to human beings, as well as birds. Photographs of the carcasses reveal that the animals were large adult hogs, but PCV-2 does not kill adult pigs -- it is lethal to fetuses and newborn piglets.

The Chinese health authorities have to date offered no cause of death for the ducks and swans, people, and birds. Though the surviving woman, Han, had some contact with live chickens, according to Xinhua, neither Li nor Wu had any known contact with birds. Wu has been identified variously as a butcher, and employee of a meat plant -- all of which might imply he had contact with pigs.

Influenzas are named according to the specific nature of two proteins found on the virus -- the H stands for hemaggluntinin and the N for neuraminidase. These proteins play various roles in the flu-infection process, the H7N9 forms of flu have never previously managed to infect human beings, or any mammals -- it is a class of the virus found exclusively in birds. It is therefore extremely worrying to find two people killed and one barely surviving due to H7N9 infection.

One very plausible explanation for this chain of Chinese events is that the H7N9 virus has undergone a mutation -- perhaps among spring migrating birds around Lake Qinghai. The mutation rendered the virus lethal for domestic ducks and swans. Because many Chinese farmers raise both pigs and ducks, has occurred many times. Once influenza adapts to pig cells, it is often possible for the virus to take human-transmissible form. That's precisely what happened in 2009 with the H1N1 swine flu, which spread around the world in a massive, but thankfully not terribly virulent, pandemic.

If the pigs, it is imperative and urgent that the biological connection be made, and extensive research be done to determine how widespread human infection may be. Shanghai health authorities have tested dozens of people known to have been in contact with Wu and Li, none of whom have come up positive for H7N9 infection. Assuming the tests are accurate, the mystery of Li and Wu's infections only deepens. Moreover, if they are a ""two of three,"" meaning two dead, the H7N9 virus is very virulent.

""At this point, Dr. Michael O'Leary, told reporters on Monday. But, O'Leary added, the possibility of a family cluster of illness could not be ruled out, and, ""We don't know yet the causes of illness in the two sons, if three people in one family acquire severe pneumonia in a short period of time

But Hong Kong authorities,"" the Centre for Health Protection in Hong Kong stated in a press release on Monday.

The Chinese National Influenza Center has posted the H7N9 genetic sequences of viruses from Li, though none of the birds strains were obtained from animals in 2013.

The mystery is deep

If we were imagining how a terrible pandemic would unfold

So

I have been teaching for awhile in China now and I was surprised at how well thought out and considered many of thier opinions were. Usually

So

Each person gets one vote and they cannot vote for thier own party. This point proved fatal later.  

So

They essentially dividied into three parties.

The Force Party: Whose platform was to build up the military

Thier motto was

The second party was The Money Party. Thier platform consisted of economic reforms that would allow a greater majority of people to prosper. Those are my words. They just said

Thier motto: No money

The third and smallest party was The People Power Party (PPP). There  platform was to bring Democracy to China. They didn't really understand the ""lesson"".

So

The Money Party attempted to appeal to people's self-interest but was brutally attacked as a lackey of ""outsiders"".

The PPP had no luck. They had no clue what they were doing. 

In the end

Everyone voted for themselves. 

So

Everyone voted for themselves. 

Then I tried to do a Proportional Representation system where they all  got two votes. One they could vote for themselves and the second vote had to be for another party.

I got confused with all the ballots and decided that the Force Party won.

Why is everything Japan always cleaner, and everything China is always a clusterfuck?

Here's how I would do it:

Welcome to /r/China. (no irc link)

Eager to ask a question? Check here first!

1. Travel stuff to /r/travel (is this really a good rule? We seem to welcome these posts as long as they are well thought out). Translation stuff to /r/ChineseLanguage 

2. Check the common questions listed below.

3. Search this subreddit and google.

4. Still have questions? Write your question in a clear concise manner

Common questions:

1. Interested in visiting China? Give us some information about yourself, for how long, and what you like to do. It would help if you told us what you've found already in your research, and what holes are still missing for you. You may also consider /r/travel, or perusing through these classic threads:

2. Want to come to China long term? Have a question about visas, what you want to do in China and why in particular China, and what your qualifications are. You may also consider /r/chinavisa, /r/chinajobs, or these classic threads:

3. Want to discuss Chinese culture? Be mindful of any cultural biases you may carry

4. Concerned about the great firewall? Want to learn about VPNs and torrenting? China blocks youtube and facebook

Subreddits in the /r/China family:

cpop  
chinesetv  
chinavisa  
chinajobs  
whatever else  
don't include /r/travel that is just silly

Regional subreddits  
shenzhen  
hongkong  
beijing  
etc

(2) What do you think about the Cultural Revolution? Was it good

A few weekends ago we met up with a few Redditors (and friends) to make the ~2 hour journey out to Wonderland. It was a foggy day

We'd heard rumors of security guards

The park consists of the wall / gates buildings, and  we could even get onto the roof. Then farther back past some old corn fields is a huge unfinished metal structure. And all the way in the back is the concrete castle most photos show. You can walk around behind the castle and explore the lower area, but it was dark and there were some kids inside so instead we scaled the front wall. From there there are two spiral staircases that go all the way up to the top. The view from the atop spires was amazing.

I'm now going to pretend I'm an anthropologist studying a lost tribe. Or a woman

The only reason I post this here is because it's a followup to my last post

Anyway, but I'm not exactly sure if he's interested in me. We met at an English corner of all places, and then lost contact, and then a few months ago, I was looking into buying a Nook (didn't), and he offered to help me. From there he invited me to a few more English corners, and a weekly game night. Usually he picks me up from the bus stop (which is not weird, Chinese people are awesome to guests, he's initiated. We just talk about whatever

I think he's a great guy, and I suggested we get dinner, and he told me he'd ""rather eat alone."" Again, I didn't think too much about it, but I was a little disappointed. We talk on qq pretty often, and I introduced him to Quentin Tarantino, who he really liked, and I loved it

Wow, so bite me) and he was hanging out with a bunch of teachers and students who are out for the New Year, so he had to leave early. He didn't say goodbye to me, so, I figured, it's cool, we're just friends, I got all that from him not saying goodbye. Curse my female mind!) But later he sent me a text saying goodnight and goodbye

Cut to last night. We had a great time with a bunch of other people. I was adorable as usual :P At one point he asked me what kind of body shape I like in a guy (because one of the Americans that was with us was super swole), and I thought the question was kind of random. I also invited him (the whole table, honestly) to come to my campus to see it (because it's actually really pretty with lots of natural features), but in a vague ""you should see it"" kind of way. And he basically was like, ""Yes! As soon as you're back in town, I'm going to come."" with an enthusiasm which seemed more than usual. Then it was about midnight, and everybody started heading out. I was exhausted because I went to bed at around three the night before (ktv), and he said no rush, and I answered (truthfully) only the guys at the game nights, I looked at my watch at three

Then he sent me a message tonight wishing me a good journey. We chatted a little more before I told him I had to go to bed.

If this were the States, {name redacted} isn't. At least I hope he's not). So, I'm going to see how it plays out. I don't know what signs I should be looking for or whatever, but I feel like something is happening. He's texted me a couple times when I was out of town wondering when I'd be back in, and even my girlfriends don't do that. So, maybe, the advice to just be myself, it's just pure speculation and nothing remotely official yet

**TLDR;** Lady issues, advice plz, etc. ad infinitum.

I got to the corner and still no one had even so much as stopped to see why this man

I went over and squatted down, after a couple more shakes he came to. 

I said in Chinese that he was in the road with cars everywhere and he couldn't stay there. He moaned and looked around dazed, so I moved along. I was already pissed that the police were kind of dickish but whatever I figured, did a good deed today. 

This lady stops me while I'm crossing the street and I am ready to say with great humility ""oh no, and she's bitching at me that I'm an idiot for checking on the guy. 

And Yes, you are bound to have a couple idiots, that doesn't mean you stop helping each other... What if that man had been her grandfather?

And no, just very frustrated right now, I think the lady afterwards just made it that much worse. I can understand not helping the guy, it happens all over, but to then come up to someone who does help him and tell him not to do it again... 

Then if that wasn't enough, I looked at the front and there was this 6 or 7 year old trying to pull their sleigh up but it was caught on a chunk of snow and the kid couldn't pull hard enough, there was an bloody line of people standing there, getting angry, one actually said ""Kuai dian..."" to the kid... and not one single person had the decency to walk up and help the child. I had to push my way to the front, getting many angry glares, and help the kid. 

Second time I went up a lady, her feet (very icy and hard to walk on) and pull the sleigh while everyone watched... She just about fell twice with the child in her arms.. I picked up her sleigh and carried it up to the top for her. 

Again. I know not all Chinese are this way... but fuck me... today was apparently the ""Fuck Everyone Else"" day and no one told me... I've seen a lot of frustrating shit over the past 8 years but today just killed me

1315359468.0,k72gu,Mooncake? Yes Please!,lanfa,33,7,22,"Arriving in early Autumn five years ago

""Mmmm Boy, complete with fancy packaging."" 

I was new in China and wanted to assimilate. Surely there was no better way to absorb a foreign culture than to eat its food. So I delicately and respectfully opened the gold inlayed red packaging. Inside, I was hungry and pastries, no matter how beautiful, were meant for eating. 

I lifted up one of the velvet treats and brought it close to my face for closer inspection. It was heavy and golden brown. I spun it front of eyes examining as closely as an appraiser might inspect a piece of valuable antiquity. No smell

I brought it to my mouth and nibbled at the crust. Butter? Sesame? There was some sort of white paste
""Mmm, I bit half way into the mooncake. 

Surprise rankled through me. Where's that wonderful almond flavor of the marzipan? What's that slight oily flavor crawling up my nose? Fish?!? FISH! The glory of the pastry had been defiled

My stomach roiled and I gagged. The mooncake slid from my mouth into my hand leaving behind a thin bridge of saliva.

""Welcome to China

My eyes narrowed and I crossed my arms. ""Alright

I discarded the slop in my hand and tossed the rest of the fishy mooncake into my mouth. It was foul, fish and bone. 

I breathed heavy and puffed out my chest. Three more to go. I pulled out another mooncake and gave it a thorough examination. It was lighter in weight and color; the calligraphy atop was different. But when I bit in once again there was that same flavorless paste. But wait, and licked it. Egg yolk. I happily finished the rest of it, almost enjoying the flavor.

The third mooncake was the same as second

My stomach had turned to lead. I feared for my bowels as I went fourth and final mooncake. With a breath

Afterwards

second, people at small street stands, blaxis, taxis in second and lower tier cities, be on the lookout. first tier dept stores will never give you fake cash

ok, and it's how fake bills will feel when you scratch the fake collar. this is by far the most expedient way to check for fake bills. 

dont assume that only 100s and 50s are faked. for me

finally, and return the counterfeit to you and demanding a real bill. watch out for that. just keep a close eye on the money until the transaction is complete.

o right, your best bet is to pawn it off in quick and busy transactions. mopeds, kfc at rush hour are good choices. altenatively keep it as a memento. don't go to the police: they won't be able to do much, and you're just inviting the hassle of police forms.

1350885056.0,11vtlf,Can China really follow the Singaporean development model?,whocares65,31,4,35,"Another day

What I'm surprised by is the use of the term ""Singapore model"". For a long time now the (Western) media has been talking about a ""China model"". Even China's leaders have, and in any case the term ""Singapore model"" was rarely, if ever, used. ""With Chinese characteristics"" seemed to be the preferred catchphrase, whether used seriously (by the government) or jokingly (by netizens). Therefore, I'm curious as to what the renewed focus on a ""Singapore model"" means. 

China has been fascinated by Singapore's success story [since Deng's time](http://www.nytimes.com/1992/08/09/weekinreview/the-world-china-sees-singapore-as-a-model-for-progress.html). Beyond economics, Gong Li) becoming Singaporean citizens; many netizens viewed the Singaporean prime minister's [warning about Chinese perceptions of the US](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/07/world/asia/singapores-prime-minister-warns-china-on-view-of-us.html) as a ""betrayal"", indicating that the Chinese believe Singapore to be on their side internationally.

So it makes sense for China to admire the Singapore model. But can China really emulate it? I'm not convinced. China finds the Singaporean model attractive because of

1. De-facto one-party rule
2. Economic prosperity
3. Tough laws and regulations leading to a clean
4. An ethnic Chinese majority

But here's the thing: I don't think the Singapore model scales up well. The methods used to govern a city-state won't all work when applied to a country of 1.3 billion. 

For example

Beyond that

1. State support for cultural
2. A robust legal system
3. High immigrant population (~42% non-citizens)
3. High public salaries and correspondingly low rates of corruption

In short

**UPDATE**: I sent her an email that said I couldn't use her contributions in the report because she sent me blatant plagiarism and we could all get expelled.  I then went on to explain the concepts of plagiarism, proper citation format, etc.  Finally I told her that luckily, because it was only a draft version, I just submitted it without her sections and suspect that won't be too much of a problem, but that she needs to fix her contributions for next time.

She replied, yes, of course its not allowed to copy.""  So, maybe that is an encouraging sign?  Then she went on a big explanation that sort of just went into more detail about how she expected me to do her work for her.  ""I copied that because I was worried I would explain it wrong."" and ""I sent you that passage of 2 pages so you could read it and pick out interesting facts when you are writing the report.""  She did however end by saying  ""I feel sorry that I didn't do more things in this part:(...But I will do more in next step!""

http://www.stratfor.com/analysis/chinas-limits-reducing-tensions-japan

**Summary**

Some 1

To make matters worse, Beijing may soon find itself unable to back down from the dispute.

**A Useful Distraction**

Beijing quickly seized upon the Japanese government's Sept. 12 decision to buy three of the Diaoyu/Senkaku Islands (there are five total) from their private Japanese owner in order to shift national attention away from China's domestic problems. These include the upcoming generational leadership transition

**The Senkaku/Diaoyu Islands Dispute**

Anti-Japanese protests quickly broke out in Chinese cities, Shanghai and Nanjing, protesters marched outside Japanese diplomatic compounds amid a heavy security presence, which largely prevented violence. In Xian, one of the cities that led anti-Japanese protests in 2005 and 2010, tens of thousands of people marched to the city's center on the morning of Sept. 15. The protest turned violent as Japanese-made cars were overturned and smashed and Japanese restaurants and shops were attacked. In the southern city of Changsha, protesters set fires in the streets and attacked and looted a large Japanese-owned department store. The scene was similar in a number of other cities, Shenzhen and Guangzhou.

Although the government and official media outlets have maintained the steady stream of strong,"" which warned the public to be rational and obey the law during protests. Some local public security bureaus are also beginning to take a stronger approach to dealing with the protesters. Guangzhou's public security bureau announced Sept. 17 that at least 10 rioters had been detained by police forces after they smashed Japanese vehicles and vandalized Japanese shops. In Xian, public gatherings, demonstrations and marches lacking official approval are now strictly prohibited. But the state continues to make numerous statements concerning its rights to the Diaoyu/Senkaku Islands and highlighting Japan's purported violation of Chinese sovereignty.

**Problems with Backing Down**

A major problem for China is that the government has framed the Japanese move not as an administrative action that simply shifted ownership of the islands from a private Japanese citizen to the government (which had already been renting the islands to ensure that nobody was allowed to build or land on them), but portraying the issue in this manner served domestic political needs. Chinese officials, who have stirred up the protests and declared that they will defend Chinese sovereignty, now find that their ability to de-escalate the situation is limited since any de-escalation could be seen as weakness and capitulation to the Japanese.

Beijing has already warned that there will be economic ramifications if Japan does not back down on its claim to the Diaoyu/Senkaku Islands. Nearly a quarter of all Japanese overseas non-manufacturing enterprises are in China, China would not be unaffected by a serious economic conflict with Japan. China had a $22 billion trade surplus with Japan in 2011, while Japanese firms account for 4 percent of incoming foreign direct investment in China and Japanese businesses directly employ one million Chinese workers. Attacks on Japanese cars and businesses also harm the Chinese citizens who own and operate many of them, and several Japanese companies are now considering temporarily suspending operations in China -- or worse, reducing or ending such operations, which could lead companies from other countries to follow suit.

Another problem for Beijing is that, such as government corruption and social grievances. Already there are signs of this -- though sporadic -- in the current protests. Anti-government forces or citizens looking to bring their own issues to the table can exploit the mass of individuals on the streets -- something Beijing is much less willing to tolerate. Attempts to rein in protests, if too aggressive, can quickly shift attention away from Japan and the island dispute and toward the Chinese government itself.

Beijing knows Tokyo will not change its administrative control over the islands, shown some restraint by sending coast guard and fisheries administration ships to the islands instead of naval vessels. For China's leadership, there is a benefit to keeping the patriotic protests active and keeping the Diaoyu/Senkaku issue front and center, at least until the leadership transition is complete next March. But the longer the protests are allowed to go on, the more likely they are to change focus and the more likely Beijing is to lose control of them. Yet, by framing the issue as one of active Japanese usurpation of Chinese territory, it is difficult to see where and how Beijing can step back without being seen as weak by the Chinese people.

Lieberthal’s lecture was part of the Policy Talks series at U-M’s Ford School of Public Policy  and was co-sponsored by the International Policy Center.

From 1983 to 2009, was published by the Brookings Press in March 2012.

A video of Lieberthal’s entire talk  at the Ford School is available here.

Here are a few edited excerpts from his wide-ranging presentation:

China and the latest North Korean nuclear test

“What constrains China is two things in regard to North Korea. One is that it’s very, very near the U.S. southern border that have not lacked U.S. attention over the years, and we’ve never been able to get them to do what we want them to do.”

“In addition, China does fear instability in North Korea. Big time. And what they fear is that what they will end up with is a unified nuclear Korean peninsula in bed with the United States. That’s a terrible outcome from their perspective.”

“I think in fact there are some things China can do

“In the U.N.

Three things China can do

“Quietly say to them we have two big asks. One is: The North Korean nuclear and missile program – my understanding is – is organically tied to the Iranian nuclear and missile program. The two nuclear programs have been joined at the hip for years. So when North Korea tests a nuclear weapon – I don’t know this for sure – but I think there’s a good chance the data are going to Iran

“Secondly, there’s face involved.”

“The third thing I would do is see if the Xi (Jinping) administration is willing to sit down with us and South Korea and talk about what we do if there is a dramatic contingency in North Korea. Not that we need to act together. But we should know what each other is thinking about – what are our plans. For example, to pacify it and to try to identify where the nuclear materials are and to prevent mass refugee flows into China. Well, guess what. The U.S. and South Korea have similar plans. It would not be surprising to learn that there are parts of North Korea that both militaries would have operational orders to seize and hold. If we’re not talking to each other, we could end up shooting at each other, which is not an outcome anyone wants to have. We have never had a conversation with China about long-tern contingencies in North Korea. Never. ”

Easing tensions between Japan and China 

“I don’t think China and Japan are going to start shooting at each other as an act of conscious policy. Both of them realize if there is a real conflict

“The danger here is that there are enough boats and enough planes increasingly challenging each other, this will turn instantaneously into a whole different problem.”

“I think what they have to do is – it’s too early to try to get governments to negotiate this; there’s too much face and too much passion – to get some of the elders from each side who have known each for many years and trust each other and who have commanded respect from the current leaders in each of their respective countries. Have them get together and not work out a final resolution but work on steps that each can take unilaterally to pull back, to try to get some workable agreement. It will not resolve sovereignty. Sovereignty is very  difficult to negotiate.”",,False,,t5_2qh2v,False,,
