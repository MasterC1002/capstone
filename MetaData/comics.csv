EDIT 2: Giving my hand a rest for a sec (3pm EST)

Here's the new book: http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/weiner/science-ruining-everything-since-1543-an-smbc-coll

It's a bunch of favorite comics, Ed Yong, and Adam Savage.

NOW THEN

I did this a while back and was doing full color art. This time I'm gonna do quicker sketches so I can try to get to more people's requests. 

A humble request: So I can get to more people

1317402032.0,kwmk3,PAGE NOT IMAGE - an essay by an annoyed webcartoonist,LukeSurl,3239,1895,273,"Yesterday a cartoon I made had a fair degree of success on Reddit. The quite nerdy joke about chess is at 3, gaygeek and gaymers subreddits as well.

The cartoon in question is http://www.lukesurl.com/archives/1181 . It’s one of the jokes I’m most proud of

However that wasn’t the link redditors were directed to. Instead the link which got this attention was directly to the .png image from my server. This is something I’m not happy about. It happens frequently to lots of comics on Reddit and a LOT more on often on Stumbleupon.

It isn’t a new thing – on the ‘comics’ subreddit there’s a mantra: ‘page not image’. Posting a link directly to the image, “make the Mods go hulk smash on you”. A link to a rehosted comic (i.e. uploaded to imjur or similar) is a mortal sin.

The logic is fairly obvious – the webcartoonist will have other things on that page they’d like you to see. There may be ads which help pay the hosting bills, convention appearances etc. All this is lost with the direct image link. Critically, the chance to convert a casual stumbler into a regular reader is reduced to near zero. Furthermore there’s a disservice to the reader – many sites have extra content connected with the cartoon – blog posts, discussion sections, mouseover text etc.

A more nebulous point is that

It happens to everyone, an xkcd or a SMBC comic is directly linked to, within three minutes someone is going to track down the page link, and any visitor is likely to know who deserves the credit (and possibly an archive trawl in the near future). If it’s by someone who’s basically unknown this is far less likely to happen. Unknowns like myself dream that a few cartoons we’ve made will go viral, and maybe this would be our ‘big break’.

For example: http://www.lukesurl.com/archives/916 and http://www.lukesurl.com/archives/1243 both were widely shared. You’ve probably read them. You probably didn’t know they were done by me however

Cartoonists could start sending DMCA emails and that all day

Like I said before, is probably paying a hosting service for the privilege of providing it to you. Please take the effort to share their work in the way they want it to be seen.

Thanks

**Luke**
