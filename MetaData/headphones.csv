Thirty years ago I use to travel a lot fixing scanning electron microscopes. I had a Walkman and thought it sounded like crap.  So I bought some Beyerdynamic DT801 headphones. They were much better than the stock earbuds, in a brilliant flash of neurons, I realized that the wimpy headphone amp circuits in the Discman might not be fully capable of authoritative control of the headphones. What I needed was a miniature power amplifier for my cans. I set to work building one, and when done I was very happy to hear my cans blossom into full throat.

And so it began. 

Some ten years later I had the opportunity to start a company and remembered that little headphone amp. If I felt the need for it

I spent a lot of time encouraging enthusiastic headphone listening on-line first on Chu Moy’s HeadWize headphone forum, but I have been there all the way along, and I truly love the activity.

* 0 – MEElectronics M6 ($15): Solid cabling from MEElec with little microponics


Clip-On:

* 0 -Koss KSC75 ($15): Koss still has a budget beast with the KSC75. ""Fun"" sound signature. Slightly muddy bass

**$20-$60:**

Semi-open or closed:

* 0 -Monoprice MHP-839 AKA 8323 ($21): Rebrand of the Kicker HP541, smoothly rolled off highs.

* 0 - Incipio Forte F38 ($30): These are a rebrand of the Fischer Audio FA-004s AKA the Brainwavz HM3s. In its price bracket, because it comes in at a slight angle. The sound isolation on these is a bit low.

* 0 -Koss Portapro ($35): Basically

* 0 -Panasonic HTF600 ($30): Very warm and forgiving headphone with a heavy bass emphasis. Bass can be described as slow and muddy

* 1 -Superlux HD681 ($38): Very good detailing for its price bracket. Semi-open design, tight impactful slightly emphasized bass. Slight V-curve due to midbass hump. Bright highs. 

* 1 -Superlux HD668B ($50): These are very similar to the Superlux HD681 in terms of sound signature. They have a removable cable and stock cables of 3' length for portable use and 10' use for home usage. Slightly deeper bass

* 1 -CAD Audio MH310 ($47): Closed back Superlux. Expect very similar sound to the other Superluxes

* 0 -JVC HARX700 ($40): This traditional $30-40 headphone choice is still a decent one

* 0 -Sony XB500 ($50): The other budget basshead headphone. Responds very well to equalization. Bass is very

* 0 -Creative Aurvana Live! ($60-90): Rebrand of the discontinued Denon AH-D1001, good bass extension, lively highs and good balance. Less isolation than most closed headphones, isolates about as much as the semi-open Superluxes. Very comfortable. Price fluctuates a lot.

**$60-$150**

Closed:

* 0 -Sony MDR-V6 ($75): Classic studio monitor. Has been in use since the 80s and still sees use today. Neutral sound presentation

* 0 -Shure SRH-440 ($70): Studio monitor headphones that are quite detailed for the price

* 1 / 2 -Fostex T20RP/T50RP ($60/75): Cheapest modern planar magnetic headphone on the market. Can rival headphones several times its price after modding. Becomes very dependent on amping after modding. Stock sound signature is very mid-centric

* 1 -Koss Pro DJ100s ($50): Bass emphasized DJ headphones. Average comfort and isolation. Very forward mids and very clear vocals. Above average soundstage for a closed headphone. Coiled cable. Requires a very good seal for bass. Lifetime warranty. 

* 1 -KRK KNS 6400/8400 ($100/$150): Very clean and detailed for its price bracket. 6400 is very midcentric without much bass (can be fixed with EQ)

* 0 -Audio-Technica ATH-M50 ($120): Still a fan favorite at Head-Fi. Borderline bass heavy. Recessed mids. Slight V-shaped frequency response. Can handle any genre thrown at it

* 0 -Skullcandy Aviators ($120): The only truly good and cost effective Skullcandy ever made. Mid-bass hump with borderline “one-note” bass and not much bass extension. Solid upper-bass and treble. Surprisingly competitive in its price bracket. Has the Skullcandy style.

* 1 -Digitech Pro Monitors($70)/Brainwavz HM5 ($100): Rebrands of the popular Fischer Audio FA-003. Big comfortable headphones with a neutral presentation. High detail

* 1 -Shure SRH840 ($140): Studio monitors with a neutral presentation that leans a bit to the bright side. 




Open:

* 0 -Grado SR60i/SR80i ($80/$100): The classic Grado sound – very bright presentation with very forward mids. Punchy bass that drops off quickly. Narrow soundstage
* 0 -Alessandro MS-1 ($99): Read the above for the Grados and make it slightly more neutral and less bright. For those who want a less bright alternative to the Grados. 
* 0 -Audio-Technica ATH-AD700 ($100): The typical “gamer’s headphone.” Very wide soundstage with clear and detailed mids and highs. Very underemphasized

**$150-$250:**

Closed: 

* 1 – Ultrasone HFI-780 ($150): Good tight bass. Poor all-arounder
* 1 -Sennheiser HD25-1 II ($200): The prototypical portable headphone. Good isolation, aggressive treble with a punchy and quick bass.
* 0 -V-Moda M80/V80 ($200): Very stylish portable with a slight bass emphasis (mostly neutral presentation) that is built like a tank. Indestructible build quality. Comes with consumer features like an in-line microphone. Better lows than the HD25-1 ii. Good punch and dynamics.
* 0 -Beyerdynamic DT770 Pro ($200): Fun, exaggerated midbass. 
* 2 -AKG K701/2 &amp; Q701: (~$230-250): Neutral presentation with tight bass. Bass is most criticized part of headphone as it can lacking in presence. Difficult to drive headphones due to low sensitivity and low impedance. Articulate

Open:

* 0 -Grado 125i/225i ($150/$200): This is the Grado sound
* 1 -Sennheiser HD598 ($175-$230): Very comfortable velour pads. Relatively fun signature with a mid-bass hump. Wide soundstage. Good clarity in highs
* 2 -Sennheiser HD580 ($160-200): This is a discontinued headphone. It has a very similar driver to the HD600 and shares many of its characteristics. Probably the greatest bargain in this price range for the fidelity. Very detailed, great mids. Bass is a little loose. Comfortable.

1357250955.0,15wunp,[GUIDE] DACs and Amps,SanjiWatsuki,166,18,55,"One of the biggest questions I have seen around here is whether or not an amp or DAC is needed and if so which ones to get. This will only cover the basics of headphone amps and DACs

**What is a DAC/amp?**

When you play any sounds out of your computer or phone or MP3 player, or a DAC. 

A DAC by itself

All sound cards, amp, and recording parts all into a single unit. DAC standalone units have the DAC, but require an amp if they want to be used with headphones. Amp standalone units will only take a signal from a DAC or output from another amp and amplify it.

**Should I get a standalone DAC?**

 All modern computers have DACs and amps built into them


Typically


For example


**Should I get a standalone amp?**

Aftermarket amps are typically needed in one of three situations.

1.	I have a standalone DAC that needs an amp to function.
2.	My headphones are not loud enough.
3.	My sound card/stereo receiver/MP3 player outputs with a very high output impedance which is causing my headphones to be voiced differently than they were originally tuned.

If you fall under any of these three cases

**How expensive of an amp do I need to pair with my headphones?**

There actually is a lot of lovely math behind this. [Long story short

Amps on the level of the $99 Schiit Magni [6.2V into 32 ohms] or $150 O2 [7.3V into 600 ohms] will power anything short of the extremely power hungry headphones (Hifiman HE-6 or AKG K1000) to reasonable volume for almost anybody.

Reviews: [Short Review](http://www.head-fi.org/t/642401/comparison-and-review-o2-odac-vs-magni-modi) |  [Headfonics Review](http://headfonics.com/2013/01/the-modi-and-magni-insane-schitt-at-99/)

Overview:  The Modi has been almost universally praised as an excellent DAC. The combination of the Modi and Magni have likely dethroned the Objective2 stack as the premier value amp + DAC. It is capable of using 24-bit audio which means that you don’t have to worry about dynamic range when using the Windows volume control, there are currently no independent measurements to really show the objective quality of the Modi.

For the about 6 years, so I held onto them as long as possible (still have them, no hard feelings against them). Besides those headphones, I have a set of beyond shitty Altec Lansing speakers. So that's how I've listened to music for a long time.

This past week, and I can hear the hiss of their amps, the rattle in the kick and snare drums. I put on a Ryan Adams album and I could hear his breathing, the stool under him squeaking. I realized there were all of these little human elements in my favorite albums that I was missing out on. Thanks to such an amazing flat line frequency response, and such a clear, crisp sound.  These headphones have made me excited to listen to music again. Everything sounds so different now.

###**The  Headphones**


###Koss KSC75

**Cost:** $15

**Pros:** Phenomenal sound quality for the price, very moddable, good for working out. 

**Cons:** Low sound isolation (this also means sound leakage). Not a full sized headphone. Treble can be considered spiky for some. Sub-bass roll off. Clips fall off easily.

**Voltage to 110dB SPL:** 0.69V at 60 ohm impedance (calculated from provided Koss sensitivity and impedance #s)

**Links of Note:**

[Head-Fi Reviews](http://www.head-fi.org/products/koss-ksc75-portable-stereophone-headphones/reviews)

[Best Headphones Guide Review](http://www.bestheadphonesguide.com/2012/05/koss-ksc-75-review/)

[InnerFidelity’s Wall of Fame](http://www.innerfidelity.com/content/innerfidelitys-wall-fame-ear-pad-open)

**Explanation:**

Are you intending to spend less than $20 and you don’t have sound isolation as one of the biggest priorities? Buy a Koss KSC75. There is nothing that comes close to competing with it in this price bracket. Furthermore

They have a kind of Alessandro-line tuning to them that is a lot like Grado, the shouty vocals, but you don’t have the treble set nearly as piercingly high. Even if you don’t like the overall tonality, just equalize the darn thing – you’re not going to get better sound for $15. 

**Measurements**

Here are the measurements done by purrin

[Here is the frequency response of the headphones.](http://i.imgur.com/oWnmJ.jpg)

[Here is the waterfall CSD of the headphones.]( http://i.imgur.com/KlhKs.jpg)

One thing to note is that the waterfall CSD of these headphones is exceedingly clean for the price. Do you want a fun comparison? [Here is the waterfall CSD for a pair of Grado RS1s.]( http://i.imgur.com/6tawl.jpg) The Grado RS1s cost $695 new. Look at the axes and compare the sound decay rates. Believe it or not, has measurements that imply that in many ways the driver is quicker and more accurate than the Grado RS1s. Just think about that – these are $15 headphones that are coming close to arguably beating $695 headphones by these numbers. Even if you don’t believe that the KSC75s belong with the better Grados (and most people don't), everyone certainly finds them to be one of the absolute best in their price bracket.

**Sonic Reviews**
That said, but you’ll find few real comparisons between the two. One example of someone that prefers them to the lower end Grados, at least, is the link in the Best Headphones Guide review. 

**Other Things of Note**

The Koss KSC75 is considered a headphone that is very moddable. These mods will influence the overall sound of the headphone. I’ve decided to run down a few of the basic mods that you see done to KSC75s. 

Common mods include the quarter mod, which involves soldering in a 75 ohm resistor into the headphone to increase the amount of bass. [Looking at the impedance graph for the Koss Portapro, which uses the same driver, we can calculate that we can expect a few dB increase in the mid-bass region centered at 100hz when we add this resistor.]( http://www.innerfidelity.com/images/KossPortaPro.pdf) Basically, add the resistor for a bass boost. 

#You can often find a cheap headband for the KSC75s by buying a cheap Parts Expression headphone. The headband fits. [You can buy this for $2 + shipping.](http://www.parts-express.com/pe/pshowdetl.cfm?&amp;Partnumber=240-015&amp;scqty=3)

###Monoprice 8323:
**Cost:** $21-23 + shipping

**Pros:** Solid mid-bass slam, good sound isolation, warm headphone with a decent mid-range. 

**Cons:** Recessed treble

**Voltage to 110dB SPL:** 0.25V at 43 ohm impedance (using the measurements from InnerFidelity)

[Head-Fi Reviews](http://www.head-fi.org/products/monoprice-mhp-839/reviews/) [(2)]( http://www.head-fi.org/t/608120/the-30-budget-comparison-monoprice-8323-vs-panny-rp-htf600-vs-incipio-f38)

[InnerFidelity’s Monoprice 8323 Measurements] (http://www.innerfidelity.com/images/Monoprice8323.pdf)

**Explanation**
In the computer world, they have the Monoprice 8320s. For headphones, they have our Monoprice 8323 (MHP-839). It’s a rebrand of the Kicker HP-541 headphones, which typically sold for $50. Back several years ago, they were considered pretty darn good headphones for $50. Imagine the community’s surprise when they surfaced selling for only $21. 

These do many things which other headphones in this price bracket DON’T do. For example, use the 1m cable. Furthermore, if one channel starts dying because of a small break in the cable, you can just buy a new one for a dollar or two, rather than replacing the entire headphone. For this reason, the Monoprice 8323 has been my standby recommendation for students looking for a beater headphone to toss into their backpack and take back and forth from classes. 

**Measurements**

[The only published measurements for the Monoprice 8323 is the InnerFidelity graphs.]( http://www.innerfidelity.com/images/Monoprice8323.pdf) 

You can see a roll-off into the sub-bass frequencies and a hump in the mid-bass. The %THD+noise implies that the headphones, the distortion is quite low for a headphone of this price bracket. The low distortion numbers combined with the relatively square looking 300 Hz square wave back up impressions that these have a pretty tight bass response.  

The treble looks pretty receded

**Sonic Reviews**

Starting with the highs and moving down, and I’m certain that you could tame the sibilance and bring out the lower treble with equalization, but their stock treble is definitely the weak point of the 8323. 

The mids were not bad. They have forward sounding mids, though, there isn’t anything truly exceptional in the mids, but they do a good job presenting them.  I agree more with MudPie’s review, rather than MalVeauX’s review, on Head-Fi because I found the mids pleasant, but I disagree that the MHP-839 is a “mids-monster” in their price bracket.  

The lows are where the Monoprices have a strong point in their price bracket. They’re bass heavy headphones that roll off the upper mids and treble for a very warm sound. The bass is tight and punchy with solid extension for a budget headphone. It’s certainly north of neutral in terms of overall tonality


**Other Notes**

Yes, which will set you back around $20, typically reduce the bass response on the headphones and are significantly more comfortable and less sweaty than the 8323s. If you really like your 8323s, these are a perfect upgrade for long-time listening.

It seems that there is an ever growing number of headphone request posts that are very vague and leave us asking the same questions, use?"" and so on. In a hopes to help people be more concise when looking for a new product as well as allowing us to help easier I'm writing this basic outline on what **needs** to be posted when asking for headphones recommendations. If the posts don't follow this format then I will be removing them, so please read and submit your questions in this manner so we can help.

First things first though

* **Budget** - We need to know how much you want to spend.
* **Source** - What are you plugging these into?
* **Requirements for Isolation** - Do you need a lot, more isolation will block outside noises, none will not.
* **Preferred Type of Headphone** - Do you want IEMs
* **Preferred Tonality** - Do you prefer highs, or do you like them balanced? 
* **Past headphones** - What have you used in the past
* **Preferred Music** - What do you listen to?

This is the information now necessary to ask for a headphone recommendation, but to help the user who is asking the question. 

Additionally, typically, it's one of the following:

* Missing information (In other words
* Frequently answered (If you are the 3727th person to ask about M-50's
* Off-topic/not headphone-related.

**Amp and DAC Explanation**

After you've decided on your headphone be sure to check out SanjiWatsuki's [DAC and Amplifier](http://www.reddit.com/r/headphones/comments/15wunp/guide_dacs_and_amps/) guide that explains amps and DACs in good depth.

###Koss Portapro

**Cost:** $35

**Pros:** Bassier version of the KSC75
**Cons:** Bass can be muddy. Treble can be not shiny enough. Fragile. Headband can be pinchy. Retro look. Almost no sound isolation and high leakage.

**Voltage to 110dB SPL:** 0.47V at 60 ohm impedance (using the measurements from InnerFidelity)

[InnerFidelity Measurements](http://www.innerfidelity.com/images/KossPortaPro.pdf)

[HeadRoom Comparison](http://i.imgur.com/HKvuL.png)

**Explanation**

This is another headphone based on the famous Koss 60-ohm driver that is found in the KSC75, the Portapro has been considered one of the better value headphones for quite some time, but I haven’t seen it suggested as much lately. Regardless, a headphone has to be doing something right to last for over 25 years and still be considered competitive.

**Measurements**

[First off
These measurements look legitimate and we can verify them against the InnerFidelity measurements. The basics of the story? Treble is receded almost pretty 3-5 dB or so from the KSC75, anywhere from 2dB to a whopping 5dB at 20hz. The housing can’t perform miracles, though, and the Portapros are still rolling off the sub-bass frequencies.
We do not have a waterfall CSD plot for the Portapro, in the HeadRoom measurements, the divot is significantly less than the KSC75 one. This MIGHT imply that the ringing is not as much at 5khz.
 
The InnerFidelity measurements also show high distortion into the bass frequencies – this is indicative of the somewhat muddy bass response. It’s difficult for cheap open driver headphones to not roll-off the bass and get increasing distortion into the bass frequencies.

**Sonic Reviews**

Unlike the Alessandro-Grado tonality of the KSC75, however, which gives it the slightly muddy sound. Overall, though, it’s also that mid-bass hump combined with the recessed treble that results in these headphones being a nice unfatiguing laidback headphone.   

**Other Notes**

Most of the mods that exist for the KSC75 are also done for the PortaPros. You still see Kramer mods (which might be nice to bring out more of the treble), recabling, etc, etc.

**Will these benefit from an amplifier?** It's possible. Buy the headphones first and see if they are driven to a nice volume before going out to buy an amplifier.

###Superlux HD681

**Cost:** $35

**Pros:** Old school

**Cons:** Sound leakage b/c semi-open design. Very bright treble. Build feels a little cheapish.  Design stolen from AKG. Not portable.

**Voltage to 110dB SPL:** 1.10V at 34 ohm impedance (using the measurements from InnerFidelity)

**Links of Note:**

[Head-Fi Reviews](http://www.head-fi.org/products/superlux-hd-681)

[InnerFidelity Review](http://www.innerfidelity.com/content/superlux-hd-668b-and-hd-681-headphones)

[Hardcore HD681 modding @ Rock Grotto](http://www.rock-grotto.co.uk/HD681.pdf)

**Explanation**

Superlux is a Taiwanese company that is very good at stealing things from other headphone companies. They have a Sony MDR-V6 clone, Superlux has always brought some of the highest caliber sound quality for the price. The HD681 is the cheapest well-known Superlux headphone and it sounds very similar to the slightly more expensive HD668B.  Just because it is the least expensive Superlux of the well-known bunch doesn’t stop it from being a fine headphone.

**Measurements**

The Inner Fidelity measurements show a headphone that is surprisingly neutral. The highs are bright, there’s really not much else to say about the Superlux HD681 besides “look at how flat the frequency response is.”

**Sonic Reviews**

There is a reason why the  Superlux HD681 has gotten 5 stars on every single Head-Fi review. They are, the HTF600s, and the 8323s and really define their own bracket.

The bass is relatively tight and solid and you can definitely tell that it extends pretty deep. It was nice and quick, but the tightness and overall quality of the bass is nicer.

The mids are slightly forward and nice. The highs pick at the mids a bit
The highs are very bright and were too bright for me. It’s certainly shiny

**Other Notes**

As far as I know

#**.**

###Superlux HD668B/Samson SR850:

**Cost:** $50

**Pros:** More bass than the HD681. Removable cable.  Slightly more bassy than neutral. Nice soundstage.

**Cons:** Can warm up your ears and get hot. High clamping force. Low isolation. Emphasized treble. Feels cheap. Unfit for portable use.

**Voltage to 110dB SPL:** 1.81V at 65 ohm (from InnerFidelity numbers)

**Links of Note:**

[Headfonia Review](http://www.headfonia.com/superlux-hd668b/2/)

**Explanation**

This is probably the most well-known Superlux headphone. Since it was discovered

**Measurements**

[Here is a link to the InnerFidelity measurements of the HD668B.] (http://www.innerfidelity.com/images/SuperluxHD668B.pdf)

Looking purely at the frequency response

On a technical level

Another thing to note is the SHARP jump at 5khz that doesn’t exist in the HD681. This implies to me that there is likely a large ringing in the driver at this point that would show up in a waterfall CSD. Luckily

Personally speaking

**Sonic Reviews**

The HD668B is very similar to the HD681, but they have slightly different sound signatures and the HD668B has a removable cable. I personally consider those to be the two biggest differences between the HD681 and the HD668B.

1373945673.0,1ie0oc,A plebian's comparison and review of Audeze LCD2 &amp; Beyerdynamic T1,ohshitgorillas,51,4,16,"First of all
(home), TX, I had the opportunity to listen to and compare side by side Beyerdynamic T1 and Audeze LCD2.

This is my first review and I don't have plans for more

Edit: Music was played as uncompressed .WAV files from an iPad LOD into the Musical Fidelity M1HPAP DAC/amp.

**Comfort/Build Quality/Design**: Beyerdynamic wins this one with the phrase ""awesomely comfortable"". If asked whether I thought the HD598 or Beyers were more comfortable, however, I couldn't imagine having anything more than a one-song stand with them. I'm having trouble coming up with a metaphor for a gorgeous woman trying to suffocate my ears, but suffice to say that the clamping force was way high. (EDIT: Apparently, they become more comfortable after continued use. This doesn't surprise me as the T1s were probably used a bit more... I tried on fresh Beyer's at Guitar Center and they weren't nearly as comfortable, even though the earpads seem to have the same design.)

**Sound Quality and Attributes**:
**Audeze LCD2**: I've heard these headphones described as ""dark"" and kind of wondered what that meant until last weekend. Well, the mids and lows were just So Good. In three words, they sound precise, rich, and engaging. While the T1's seem to me more suited to live music because of their realistic presentation and soundstage, LCD2 is a pair that seems to really shine with well-produced studio work. This is no fault of the soundstage, which is very good, I found myself straining to hear Gillian Welch's higher guitar harmonies and Miles Davis' cymbals and such. Ultimately

**Beyerdynamic T1**: The high mids and treble of these guys are everything the LCD2 was not: highly detailed, beautiful and airy. Perfect, really, in so many ways. That being said, if these are your go-to headphones, you're the kind of guy whose ears were offended by the live cannons at your last performance of the Overture of 1812; you believe that subwoofers are for hip-hop hooligans and that 100 Hz is ""low enough"". This sentence is the first time you've read the word 'dubstep' and you will never listen to a single song with double bass drum kicks. I'm exaggerating, of course: these headphones have lows, like having a conversation with a nice Mormon fellow about the weather. Still

**Summary**: Enjoying such a large variety of music, but the idea of spending the cost of a flight to Hawaii or Europe on a pair of headphones is not something I want to do **twice**, just to cover all my bases. I used to think that these kinds of headphones have only tiny variations on a flat response, and that such subtleties would be lost on my plebian ears. I was wrong. I actually found the pairing of the T1 and LCD2 ironic, in that they have perfectly complimentary flaws. If I could give the engaging lows and rich mids and modern look of the LCD2 to the beautiful, delicate highs and the airy comfort of the T1, you'd have something I'd really start saving up for. In the end, I'll be putting my money away with something else in mind.

**TL;DR** When they're good, whereas T1 are too weak in the low end but delicate and beautiful and spacious in the highs.",,False,,t5_2rcyx,1374015001.0,,

1374826483.0,1j343s,3-Way Headphone Review (HD 650 vs HD 800 vs HE-500),CaptainDoubtful,45,5,28,"Hey guys. After nearly a month of extensive A/B comparative listening with the 3 headphones in my possession

Note that I was searching for the best one out of the three for me to keep

Headphone list and details:

* **Sennheiser HD 650** (650): stock cables/pads
* **Sennheiser HD 800** (800): stock cables/pads
* **HiFiMAN HE-500** (500): stock silver cables/velour pads

Amp list and details:

* **Little Dot MK III** (LD): OTL tube amp, purchased new 3 months ago (many hours on them)
* **Schiit Lyr** (Lyr): Hybrid amp, ~100 hours on tubes)

Source:

* **Creative X-Fi Titanium HD**: sound card
* **Schiit Bifrost**: DAC, RCA output to amps, purchased new 2 months ago (many hours on them)

Newest official drivers are used for the sound card, but mostly 320kbps MP3, 256kbps AAC, and FLAC.

I will begin with a surprising discovery that I made: the Lyr is not as good at driving the Sennheisers as the LD. This is something I did not know/expect until I A/B tested between the LD and the Lyr (I have a custom made high quality RCA spliter cable so I have both amps playing simultaneous for easy switching). The bass strength of the HD800s is slightly but noticeably weaker on the Lyr, but still noticeable). Initially I planned to do all my final comparisons of the headphones on the Lyr, but after this discovery I decided to mix up the pairings to get the best result possible for each of the headphones. So for this review, the 650s and 800s will be driven by the LD (on lowest gain setting), and the 500s will be driven by the Lyr.

**HD 650 (LD) vs HD 800 (LD)**

When I first heard the HD 800s I was not too impressed. The sound was much brighter than the 650, but I began to really like them. The clarity and detail of the 800 is absolutely amazing compared to the 650's smooth, muddy sound signature. The bass on the 650 hits quite a bit harder than the 800, which I think can be attributed to a number of reasons. The rolled off treble on the 650 definitely brings the bass forward, and the muddiness of the signature helps boost the impact (more rumble). The bass on the 800 is tighter, feels more controlled, and extends a bit lower than the 650. Some say the 800 has the ""right"" amount of bass, while maintaining its level of tightness and control.

The mids and treble is where the 800s shine. People spoke of the ""650 veil"", it literally felt like a fuzzy screen was lifted between my ears and the music. The 650's mids are very smooth, to the point where I think creamy would be the best word to describe it. It makes for a very laid back sound, but a lot of details are lost compared to the HD800. Instrument separation was much better on the 800, which becomes very apparent when there's a lot of things going on in the song (e.g. chorus of many songs). The 650's treble rolls off but the 800's does not, which can make the 800s sound bright, but not too bright or harsh in my opinion. I did not notice the infamous 6kHz/10kHz peak on my 800s, and possibly cause more fatigue. There were a few (very few) tracks that I tried which sounded a tad bit harsh on the 800s

The 650 has noticeably slower decay than the 800

The soundstage of the 800s is simply uncontested. Switching from the 800 to the 650 feels like I've put a box over my head. A lot of it is due to the driver positioning (angled on the 800) and the ear cup chamber (much better on the 800) I think

In summary:

* **Bass**: The 650's bass packs noticeably more punch than the 800's
* **Mids**: Veiled, clear, detailed but not harsh on the 800s. Much better instrument separation on the 800s, and much quicker decay
* **Treble**: The 650's treble is rolled off in comparison to the 800's
* **Soundstage**: Significantly more spacious sound on the 800s
* **My Verdict**: The 800s are much better overall than the 650s. Perhaps if you mainly listened to EDM or similar genres

**HD 800 (LD) vs HE-500 (Lyr)**

Since these headphones are being driven by different amps, since these headphones have different impedance and sensitivity levels (not a problem for 650 vs 800).

The 800 and the 500 are actually quite similar. I bought the 500 because from what I read/heard, with a subtle difference being that the 800's bass feels slightly thinner than the 500's, which had a bit more rumbling feeling. This difference is very subtle in fact that I don't even feel confident that I can tell them apart in a blind test.

The mids and treble on the two are also very similar. Both offer a lot detail and clarity, and that is the soundstage. The 800 has such a large soundstage compared to the 500 that it really trumps all other minor differences in their sound. Music sounds very close to the ears through the 500s, but on the 800s I feel more like I'm in a room listening to speakers (more natural).

There is a small difference in the sound of these two cans that I noticed which is a bit hard to describe. Certain sounds, and drums sound slightly more like a real drum rather than a recording of it. The difference is very small but definitely there, and I think it might be due to the nature of planar magnetic drivers - they have more uniform movement as the magnetic field acts relatively equally across the whole surface.

I'll talk about the amps for a bit. The 800 and the 500 both sound very good on the LD. When I received my Lyr, and the LD was not designed to drive low impedance orthos (it only outputs 100mW at 32Ohm). What was surprising to me was the reverse difference with the HD800. The bass, especially the deeper ones, did not quite hit it all the way on the Lyr, but had more strength on the LD. I was so shocked that I switched between the two amps repeatedly 20 or 30 times to make sure the difference was indeed there. I can say that it is very noticeable in certain tracks that I'm confident I can tell the two amps apart in a blind test. I'm not exactly sure what the cause is, as the Lyr clearly has more output power (even at 300Ohm) than the LD. Both amps drive both of these headphones very well though, but the LD has an edge over the Lyr on the 800

In summary:

* **Bass**: Extension and impact are nearly identical. The 800's bass seems slightly thinner compared to the 500's
* **Mids**: Very similar
* **Treble**: Very similar
* **Soundstage**: Significantly better soundstage on the 800s
* **My Verdict**: Both are very detailed

**HD 650 (LD) vs HE-500 (Lyr)**

Since the 500 is very similar to the 800

In terms of the soundstage

In summary:

* **Bass**: The 650s' bass hits harder and is more impactful than the 500s by a wide margin. The bass on the 500s is tighter and more focused
* **Mid**: Lots of detail and clarity on the 500s. The 650s have a very smooth texture
* **Treble**: The 650's treble is rolled off
* **Soundstage**: Similar
* **My Verdict**: I would go with the 500s over the 650s

**Comfort**

The 500s are quite heavy (almost double the weight of either one of the Senns). I found the stock headband to clamp a bit too tight on my head, the large ear cups could be uncomfortable). The 650s are very comfortable as well, but they clamp pretty tight (even after 3 years of use) compared to the 800s. I would say the HD800 is the most comfortable, followed by either the HE500 with the headband pad or the HD650.

**Conclusion**

In the end I chose the HD800 + LD as my main gear. The LD is definitely not doing the HD800s justice, and I'll leave some pictures here of the setups used in this review.

I plan to expand this subreddit to be the best it can be. I will do so by adding/improving a few aspects of this subreddit:

1. I will add flair that everyone can change or that has to be moderator approved. Not completely sure.
2. I will upgrade the sidebar.
3. I will add a good posting guideline.
4. I will try and start some different posting trends in this subreddit.
5. I will become a more active moderator. Meaning that I will be stricter on useless comments and circlejerks.
6. Lastly and most importantly, and try to further this subreddit in any way you can. If you have any specific issues with this subreddit or discourse in this subreddit message me or any of the other moderators. We are here to make /r/headphones as good as it can possibly be so *you* have a place to post. Thank you to those of you that already work hard to make this subreddit amazing and to those of you that will in the future.

In the coming week i will post a few threads on the specific details of every change I make with an explanation of how to best utilize these changes. Thanks for the advice and thanks for all of the help.

EDIT:: As a precursor to my future post I want to let you know that detrimental complaint will not be accepted. I am doing everything i can to try and stop the ""what headphones should i buy under $100"" posts. However i want all of you to realize that these posts wills still be their because the community is expanding. This expansion means an influx of people that are new to audio and are looking for an intro into this world. Please accept them and give them helpful information. If you have different opinions about these posts ignore them and go about your merry way. Now on the flip side start reporting posts with bad titles. In my guideline i will include a section that deals with submission template for help posts.",,t5_2rcyx,1339451525.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/headphones/comments/uwj4q/the_future_of_this_subreddit/

I brought the TMA-1 and while they sounded good for Netsky and other in your face DnB and dubstep

I bit the bullet and researched again for about 2 days. My criteria this time ignored the bass but went for a flat sound with a great sound stage and separation. The HD 598 and 558 were the 2 contenders and I wanted to save money and I know of the foam mod so I got 558.

Let me just say, the soundstage... oh my. For ambient music it sounds BEAUTIFUL! So happy with this headphones and I think I found THE pair. 

I see people saying ""no bass"" when reviewing these cans and people recommending them beats or XB, if you think having that bass is nescessary or that these cans won't have bass... wow they do, creamy as hell. I took the flat response wrongly I think.

Rating scale: 

5 - Spectacular.

4 - Very good.

3 - Could be better.

2 - Meh.

1 - Utter shit.

**Build Quality:**

Some may say that these are not well built, or at a wall or something.

**4/5**

**Comfort:**

Now

*L-CUSH* are essentially bowl-shaped pads that convert them from on-ear to over-ear 'phones. They are a little stiff at first, the housing will pin your ear to your head, but otherwise, they are very decent.

**4/5**

*Stock cushions* are very nice on-ear pads. Whilst they do get very hot very quickly, the heat would bring them down to a 3.

**4.5/5**

**Initial Impressions:**

At first, you will excitedly plug them in. You'll put on your favorite album. And what happens next? Frankly, you will be disappointed. **THIS WILL GO AWAY.** I cannot stress that enough. The highs will be too high, and the cymbals will be a bit static-y. In addition, the pads will be a tiny bit stiff. I promise, this will not last. 

**Hang in there— you didn't waste your money.**

Within an hour or two of continuous burn-in time, mids will be bright and warm, and the bass will be tight, and even give a bit of rattle if you play the right song. If you are thinking of getting a headphone amp; don't. You won't need it. I tested these with the following albums—

""The Hollow"" by Memphis May Fire

""Ground Dweller"" by Hands Like Houses

""If You Were A Movie

These albums absolutely sound brilliant with these on.

**4.5/5** (solely because of the mini heart attack you'll recieve)

**Overall** 

Get these headphones. They can do anything. (pictues will be added if requested)

**4.5/5**

**EDIT:** As some have pointed out, not for $1000+ pairs like the HD800's and the higher-end HiFiMAN models.",,False,,t5_2rcyx,1347481644.0,,

2. If the manufacturer you want to add a headphone for isn't in the list already

1364267376.0,1b0ppc,Mad Dog Review - First Review Attempt!,MoshingPanda,32,2,17,"Be gentle oh great audiophile wizards!  Attempting to get my vocabulary and baseline in order.  I've attempted to follow other review formats... I also learned that these headphones do not function on high gain as the O2 amp starts clipping.

**TL;DR** - Great fairly linear headphones that seem to reproduce tracks as recorded.  I went into this looking for something with clear, unfortunately.)  

For a person looking for an even sound, they sounded a bit dull but when I adjusted there were some tracks that I wanted to take it down a notch.  

9/10!  I think I'll only be able to get a better soundstage/signature by dropping twice the cost on another pair of open headphones.

**Setup** - O2 AMP (WAU16-400 tranformer), Mad Dog (Alpha Pads), FLAC audio

**Build Quality/Comfort** - Definitely feels like a solid pair of headphones.  I'm a bit wary of the hinges that connect the actual cans to the headband, but I feel that the stitching might need some love in a year or so.  The squishness of the pads are great and break in easily and will probably seal better as they form to my head.  The extra headband that Dan throws in under the standard Fostex one feels great and is a solid piece of leather.   The only thing that annoys me a bit is that the cables that connect to the headphones poke out so when I take them off my finger has a tendency to snag one accidentally which I'm sure will go away once I get used to them.   The clamping force on these is ideal: nice strong hug, not too soft and not cutting off circulation.

They are a weighty pair of cans

**Isolation** - The sound isolation is pretty good.  (Better than the AKG 550s that I tried).  Currently listening at a normal volume of a bass heavier song and the only thing I can hear is the gentle whirr of my desk fan and some people talking faintly if I focus in on it.   As for leaking sound, sound will start to leak out and your cube mate might be able to hear you.   When taking the headphones off, sound leakage is as expected.   With the sound on at a reasonable listening volume, it pretty much drowns out 95% off the open office space.  You will definitely be in your own world once you put these headphones on.  Cables are great and no sound issues to note.


**Sound** - Overall, small room I guess would be describe it, but they are sealed cans so that's expected and an necessary evil of working in an open office.   The detail on these headphones are fantastic and the bass is much tighter than my TripleFi10s (amped via the O2 with a Null Audio Lune cable.) with similar highs/mids, but a bit ""darker"" sounding.  However, compared against the TripleFi10s, the details far surpasses them.  (I might have to upgrade my TripleFis now...)   

Overall, IMO.

**Songs** - Linked with YouTube videos for reference.  I also tried to pick well mastered tracks for testing

**[Tool - Jambi](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNojdoI_D_M)** (Known for a bass heavy riff
Bass is fantastic and you can clearly distinguish an well enunciated bass guitar that is clearly separated from the drums.  The vocals are well separated from similar frequencies and sound great.  At 1:15, but I knew this coming in that these would be dark sounding headphones.  

**[Dengue Fever - One Thousand Tears of a Tarantula](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hy_7plOQvzA)**  (Cambodian psychedelic rock)
Guitar comes across as warm and smooth.  Bass is there and not overpowering and the highs aren't strident at all.  This track sounds a bit more claustrophobic for what I would like it to be mainly with the chanting/echoing vocals that come in around 2:20 or so as I imagine listening to this sound with a large sound stage.  No sibiliance to note.  I would like for the brass to come in a bit more

**[Glitch Mob - We Can Make The World Stop](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-k_Eg7zXuc)** - Bassy accompanied by a lot of mids and a smattering of highs.
Bass is great as usual and mids roll across.  The higher frequency ""sound fx"" come across as detailed and pleasant.  No wincing experienced like I had with the K550s.  Not much to note here since the track signature doesn't change too much.

**[Aloe Blacc - I Need A Dolla](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iR6oYX1D-0w)** - Vocals/piano in the mids
Brass sounds great with the soft bassline.   The bass does sometimes overtake the softness of the brass

**Eric Johnson - Cliffs of Dover/Manhattan**
Guitar sounds beautiful/crystal clear and with the way that it is mixed, Eric Johnson sounds fantastic on these cans.

1362505615.0,19pukh,First Headphones with no budget limitations,ribald86,34,6,53,"Howdy fellow headphone enthusiasts!

I'd like your opinion on some quality headphones

I began seeking higher quality audio out of necessity of apartment living and having a little old lady living below me. I recently began to invest in headphones for music/gaming. 

My music tastes are pretty simple. I enjoy almost every genre. I don't have many lossless audio files

Gaming wise

My first investment was the Astro A40 headset w/ amp. It was the biggest piece of shit I've ever bought. I was severely disappointed. My in-ear buds I purchased for a third of the cost sounded better.

I then began to do research
 
I am aware most audio enthusiasts stay the fuck away from ""gamer"" type audio solutions for good reason - more money is spent on marketing than R&amp;D. However

With no real budget limitations

Any advice will be appreciated :) 

**EDIT**

I feel sort of silly now. I suppose my budget for headphones is $3

I suppose another concern of mine is whether the nicer headphones will be lost on me if I don't consider myself a true audiophile (at least not yet anyway).


** EDIT 2 **

I got my ASUS Xonar One DAC hooked up. I do believe I a significant difference in my Audioengine 5 bookshelf speakers! However

I can't wait for the headphones! I'll probably wait till Apirl before I commit. I think Best Buy in my area has some mid range headphones I can try out. I'll keep this thread updated.

1332367565.0,r7el6,A non-audiophile look at HD-800 and Schiit Lyr,thehybridfrog,31,6,31,"This is meant to be a mini-review of two fine pieces of equipment I've acquired. I'm by no means an audiophile

http://imgur.com/ezenz

So about a year ago on the recommendation of a friend I got a Fiio-E7 and AKG-K701. I saw a few pictures of the K701 and fell in love with the aesthetics. A quick look online at a few reviews confirmed to me at least that I would like the neutral nature of the K701 as I listen to a ton of classical, and some pop music. Fast forward a few months and based on some strong reviews and recommendations on r/headphones I bought the HD-800 and a Fiio-E9. After being somewhat disappointed when comparing the HD-800 and the K701, I decided to get a better amp and acquired the Schiit Lyr, which I've been using for a few weeks together.

All of my music is either 320k Mp3 or FLAC and I'm currently still using the Fiio-e7 as a DAC. If I ever acquire music at a higher bitrate I'll probably jump to the Bifrost

First I'd like to comment on the difference between the E9 and the Lyr.  If you've never owned a good amp, it seems to be the norm so while I was concerned at first I no longer think about it at all. In terms of subjective audio quality the Lyr was definitely an improvement. I can't really describe the sound difference without using some typical audiophile babble but if you've ever played a stringed instrument, I almost felt like the Lyr had ""vibrato"" without actually vibrating strings. The low range on the Lyr was definitely more enhanced. If I had one complaint about the Fiio amps it's that at first the bass on both the K701 and HD-800 disappointed me greatly and that the highs on the K701 were sometimes shrill. The Lyr improved things on both fronts. Build quality wise the E9 had an annoying audible hiss when moving the volume pot. The Lyr on the other hand, looks like and is built like a tank.

When I first received the HD-800 I expected to plug it into the E9 and feel instant audio-nirvana, after roughly 6 ~~months~~weeks of using the HD-800 and contrasting it to the K701, DT-770, and DT-990, I can say for certain that the biggest win of the much more expensive cans is detail and clarity. If I really sat down and concentrated on nothing else (no reddit, no games, no books) but my music, the K701 would be 90% good enough. But if I decided to sit down and appreciate the music

So in conclusion, for anyone seeking to melt into their music, the HD-800 will blow your mind with its detail.

TLDR: HD-800 is awesome,False,,t5_2rcyx,True,,,t3_r7el6

I don't mind it this way but I'm worried that the headphones are not supposed to be like this and there is something wrong or defective about them. I did let them play all last night as an attempt to burn them in with the volume turned up relatively high (not to the point of distortion

Also, by no means am I an experienced audiophile as you can tell.)

**Pros:** Price to quality ratio, and build quality is sound. Strong mids and punchy mid-bass with clean highs.

**Cons:** Sub bass is lacking and comfort is nothing to brag about.

**Preferred Genres:** I’ve greatly enjoyed almost everything through these with the exception of most electronic music or deep bass focused tracks. Rock

**Amp:** Subtle changes through an amp are noted

**Listening Set-Up:** iPod Classic or Computer/ODAC/O2.

___________________________________________________________


**Packaging**

The Grado SR80i come in what many audio enthusiasts call the Grado Pizza Box. It’s simply a cardboard box with two small circular windows showing the cans. The box design is reminiscent of the 80s in style. The SR80i are protected by a styrofoam holder that fills the box. Included is a piece of paper with warranty information among some warnings. The SR80i are fitted with a 1/4th plug that pulls off to show the 1/8th plug. This is simple and efficient and it’s worked for Grado for years. 

**Build Quality and Design**

Much like the box, depending on your preference. One thing that can be said is that it’s minimal and efficient. The headband is simply a metal frame wrapped in leather, or a leather like substance, with no padding. The headband adjustors are held in place by the left and right indicators and slide up and down with enough resistance to prevent them from moving unintentionally. The cups of the SR80i are made of plastic with a black grill that has an SR80i button on it, the outside of the cup has the brand and line information. The pads are rather thick and cover the driver. They are a bit stiff and itchy, but they break in rather quickly without much discomfort. The cable comes from each ear and joins at a y-split. The cable is thick and inspires confidence of the build quality. 

The headphones are light and put only slight pressure on the top of the head. The pads are a bit itchy and hard which can cause discomfort, get a bit hot. In-fact the SR80i feel like closed headphones in that regard and it is due to the thick pad that covers the drivers unlike most open headphones that simply have a cloth in between the driver and ear, allowing for air to come in.

**Sound Quality**

I’ve been using the SR80i exclusively for the past two weeks

**TL:DR**
The SR80i have been highly recommended since they have been released due to their impressive sound to quality ratio. These have a clean and lively sound that is best described as mid and high focused with a touch of warmth from the mid-bass to balance these out nicely.

**Lows**
When people think of Grado the first thing that generally comes to mind is their mids and highs, there is no denying that. This makes the SR80i sub-optimal for bass heavy genres. Going up in the frequencies though, the SR80i are a very competant headphone. The mid bass adds a touch of warmth to the bright presentation of these headphones making these headphones more balanced than a lot of people give them credit for. The mid bass is punchy with good presence. The level of the bass is more than acceptable for rock music, or similar genres that have a focus on vocals and guitars. In-fact I think the amount of mid bass is near the perfect amount for many genres. 

**Mids &amp; Highs**
The mids and highs are the reason why people buy Grado. They are forward and clean while having a very natural sound throughout. Vocals and guitars shine through the SR80i, from horns to stringed instruments. The mids and highs are forward, this gives a more lively sound, music comes to life through the SR80i. I won’t wax poetic, I’ve said what needs to be said and that is that the mids and highs shine.

**Presentation**
Like the lows, in-fact the SR80i remind me of seeing a venue in a small square shaped room. Positioning is decent though, it’s not impossible to pinpoint where things are coming from despite the small soundstage, but it isn’t as easy as a headphone like the Audio Technica Ad2000.

**Conclusion**

Despite the shortcomings of the SR80i they have become one of my favorite headphones. Musicality is the word that comes to mind when describing the SR80i. I don’t think about the details of the music, this is a standard price anywhere you go, and it is more than a fair price for these. I put these on par with any other companies offerings in the same price range from Sennheiser to Audio Technica. These are an excellent value, even at $100 and anyone looking for a first set of headphones would be more than satisfied with these.

Fit/Comfort: After reading many reviews from all across the internet, and as people's opinion of their head size can be a little subjective I thought that would be helpful. I will say at first it can feel a bit foreign, but after wearing them for 2-3 hours today on the maiden voyage I must say they were quite comfortable. The pads only felt the slightest bit stiff initially, but still provided great isolation. As they are brand new, that's as stiff as they'll ever be, so I'm going to go ahead and say no issues there.

A note on the wings: There is a way to disassemble the wing mechanism, but don't feel right posting it here without being able to give the right person credit. PM me for the instructions if that interests you.


Build quality: No complaints here, and they do seem quite well made. They're light enough to be comfortable but heavy enough to maintain a solid structure and premium feel. The nylon (I think) wrapped cord keeps it from getting tangled or caught on your skin, and is a very nice touch. It's plenty long, 3 meters I believe.


Sound: I wouldn't consider myself an Audiophile any more that I would consider myself a wine snob. While I have a deep appreciation for both sound and wine, I'll update this post with my findings regarding a break-in period and how/if the sound changes for me. 
With all that out of the way, both devices were able to adequately power my new friends, though I do intend to buy a headphone amp in the future for my home theater setup (suggestions are welcome, I'm still researching those). I spend most of my time with these at my computer, and that is the basis for the following. I found the sound to be wonderfully balanced, so much so that I had the equalizer pulled up on my computer expecting to play around, but after twenty minutes I still couldn't bring myself to move anything and just left it flat. As you may have read elsewhere, but in no way is the bass from these underrepresented. The warm, which I was also considering and had a chance to try. It's just a whole new level of clarity. The highs were a bit sharp for the first hour or two

Something you should prepare for in your first few usages is the new smell, as it's strong enough to be nearly noxious in a small area that isn't well ventilated. After several uses though, it was aired out enough and remedied. 

Putting them on was a welcomed experience, the scariest part was now over. The default 3.5mm connector is the most sturdy part of the ensemble, a classy industrial looking peice that connects to almost any outlet with no hassle, except of course an iPhone with a case, no problem with my handy dandy extender cable. The 1/4"" connector is included with a simple screw on design that makes it both semipermanent, for those who use only that connection type, and quickly removable.  A great feature that I found admirable was a spring on the base of the plug that relieves stress on the cable; I really take my hat off to Audiotechnica for this, it really shouldn't be tampered with as it can come loose without too much effort

No headphone is perfect, the cups fold up toward the headband to make them about the size of a nerf football. The carrying case is a joke, just a cheap pleather case that literally must have cost them nothing to produce, it's blatantly obvious Audiotechnica included it only as a loyalty to standards. The cups are big, but not overwhelmingly so, just enough to give your ears enough room inside. The ear pads are made of a synthetic material, I've seen them beat up before on an old pair with no sign of cracking or peeling, personally I feel breaking them in makes them more comfortable. Your entire ear should be engulfed in either side, breaking them in fixes most of these problems and clamping force can be reduced by placing them on a shoe box the first few nights while you play pink static on high volume. After burning them in
The head band has just enough padding, and like I stated earlier, can be fashioned for wearability with only one ear covered. 

My first song was Clock Catcher by Flying Lotus on his album Cosmogramma, I couldn't stop myself from grinning. I had never heard all parts of a song come together as they did from the m50's, so well balanced and all encompassing, I understood at that moment what studio headphones were.
I don't want to sound like an idiot from the masses who buy Dre Beats because it's the first time they've heard bass from a headphone. The bass from these are deep and resonating, I can't think of anything I would rather spend $160 on, with no hyperbole I feel it to be one of the most satisfying purchases I've made on anything. The mid ranges, such as vocals, have a unique effect of sounding further away from the rest of what you're listening to. I was a bit thrown off by this and didn't know what to think, but after wearing them for awhile I found it useful as it let me focus more easily on either characteristic of music. One of the only things I didn't find likable were the medium highs, which can sound tinny and somewhat piercing at times; don't let that aspect cause you to lose hope though as every other quality of these cans outshine it. The worst part of picking out headphones, is the comfort factor; I cannot enjoy the sound coming from a headset if I can't enjoy the feeling of the set themselves, needless to say I was very displeased with them, a bit of metal

If you haven't heard studio headphones before, with one purpose, pure performance. They have an impedance of around 40 ohms, so they can easily perform to their maximum capabilities on a mobile phone. It was disconcerting how loud these were on my iPhones maximum volume, they could easily blow your ear drums or permanently damage your hearing with short use, which is why I always have my volume limit set. The isolation is at about -9db which is satisfactory, the ear pads create a solid seal and listening to anything at all makes regular ambient noise disappear.
If you are still getting used to high quality cans and don't feel like spending hundreds of dollars on HD 600's or Denon 5000's, backups, for travel; they are an essential stepping stone for anyone serious about sound and having them will only improve your life.

1376416612.0,1kainf,VModa M100 and Sennheiser Momentum Comparison,shazzam6999,29,8,22,"Disclaimer: Things will be spelled wrong

So I recently acquired a pair of VModa M100s to compliment my Sennheiser Momentums. I believe these headphones are two of the primary competitors when people look at purchasing over-ear headphones in the $300 range so I hope this comparison will be useful. I've had the oppurtunity to listen to the Momentums for hundreds of hours as they've been my primary travelling headphones for the past six months

**Sound**

Both headphones sound good, the treble is relaxing and the bass is prominent in a punchy sort of way. As far as isolation goes the Momentums seem spectacular. I work in a library and our third floor is the designated quiet area. I've spent quite a bit of time up there and no one has said anything. Conversely, I spend a lot of time riding public buses with drunk college kids and my iPhone easily powers the Momentums to levels where I can't hear them. My Schiit Modi DAC was a nice improvement on the sound of the Momentums, adding a bit of improved clarity to the mids without negatively affecting the sound signature. Overall the detail on the Momentums seems to me very precise and what ultimately matters is that I really enjoy the signature of the Momentums.

The VModa M100s are not as precise. The treble is relaxing again and the bass is powerful, I can clearly hear the music from the cans when the volume is around mid to high; however, the M100s get louder than the Momentums and from a listener perspective I still can't hear shit going on around me. One thing I really disliked about the M100s was that plugged into my Modi the bass was terrible. The mids were greatly improved, but the bass went from powerful to disappointing, but this might just be something I need to play around with in my computer settings. Overall the M100s are a fun pair of cans, especially if you enjoy hip-hop.

**Appearance**

Both pairs of cans look spectacular in their own way. The Momentums look very refined and classy. The leather is beautiful and the steel headband adds to the refined look. I originally purchased the Momentums over the M100s almost entirely based on the appearance.

As for the M100s, but still something I'm not ashamed to wear around town. The option for custom shields also adds to the appearance appeal for the M100s.

**Durability** 

The M100s are built like tanks. The images I saw online of them made them look slightly flimsy and worried me. In person they're quite durable. The best way I have of putting it is that I'm not afraid to shove them in my backpack. The M100s squish into a neat little package that easily fits into small spaces. Finally

The Momentums look fragile but after six months with them I can confirm that they are beasts. Again, in thunderstorms and hail. The only concern I have is that the cable is beginning to chip a little where it connects to my phone and for some reason Sennheiser wants $80 for a replacement three-button cable (although I can't find the replacement site now). The other problem with the Momentums is that they don't compact at all like the M100s, as a result, they take up almost twice as much storage space. 

**Comfort (holy shit

Comfort on both cans is something I see people complain about frequently; however, but after a few hours my ears just prefer the M100s. Comfort in headphones is always really subjective, for these cans it seems to come down to whether or not the cans rest on your ears, or over them. If the headphones fit over your ears I don't think comfort is going to be in issue, if they end up on your ears I could see it being a massive problem. The good news is that Sennheiser just realized a pair of Momentums targetted as on-ear, and VModa is looking to release their XL pads, which look amazing

**Overall**

I really enjoy both headphones. If I had to recommend one pair I would recommend the M100s for anyone who listens to primarily rap

Equipment:
Roughly half the listening was done between my iPhone 4s and whatever God awful sound card my computer motherboard has (the motherboard is a GIGABYTE GA-Z77X-UD5H I believe). I did test the Schiit Modi for a bit on both cans

Highlights: 

M100s: Run the Jewels

Momentums: Daft Punk Random Access Memories

If you have any specific questions or feel I left out something big (which is entirely possible) let me know.

1371531192.0,1gkfaq,Review of Bottlehead Crack (for wiki),BaksideAttak,26,3,5,"This post is just for the wiki. I just noticed a 'reviews' section and figured I would write what I know about the two amplifiers I own

This review will include impressions with the Sennheiser HD 650.

I will offer my impressions of the speedball upgrade kid, and other miscellaneous upgrades.

**Information**

The [Bottlehead Crack](http://www.bottlehead.com/store.php/products/crack-otl-headphone-amplifier-kit) is a pure tube amplifier created and sold by Bottlehead Corporation. It has no solid state in the signal amplification path. The Crack is a relatively inexpensive pure tube amplifier, but most recommend over 300ohms). It is a notoriously good pairing with Sennheiser's higher-end headphones, most notably the HD 650 and HD 800.

You must build the Bottlehead Crack - it is only available as a DIY project (with the exception of Ebay). It is

* Soldering iron
* Solder (recommend a eutectic solder)
* Multimeter 
* Phillips-head screwdrivers (small ones

Everything else required to build the Crack is included in the kit. The kit comes with alder wood sides, or left as-is. You can also create your own custom housing for the amplifier.

The folks over at Bottlehead are very nice and responsive to email and phone. Note that the Crack is from a small company and can take some time to ship. Mine took approximately 4 weeks. This could change as the Crack becomes more and more popular.

The Crack can also be ordered with the [Speedball constant current kit](http://www.bottlehead.com/store.php/products/speedball-upgrade-for-crack-amplifier). The speedball is a great upgrade for the input tube

**Build Impressions**

Like I have mentioned, as I had never soldered before. It was a lot of fun and definitely worth the time.

The Crack base is as well-built as you make it. I wood glued the base together overnight with angle clamps to ensure proper angle and compression. I suggest placing the top plate onto its groove before letting the glue dry to ensure proper fit.

The construction itself is very rugged. The parts are held into the top plate via machine screws and nuts. Just attach them firmly and you'll be fine.

The nice thing about the Crack is it is mostly point-to-point soldering (with the exception of the speedball upgrade)

**Sound Impressions**

The Crack certainly has the typical tube amp sound. It brings forward thick, and highs.

*Lows*
The lows change a lot depending on the tube configuration you have. But I'll describe the stock tubes. The bass is weightier with the stock 6080A than a solid state amp. It sounds fuller, however.

*Mids*
The mids really stand out with this amplifier. Everything is thick, and melodic. Midbass is a little pronounced, giving the music a deep and involving feel. This actually reminded me a little of the ATH-M50s. Depending on the tube you put in, the mids can be resounding, sort of like being in a concert hall. Male voices sound deep and melodic, and female voices sound smooth and soothing. You definitely lose some crispness and cleanness as a tradeoff for the musicality in comparison to solid state.

*Highs*
Tube amps roll off highs. Cymbals change from a ""cschh"" to a ""schh, more comfortable and non-fatiguing sound. It's great for things like soft rock and more laid-back music, but for cymbal-heavy metal you may find it lacking. Once again, you can alter this with tube composition. I personally like my highs a little crisper than the stock tube configuration, as I listen to a lot of progressive metal.

**Tubes**
So the best thing about tube amps is... tubes! You can replace two tubes in the Crack - the input tube (stock is 12AU7A), though most people would say the input tube affects it more so.

Tubes can be sort of thought of as little equalizers that do more than boost frequencies. They may very well increase bass, soundstage, impact, airiness, and musicality of the music. So it's a supercharged equalizer that has the ability to make music sound completely different - hence people describing tube amps as ""colored.""

For input tubes on the stock amp (without speedball)

* 12AU7
* ECC82 / E82CC
* ECC802
* 7316 / CV4003
* Others

With the speedball's double heater current

For the driver tubes

* 5998 (most common)
* 6AS7G
* 6N13
* 6H13C
* 7236

Different tubes provide substantially different characteristics to sound. I will highlight those that I've owned:

* 12AU7A - stock driver tube. It's a good tube; it has punchy mids and mid-bass with average treble. It's pretty standard and nothing special.
* 12BH7A - ""Upgraded"" 12AU7. It sounds richer, but bass is a little bit more forward than a 12AU7.
* E82CC - I accidentally bought a Telefunken E82CC (won an auction with a ridiculously low bid, NOS), but it really brings the mids forward. It also adds a lot of instrument separation and much increased musicality. Treble is crisper than a 12AU7, and bass it a little punchier. Overall, this tube is much more musical than the others and is notorious for being so.
* 6080A - Stock power tube. It's pretty plain
* 6AS7G - An upgrade over the stock tube. It brings out the mids a lot
* 6080wb - I got 2 Bendix 6080wb tubes with slotted plates recently. It's a pretty rare and expensive tube, and separated with a great midbass punch. Guitars sound excellent. Treble is a little less rolled off than the normal 6080 and much less rolled off than the 6AS7G, so cymbals are a little more lifelike and crisper. Overall, a *great* tube for rock.

The great thing about the Crack is that you can tailor the sound to your preference. Like heavy lows? Grab a 6080wb. Like relaxed mids? Grab a 5998. Like soft and fluid musicality? Grab a 6AS7G.

**Speedball upgrade kit**

The [speedball](http://www.bottlehead.com/store.php/products/speedball-upgrade-for-crack-amplifier) constant current upgrade kit is an excellent upgrade for the Crack. It made an **enormous** difference in the sound of the amp. Everything was more musical, and involving. The background was darker and the foreground was cleaner and clearer. It also gives you the ability to add a greater variety of input tubes into the Crack. Another thing to know is that tube rolling is more pronounced when you have a speedball kit in your Crack. That is to say that each tube will sound more characteristic with a speedball.

I *highly* recommend purchasing a speedball kit with your Crack

**Summary**

The Bottlehead Crack is a DIY amplifier that gives you a great ""tube sound."" It rolls of highs, full nature to your music. Lows are weighty and plentiful, though the stock tubes may not be as punchy as a solid state amplifier. Compared to a solid state, music is more involving and simply more musical, whereas solid state is more analytical and dry (dare I say boring!). The two tubes can be swapped (so-called ""tube rolling"") for other tubes that can drastically affect the sound of music, making the amp colored. That being said, you can increase what you like to hear in music and decrease what you don't.

**Edit 2:** [Results here](http://www.reddit.com/r/audiophile/comments/1eyono/survey_results_highres_vs_lossless/)

Well

Can you hear the difference between a 24/88.2 ""Studio master"" lossless edition of a song

This is something I said I would do in the [thread about the HDTracks version of ""Random Access Memories""](http://www.reddit.com/r/audiophile/comments/1et48i/daft_punks_ram_from_hd_tracks_2488_version/).  Note that it took me some time from when I first decided that I wanted to test, I had to search for a candidate clip of about 30 seconds, and I also wanted to find the right candidate, which took about 50 complete listens of the album.

I've prepared two clips of the intro to ""Lose Yourself to Dance"":

1. One from the [high-res version you can buy on HDTracks or Qobuz](http://www.discogs.com/Daft-Punk-Random-Access-Memories-%C3%89dition-Studio-Masters/release/4581717). This file is originally in 24/88 format
2. … and one from the Mastered for iTunes version

I've then prepared a Google survey that basically seeks the answer to one question: ""Which clip do you prefer, and your system settings. Note that you should only fill in the survey once.

* [Google survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1BVXFR4FLdKw8KpB6vPu2g5c5dcxfK8nwTpCsNt7GWQM/viewform)
* [Test files](http://www.mediafire.com/download/i15jzh46pza5nip/lossy-vs-lossless.zip) (25.5 MB zip) - [Mirror 1](http://media.veven.org/2013/05/lossy-vs-lossless.zip)


I'll keep the survey open until I have a reasonable number of responses, and merely asking you to subjectively tell which clip you prefer - it could take as little as five minutes, or as much time as you personally like to spend on it.

**When and how I got into the headphone hobby:**

I started caring about sound quality about 3 years ago when I was a high school student. The first expensive headphone I heard was a Monster Beats by Dre in an Apple Store. I was blown away by what I thought was amazing sound quality. I began to research headphones then bought my first headphones

1375064290.0,1j91jh,Monoprice 8323 (Hi-Fi Pro DJ Headphones) Review,SanjiWatsuki,21,2,1,"Hey

Early in my headphone career, tape, and acoustic foam to see what I could do about these headphones. 

**Introduction**

The Monoprice 8323 are a $20-30 headphone that is often suggested as one of the best headphones in its price range. It is possibly the only sub-$30 headphone with a removable cable.

**Setup**

ODAC -&gt; O2 -&gt; Monoprice 8323.

Very overkill for the headphone

**Build Quality and Comfort**

These are not an exceptionally comfortable headphone at stock. My ears almost seem to press against the plastic of the baffle. It's mildly annoying for small periods of time

Although I commend Monoprice for having a removable cable at this price range, the other broke his after it tumbled off his table and he was left with only one ear piece connected. I have accidentally broken a cable on my 8323 while on the go when it got caught on a chair, however, so I will attest that it is a great feature.

Despite this

**Review**

Stock

The mids on the 8323 were rather forward. They were not quite as forward as the HTF600 or the Koss Pro DJ 100s, making the vocals seem almost dulled around the edges. 

The sub-bass was rather significantly rolled off, rather than the leaner punchy bass.

This overall balance with the thumpy bass and the odd lower-treble made the sound very thick. Instrument separation was difficult because of the very thick sound. 

The soundstage was nothing to write home about. It wasn't exceptionally poor

**Mods Tried**

**Cotton behind the driver (1 and 2 layer)**

This emphasized the upper-treble even more. The treble was unbearable in songs like Queen's Old Fashioned Lover Boy. 

**Electrical tape over vents**

After taping up the vents

**Electrical tape over entire baffle**

The sibilance issues returned. It seems that if you're taping to try and reduce resonances

**Silverstone Acoustic Foam behind driver**

This seemed to have cleaned up the sound a bit. The upper-treble was emphasized even more, but less apparent.

**Brainwav HM5 pads**

These pads fit nicely onto the headphone without any tape or O-ring modding. The comfort was significantly better

I also attempted the HM5 pads with the cotton

I also attempted the HM5s with the cotton and the tape mod. The sibilance issue wasn't as bad

**Acoustic foam + electrical tape over vents**

With stock pads, but it doesn't solve the bass issues or the high-mid issues.

With the HM5s

In the end

**Conclusion** 

I still am a firm believer even after modding that the 8323 is not the best sounding headphone for the money. I'd go with the Brainwavz HM3 (AKA Incipio Forte F38), and JVC HA-S400B all over the Monoprice 8323 for fidelity. That said, they aren't WORLDS behind, but I think the high-mids issue is enough to knock it down below them. 

There is a definite issue with the the high-mids in my opinion -- a quick EQ to add 7-8dB to around 3.3khz relative to the rest of the spectrum really evens out the sound for me. I also prefer a leaner bass than the 8323's bass

I do believe that they are more balanced than the other budget headphones

Overall, cheap headphone that you can toss into a bag and take out on the go without feeling too bad about potentially breaking it. ",,False,,t5_2rcyx,False,,

**-Source:** I plan on getting an amp at some point when my budget allows it (within the year)

**-Isolation:** Not a requirement - this will be in home use only - I have a pair of crap IEMs for the gym and travel

**-Preferred Type:** Full size/Over the ear are the most comfortable

**-Tonal Balance:** I am definitely a basshead when it comes to the type of music I enjoy listening to the most

**-Past Headphones:** AKG K 26 P. I bought them because my roommate had them and I loved the bass. I bought a pair of my own and loved them until the headband broke. I fixed them several times until the copper broke at several places in the line as well and I gave up. I liked the heaphones overall

**-Preferred Music:** I listen to pretty much everything except for modern country - eg Mozart, The Beetles, Muse, Streetlight Manifesto, Britney Spears, Carnage, Flux Pavillion, Movie/Game OSTs. Again though

I've done some browsing  and really like the Sennheiser HD 600, but they are at the maximum of my price limit.  I would feel a little buyer's remorse going that high, but music/sound is important to me so I can rationalize the cost.

If there are any other suggestions/advice/comments I would love to hear them before I take the plunge.

I'm a heavy PC Gamer and also a games journalist. I've been mildly content with my Razer Megalodons for about 6 months now until I realised that I was *putting* up with them because it was the easy thing to do. I'll admit the whole ""7.1 surround sound and external sound card"" reeled me in

Now I want rid of them

**Budget**

I wouldn't like to spend any more than £250 on a headset/headphone

That being said

**Usage**

I'm a PC Gamer, which has an annoying tendency to spill sound out and onto my microphone while playing. I think I'd rather go for immersion above anything else, so maybe a closed design would suit me? 

Also because I play games, A decent mic is a must. This is why I have included Headsets in this post, primarily because they seem the most suited. However, I have heard that they are limited to what Headphones can achieve. If it's something I'm missing out on I want to know, I don't mind venturing into it and buying say an external mic like a Blue Yeti or Snowball.

I have rarely used the visualised 7.1 surround sound the Megalodons offer, so maybe keeping it as an option would be nice. But I would love a great sense of positional audio for games such as FPS's and mainly Horror games. 

**What do you listen to?**

Everything

I've been perusing a number of different web locales dedicated to quality headphones, as I'm sure many of you are familiar with. 

Although these are a relatively humble pair of cans from what I've seen, and tinny laptop speakers. I dismissed the misgivings of the few audiophiles I ran into, thinking I heard my music just fine, that I didn't need to spend hundreds of dollars on equipment that would somehow improve the quality of my listening experience.

As the title suggests, and played Radiohead's ""Paranoid Android"", I was *blown the fuck away.* I heard Thom Yorke like I've never heard him, he was so fucking raw and beautiful. I heard noises I've never heard before, and I heard the ones I'm familiar with in a completely different way. I am in the process of re-discovering all of my music, and I am cherishing ever blessed second of it. Every cymbal crash, every lyric, I've already started to choke up a few times just re-hearing the songs that I thought I loved just the way they were coming out of ipod earbuds.

So

TL:DR Sennheisers are re-invigorating my life and my balls.

**Budget** - I'd like to spend around $150-200 but I can go up to $250 (and would be willing to for both quality and good design)

**Source** - I'll mostly be using them to listen from a computer (at home/work).

**Requirements for isolation** - Sound isolation is fairly important to me

**Preferred type of headphone** - Over ear or on ear

**Preferred tonal balance** - I like bass but I also don't want something *too* powerful or thumping. I liked the bass of the Klipsch Image One headphones but after listening to more balanced pairs (like the B&amp;W P3s) it was overwhelming. 

**Past headphones** - I haven't owned an on-ear pair in several years

Etymotic Hf5 - Good: noise isolation and overall sound quality (as well as the design and size). Bad: Not good for bass heavy music
Shure SE215 - Good: noise isolation and overall sound quality
Shure SE315 - Really underwhelming. I expected a lot more for the price (and the fact I've liked Shure headphones at other price points) and I'm hoping to avoid another underwhelming pair at this price point

**1) Style/Looks

These headphones are massive

**2) Comfort

This was an important factor for me as I spend a lot of time working and travelling with my headphones on.  My prior set squeezed a lot and would give me a headache after a few hours use so I made sure to do a lot of research and there seemed to be unanimous praise for the DT770's comfort.  Did they live up to the praise? Oh hell yes!  Even though these bitches are huge, however, have a tendency to make me sweat a bit and this might effect others more or less than me (I generally don't sweat much).

** 3) Build Quality

I was actually quite surprised to find that the headband is constructed of solid metal which makes them look and feel very solid.  The rest of unit are constructed of hard, it sounds like a tiny plastic ball-bearing that I'm hoping to get out in some way.

** 4) How does it sound?!

This is where I'm going to show my novice stripes as I really don't have much to compare it to.  So far my testing has been limited to a number of different sources on my laptop; these sources have been Spotify (high-quality stream subscriber)

Streaming from Spotify is sort of hit and miss... I subscribe to Spotify so I have a high-quality stream

My MP3 collection fared a lot better than Spotify

It was extremely obvious if I came across any mp3 with a bitrate lower than 160kbps as the headphones allowed me to clearly hear the compression artifacts and muddle missing portions of the song.  This is actually a good thing and allows me to appreciate the quality of these headphones more.

With my MP3 collection I literally feel like I'm surrounded by the music and everything sounds natural and not forced or processed.  And with these headphones enveloping my head so well

So really overall the sound quality is fantastic

I'm a little bummed out about the Spotify stream however I'll probably pick up an E6 or E11 portable amp and hope that gives me a touch more oomph.

** 5) Portability

This was a minor concern of mine

** Conclusion

So would I recommend the DT770's? Hell yeah I would

I'll try and update after a couple hundred hours of usage and trying it on other devices like my phone or ipod and let you know how they sound... and if I grab an amp I'll be sure to update!

So thanks for listening

UPDATE: I plugged it in to my Droid Charge (w/ voodoo sound) and fired up Spotify and it sounds night and day better than on my laptop.  I'm fairly certain the phones driver is pitiful so it must be the voodoo sound giving it a bit of a kick.

What do you think is the price point when tube amps start to shine

How big of a difference do the different tubes make?  How often do you replace yours and does it depend on the type/model of the tube or the amp it's plugged into?

Heat?  I have a class A amp



EDIT:
Another question!  What is the effect of mixing tubes?  I'm assuming it depends on the design of the amp

And a follow-up to the difference in tubes question.  What about the differences in the amps themselves?  Do the amps act primarily as the vessels for the distorting tubes and it would be hard to tell the difference (relatively) between two amps?  I guess the question is how much of the distortion could be attributed to the amp?

The [JDS Labs Objective2 Amplifier](http://www.jdslabs.com/item.php?fetchitem=O2Full) is a long-time low price standard for solid state amplifiers. It was designed by [NwAvGuy

This amplifier can be purchased built from [JDS Labs](http://www.jdslabs.com/item.php?fetchitem=O2Full) in the US or [Epiphany Acoustics](http://epiphany-acoustics.co.uk/products-page/headphone-amplifiers/ehp-o2-portable-headphone-amplifier/) in the UK. There are other manufacturers and modifiers of the O2

You can also build an O2 yourself using NwAvGuy's blog. There are hundreds of resources available. You can purchase parts from Mouser to do this

**Build Impressions**

The build of the O2 is controversial. The JDS Labs O2 is very rugged piece of hardware. It has a milled aluminum housing with a machined faceplate. It has two depressible buttons - one is the power, allowing for multiple gain configurations (1x, 2.5x, 6.5x, whatever you set it to). The volume knob from JDS Labs is aluminum with two rubber rings for grip that functions normally and feels good to turn. The O2 takes a 1/8"" (3.5mm) jack as an input and has another 1/8"" (3.5mm) jack as an output. The power supply is not included. The O2 requires a ~14V and 200mA power supply, which can be purchased from JDS Labs or Mouser. The O2 comes with 2 9V batteries, giving about 6 hours of battery life as a ""portable"" amplifier.

The major downside of the JDS Labs O2 is that all of the connectors are in the front of the amplifier. Yes, output, volume knob, gain switch, and input. 

Additionally, replace the batteries, and thus it can only be used with a power supply.

**Sound impressions**

This amplifier was used and tested on Sennheiser HD 650s

The O2 is very much a ""gain on a wire"" amplifier. Sound is accurately represented with near zero distortion. It provides sufficient power for *most* headphones, but I can explain changes to the HD 650 and M50 sound.

HD 650s, but not optimal, for these headphones. They become louder, as you'd expect, but also gain bass control and volume. The bass becomes clearer and more impactful. Mids become slightly fuller, but not by too much. Treble is clear as a bell, though still recessed (because they're HD 650s after all). That said, they will stay that way! Same can be said with bass. Bass *mostly gains control and clarity

The M50s change very little with amplification by the O2, I couldn't tell a difference in mids and treble with and without an O2.

**Summary**

Overall, it offers reliable, time-tested performance, gain switching, and the ability to add an ODAC into the same housing. Downsides include all ports being on the front of the module and its price relative to the Magni.

I would recommend getting an O2 for people looking for a good price/performance ratio for low-mid to mid-tier headphones. I recommend it or a comparable amplifier for the following headphones:

* Sennheiser HD 598
* Sennheiser HD 600
* Sennheiser HD 650 (if you want a boring amp... I'm biased toward tubes)
* Beyerdynamic DT-880
* Beyerdynamic DT-990
* AKG K701/K702/Q701
* HiFiMan HE-300
* HiFiMan HE-400
* Any headphones with similar power requirements (i.e. most within the range of $200 - $500)

1371438715.0,1ghpop,Review: Sennheiser HD 600 with a HE-400 &amp; HD 598 Comparison,BananasApeUnicorn,23,8,12,"I have also posted this to Head-Fi


Here's my thoughts on the HD 600. During the review, but still remember how they sounded on certain songs and if I don't feel comfortable about any statements towards them I simply won't post them.  


**Build Quality/Design/Comfort (3.75/5):** These are really comfortable, the plastic doesn't feel very cheap, but to me they don't look or feel like a $400 headphone in your hands.

 
**Lows (4/5):** The bass has good power at the mid-bass area, like the song ""E"" by Drunkenmunky. I would say the HD 600's bass is adequate, it never wowed me with power and speed, but it didn't sound anemic or very slow either. It did well with Trap, rap, and dubstep showing good extension and moderate power but it doesn't exaggerate the bass which makes those genres enjoyable to some. Comparing the HE-400 I actually think the HD 600 has more perceivable bass in most songs, because of it's stronger mid-bass which you hear more in music, I simply felt the HD 600 had just a touch more quantity wise.

 
**Mids (5/5):** The mid-range is less forward then the HD 598 making the 600 a bit easier to listen to without fatigue. The mid-range is smooth, even with new velour pads.
 

**Highs (4/5):** The treble in this headphone lacks some detail and excitement. The treble is not veiled, this will probably be a 5/5 for you. If you want a more dynamic sound with excitement, you should probably look elsewhere. I think the treble was less bright and fatiguing then the HD 598 and HE-400.
 

**Soundstage (3.75/5):** The soundstage has a good size to it but it doesn't always give you that out of your head sound with some headphones. This is kind of a good thing, not only in width but also in height. I listened to ""Kitchen Sink, Boxcutters remix"" by Amon Tobin and I could tell the song sounded smaller on the HD 600 while the 598 was larger. I can not comment on the HE-400 because I don't feel comfortable with my memory regarding soundstage on them.
 

**Amping &amp; Synergy:** The HD 600 is a bit harder to drive then your average headphone but it scales incredibly well. It sounded good out of my phone, but I noticed the treble was more relaxed and less sharp, plus the bass had increased power.

 
**Final thoughts:** The HD 600 is a great headphone that can handle almost all genres. It has a smooth and relaxing signature that I personally love. You will need to look elsewhere if you want a fun and more dynamic experience,False,,t5_2rcyx,False,,,t3_1ghpop

1369895848.0,1fbmum,because nearly every post is asking for advice I thought I'd do a mini review: AKG K240S,grunyonz,21,6,13,"Thought I might share my opinion in case somebody was looking into these headphones and nearly everything on this subreddit is people asking for help or talking about M50's (hehe).  
Firstly I'm using an ODAC into an O2 and FLAC files.  

I just received these cans three or so days ago

Straight away I was pleasantly surprised


After I put them back on I put my first test song on, then when her voice comes in it shows how cans perform with treble and then as the bass comes in it shows how cans handle the bass and how they handle a lot of content happening at once.  I can usually tell within the first 30 seconds of listening to this song if I will like a headphone or not (treble is important!).  I was really surprised with these headphones, the guitars sounded awesome having nice top end while still retaining some body, and when Adele started singing I knew these cans were good, the treble and high-freq content does not feel limited or rolled off at all (except it has no 'air', i.e. no super high frequency content) and sound extremely life-like with her voice, being able to hear every little rasp in her voice is quite an intimate experience (oh God what am I writing haha), also when everything is happening in the song these cans handle it well

Basically these cans sound like a slightly less detailed AKG K702 with more warmth, although I probably wouldn't trust these as a predominant mixing/producing headphone.  They're somewhat comparable to a poor-mans HD600, giving a very speaker-like representation but still being able to give treble when it is there (this means shit recordings will still sound shit).  I think I might be rambling on and I really have no idea where this review was going.
**EDIT** I've been listening to some more tracks with these
Listening to ""Feeling Good"" by Michael Buble is really really impressive.  the mids are sublime
Nirvana sounds really nice through these.  
Even listening to ""Still Grey"" by Pendulum through these is really nice, the snares hats and crashes can get a bit painful with the V6).
I decided to try to listen to some Michael Hedges through these as I'm used to listening to him with my K702's and HD600's, for somebody just getting into it or even somebody with more expensive 'better' cans it is really hard not to be impressed by them.


**TL;DR:** Ever wondered about the 'AKG Mids' or 'AKG house sound'? TRY THESE. They're excellent headphones for the money and a good stepping stone to those who want to see what less than $100 can get them in the way of sound quality.  They compete with my better headphones

The ES10's essentially replace my ATH-ES7's and the venerated ATH-M50's, and the M50's as a hotel-travel portable. I liked the sound of the M50's more, but I thought they looked too stupid on me for daily public use. The ES10's are now my all-purpose portable set.

First let's focus on one of the main reasons most people would buy these guys: the looks. I must say all my fears of looking stupid are gone. These babies look even better on someone's head then they do on their own. Nice and flat against the head

Comfort is as expected

Build quality is acceptable for the price

Isolation is in between my two previous pairs: less than M-50's

Sound quality: Take this with a grain of salt, less up-front presentation. Clarity and separation are definitely better than the ES7's, and slightly ahead of the M50's. Bass is deep and controlled, but bassheads may want more impact and quantity. They are not bass-shy by any means, but coming from the ES7's they definitely have less bass. **9/10**

Value: Are they worth the price? If the M50's look better on you than they do on me, then probably not. The two are close enough in performance that unless you can get the ES10's for less than $250, I'd recommend the M50's for 90% of people. But for those who want to show up the beats crew, have a little extra coin, and want to eek out a bit more quality sound out of their portable headphones, then the ES10's fit the bill. I am definitely keeping them. **6/10**",,,,

Am I missing any contenders?  Comments on the list so far?  Appreciate any advice.

edit: added AKG K 550

**update 3-Jul-2012:**

Lots of good ideas and comments in this thread.  I really appreciate everyone who is contributing. 

I jumped the gun and bought the AKG K550s.  Why?  After tons of reading, I wanted to avoid the ""but what if I spent $100 more???"" line of thinking, and just went for the AKGs.  (Standard irrational consumer thinking.)  The others weren't available in town without ordering, and I'm impatient, so here we are :)

I haven't broken them in, and the K550s seem more at that level -- or beyond; way better lows already obvious.  (Using my Grados at work wasn't an option since they are noisy as hell for anyone nearby.)

First impressions vs old Sonys:

* With music off
* sound stage!
* highs / detail!
* ear cup padding is extremely soft and nice

I will break in the K550s for 24 hours or so and post an update later if anyone cares.

**update 17-Jul-2012:**

I have at least 24 hours on these now.  I don't notice much difference from when I first got them.  They still sound incredible and am still really happy with the purchase.  I will say agian that they isolate really well

1371593864.0,1gm5kg,My Review of the LFF Paradox,zowki,17,4,16,"(Posting here to add to the headphone wiki)

The LFF Paradox is a modified Fostex T50RP with the aim of sounding completely neutral and costs $495 from LFF's [official website](http://referencesounds.com/paradox.html).

I love my Paradox. I've owned them for 6 months so far (received them on December 2012). They are my favorite headphones of all time. LFF

**Stock T50RP Sound**

My memory of the stock Fostex T50RP sound is very vague. I didn't listen to it for very long since the sole purpose of buying stock T50RPs was to get them modded into a Paradox. What I did remember is that it had a mid-centric sound with no peaks. However it lacked extension in the treble and bass.

**LFF Paradox Sound**

When I received the Paradox I initially thought they had too little bass and the mids sounded dry. However after about 2 weeks I stopped going back to my Fostex TH900s and listened to the Paradox exclusively. I just needed to get used to the neutral sound after only owning colored headphones in the past. 6 months later and the Paradox never fails to satisfy.

The sound is neutral from top to bottom with only a slight increase in the lower midrange which isn't unpleasant (makes vocals sound warmer). The midrange sounds incredibly detailed and realistic, the drivers can push air and deliver rumbling sub-bass when the recording calls for it. The treble is perfect. It extends effortlessly and has the perfect level of emphasis, very smooth with no peaks. The soundstage is the best I've heard out of any closed headphone. Not quite as good as most open headphones but still VERY good. There were many times where I had to check if the sound was coming out of my speakers, no joke. The Paradox sounds amazing with any kind of music I throw at it. It presents music the way it was meant to be heard without introducing any coloration or distortions given that you use a transparent amp (I recommend the O2/ODAC). The Paradox is good for evaluating source equipment as they sound transparent.

I've owned a few other top of the line headphones in the past (Fostex TH900 and LCD2) and the Paradox beats them both. TH900 had too much treble and the bass was bloated. LCD2 had far too little treble but was otherwise pretty good.

**Durability**

The Paradox is fairly durable and can take some abuse. I've knocked them off my desk a few times and squeezed them into my tight backpack without them getting crushed or deformed. The T50RP was designed to be a professional headphone used in recording studios so no surprise there.

**Leakage and Isolation**

Sound isolation is ok. Not enough for trains and buses but ok for places with small amounts of background noise like a restaurant and park.

Sound leakage is similar to something like the Audio-Technica M50s. It does leak a bit. If you're in a silent room and listening at moderate volume levels

**Amp/DAC pairing**

The LFF Paradox is best paired with the O2/ODAC combo. It provides a neutral and transparent sound with a huge volume headroom. I personally use a Leckerton UHA-6S.MKII since I wanted USB charging and a pocket sized form factor. The sound of the UHA-6S.MKII is pretty much the same as the O2/ODAC except it can't go as loud. It's not much of a problem except for very high dynamic range recordings.

You can use the Paradox straight out of an iPhone/iPod but the volume is going to be rather limiting

**Comfort**

I purchased a third party headband pad to improve comfort which can be purchased from [Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/Replacement-Leatherette-Universal-Sennheiser-Beyerdynamic/dp/B00862522A) and [eBay](http://www.ebay.com/itm/Headband-Cushion-Comfort-pad-fit-GRADO-SR60-i-SR80-i-SR125-i-SR225-i-Headphones-/190702643884). It is a good alternative to the suspension headband if you don't want the headband shaking around when you are walking. You will need to stretch the headband pad significantly to fit it on the Paradox/T50RP. Don't worry about breaking the headband pad from stretching

Comfort is very good with the headband pad mentioned above or the suspension headband. Comfort is not as good as the Fostex TH900s and Denon D5000s but good enough for me to wear all day without complaints. Using the stock headband without padding or suspension headband causes discomfort after about an hour

**Conclusion**

The LFF Paradox is the best closed headphone on the market if you strive for neutrality,299).

  Setup: Computer -&gt; Hotaudio Dac Destroyer -&gt; Magni -&gt; x



**SR60i**: Very uncomfortable for extended usage until Reverse quarter modded Senn HD414 pad + Beyer replacement headband. 
Very good for rock and single instrument music(ie. Piano/Violin solo). Little light on bass. Vocals jump out over everything else (due to protruding mids).    
   


**K271 MKII**: Originally for the office and replaced by K550. Fairly comfortable for extended usage with velour pad.
Sounds pretty neutral with slightly recessed mids. I would have to say it sounds veiled and distant.


**DT990 Pro**: To be honest
Pronounced highs were prone to frequent sibilance. Bass was tight and controlled. Not very good for vocal music.



**AD700**: Very comfortable and light on the head. Sometimes
Neutral and good separation of instruments. Clear mids and highs but a bit muddled lows. Great for orchestral music.



**K550**: Very comfortable but sometimes headband gets a bit pressuring at the top. 
Very neutral. Unlike K271
  
  
  
Personal preference: K550 &gt;= AD700 &gt; SR60i &gt; DT990 Pro &gt; K271 MKII

Upon looking at pictures on the web, but the real unsettling part was that the images had ""Made in Austria"" printed by the chord plug. Mine had nothing printed there, but instead I have ""Made in China"" printed on a small sticker on the inside of the headband.

EDIT: So, and just me overreacting and being paranoid. The poor photoshopping was unnerving, but I guess it could be justified. The materials probably only looked different due to lighting.

EDIT 2: Okay

* [Here](http://i.imgur.com/HEyY6.jpg) is my headset. My primary concern is the fact that it was made in China, with the ""Made in Austria"" mark missing. Here are two pictures [1](http://i.imgur.com/CeEvD.jpg) and [2](http://i.imgur.com/9fTSw.jpg), 1 being of the headset laying so as to show the sticker, and 2 is up close, reading ""Made in China P.R.C."".
* I mentioned the leather ""not lining up"", you see the edge of the leathery fabric covering the ear pads. In 4, I have stretched that edge a bit back. When I opened the box, this edge was stuck to the plastic, streached back half a cm or so, on both sides. This made it look as though it had been sloppily assembled. However, after wearing it for a bit, and now it lines up as seen in 3.
* I should note that in the above pictures
* The buildquality itself was another of my worries. I bought the Sony MDR V6 in addition to these, and they actually felt like a hundred dollars.That is, I could feel that they were wourth my money from their weight and the materials. However I am only an aspiring audiophile, and so I am not able to discerne quality from sound alone just yet, but from what I can tell my AKGs do not feel like a hundred dollars. The leather is not real, though it looks like it from pictures on the net, and it does not feel very durable. The casing is made of light plastic, and again not at all like the impressions I get from internet pictures. This doesn't mean anything ofcourse

So yeah, which i hope should clear everything up.

If there was one thing I could change, i'm new to this), but it does look awfully goofy! I don't really care that much about the way they look though.

Bottom line: If you are considering the 8323's as your first set of decent sounding headphones,,False,,t5_2rcyx,False,,True

    Frequency response (-10 dB referred to 1kHz) - 8 Hz - 25kHz
    Sound pressure level - 102 db and 113 dB / 1 V rms

**Question 1** - Would the fiiO e6 be beneficial for my set-up?


**Question 2** - Would the cMoyBB v2.03 Headphone Amplifier be a better choice?


**Question 3** - What's the benefit of connecting to my iPhone via 30-pin dock connector vs. the 3.5 mini jack?


**Question 4** - What would a DAC do for me and my listening experience?


**Question 5** (somewhat unrelated) - I'm just using iTunes with the default file format to listen to music. Could someone point me to an article or online post regarding the best way to ""upgrade"" my files and/or player?


**Set-up** - Listening to music ***via my 3GS iPhone*** or MBP while working on the computer at a noisy coffee shop or a quiet library. Type of music is everything under the sun.


**Notes** - I read somewhere that the voltage of the e6 isn't sufficient for higher impedance headphones... but then I read somewhere else that the e6 doesn't really add anything to the iPhone/MBP.... but then I read even elsewhere my iPhone can't push the 280s enough or to their intended baseline (my phrase - hope it makes sense).

The two main IEM's that i've been considering are the SE215 and the RE400

SE215: I looooove the build on this guy, the appearence, the around the ear style, all of it.  But i'm not too sure if it's going to give me a huge upgrade in sound quality over the UE500. The signature seems very similar, with a marked bass emphasis and a rolled off treble. I do like bass, but i'm looking for a much more detailed and balanced sound than I've had from my previous IEM's.

RE400: Basically the opposite concern, although it won't be the primary usage, so their ability to stay in the ear while running is something i'd like some input on. Also I've heard the SE215 has better isolation, which isn't hugely important to me, as long as the RE400 isolates *enough*. 

Also microphonics. I *hate* microphonics. The UE500 is probably one of the least microphonic IEM's i've had. (Maybe its flat cable has something to do with it)

So if anyone here has experience with either of these IEM's, or the microphonics of either of them, it would be greatly appreciated. Also, if you have any other IEM's to suggest around the $100 range, that's awesome too. ",,False,t5_2rcyx,True

Second, the part where the air rushes into your ear and pounds your ear drums, and after a while gives you a headache part.

Garage1217 design these so that they have a variety of different sounds that they put out so I'll do this review as far as how the amp sounds with a certain set of tubes and a certain set of headphones instead of a generic one so that it doesn't come off as if this amp only has one sound because it doesn't -- the tube has a massive effect on sound and I feel that to do an amp review without also treating it as a tube review wouldn't be an accurate indication of the amps sound. 

First will be the RCA Clear top 12AU7 with Fostex T50RPs modded to BMF spec (minus felt over the drivers and treble reflector). 

Treble - Great extension - with this tube in the amp is pretty bright. Not harsh at all. Cymbals come out well in a hot sense but not fatiguing.

Mids - This is where most of the emphasis is on this setup. Vocals are pretty aggressively prioritized to the extent that they dominate the sound sig if if they weren't totally killed during mixing of the song. Mids are on the brighter end of things but are super smooth which them a treat too listen to. Guitars cut through when necessary and the tube does a great job at creating a wall of sound effect when necessary.

Bass - Not exactly the tube for a basshead. Its there

Detail/Soundstage - Terrific at it on all accounts. Soundstage is massive and even on closed headphones with a smaller one

Powering abilities - The amp puts out almost a watt and it shows in that it drives hard to drive headphones such as Fostex T50RPs post modding and AKG K702s very effectively. I know that other amps can do it volume wise but not as effective as this does because the extra power adds more bass response and detail.

Just one sidenote - this is an amp that you'll want to keep away from a tv or things like that - its open design makes it someone sensitive to RFI. Computers

EDIT: Also I have a decent amount of headphones and tubes so this is going to continue kinda like a series of reviews if you will.

Sennheiser HD650 (old black silk membrane version)

Impression on the Denon:

**Build quality**

Pretty good, scratch prone plastic cups. 

Denon do have good build otherwise

**Comfort**

Amazing.

It's not the earpads - they're not as soft as the velour pads on the HD650 and DT770 Pro 80

When people say it feels like it's going to fall off when you shake your head too fast - it's 100% true. But I'm not using these portably and I love the light force on my head

**Sound**

Very very fun/exciting pair of headphones.

Even going from memory

However it's that sibilance combined with the much bigger soundstage that makes it feels way more hi-definition than the old DT770

Compared to the HD650, where each instrument come from a much more distinctive direction.

Problem with the Denon is that they're much more fatiguing than the HD650

Yes, this leads to me turning up the volume to hear the vocals better but which compounds the tiring sibilance.

I'm probably going to try EQing on the computer to see if I can get them to sound better. They're not bad as they are though

As a 15 year old, and is (was) what I'd consider an audiophile. He definitely knows his stuff when he talks about audio, but his ears aren't what I expect they used to be. He's satisfied with Pandora streaming through his blackberry on his car stereo. It's painful for me to listen to. Pandora's compression techniques absolutely **ruin** the highs, and his car's stereo is boomy regardless of the input. I tell you this to explain that my primary source of audio knowledge and experience is no longer adequate. I hope you at /r/headphones will save me.

In my room, and few other sets that I've heard can compare. My dad has a speaker set in our living room paired with Arcam products. Those speakers are Ruark Crusaders. They're fantastic as well, but they're not used often.

As a teenager, which means I can't be loud with my speakers when I want to be. I've had to turn down the volume to a point where it is nearly unenjoyable to listen to my music at night, and would like to end this compromise. A year back, before my ears raised their standards, I bought a pair of Sennheiser HD202's. Today, I found them, and put them on. It was terrible. *Of Monsters and Men* was just bad to listen to. The sound is beyond my description (I'm 15, and I **need** an upgrade. 

I'd like to spend under $100, but I need second opinions. And third opinions. And fourth opinions. You get the idea. Last time I bought headphones, I regretted it (HD202). I'd not like to make that same mistake again.

**Here are my requirements and uses.**

* Comfort is a must. I'm not looking for ear-buds.

* I'd like there to be little audio ""leakage"". I don't want my sound getting out. I don't mind if it gets in.

* I **DON'T** want boomy headphones. Boominess is one of the reasons I find the HD202's unacceptable.

* I **DON'T** want tinny headphones. Shrill sound is difficult to listen to for long periods of time.

* I'd like to spend under $100. $120 is my limit. If there is a marginally better product for $150

* I'll be using these plugged into my computer. It uses a standard 3.5mm headphone jack. If I were to plug this into my stereo

* Cord length must be greater than three feet

**Here are the music genre's I'll be listening to.**

* Rock (from Woodstock to 2012)

* Metal (not death-metal

* Folk (similar to folk

* Blues (Clapton-like blues)

* Raggea (only sometimes)

* Piano

I listen to a lot. Pandora (on the desktop, and dubstep.

I'll be cross posting this to /r/audiophile in hope for more responses. Thank you all in advance! I'll be posting some of my other questions separately

1376107176.0,1k2lb7,Magni vs the O2 and Results of ABX Testing,RAZRr1275,18,4,10,"Hey

So apparently I was lying a while back when I said that I wouldn't do a blind abx test. To back this up a bit


As far as our method goes, and ODAC) except the Magni and O2. Then we started abx testing in two methods. For both methods, we took 30 seconds of listening in which we knew which amp we were listening to based on verbal confirmation (before this we had only spent about 15 minutes on each other's amps). After that, we  started blind testing and left the song playing pulling out the headphone cable between each declaration of an answer until 10 answers were recorded. For the first test, after each pull out of the cable at which either a change or no change could occur, we had to name which was the Magni and which was the O2 based on the 30 second preview that we had. Both of us got between 4 and 6 correct in each of our 3 sets of 10 trials. For the second method (fourth set of 10 trials), we simply had to declare if the amplifier switched. I scored a 9 out of 10 correct and my friend scored a 4 out of 10 correct. 

I'm sure you're saying at this point that because the results of the blind abx were inconclusive, we guessed correctly that there was a change, but got confused on which was the O2 and which was the Magni. The other thing that we noticed was what exactly we were listening for was different -- after we finished abxing we debriefed as far as what in the tracks we were listening to for the giveaways of which was which. For a certain track, one of us would say vocals and the other bass kick or one of us guitars and the other piano. Upon re-listening to the track without commenting on which differences we heard, we were able to understand where we had gone wrong. On some tracks there was no difference between the vocal presentation, but there was in the bass and vice-versa. The other problem that we noticed with abxing is the mental pressure aspect. The idea that there could be no change (and the subsequent desire to not look like an idiot by getting it wrong) created a scenario in which the test was not necessarily about what was being heard -- it was about the game being played. I had many times in the test where I detected a change or no change -- and then the second guessing started. Would he really put a no change there? Would he really switch? Once the doubt in what you heard becomes apparent, the awfulness of auditory memory shows up and you begin to invent differences all in the name of not of the inherent desire to not want to look as if your ears are inferior in terms of detecting differences.  It's equivalent to taking a scantron test and noticing that every single correct answer is A except you aren't detecting differences on something reliable like knowing a fact. We found that with sighted listening, we were better able to focus on differences in general sound signature and individual details at the same time instead of attempting to focus on mind games and sound at the same time. 

So without further hesitation

1) The O2 has a much cleaner presentation as far as detail retrieval

2) On certain songs

3) The Magni's vocals almost have a veiled warm and thick quality while the O2s were somewhat brighter

4) The O2 has more sparkle on instruments such as guitars and piano
 
5) The O2 has a better soundstage as far as width and better placement of things within the soundstage

Feel free to comment/critique away. I would just like to ask that if you desire to downvote

I recently bought the mdr-nc200d noise canceling headphones. I did not understand that they choose their own level of canceling. Train

Here is the issue. My office is mostly quiet. I share a large room with two people who are fairly new. I am too

They stopped all but the phone calls about 2 weeks ago when they started getting angry at coworker 2 for yawning and burping loudly. They had mentioned the yawning before (didn't find it bad then) but things recently got very excessive. I'd estimate coworker 2 burps loudly followed by a loud groan 3-5 times in 30 minutes (often in succession)

This Monday coworker 1 got upset enough to start burping several times in retaliation

The extra irony is I think coworker 2 started using headphones to drown out coworker 1 and is now less aware of his noises (also drumming the desk).

So anyway I don't think the headset is detecting the right atmosphere since I have to push a button for resetting the mode and what I want canceled out is infrequent and brief enough to not be feasible.

Is there something short of earplugs that can give me piece? I sometimes listen to audiobooks (music distracts me

While writing that last paragraph coworker 2 burped, then yawned again. No manager is likely to hear this enough to act, due to reasons relocating is unlikely, none of us will be gone soon.

I'd be willing to drop 200$ on the new headphones or more if it's needed but prefer not to break the bank. Ideally I'd enjoy it sounding like I was 6ft under the ground. I do not care about aesthetics,False,,t5_2rcyx,False,,,t3_1jvzzy

1371728299.0,1gpzbg,My opinion on Beyerdynamic T1 vs. AKG K701,derbigpr,14,2,8,"So, HD598, DT880 600

Sure, 90% of K701 quality), but it never happened and I always ended up selling those headphones. 

There's just something about K701's:  detail, speed, dynamics, great presence and liveliness, excellent extension in both directions and reasonably neutral frequency response with a slight brightness to it.  Those are all positives as far as sound goes, and no other headphone mentioned beforehand beat them as a combination of all these attributes. Oh, sure, bass comes to mind first

Well, without ever even seeing them in person, let alone hearing them. My liking of all other Beyers was the only quarantee that I was doing the right move.

So...they've been here for a week now.  My setup is not ideal. It's currently just a Nuforce HDP dac/amp, 24/192's and SACD's.


T1 and HDP...well...it does sound good, never have to turn all the way or past 70% to get really loud. However, for a headphone that came out in 2009, and costs almost 1500$ in my country, compared to a headphone that came out long ago, and costs 350$ in comparison, they're surprisingly (and rather disappointingly close).  Sure, they have a bit more bass

 But, they beat them in presence and liveliness, and probably in detail presentation. They're not MORE detailed, they just throw detail in your face.

 

So... are the T1's worth almost 5 times more? In my opinion, and its a bottleneck not allowing them to show their best, but the fact they get beaten by K701, and clearly so, in ANY way, is an amazing testament to the quality of todays mid-tier headphones. I know that I'm not getting a full potential out of them with only the HDP. BUT, look at it this way:

HDP ($500) + K701 ($350)  vs.  HDP($500) + T1 (1500$). 

The cheaper combo is definitely not inferior in any way, if I was blindfolded, and had no clue which headphones I'm about to listen to, and someone changed these two while playing the same music, I would come up with two conclusions.  Number one, I prefer the K701 and I think it sounds more ""hi-fi"" and more enjoyable. Ok, this is personal, I'd probably think the other headphone is a DT880, they still won't completely outclass the K701

And I doubt that they will improve a lot. I've heard people talk about HD650's as if they turn into a monster once you used them with a high end amp and source. Well, Lehmann BCL, etc...there was an improvement, but not nearly as dramatic as expected. So,  I think I have a right to believe T1's won't completely transform either, and unless they do, they're simply not worth a step above DT880/990 or HD600/650 or K701/2


I am not saying T1's are bad, for a much lower price. To put it in car terms....I always though that going from DT880 to T1 would be like going from BMW 3 series to a BMW 7 series. Well, in reality its more like going from a 330i to a 335i.

1357167452.0,15uow0,K702 vs Denon D2000 Shootout,RAZRr1275,12,1,11,"This is unfinished and I doubt I will finish it but I wanted to post this since I know some of you wanted to know more about the k702s. Alas

Denon D2000 with FIIO E7/E9 vs AKG K702 with Little Dot I+ and Voshkod EF95 Tube/OPA2134 opamp Shootout

*Disclaimer -I know this is unorthodox because there are a bunch of different variables but I thought it would be interesting to have a full setup shootout instead of just an headphone or equipment one. The reason for this method is that I feel like certain headphones have certain amp preferences to sound their best so it would be unfair to put the headphones against each other on a source that would disadvantage them from the get go so these are two of the best setups that I can provide for these headphones. My reasoning behind the setups is that I feel that the AKGs are too cold to use a solid state in order to sound best and that the tubes provide nice warmth and the Voshkods in particular because they are warm but very detailed. An OPA2134 was used due to its clarity and separation. The hybrid design of the little dot adds to the bass enough to make it contend. Denons on a solid state because they are very musical and warm but I feel that they come off as less detailed and a tad muddled with tubes and need the solid state to tighten them up a bit as well as to bring out the mids. 

Disclaimer #2 - At the end I'll name a ""winner"" based on which setup wins the most songs. I do understand that this may be influenced by song choice but I'm going to try to keep it as balanced as possible. Also impressions were done so that I wrote while the headphone in question was playing and named a winner based on a combination of which notes I took sounded better for the most part and memory to fill in the gaps because I want to rely on memory as little as possible as it can be more distorted than spur of the moment impressions. I did not supply ratings in stars or points as exactly what the scale means may entail different things for different people. I figured simply writing impressions would be more imformative. 

Disclaimer#3  - Don't stop reading after the first chunk of songs and think I'm a basshead and thus that this is unfair. I  just can't listen to bassy music late at night if I plan on sleeping. 

This shootout will be divided into sections based on genres 

Section 1 - Hip-Hop and Electronic

Song #1 - Survival of the Fittest by Mobb Deep

Denon - Loads and loads of bass here. It really captures the dirty feel of the song well due to the more forward less soundstagey presentation. Clean vocals. It takes this round. 

AKG - Close contender. The bassline had less impact although it was tighter which hurts the feel of the song a bit. It just sounds less gritty which fits the style better. The soundstage does make the hook sound better as it provides a presentation that puts it at the extreme left and right while the bassline goes in the center which is interesting.

Winner: Denon D2000

Song #2 - Strobe by Deadmau5

AKG - Absolutely insane. Things are going on everywhere due to the massive soundstage and there is no shortage of bass kick and subbass when necessary. It really showcases the things that I love most about this headphone namely its ability to layer different parts together as well as present sound in a way that different things occupy entirely different spaces so it feels like things are playing in different pockets of space so to speak. They also have a very large amount of snap on the clap sounds which I find very awesome. The sparkle in the melody is also amazing. 

Denons - Good - As expected bass presence is greater with this setup which makes it very fun in its own right. A much closer together presentation which I feel does a disadvantage to this song because one of its best qualities is its ability to entrance the listener through the way that it uses soundstage. In addition the claps could use more emphasis. 

Winner: AKG K702

Song #3 F**k S**t Stack  Reggie Watts

Denons - As usual the strength here is its ability to extend and the impact that the beatboxing has in this case. It sounds better than other songs mentioned such as the Deadmau5 song because the impact occurs lower in the frequency spectrum than clap sounds. This song doesn't use a particularly massive soundstage so I don't find its presentation style to be a big deal at all.

AKG K702 - Less impact than the denons. Vocals slightly more forward. Small sections which do use an expansive soundstage sounds better. 

Winner Denon D2000

Song #4 - Harlem Streets by Immortal Technique

Denon D2000 - Absolutely terrific. Subbass is very prominent

AKG K702 - Absolutely terrific in its own right. Tighter than the Denons presentation

Winner: Very very slight edge to the K702 for its clarity and separation

Song #5 - How To Be Eaten By A Woman by The Glitch Mob

AKG K702 - Super super clean. Synth is amazing here not because of its rattle but because of the fact that the soundstage works great with the exaggerated presentation that that they use. Very good separation and the parts that should kick do it fairly well. Subass is lacking a bit. 

Denon D2000 - This song doesn't particularly need a massive soundstage so that's not a problem. What soundstage it does have it uses effectively. Synth has more impact and rattle to it which makes it a fair amount better here. In addition the more full way that these headphones present drum sounds gives it an edge.
 
Winner - Denon D2000

Song #6 - Germany to Germany by Ratatat

Denon D2000 - This song really shows what these headphones do best especially during the fade in intro which is go from a thinner sound when necessary to a full on wall of sound which it is necessary. Synth sounds wonderful and full and even on the FIIO which has a relatively cold opamp in it in the OPA2134 it still sounds very warm and musical. As expected bass is terrific and the extension is wonderful. 

AKG K702 - Massive soundstage which creates a wall of sound in its own right as Ratatat really uses all of the space available. Cleaner

Winner AKG K702

Song #7 - 2 of Amerikaz Most Wanted - 2pac and Snoop Dogg

AKG K702 - Nice separation

Denon D2000 - This one is going to surprise a bunch of you - I prefer the lower bass stuff on the akgs here as I think its much tighter which works better with the way the riff is designed which is that there is a bit of space in between synth bursts that the akgs communicate better. Doesn't extend much lower than the akgs at all. Less snappy and smaller soundstage. Vocals are more recessed on the Denons

Winner AKG K702

Section 1 Score - AKG K702 4 Denon D200 3

Section 2 - Rock (Includes Alternative, Punk, Ska-Punk, Black Metal etc just for efficiencies sake)

Song#1 - Schism by Tool

AKG K702 - Bass riff comes out well in the intro

Denons - Uhhh wow. The musicality that these have really complements tools sound. The guitars have more crunch than harsh edge which I prefer a lot better on this recording. Drums have a more full and less distant impact than the akgs which really helps out the way that they sound. The darker presentation also works really well for the Tools gritty

Winner: Denon D2000

Song #2 - Laid to Rest by Lamb of God

Denon D2000 - This is fricken insane. The guitar attacks relentlessly

AKG K702s - Great

Winner: Denon D2000

Song#3 - New Noise by Refused

AKG K702s - Sound nice but that's the problem. I didn't get slammed nearly enough on the guitar entries or the short chord punches during this song. The screams sounded very nice and the song detailed but I need agressiveness on a song like this and the AKGs just didn't have enough. 

Denon D2000 - Much more aggressive than the AKGs which makes the loud sections as well as the off kilter guitar riff  have a more powerful effect. Screams sound more aggressive too and this just has a more forward feel to it which works great with punk. Bass kicks also have more punch which is very nice 

Winner: Denon D2000

Song #4 - Sell Out by Reel Big Fish

Denon D2000 - Horns are very strong which sounds great

AKG K702 - Upstrokes come out cleaner on this setup, sounds smoother an energetic. 

Winner AKG K702

Song #4 - Point/Counterpoint by Streetlight Manifesto

AKG K702 - Acoustic in the intro sounds great. Vocals are awesome very forward

Denons - Sounds pretty energetic

Winner AKG K702

Pros: Good bass
Cons: Not the best sound for other genres other than electronic music

Just got these headphones a couple of hours ago

And since this is my first review, especially because I'm not really familiar with all the terms smile.gif

First things first: I bought these for their ""fun"" sound, detailed, balanced sound you can find, specially in this price range. That being said... let's start. I separate this review in:

1. Design / Build / Comfort

2. Sound

3. Accessories

4. Value

5. Conclusion


**1. Design / Build / Comfort**

As most of you should know

As for the build, that feels like a tank and looks like a tank).

Comfort-wise, and while they don't ""disappear"" on my head, I feel I can go on using them for a longer time (and I haven't even bent the headband to loose the clamping force a bit).


**2. Sound**

Well, and they're not very clear and detailed. But for electronic music (drum and bass, dubstep, house...), they're really ""musical"" and fun!

I'll admit I was expecting more from the sound, and I realised for the reason I bought these cans, they're really worth it! The bass is impressive, mids and highs are a bit muffled but they're still quite clear considering the amount of bass.

Unfortunately, and even lowering thru EQ, the mids and highs are not as clear as in other headphones, like the HD 25-1. So, to my ears, the LP2 is really tuned for bass-heavy electronic music (and by tuned, I mean in a fun way

Listening to this track house (http://soundcloud.com/frenchexpress/malinchak-if-u-got-it), considering the bass amount).

To sum up, and I'd even say it's like a club sound around your ears (considering one goes to a club to have a good time, not really analyze the soundsystem biggrin.gif).


**3. Accessories**

Wow! Accessories! A nice case, small cloth for cleaning the shields, 1/4"" adapter... after getting the DT-660 and finding only a pair of headphones and a 1/4"" adapter inside the box, opening the LP2 box felt like Christmas when I was child!


**4. Value**

This is the most subjective part of the review... I wanted a pair of around-ear headphones, club-like sound (I listen to a lot of electronic music).

For this reason, but I wouldn't say they're expensive either (I got them new for 164 EUR at Amazon).

Are there better-sounding cans in this price range? Sure... I have the HD 25-1 II, they're not as fun and engaging as the LP2 can be.


**5. Conclusion**

I'm really happy with my purchase. I was quite worried due to the high amount of bad reviews

If you're searching for a pair of good-looking, with a fun, bass-heavy sound to listen to electronic music, you should consider the LP2. And then, forget about technicalities and just enjoy the music basshead.gif",,False,t5_2rcyx,True

**Headphone type**- I'd prefer full sized headphones. I'll be wearing them for hours on end so comfort is a must.

**Tonal Balance**- I listen to a wide variety of music so I require balance. I do play games so good bass (though not overpowering) is important.

**Past headphones**- My current pair are Sony MDR-XB700. I like the comfort and full sound but the mids and highs seem to be lacking.

**Music**- Classical to EDM and everything in between. Like I said- I require a balanced sound.

Thank you!

* ODAC &gt; Bottlehead Crack with speedball &gt; Sennheiser HD 650

[Unboxing album with some extra blurbs](http://imgur.com/a/5B00I)

To begin the review...

**Boxing**

I don't really care about boxing, which is fine. It looks like the headphones are marketed toward teenagers, given the styling of the box. Their [website](http://www.rockitsounds.com) is similar. This contrasts most of my gear, which is targeted to more adult audiences. But I tried not to make judgment yet.

**Accessories**

The R-50s come with a nice clamshell case

The tips provided are minimal for what I would consider ""acceptable."" Three sizes of silicone tips are provided. They are all single-flanged. They fit *alright*, they isolate about as I'd expect a single flange tip to isolate. Not as good as an Etymotic tip or a custom, but there's quite enough passive isolation.

They came with an airline adapter. This is weird

**Build Quality**

I think the construction is pretty good. The braided cord seems a little flimsy and thin

The housings are made of plastic with a rubber coating. They seem pretty durable. Like I said

There is memory wire near the housing at the area that goes over your ear. I think it's pretty nice

**Sound Quality**
The part you've been waiting for. I'm going to break this down into lows

*Lows*

The lows on these are present, however, in that is it clean, precise, and fast. Personally, I prefer this type of bass, so it works great for my taste. These are by no means, a basshead IEM.

*Mids*

The mids are the star of the show. I really like mid-centric headphones that are clean, and beautiful. These IEMs provide very nice, analytical, crisp mids that are pretty forward. They are not full and juicy like my HD 650s with Bottlehead Crack, but cool and crisp, like a chilled glass of water compared to a mug of hot chocolate. They are impactful and precise, but not thin. They're definitely thinner than my HD 650s, particularly for this price point.

*Highs*

The treble on these are wonderful, so it works for me, but some people may think of them as a little harsh. They're sparkling, crystal clear, and lively. Everything is very detailed and crisp. The highs on these are actually better than the HD 650s, in my opinion - but only ever so slightly. That's probably because I think forward treble is a good thing, and the HD 650s definitely don't have forward treble

**Synopsis**

These are very good IEMs for the price. They are not bass-heavy by any means, and precise. The highs are very good - the provide a forward, clear experience with possible sibilance to the the sensitive. The build quality is good, accessories are minimal. Overall, very good value at $120.

1364386080.0,1b3t4f,"[REVIEW] Cosmic Ears CIEMs ""Sport""",cero,14,3,0,"**TL;DR Fantastic value for money**



I wanted CIEMs for a while now but wasn't really prepared to shell out a lot of money for them. So when I heard about [Cosmic Ears \(CE\)](http://www.cosmicears.com/) I jumped at the chance of getting a pair of affordable CIEMs.

I opted for the ""Sport"" model from the old line-up. This is a single balanced armature with an emphasis on bass. I happen to like bass so for around 100 euros without shipping this sounded like a good deal.

Well

* **Making impressions** You have the option to buy a DIY kit from CE to make your own impressions but since I had three sets of impressions made at an audiologist which all weren't good enough

I decided to go ahead and have the monitors made inspite of less than perfect impressions. This does mean that CE couldn't give me a warranty on fit

* **[How they look](http://imgur.com/a/gVAo2#6)** As you can see, they fit perfectly. These are full-shell and are, as a consequence, huge. Nevertheless, they are flush with my ears and do not give me a cramped feeling like you'd get with a IEM that goes deep into your earcanal. But make no mistake, these monitors go deep aswell.

My reference monitors are the RE0s and the Panasonic RP-HJE900. Two distinctly different IEMs that cost about the same. I like the RE0s for their analytical clarity

* **How do they sound?** *Listening to them right now on a Cowon J3, modern classical, folk, ambient and some pop at mostly 320kbps mp3s.* 

* **Bass** These monitors are bass-heavy but seem to roll-off before extending down to 20hz. Bass is snappy and detailed, tbh.

* **Mid-range** Slightly veiled but not recessed with adequate separation/sound stage. I find the mid-range to be detailed

* **High-end** Just a touch of sibilance at higher volumes and I can't say there's a sparkle or airiness to the high-end but it's sufficient

In conclusion: If you are looking for affordable CIEMs that sound great Cosmic Ears is a no-brainer. Could you get better sounding IEMs for around 100 euros? I don't doubt it to be honest

I use my headphones with my PC

I use my headphones whenever I am at my PC, sweaty ears isn't something I've found to be a problem). With so much use, I also need durability. My last two headsets each lasted about a year, which I don't want to become a trend.

I'm not particularly concerned with leakage or isolation. I live with other people and tend to like being aware of what's going on still, I tend to prefer a Circumaural design, but so long as it's comfortable I have nothing aginst supra-aural. In-ear is out of the question.

When it comes to the actual sound quality

Aside from that, and in-line volume control is a big plus, but not a dealbreaker. I'm not interested in also getting any kind of amp or what not.

I'm looking to spend around $80-140, so shipping and all that.

I submitted this over on r battlestations but people don't have too much interest. 

Here are my comments:
I don't know about ""favorites""


**LCD3** 
Fantastic all around. It's hard to find fault in the sound. The bass, you will get a feel for what ""extended"" bass sounds like. It is very clearly not a 1 note thud. Many claim that LCDs are uncomfortable, I actually find them to be quite comfortable. Really the only negatives is that you can't tilt your head forward too much (e.g. looking down when reading / writing), and under the cups it does get a little warm where the leather touches your skin. I have to lift the ear pads up from time to time and rub the skin quickly to clear it. Another note - burn in ACTUALLY exists for these. The membrane is tight when you get them. They sound incredibly muddy. Give it ~24 hrs and it gets so much clearer. (I never believed in burn in before. I am now willing to admit that at least for planars, it exists.)


**HD650** 
Fantastic. Best value of the bunch. Does almost nothing wrong. Even head-to-head with the LCD3 it does a fantastic job. Buy these and know you are getting 80% of top of the line sound! I love them. The only negative


**Grado SR325is** 
I was a little disappointed with the build quality / comfort of these. The clip that holds the cups to the headband is slightly broken on mine. I guess I can send them in for repair. I checked my buddy's pair and he has the same problem! I also can't wear them for long periods of time. The ear pads don't distribute the weight evenly and they kind of jut into your ear.   The sound is fun, at low listening levels these sound great!


**Audio Technica ATh-M50s** 
I like the sound quality on these. They are a step up from most headphones on the market. That being said

I got them for 110$ brand new.

Sound Quality: These things sound pretty nice

Highs are just a slight bit harsh but I only really notice on a few songs.

the soundstage is pretty narrow

Isolation is pretty good

Comfort: unfortunately these headphones do start to get a little bit uncomfortable after about an hour at which point I have to take them off.

Overall these are pretty good for public or home use





HD 598

I got these for around 215$ off Amazon

Sound Quality: these sound great

Comfort: these are really comfortable

Isolation: None

Needs:

- over ear, AND wear glasses.

Sound quality and bass are not extremely important to me as long as they aren't extremely weak. I usually prefer to listen to music through my speakers anyway. It's mostly about being able to wear them for a decent length of time.

1339963078.0,v6u9j,Was requested so here is my first review: Sennheiser HD598,Drewsipher,13,0,8,"Well


Little background on me. I am a ska kid who loves all music has to offer. From jazz to punk, as well as various crappy ear buds, and a pair of razer gaming headphones. So lets get started


* Comfort: As I said part of the reason for the upgrade was a comfort level that wasn't being achieved before. These things fit like a glove. The cups seem to fit my head just tight enough to make a good seal and sit perfect on my head without worrying at all. The velour pads are comfortable and I have been wearing them hours on end every night since I got them listening to various music and such without any sort of discomfort. Big plus side to these

* Jazz: I love me some good jazz

* Ska: I love ska

* Blues: Eric Clapton provided a beautiful way to test music of various tempos of one of my favorite genres. His vocals came through admirably. He has a way of sucking you in without you realizing and these headphones highlighted that vocal tone well. His guitar popped well. His solos where clean and precise. I went from Layla to Change the World and both where amazing to listen to. There is a certain magic to the blues in different tempos and I can't wait to get more from other blues greats in less lossy formats (my bb king was my dads ripped... around 200 kbps... sad sad day. I went in on his computer recently and switched his zune software to rip at least 320 mp3...)

* Electronic: I also like some techno from time to time so I took a listen to some techno I had on hand. Deadmau5 and Daft Punk where on the menu here. I am not a basshead

Pros: Great sound in a comfortable package. I already feel like I got my moneys worth with these headphones. Perfect sound for me. Some may not like the low end

Cons: While not a deal breaker for me these headphones have a bit of a weird construction. The plastic throughout is light and provides a great experience when kicking back and just LISTENING. If you are going to wear these out a lot I would be worried traveling with them. For me they are going to be on my desk a lot so I don't mind it


Overall I am SUPER happy with my purchase. I am becoming a bit of a Sennheiser fan,False,,t5_2rcyx,False,,,t3_v6u9j

Back in the summer of 09', but now that they're supremely portable **40gb**, (8+32gb) **20 hour** cans... I use them even more! =)  Those scratches accumulated over four years of toting.

In my current revision, but I eventually took it out because I found it almost transparent.  The clip on the Clip+ was ripped off and the back sanded flat to reduce size and keep the cans foldable, while double-sided velcro was used to attach the Clip+.  I used a technique i learned from ""Captain Odegard"" to make the ultramini plugs; each component of the plug was separated and soldered individually, then epoxied together and finished with heatshrink.

In my first attempt, powered by a strip of button cells.  The amp was a great theory, but poorly executed; it wasn't worth the battery life and making the cell strip was not fun, and less fun to replace.  I also used a far-too-long 12-inch interconnect with standard size jacks.  I considered installing a bluetooth receiver where the amp was and almost did, but I decided against it since bluetooth sucks.  Also, I Rockboxed the Clip+, so yes... I'm playing helicopter on my headphones in one of those pics.  Also plays FLAC, yadda yadda... sorted by tags and folders.

* Buying a second

    * Relatively neutral (but not Etymotic flat - although I love my hf5's
    * Previously used: CX300, SR-80i, PS-500
    * Music: Mainly Classic 70's Rock, Pop, basically everything/anything.
* Investing in a vinyl source (i.e. turntable and pre-amp) - how many people here listen to vinyl through headphones?  Are headphones just too revealing for vinyl?  Am I just going to hear pops and crackles all the time?
* Power-amp(s) and bookshelf speakers
* Quit buying shiny pieces of electronics

I've not really included any streaming/HD based sources here - partly because nothing I've seen on the market really tickles my fancy here.  One of the reasons I like my current CD player based setup is that it's offline - which means I can sit back and listen with no IT related distractions (e.g. reddit).

Basically, but sounds phenomenal. The headphones I have plugged into it (extensively) are, in order of how long I've used them with it, coincidentally they are also in order of headphone nirvana and goodness...:

* Shure SE215s

* Sennheiser IE80s

* Heir Audio 3.Ais

Sections will be in order of relative importance. 

----

##Sound Quality:

The Z2 is the best sounding device I own.  I don't have anything else really that decent, but no measurements are available that I could find.  The Z2, very importantly, has *output impedance below 1 ohm.*  There is not a headphone in the world that will have insufficient electrical dampening with it.  It will not(\*) alter any headphone's sonic character when it feeds them.  I don't think it would really be strong enough for 80 ohm or higher impedance headphones, not if you wanted to listen fairly loud anyway.  

Next up: response.  The Z2 is not an O2.  It is not perfectly level from 20/20k, but the zHD does have noticeably *bigger* bass.  

Now, you will find none at all.  

The Z2 is incredibly detailed and finessed, or reveal something similar to vinyl pops but in the bass in iTunes files.  It does *not* happen if I make my own 256k VBR AACs, does not happen with 400k AACs, and does not happen with 512k AACs.  It is *not* an issue inherit in its AAC decoding.  The Z2 will not leave you wanting to pair it with an external amp to reap sonic rewards.  The Z2's stereo separation is also great, again, best in class...

----

##Operation:

The Z2 is clunky.  The D3 seems like it was a beta 0.5, but not infuriating &lt;1/4s delay on subsequent swipes.  This ""resets"" in 7 seconds of not touching the screen.  Speaking of seven seconds, that's an important number.  The media buttons, play/pause/prev/next *stop working* after seven seconds of screen inactivity.  The volume controls continue to function, however.  That's pep peeve #1, if I stop playback to talk to someone or whatever, I need to turn the screen on to restart it.  The player also is extremely specific about files.  It supports every format under the sun, and at the letter F it stops reading artist stuff correctly

The internet browser and wifi work fine for casual use, only view specific types (and curiously, it can't open PDFs).  Android apps can be sideloaded, but the play store is not supported.  

The UI is good enough, especially with on the fly playlist expansion.  

---- 

##Battery life:

Battery life is ok

However, it still eats the battery, dropping 14% overnight if you forget to turn it off.  If you turn it off, the meter will still say you lost 2-3% overnight.  It really can't hold a charge that well...

----

##Build Quality:

Build is *nice, and the rubberization of the whole backside makes it feel good in the hands.  I've dropped it 4ft into a thin layer of snow with ground beneath it and got some ""chewed pencil"" (but shallower) dings on the corner, nothing else.  

I've gotten it wet, but it will not short out in rain.  

----

## Playback

Playback is smooth, and filetype.  It isn't huge, but it's there.  When you resume or begin playback, it makes a little micro-skip, the first 20ms or something stops and starts again.  Not a huge deal, but every pause has that on it.  Rarely, but sometimes it will refuse to play a file; producing 5 seconds of silence followed by skipping to the next track.

The *physical* next and last buttons can have anywhere from zero to five seconds of delay on them, bitrate, and CvsVBR, that is *annoying as hell* very often.  The UI buttons have a consistent delay of somewhere between 1/4 and 1/2 second.
JetEffects is a built in package of stuff run through the music app, and some bass and stereo modifications.  The EQ is really, really nice, and behaves very much like a hardware EQ.  You get 3 programmable frequencies per band, wide/normal/narrow band, 5 bands, and +/- 12 units (not dB) per band to adjust with.  The EQ is really nice,"" guess what it does

----

##The bottom line

The Z2 is a hell of a playback device.  Most of it is flaky, hard, the battery life isn't great, and the lack of working sleep sucks, hard, but it has no competition.  There's the iPod, offering 423423414134 other functions in the same package, which don't sound as good, and if that's what you want

It's... worth it if you can afford it, have worse battery life, and have godawful UIs while costing over 2x as much .  There is no way to get straight DAC output (unless you could get audio over USB working in the newest android, but I am not sure the firmware can be updated to that, Cowon doesn't have a DL for it), but the SQ and low impedance make that a nonissue, unless you need to drive some hungry cans, but then you're transportable

1349477714.0,110mhj,A rather extensive review of the Beyerdynamic Custom One Pros!,the_trev,11,1,5,"These arrived in the mail on tuesday, it would be impossible to relate to them. So this is all just my opinion

I tested these with a Cowon S9 and M-audio 2496 soundcard. This review is mostly done with the Cowon

First of all, and after 6 years it's still not a problem. The leather ear pads that come with it feel a little hard which I'm sure will loosen up over time, however I've purchased some DT770/990 velour pads for it (more on this later) which are far more comfortable. The casing is made from a good quality plastic which doesn't look like it will break anytime soon. And of course, if it does, you can just replace the part! I know that the product has just launched and the accessories / spare parts catalogue is minimal at the moment: I'm assuming when the other two cans in the product line come out then the selection will become larger. 

An issue I encountered when I wanted to start listening to music on the go is that the cable that comes with it is 1.5m. This is too long to be moving about with, further enhanced by a small slit in the cable that lines up with a dent in the body, and makes a satisfying click when it's pushed in. This particular cable isn't going to come out any time soon. I've ordered a 1.2m cable for the time being from amazon until I can find somewhere that will sell a proper Beyer cable, and I don't think I will have an issue with a generic cable. I know that they sell new ones on their website, but from the UK it's £5 for the cable plus £20 delivery. £25 in total, come on Beyer: you're not Monster are you?

So, fully closed and partially closed are too weak. I guess it really is all down to personal preference, but once you've been mucking about with it for a few hours, you'll find a setting you're happy with and probably never change it again. I haven't changed mine since Tuesday night.

Something to mention which I shouldn't be shocked about, but if you're in a quiet room then it's better to close off the bass a bit if you don't want to disturb anyone. This really only affects people who listen to the music loud, however if you do this then enjoy going deaf in your older age ;)

Even with the slider all the way open

And now, the infamous 'Beyer Mids'? Not here. I just can't hear any dip in sound in the mid-spectrum. When listening without EQ or effects, I can hear those frequencies perfectly fine, the bass and treble does not overpower the mids in any way. My DT990's seem to have this, so that is one thing I can be sure of :)

OK

**Rage Against The Machine - Eponymous** - One of my favourite albums of all time, just 4 guys, 4 instruments and a clean recording. First thing I noticed was the bass kick. I shit you not, I have *never* heard it that clean. The cans provide a fairly hefty punch every time, and combined with a bass guitar, the lower frequencies never feel like they are struggling for power. Morello's guitar work is on show here, hearing subtleties in his work. The vocals do seem to take a backstage to everything else

**Daft Punk - Discovery** - The soundstage is huge (as Daft punk planned, I think they planned that too). What results is a very strong sounding experience.

**Pink Floyd - Wish You Were Here** - That guitar solo at the beginning of Shine On stands out. I started to notice a pattern throughout my testing

**Hardcore to the bone - Vol. XVI** - I like gabber. There I said it. I wanted to include this because it's a full frontal assault on the headphones, so the clarity that these headphones usually have just seem to lose some the genre's charm. Considering that not a lot of people listen to this genre, I don't think anyone needs to worry about this.

**Hans Zimmer - Inception OST** - hmmmm. The more ambient pieces were clear and beautiful, so I tried a different orchestral album to see if it was the recording or the headphones....

**Cinematic Orchestra - Les Ailes Pourpres** - I tried all of the Cinematic Orchestra's albums because I'm a big fan of them, soaring string sections and xylophone pieces that just radiate with goodness. CO's other albums were equally as good, really bringing to life the saxo's and the trumpets of Man With a Movie Camera. 

I could add more, but I'm sure somewhere someone has asked that question. I think there might be a bit more leakage of sound, and there definitely is a different in noise isolation (I can hear a lot more around me with the velours). The leather pads are better at keeping sound out, but of course will get uncomfortable after a long period of wear.

A side note

So yeah, but the cable is replaceable and size doesn't really matter anyway. I would recommend trying them before you buy though, as I'm sure someone with some more experience with other over-the-ear headphones will be able to make comparisons to other sets!",,False,,t5_2rcyx,,http://www.reddit.com/r/headphones/comments/110mhj/a_rather_extensive_review_of_the_beyerdynamic/

After a few tries the sound started working on O2, my other headphones worked well, so it seems that the O2 input doesn't fit jack of the DT 880 perfectly? I hope it works from now on.

Then I did a left channel vs right channel test, I figured that I can use them just as well by just wearing them reversed. Returning them would take weeks so I don't think I'll do that. Sucks though if I ever happen to resell them.

(I also have a pair of Logitech Z-2300 speakers for my computer that I love but I can't always use those.)

Anyways I'm budgeting myself to around $150 for the full headphone replacements and $50 for the IEMs.

The full-sized will be used for gaming, as well as Skype and the like. The IEMs will be used exclusively for music (iPod with at least V0) and iPad when I can't carry around the full-sized.

My musical tastes range from lighter stuff like The National/Depeche Mode/Mumford and Sons to hardcore/metal/hard rock with everything in between. So in general rock music I suppose.

Open headphones are fine, comfort and cord-length are the only other important things I can think of since I'm pretty tall and have a weird head with windy ear canals. I know for both attachments/mods can be used though.

So from my research this is what I have found recommended at times-

Full-sized:

Audio Technica ATH-AD700 Open-air Dynamic Audiophile Headphones

Sony MDR7506 Professional Large Diaphragm Headphone

Beyerdynamic DT 770 PRO

Sennheiser HD 558 Headphones

Creative Aurvana Live! Headphones
	
Audio-Technica ATH-M50 Professional Studio Monitor Headphones

Others mentioned include Grados (don't remember the models)


IEM:

Monoprice 8320

Brainwavz Beta

Brainwavz ProAlpha

Brainwavz M1

So what does /r/headphones recommend?
