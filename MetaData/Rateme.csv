Third number is 1-9 on the persons body.

So if its only a face pic

edit: spelling

Edit 2: so the second number might be pointless but I mean I've seen some comments on here with ppl saying ""pretty but you look like a bitch/stuck up/mean"" or whatever so that could define a 0 or 1. Like a ""your hot but you look like you get around. 8-0-9""

A little bit about me
As the title says, and trying to adapt to a more healthy lifestyle. My passion in life is working with horses. I ride mostly western, but will be getting back into English riding lessons to be a jumper. Other than horses, I enjoy photography, reading, writing, drawing, and pretty much anything that involves being in the great outdoors. I rarely wear makeup

I would love any advice you guys have for me. I am aware that I need to lose a few pounds
