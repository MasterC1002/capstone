**IMPORTANT! if you are a graduate/PhD student

So as of now, and 2 unconfirmed genetics teachers. 

The 4 confirmed teachers will all be teaching Neuroscience and their own subset

Hopefully the 2 genetics teachers will confirm

 I am still looking for more Genetics teachers &amp; biochem ones

1) How will we structure the syllabus? 

Right so, we will start at highschool level) they could enjoy and understand research talks from then on with some concept lectures, but please throw your opinion at me because I need to know what you guys think! 

2) I would definitely be interested

The lectures will all be pre-recorded

3) Hi I am a researcher/graduate in (any bioscience) and I-

Hold right there! Are you interested in teaching?! Or giving a 10 minute talk about your current research? I am aiming to make a mix of concept material plus current research to students, this would be sort of like IAMA, apart from you will talk about your research and the students will ask scientific questions regarding your research!

**Hello all

This is my first time posting on Reddit (been lurking for 1 year), so do correct me if possible. 

**This is both a interest check

1. Personally to improve my English, and this would be great on a CV too!

2. I am here because I would love to share some knowledge regarding what a lab life entails (as I believe it is not told to us properly at any stage of university/high school

3. To part my understanding of what I have read on articles

-----------

**What am I offering:**

I and several of my colleagues will be each individually teaching separate parts of this course; as the check count and colleague count rise
(Note: Remember most of the courses are BASIC entry

**The basics:**

**Genetics**: this includes what is DNA, transcription to translation, promoters &amp; more.

**Neuroscience**: Basics of what a neurone is

**Chronobiology**: Basics of the genetics behind chronobiology in Zebrafish organism model

**Possibilities/advance:**

There might be a possibility of adding more modules into this course as it gets larger, this is all just debate at the moment, nothing is finalized. And if anyone knows how to edit the thread name, please comment below :)!

**Subset of neuroscience**: The field of neuroscience is huge, and discuss what are the current affairs in that area. (**including neuro-imaging, neuro-cellbiology, computational neuroscience**)

**Biochemistry**: The works of a cell and more!

**Lablife**: little info on Lab life how research works based on my experience and others. Images on equipment and how they facilitate research will be added

-------------

**How will the course be operated?**

I would give probably **10 minute video** lectures at a time for the basics

The Genetics module would be more of a ""pre-requisit"" for the Chronobiology.

I hope to get some of my colleagues interested if they have the time

I have linked this page to a few of my colleagues, more info will be posted as I continue to get more information. 

Thing to note about 10min videos

As far as which courses will be taught first, current affairs and other courses. 

**Tutor groups will also be held in a subreddit** for students to discuss among themselves with possible lecturer to jump in and steer them in the right direction for each video session.

**Research talks** I aim to bring in people from different labs to talk about their work once most basic concepts have been taught

-------------

**What makes us difference from generic Youtube videos online?**

So some people have personally asked me what difference is this compared to some of the Youtube clips already online? Well

1. Typically the Youtube videos are quite scattered

2. It will be tailored to make it an access course for complete beginners to (and this is the crucial part) understand current research and affairs

3. Final is to add relevant reading material (current

Final note: In no way am I senior researcher etc, both for your gain and mine, this is also a learning curve for me, and a great opportunity!

**If you're interested in this class

**UPDATE: The Juicy Deets**  
Alright everyone, November 18th. I will send a PM to anyone who replies to this post with all the details on how to join the class, and details on where to go to watch the recorded videos. I will also make another post (an UPDATE post) a few days before the class begins with all the exact details. A note, you do *not* have to install Arch Linux or CentOS on your system. If you're comfortable with Ubuntu, or Linux Mint, then keep that. We will only be installing CentOS in our KVMs--the host does not matter. I will work with people in any distro to get the lab properly set up. Please, if there is anything that you're interested in learning

**Original Post**  
Hello all. Back in the day when I got into Linux there was an incredible guy on the EFnet channel #linuxhelp whom I owe much of where I am today and what I know to. He was always willing to help a newb. So, because that is the best distro to know if you ever plan on being a system administrator.

**What are the requirements for the class?**

No knowledge of Linux is required. Because we will be working with KVM, we will see that there is a ""Yes"" listed next to ""AMD's Virtualization Technology,"" which means that the CPU supports hardware virtualization. If we check the product details for Intel's i7-2600, we see that there is a ""Yes"" listed for Intel's Virtualization Technology (VT-x), which means that the CPU supports hardware virtualization. If you're already in Linux, you can check by typing  grep svm /proc/cpuinfo for AMD CPUs, or grep vmx /proc/cpuinfo for Intel CPUs. If the grep statement returns nothing, you're good to go. If your CPU does not support hardware virtualization, so you'll be on your own following along.

I will be streaming my desktop, though this is not necessary. We will be communication via our mics, but I will also try to get a chat environment setup as well.

**When?**

We will meet every Sunday evening at 7PM PST. If you'd like to meet at a different time

**Syllabus**

*Week 1: Getting Installed
First, and will be running CentOS VMs. The install will be CentOS. We will then setup 3 CentOS VMs. After our environment is setup, we will be covering the basics of the shell environment. What is a shell? What can we do with the shell? Getting around the filesystem, and so on.

*Week 2: The shell in-depth*  
We will spend some time comparing different shell environments (e.g., and more in-depth subjects, such as piping, redirection, some basic shell scripting (loops, conditional statements), environment variables, etc), brace expansion

*Week 3: System management*

We will begin by writing some simple shell scripts.

*Week 7: Advanced shell scripts*  
More scripting. Arrays, and more.

We will be creating a MySQL backend for our system administration scripts from earlier

**About Me**  
I have been a Linux user for 15 years now, AIX, and HP-UX. I love automation, and truly believe that the best system administrator is the one who does the least amount of work.

Everyone starts somewhere and personally when I first started I was placed in silver. With tips from forums and my own individual practice

Fundamental Strategy (Gold-Platinum):

Anyone who is in Diamond league can tell the leap to Masters league is a tough one. You may have the mechanics

Your mechanics are good, there is always something new to learn. In advanced strategies, we will break down professional play, learn to set up your strategies, and focus on specific ways on how you can improve your play (eg: Focus on better creep spread, harassing as protoss, etc.)

On May 6, a simple platform that allowed teachers to create courses and increase communication with students. Since the founding post we have had students and teachers come to UReddit from 195 countries, with 3.5 million unique views, and 70,000 registered members.

Initially it was a one man show, entrepreneurs, communication professionals, and the best subreddit moderators around. With a completely volunteer based team spread throughout the US, it was an interesting challenge to work together and continue to help each of you teach and learn from one another; however, thanks to technology we established an amazing organization.

As of August 27, we knew that UReddit as a platform would not be suitable for the amount of growth we have seen. With this Open Compass was born.

There are plenty of online education and massively open online class (MOOC) platforms, at your own pace, or even a hybrid of in class and online. A system developed specifically based on all of the feedback we have received over the past two years. A community based education platform built by you, for you, and all of the proceeds go back into the continued advancement of Open Compass.

So

**We have the new platform built, and of course provide you some awesome swag as well. For those curious, we do also have other funding models developed as well, so after we have kickstarted Open Compass we’ll be working with schools, universities, organizations, and anyone else that needs their own custom designed private training and education platform separate from our new platform (but you won’t have to worry about this).

So my fellow redditors, and more importantly bacon (I prefer beer)? With your help we can ensure Open Compass remains a non-profit with a mission of leading you to open education.

For more details [please view our Kickstarter page and trailer here](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1918344721/open-compass).

**Open Compass Features (to be improved upon):**

* Video streaming of live lectures

* Recorded lectures are automatically processed for speech-to-text to generate transcripts

* Teachers can also display slides or share their desktop

* Students have audio chat and can enable webcams if they like

* Fully-featured course management software similar to the type used by many major universities (including gradebooks, a chatroom, and much more)

* Live lectures are automatically recorded if desired

* User and admin levels (Instructor, student, observer, etc.)

* reddit instance for general and public discussion

The first part would consist of lessons:

* 1.) Introduction
- Why did Google develop Android? Google's Philosophies
- Setting up Eclipse (downloading SDK
- Hello World
* 2.) The Manifest File : Let's Go Meta
* 3.) Activities: The Life Force
* 4.) Intents: Guide Us Oh Great One
* 5.) Layouts I: Introduction to Widgets
* 6.) Layouts II: Advanced Widgets
* 7.) Layouts III: Handling Various Screen Densities
* 8.) Phone Sensors: Interacting With Our Masters
* 9.) Tablets: Go Big or Go Home

Each lesson with have a development project to reinforce concepts taught.

The second part would be a huge group Android project that would bring many minds together to create something positive for the world. :)

Background on myself:

- Fourth year CS student.
- Android developer for roughly 2 years
- I have worked for my University doing Android development for over a year
- I have written a few apps in my free time that are on Google Play
- I have been doing iOS development as well for about 6 months

Prerequisites: 

- Fair knowledge of Object - Oriented Programming
- Some experience with Java

Edit: Going to talk with a friend tomorrow about co-teaching this.  Regardless

Each lesson will probably be a video with supplementary links and an attached assignment.  If you run into any problems doing an assignment,False,self,t5_2rqj9,1345508181.0,,,t3_yjgxr

I'm not sure if this will be a very popular offer
This class will cover movements going from early cinema to the French New Wave. This is not a class about contemporary cinema (which I could eventually build if there is interest).

We will explore the notions of ""a canon"", and much more. This class is a **history** class. We will explore film theories, movements and techniques, but we will **not learn** how to make films. We will learn about movements such as : German expressionism, early Russian Cinema, Poetic realism, Neorealism, which means : people with interest for him who have never taken a film history class.  People with film knowledge are more than welcome to participate. This class will allow you to learn about film culture without having to take part in an expensive college class. However

There will be no assignments. Each class will be either text based or video based (see form). There will be **discussions** and a list of films to watch for every class. A list of optional readings will also be provided when available. I will try as much as I can to provide free and legal ways to see the movies that are ""hard"" to find. If that's not possible

**About me**  
I am a film Major and I'd like to be a film teacher eventually. I'm also a video artist (I've shown my work in many art galleries) and I've written for various local paper and online magazines about film (in French). I am not a film studies PhD but my understanding of film and film history will make it an interesting and fun class.

**Why would you want to take this class?**  
- To learn about film history
- To understand where the films we watch now come from  
- To understand the importance of cinema in modern culture  
- To be able to *see* films in a new way  
- To develop a passion for movies of any kind  
- To share and discuss your vision of film  
- To learn how to name-drop! Oh sweet
- If you ever wanted to take a film history or art history class

Readings will include craft essays

**Prerequisites**: Readings will be distributed via Google Drive or through web links

**Qualifications**: B.A. and M.A. in English, and critical theory.  I'm currently a candidate for an M.F.A. entering my final year at the program.  I have ~5 years experience teaching Rhetoric and Composition and ~2 years teaching Creative Writing.  I'm also currently an assistant fiction editor at a nationally distributed literary journal.

* Module 2: Characterization and Character Development
* Module 3: Telling Time
* Module 4: Point of View/Focalization (Intro. and Advanced)
* Module 5: Genre: Blending and Bending
* Module 6: Language and Discourse (Intro. and Advanced)
* Module 7: On Writing and Revision
* Module 8: On Business and Publication

If you are interested drop a comment

UPDATE: I have to get my projects done first
I thought of a tutorial -style approach for the main lessions and a live vent Q&amp;A on some questions after one lession.

FAQ:

1: *Materials needed?*
The expensive part will be the programmer. The average price of these things varies from 5 to 30 bucks. The cheapest one I could find is the ""USBasp"" for most of the ATMEL micros.
My personal suggestion would be to buy a PICKIT2 or the USBasp I mentioned before.
..and while you are at it, soldering stuff, a veroboard, some other stuff involving your project (LEDs, relays, something like that) and of course one or more standard microcontrollers (ATmega8, PIC18F4550

2: *What should I already know?*
The basic knowledge for this course is knowing at least a bit about electronics
*You know what voltage/current is and Ohm's law
*You know Kirchhoff's two famous laws about currents and voltages (voltage divider for example)
*You are willing to read datasheets

Additionally

*Usage of capacitors/diodes and transistors
*ANSI-C

3: From scratch developing?
Yes. That means that you'll be experimenting on a breadboard with your parts and maybe turning your circuit into a PCB.

4: What topics are discussed?
I'll split the whole course into different parts:

*Basic circuitry and choosing you microcontroller
*Setting up your IDE and programming the first program (featuring a LED)
*Basic C and ASM routines (timed loop
*More information about outer circuitry including interrupt pins, USART

A little while later we welcomed anastas to the team who had more experience with web development, so he mostly took over in that department.

At this point it didn't make any sense for me to keep universityofreddit.com in my own portfolio, if anyone needed to make modifications to the domain, they could do so. Additionally, if I ever left uofreddit, I wouldn't be taking the domain with me. It just seemed like the most logical solution.

I think we shall start next week. I will need some time to go thru some lesson plans. I think I will structure it into a 6-week course

* Intro to Game theory (do you want the boring history?)
  * Rational Choice theory
  * What the frak is a game?
* Nash equilibriums 
  * Backward induction (I hope this will be covered in the intro
  * Domination (or submission for those of you who are BDSM-inclined)
  * Best response functions
* Examples of Nash equilibriums in 2-player games
  * Prisoner's Dilemma
  * One card stud poker
  * Cournot and Bertrand's oligopolies
  * Why didn't US and Russia launch nukes at each other during the Cold War
* Representing games
  * Normal form
  * Extensive form
* More examples of Nash equilibriums in n-player games
  * Introduction to SPNEs
  * Perfect information auctions
  * Ultimatum game/Dick (tator) game/Holdup game
  * Stackleburg's duopoly
  * Winning an Election - I might talk about why Ron Paul never stood a chance
* Repeated game theory
  * Brief introduction to other forms of equilibriums
  * Repeated PD
  * Case study of the cereal industry
  * Are we good by nature?

I think I'll end here. You'll notice I didn't include games of imperfect information. I debated with myself whether to put in stuff like Bayesian games (I have a mancrush on Rev. Bayes (and von Neumann))

Of course, I won't be doing imperfect information games, bayesian games, evolutionary stable strategies (I'm writing a paper on that), and stuff that mainly deals with a lot of microeconomics, like the Core. I do, however, so, so I won't go into it.

I think with the lesson plan I have, no offence meant). Also, with a lot of the newer stuff with regards to matching games (you know, Al Roth and friends), I won't be teaching, and will be left up to the reader as an exercise

Thank you all for expressing interest in the course, Signup has begun, and lectures will be posted at end of September! 

**(Signup at Ureddit.com)**

We are making amazing progress in terms of the number of students that have joined the course

**Currently our group consist of:**

1. **20 teachers (8 are a part of teams conducting cutting edge research)**

2. **12-13 modules (Which the syllabus and lecturer responsible published soon!)**

3. **A student studying psychology who is going to be helping us ensure a good student teacher relation

We are currently in the process of writing curriculums for the modules and recruiting more students. If you have any friends

If there are any questions pertaining to anything please feel free to comment on this post (and once we have a name; we will have an email ID that you could write to).

**Below are more of what we are offering

-------------

**Hello all

I am doing this due to several reasons:

1. Personally to improve my English, and this would be great on a CV too!

2. I am here because I would love to share some knowledge regarding what a lab life entails (as I believe it is not told to us properly at any stage of university/high school

3. To part my understanding of what I have read on articles

-----------

**What are we offering:**

I and several of my colleagues will be each individually teaching separate parts of this course. We have split the courses offered into 2 distinctive groups

**The Basics:**

1. **Genetics/Biology**
2. **Neuroscience**
3. **Biochemistry**
4. **Chemistry**
5. **Mol/Cell Biology**

**The Advanced:**

1. **Subset of neuroscience**: (**including neuro-imaging
2. **Biochemistry**
3. **Mol/Cell Biology**

-------------
**How will the course be operated?**

I would give probably **10 minute video** lectures at a time for the basics

Thing to note about 10min videos
As far as which courses will be taught first

**Tutor groups will also be held in a subreddit** for students to discuss among themselves with possible lecturer to jump in and steer them in the right direction for each video session.

**Research talks** I aim to bring in people from different labs to talk about their work once most basic concepts have been taught

-------------

**What makes us difference from generic Youtube videos online?**

So some people have personally asked me what difference is this compared to some of the Youtube clips already online? Well

1. Typically the Youtube videos are quite scattered

2. It will be tailored to make it an access course for complete beginners to (and this is the crucial part) understand current research and affairs

3. Final is to add relevant reading material (current

-------------

Final note: In no way am I senior researcher etc, both for your gain and mine, this is also a learning curve for me, and a great opportunity!

About myself- I've been playing FPS games since they came out

For modern FPS and competition- 

**Competed in**

* Counter Strike Source
* Call of Duty
* Call of Duty United Offensive
* Call of Duty 2
* Call of Duty 4
* Call of Duty Black Ops
* Call of Duty Modern Warfare 3
* Halo 1 on Xbox (very shortly in a few tournaments)
* Was trained by zEx member
* Was on team GDEC with Gladiator for Call of Duty 1 and some of 2
* Trained with Swedish CS Team ""Hammer""

Most recently took 2nd place on the PSGN CoD Black Ops Hardcore SnD ladder

The most recent event was taking 2nd place in TWL's MW3 SnD launch tournament.




As for the class itself I had planned to make a series of tutorial videos already, what players to look for, how to set up a strategy, how to evaluate a map, and creating and executing strategies. I will also cover a lot of the thought pattern behind a player and how to think a situation through to play smarter than your opponent.

This will be primarily Call of Duty Modern Warfare 3, and the foundation is a lot of real life infantry tactics so it could be used in Airsoft or paintball. I'd get actual military training though instead of this for real life, obviously.

Method would be a weekly Youtube video posted on the topic. Questions could be posted on some method

* Filesystem concepts: the filesystem hierarchy, mounting.

* How a system brings itself up: bootloaders
* Package management.
* Configuring X11 (i.e. hacking your xorg.conf).
* Others?
* Server administration topics.  This is sort of nebulous at this point, PAM, sshd.  If there is demand for a lesson on configuring another popular service (samba or httpd) that could be included as well.

**This course will require you to take your learning into your own hands.**  The most important thing to learn if you want to use or administrate a Unix system effectively is that you know to find solutions to problems.  If you take away one thing from this course

Zenhack and I have decided not to mandate the use of a particular distribution for the purposes of this course.  I feel that I can confidently answer questions pertaining to Arch Linux, and Debian-based distributions (Debian, Ubuntu, Linux Mint).

I will leave it to zenhack to describe what he is comfortable helping people with but my list should give you a fairly wide selection.  :-)

Prerequisites: we assume that you are not afraid to tinker with your computer.  You should feel comfortable performing on operating system installation (you will need Linux for this course anyway, install Linux in a virtual machine (see [VirtualBox](http://www.virtualbox.org)) if you don't want to take any risks.

Delivery of the class will be primarily textual.  I would be open to voice chat or other methods if they seem helpful.

**The first lesson should be posted Friday

**kdorf's qualifications**

* Computer science undergraduate (senior)
* Linux systems administrator professionally (three years)

**zenhack's qualifications**

* Bachelor's in CS
* 2+ years employment experience as a system administrator (using RHEL + ubuntu)
* Been using the system as my primary OS for five years
* Some experience maintaining a distro
* Experience with other unix-like OSes

I think that about covers it.  You can leave questions here or submit them via e-mail.

Hello! Following up on this request:

http://www.reddit.com/r/UniversityofReddit/comments/w604o/request_introduction_to_screenwriting/

I would like to formally offer an Introduction to Screenwriting class and was wondering how many people might be interested. The class, each uploaded to youtube, and will follow a structure something along the lines of this:

Part 1: Types of Scripts

Part 2: Feature Screenplay Formatting

Part 3: Software – CeltX

Part 4: Software – Final Draft

Bonus: Software – Scrivener

Part 5: Screenplay Structure

Part 6: Important Tips

Bonus: Basic A/V Script Formatting

Part 7: Additional Resources (or maybe something else with which to end)

(The lesson list isn't set in stone right now

I was also thinking it might be a good idea to give an optional assignment to those enrolled of writing a short script up to 5 pages in length (not including the title page.) You could then email me your script and I'd provide feedback on it or—if preferred—we could do some sort of group feedback if there's a practical enough way to do so.

Please feel free to post a response if you're interested

_________

Edit: I'm glad to see this is a popular topic! It looks like this would be a good class to start with, like to know how many of you might be interested in the class covering A/V scripts (these are used for commercials and other industrial videos—never for narrative features) and how many might be interested in covering Scrivener. Scrivener, it should be noted, is not built solely for screenplays. Final Draft is the industry standard and if you're going to pay for your screenwriting software, that's what I'd suggest you use. But I mention Scrivener because I figure some of those interested in this class are writers of novels, flash fiction, or other literature and may already have Scrivener and be more comfortable with it.

CeltX is listed because it's free. If you don't have Scrivener already, Final Draft AV (not the most creative name, I know.)

A couple of commenters note that they've written scripts before. If you've written scripts, then I will definitely be offering more classes. As mentioned here:

Some of the other classes I could do include ""Videography, and other things related to film and video production, pre-production, and post production."" And I'm sure a more advanced Screenwriting course would be helpful to some as well—probably a Writing the Feature Film course or something of the like.

A couple people here were interested in what I do or what my background is. I'm not trying to turn this post into an ad for myself, Northern Virginia, and Southern Maryland and shot weddings on weekends. I ICed (worked as an independent contractor) for a number of corporate marketing companies, doing videography primarily in the DC and New York areas and did Director of Photography work whenever I could find it, shooting a couple independent documentaries, a TV pilot, and recording live performances for a few small DC area theaters. I recorded referendums and events held by the Government of South Sudan in DC, by the way, New Mexico allows use of its state owned land for free for productions, do consider shooting in New Mexico. I did not write the screenplay we're shooting—I am only the Director of Photography and a Producer on the film. However

There are no deadlines anyway, don't worry. Refer to the  [FAQ](http://nuclearreactorphysics.weebly.com/planning.html) for more information.

The other reason why I will post lectures only every other week is that it takes a lot of time and I have a lot of things to do. It may happen that I fall behind

I set up a subreddit, ask for help, etc. Havingan active student community makes everything more fun and help boost your motivation.

If you emailed/messaged me and that I did not answer at all within two days


I really hope you will enjoy this class.

*EDIT:* Wow

Would there be any interest in a course on this? I've been working as a professional journalist, and I'm not so vain as to presume I have some great insights into the skills of my profession. But I do feel like I've picked up some techniques, tricks and ideas during my career that Redditors may find interesting and useful. 

Areas I would focus on: 

• Some basic background as well as the current state of the industry.

• Why you should be a journalist

• Choosing a subject to report on

• Finding sources and getting them to talk to you (I have a few idea for some exercises involving this).

• Interviewing tips; what to ask and how to ask it.

• Putting it all together and getting it out there to the world.

Now

This is fine with me

McPants32's course has a much large scope than mine does. I believe he intends to cover both server and client side web development technologies. As a result of this, though I have also admitted it might change (and it has, a little bit) as the course progresses. My course will be over when those topics are covered. I am *not condemning McPants32's approach* -- there's nothing wrong with it.

McPants32's HTML and CSS tutorials so far are not as thorough as mine are, his will cover much more of that. HTML and CSS together provide the presentational part of a web page, so my course -- which is spending much more time on HTML/CSS -- is much more about designing a page than it is about programming its behavior. If you wish to be able to design a page using HTML/CSS, my course may be preferable. If you already know CSS, or don't care to know it enough to be a designer and just want to know it well enough to interact with it via Javascript, you may want to look at McPants32's course instead. If you really are interested in knowing both thoroughly, you may want to take both courses concurrently.

Another difference between our courses is the presentation. Mine is and will continue to be text-based, you can take this into consideration as well.

The last major difference I've noticed is that I have formalized an assignment system and McPants32 has not. That is, and provide a thread to submit it. I 'grade' it by commenting on each submission and offering advice or corrections. I would not be surprised if McPants32 offered to do this as well if you posted your work in his subreddit, but I am actively encouraging (though not requiring) the submission of work. I believe that what UReddit has to offer that other standard web tutorials do not is feedback and interaction with the 'professor', and so I have focused heavily on providing that. That said, this is just how I have chosen to organize my course, and it may or may not be important to any given student.

I feel like I need to stress again that I am *not promoting my course and condemning McPants32's*. I designed my course in the way I would like to have taken it. So of course, because if I *did* like his more, I would have done it his way. But that is my bias, and I recognize that my opinion is just my opinion. You personally may prefer the way McPants32 handles his course, and if you do, that's where you should go.

I will PM McPants32 myself and invite him to comment on this post as well. He can say if I have misrepresented anything about his course and give his own take on any differences. Anyone who has looked through both courses trying to decide which one they wanted is welcome to chime in as well, please* keep it objective and nice. Nobody is here to battle, we're just here to find the best fit for everyone.

Thank you for your patience with my wordiness :)

The team at UReddit is secretly cranking away at some new ways to better this community and our services

We at UReddit know that education doesn’t stop in the classroom, we’re announcing two new offerings to UReddit:

**The monthly book club and discussion courses.**

**UReddit Book Club** The monthly book club will be an experiment/ trial for a weekly open discussion based on a book you all vote for. Each month we will select three books (they will be required to have a digital version available), one for each week of the month. Each week we will then create a distinguished post (when the green mod text appears), and have an open discussion about that particular section. The final week in the month we will take in suggestions for the three new books to be voted on for the following month, and discuss the entire book as a whole. If URedditors find this to be a useful or worthwhile project, we will look at ways to expand it. 

&gt;I have posted three books as suggestions in the comments, next month you all will be making the suggestions, and they can be newer selections.

**Discussion courses** are great for classes where there is a great demand for a subject, identify content that the class will read, and then discuss either in their subreddit or even a chat room of sorts. Keep in mind this sort of course will not be ideal for all subjects, and we will be launching a trial philosophy course to get things rolling before we open it to everyone. I will make another announcement next Friday with the offering.

**FAQ**


* Need help getting started? [Read our FAQ section](http://ureddit.com/help). 
* Want to create a class? [Here are some suggestions](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJskAtBQO0c). 
* And our open calendar of classes can [be found here](http://play-this.org/university-of-reddit-class-schedules/)

**Teaching a class:**

Are you a Narwhal hunter that can deliver content on a regular basis that can contribute to a new line of Narwhal hunters? If so, and it’s easy to bite off more than you can chew. In the future we will be launching a new way for you to teach, so having quality content will be in your favor later on. Also, to declutter this subbreddit, please don't post interest check posts here any longer. Just create the course on UReddit, with a completed lesson plan, then share it back here. You would also want to message the mods with your schedule so we can add it to the calendar.

**Taking a class:**
Taking a class is simple. Find a new offering on this subreddit, or updates on this subreddit. If you can't find the course content, reach out to the teacher. The teachers are in complete control of their content, schedule, and material, so unless someone reports an inactive or empty course we may not see it. We do our best to clean content on a daily basis though.

**Requesting a class:**

Don’t see a class or one that does not have an archive of content? Request a new one! We have a specific subreddit for these, keep in mind you are among millions of members on reddit. If there is a subreddit that relates to the course or subject you want to learn about, cross post your request and let them know you are interested. You may be the reason and inspiration that gets the course to start rolling. If all else fails, message the mods, and we will setup an open discussion course with you as we try out the new offering.

It has been a long time since I have posted. This is because we have all been hard at work

Lets just get the bad news out and over with: Since the last time I wrote out to you all

Now to the good news: Over the month, why not make this an organization to teach and promote bio-science education and research. 

And we did.

We have created an organization which we hope can self-sustain itself over the next few years, structure all planned out.

Why not allow it to be a great experience for both the Lecturers and the students? We now offer Lecturers to gain solid work experience. Not only is the work experience applicable for Scientist

We are aiming at people with little to no work experience, helping us teach a wide range of different Bio-science areas, exploring new research and old a-like.

The theory is build by Richard Boyatzis and describes a frame work for creating change at an individual level all the way up to a global level.  We'll cover all levels with focus around teams and organizations.

I do not have a BS yet

The objective of the course would be to gain an overview of the majors typically covered in first semester organic chem (acid / base applications, and major reagents).  **No previous chemistry experience is needed**.  I'm confident that, if you are a good listener and just like to pick up skills, you will be able to follow a conversation and workout out some synthesis problems on your own.  We could even cover some illegal drug chemistry ;)

The class would likely be about a dozen ten minute videos on a whiteboard or paper.

So chime in if this tickles your fancy.

______________________________________________________________________________________________


**Course Description**: The aim of this course will be to survey some of the main texts in ancient Greek literature (in English translation) and to discuss the cultural themes contained therein. I plan to offer around 15 weeks of guided reading and discussion while we read the following forms of literature: 1) Platonic dialogue, 4) Lyric Poetry, 5) Epic Poetry, and 6) Historical Prose. Themes we will cover include irony, mythology, cosmogony, women in antiquity, Athenian democracy

**Prerequisites**: An interest in ancient Greek culture and literature are a must! Otherwise, so I will assume little to no reading knowledge of ancient Greek.

**Qualifications**: I am currently an undergraduate student of Philosophy and Classics. I will be entering my senior year next semester, I have tutored for two years, which should help me to provide adequate instruction.

**Schedule**: The course will start in one or two weeks if enough people are interested (hopefully around 10). I will post a document that explains the historical background and significance of each reading as well as a section-by-section commentary that explains otherwise confusing references to ancient Greek culture. I will also post discussion questions that will allow students to interact with one another while examining these texts in more depth.

Tentative Reading Schedule:

1. Plato on Poetry
2. Homeric Hymns
3. Hesiod - *Theogony* and *Works and Days*
4. Sophocles - *Oedipus Tyrannos* &amp; Aristotle on Tragedy
5. Aeschylus - *Agamemnon*
6. Euripides - *Medea*
7. Aristophanes - *The Frogs*
8. Aristophanes - *Lysistrata* &amp; Sappho (Lyric Poetry)
9. Lyric Poetry &amp; Pindar - *Olympian Odes*
10. Homer - Selections from *Iliad* and *Odyssey*
11. Herodotus - Histories
12. Plato - The Trial and Death of Socrates
13. TBA
14. TBA
15. TBA

Note: I am open to revisions of this schedule. I am covering the various forms of literature in broad strokes and have left out quite a bit.

Thanks for reading! Feel free to comment on any aspect of this course

**Edit:** Please comment to express your interest and any suggestions about the course schedule.

I'll prepare what I'm going to cover based on what I think you guys will find interesting and look into potential reading materials (which I of course will make freely available).

I would like to teach you guys a shit-load of IR 101 material but with this being an online class - and completely free and non-compulsory - I'll try to get in the basics (which can be boring and hard to comprehend at first) as quickly as possible in order to get to the fun stuff (e.g. why two-level game theory has become the de facto way in which international actors operate on the world stage). 

I'll begin to create a syllabus and from there create course notes that I'll make available to you guys. However

I created this subreddit for the course: http://www.reddit.com/r/IR101/

Future updates will be posted there. Please subscribe so that you know what's going on. Also, whatever, please post it in the subreddit. 

@Airaieus: Yes, avoiding conflict, is a major part of IR, in theory and in practice, so it will be covered extensively.

""大家好！(Hi everybody!) I'm your other lǎoshī (teacher). I've recorded audio of the 5 tones to a site called chirbit.com. You can register there and search for my username, I'll give you feedback here.""


Hi
or concerns. Now that that is out of the way

Before goaway or I begin to teach you words

**I) Tones**

In Mandarin Chinese there are a total of 5 tones. There is the neutral, third, and forth tone.

*First ā*

The first tone — is marked as a straight line. Think of it as a higher pitched sustained sound.

*Second á*

The second tone ⁄ is marked upwards. It is a rising tone so start from the lower part of your voice

*Third ă*

The third tone V is marked down and up. It is a low and curved tone. Think about dropping your voice down and then bringing it back up again.

*Fourth à*

The fourth tone \ is marked downwards. It is a falling town

*Neutral a*

The neutral tone has no mark. It is a short and light tone.

**II)Pronunciation**

Pronunciation of Chinese words can be broken down into two parts. Initials and Finals. The Initials are generally the first or first two letters in the pinyin word while the finals are what follows.
For example in the following zhang1 (the number at the back denoting what tone it is

Included below are some guides (taken from wikipedia) regarding their pronunciation.  

[General Pronunciation Guide](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinyin#Rules_given_in_terms_of_English_pronunciation)

[Guide to Pronouncing Intials](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinyin#Pronunciation_of_initials)

[Guide to Pronouncing Finals](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinyin#Pronunciation_of_finals)

[Another guide to Pronunciation!](http://chinese.yabla.com/chinese-pinyin-chart.php)


A difficulty you might face when speaking is that getting the sounds to sound exactly right.  One of the challenges, as if you're blowing something out of your mouth.  The air is rushing between your teeth.  While the ""q"" sound is like you're trying to whistle, you will not be blowing your breath between your teeth, and it'll be blown down towards your lower lip.  So something to experiment with is utilizing your tongue, teeth, and all other parts of your mouth when speaking.  This will help with getting more accurate pronunciations which ultimately will make speaking much easier for you and your listener.  Additionally, as a side note

Once you feel comfortable with pronouncing the basic initials and finals of pinyin you should try to utilize the tones in conjunction.  More will be added on this topic later.  I hope this has been helpful

**Additional Help:**

I can set up personal lessons regarding speaking via my skype

mdbg.net is a wonderful resource as a Chinese to English or English to Chinese dictionary.  It also includes recorded pronunciation audio files that can be played when you click on the word so later on that will be useful,False,self,t5_2rqj9,1370380053.0,,,t3_1fmegw

There will be 4 Live sessions every saturday for 4 weeks. These sessions will be recorded so you won't have to be there to get the knowledge.    
These sessions will be live streamed on [twitch.tv](http://www.twitch.tv/)

And on top of these live sessions, maybe some extra video if need be)

One of the good ways to take this class is to follow the course material while trying to make your own game.

The course will follow the process of remaking this game:
www.scirra.com/arcade/addicting-action-games/4255/neon-platformer

We'll provide the assets

This course is aimed at any kind of user from total beginner to slightly more advanced. The more advanced will probably know most of what will be taught but we'll try to talk a lot about the thinking behind the choice we make. So hopefully they should pick up some good hints.

Also you really don't have to buy the standard version of the software to follow the course (or even to make games)

So please

We've created a [new subreddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/construct2class/) for the class.

Weekly assignments would consist of very short analysis of chosen songs (i.e. choosing a song you like and seeing how it uses the topics discussed in class) and short compositions (i.e. using the concepts discussed that week as a songwriter would. These will likely be written

I've been studying Heidegger in depth for the last two years and would like to start an online course in order to share what I've learned thus far and to help others begin with Heidegger's unusual but rewarding journey.

A little about myself: I have worked as commissioning editor at two undergraduate led philosophy journals (The Journal of Leeds University Philosophical Society and the British Journal of Undergraduate Philosophy). I have some basic experience in a socratic 'teaching' role through taking part in the proctoring scheme at the University of Leeds. Whilst studying at Leeds I earned my first-class honours degree in philosophy. My interests are (generally) technology, phenomenology, and well-being. Examples of my work can be found here:

The inherently quantum effects involved in the phenomenon are rich in complexity making NMR spec. instrumentation a broad and interesting field in its own right.

The curriculum would assume only a knowledge or college physics I


This course would be most suitable for a natural science undergraduate, as the lectures are highly pictorial and both qualitative as well as quantitative, so that anyone who is curious could learn something.

The course is organized as such:

1) Conceptual / qualitative NMR
2) Theory of NMR
3) Instrumentation and technique

It would be wonderful to be able to follow the above *ordering* of topics

The topics would be (subject to change):


**The NMR concept**

1.1 Gyroscopic precession

1.2 Classical spin-orbit coupling

1.3 Larmour Precession I

1.4 The magnetic moment concept

1.5 Particle motion and magnetism

1.6 Spin moments and the Bohr Magneton 

1.3.1 Quantum mechanics basics and the Zeeman Effect

1.7 Nuclear spin and magnetic moments

1.8 LC circuits and spin kicking



**Theory of NMR**

2.1 Gyromagnetic ratios

2.2 Bloch Equations and the rotating frame

2.3 Magnetic susceptibility and NMR

2.4 The quadrupole interaction and NQR

2.4.1 Earth's field

2.4.2 NQR transitions for non-axial EFG's

2.4.3 NQR as a perturbation to The Zeeman effect

2.5 The relaxation parameters T1

2.6 Spin lattice relaxation and spin echos

2.7 Fourier techniques in NMR



**Instrumentation and technique**

3.0 Electronics

3.1 Pulsed NMR basics 

3.1.1 Spin kicking

3.1.2 Tank circuits

3.1.3 Superheterodyning

3.1.4 Duplexer circuits and tricks

3.1.5 Noise 

3.1.6 Noise II



3.2 CW methods

3.2.1 The susceptibility and filling factor

3.2.2 Quenching oscillators





3.3 RF quirks

3.4 Signal amplification

3.5 Signal Processing

3.6 MRI

3.6.1 The problem with high fields

3.6.2 Pulse sequences and Noise

3.7 Filters

3.7.1 The transient response problem

3.7.2 Phase locking tricks

3.7.3 Temperature considerations

3.8 NMR and industry

3.8.1 NQR and industry

3.8.2 NQR as a method of detecting arbitrary substances

3.8.3 Varactors

3.8.4 Open problems in NQR: combing the desert



The above syllabus came from a series I gave in 7 1-hour sessions and do not imply anything about the pace of the course; e.g. they are not equal in length

NMR is still very much under development and input from others would be appreciated and potentially implemented.

Peace

Original post follows:
  
So I stumbled upon this subreddit a month or so ago and since then, but they are almost exclusively creative writing.  My writing background is a little different and I was wondering if people would be interested in a beginning technical writing class.  
  
A technical writing course would cover writing informatively for a technical audience.  It is NOT the same thing as journalism
  
Some of the things we might cover in such a class would be writing instructions, and understanding other types of business writing.  In designing the course for beginners, I would take a ""wide and shallow"" approach, trying to cover a range of technical writing topics without going too deeply into any one.    
  
Pr-requisites would be high school level education in writing in English (your determination if you meet this standard, but nothing required.    
  
If I see interest, it'd probably be 8 to 10 ""classes.""  
  
My BA is in English and my MA is in Technical Communications.  I was a member of STC for a number of years as well

45 lessons (some of which are 2 part) spanning from installing the ide / compiler to hello world, stringstream, simple file I/o, loops, cases, arrays, etc. (roughly 11 hours of verbal content with video)

7 bughunts (Where I post the code and have the users try to find the bugs)

2 challenges (with solutions in case you get stuck)

15 lessons -- from setting up the ide, if / nested if, and nested loops. (roughly 4.5 hours of content)

5 bughunts

I am writing more content literally as fast as I can and would love if I could get a few more people that are advanced in coding to come and help me conceptualize challenges

It would go through the entire production process (concept art, rigging, etc...) and is meant to be more of a ""this is how you make your own film"" rather than ""this is how you use software"". Though

The curriculum would be based on a video tutorial series I would produce and offer on YouTube for anyone to view and learn from. Alongside this, downloadable lesson files, etc... for any students who are enrolled. As well, I would act as a sort of ""mentor"" by giving you what feedback / advice / help that I can.

As a student (depending on your skill level) you will either have followed along and made a copy of the animated short that I create as part of the video series

I intend to turn the curriculum/forum portion into a paid online course (the videos will always remain free). I would hope to use this as a means of funding my own independent projects, I want to offer the first class for free to RedditU as a sort of ""beta"" test and get some feedback.

So if there is interest

* If interested
* If taking it
* Why are you interested in this? As a hobby? To get a job? To produce your own indie animations?
* Any specific requests / ideas / desires for a program like this?

That's all I can think of for the moment. If you're curious about what I can create

**EDIT**

Wow! Thanks for all the interest

* There were a lot of comments showing interest in Blender, GIMP, InkScape, etc...)
* It will take me several months to produce the videos and course
* I'll be posting the videos as they are made, sorry... but it's easier than trying to update through Reddit and have no-one notice.

I'm a 4th year Irish PhD student in cosmic ray astrophysics (Not the best weather here to be experimental!). I would love to give a basic Astrophysics class here on Reddit if my fellow redditors would find it worthwhile. 

My only prerequisite would be some basic knowledge of calculus. Some things I would cover are:

**The Sun:** Has it always been the way it is? How long will it be there? What will it look like in a billion years? What will be its eventual fate? Is it a typical star?

**Stars:** What do we know about them? How are they formed? What keeps them burning? Do they have a min/max size? And how we do know so much about them since they are so far away?!

**Cosmic rays:** (My own research area) Are there particles out there that are more energetic than the ones in the LHC? What makes them so energetic? And why should we care?

**Light:** So it a wave or particle or what? Why is it created in stars? Reddit tells me nothing can go faster than it

**Black holes:** Where did they come from? Is all matter eventually going to be sucked into them? How common are they? What makes them black? How can we detect them?

1. Have you taken calculus before? If you are currently taking it
2. Why would you want to follow a UReddit calculus class?
3. What degree of review would you need before the start of the actual calculus material?
4. I plan on typing notes and drawing figures as necessary to lead the course, and a backup will be hosted somewhere else). Would you prefer live video/audio lectures with interruptions for questions being encouraged? Would you rather read the material yourself and later come to a question/answer session? Is there some other format you'd prefer?

I plan on covering:

1. Brief review (probably one lecture's worth) of basic algebra and precalc
2. Brief discussion on why calculus is needed
2. Limits and the concept of infinity.
3. Derivatives
4. Integrals
5. Some slightly more advanced topics

1371133987.0,1g9pcf,[Class] Introductory Chinese - Class 2 (6/12/13),reynardtfox,61,13,7,"Hi guys, if any of you can find a way to record yourself saying the words or sentences in this lesson and post them in the thread that would be a great way for Goaway3000 and I to check to see if you're on the right track or not.  Today we'll review the third tone sandhi and the half third tone.




**Third Tone Sandhi**

The third tone sandhi can be seen when you see two third tones following each other. What happens it the first third tone of the pair becomes a second tone instead.  So for example

If you had a string of four third tone words the following you would happen: 

Let's say your sentence is: wo3 zhi3 you3 liang3 ben3 shu1

What you end up reading is wo2 zhi2 you3 liang2 ben3 shu1.

The reason why you don't read wo2 zhi3 you2 liang3 ben3 zhu1 is because of the meaning of the sentence.  The sentence reads I only have two books

**The Full 3rd Tone and the Half 3rd Tone**

A full third tone should begin from mid-low to low and then rise to mid-high pitch. But in spontaneous speech

特別好 (tèbié hǎo)
(exceptionally good)	
三百 (sānbǎi)
(three hundred years)	
課本 (kèběn)
(textbook)	

You will probably find that ""hǎo"", they started and stopped low. A third tone pronounced in this fashion is called a half third tone, because only the downward accenting as opposed to the full down then up third tone contour is produced. Nevertheless, the tone mark remains the same in writing.

Hello!  

I'm really excited that this exists on Reddit - I'm a graduate student pursuing a PhD. in Molecular Biology (with an emphasis in cell signalling and disease mechanisms) and would love to dive into teaching a class open for those in the Reddit community with little to no foundation in Science.

If there is enough interest

-how the scientific method works

-very basic genetics (DNA and how information is read by the cell) 

-cell biology (basic structure and machinery of the cell)

-microbiology (basic principles of how bacteria work)

-human physiology and maybe pathophysiology (how our bodies work on a molecular level)

-general lab techniques and how scientists are using them to answer questions 

As my background and main interest is in research, and try to incorporate interesting areas of ongoing research found in scientific journals today.  Also, to make the subject even more applicable, I will include many examples incorporating human physiology into the lectures.  I will also try to get my medical student husband to free up some time to answer medicine/disease-related problems or other questions about the medical profession!

I love science and strongly believe that EVERYONE should have some basic understanding of science and free access to knowledge.  My goals for this course are to introduce busy people who do not work in science or academia to basic biology and scientific methods and hopefully foster an interest in those with little exposure to it!  I will also be happy to answer any questions about research scientists

As such

Please let me know if you're interested!  I will formulate a more concrete syllabus once I get more people to commit to signing up for the course.

Humans adapt to technology very easily. We drive cars without knowing what’s under the hood. We use computers and smartphones much the same way. Among all the different pieces of technology that we use

This course will link everyday experiences with topics that lie at the core of Biochemistry. By studying how our bodies transform sugars, we will follow the transformations of the food stuffs in our breakfasts, lunches and dinners. We will read lectures from Nobel Laureates, we will peer into the active sites of enzymes, and we see how modern medicine deals with things going wrong.

Prerequisites - Some organic chemistry.

SYLLABUS

At its core Biochemistry deals with two direct yet deceptively simple questions: (1) where did it come from

Lecture 1 -- The hemoglobin-oxygen complex: We will interrogate the hemoglobin-oxygen complex using the two core biochemical questions. We will touch upon heme biosynthesis and breakdown

Lecture 2 -- The Electron Transport Chain and Oxidative Phosphorylation: We will trace the source of the electrons that are added to oxygen we breathe to generate water. We will also learn how a gradient of protons is converted into ATP.

Lecture 3 – Structures: We will focus on the structures of FADH2 and NADH. We will also play close attention to the structures of folate, uracil, thymine, cytosine, thiamine and pyridoxine. We will bank on the knowledge of these structures for the familiarity we need as we journey deeper into Biochemistry.

Lecture 4 – The high-carb meal: We will eat a high carbohydrate meal, and around the TCA cycle. Then, we will travel with its electrons up the Electron Transport Chain, all the way to oxygen, to make water.

Lecture 5 -- Glycogen and Fatty Acids: We will store some carbohydrates as glycogen

Lecture 6 – The high-fat, how they are packaged and shipped into the blood stream. We will also travel on a few different lipid cargo-ships in our blood stream.

A little background:
I write music like this: [http://tindeck.com/listen/bowi](http://tindeck.com/listen/bowi) and if you want to learn to write music like that, but I think it's a bad place to start. It delays the creative process too much. New software + new mindset + new vocabulary = huge investment of time before you get to the good stuff, and you don't even know if you *like* writing music!

So what would this thing entail? You'll grab the 30 day free trial of REAPER, make stuff, send it to me, (probably twice a week? we'll see) and I'll be like ""hey, this part is good, this part isn't, and here's why I think that."" We'll do that for a few weeks

* No, an open educational resource that I think is worth exploring.
* A nascent thesis for the course: the ethical themes that both drove and drew Wallace were advancing toward a Buddhist outlook. It's unlikely that DFW had some sort of agenda; rather, and also because I have a little hope that this is actually original thought on my part (!!). So, I'm interested in either developing this idea, or following it, so I'd really appreciate it if someone would let me know if they take this idea and run with it.

(I hope this whole Buddhist thing doesn't come across as New-Agey; overarching ideas enhance reading and interpretation, Jonathan Blow's lecture ""Video Games and the Human Condition"" is very relevant here. ...God, I'm going to love teaching this course.)
**&lt;/update&gt;**

My university offers its students the ability to put together classes other students can take. (Granted, but they do have very high standards for what gets approved as a class.) Basically, if I finished crafting the course for them on [David Foster Wallace](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Foster_Wallace), would there be enough of an interest here that I should put the class on University of Reddit? I expect the course to focus on his essays, short stories, and excerpts of novels. I also expect to group the sections of the class thematically, rather than chronologically

Anyway

**EDIT:** Perhaps you'd like some inkling of what the curriculum could look like? If anyone has any suggestions, or vice versa?

* Broad introduction to him and what the class entails.
* WTF is postmodernism?? Or modernism
* In what ways did Wallace attempt to advance literature formally in his early work? What changed in the transition from *The Broom of the System* and *Girl with Curious Hair* to *Infinite Jest*
* A class would be on Tennis, and either Federer or Joyce.
* We'd touch on parts of ""Authority and American Usage"" in order to flesh out the concept of dialect
* In demonstrating more dialects (I'll almost definitely include at least parts of ""The Depressed Person"" here) we'll also get into some of the depictions of addicts and addiction in *Infinite Jest*.
* We'd have to stop by Wittgenstein at some point
* Hell
* Some time would be spent on the role of entertainment
* ^^ That would naturally segue into pretty deep purpose-of-life stuff, quotes from DFW's interviews, the ""Is love a choice or an uncontrollable condition?"" arguments between Marathe and Steeply in *Infinite Jest*, some of Zadie Smith's beautiful distillations of Wallace from her essay ""The Difficult Gifts of David Foster Wallace"", various things in his repertoire regarding imagining other people complexly, and whatever other else I decide at the time. I'd like this section of the class to fuckin' change lives. I might even split this final one into two: one in which we'd talk about each of the additional readings separately, and then one where we tackle the deep personal stuff drawing on ALL of the class's readings

I mean, did it ultimately fail? Does that affect its value? Or perhaps, is Orin a Hideous Man? How do *Infinite Jest*'s linguistic or image-based motifs add resonance to its themes? What do all of the single-quoted dialogue, inconsistent voicing, and flexible narration imply?) but I can't really go after those without requiring all of *Infinite Jest*.


**EDIT 2:** Thanks for showing your enthusiasm! It actually encouraged me to impulsively make some progress on this =). However, if you just can't wait to start DFW, here's a jumping off point:

The Professor: The professor should have some sort of credentials that can be verified by moderators before they are able to begin teaching a course. The professor would be fully responsible for creating a curriculum.

The Class: The class would be fully online and could use a number of books that can be found online in one way or another. The classes could range from anything such as Knot Tying to Quantum Mechanics. Professors can have homework assignments and can be collected and then posted online without names for other redditors to discuss and grade.

The Students: Participation would be completely voluntary

Grades: Grades could be kept in a reddit that shows all courses that a student has passed and failed and his grade in each of those classes. A moderator could be in control of collecting the grades at the end of each semester from the teachers and posting them online in the appropriate grades reddit.

Redstone is underutilized in the world of Minecraft. A large majority of players in the world of Minecraft tend to keep all of their redstone locked away in a chest, rather than use it to it's full potential.
I want to know how many people on here would be interested in a course on how to use Redstone

**Prerequisites**

Obviously you must own a copy of [Minecraft](http://minecraft.net). You also must have either a Creative save available (preferably a Flatland one) or your Survival save with a lot of Redstone available. Just make a Creative Flatland save

**Schedule**

Most likely a weekly lesson

Huge fan of Minecraft looking to explore unique ways of using Redstone

Howdy

* **Prerequisites:** those of you with an interest in mathematics might find this course interesting and stimulating!  Graph theory as taught at our university is an upper level undergraduate mathematics course, I think a good idea of what discrete mathematics is usually gives you a good start. Many people who have experience with combinatorics or number theory are interested in graph theory, for example.

* **Material:** When it comes to course material, etc.), planarity, real-world models that make use of graph theory, history, etc. etc.  We would NOT cover any topology, however.

* **Schedule:** We are going to try to build this graph theory course around a graduate level one we will be taking, and it will (at least at first glance) last 9ish weeks.

* **About Us:** We are honors mathematics majors (seniors) at a small state university where the mathematics faculty puts emphasis on discrete mathematics.  We have both done a great deal of graph theory research and will hopefully have about five papers by graduation (if it all gets accepted, and smaller, regional conferences. We will be enrolling in graduate school for discrete mathematics (PhD program) next year.  We're just two math folks who love mathematics who really want to help spread the word and educate people about what we do!

 Hello chaps

I see there's been some interest in French for beginners and I'd be more than happy to teach it. It would be French-French rather than Canadian/other-French

I'd be prepared to teach both reading/comprehension and speaking/listening, and for the spoken element of the course I'd like to use something like skype, and get small groups together to practise for a hour or two a week (or as schedules permit). 

If you're interested

:D 

**EDIT:**  
Ok, I propose we work it out like this: The speaking exercise will be available in 2 or three slots across the week: **a weekday early slot (around 8am EST), a weekday late slot (around 10pm EST)** and a floating weekend spot to try to fit in all those who couldn't manage one of the others.

The students in the future will have to let me know if those times are doable, and the 10pmEST slot would be **1pm Aus (11 China**).

I'm working on the curriculum as we speak, reserving a room, navigating a city, emergency visits to a hospital and that sort of thing. If you'd like something a bit different, let me know now, and I'll absolutely work it in.

**I'm thinking that this course should last for around 15 weeks**, other than letting me know how well I've taught you, and perhaps encouraging you to study a tiny bit harder.

For those slightly more advanced students, just to avoid the absolute basics. The second module will probably be something of a refresher, but the third will be dealing with some of the trickier bits of grammar, and will be a whole lot more speaking and listening orientated.",,False,self,True,t3_hy264

^1 ^or ^2 ^Credit ^Hours


**SPRING SEMESTER**
*JAN-APR*

A class built with beginning bicycle advocates in mind. It covers cycling and it's relationship with the sustainability (green,hippyhappyfuntime) movements.

We will touch on the science behind a cycling culture. We talk about transportation economics

During the semester you will learn everything you want to know about bikes. We will talk about bike; technologies, tools, and brands. My goal is to make you feel super comfortable next time you visit your next local bike shop. Be prepared to have a more intimate understanding of your machine. 

Students are encouraged to participate in the final project taking the first steps to help make their community more bicycle friendly. Take action at home
examples; Data gathering, advocating safety and security, proposing a bike rescue or bike share for their community etc.

I am enrolled at a top engineering university and have spent over 6 years of my extra curricular time to the study of the subject. I have received recognition for my efforts and am using this class as a simple way to compile and pass on the information.


Im still finalizing the syllabus but a rough draft can be found on the class page. If you are a student and have material you'd like to cover please message me.
If you have information to contribute or would like to teach with me please message me.


Tldr; Share the road

* How to create a sketch that will help guide your subsequent work

* How to use the Photoshop pen tool to create paths and shapes and masks

* Some techniques and different approaches to completing your illustration that will influence the 'style' of your piece

* Handy layer styles and clipping mask techniques that will speed up your process and save you time.

* Masking textures to shapes to create unique patterns and colors

* Some other various handy post processing suggestions and tips


**What I won't be covering

* Doing vectors with Illustrator

* Using the free-hand pen tool to simulate raster-style brushes within Illustrator

* Spot colors and nifty print shenanigans


...



At the end of this course you should be able to create a full vector (and raster hybrid, masking, texturing or post processing sections. I'll do my best to accommodate whatever you choose to use by suggesting alternatives.

Hello there URedditors! This week we have quite a few updates for you

1. Book Club
2. New annual awards
3. New help video available

* First things first

* Second: Annual awards. When our mod announced that we were asking the community how they would like to distribute the best of awards for 2012

With the unfortunate passing of Aaron Swartz

Based on interactions, we would like to suggest the following teachers be recognized for these awards, and from the list you all can choose which one should receive our special recognition. We’re working with the reddit admins to be able to create stickers and other swag, so once we get those we can send them to the selected teacher as well.

Let me preface this by saying I have no idea if these people are male or female, please list them in the comments.

**Those nominated for the first annual Swartz Award for Open Education:**

/u/sarevok9 He previously taught an amazing course [Introduction to C++: A video guided tutorial](http://ureddit.com/class/23620/introduction-to-c----a-video-guided-tutorial) that has nearly pulled in 6,300 students.

/u/Aznable has been teaching an [Introduction the 3D game art](http://ureddit.com/class/29566/introduction-the-3d-game-art-) course with 1

/u/tanknspank for their ongoing efforts in their [Cooking for one](http://ureddit.com/class/23631/cooking-for-the-single-life) class. There are currently 4

/u/hearforthepuns beginner [Electronics](http://ureddit.com/class/23587/electronics) has close to 4

/u/carlh for his [complete course on programming for beginners](http://ureddit.com/class/37773/a-complete-course-on-programming-for-beginners) that has over 2,000 subs on his subreddit /r/carlhprogramming

Also

**Please upvote the particular person you believe should win our first annual Swartz Award for Open Education in the comments below. Downvotes will not be counted thanks to RES.**

* Lastly we have noticed an increase in questions about how a student enrolls in a course, I can now direct your attention over to a new video tutorial that helps to highlight the step-by-step process for enrolling in a course, and what you need to pay attention to so you can get the latest class updates. You can find the [video here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MctEDfkNUs). Also, if one of you has a British accent and lives in DC I will happily bribe you with some beer if you want to do voice overs so I can replace my terrible one.

A Classical View of Algebraic Geometry](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/3037190647/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=wwwonebadseec-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=3037190647) for the classical picture
2. Go through Hartshorne [Algebraic Geometry](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0387902449/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=wwwonebadseec-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0387902449) for the modern theory of schemes and sheaf cohomology
3. Read Beauville [Complex Algebraic Surfaces](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0521498422/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=wwwonebadseec-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0521498422) for the Enriques classification of complex surfaces.

Why this plan?  The Beltrametti et al book is praised for stressing the geometric motivation of the algebraic machinery of AG.  As someone who has studied some of the algebraic machinery without developing much intuition, Eisenbud and Harris Geometry of Schemes would seem to be essential reading, although not as a primary text.  Finally, my own research is in low-dimensional topology, hence my interest in complex surfaces, although it doesn't necessarily connect directly to my own research.

I should say something about the format of the reading group.  Although I've studied some of this material already, we'll aim to do ALL the exercises.  The main goal of the reading group is to help everyone stay motivated, set the pace, and provide a forum to discuss the material and problems in case people get stuck.  My plan is to post notes I make when digesting the reading and solutions to problems.  Everyone is encouraged to contribute similarly.

I'll aim to start May 21 and go on as long as we can/need.  I'll have some time in the next two weeks to discuss the material if anyone wants to start before then.  Also, polynomial rings, etc.) before we get started, esp. if that material is new or rusty.

Finally

edit: I'm very excited by all the interest!  I hope we can get some good momentum going.  I created a subreddit for the reading group:  [r/AGreadinggroup](http://www.reddit.com/r/AGreadinggroup).

-**2 Truths of Teaching:** you can't teach someone who isn't motivated
-**3 Players in Instruction:** the student
-**4 Aspects of Teaching:** planning, and reporting  
-**5 cycles of Instruction:** tasks, marking period, and course  
-**6 Approaches to Teaching and Learning:** constructivist,  modeling and scaffolding, inquiry-based, and social/affective learning  
-**7 Principles of Professionalism:** persona, community, reflection, mentorship and professional development

Each topic will have several short readings attached to it, the learner and teacher will have a  one-on-one conference of reflective discourse.

The assignments will be rigorous; true growth only happens when we stretch, complex, difficult-to-define situations and working our way through them.  The goal of such rigorous assignments is to make you think in new ways, in diverse contexts, so as to produce deep, authentic learning (i.e. learning that reshapes our being.) 

Course dates are TBD as people continue to express interest, with two weeks given to each topic.  If the class becomes large enough, it will be subdivided into sections based on students area of interest: k-6, 7-12, post-secondary, and adult/corporate training.

1335682910.0,sxwxs,[OFFER] Attention Math Majors : Mathematical Analysis and/or Abstract Algebra!,real_guy,50,10,17,"Hello All:

I am planning to teach a class here on UReddit on at least one of the above topics

To tell a bit more about myself

** Please let me know where you're interests are

EDIT: Thank you

***Abstract Algebra*** (**Class Structure**):

I'd be willing to start right where [SchurThing](http://www.reddit.com/user/SchurThing) ends his [Group Theory class](http://www.reddit.com/r/GroupTheory2012/). It would be great if one could go over the whole class

I'm looking at working through the following chapters from ""Algebra - Michael Artin"":

     3. Fields and Vector Spaces. 
     4. Linear Transformations. 
     10. Rings. 
     12. Modules. 
     13. Fields. 
     14. Galois Theory
    
I am likely to spend about a little more week on each of these topics, but I'd like to contain the class within the summer sessions for schools.

Prerequisites:
Usually an introduction to Linear Algebra or basically a proof based class would be sufficient. SchurThing's Group Theory class would be a perfect introduction to Abstract Algebra. I would highly recommend having a look at it.


***Analysis*** **(Class Structure)**

I am going to be using Royden's classical treatise on Analysis for this. These are the topics I'm thinking about:

    3. Lebesgue Measure
    4. The Lebesgue Integral
    6. The Classical Banach Spaces
    7. Metric Spaces
    8. Topological Spaces
    10. Banach Spaces
    11. Measure and Integration
    12. Measure and Outer Measure
    15. Mappings of Measure Spaces

This definitely needs a good amount of trimming to keep it within the given time frame. I'll be open to ideas from others. This class would also require a good amount of Advanced Calculus. 

Feel free to ask any questions. This is going to be a lot of fun. I'd like to take this opportunity to extend a warm welcome to an amazing summer of learning some mind-blowing mathematics.

However, that you want me to cover. I can't guarantee that I will be knowledgeable about everything, but I will definitely try my best.

That's not to say I don't want everyone, and if you already know some Japanese you certainly *can* take the class, I just don't want you to be bored with it or to think that it will be more advanced than it will be.

Which, and some other topics. So, I want to make sure everyone knows that I am NOT completely fluent in Japanese.

Also, including video lectures and some written notes, but also some real-time interactions. Unfortunately, a lot of collaborative whiteboards, video chats, etc. are rather limited in the number of people that can take part at once (like &lt;10 or so), so the class is definitely going to have to be split up into small groups for these types of things. Also, I think I might need to limit the number of people in the class

**Prerequisites** A satisfactory grasp of the English language and very basic short essay skills. It would also be more useful if you lived in a country like the US, Australia or any nation whose legal system is common, not civil.

**About me** I am more halfway through a Bachelor of Laws degree and basically I'm just writing a thesis for the remainder of my study. I have covered every area of law in my years of research and believe I am duly qualified. 

**Why this class is useful** Access to justice for all people is improved when lay people have a better understanding of the law. It is my opinion that most societies don't facilitate such an understanding. I'm not going to teach concepts that aren't useful to everyday people - basically, required intervention with courts or were charged with a crime.

To be more accurate

A little about myself:

I am a first-year graduate student in physical chemistry.  I have taken and done well in Quantum Chemistry, Differential Equations, Modern Physics, Physical Organic Chem, and Physical Inorganic Chem - all of which are relevant to quantum.  It was only two years ago that I found myself heading into what most chem majors consider the deep end.  I ended up really loving physical chemistry.  I have some teaching experience, and I feel like everyone who's interested could benefit from this (myself included).

If you:

* Are majoring in chemistry and are about to take p-chem.

* Know someone who is about to take p-chem and would like some help.

* Would like to brush up on your previous knowledge of p-chem.

* Are just plain curious.

Post in this thread and I will pm you.  If I get enough interest I will create a subreddit for the course.  It will not be operated like a regular subreddit - I will be on at specific times that work for as many people as possible.  A lecture topic will be posted by me at the announced time, raising your hand will be as simple as posting in the discussion.  Common questions and misunderstandings will make it to the top if enough people participate and it will be very easy to hone in on the important issues.

Topics may include (but not necessarily in this order):

* An overview of relevant calculus with examples (triple integrals, partial derivatives.

* An introduction to operators.

* The Time-Independent Schroedinger Equation.

* The One-Dimensional Particle-in-a-box.

* The Two-Dimensional Particle-in-a-box.

* The Three-Dimensional Particle-in-a-box.

* The Finite Well.

* The Uncertainty Principle.

* The Harmonic Oscillator.

* The Rigid Rotor.

* The Hydrogen Atom.

* Legendre Functions

* The Physical Interpretation of the Wavefunction.

* Spin and Pauli Exclusion Principle.

* Variation Treatments for Simple Atoms.

* Vibrations and Rotations.

* Any Suggestions.

1321973991.0,mlhqj,[Interest Check] Flight -- For Beginners/High school students/non-specialists,garage42,42,8,9,"Let me preface this post by saying the following; I am a high school physics teacher


I had a number of students come to me a few weeks ago asking if they could continue to launch rockets after our in-class water rocket project was completed. Naturally, ""Can we do an after-school club dedicated to learning about flight?""


So


The caveat here is this; if you have a physics/engineering background, ""You're over-simplifying things here"". That might very well be true, but the point is not to get super technical, the goal of this course would be to talk about flight to people who have little/no background in the topic and would like to build their own flying devices along with just reading and discussing them.


The course would be of an indeterminate length, (asking fellow ""UofR classmates"" to comment and assess your work based off of a rubric) and you would be required to submit short writings and videos of your completed project to garner credit for the course (credit here being fictitious, of course, but I would want to give assignments).

A few words about myself: I was born in Ukraine with Russian as my first language. I currently live in the US but I still speak Russian at home

I think a live class would be too difficult so I was thinking that probably on a weekly basis I would put out a set of notes on the week's topic along with a sound file of me pronouncing the Russian in that week's notes so you guys get a proper pronunciation down.

**EDIT**: I have gotten lots of great suggestions, but I have decided that most likely the lessons will be in the form of Youtube videos. How does that sound?

How should we behave towards each other? An overview of the main positions in contemporary ethics; consequentialism

How do people make decisions? Rationally? Emotionally? Unconsciously? The evidence from the psychology of judgment and decision making shall be examined.

**Dungeons and Dragons

*Learn to play, or both!*

I'm pretty sure all of you have heard of DnD or had the desire to play it at some point. This course will give you the chance to learn in an environment where you can ask questions and get tips for playing. More experienced players are welcome as well because DMing(dungeon mastering) tips and tips for players will be taught as well after the basics are covered. Come pick up a lifelong

I've been playing and DMing DnD 3.5 (and a few other systems) for about two years now. I currently manage the [r/rpgrecordings](http://www.reddit.com/r/rpgrecordings) subreddit (an offshoot of [r/rpg](http://www.reddit.com/r/rpg) which is a fantastic subreddit) that focuses on people who have recorded sessions of their RPG games.

I'm making this class on a whim to see if people are interested. If interest is shown we can start talking about times and format. Right now I'm thinking of combined text and voice chat lessons and possibly screen casts. Having a voice chat server appeals to me as you all can ask questions as I ""lecture.""

Here are some possible course topics (this is not complete)

For players:

**Basics:** How to play

**Character Creation and ""Advanced"" Character Creation:** How to go about making a character from scratch. Where to find more options for your characters. How to create a solid back story and personality for roleplay.

**Roleplay tips and table etiquette:** How to become the favorite person at the table. When to speak up, advanced roleplaying tips, character evolution. Manners and how to make the DM love you.

And more!

For DMs 

**Basics:** How to DM. What it's like on the other side of the screen. ""Kick down the door"" vs ""roleplay"" group moods.

**World Building:** How to make a living, layers, history and more. Much more.

**Misc tips:** How to organize your game, interesting tidbits, anything I can think of that doesn't fit the other categories.

DnD is something that has been very positive in my life

**EDIT**

Wow! It looks like there certainly is interest. This will definitely be getting off the ground in the coming weeks!

**IF YOU REGISTERED READ THIS**

Class time will most likely be one hour long

If you registered, and what you hope to get out of the class (DM tips, how to play, all of the above, etc.)

So far it looks like the class will be about six-eight weeks long

**Week One** Thursday, races section, combat section, and as much else as you feel like. Don't read for comprehension, just skim it very lightly. 

**Week Two** Wednesday

Thu: Table etiquette and RP tips. How to not be hated at the table. General rules to follow to have a smoother gaming experience and make friends at the table.

**Week Three** Thursday

**Week Four** Wednesday

Wed: World building. Creating a living breathing world for your players and yourself. Maps

Thu: Dungeon Mastery. This is where the huge amount of DMing advice will be. This might be an extended class period

So that's the basic schedule. Four week class. Don't forget I've never done this before

1366615124.0,1cunvl,[Offer] Introduction to programming language theory!,possiblyquestionable,35,5,10,"TL;DR: programming languages is awesome

Do you like programming for the sake of both problem solving and subsequently coding it up? When I started programming, it always just fed my fascination with them. This eventually became an academic interest and it continues to blow my mind each and every day. (I'm only slightly exagerating here)

During my freshman year of college, it was kind of satisfying. As cool as that was, it never really appealed to me; it felt as if I was just taught how to use a language that I didn't feel like I would ever use in practice (anyone here ever heard of OCaml?). But one day, my professor wrote a short snippet:

    let empty key = failwith ""not found""
    let update map key v = 
      fun x -&gt; 
        if x = key then 
          v
        else 
          map x

and when we copy and pasted it into our interpreter

    let map = update (update empty ""hello"" 42) ""world"" 43 in
    map ""hello"" (* this will return 42

in effect

    def empty(key):
        return None
    def update(map
        return lambda x: v if x == key else map(x)

whoa! That got my attention. I may never use OCaml in the real world

A rough syllabus:

1. Introduction to Lambda Calculus. Lambda Calculus is just the language of substituting one thing for another, and we're going to directly *encode* them into our tiny little language. It's like trying to fit a square peg into a circular hole, and succeeding :)
2. Operational Semantics - When we define a language
3. Induction for the manly man/woman - Programming languages are discrete structures that have smaller parts that share similar features; almost as if these features are ""recursive"" (look at a picture of an abstract syntax tree). As such, and even properties of those proofs by induction. Unfortunately, the kind of mathematical induction most frequently taught in school is typically either difficult to use here or are sometimes not expressive enough. We will address this via a generalization known as well-founded induction principle.
4. Semantics by Translation - Sometimes
5. Some cool language features - mutable data in lambda calculus, pairs/tuples, lazy evaluation semantics, modules, concurrency, continuation passing, random and probably useless features that sound really cool and might be fun to hack around with
5. Axiomatic Semantics - Assigns meaning to a piece of code as a proof of its correctness (and from that proof, don't worry, I won't make you write your own theorem prover (although that is an active area of PL).
6. Denotational Semantics - Translation of a programming language into mathematical objects! It's more exciting than it sounds
7. A bit of domain theory - recursion for denotational semantics
8. Types - there's so much to cover here
9. More domain theory - in order to mode recursive types
10. Even Moar Types!

**Neural Basis of Cognition and Learning/Memory**

The brain is an incredibly complex structure that is still far from understood. Neuroscience as we know it today flourished only in the past century; the advent of advanced imaging techniques has enabled us to learn much more

This course will be focused on the neural basis of cognitive functions. The textbook for the course is Cognitive Neuroscience and Neuropsychology, but I have myself taken decently detailed notes on the entire book and will be distributing them. 

The class will be heavily supplemented with journal articles. Select readings from Kandel's Principles of Neuroscience will be distributed. Occasional excerpts from other texts will be provided.

Here is a list of relevant topics. Not all will necessarily be covered.

* Methods
* Hemispheric Specialization
* Motor Control
* Object recognition
* Spacial processing
* Attention
* Language
* Learning and Memory
* Executive Function
* Emotion
* Plasticity
* Cognitive Disorders

**Prerequisites**

A good introductory course in neuroscience would be very helpful. A course in neuroanatomy would also be very helpful

Those that have not had any education in neuroscience should contact me for direction in how to prepare for this course. If you have no neuroscience background and plan on buying the book

Our weekly discussions are quite simple. I'll seed a few questions up here, and if you are joining us late, there will be spoilers.

**Starter Questions**

* By the completion of chapter 6 we find out that the Time Traveler has not only identified a surface dwelling species of man (Eloi)

* Previously the Time Traveler was wrongfully identifying the Eloi as a communist culture, technology, and true freedom to roam). Are there any other political outcomes we can see coming from Well's story that relates back to modern culture? (Ex - Cultural classes and boundaries)

* On page 68 (depending on your version) the Time Traveler discusses artificial selection. ""We improve our favorite plants and animals-and how few they are-gradually be selective breeding; now a new and better peach, now a more convenient breed of cattle. We improve them gradually, because our ideas are vague and tentative, and our knowledge is very limited; because Nature, too, is shy and show in our clumsy hands."" Here we see another detailed description of of a scientific method. Do you feel that combining fact and fiction provides a stronger base for believability?

* Any other questions or issues to raise from chapters 1-6? Add them to the comments!",self,t5_2rqj9,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/UniversityofReddit/comments/16terj/book_club_discussion_2_the_time_machine_chapters/

* Graphical improvements or re-imagingings
* Script rewrites or entirely new stories
* Level editing
* Adding entirely new features to games
* Translating games from one language to another

*****

As far as the class goes I'd like to either focus on translation hacking or general ROM hacking, tackling compression schemes, hacking menus, etc. General ROM hacking would be stuff like modifying crucical game data (enemy stats, spells, items, whatever), graphical hacking

# So

* What type of hacking you're interesting in: **translation** or **general**?
* What system you're most interesting in hacking: **NES, GBA, or other**?
* Any game in particular you're interested in hacking or think would set a good example.
* How much experience you have with emulation/programming in general?

**Edit:** Now that I've thought about this a bit more

Note: I specialize in GBA games, or N64 since they are much more complicated and IMO, unsuitable for a beginner.

*****

Class Structure:

I'd prefer to do this in a group discussion format. Some form of chat with me screencasting would be ideal. I've only ever taught people over IM or IRC before and video would definitely help. I've never screencasted before so I'd really appreciate any advice on this.

I'm interested in how this project could work

I used UoR as a place to turn in assignments and make sure only those enrolled would be graded. The subreddit was for posting lessons.

I recorded some information about the class, but you can get a clear picture of how it went.

The University of Reddit class page can be found [here](http://universityofreddit.com/class.php?id=55)

What this is: It's a course I thought I'd run when UoR got started, and I enjoy it.

However, but I like having live feedback and discussions while drawing, it makes it worth my time. I do my lesson live, then use that 2 hours or so to condense that knowledge into a smaller video packed with information. You don't have to know how to draw, and if you don't, you can learn to draw basics and get decent results by following my tutorials.

So I've been debating whether to start a class for some time now. I'm a recent law school graduate that just took the bar in July. I have some down time before I start working in November and thought it might be an ideal time to run a class on Constitutional law.  Given Reddit's aversion to all things police

I'd be willing to throw together a syllabus and host a few live lectures a week
  
Another consideration is, I'd use the socratic method (for those of you who don't know what this means, it's when the professor calls on students at random to ""brief"" cases. An extreme example and mandatory viewing for all law students comes from [The Paper Chase](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZJEhlIefxA)). This could give redditors outside the legal profession the opportunity to experience how a law class is run and perhaps show redditor contemplating law school what they'd be in for. I'm not sure, however, exactly how we could pull this off over the internet.

Anyway, I'd be happy to set up a class page and we could take it from there.",,False,self,t5_2rqj9,False,,
