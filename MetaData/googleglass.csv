This Googler was wearing a current prototype and explaining some of the functionality. The Googler even let me try it on. It was amazing. 

It's difficult to describe but it gives the impression of a screen sitting a few feet in front of you. The display was very crisp and clear. It's quite unobtrusive when it's off but if you look up or tap it, translate) and it executed them almost perfectly (it gave the wrong search results one time but everything else worked great). It somehow manages to pack in all of the functionality that you would want from a smart phone and put it in front of you in a hands-free way but then get out of the way when you don't need it. 

What struck me more than anything else were people's reactions to it. By the time we were done a decent sized crowd had gathered around and were hanging on every word that the Googler said about Glass. This was a tech-savvy crowd but everyone could sense that they were witnessing something special. I've never seen people react to technology in this way before. It was a really cool experience.

Saturday I got my Glass from Google at the NYC facility. And it was unexpectedly about 100% MORE awesome then I thought it might be. It already was going well because I decided that myself and my friend would wear our fancy pompous outfits that double as part of our steampunk costumes (My friend is in the red coat and top hat

You see

Google, the woman behind the desk excited asked ""Are you the one getting knighted?"" and I was very surprised as I thought it had gone unnoticed. I affirmed that I was, and she sent a signal off to the other room and asked me and my friend Francesco to stand off to the side for a few minutes.

All of a sudden we heard some Monty Python-esque music coming through the door, hooked my arm in hers and we were off! As we walked through the door into the next room, there were two lines of Google employees that fancily bowed as we passed by each pair.

I was lead to the stage at the end of the room and asked to take a knee. As I knelt

A Google employee then approached at a gesture from the man holding a sword and held out a case for me to take my glass from. I placed it on my head (slightly difficult with a top hat) and looked up at the man, Explorer of Google!"" and tapped my shoulders, before asking me to rise.

There was applauding and everyone was enjoying what had just occurred. As all the employees came equipped with their own Glass sets

I carry a slight request from them to you.

While not all requests can or will be honored, my message is for people to feel free to attend in costume as we did, post in some fashion (where Google can see it) a request for how your experience can be special, not just for you but for the hard working people that are helping you set things up. Please, do be sensible, but above all have a good time!

I am not an official Google spokesperson (though I'd gladly use my Robotics Engineering degree to aid Google if there was a place for me!) and so of course my statements should be taken as simply a message from me as a random denizen of the internet.

I look forwards to seeing what you all do when your time comes!

Marcus

tl;dr: Google knighted me when I picked up Glass. They may be willing to fulfill other requests if you let them know in advance. I am not a Google Spokesperson.

Then came the cell phone. For many, where people wondered what sort of value something that takes just as long as a phone call and has limited text size could be.

What these people failed to realize was that each of these services, or that they were in need of help) and had even more to tell several people at once that only required a few seconds and wasn't urgent.

This is the same sort of crowd that completely misunderstood the Laptop (""who needs to carry around a computer?!?""), then TV boxes (""Who honestly wants to watch Youtube videos on their TV together?"").

These same people are now the people that use a desktop at work for high-productivity, their TV box to watch Netflix and Hulu, and their phone to fill in the gaps. **These people, time and time again, only see the product at its most basic level when introduced and fail to see the functionality of its future.**

These same people always sound weird alarms, and so much more.

**Google Glass is going through the same ringer right now.** False alarms about personal privacy

Every new technology that succeeds answers a question we always have

So, any reviewer, any app designer, and any consumer who keeps this question in mind will immediately find the value in Google Glass.

**Google Glass is for when you're walking, driving, standing on a bus or metro train, moving around the grocery store, cleaning the house, or any time you need to minimize distraction.** Each of these situations are moments where using your phone or other device can get awkward, inefficient, high speed

Glass will be meaningful for me when I want to navigate while I'm downtown  and don't want to look like an idiot glaring at my phone. It's for when I'm standing on the metro and want to hear news updates or listen to NPR/Music without having a cable running down my jacket. It's for when I'm busy cleaning the house/putting away groceries/mowing the yard/cooking and I need access to a tasklist, at a press conference, or full-screen gaming and still want to be able to get notifications/take pictures/look polite like I'm paying attention. It's for when I'm watching a sporting event live and want up-to-date stats without looking away. It's for snapping an action shot, getting a pic of that guy who just did a hit and run, and stitching together video from different parts of a hike. It's for taking pictures on a vacation or excursion without ruining the experience by turning the attention of the moment to the process of taking pictures. It's for calling Mom and Dad when I'm somewhere cool so they can share it with me as if they are there. It's for throwing alarms and meeting reminders in my face when I'm working my way around the office doing work away from my desk.

I even personally believe it would make me more productive and safer. Wearing glass, and Facebook tabs at work, knowing that anything I care about going on will be delivered to me. While I'm driving, I will be able to do all the things that most people do while driving anyway (almost everyone today navs off their phone or switch music/text while you're at that stoplight).",,False,self,False,t3_1e30lp

Google Glass has a series of Labs experiments that can be enabled on engineering or userdebug builds. Using APKTool

To start, type in a root shell

`setprop persist.lab.ok_glass_everywhere true`

and restart the Glass home screen.

This is tested with the Xenologer modded APKs for Nexus 7.

If you have an actual Glass (lucky you)

So far

### Known working labs

DEBUG_LAUNCHER: Adds a new option in Settings -&gt; Device Info -&gt; Start Launcher; brings me to the standard Android home screen.

OK_GLASS_EVERYWHERE: you can say ""OK Glass"" even if you are in a different bundle than the home screen; e.g. in the Settings app.

WEB_BROWSING: When you use Glass to Google something

WINK: Adds a ""Wink"" option to the Settings bundle. I haven't installed the GlassGestures APK which contains Winking-related code


### Labs that may do something on the Glass but won't work on a Nexus 7

GCAM: No visible effect. Calls Camera.startGoogleCameraMetering when an app takes the Camera; no clue what that's for

GPS_DEBUG_CARD: Just gives a new blank card in the Settings bundle.

SEARCH_FEEDBACK: No visible effect.

VSTAB and VSTAB_CALIBRATION: Enables video stabilization as seen on http://developer.android.com/reference/android/hardware/Camera.Parameters.html#setVideoStabilization%28boolean%29 . I did not even bother to try this on the Nexus 7

The costs wouldn't really be that much considering some of the other equipment that is bought for police officers these days

It would remove the My word against His word scenario giving credence and support to the reports officers file after every incident as well as protecting the civilians sides of the story.  It would offer up a documented level of truth to any case that would be pretty hard to argue.

It would hold officers accountable for their actions and would combat abuses of authority and power resulting in the building of more trust in the police from a civilian standpoint.  It would also serve as a means for combating corruption as well.

1371418894.0,1gh5lw,My First Weekend With Google Glass,CodyOdi,38,8,16,"I figured I'd share a blog post I just wrote

On a typical weekend I usually sleep, and usually spend some time working on projects. This weekend was anything but typical. On Friday I had an appointment to pick-up Google Glass in New York City, which is about 850 miles away from me. I left Thursday night, and despite a minor accident between myself and a semi-trucks left over tire tread I made it there without a scratch. In fact, I ended up arriving 2 hours early and lucky for me Kirsten was able to get me in early.

After setting down my bag Kirsten lead me over to a table with Google Glass  in every color where I was able to try them on to see which color I liked the best. Honestly, this was a color I planned on getting initially just because it’s such a bold color. Unfortunately I tend to wear a lot v-necks in all sorts of colors so I don’t think it’d match my wardrobe that well, for someone with mostly neutral colors I’d strongly recommend this color though. I then tried on Sky and in all honestly I almost left with them, however going back to matching my wardrobe, I also attend Northern Illinois University so red is one of my go to colors. Then I tried on Cotton, which was the color I picked when I first scheduled my appointment, after a moment of hesitation I decided to stick with it. It’s a neutral color that will match anything I wear while still standing out which will hopefully make others feel more welcome to ask questions about it.

We returned back to where I had left my bag and she informed another person that I chose Cotton and moments later he returned with a box I’ve become all to familiar with while waiting.

The fitting process went very smoothly

After I was able to see the projected screen Kirsten walked me through all of the commands and gave me some tips here and there to better use Glass. While I could have figured this out on my own

After she had walked me through everything and made sure that I knew what I was doing she walked me to the elevator. While I was waiting for the elevator I bumpted into the manager of the pickup location and after explaining how I drove all night from Illinois he offered to make a stop on another floor to grab a coffee and snacks for me. I can’t refuse free food and coffee, nor would I have ran into a couple that broke my “Is that Glass” cherry. Highline Park is beautiful, anyone going to NYC should visit this rooftop garden. The couple were very nice and they seemed to enjoy trying out Glass.

The Questions

I think this would be a good time in the story to talk about the other interactions I’ve had with people. The majority of people don’t say anything about it, another person gave me a thumbs up while crossing the road, one person walked next to me for about half a block before asking about it. “Do you like Glass” is the main question I’ve been asked so far which is usually answered by saying “So far it’s been working how I expect it to work, no complaints.”

For anyone reading this who may run into me

Initial Impressions

Google Glass is still in development. If I wasn’t told that though I’d assume it was ready to be released to the public. This device has worked near flawlessly thus far. The issues I’ve experienced so far include no network connectivity which was solved by creating a hotspot on my phone, and ask Google questions without any issues in both quiet and noisy environments. The picture quality through Glass looks washed out but once I look at them in front of my computer I’m pleasantly surprised by the quality. Are these the best pictures I’ve ever seen? Of course not, but they are exceptional quality for sharing with my friends on Google+, Facebook, or Twitter.",,False,t5_2tumi,True

The first thing this made me think of was [a voiceless communication device like this one](http://www.theaudeo.com/?action=technology). I messaged Project Glass a few times asking if they were considering integrating something like that

So what do you think? Is this solution just too far out of reach? Too expensive? Do you think it's a good idea? At this point I'm considering starting a kickstarter to raise the funding to purchase a dev kit so I can develop a mobile app for the device than can later be used to communicate with Glass. Does that even sound like something people would want? Have you heard of anyone else doing something like this in relation to Glass?

*Pain In The Glass*

I've been using Google Glass constantly for the past two weeks and while is has been useful

**Not Made For People With Ears**

Maybe I'm just overly enthused about wearable technology

**Not Made For People With Eyes**

While I love the transparent prism which project the image for me to see, I've noticed that even after that my right eye begins to hurt after sometime. This is because the prism catches sunlight which is getting into my eye. The same thing happens when I'm driving at night, car headlights seem to get projected into my eye and it can cause some discomfort if there are a lot of cars.

**Not Made For People Attending Lectures**

I've been wearing Google Glass almost constantly since getting them. I take them off every now and then during the day, maybe even allowing me to set a schedule through MyGlass for when to make sounds and when to be quiet.

**Not Made For People Who Walk In The Rain**

This might be nitpicking but while Glass is water resistant

**Made For People Who Love Technology**

Despite the issues listed above I'm still very happy to have Google Glass and I'm still wearing it as much as possible. I didn't write this article for the purpose of scaring people away from Glass,False,self,t5_2tumi,False,,,t3_1hccqe

a top comment quickly changed my perception of Google's free products when it pointed out that this was likely Google's way of tricking consumers into doing the groundwork for a comprehensive 'Footpath' database to enhance their Maps/Navigation tools.




Seeing the specs on Google Glass



Taking that knowledge and using it as a seed to imagine what background processes Google could use Glass for without your knowledge or any detriment to battery life, or even offer a packaged product that will enhance advertisement and reach for a business like that video above. *with a lot of the work being handled by the consumer*






[[TL;DR]] The Augmented Reality Game ['Ingress'](http://youtu.be/PhT1ToPU3WA) is likely a tool for Google to get us to do a lot of the work for them regarding footpath maps and directions.

The text on the screen is very easy to read and really does appear like a 6 to 8 inch screen out in front of you. The audio is awesome, as is the audio and video capture.

Some things I am about to say have been said before. I am just repeating them to say them again. 

Hardware:

•A smaller design

•Maybe more discreet. That might not matter when society gets used to seeing them around. 

•I believe Google said they were meeting with glasses companies. I would love a ""clip-on"" Glass that you can put on multiple sets of glasses. 

•Maybe a ""case"" so there are more than 5 colors?

•Don't just sell them online

•Maybe make the left part of the glass a bigger better battery? Only one half of the Glass (the right) is being used. 

•I realize the $1, but would be amazed if it got to the price of an iPhone. 

Software:

(I am also going to list app ideas

•A RES type tagging system. 

•When they become more common

You are visiting Germany. You don't speak German. You see another person with a Glass on, it would display those words in German on his screen, and vice versa. 

•A ""Only Me"" voice recognition system. So even when it is on

I might be adding things later. Please

In watering places where the disease rages persons who venture to move from one place to another are sure to be stopped by the cry: ""Hullo there! Don't walk in front of my camera

Furthermore, it will not be ten minutes before a dozen or fifteen cameras will be trained upon them. Even when walking quietly in the public street a person is not safe, for not only is he constantly made the victim of the instantaneous process by camera lunatics concealed behind window curtains, but the inoffensive theological student with what is apparently an innocent handbag in his hand, who passes slowly along the street, may have a camera disguised as a handbag and may be taking ""instantaneous views"" without exciting the slightest suspicion. Things have come to such a pass that no lady can step out of a carriage without the fear that every stripe has been surreptitiously caught by a shameless camera, and no man can offer a lady the slightest attention and feel sure that his innocent action has not been forever perpetuated in gelatine emulsion as enduring as brass.

1. If you have T-Mobile what plan do you have and does it work well?
2. Are the plans the same except: 
a) Top one allows me to use my phone or tether for first 4.5GB and then after that I only have 2G access?
b) Bottom plan only gives me 500MB of highspeed data on phone or tethering

Background: I currently have Glass with an iPhone 4s on Verizon. I want to switch to an Android device to get GPS and SMS capabilities and I also don't love that I have to pay $20/month for bluetooth tethering on verizon and so I am planning on switching to T-Mobile due to it being a GSM carrier

Things to keep in mind: 
1. I use 1-2GB of data on my phone (handset only) in a typical month. 
2. This month with the verizon mobile hotspot I've used about 2GB of that data tethering my Glass.

We recently found out the president is going to be here at our school as part of his tour. I am trying to find out if we could get one or more headsets for the kids to film and talk to president Obama using Glass.

I think this would be an awesome opportunity for Google glass and amazing photo op for everyone involved.

If anyone on the glass team can see this or has a contact I would greatly appreciate trying to get a hold of one or more headsets.
