Korea and even though they're adding server clusters, only Korean citizens can play the game because of Nexon's New User Policy (""no foreigners allowed"").  I've been trying to email Valve about this issue but I think I need help getting them to listen.",tagus,2095,567,http://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/1abrti/hey_rdota2_im_an_american_in_s_korea_and_even/

Take for example League of Legends:  a South Korean company licensed the entire game and it's intellectual rights so that they could have their game servers (and client) completely independent of the main Riot Games' version of the game.  They mirror all of the changes that Riot Games makes with a week or so lag to translate everything into Korean and whatnot

In fact

Nexon, probably on the scale of Valve or EA or whatever relatively speaking... but they have a very bad policy when it comes to foreigners.  Even though I have a 외국인 SSN in this country I cannot even make an account on their website!  (Oh, they'll let me register the account, but when it comes to the next step like on all sites: verifying the SSN, they say ""nope! sorry but foreigners are not allowed to play games on Nexon"")

This means no Kart Rider

FAQ:

&gt;But... I heard that Korea had a law or something overturned so you don't have to check your Korean SSN anymore!

The're not doing away with the SSN thing.  The Supreme Court judgment here **only prevented the companies from *directly* asking for your Korean SSN.** The companies now just use your iPin (a government organization that verifies online identities via Korean SSN instead of giving it to them directly) to verify your identity (in this case, whoever owns the LoL franchise here - but not Pmang for some weird reason), which was always an alternative to using your Korean SSN anyway.

So that law overturning or whatever didn't change anything at all here.

&gt;Why not just play on the other regular DotA2 servers then? Fuck the Korean servers...

It is not fair for you to stomp them and it is not fair for you to flame them for being bad at the game.

I'm sorry if the title was confusing. I'm more advocating that the watch button be enabled prior to completion of the tutorial**

Unless something has changed recently I'm pretty sure that in order to spectate games in DOTA 2 you have to complete some of the tutorial missions (please correct me if I'm wrong

Essentially what I'm saying is that there may be many SC2 players and people who have never played DOTA that would like to watch The International

If I'm wrong and this has been changed since tutorials were implemented

**Edit:** I understand that there ARE workarounds. However people that wish to view the competitive DOTA scene in order to decide whether or not the game is worth playing might not a.)  immediately see a tutorial and google how to enable the console merely to avoid the tutorial or b) be discouraged that they have to complete a tutorial for a game they aren't certain they want to play

**Also I am not talking about the whole nation of Russia

**I am also aware the Americans have a similar issue with Brazilians

I used to think Russians were pretty cool, and it seems to be infested with East Europeans and Russians (Russia is technically East Europe I know, but they even have a Russian server!).

I'm pretty pissed so I've devised a list of why I think there needs to be action against the Russian plague

- On the whole
- They have lag and d/c a lot
- They spam chat with Russian symbols which hinders communication for the entire team, and the problem is overcome.
- They seem to rage more than any other nationality I encounter
- When you ask them why they don't play on their own servers

Now, I've met nice Russians too, but very very rarely.

Dota 2 is a **team game**

It would come as no surprise to me if numerous new players get put-off of Dota simply because they have a bad experience playing with Russians in one of their first games.[1](http://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/1bwyd6/this_game_is_making_me_really_racist/c9awhk5?context=3)[2](http://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/1bwyd6/this_game_is_making_me_really_racist/c9ayuso?context=3)

Now, because there's a higher chance of my language being spoken.

Here is a Link: http://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/17dob2/colorblind_mode_seriously_valve/c84nrb2**

Last year, but they were at least thinking about accessibility. This issue means something to me as, while I am not colorblind, one of my best friends is.

He's Red-Green colorblind to a degree that he is almost incapable of distinguishing friend from foe without dedicating valuable time to making the distinction. Put shortly, at approximately 7% of all men having some kind of deficiency. (http://www.hhmi.org/senses/b130.html)

So, but if any of you could please visit the dev forums and show your support in the thread I made about this issue, I would be grateful, and hopefully Valve would see how badly this is needed. 

Here's the link: http://dev.dota2.com/showthread.php?t=35618

First of all, and this is my last semester. I'm studying economy informatics, and I'm writing my thesis on e-sports (I focus on the business models and being involved with e-sports as a job). We have to do a research, and I decided to do interviews. So, **if you are a professional gamer** (and by professional, I mean making money out of it, doesn't matter if salary, **known streamer, but want to help me, I can assure you that I will classify my thesis. I've been trying to find interviewees via other methods

1359194569.0,17b655,Let's talk about what this rage about yet another data mining website is implying.,SeriousLagg,1519,407,759,"**Edit:** Please read [this definition](http://catb.org/jargon/html/H/hacker.html) before going any further.

First and foremost. What I'm about to say does not reflect the opinions of staff and all other editors on the Dota 2 wiki

Now. I was trying very hard to simply ignore this and not add to the mess. But after reading [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/17awec/im_really_trying_to_get_past_all_this_dotabuff/) thread I must at least express my opinion in the hopes of making some people understand how insane the level of delusion is right now.

The fact is: In this day and age where companies like Facebook are trying every single trick they can to get people to give up more of their personal lives and information. Valve has actually done something that works in **our favor** and yet are getting demonized for it.

Let me repeat this again. **Valve**, they are being spammed, called out, threatened, and worse for not reverting it entirely.

Why are people in such a hurry to have their data mined? I am willing to bet that at least some of those doing this spamming are the same people who sign petitions and voice disapproval at Facebook's actions.

I have been a programmer for more than a decade, I wrote OPTF2, and I am an avid fan of reverse engineering and encourage it whenever possible if it is not harmful. So please take this seriously when I say it:

It is still entirely possible to gather statistics on people who consent via an official and sanctioned API. Dotabuff's aim was to become some sort of juggernaut and make money on people. There is no elegance or respect for the community and the hacker mindset in their actions. It was a simple attempt to become **the** statistic website, even in their latest news post regarding invested money). 90% of the time they are lying or otherwise exaggerating the actual expenses. OPTF2 was brought down by load on more than one occasion. Yet I continue to run it completely out of pocket (having just recently introduced donations) for four years. I would have it no other way, because in my projects everyone gets the same quality, and that includes no advertisements.

These people like the genius mentioned in that thread have been egged on by a news post by said website that basically tells people to act in a lynch mob fashion and blame Valve (and **Icefrog** no less who may not even be on the team that made this decision!) and are in other words being good professional victims. They have even went so far as to list icefrog's email address and a direct link to the contact form on Valve's website.

Again, something very rare for companies exposing data these days. And they are buying it with little complaint. I implore you to see the fundamental wrongness in this and not buy their crap.",Discussion,False,,t5_2s580,1359221636.0,d2w,

Rotterdam, and the others seem to be learning, even if their heart is more into SC2.

1346006714.0,yv2id,Thanking Valve for how much effort they have put into Dota 2 especially as an e-sport.,Kinths,1203,235,216,"I'd like to say thanks to Valve for just how much effort they have put into Dota 2. Especially on the E-sport side of things. Valve have done pretty much everything possible to not only support Dota 2 as an e-sport but also to support the players.

TL;DR Just me explaining some problems with current e-sports then me gushing over and thanking valve for just how much Valve is doing to fix those problems with Dota 2.

Full essay version:
So firstly before getting to it, watch and support don't get a steady wage. Their income mainly comes from streaming views and tournament prizes, if they lose they will often get nothing or next to it. Now you may see some of these tournament prizes and be thinking wow that's a lot of money to win. But it often isn't, with the exception of the International most prize funds are pretty low. Remember that the pot gets split between at least 5 people and that money has to last them till they next win money. Not a lot of teams pay for travel costs or living expenses either and sponsors often just give players free gear instead of money. Until they win these players are often working (yes it is a job to them despite how fun you may think it would be) for free.
 

With that out of the way let me get to the point.
Any one who has watched or played competitive LoL (I know it's a dirty word around these parts) will likely know that there is a bit of a  problem within the scene. Some teams are refusing to play games unless they can also stream the games on their own channel. This is because streaming provides a more stable and guaranteed income than tournament prizes.But it takes away viewers from the tournaments official stream meaning they likely can't offer a bigger prize pool next tournament. This becomes a viscous cycle to the point where prize funds will likely get to small for smaller tournaments to attract teams. The players are right for wanting to make money while they play and not just if they win

So how does this relate to DotA 2. Well with Dota 2 valve is doing everything in their power to not only make it an e-sport, tournaments, teams and viewers.

We have the utterly brilliant in game spectator client

We have modifiable team banners that allow teams to show off their sponsors from within the game

We also have the ingenious new pennant system that gives money to  teams regardless of if they win and lets normal players support their team while having a chance at rewards just for watching

Valve has created an e-sport where everybody profits and  it's something that can exponentially grow. The more viewers they get the more the teams earn which means they can make it to more tournaments meaning we get more chances to support our favourite teams while getting loot. Tournaments will make more money as the more viewers there are the more tickets will likely sell. Offering bigger prize pools to players and making it more worth their time. Bigger prize pools will then attract more viewers. It's a repeating cycle that promotes growth for everyone and takes some of the risk out of being an e-sports team

I really don't think people have realised just how big and innovative the features in DotA 2 are for e-sports. E-sports games are starting to get more views than ""real"" sports games and Valve has taken that to heart and created Dota 2 a game that fully embraces the e-sport side of the game. While making it much easier for those who haven't discovered how great e-sport can be to discover just how great it is.

So from Me to Valve: THANK YOU for making something that will hopefully set the standard for e-sports in the future. I always knew Dota 2 would be good but I never expected it to be quite so fully featured. Keep up the awesome work.

I've been watching streams on a daily basis from home and at work (two distinctly different physical locations with different ISPs) for the past 2 years with no problem.

Over the past few months

This is a clear degradation of service.

1346700189.0,zaliu,So you watched TI2 and now you want to play Dota 2. Here is where to start.,Kinths,1116,217,222,"So I've seen a few of these crop up of late. People who have watched the TI2 but are a little confused on where to start with DotA2. This is a few tips just to get you started and telling you where to look.

Firstly, LoL player or one of Banes henchman in TDKR. We are happy that you are here now (Well as long as you're a nice person and not an asshat) Please be courteous to others and make the points of any discussion you may end up in without insulting the other person/s. If you want a better gaming community then it starts with you. Remember that there is nothing to lose in Dota 2 so no need to rage and flame when you are losing. Take a breath and compose yourself. If you rage,flame and think ""trolling"" is cool then frankly we don't want you in our community, I doubt any that any gaming community does want that sort of person.

Secondly to clear up something that seems to be confusing a few people.
Dota 2 is currently in beta and missing some big features (Ie a tutorial) this can be a bit confusing to some considering they're holding big tournaments that hit huge viewer numbers for it already.

To actually play the game you need a Beta key. Here are your options:

1. You can buy one from the Dota 2 store http://www.dota2.com/store/itemdetails/57939587 (which comes with some items for heroes and a spare key to gift or trade to someone)  Don't get it mixed up with the invitational key. That is for something else.

2. Sign up and hope to win the beta key lottery http://blog.dota2.com/ 

3. Find an a amazing person to trade you one http://www.reddit.com/r/Dota2Trade/ (Don't beg for a free key

4. Contests and giveaways

Dota 2 will be free to play upon release. So whether you buy a key is whether you think it is worth it (Hint: it is!)


So you got yourself a beta key by succumbing to the evil and buying a Dota 2 key

Well you play ofcourse :) Start with bot games

The game is even better if enjoyed with friends of a similar skill level

Every hero in Dota 2 is available to everyone for free (or £20 if you bought an invite :P) Those coming from LoL may find choosing a hero at first a little overwhelming but just pick heroes you like the look of and play lots of bot games (You will likely find one similar to your favourite LoL hero) In Dota 2 the only thing you can buy with real money is cosmetic items for heroes (of which you still have a chance of randomly getting for free just by playing)

I hope this helps people

So welcome and good luck! :)

1348556715.0,10fub9,Essentials of Dota: 7 Years of Dota Experience.,El_Fuego,1152,259,310,"**What you are about to read is a foundation of Dota strategy that everyone can build on.** A lot of this is my opinion and I am by no means a professional player but I have a very good of understanding of the game. I will talk about things that carry over to every dota game and change very little from version to version. The hardest part about writing guides for Dota is its in a constant state of change. There are a lot of new players getting into the game and the big question is how do we make these players better before they even start their first game? I hope to solve that problem. So lets get started shall we?


**El_Fuego's Essentials of Dota**


* I want to start with something that allows for all the other ideas to build from. I've decided to start with vision because if you can't see you can't play.

**Vision:**

Vision is so important in Dota that professional teams designate heroes to provide it all game. Yet

* Anyone can and should buy wards. Please, and the 300 spent on buying out the wards becomes less of a deficit. In short, **vision = more gold.** 

**NOTE:** I have many people saying ""Carries never buy wards!"" Yes

* If you are a new player the best thing you can do right away is buy wards and give them to someone who knows what to do with them. You an also ask them where to place the wards.

* Learn how line of sight works and you will instantly become a better dota player, and be much harder to kill while being chased.

* If they pick a stealth hero have your team buy dust/sentries along with wards at start. Its costs a bit extra but when you first blood a stealth hero its going to be worth it.

* **Look at players items before you engage them.** Knowing what your enemy can do is essential to playing on a higher level.

**The map in the bottom left corner of your screen is the best ward you will ever have, and best of all its free**

**Ganking:**

Everyone loves to gank and no one likes to get ganked. **Ganking should happen in every lane at least once.** I have been in so many games where someone says ""You lost as X against Y? That matchup should never lose!""  Yet

* Gank a lane where you know your teammate already has an upperhand. This seems counter intuitive but ganking a strong lane makes your enemy extremely weak and your teammate very strong. It wont be long till that lane snowballs out of control in your favor and you can move on to ganking a weaker lane.

* If the gank is lasting longer than 5 seconds you are setting yourself up for a counter gank. If the gank is successful go push to the tower but only if you have 2+ with you and they are strong pushers

* Gank more at night. Players are less likely to see you and this gives you an upper hand. However

**Positioning:**

Positioning is what separates professionals from the rest of us. Learn it and learn it well because it is required in every game from the moment the creeps spawn to the moment the throne goes down. It is used in laning, and farming. One can know every hero like the back of there hand but if they don't know positioning they don't know Dota. I will try to give tips but this is such a subtle concept that one can only get a true grasp of it by watching professionals and high level games. **Do you want to be a great Dota player? Make positioning your priority.**

* If there are no heroes on the mini map stop farming and get back. Stay out of your jungle and hug a tower because more than likely you are being hunted. This is very basic positioning but often times it is the most important and the most forgotten.

* Don't ever take the high ground without vision

* Teleport Scrolls are a must. **I often buy two so I always have one ready.** They allow you to do so many things, escape, and save you so much time.

I am not going to explain team fight/gank positioning because they vary too much from game to game. If you want to get better at team positioning/ganking play AOE/Gank heroes and watch professional/high level games. also

**Communication:**

If you don't have a mic you are actively choosing to weaken your Dota play. **Back during WC3 everyone had to type and ping. It was a communication nightmare and playing with people on any voice program was heaven on earth. Now that its built in people still don't use there mic, setting up a successful team fight, and giving enemy positions on the fly. One can discuss strategy instantly and with a game like Dota instantly is VERY important.

* Ping and call out a focus target**There is no such thing as too much communication in Dota.**

* Don't listen to music while playing Dota. There are too many sounds and indicators that help you stay out of danger as well as pull off successful team combos. You need to be able to hear your team so you can properly work together as a unit.

* Calling out lanes is important but don't forgot to call out key items. Do they have wards/sentries? Did enigma get a fast blink dagger? Who is buying Mecansm on the team?

* Talk to your team about everything. **If I am in a lane and I need my boots but I am giving farm to our carry all I have to do is ask for a few CS and usually they give it to me** Tell your team what you are building and ask them what they are building. The reason for this is you don't want to have two of certain items such as mechanism and pipe of insight.

**Composure:**

Dota is a psychologically and mentally taxing game. Everyone rages but not everyone knows how to control that rage. There are a lot mechanics/strategic expectations that cause emotions to spin out of control. I am going to point out those mechanics and show you that they aren't as big a part of the game as you may think. This is where I inject a bit of philosophy and psychology into my Dota play.

* **First Blood:** We all know the good ol' first blood it means you won or lost the lane right? Wrong. The moment a team lets first blood effect the outcome of a lane/game is the moment you lose the lane/game. What does that mean? **It means gank the guy who got first blood.** If you gank the guy who just got first blood it dampens the effect and gives you back some of what you lost. What if you can't get the guy? Learn from your mistake and avoid being caught in that position again. First blood will matter more if you let it matter because as the the game goes on it becomes less and less of an advantage so long as people don't die again and again. **First blood happens and it can often be because of mistakes but what you need to do is not dwell on the mistake

* **Laning:** Losing a lane does not equal losing the game.

* As a Dota player ALWAYS be prepared to lose your lane. Being prepared to only win your lane and never lose is not the mark of a good strategist **The moment you prepare for only one outcome is the moment you set yourself up for failure.**

* If you lose your lane try to have a different approach ready. It can be anything but make it involve your team with either a gank, if you can convince your team to 5 man gank the lost lane and push it go for it. Five man Dota is a great way to bring your team back to the game instead of dwelling on lost lanes.

* **Live in the moment**
I am going to emphasize a bit more on dwelling on mistakes. Dota is not a game where you can focus on what happened in the past because it moves so quickly. Dwelling on the past and not focusing on the current moment in time can cause you to make more mistakes and eventually it turns into a downward spiral. If a mistake happens keep going because there is no time to discuss it as you are already having to deal with problems in the present for example what do you do after a mistake? Play through your mistakes.

* **Team Morale**
Dota players are their own worst enemies. The player raging, comebacks, enemy over extension, pushes, farming, the list goes on.** How do I know this? I flamed people all the time back then because it was just part of the game. Eventually while watching replays trying to figure out what went wrong I realized I went wrong. Team morale is a MASSIVE part of Dota that is often never discussed when it should be one of the top priorities. When people feel good they make good decisions with sound judgment.

* What do we do with these players? **If you have a friend that rages consistently point it out

That whole ""Thick skin"" mentality needs to die. You are no longer player WC3 Dota and now have a system that puts the children in there place. Absolutely no exceptions.

**Last Hitting/Denying/Farming**

If you get good at this you get more gold and they get less exp. I'm not going to explain the importance of this because its drilled into everyone's skull already. Don't get me wrong you will be a better Dota player for learning how farm well. Some take it too far

* **Big Farma'**

This is going to spark a lot of controversy and I didn't put it in the guide until I saw how popular it was. This is something I feel strongly about and it may cost me votes but it needs to be said.

**A carry is not a one trick pony for late game.** I like to think of a carry as a hero that is designated the most farm and is capable of providing spare gold in times of dire need. Yes

**We often teach new players that a role is set in stone but we all know that Dota is a game of adapting. If we tell people that a role never has to do ""X"" we are not teaching players how to adapt!**


**Final words:**

I love this game and I will be in Seattle next year to watch the next International. When I was 17 I remember thinking to myself ""Wow! Dota is the best game I have ever played online how is it a WC3 custom map!?"" The idea was so awesome to me. I felt like I had my own little secret stash of gaming goodness just for me and my internet buddies to play. Well now the secrets out and the consequence couldn't be better. **Thank you

**Please give reason for down voting so we may discuss your disagreement.**

Thank you for reading.

**TLDR;** Sorry but Dota isn't for the lazy.

**Note:** Wow the discussion this has spurred is awesome! I love the rebuttals and will respond to them soon work take precedence at the moment.

**Note:** I am continuing to edit and improve the guide. Remember this is a **FOUNDATION.** **I know very well how complex a game Dota is but everyone has to crawl before they walk and walk before they run.**

**EDIT** Updated ganking section a bit to make it more accommodating and less black and white. TP scrolls are discussed now in positioning

**EDIT** Added explanations to the vision concepts. Some grammar fixes and I worded things a bit better so concepts were clearer. If someone would like to help me tighten up the grammar that would be great!

Hey r/Dota2

In about 2 weeks time, and we want to be there to capture them for the Dota 2 subreddit community at home.

In the same vein as [r/Games recent subreddit reporters for E3](http://www.youtube.com/user/RedditGames)

*So who are we?* Our small team attended and covered The International with ESFI World last year, we are back at Benaroya, on our own dime, and totally unaffiliated with any Dota 2 or eSports organization. Along with some friends at the event (you probably know some of them!), we're looking to kick some proverbial ass (in the form of content for the subreddit). 

For our interviews, we'll sit them in front of our camera for an interview.

We're hoping to produce *at least* two community driven interviews each day, let us know what you want to see in this thread, and we'll try our best to oblige.

Our coverage does have some limitations; last year, but that will take your help. If you’re going to be in Seattle during TI3, speak English and Chinese fluently, and want to keep us from slumming it on Google Translate, then [send us a message](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=ReaverXai). 

This isn’t just a call for translators either - if you have any way you think you could be of assistance to producing some Reddit TI3 coverage and want to help out

And please, [Flickr](http://www.flickr.com/redditdota2) and [RedditDota2](http://twitter.com/redditdota2). Of course, we'll be sure to share the best stuff here as well.

There may be times when having the courier move at full speed makes it worth it to send back a 1 charge bottle

EDIT:  For those that want more rigor -
Assume 2 trip refill (ie constant bottle crowing).  This is the BEST case for using 2 charges.

regen/sec for empty bottle = 3charges * crowspeed/2.42*d

regen/sec for 2 charge bottle = 2 charges * crowspeed/2*d

regen(empty)/ regen(2 charges) = 3/2.42 after cancelling.  


Conclusion - using all three charges is a 24% increase in your regen/sec over sending bottle back with 1 charge.

Back in Dota 1 if you notice the enemy would try to kill you inside your fountain you could just hide behind the trees in your base to become almost unreachable by the enemy and this often caused them to stop trying to fool around and end the game. In Dota 2 that is completely different because the fountain area is much smaller, gpm and xpm. The only option as a hiding spot in Dota 2 is the area in the middle of the trees right outside the fountain, which is not protected by the fountain and enemies can easily reach you if they saw you hiding there.

[Here's a few pictures of Sentinel (Radiant) and Scourge (Dire) bases in Dota 1. The difference is huge.](http://imgur.com/a/5egJs)

Fountain camping has absolutely no strategic value in the game and it's done just so a few people can feast on the misery of half of the players on the match that must wait for long minutes before the game finally ends since they can't just quit like in Dota 1.

The offlane is the least popular of the three lanes in dota, and decent opponents will exploit that to net themselves an easy first blood. But despair not, slahser is here to help you master the offlane.


First off, dire offlane bottom right. On the offlane you have a long walk back to the safety of the tower, while your enemy is much closer to his. It is therefore very hard to kill the enemy hero, and you are much more vulnerable. To make it even more difficult for the brave offlaner, your enemy has 3 potential neutral creep camps on the radiant offlane, which  he can draw to his lane, whereas you only have 1. On dire offlane he has 1 neutral camp, exp


But despair not. There are some tricks you can use to avoid dying on the offlane, so that they meet as close to your tower as possible, and as far away from your enemies tower. This map shows you what you want to do: http://i.imgur.com/DIa3BDv.jpg 
The black lines are where the creeps naturally meet, wants it to meet, and the blue spots are the creep camps that can influence the creep position.


**Creep Block**
The first step towards achieving perfect creep positioning is also the hardest. This is to perform a creep block. The intention with the offlane creep block is to block all the melee creeps, but deal most damage, the premature death of this creep will make the enemies creeps deal more damage, thus pushing his wave away from the safety of his tower. Here is a video showing me blocking with bounty hunter: http://youtu.be/LiojAfxWFas 

I see this block so rarely (if ever) in public matchmaking

This block takes practice, and let the ranged creep past on accident, thus prompting ""lol nice block noob"". If this happens, just shrug with a smug grin on your face. If, however, you have a lane partner that thinks it imperative to ""fix"" your ""failed"" block by blocking the ranged creep, you have my permission to ping him twice and say ""Good sir, it is also of utmost importance to damage your own creeps as soon as they hit under half health


**Ward Spot**
So you made a perfect creep block, thus denying you an entire wave of exp and gold and pushing the creeps back to their tower. The solution is obvious: buy 1 set of observers in the beginning and ward the enemy neutral camps. Here is the 1 ward spot on sentinel offlane: http://i.imgur.com/7L1XkUe.jpg
And the 2 ward spot I recommend: http://imgur.com/IyEpr0h

This will block both camps. You don't really need to block the small camp close to the tier 2 top tower on dire


**Misc**
What is essential however is that you spawn as soon as possible, since you want to place the wards and be back in the lane to block your ranged creep. You want it to look like this:  http://youtu.be/S20Ggfub8LY
And it could even be done faster than that.
For items I recommend, 1 tango, a salve, and of course 1 set observer wards. For ranged heroes, drop the stout shield and get some branches or a ring of protection instead.

They may counter your block with sentries, depending on the enemy heroes.

Good solo offlane heroes include bounty hunter, clockwerk, clinkz, syllabear and dark seer. Make sure to place wards at the creep camps and block the melee creeps with all of them. Now go out there and show me how to dominate as offlane solo. 

And one last thing: Don't forget to tell your teammates, so they can pick heroes for jungle and the other lanes. Good luck.

Here i use cogs to help me block. Consider this my guide to clockwerk as well. For a more realistic, look around in my match history.

First, even though the tickets were never posted during that time, despite no response from Valve.

Then, and they're not in our cart. We try checking out, but of course there's always an error. The worst part is that it keeps looking like you're about to get a ticket, and then the store breaks again. The whole process is a mess. We walk away with nothing after 2 hours of dealing with one of the most infuriating user experiences I've ever seen.

Then

Any half-decent ticket site would just tell you the tickets are sold out after 10 minutes or whatever. Instead, 45 minute process with the hope of glitching a ticket past checkout. There was never a reliable way to figure out if the tickets were actually sold out, so we just had to keep trying to buy one, and failing to do so. It basically made it feel like they really didn't care about the user experience, or making the process fair. I could have jumped into the process an hour after the announced time and still had about the same chance of getting a ticket.

In case you couldn't tell, not turn the tickets around on *Valve's own market* for a $200 profit. It was a complete waste of my time, and I'm honestly shocked that something linked to so huge of an event was planned so terribly. If you did get one, and you actually *want* to go, then I'm happy for you.

But, when this whole thing should have been done within 20 minutes at most. Additionally, there was no indication by Valve as to what was happening (and that the tickets were being sold in batches), so it kept getting everyone's hopes up and then breaking them. 

This whole thing was ridiculous and I felt like I was just a guinea pig in an experiment to test how much traffic the Dota Store could take

1361286417.0,18tjbo,An important message regarding submitting and voting on /r/DotA2,alienth,1104,399,330,"Hola All

I am an employee and administrator of reddit.com. There has been a recent flurry of incidents surrounding the e-sports related subreddits that need to be addressed.

The problem I'm referring to is 'vote cheating'. Vote cheating simply means that something is inorganically being done to manipulate votes on a post or comment. There aren't many site-wide rules on reddit

* Emailing a submission to a group of friends
* Engaging in voting 'cliques'
* Asking for upvotes on reddit, facebook, skype, etc.
* Using services or bots to automate mass voting.
* Asking people watching your stream to go upvote/downvote someone or something.

The reason this rule exists is we want to ensure, but we do what we can to keep it as fair as possible.

----

Vote manipulation is a very broad spectrum of behaviour. We're not trying to be assholes here, we're going to be more concerned. You all aren't stupid; if you're doing something that feels like manipulation, it probably is.

We have put a lot of work into the site to mitigate vote cheating wherever possible

----

The reason I'm directly bringing this up on the big e-sports related subreddits is that the problem of vote cheating has started to become very commonplace here. It is damn near 'expected behaviour' in some folks eyes

So, consider this your fair warning to stop immediately.

Also, we may ban the site from being submitted to reddit until the issue can be addressed. This is a fairly extreme course of action that we rarely have to invoke, but it is a measure that has become more commonplace for sites common on e-sports related subreddits.

The action of barring a site from being submitted to reddit can only be performed by employees of reddit

Thanks for reading. I'll be happy to answer what questions I can in the comments. I'm a pretty close follower of various e-sports things

I very often end up in situations where I read random comments on reddit, and I'm simply amazed by the assumptions people make. So I decided to help. This guide will tackle in a very simple way a few issues commonly raised.

**1. Matchmaking Basics**

A lot of people seem very confused about matchmaking rating. The knowledge I have is based on information available from dev.dota2.com

Matchmaking rating has nothing to do with how well you perform in the game. It also has nothing to do with your performance bars for each hero. You win, you lose rating. It's as simple as that.

However not every result affects you in the same way, and then some. Losing a game where you had the mmr advantage hurts more than losing a game where you shouldn't. The system does NOT force a 50% win ratio, that's simply the result of it trying to make fair games.

**But Palmar

No, that didn't go well.

In fact, the system won't care and will adjust your rating as if you played all heroes at that level.

Additionally if you always queue with a buddy, you might run into problems. However, the system does take into account the advantage of queueing as a party.

But yes

**But how can I be in the same bracket as these noobs??**

You are, you're mostly going to be queue-ing with people who are very close to you in mmr. This is a result of most people being close in mmr due to how the system will create a bell curve around the center of the rating.

So next time you want to flame some noob support who is ""taking your farm"" or a carry that ""can't last hit""

The caveat here is that parties with a large skill range fuck the system over and valve has not got any brilliant solution to that at the moment. But rest assured, the guy probably isn't a complete newbie and you're just wrong.

**Statistical bias

Just some quick napkin math. Let's assume that we win 50% of our games. That's close to correct for most of us non-pro mortals. Usually when you're winning

Let's also remember, that you LOSE 40% of your games and someone is worse than you!

I hope you see where I'm going with this. Because of the nature of the game, if you play 9/10 games well it's fine? right?

This is obviously very dumb. And it creates this huge bias that makes even fairly sane people start ranting about the ""noobs"" on their team.

Well, who are these terrible pubs? The truth is, they are us.

**Why you should play to win**

Here's the kicker. You can only control one variable, you will probably be somewhere close to 50%. If you want to improve you need to make sure you take every win you can take, and then you need to snatch out a few games you were going to lose.

If you play as well as you possibly can, do your best!

Focus on yourself, and your mmr will go up.

**How valve deals with strange parties**

Just know this, but valve has explained that instead they skew it higher towards the highest rated player, because they discovered that was more balanced. However this obviously puts a lot of pressure on the highest skilled player to play a hero that can take advantage of his skill level for the party to succeed.

I don't think there is a good solution to this at the moment.

**Other things

I'll leave this up to you

Knowing what we do about the mmr system, not ganking, feeding, stealing kills whatever your fancy is)

1. Support is much harder to play than other roles
2. Support is equally hard to play
3. Despite you thinking otherwise

I'm inclined to go with option number 3.

**How this makes your life better**

The first step is admittance. You are playing with people who are equally good as you. They may be having a good or a bad game, you cannot judge them. Admit you're not better than your team.

If someone is having a bad game, tp to save them, grant them freefarm. Remember that this guy is potentially a player of similar skill to yourself. It's never worth abandoning your team because ""they suck"". Chances are it's just that guy having a terrible game, so you can help pull him back by preventing him from digging an even deeper hole.

Accept that you can't win them all. Don't be mad about it, you can only fault yourself for being in a bracket where people do that in the fashion this guy just did. Take the wins you can, lose the others with grace. Always go down fighting.

At every point in the game, in fact, most of the time when solo queue-ing you cannot do much.

Even when you're improving, even if your team is ""stacked"" because you're improving and thus you have a higher than normal chance to win. Accept this, and move on. You did your best.

1373521606.0,1i2b0e,Only Korean citizens can play on the Korean server.,tagus,941,254,576,"**tl;dr: look at the title**

[I was afraid that this would happen.](http://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/1abrti/hey_rdota2_im_an_american_in_s_korea_and_even/)

I was told by some redditors that I got everyone worked up over nothing

Today in Korea (the 11th) is the day that Nexon said that they would release the information about the new Korean server.  And they did.  Not only did they release information

What is relevant to the non-Korean citizens of reddit (which is like more than 98% of reddit iirc from past admin blog posts) is that **unlike with League of Legends**

*The issue that I'm writing this post to call attention to (and hopefully change) is that more than 99% of everyone reading this (myself included) cannot make a Nexon ID because more than 99% of you are not Korean citizens.*

In the past post that I made on this topic, which is sometimes referred to as the Korean SSN) to play their games.  Nexon is one of them and they just so happen to be the biggest game company in Korea.

[Here is the proof that foreigners cannot make a Nexon ID and therefore cannot play in any Nexon games](http://imgur.com/Cml05JH, which is sometimes referred to as a Korean SSN).  It just tells you that foreigners are not allowed to use any of Nexon's services (i.e. games).

In the past, the authentication is where the problem arises.  I posted about this on Reddit and was promptly downvoted and insulted for daring to contradict this guy who *clearly* said the opposite of what I was saying (so clearly I must be wrong!).

If you're not authenticated (which they won't let anyone who isn't a Korean citizen do)

I have sent e-mails to Gaben from the day that it was announced that Nexon would be handling the Korean Dota2 servers, even though I posted it in Korean).  It was after all of those things that [I made this post on this subreddit about the topic.](http://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/1aa88y/when_connecting_to_aus_servers_my_korean_internet/)

---

Which brings us to today:

[Nexon updated their Dota 2 site](http://dota2.nexon.com/news/gmnews/view.aspx?n4ArticleSN=1#Scrol_01) with information about how their new Dota 2 client will work.

This particular section is the most important for those of us who are not Korean citizens:

&gt; 넥슨 회원 연동을 해야만 대한민국 서버에 접속할 수 있을까?

&gt;A : OK. 그 말이 정답이야. 도타 아이디에 넥슨 아이디 연동을 진행하고

&gt;회원 연동 후 도타 2 를 실행하면

What this says, you must link your Steam ID with your Nexon ID and then ~~both install a new DotA2 client all over again and login to DotA2 through the Nexon client~~ (if you put -nexon in the launch options it will load the korean version actually, but the issue remains the same about the nexon id).  Again, only Korean citizens can have a Nexon ID.

So

* Only Korean citizens can make a Nexon ID

* The Korean servers are only accessible through the separate Nexon Dota2 client ~~(that means you have to make a completely new install of Dota2 through Nexon's client)~~ (put -nexon in launch options to turn on 'korean mode'

* You can only access the Nexon Dota2 client by linking your Nexon ID to your Steam ID

* Only Korean citizens can make a Nexon ID

* Koreans can play with you

---

Now, your ping goes way up.  For those of us who live in Korea but are not Korean citizens (even the ones who have foreigner Registration Numbers), we don't have the luxury of being able to play with a less than 180ms ping unless we get lucky with the Great Firewall of China's Beijing servers (usually it's more than 400ms even though Seoul is a one hour flight from Beijing because of that Great Firewall).

Others will likely say something like ""well we can't do anything about it, and if Reddit can help force Microsoft to do a 180 on their XBox... It's unlikely that Reddit can't do anything about this matter.

Many others of you will explain Nexon's actions by saying that there's a law that prevents younger people (lower than 14 or 16 years old iirc) from playing games after 9pm.  This is true.  There is a law like that.  The reason why it doesn't explain Nexon's actions and is therefore ultimately wrong, not every company has this policy.  So it's not a governmental law that makes them prevent foreigners from playing.  Riot Korea and Pmang, for example, allow foreigners to play if they have the Registration Number.  Nexon just doesn't let foreigners *at all* participate.  Therefore it cannot be because of government policy or else all the companies that *do* let foreigners play (like Pmang and Riot-Korea) would be in big legal trouble.",Other,False,,1373547411.0,t3_1i2b0e

1375983474.0,1jyvgi,Thanks Valve.,Decentcy,832,163,109,"""@LiquidKorok : overheard some valve employees talking about how hearing the fans / their good attitudes when problems arise makes working hard worth it""
https://twitter.com/LiquidKorok/status/365358273995620352

Tweets such as these shows why Valve is such a beloved company. You can see it from the attention to detail from how they host The International to the game itself that Valve is as passionate as we are when it comes to how much love is poured into making DotA 2. I even hesitate to use the word ""fans"" as Gabe has said in the intro that they're as much of fans of DotA as we are. 

Valve's job isn't easy and in many ways I feel that their work on DotA 2 as a game in terms of it's actual development is very different from their projects such as Half Life, Valve has never been as transparent as a company before as they are now with Dota 2. You see the developers themselves directly respond towards the community at the dev.dota2.com website giving their stance on topics such as why they don't wish to reveal a player's ELO/MMR as well as why there isn't a concede option (whether you agree or disagree). They're also quick at taking suggestions from reddit such as spectator's being able to see a ward's range and integrating in the game's next patch cycle which goes to show that Valve is being keen on reddit posts as well. 

Finally we're already seeing a ton of memorable events thus far in this years International from a several awesome games to the hilarious laugh out loud all-stars match to end the first day with a bang and i'm sure there's more to come. The production level aside though

So I wanted to thank the hard working people at Valve for being the helm of DotA 2. We as the players might not always agree with Valve's decision as a company but I feel we have the same vision of making DotA 2 the best possible game out there with no signs of stopping until it does. I don't think any other game development company could have done an outstanding of a job as the guys as Valve has and we simply wouldn't have it any other way.

This is really upsetting because we're unable to play with many of our friends due to this issue. It is also worrying for the future of competitive Dota2 in Australia. 

Personally i hit 200ms on USWEST servers (which i play on) and 350-400ms on SEA servers. Other Australians have it flipped where they have 400ms on USWEST and 100-150ms on SEA.

**Full Text Tutorial**: http://www.dotacinema.com/forum/index.php?/topic/8013-vod-section-in-depth-tutorial-text/

Please let us know what you think! Keep in mind that we had to put a lot of features on the backburner in order to keep this launch date. I feel like one of the most popular feature  requests would be the ability to filter by Heroes. We are going to make this our top priority

Special thanks to our two main programming beasts

I always find people complaining about this or that in DOTA 2

One seemingly small thing I have especially noticed is the way that the skills for each hero really stand out, and it also just makes the game more entertaining as it feels like a very different experience depending on the hero you play.  Something as small as Kunkka's sword shining before a Tidebringer, or the noise Puck makes when he phase shifts.  The other games just really don't bring this quality to the playing field. The voice work of each hero, the small things they say to each other, all these things just give Dota 2 entertainment value that is hard to find elsewhere.  

Let's try to make a nice list of things like this so when new people (or even the veterans among us) come to this subreddit

Dota 2 only needs 2 CPU cores, and 250GB HDD should be enough for the average customer and can be easily upgraded.

There you go

EDIT: Apparently some reviews classify the previous PSU I posted as a ticking time bomb. Found a even better unit. $20 MIR and $15 promo code? Yes

EDIT2: This is getting a lot more response than i expected. I listened to your advice and got rid of the DVD writer.

As for the people saying that this is not upgradable - it doesn't matter. This is for people who dont know much about computers and just want to play Dota 2.

(Also you can get a used i5 2400 and something like 7870XT and play any game you want on 1080p

Edit: aight as he promised the tags are undone

&gt; Hey guys, is how our database pulls stories into the hub pages we have on the website: http://www.pcgamer.com/game/dota-2

&gt; The stories in question were written by a new contributor; I'm sorry if it was offensive to see a headline for a competing game in the same genre in the Dota 2 news feed. Sometimes we might start off writing a story with a broader scope--comparing LoL's policies to Dota 2's, so hopefully you can take that as a sign that we're not some gang of scheming, Texan Illuminati pageview barons.

&gt; Bottom line: it's not part of our strategy to put non-relevant content in front of y'all. I've removed the tag from these stories; I'm unsure if the Steam news feed dynamically updates

&gt; Feel free to reach out to me if you want to talk more about this. We like cats and chocolate milk and maybe we can be friends.

I love all games! I'm also certain I'm not alone.

I feel a main idea behind this is the sheer intimidation effect of learning a new game. A lot of people see SC2 and feel it is way to complicated and daunting to try to jump into. For me personally that's why I haven't really been able to get into dota2! But I want to give the game the respect it deserves


I propose a ""coaching exchange"" idea where each person would both give and receive coaching in their respective games. I offered free coaching from myself to r/leagueoflegends in exchange for being able to jump into their game to play with them. The response I received was staggering.

I can't possibly coach them all so thankfully some of my friends from r/starcraft offered similar deals.

I wish to do this with dota 2 as well.

So here I am. If you guys are open to it

Can someone teach me the ropes? :D

1354977191.0,14hy72,Math!,BigBadPenismonster,781,161,167,"Hello r/dota2!

As a very new player that is too anxious to actually play the game I've decided to calculate a few answers to some questions I had.
Most of those are very basic and probably well known


**Average jungle gold** (no skeletons)

small camp - 81.33

medium camp - 102.6

large camp - 124

ancients - 264.33

total jungle - 81.33 + 2×102.6 + 2×124 = 534.53 gold per minute

On average there are 14.13 creeps in a jungle

30×14.13 = 423.9



**DPS increase due to lower BAT (Base Attack Time)**: 170/BAT-1

For example AM's dps is increased by 17%

This makes both crits and minus armor ~~more effective~~ work well on heroes with low BAT, so a 142% increase in his raw DPS ~ damage × (attackspeed+100) )

Note that a lower BAT does in fact not make getting attack speed more effective than damage.



**Comparison of armor with HP in terms of Effective HP (EHP)**

worth of 1 HP in armor = armor+16.7 / HP

worth of 1 armor in HP = HP / armor+16.7

It scales linearly, so I didn't bother to write it down.


So for example AC (Assault Cuirass) gives the same amount of (physical) EHP as heart when

15 = 1060 × a+16.7 / h

http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=17702%2F15%2B%28212+a%29%2F3+for+a+%3D+-5+to+20

At the line both are the same


Skaadi gives the same amount of EHP as a heart when

(h+675)×(1+0.06×(a+25/7)) = (h+1060)×(1+0.06×a)

http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=plot+-16825%2F1617%2B%285+h%29%2F539+for+h%3D500+to+3000

Skaadi is better for physical EHP below the line, Skaadi might actually be better for tanking up than a Heart. (I must admit I was a little surprised by that, since no one ever buys Skaadi, despite it giving a bit more DPS than a heart on most strength heroes and a lot more on agi heroes.)


For Satanic it looks as follows (ignoring the EHP gain due to lifesteal): (h+475)×(1+0.06×(a+5)) = (h+1060)×(1+0.06×a)

http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=plot+-1475%2F117%2Bh%2F117+for+h%3D+500+to+3000

I'd say this makes Satanic better than Heart in almost all cases
as a carry when you have any chance of winning teamfights at all
But maybe I'm missing something, Alchemist, Slardar, SK, Lifestealer, Doom or Lycan?

It should also be noted that armor gets better if you have lifesteal.

The most effective HP/armor combinations are still hard to calculate
while pure HP is also obviously worth more because of magical damage.

But assuming 1 armor = 25 hp in terms of gold

25 × a+16.7 / h = 1

4 × h / 100 = a + 17  -  multiply your HP after receiving all the magic damage you expect with 4 and subtract the first few digits of that by 17



**EHP gain due to damage reduction or evasion**: 1/(1-dr) - 1

Keep in mind that this percentage is based on your EHP
If you have both evasion and damagereduction from some ability they obviously stack multiplicatively
for example a Void tethered to a Wisp has his EHP increased by 1/0.75 × 1/0.8 - 1 = 66%

This also works with damage increase (~ negative damagereduction)

Since lifesteal does grant you essentially a damagereduction of (lifesteal × your DPS / enemy DPS) while attacking
This also means that lifesteal gets increasingly effective
Note that reducing incoming damage therefore gets better with lifesteal.

A bit off topic, making me wonder why support Rubicks (in pro games)
max Telekinesis before Null Field
that significant anymore
it would be higher than his winrate when maxing Telekinesis over NF.



**DPS increase of attack speed vs damage**

DPS increase of one extra AS = dmg/BAT

DPS increase of one extra dmg = (100+AS)/BAT

relative effectiveness of one AS compared to one dmg  =  dmg / (100+as)

and of one dmg compared to one AS = (100+as) / dmg

Also scales linearly. This is why AS is so important on tiny

Another example, so the DPS increase of a Hand of Midas and a Battlefury would be the same (2.1667*30=65).

So assuming AS is gold wise worth the same as dmg

This also means that for roughly comparing different item's DPS potential



**DPS increase due to armor reduction**

a = armor

if the final armor is above zero

(1+0.06×a) / (1+0.06×(a-b)) - 1

if the final armor is below zero (but above the minimum of armor):

(1+0.06×a) × (2-.94^(b-a)) - 1

It stacks multiplicatively with crit



**Damage block compared to armor**

d = enemy damage, x = extra armor

to compare the worth of extra armor with damage block:

d = b×(3a+3x+50)/3x

x = (3a+50)×b/(3(d-b))

This means that damage block is more effective if your enemy's damage is low and your armor (or other damagereduction sources) is high (since it essentially adds a multiplicatively stacking damage reduction of block/damage).

For example, you can use the following graph:

http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=28*%283*a%2B30%2B50%29%2F30+for+a%3D0+to+20

(It shows when both are equal in EHP gain
in the area below the graph the 28 damageblock is more effective

Personally I think this makes Vanguard a terrible item and I can honestly not see a situation where it is superior to an Armlet (which gives more HP, or even a Vitality Booster + Stout + HoIW (Helm of Iron Will) (which can be turned into a Heart and Satanic or Armlet eventually, while a Vanguard is almost worthless lategame).
I don't have enough experience to say how much a better a RoH is than a HoIW for laning

For the latter combination the graph looks as follows:

http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=plot+244%2F3%2B%2816+a%29%2F5+for+a+%3D+0+to+20



**DPS increase of MKB (Monkey King Bar) truestrike with m = misschance**: 1 / (1-m) - 1

for m = 0.25: 33%

for m = 0.35: 53.8%

This means if you have only a 25% chance to miss
Realistically this point can't be reached though



**DPS increase of Daedalus with another crit** (all skills maxed out)

PA: 0.15×4.5+0.25×0.85×2.7+0.85×0.75 = 1.886

Juggernaut: 0.25×2.7+0.35×0.75×2+0.75×0.65 = 1.6875

SK: 0.15×2.75+0.25×0.85×2.7+0.75×0.85 = 1.628

CK: 0.1×3+0.9×0.25×2.7+0.9×0.75 = 1.5825		1.5825/1.2  = 1.32

Second Daedalus: (1-0.75^2 )×1.7 + 1 = 1.74375		1.744/1.425 = 1.224


So if true strike isn't an issue, assuming the bash damage is physical and gets amplified by crits, which should be true for ranged heroes):

(100+a)×(d+81)×1.224 = (115+a)×(123+d)

http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=%28321720%2B1815+a%29%2F%28560%2B17+a%29+from+a%3D0+to+a%3D300

In the area above the graph a second Daedalus is more effective

For PA the equation for getting a Daedalus above MKB is: (assuming the bash is in fact magical and does not get amplified by crits

(100+a)×(d+81)×1.886 = (115+a)×(88+d)×1.525+(115+a)×35

http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=%2818+%28232300%2B913+a%29%29%2F%2813225%2B361+a%29+from+a%3D0+to+a%3D300

Note that MKB gets a bit better if the enemy has very high armor (because of the magic damage)
A Daedalus also makes PA more stable

(This is done without PRD (Pseudo Random Distribution)


**Crystal Maiden's Freezing field average DPS**

Inside a 685-215 = 470 radius you'll get hit by an average of (215/685)^2 ×10 = 0.99 explosion per second

Outside that radius the chance of getting hit decreases until it is zero at 685+215 = 900

I'm not really in the mood for integration right now
but if someone wants to know it I might do it. (It's really easy



**Ogre Magi's Fireblast average damage depending on Multicast level**

1: 275×(1+0.25) = 343.75

2: 275×(1+0.2+0.2×2) = 440

3: 275×(1+0.25+0.125×2+0.125×3) = 515.625

Another thing I often see is people being ganked and complaining that there are no wards. Wards cost ~150 gold for 2 wards, buy the wards. They going to save you AND your allies gold, might even spot low-hp enemy hero, and get a kill. When I queue with friends that are new to Dota, it is very visible, and often, despite being ganked over and over again they refuse to buy wards because ""thats not their job"".


Another example of this, 200 gold sentry will solve this problem, and most probably will payoff with the next kill. Also, smokes counter wards, don't forget about that, they are even cheaper than sentries! 
This might be a little basic for some players

In HoN after a couple of years, I tried LoL a couple of times, and to me, it is really just a casual version with features affecting balance and I really didnt like that. I am more of a play-to-win than a play-for-fun guy. It's probably since I've been playing a lot of soccer and basketball and other team related IRL sports.

Last summer just before the international, which heroes I hated and which I loved to play and so on, and I only remember some of the heroes and had learnt new ones, thanks to HoN.

Things that I believe need to be improved:

* Tournament Tab - How many tournaments happen in dota on a monthly basis, BTS, proDOTA tournaments. I can't find those on your website. I have no idea who's in those tournaments and what their schedule is.
* Vods - unorganized as hell. I would prefer to actually get rid of the vods tab and incorporate it into the tournaments tab
* Livestreams - Separate out casting and playing - I have no idea whether draskyll is casting a game or streaming
* Schedule/Event View - Upcoming Broadcasts is good
* News section - this is pretty good. The 'Main' news (currently ProDOTA) needs to be desperately improved. An Information Tab should be the first one. Teams/Groups should be incorporated into a Brackets Tab. Vods - needs vods of the tournament specifically
* Forums - I don't use the forums so I won't comment. 
* Wiki - You should link to the dota2 wiki or try to create your own. This is essential for viewing old information or even current information. Team Liquid does this amazingly, I wouldn't look for it. This is the same with Dota2. I would say I am somewhere between a casual and hardcore viewer. If I miss a tournament it doesn't bother me, but with the current state of the website, I'm not going to bother trying to find vods for a specific tournament, unless it's recommended on Reddit because it takes 5-10 minutes just to FIND the vods.
* Layout - The website does not utilize my widescreen monitor at all. 50% of my screen is unused. This makes it ugly and harder to read.

Personally I've gone through the trenches of matchmaking from 2 years ago to playing in very high now, or immersion in the game for that matter. I have been perfectly content with the WEEKLY patch updates which not only listen and respond to the community (Allowing new players to watch matches before tutorials and also spectator ward vision in this last patch alone) but also feel like quality work is getting done. On top of all this they are continually preparing for the biggest event in esports history and are handling it fantastically with the compendiums and everything that goes along with them.

If you just type ""status"" in the console it will give you the IP address of the current game you're connected to along with a whole bunch of information about the clients connected to it along with their ping

Once you've got the ip just tell the disconnected user to type ""connect &lt;IP address&gt;"" in the console and he/she will be able to rejoin the game.

**EDIT 2:** I'm getting a lot of messages in my inbox saying this was a stupid thread and a blatant karma-whoring attempt, I was afraid I might be breaking the subreddit rules by not being relevant -- hence why I posted this. As for the karma-whoring, this is a self-post on a throwaway account for that very reason. Sorry for making this more difficult than it had to be. I'll start working on it.
