Burn Notice has been shooting in the condemned Coconut Grove Convention center for 6 years


The City of Coconut Grove thinks that Burn Notice is holding back the city from it's true potential and think that space would better be used as a park which ""would draw tourists"" and improve Coconut Grove. 

So the plan of the City of Miami commissioners is to NOT RENEW the lease for Burn Notice

For those not familiar with the area

Let me start off by saying I live in Miami

Burn notice uses the city of Miami former (old) convention center as it's main stage. Most of the interior shots are filmed there, the city of Miami is corrupt, and ignorant. They don't get anything done done that is productive, and their film commissioner is an absolute imbecile.

The decision has been made to kick burn notice out of the convention center

What this means for the show: Although burn notice has maybe one or two more seasons left

Currently I don't know (or forgot) why the decision was made

It was great getting some insight into why Michael does what he does - what motivates him. Especially hearing him say it in his own words (though Anson may have forced him to admit it). I think Anson's reason for coming along and ""asking questions"" was not because he didn't know the answers - after all

Loved the return of Beatriz (Ilza Rosario) from ""The Fall of Sam Axe""! Glad to see she's grown up into a fine (if risk-taking) young woman. Also liked Mark Ivanir's and Simon Kassianides' characters (Ivan the Russian handler and George Anders

The ""job"" in the Caymans wasn't so interesting this week

Anson's confrontation with Michael about his father was... tense. I was expecting Mike to punch him (I'm hoping he'll get the chance eventually

Michael gets cleared of Max's murder by Tavian quite early on

Larry's reappearance seemed a bit... I dunno, because he didn't seem like he'd be the true villain behind everything (though he does have a penchant for messing with Michael's life). Another reason I suspected Anson was the true villain. Quite a revelation that Michael covered up a murder by Larry as part of the job. Guess they weren't all that different after all – at least at one point. (The pause before he said ""I didn't do anything in Chechnya"" said volumes.)

I suspected Anson a tiny bit right from the start

For all the trigger-happiness Fiona's shown so far

You can see the stuff Anson says – particularly his mentioning that Mike's mom talked to him (and what she said about his dad) – is really getting to Michael. I'm surprised he hasn't punched Anson yet. A good bit of exposition and history tied up by Anson's dialogue though: why Michael was burned

(...I just realized that Anson *knew* Michael would let him escape

I can't wait for November and the rest of the season. Anson's in for an ass-kicking come the true season finale. (Hopefully Michael comes clean to her about Anson early in the season. He needs to stop having such trust issues. Though Anson might be listening in or something.)

James Frain! I recognized him from the short-lived NBC show ""The Cape"" (which I personally enjoyed). He did a great job playing the ""bad guy pretending he's a good guy"" this episode (and he's great at looking terrified and yelling at people :P).

Sam seemed hungry this episode. Donuts, despite knowing their importance. ""Weren't expecting that, were ya?"" Heh, most adults don't. (Even funnier when he tried it again.)

Another ""client switcheroo"" this time around... I loved seeing Jesse's expression when he figured out that they were going to help Dan by getting James to trust them with security.

It was exciting seeing him try to figure out how to escape after he'd been seen on the cameras... Quite a risky move

The ending with Sadie being in the shadows as James said she was ""no catch"" reminded me of the end of Ocean's Eleven.

Lucien's interrogation was pretty uneventful, obviously fake (as we know Michael's not that kind of person). Now another lead to pursue... I wish we actually got some answers, or at least a hint or two, instead of another wild goose chase.

Do I think Michael is going to be able to ultimately kill Tom Card or meet his father? In a way yes, in a way no.

The CIA is full of them. Who's to say that Anson Fullerton was only posing as a DIA psychologist when he was a Operative himself???
