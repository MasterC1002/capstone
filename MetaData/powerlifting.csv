With LiftWhat, then bookmark that page so you can reference quickly from your phone in the gym.

Figured I'd post here first as I see you getting the most benefit from it.

Feel free to let me know if you find bugs, but the fixes should come pretty quickly.

EDIT:

Thanks everyone for all the great feedback and kind words! You are awesome. Action items for the next release tomorrow night:

* Free text inputs instead of dropdowns
* Option for rounding the weight numbers (e.g.
* Adding in Smolov Jr.

The judging was fair and accurate for all lifters

Now, bench or deads, someone was always willing to help out! I needed a depth caller when I was there and Shane Sweatt (Laura Phelps' husband) told me he would do it and didnt let me down. Throughout the meet, seasoned vets were talking and joking with everyone, and it seemed like everyone was having a great time! I BS'd with Jason Coker and Luke Edwards for a while and hearing these guys talk and give guys crap and also take jokes showed these are just every day guys with extraordinary talent ad work ethic. Jimmie Pacifico was another that made an impression on me. Good to see such a good head on a guy so young (i mean he is my age but he could be a lot cockier than he is). I met a guy in squat warmups and the rest ofthe meet we were jacking each other up and shoving nose tork in each others faces and helping each other along. Everyone there really wanted everyone else to succeed and that will leave a lasting impression on me. Powerlifting really is the best sport on the planet.

1330888255.0,qhfmq,My Arnold Raw Challenge Report,jokerbot,24,2,11,"I'm pretty excited about this past weekend because it was my first international meet so I thought I'd share.

I entered the 93kg (205lbs) class in the Open and Junior divisions.

**Weigh in**

84.8kg (187lbs)

I wanted to be on the light end to have a good shot at winning best lifter but didn't expect to be this light.  I don't feel like I lost any strength dieting because I just stopped being a fatass.

**Squat**

230kg (507lbs)   240kg (529lbs)   247.5kg (545lbs)

My first time going 3/3 in squat in 6yrs of competing!  To make it even better both the 240 and 247.5 were PRs over my old best of 237.5.  
One odd thing was my shoes.  I have been squatting and deadlifting in Vivo Barefoot shoes (similar concept to Vibram FiveFingers) for about 3yrs but was told after my first attempt to find ""indoor sport shoes"".  Luckily I had some friends with Chucks.  That was a little annoying but I don't think it hurt my performance.

**Bench Press**

175kg (385lbs)   180kg (396lbs)   ~~185kg (407lbs)~~

Maybe the weight loss did have an effect.  About 4 weeks out I did 405lbs for 5 paused singles but I weighed 200lbs then.  Nevertheless I hit a 5kg meet PR.  Here's a [video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bsv0XGmOZaw) of the 180kg.

**Deadlift**

265kg (584lbs)   ~~285kg (628lbs)   285kg (628lbs)~~

The 285kg felt easier than 265kg until the last few inches.  I just couldn't lock it out.  That really sucked for two reasons.  If I pulled that I would have been best lifter (lightweight and junior) and I hate regressing.  Missing it at the Arnold means my deadlift and total went down.

**Results**

My total was 692.5kg (1526lbs)

Friday and Saturday morning I was just bummed about the deadlift.  Now that I've had a few days to watch the other lifters and relax I'd say that miss is more motivating for next year than bothersome.  Also,False,,t5_2s4tp,False,,,t3_qhfmq

1366605189.0,1cug1v,Recipes From Powerlifters,mollyorourke,19,4,24,"Eating food is a really important part of powerlifting. Here are a few things powerlifters expect from their food:


* Nutritious in the sense that it fuels workouts (ENERGY)

* Nutritious in the sense that it assists recovery (RECOVERY)

* Not so expensive that you can't eat it consistently (EXPENSE)

* Tasty enough that you can eat it consistently (TASTE)

* Good trade-off between how much time it takes to prepare and the volume of food you get from the preparation (EASE)


Would you please share some of your favorite recipes and rank them from 0 - 10 according to the criteria above? I'll start:


""Soylent Green"" Shake:

* 2 cups raw oats

* 1 banana

* 1 tablespoon coconut oil

* 1 tablespoon walnut oil

* 1 tablespoon olive oil

* 1.5 cups spinach

* 3 cooked egg whites (You can microwave these.)

* 2 tablespoons sunflower butter

* 1/4 cup plain whole fat yogurt

* 4 cups whole milk


Take all items and blend them in a blender. I think this is about 1500 calories.


Here is my ranking for this recipe:

ENERGY: 7 (It contains lots of oats and fats. It can keep you from getting hungry for awhile.)

RECOVERY: 5 (It has a medium amount of protein.)

EXPENSE: 4 (The oils are expensive.)

TASTE: 8 (This shake is actually pretty tasty.)

I wasn't sure why he would want me to open with 100# LESS than my best gym lift (technically 425 was my best gym lift, but my foot came up so I don't count it).  He explained the following:

""Gym lifting is not meet lifting.  In the gym you can get away with slop

The [Starting Strength Wiki](http://www.reddit.com/r/powerlifting/comments/dmand/rippetoes_starting_strength_wiki/) is an awesome resource detailing the simple, book, and DVD created by Coach Mark Rippetoe. There is also a [Starting Strength Forum](http://startingstrength.com/resources/forum/forum.php) run by the Coach, and a preconfigured [Starting Strength Withfit Tracker](http://www.withfit.com/programs/Original+Starting+Strength). People generally use the SS program until they are able to squat almost twice their bodyweight, and then they move on to other routines like the ones listed below.

From Wikipedia: *Simmons has worked with twenty-five World and National Champion powerlifters, Green Bay Packers, New England Patriots, Seattle Seahawks and numerous college football teams.*

*Simmons is the owner and trainer of the legendary Westside Barbell, based loosely on the conjugate parallel system advocated by various strength coaches in the former Soviet Union.*

*The training week in the Westside Barbell system typically consists of four sessions per week. Two of these sessions focus on upper body work, typically using box squats with a fast speed and lighter loads than the max effort day.*

**Video**

[Link.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zplZe0MzXtQ)  I know the angle isn't great and the first squat and half of the second squat are missing.  My dad was doing the filming and he isn't accustomed to using smartphones.

**Goals**
As usual, set individual lift PRs. Third, win.  Fourth, go for records. I almost achieved them all.  You can see the results above.  In addition to that, I set some records.  Squat: PR at this bodyweight, which increased my PA state and American junior records.  Bench: PR for any bodyweight and increased my state record.  Total: PR for this bodyweight, which increased my state and American junior records.

**Making Weight**

I've been successfully lowering my offseason weight for about a year.  I was down to 187lbs six weeks out and 185lbs three weeks out.  I thought being that close would have made for an easy cut.  I was very wrong.  I ended up not eating or drinking anything for about 33 hours.  Given that I set a PR total

**Squat**

The first attempt got three white lights.  It was a little bit slow for an opener but felt easy enough to stick to my planned 10kg jump.  The second attempt was very slow out of the hole but fast on the top half.  I decided to be conservative and only go up 5kg rather than my planned 10kg jump.  I missed the third.  Part of the problem was that I got one red light for depth on the second attempt.  If I was going to miss a lift I wanted it to be because of strength, but my quads quit on me before I got too far up.

**Bench Press**

I was nervous about my bench throughout training.  It was inconsistent and I was working around pain from a partially torn pec.  None of that mattered at the meet.  Everything was perfect and I was pain-free.  I got three white lights on every attempt.  Part of what made this so successful was my game plan.  I realized that I never went 3/3 benching so I dropped my opener to 165kg then went to a weight I had done within one week of the meet.  I had no say in the third attempt.  I told my handler to make the call because I tend to be too aggressive.

**Deadlift**

This makes two years in a row where I fell apart on the deadlift at the Arnold.  I've done about 20 meets over 8 years and have always been able to deadlift more in the meet than in training except at the Arnold.  Last year I thought the problem was a last minute change to my training.  This year I haven't thought of a good explanation yet.  Maybe that means I'm not as strong as I thought?  I opened heavier than ever with 280kg, 295kg was the right call.  Anything less wouldn't have changed my placing in my weight class or for the payout.  Also, I was trying to beat the world record holder in the deadlift.  Had I gone for anything lighter I would have needed him to miss a lift.  I don't think hoping for a record holder to miss at his best lift is a good strategy (for the record, he did go 3/3 and increase the record to 310.5kg).

**Thoughts**

I'll start with the bad so I can end on a positive note (despite my complaints I am happy with the results). I’m starting to get frustrated that I can’t peak all three lifts at the same time.  It’s been about 2.5 years since I hit a PR in every lift at the 2010 American Open.  Going 6/9 is frustrating too.  I should be more consistent in my 8th year of competing.

I am a new Moderator for this sub and my first order of business is setting up a Virtual Powerlifting Competition. This will allow users to compete against each other virtually and provide motivation to continue training.

How this works:
I will maintain a Google Spreadsheet which has username and weight class. It will not be split into age class. Lifters will upload a video of their max and if it's deemed a good lift

To prove yourself

My first prototype spreadsheet for this competition can be found here: [Virtual Competition Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AmXLUXLcK55HdGROTlY0Y09iN1MzMzhpaGtoWkttSlE&amp;hl=en_US)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Virtual Powerlifting Competition (Beta rules)

Background: This is the official Reddit Virtual Powerlifting Competition. It allows Redditors to compete against each other in a Leader Board style competition which also has a specific ending date. 

How do I join:
To join the competition you need to comment or PM me your user-name and weight-class. Although I trust Redditors would not lie about your weight class

Rules: We are following the 100% Raw Powerlifting Federation rule book. This goes for equipment, and so on.
http://www.rawpowerlifting.com/pdf/GeneralRules.pdf

Verification:
We are trying to keep the competition clean. We are trying to find the least tedious method of verifying weight class and under-names. Currently this is the method:

* You can weight in the day prior or the day of your max attempts. To prove your weight you must video tape or take a picture of yourself on a scale and showing a newspaper with your user-name written on it and which shows the date.

* Prior to the lifting video you must again show a newspaper or method of determine the date with your user name written on the paper. All three (Squat

* Your lifting video will be reviewed by myself and others to act as the judge. If the lift is deemed good than we will update the spreadsheet.

This is just for fun
If you have another other good ideas for the verification process or the competition in general

If you would like to be part of the competition

Edit: I believe I have added all the names so far

I requested yesterday and today off from work so I could get enough sleep but my boss scheduled me to work until 11pm so I only got about 4 hours of sleep before having to head north. Also had a fever and sore throat. But hey

The APA has several fat kid weight classes: 308

Training leading up to the meet had been okay. I did well in a full power meet 5 weeks ago

I weighed in at 342.25. The state record for the APA raw bench is 410 and the deadlift was 610. The American record in this category is 700.

Bench
Right before my attempt on the bench
Attempt 1: 350 - EZ PZ
Attempt 2: 375 - Also PZ. By this time
Attempt 3: 400 - missed it about 6"" off my chest. Soon as it hit my chest it felt like a million pounds.

During the intermission, and nibble on the pizza that they provided but it wasn't sitting well. I started warming up on the deadlifts really early in the hopes that it would kickstart my CNS into waking the fuck up. With things about as good as they were going to get, I hit the platform.

Deadlift
Attempt 1: 640 - good lift - I lowered my opener to 640 from 660 just to get something decent on the board. This was a state record.
Attempt 2: 670 - good lift - Felt like a grinder off the floor but the top end was easy enough. State record.
Attempt 3: 705 - good lift - I can't remember ever completing a deadlift that started this slowly. I busted capillaries all over my shoulders and face

I missed winning best lifter by something like 1.57 points. Would have won it if I kept my bw in the low 330's or made that 400lb bench

The problem came one night about 2 weeks ago when I was sitting in my recliner and couldn't make a fist with my right hand. My shoulder also ached. The next morning I work up and my right arm (starting at my shoulder blade) was bright reddish purple and my arm was rock hard and full of veins. 

Fast forward 6 days in the hospital. It turned out that I had 2 blood clots (deep vein thrombosis) DUE TO FRONT SQUATS AND BACK SQUATS. This clot extended from my bicep to my neck. 

This was such a freak thing for someone with no infections, healthy eating, non smoking, and to to have it in my shoulder. Doctors were completely baffled. 

Pressure from the weights across my shoulders and chest apparently stressed veins enough to begin clotting. 

I'm OK now but depressed as hell. The stay in the hospital was difficult mentally (3 days of catheterizing the clot to no avail

Be careful out there. I had no symptoms of this. Had I dismissed this asymmetry to a muscle tear or something

[Edit/update] 
I have met with a series of doctors and a vascular surgeon. I don't have any markers or clotting condition. I just have a narrow opening between my collar bone and my top rib. Padge-schroetter Disease is the condition (aka Thoracic outlet Syndrome). 

It can be found in athletes who bear weight and stress on their shoulders. It is commonly found on the dominant arm. Hockey players, and pitchers can develop this condition if their anatomy is similar to mine. 

Be careful out there. 

[Update2]

I found out today that there has been a link established between energy drinks and clots. I don't drink energy drinks and my form for squats was spot on. It's Thoracic Outlet Syndrome until proven otherwise. ",,t5_2s4tp,1363043304.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/powerlifting/comments/163edv/an_unexpected_sports_injury/

##Pre-Meet    
I decided to do this meet about 2 months before the meet. I had been running Wendler 5/3/1 for about 4 months at that point. I haven't done a meet in about 6 years, but I decided to just go for it. I bought my bench shirt about a month out, which turned out to be a huge mistake. The squat suit I used was one I had laying around from high school. I used an Inzer lever belt and some Inzer Iron Wrap Z knee wraps. I had already been cutting for about a month when I decided to do the meet, and was about 235 pounds at that point. A week before the meet I was sitting at 229 and had to cut pretty hard to make weight. The day of the meet I didn't eat or drink anything, and ended up making weight by .1 lbs. I weighed in at 220.1. I'm pretty sure cutting that much hurt me quite a bit, and looking forward I will try to stay as close to competition weight as possible. 

##Meet Day    
This was my first experience with the NASA federation, but everyone was really nice. I competed in the 220 lb Equipped Junior Division, and was the only competitor in my class.  
**Squat**    
I set my opening lift super low because I was nervous and just wanted to be sure I could do it with no stress. The only warmup I got was 225x5 because I waited too long and the flight moved faster than I was expecting, so I went to 540 which would have been an all time PR for me. I got the lift, but I got called up just a tad early by my brother. It was definitely a doable weight, and I should have gone lower and gotten it.  

**Bench**    
Like I said, so I was hoping to beat this one as well. 320 went up as planned, so I went to what I knew I could do in my shirt fairly easy, 408 lbs. I got the weight, but my butt came off the bench so I was red lighted. I stayed with the same weight for my 3rd attempt, and I focused on slamming my butt into the bench throughout the lift. I was pretty confident that I got it, but got 2 reds for my butt coming off again. This is the lift I was most disappointed with, I had to kind of shake things off and get ready for deadlift.  

**Deadlift**    
Deadlift is by far my most comfortable lift, and decided to break the record of 567 lbs for my second attempt of 573. It was a bit of a struggle, but I was still feeling pretty strong. Attempted 601 for my 3rd but just couldn't finish the lockout. I had gotten 600 in the gym about a month prior to the meet, but I weighed between 230 and 235 at that time, so the cutting probably hurt me here.  

##Post-Meet    
I was pretty mad at myself overall with this meet. I did set some meet PR's, but I feel like I could have set all 4. I will definitely try to stick to my competition weight for the next meet, seeing as cutting probably affected me quite a bit. I also need much more practice in my bench shirt. All in all, I'm glad that I went but it just made me want to do so much better.  

If anyone knows of any meets coming near North Texas soon

Thanks for reading, or questions!

Apparently it looked easy, slowwwwwwly let it down, sinking the bar into my chest, holding my breath, feeling pressure throughout my body like I've never felt before and for a brief moment time almost stood still.

* Bar is too far out in front

I currently bench 305(about 4 years)

Should I be lifting to the point where it makes me mildy sore, or just not sore?

My current split is: 

Sunday: squat 3 sets of 5 at 80% and throw in some biceps and calves

Tues: bench 3-4 sets of 5 at 80%

Thurs: dead 3x5 at 80%

If you have any suggestions to the lift programming that is fine but this simplistic nature has done me well. This type of heavy lifting consistently gets me what I would say is a 6 out of 10 on my soreness index. 10 being: I just lifted for the first time and feel like I am dying.

Second is about records - I recently joined USAPL, (or ever @75kg, because I'm not 5') but being 100lbs from any record is exciting regardless. SO. What is going on with the huge differences between these records? I want to be setting good goals for myself, and I can't figure out what lifts I should be aspiring to if I'm competing raw/un-juiced. Obviously these goals are ridiculous as I've only been lifting for a couple years, but still. Let a guy dream. Are some feds better about testing than others?

I am wondering if my numbers justify my current weight/body fat percentage. I currently weigh 190 lb and estimate that I am around 22% body fat (I'd have to take a measurement to be absolutely sure). My SL 5x5 routine has been going for about 7 months now and my numbers don't seem that high for my weight/body composition. Squat is petering out at around 280 lb, and deadlift has been petering out around 360 lb.

My question is: Is there room to lose some body fat while retaining these numbers? I feel like a powerlifter with less body fat and body weight can lift just as much as I am right now (maybe I'm wrong in this regard).

I know that changing up my volume can help increase the numbers,,False,,t5_2s4tp,1361804630.0,,True

Here's him deadlifting:

Notice how high the belt is on his body? Is that generally how powerlifters roll

So putting one and two together

Comments? 

One additional question:

KK undoubtedly inspires many because of his ""strong AND lean-ish"" physique (in contrast to ""strong but fat""). I know he was a bodybuilder before he was a powerlifter, is KK's physique generally anomalous in the sport of powerlifting? If so, is it mostly anomalous due to a bias inherent in members of powerlifting, e.g. ""Man, fuck conditioning and dieting, I just wanna be strong!""? Or is it mostly anomalous due to difficulties inherent in the sport itself, e.g. ""Man, trying to stay lean AND getting strong is feasible

I'm at a point now where I want to compete again when my lifts are where I want them but am unsure if it would be powerlifting, and squat is probably closer) switch back to my ""strongest potential"" forms, do a mixture of both (sumo dl and olympic squat or conv dl with wide squat) or simply alternate each form and decide which to use when closing in on a potential competition( not ideal for running Sheiko or my own thoughts on conjugate vs competition lift focus)?

Gender: Male

Height: 5'8

Meet: Richmond Open at Atlee High School, its about 15 minutes away. 

Experience: I've been powerlifting for 7 years, squatting/deadlifting a plate, gained about 30 pounds my first year, and 5 pounds a year thereafter til my current weight. I've played soccer the entire time, ranging from 5-6 times a week at the division 3 college level play, to right now I play once a week in a mens high-level rec league. Smoked from 19-21, quit three years ago.

Weight: Walk at 170, and I really don't want to get bigger than I am now anyway because I love to play soccer and any more weight wouldn't play at the competitive level I do now. The last month, I usually go to bed at ~170, and wake up at ~166, so Ill be doing no sodium Thursday Friday, and no liquids whatsoever after 5PM friday. Ill drink 1+ gallon a day water Monady - Thursday. It's not the biggest deal if I don't make weight, but its something I'd like to do.

Occupation: Software Developer

GOALS: My first rep is going to be fairly comfortable, with 5 minutes between each rep. I think I'm fairly comfortable with them. 

My second attempt will be my current PR for all of the lifts, even if I don't make weight.

My third attempt will be a new PR for all three lifts. I've altered it slightly, than 15 pounds less at 50%. I would be absolutely estatic if I hit 9/9, especially if I make weight.

FOOD ON DAY OF EVENT: As soon as weight ins are over, ill get some coffee in me, and I am bringing about two pounds of brown rice, and some of my home made pulled pork. Ill munch on this all day, a few bites every hour or so, but never enough to get super full. I'm also bringing 4-5 bottles of my homemade pre-workout drink, which is basically 5 hour energy(caffiene + vitamin b6) and creatine, but Im planning on having 3


Squat: Openner: 365. I'm pretty comfortable with this, and gotten singles on it about 10 more times. Ive never failed with it, but theres been once or twice where I may have just hit parallel, as opposed to going a few inches below.

Second Attempt: 405 is my max ever

Third Attempt: This is where things get tricky. This totally depends on how good 405 feels. If 405 feels great, but I get it, I might go for 420 or 415. If I dont make weight, the state record at 181 is 445, so I would attempt to tie it, and I would break it due to my(assumed) lower body weight. 

BENCH: Openner: 220(100kg) - This is my weakest lift. Ive improved tremendously in form + weight the last few months

Second: 235 - I hit 235 back in February. I stalled at lockout, but not enough to justify going for more. If I had an option between 233 and 237, Id go 233.

Third - Totally depends on the 235. If it goes up, Id go low 240s. I think this lift is the one where Im going to improve the most the next few months, but Im not quite there yet.

Deadlift: Openner: 455 - I changed from conventional to sumo in November or so

Second: I might be exhausted at this point. Last week, Im going for 495/501. If I feel like crap, I might just go for 475.

Third: This totally depends on how Im feeling/if I make weight. The state record at 165 is 530. If 495 goes well, Im going 535. The most Ive ever gotten is 195, so this is a big jump, but Id much rather go for 535 @ 25% chance than 515 with 60% chance. This is a personal goal of mine. Im gonna get this record, and Ive put myself in a position to get it next weekend with 7 years of hard work. If I dont make weight, the 530 is less of a goal. Id still go for it if 495 felt great, but I'd be more inclined to go for less.

Overall: First attempt: 1040

Second: 1135(again I'd be satisfied with this

Third: 1210-1220 - Id be absolutely estatic for this

Thanks for reading- and please provide any critique you possibly could, in new Brunswick, NJ. I hope to get 1250 at that meet.

 I was asking my coach about offseason programming and he recommended [sheiko #29](http://www.beyondlimitstraining.net/news/5112-sheiko-29-the-beyond-limits-project). I have a few questions about it that he isn't quite sure of. 

1) **Would Sheiko be an effective program for a geared lifter?** I would do it raw because getting in and out of gear when training by myself is a hassle, seem like they would not have much carryover to gear. 

2) **Is it ok to change up some of the assistance work to target the muscles used in geared lifting?** For example

3) **If the answer to both of these are yes, compete at a heavy 242, and my maxes in gear (with generous high school judging) are about 535/275/450. I am not making linear progress anymore, but pretty consistently see my numbers increase on a weekly basis.

4) **What other programs would you recommend?** I am also considering the Texas Method

Any advice is appreciated. Thank you in advance!

Total 
1035lbs(470kg)

**Overall**



Took first in my weight class, got to work on that sticking point, form definitely needs some work as well.   Not bad for a first meet.  

I've been lifting for about seven months now, at 5'10 and 138lbs, did mostly just bench and curls, the usual screw around stuff beginners do,but really got hooked around seven months ago.  


**Some Background**

I started seriously lifting in university, a former wrestler and high school weightlifter. He started to train me, and I improved quickly, soon able to match his best lifts. Granted, hes only 5'2 and barely 140 soaking wet, but it was an accomplishment to hit a 2 plate bench, 3 plate squat
	In January, 24hour Fitness and were totally turned off by some aspects of those gyms. The limited equipment, the ever-present ""No Deadlift"" rule, and the infamous 'Lunk Alarm' that I'm sure many of you are familiar with.... Anyways, we found a home.  


LionHeart Gym. Its a small gym, with low lighting, chalk covered concrete and carpeted floors, and an old-man ball sweat odor permeating the place. Its AMAZING. There are tons of iron plates, a squat rack, power cage, and 2 competition benches. Its usually empty of people, he often contributes to the noise on bench day.  

 On our first day, (whom I shadow), and world record benchers Joey Scalzo (who my friend shadows) and Leon Barry, who are all training for the Europa Expo in Orlando in 6 weeks. They  welcomed us into their workout with open arms, and we have been training with them ever since. They have been a great influence and their expertise and support has been great in preparation for this meet. I have the utmost gratitude for those guys, for helping us train and for driving with us to the competition, where they helped with equipment and technique and inspiration. They really are the best. 

**Training**  
This meet wasn't really planned for. Our first day at LionHeart

Monday-Squat and speed deadlift
Wednesday- Speed Bench and Upper Back
Friday- Deadlift
Sunday- Bench


6 weeks out - Triples to max
4
3 weeks out
2 weeks out
Last week


**Diet**  
Ate pretty healthy, occasional 50 nugget bucket from Wendy's, triweekly trips to Chipotle and all you can eat wings at Winghouse every monday. Okay, perhaps not so healthy, but I tried to stay protein heavy but always ate my fruits and veggies. 

**Supplements**  
None. Multi and fish oil.   

**Future Training**
Bulking up to 220. Going to run Joey Scalzo's bench press routine ( a modified Russian routine shortened to 8 weeks) or do Smolov for squat. Not sure yet. Deadlifts should improve with squats.
My goal is to break the Florida state record as found [here](http://apa-wpa.com/APA%20Florida%20Mens%20Records.htm) by January 19th next year. Squat will have to improve from 355lbs(161kg) to 425lbs (193kg). Bench will have to go from &gt;225lbs(102kg) to 275lbs(125kg). Deadlift will have to go from 455lbs(206kg) to 550lbs(250kg). I know damn well that Im going to shatter it. 

Any advice or thoughts would be greatly appreciated!

 I am a male in my young 20's, its an educated guess) and have been lifting for 3 years.

I started with SS and then went into a few other programs but for the last 8 months have just been lifting how I want since its been for enjoyment not progression. 

More general info:
With my lifestyle I normally sleep around 6 hours a night with 90% of the rest of my day working. I work sitting down mostly and nothing that would get my heart rate over 100 in an average day. I have done this for as long as I have been lifting but as I am down to the wire for the last few months and have 0 wiggle room

The Question: 
Can stress have a large effect on your lifts. My lifts are down 20% across the board while my body weight hasn't changed a LB in a few months. Can mental fatigue (guessing that is what it is) have such a physical impact

1374529041.0,1iua8i,How far should I take my first long newbie bulk?,TheLtOfInishmore,10,4,11,"Hey all

So, and I have been gaining weight the entire time (at a rate of no more than one pound per week, most weeks; sometimes less, almost never more). I am now the same height, at 185. In the time since last September, my numbers have all gone up substantially (they are still not satisfying, since my first numbers were absolutely horrible, and it is continuing steadily). I am planning on continuing just the way that I'm going now for a while

So, and I can see the difference in my arms and legs). However, I have also put on some fat. I wouldn't say that it's really noticeable yet, but there will come a time soon enough when an average person might look at me and think of me as ""chubby"" or something similar. I can see sort of an offensive lineman physique developing. Anyway, I plan on getting much bigger--not for competition (although I am thinking about it), but out of my own personal desire to be a big guy. I was thinking of shooting for 225 ultimately, and maybe going bigger after that. I don't mind getting kinda soft

My question is this: at what point should I end my bulk? I was thinking of bulking to 200 and cutting, has suggested 210 before cutting (and explicitly told me not to cut right now). Another friend, who is kind of a meathead, suggested that I go to 250 in a single bulk and cut from there. That idea sounds a bit extreme, as I would probably be really fat at that point, but he did make the point about preserving strength.

Can you guys offer any advice?

tl;dr: newbie powerlifter on his first long bulk. How should I balance my initial steady strength gains with turning into a fatass?

I have a quick question about Deadlifts that I was hoping you guys could help me with.

First

My question(s):

I've been thinking about starting to do Sumo Deadlifts. But I don't want to give up on my conventional Deadlifts. Just wondering what you guys think about switching back and forth Sumo and Conventional Deadlifts every other week. I heard that doing Deadlifts every week can be detrimental to your lifts and your health

That sparked my love for combat sports to which I  have ended up focusing most of my time on Brazilian Jui-Jitsu. I train in BJJ every evening and three times per week I do fitness stuff and three times per week I have been doing weights.

For about a month now I have been moving up in weights on my Squat and Dead lift. I started out with a broom stick then put on some light weights I would have spent about two months doing this.
I am 79kgs - 173lbs
deadlift 165kg - 363lbs
squat 138kg - 303lbs

So I am back to where I started and I am thinking well since I am training I may as well compete. I have got a long way to go by looking at results from meets but

1361676419.0,194541,"Meet Report: 2013 PA Teenage Powerlifting Championships, Emmaus, PA",PelicanMiracles,4,2

Some background: I am a 14 year old freshman and I compete in the JV division. I started lifting single-ply around the new year. I competed at 242, and about 170 lifters were involved. 

**Squat:**

Warmups: Pretty standard. First we stretched and did some dynamic warmups and then hit 8 or so sets

Attempts:

430

460

495

The first two attempts moved pretty easily, as collar weights and bar weights vary from meet to meet. I thought I had squatted 480 on my third! It was great to hear that I had exceeded that mark.

**Bench:**

Warmups: Similar in structure to squats. Shoulder warmup

Attempts:

225

~~245~~

~~245~~

Very disappointing. I hit 240 fairly easily in a meet last month, especially considering that I know I've been making progress in the gym on board presses, band benches, and general tricep strength, which is my biggest weakness. We haven't done shirted benches off the chest since our last meet, which may have something to do with it. Ah well, I'll get em next time.

**Deadlift:**

Warmups: I decided to only do 3 warmup sets: 135x3, but I think that is far too many. At my first meet back in December, a raw one that I entered on my own, I did my warmup method and ended up pulling a 20lb PR of 425 (I don't mean to sound superior, but it happens to work better for me). 

Attempts:

385

400

420

All three attempts felt pretty solid, but my coach has told me that we have a deadlift suit for me that would work for conventional. Unfortunately there was not enough time to train in it.

**Results:** 

I totaled 1140 and got 2nd place in JV 242 out of 7 lifters, took 1st with 1220, and my freshman buddy took 4th with 955, which was a huge improvement from his last meet. Being a team event, teams were awarded points from placing in classes. I believe we scored 52 points, with a good chunk of those coming from my class. Although I was slightly disappointed with my effort, our school did really well. I am proud to say that we took 2nd place in the competition. First went to a reform school for young men that amassed a whopping 132 points. They were amazing!

Highlights: 
 
* SHW **FRESHMAN** totaled 1570 (he was from the reform school). 
* Senior 148er from our school totaled 1130
* The people that ran the meet not understanding the Wilks formula and giving the best lifter awards based on total/bodyweight...123er with 815 won JV &amp;#3232;\_&amp;#3232;

Overall it was a good experience, USAPL HS Nationals in April, where I hope to total 1200 with some more elaborate peaking and a new DL suit. Thanks for reading!

I'm sitting at about 17-20% bf right now after a dirty bulk gone on way too long. I switched to powerlifting from bodybuilding about 6 months ago (hence the bulk continued). My lifts are going up considerable and are pretty competitive for what my original weightclass (181) would be. I'm wondering if its possible or pheasable to cut back down to 180's from 230 while still progressing fairly linearly in strength.

I'm gonna try and just use a leangains approach -10% TDEE on training days and -20% on rest days in order to try and keep my recovery up as much as possible. 

Has anyone had experience with this and not stalled out horribly bad? Should I just try and eat -10% of maintenance for a long time and dwindle down slowly while getting stronger?

Lift stats are unimpressive for my current weight

---

**Squat:** 

150kg

~~155kg~~

155kg

We didn't get much time to warm up, got 3 red flags for that. Tried it again and it went up fine.

**Bench:**

I forgot about the ""start"" call on the 105kg, which I'm icing as I type this.

200kg

This was pretty hard because the floor was uneven below the bar. I got 190 up fine

My preparation for the meet involved acknowledging my inner HAES (moving from the 242 class to the 275's) and following Tim Henriques' deadlift program in the hopes of getting my 540 competition pull up to 600. I followed the program pretty much to the letter, abandoning it after a week and a half when my biceps tendons blew up. The volume greatly improved my form and confidence, though, so it wasn't a total bust. After that, I benched twice a week working up to a 3rm one day, 3x5 the other day, both followed by incline work varying the grip for chest or triceps depending on how I felt.

As Thanksgiving rolled around, as I had to work Thursday and couldn't make the drive fast enough to hit the evening weigh-ins). A couple hours out from Vegas, Steve Denison (meet director and federation chair) calls me and tells me to haul butt in there so he doesn't have to get up early to weigh me and inspect my gear. We check into the hotel around 10:30 and I head down to the ballroom to meet the scale. I came in at 266, demonstrating my utter ineptitude at bloating.

Anyway, consume 4 grams of choline (because the diarrhea had yet to rear its watery head) and mix another 10 grams with my gatorade. Breakfast consisted of 8 or 9 star crunches, a 5 hour energy shot, and a bronkaid, leaving me plenty of time to get to the ballroom to warm up at 8:30. (Insert description of massive pre-squat dump.)


**Squat**

Warm up went as follows.

* Rumble roller, jumps

* Stare at all the monsters and wonder how badly I'm going to get crushed

* Stand awkwardly next to the ER Rack and wonder how to adjust the rack height

* Make friends with a kid from Hawaii who knows how to adjust the rack and start squatting

* 135x6ish, 415x1 (I wasn't really counting)

My opening attempt on squats was 425. Easy weight

Next was 474

Last squat was 500 for a big PR and 25 pounds more than I've ever attempted. It felt light and moved fast

My brother was in the next flight and went 3 for 3

**Bench**

Bench warmups were next. I honestly don't remember what I did here aside from popping another bronkaid and washing it down with another 5 hour energy. Might have eaten a sandwich at some point. I do remember that my shoulder was feeling good

Bench opener was 257 for an easy 3 whites. Second attempt was 286 for a 45 pound meet PR. Smoked it and called for 308. Got the weight a couple inches off my chest after playing a couple rounds of Civ IV as I waited for the press command. Shoulder said nope! and shut down. No pain

My brother went 3 for 3 again in the next flight and broke a long-standing barrier with a 352 bench.

**Deadlift**

Deadlift warmups involved refreshing myself in a bath of liniment

Opening deadlift was 507. Dang thing flew up and about knocked me over. 2 whites because my right sock wasn't pulled up as high as my left.

Next pull was 573 for a 33 pound meet PR. Came up easier than the first

I called for 601 for my last lift of the meet and a huge PR. This attempt was the culmination of all my work since August and a weight I wanted to hit before the end of the year. It came up, so I'm quite pleased with it.

My brother finished the meet 9 for 9 and pulling 650 for a 1569 total in the 308's. We each ended up taking 3rd in our weight classes and we hope to return to the Rocky Mountain Regionals next year.

That kid from Hawaii took 2nd in my weight class with a stupidly high squat and bench. Shawn Bellon spanked us both

All in all

Other highlights:

* Hanging out between attempts

* Sitting directly behind the right side judge when Chad Smith dropped his 837 pound squat attempt. Had a really good view of that mess. Not sure why there was only one scrawny spotter on each side

* No diarrhea.
