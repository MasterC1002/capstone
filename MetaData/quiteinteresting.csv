Alright listen up, then tell them to go away. They shouldn't bother you when you're on the toilet anyways.  

Gentlemen, when I discovered something truly horrifying. I had seen many disturbed subreddits in my day: I'd seen /r/WTF videos on bizzare abnormalities, I'd traveled far, far North to /r/fiftyfifty, where I'd seen all manners of horrors, and porn. Lots of porn. I've hit RandNSFW so many times I've lost count already. But nothing, NOTHING compares to what I saw there in that valley in-between the provinces of /r/funny and /r/photos that fateful day.

I saw... /r/MildlyInteresting.  It was *horrible*. The entire populace was being subjugated under the oppressive rule of mediocrity. Every last subject was forced to post banal pictures of things that were halfhearted and dull, explained in the dullest possible light! Interesting facts are *our* area of expertise! The regime has been in power for so long, that I saw to my horror that the populace outright *accepted* these injustices as the norm, settling for something only mildly interesting. I immediately ran back as fast as I could for three whole hours back here, back through the deep forests of General Ignorance, back to the Quite Interesting coastline to tell you of their plight.

Quite Interesting Ladies and Gentlemen, is not kind-of interesting, isn't uninteresting, and **ABOVE ALL** is **NOT** *MILDLY INTERESTING!* We must deliver unto them that which is *unequivocally* Quite Interesting.

**TL;DR: Ah HA! One's fallen in the trap boys! Drop the net! We've caught one!**
