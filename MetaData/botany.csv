So, sites use an all or nothing approach to searches.

I realize that the HTML is barely functional and there is little in the way of 'design' at the moment

I've also got some ideas of how to spruce up the functionality, so I can add all kinds of functionality later.

Right now, USA. This is just a starting list for developmental and practical purposes. Few other plants have been added.

I want to know what people think works and what doesn't. Which traits are useful, etc. I want it to be useful for everyone with maybe a little bit of overarching coaching/guidance (like a quick explanation of how composite flowers work, or something). I just want some input to help make it better.

Right now a help system is in place

So yeah

Hi fellow Botanists!

As some of you know

Here is what we have been talking about behind the scenes:

* A FAQ that will define what Botany is and what it is not
* Have a list of common characters and character states
* Have a link to APG III and how it relates to Evolution
* Start a weekly peer reviewed journal paper discussion
* Other ideas (your input)

In the FAQ

* What is a Plant?
* What is the difference between Botany and Horticulture?
* Can you help identify this plant for me?
* I want help building a garden for fresh vegetables and herbs
* I want to know more about careers in Botany
* How do Botanists classify plants?
* What are the parts of a flower?
* Where can I learn more about the native plants in my area?
* What are the best Botany textbooks out there right now?
* I have a question related to Botany
* How do Botanists feel about illegal plants?
* What is Arabidopsis and why do I keep seeing that name everywhere? 
* What is the current research trend in Botany?
* I want to do a botanical experiment in my free time
* What are statistics and how do they relate to Botany?
* Other questions answered (your input)

Does anyone have any input on what else to add to the FAQ? Or perhaps other ideas to help improving this subreddit? What do you wish was easily available

1351840516.0,12i6ll,An introduction to selective light training (SLT),SuperAngryGuy,26,10,12,"Introduction to selective light training (SLT)

Hey all, experimenting with duck weed (neat little plant), Fuji apple on a P-22 super dwarfing rootstock on top of the more typical plants such as tomato (both determinate and indeterminate),  peppers, basil, stevia, lettuce etc. I have no formal education, but also do theoretical and real research in chaos theory

I wanted to share a technique that I've been using for 4 years now  that can radically alter the morphology of many plants. It's patent pending and I'm only describing part of the work here. It's actually much more encompassing. I've lost most of my pics when a trojan wiped my hard drive and the external hard drive so some of the pics are going to be pics and photos printed out. It's a shame because I've spent a lot of time [light profiling plants](http://i.imgur.com/xeKfr.jpg) usually with 10-13 different light combinations and 4 seedlings (which is a bit low but I only have so much room

SLT is the selective manipulation of light sensitive proteins. I believe it's the photropin protein group that is having the main effect in what I'm doing but could also be the crytochrome protein group. Regardless, 6 hours of darkness. Which proteins are responsible for this particular phenomenon, CONSTANS, the Flowering Locus proteins, APETALA etc, I have no idea. It does add an interesting twist to the florigen hypothesis). 

How the light sticks are used is like this as shown with [C. sativa (Jack Herer)](http://i.imgur.com/dwLo5.jpg). Blue side lighting alone will not accomplish the same effect. The lights need to be up close and the light uninterrupted. The light sticks are ran and wired up parallel daisy chain such as how one would run drip emitters. In the case of the Jack Herer plant

To give some more examples, sweet basil can produce giant, more productive leaves. These techniques had very little affect on purple basil.

Here's [jalapeno](http://i.imgur.com/bGtGh.jpg) that went through SLT and what the [stem looked like](http://i.imgur.com/ls9wE.jpg) after harvest. For many plants 4-5 nodes per inch is typical.

Here's an example of another cannabis plant (unknown strain) also with [4-5 nodes per inch](http://i.imgur.com/9E8K3.jpg). The sticks are to spread the leaves so I can take the picture.

I've also been working with hardwoods like [Fuji apple](http://i.imgur.com/vddhA.jpg) and the technique appears to work as long as you hit the stem with the intense blue light before the bark forms to produce more compact apple scions. This may allow the possibility of using more productive rootstocks. I wish to try it with coffee since coffee trees tend to be pruned back to 6 feet tall every year

So, encapsulation isn't needed.

I'm only allowed 1000 word posts so I can answer questions in the comment section. I would like to point out that I'm looking for a non-profit group to give majority rights to and to bring the light sticks to market. I'm thinking of a number much higher than 51% when I say majority rights. I'm currently meeting with a large non-profit for this purpose.

As mentioned

A few years ago some of the plants developed bad fasciation and then would keel over and die. Now they will only grow a few inches before getting this problem. I can't see any sign of insect damage or signs of bacterial/fungal on the stems. The roots look rotten when I pull the plant up. IMHO it must be a virus or bacteria or maybe a fungus in the soil. No other plants in the garden show the same symptoms. 

I can't see anything online about this problem and given the harm this  plant's done in the US/Canada would anyone be interested in a sample of one of the plants/soil?

A website, social media pages, and everything more online so as to keep everyone up to date, informed, and digitally tuned in to the growing endeavor.

Two years ago i bought a supermarket phothos on a whim

The next spring(2011) i noticed a new growth out of the daughter pot and having no idea what it was i just let it grow, begat seedpods which each contained dozens of small black seeds much like poppy seeds. I cut the long stalks back a few inches to the dirt when the flower fell off past winter(2011), and now i have new flower growth this spring. 

I also planted a few of the seeds and the sprouts from those seeds are shown in the last pic of the album.

I have had no luck identifying the new plant

Is it possible that the flowering stem is a reproductive part of the pothos or did i just happen to grow a seed that errantly flown its way into my window and into my pot of soil?

I thought of pollen and honeysuckle. But fictional versions of each. A pollen that dusts everything with its yellow hue, mammal victims? 

I don't know. Point is, I look toward things on earth that already have these qualities or something similar. But this is my first attempt at plant-life, in truth.

My mom had three huge pots of Aloe Vera. When her home was foreclosed
Flash forward two years, and the remainder didn't have roots. 
I've re-potted it several times
It's been about a month since I've began giving this plant a concerted effort
I'm just freaked out because it was such a prolific plant


I know this species roots in water. Would I be better off keeping it in a small glass of water until it bounces back? Or should I just keep a close eye on it and hope that it will regain strength.

We are unsure of where we will be stationed but we are shooting for out of country, jobs, and research for the field of Botany. Since we are unsure of where we will be landing, and for matters of preference as well, I'd like to take online classes, does that sound plausible? My end goal is Enthobotany, so any information in that regard is appreciated as well.

Schooling

*1. What options do I have for where I can go to school for Botany?

*2. Do they have online classes? Is the difficulty higher than attending an actual class?

*3. What is required for a degree in Botany? Ethnobotany if you know?

*4. How long does it generally take to acquire these degrees?

*5. How much does it generally cost for the schooling?


Jobs

*1. What jobs are available in the field? What are they like?

*2. Where are these jobs located specifically? What kind of work 
environment?

*3. What are the salaries like?

*4. What are the best and worst things about working in the field?


Research

*1. What are some ways I could get started now?

*2. Where are the major research facilities and what do they research specifically?

*3. What kind of research has already been done?

*4. What kind of research is going on currently?

1376177518.0,1k463x,'The Secret Life of Plants' - making its app for smartphones,vinakss,13,8,2,"Hello everyone from Reddit community!

I am currently building a smartphone app based on 'The Secret Life of Plants' (the book or film, I was very interested in the experiments mentioned (Backster Effect, etc.). Research on the internet showed that many people have attempted to recreate the experiments by themselves. Products inspired by the book were invented, to help fans try out some experiments from the book themselves (eg. Floranium). 

I find the movement to be quite interesting, which I think is wonderful. Unfortunately, all these information are scattered and difficult to find. A concept I want to produce is a digital platform for the international fanbase of the title to find encouragement (for those who have not) to carry out their own experiments, and a sharing platform for those who have. It will be a great follow-up after the book and the film for the fans and it will bring ourselves closer to the hands-on, intriguing experiments mentioned. The problem is that many of us don't know how to even start.

I will like to bring in both experts and amateurs, you can share to the rest of the community journaling how you did it, tutorials, notes, your discoveries. It will be motivating and educational for others who are interested but lost. 

We can have a little fun with plants, children, or in school. Who knows what will come out of it? Using smartphone applications and website database, we can have beautiful experiment journals and discussions all based on The Secret Life of Plants. The phone app have multiple optional plug-ins installed (for galvanometric readings, weather, sound output, etc.) and these can be created by the community, and users are free to install plug-ins depending on their own level of participation. One clearer visual of how sophisticated the phone app could be is when we use an installed augmented reality plug-in, as data layered above one plant. Move the camera to another plant

All I can find in my quick google searches have been how to guides and I really should be studying for ecology instead of doing this so I thought I would toss this out for you guys.

I am only a sophomore but I really love the nitty gritty. Also there has been a lot of diffing opinions of the length of the clipping. It started with a leaf and grown on some cites to 2 inches of stem. While I'm sure the increased plant material helps

My first idea was to develop some baseline data for an estuary in Mexico. I was going to determine the net ariel primary productivity of a mangrove forest there. This project would be fine

Another idea I had was to figure out the diversity of foliar fungal endophytes in the same plant community (I really like this estuary). The problem here is that I don't have any mycology classes under my belt and the school lacks the necessary equipment. I know I could fund and make all of the necessary equipment

I'm mostly interested in diversity

There are a million crappy senior projects I could do that would allow me to graduate

I have been told that the senior project should be a culmination of what I've learned here during my undergrad. This got me thinking about what I've actually learned and I can't say that I've learned all that much.

As of now, but my concern is this;

What Advice on starting cuttings do you have?

I've just put them in glass bottles

The bottles are dark glass, this is so algae doesn't form/rotting doesn't occur, but maybe I'm totally wrong.

I'm guessing that different plants need different growing mediums/strategies

Alternatively you could just tell me what you definitely would NOT do when trying to induce rooting.

**Hybridization as a stimulus for the evolution of invasiveness in plants?**

*Norman C. Ellstrand and Kristina A. Schierenbeck*

**Abstract**

Invasive species are of great interest to evolutionary biologists and
ecologists because they represent historical examples of dramatic
evolutionary and ecological change. Likewise
important economically and environmentally as pests. Obtaining
generalizations about the tiny fraction of immigrant taxa that
become successful invaders has been frustrated by two enigmatic
phenomena. Many of those species that become successful only do
so (i) after an unusually long lag time after initial arrival
after multiple introductions. We propose an evolutionary mechanism
that may account for these observations. Hybridization between
species or between disparate source populations may serve
as a stimulus for the evolution of invasiveness. We present and
review a remarkable number of cases in which hybridization
preceded the emergence of successful invasive populations. Progeny
with a history of hybridization may enjoy one or more
potential genetic benefits relative to their progenitors. The observed
lag times and multiple introductions that seem a prerequisite
for certain species to evolve invasiveness may be a correlate of
the time necessary for previously isolated populations to come into
contact and for hybridization to occur. Our examples demonstrate
that invasiveness can evolve. Our model does not represent the
only evolutionary pathway to invasiveness
mechanism worthy of more consideration in explaining
the evolution of invasiveness in plants.
