You'll need:

* 1 tsp. olive oil 

* One pound of fresh jalapeños. (Or serranos

* a cup of Parmesan cheese

* one of those 8 oz. bricks of cream cheese, you fat fuck. 

* Chorizo. (If its one of those rings

* some of your favorite hot sauce (I use spontaneous combustion or ass blaster)

* 2 beers

* some music

**okay


1. Open one of the beers and let it breathe.

2. Preheat the oven to about 420

3. Heat that oil in a medium pan. How hot? High medium. I set my stove to a six.  Let that shit heat and spread. You know

4. Drink some of that beer.

5. Make the chorizo.  You know

6. Slice those peppers in half

7. Finish off that first beer and think about what you've done. 

8. Mix the cream cheese

9. Spoon that shit into the pepper halves and arrange them in a big ass baking dish. 

10. Throw the whole fucking thing into the oven for 20 minutes or so and knock back that second beer. By the time it's done you'll be buzzed enough to not care if you fucked something up along the way. 

11. Eat up

The burn wore off fairly quickly, and I've broken bones in the past. I'm wondering if there is a way I can reduce these flashes of pain, as they are bordering unbearable.

I've tried the following with varying levels of success:

* Cold Shower
* Cold Water
* Puking (This helped quite a bit
* Laying still in bed
* Writhing around in pain

[I grow my own peppers.](http://i.imgur.com/rTo7T.jpg) Those are habaneros and red savinas

[Here's the setup.](http://i.imgur.com/RrIen.jpg)

[Blender full with palate cooler.](http://i.imgur.com/xTa1z.jpg)

[Finished product](http://i.imgur.com/ODd7L.jpg) with homemade labels

It's supposed to be Jamaican style (I couldn't swear to it) - it's hot, but doesn't burn your mouth like some sauces, but after a little while you'll notice your scalp is sweating like mad.

    12 or more fresh habanero chiles - roughly chopped
    1 Ripe mango - peel
    1 c Cheap yellow prepared mustard
    1/4 c Brown sugar - packed
    1/4 c White vinegar
    1 tb Prepared curry powder
    1 tb Ground cumin
    1 tb Chili powder
    Salt and freshly cracked black pepper - to taste

No need to cook it - just throw it all in a blender, which was super hot. I used canned pineapple and mango here because I couldn't find decent fresh ones at the time.

""
This aromatic, which is ridiculously easy:

--
**Ingredients:**

* 2  Tbsp. whole coriander seeds
* 2  Tbsp. whole cumin seeds
* 2  Tbsp. dried crushed red chile pepper or chili flakes (more if you can take it

* 2 garlic cloves
* 1/2 squeezed lemon
* 3-4-5 Tbsp olive oil (until it's a nice paste
* Salt to taste

---
 **How to:**

* 1) Grind the spices thoroughly in a mortar and pestle. (adding some salt when grinding makes it easier)

* 2) Add cloves

* 3) Add the Lemon juice

* 4) Done. Eat with anything. (why not lamb roast, grilled Squid, Halloumi salad, kebab, pizza, hamburgers, mix with mayo

* 5) Enjoy legendary status among friends

--------------------------------------------------------------


 **Variations:**

* Soak the dried chile in a dash of boiling water for 20 min before grinding.

* Add chopped fresh chiles

* Lightly dry-roast the cumin and coriander seeds before grinding (adds smokiness

* Add 3 Tbsp. Hungarian sweet paprika and some extra oil (to make it more sweet
or
* Add 3 Tbsp. Sriracha chile sauce ( recommended!

* A pinch of sugar can also lift the taste

* Add Caraway seeds too ( 1-2 Tbsp )

* Some people like to add skinned

* Add chopped shalottes

NOTE:
**A very much recommended** twist on this sauce is to chuck a whole red bell pepper (paprika/capsicum) or two in the oven on max heat, chop it up finely or mash it and add to the sauce.. (If you are a Chile-head you do this same thing with large red chillies like Rocoto!) The resulting roasted paprika mash gives a sweet, deep flavour that enrichens the sauce, and as a matter of fact, your life.""

**Cooking the beast:**
Having spent an outrageous amount of money on Jerk Chicken from the takeaways in Shepherd's Bush lately I decided to have a go. As I often use a slow cooker to make a weeks worth of food at a time it's worth mentioning that I did not go for a traditional Jerk Chicken dish. What I actually did was take the flavours from Jerk Chicken and turn it into a curry/chilli style dish.
Playing on the sweet afterburn of a Scotch Bonnet I opted to use celeriac and pineapple as my ""vegetables"" (half of a large one of each) along with one and a half onions and a kilo of chicken breast.
Having not cooked Jerk Chicken before I cheated somewhat and picked up an off the shelf marinade by Dunns River. A quarter of a teaspoon taster of this showed it to be quite fiery with a good amount of flavour as one would expect from a Jerk sauce. I coated the chicken liberally in the sauce and left for 8 hours during which time I diced the pineapple and celeriac

**Ingredients:**
1kg Chicken Breast
1 and 1/2 small onions
2 tins Chopped Tomatoes
1/2 Jar Dunn's River Jerk Marinade
3x Dried Scotch Bonnet peppers
1/2 Celeriac
1/2 Pineapple

I recently picked up an ounce of dried ghost peppers. I have about a quarter pound of habaneros on hand, etc... but no onion... I hate onions). On the first try I was thinking about using 2 ghost peppers and maybe 4-5 habaneros.

My plan is to blend all the ingredients together, then sample when cooled.

Is there anything I should keep in mind? Any fun additional ingredients I can add? Any advice is appreciated!

UPDATE:

It turned out great. I used ghost peppers, garlic, salt, pepper, cumin, a little bit of vegetable oil, and about a quarter cup of Zombie Dust (IPA). It was pretty damn spicy but not so much so that it was only hot that you could taste. I'm pretty proud of how it turned out, so I ended up placing them on my forehead most of the time. I couldn't find a respirator on short notice so I got a surgical mask from walgreens and wrapped a bandanna around it. That worked well I think, and everything turned out fine. Thanks for all your help.

As I was scraping the last bit of mustard out of my last jar with a pretzel stick


&gt; Ingredients: Premium prepared mustard


I felt like the little girl in the Jurassic Park movie


**Recipe (makes 8 ounces)**  

* 0.5 to 1 Ghost / Bhut Jolokia pepper
* 1 to 2 Habanero peppers
* 8 ounces of prepared mustard  


**Process**


* Cut the stems off the peppers and cut them in halves or quarters.
* (Optional) Remove seeds and pith (I didn't).
* Puree the peppers in a food processor to medium-fine.  Mine has a mini-bowl
* Add the mustard and puree until thoroughly mixed.  
* Spoon the mustard back into the jar (a funnel helps).  


That's it.  The results were spot-on with the real CaJohn's mustard and it's even better after a day or two.  I'm looking forward to experiments with different mustards and peppers.

1 delicious pear
2 golden plums
1 large lemon
1 lb peeled garlic
1.5 lbs habanero peppers
1 tbsp salt
lemon juice

Combine ingredients in blender and puree until homogenized (3-4 minutes). If it is too think to blend, add a tablespoon of lemon juice at a time does. It should look like and have the consistency of a smoothie.

Once homogenized

Make about 1qt. Refrigerates well up to 1 year.

---

For the cioppino I mixed two tbsp paste with a stick of melted butter. Bake until done and add cooked fish to water. No need to add anything else.

1 part paste with 1 part cream cheese on a tortilla and generous amounts of shredded chedder cheese and toasted with butter for an awesome casadia. Also goes well with shredded beef

One of my all time favorite creations was hot sauce with butter, spread on homemade sour loaf, topped with minced grilled beef tenderloin (cooked in the bacon fat obviously), roasted garlic, parmesan, and sharp white cheddar. Broiled till brown.

1tsp to a bowl of ramen for a bit of a kick.

Oddly enough

If you are a real heat freak

My favorite things about this hot sauce are that it keeps me from having to handle hot peppers every time I want to add some flavor to a dish

1351427337.0,127szl,How to make red chicken enchiladas,TheKingOfPoon,19,4,6,"Just made these and they were pretty much perfect

Ingredients:

4 chicken breasts

2 small white onions

5 cloves of garlic

tablespoon chicken bouillon

teaspoon marjoram

teaspoon thyme

salt

pepper

3 large plum type tomatoes

3 bay leaves

coriander (seed)

dried red chiles (guajillo, puya, etc.)

1 Trinidad Scorpion

5 chiltepins

cumin

oregano

sugar

butter or lard

oil

corn tortillas


I started by poaching the chicken.  Bone-in skin-on chicken would be preferable but all I had was boneless skinless chicken breasts.  I put 4 chicken breasts in a pot, 2 cloves of garlic cut in half, about a teaspoon of Knorr's Caldo con Sabor De Pollo (basically chicken bouillon), about a teaspoon of marjoram, a teaspoon of thyme, some salt and pepper, a few bay leaves, [pulled the chicken out and shredded it using my fingers


The liquid and everything from the pot used to flavor the chicken is now basically flavored chicken stock which is used to make the enchilada sauce.

Next up is the most important part

[I used about 6 guallijo


Tear the dried chiles into pieces, along with a fresh Trinidad Scorpion cut in half, and about 5 chiltepins cut in half.

[Next


[Let it boil on med-high for about half an hour until the dried chiles become soft


If the sauce is a little thin

Next, place some of the chicken in the corn tortillas, role the tortilla around the chicken, and [place them seam side down in the pan.](http://i.imgur.com/hKZmu.jpg)


Pour more sauce over them

Take them out, some Mexican sour cream, or whatever tickles your fancy.  [The finished product](http://i.imgur.com/JcKPi.jpg)

Well it's been about a month since I canned my first hot sauce from my own peppers so last night I decided to have a ""Wing Ding"" at my friends place to try it out.

I made about 75 wings (doing the Alton Brown steam n' bake) and made up Hot &amp; Butter sauces (1 stick of butter to 2 jars of sauce) from my red and green sauces

The sauce was a smash hit! Everyone loved the red sauce the best and throughout the end of the meal were even dipping garlic bread into the extra sauce to eat it. The red's spicy level was perfect

The green was quite a different flavour from the garlic added to it but was unique enough to stand on it's own (and one person picked it as their favourite).

I will definitely be doing this again next year!

I love those boxes of rice I buy from the store

Id like to find a way to make my own, coriander, etc). Id add probably some veggies like onion, bell pepper, serrano pepper,  and other stuff into the rice as well. Any advice on how to cook rice and what to add to make it taste awesomely spicy and delicious?",,self,,

As I was pulling the stems

Started with about a quarter near the stem. About five minutes later I ate the bottom quarter from that side. It was hot

About 15 minutes later I ate the other half. Give me props. No milk or dairy products in the house in case it became unbearable!

I really don't want to come off as a douche here

They're hot, watery eyes... The good stuff! :)

I wouldn't want to cook with 'em a lot because I think the heat could easily overpower the flavor of the food - which I like.
