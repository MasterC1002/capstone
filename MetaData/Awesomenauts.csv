* Holding LMB charges heal
* You have to click LMB again to start charging again.
* If you click too early after releasing

The result is that Voltar either needs to spam click to do constant healing

This behavior is a problem for a few reasons:

* Unintuitive
* Frustrating to a player who mistimes the LMB click and realizes later that he isn't charging.
* Requires lots of LMB clicks throughout the game
* Requires held LMB in periods of inactivity (getting ready) instead of only during use.

You could fix this easily

* While not holding LMB
* Pressing LMB performs charged heal.  
* Holding LMB performs repeat small heals

If you aren't interested in doing that fix, it starts charging the heal immediately after the heal cooldown has completed.  That would remove the annoyance of missing your timing without making the heal speed any faster.",,False,self,t5_2tvrv,False,Random,

1371645770.0,1gngtr,How to deal with Ayla,Mindcide,59,9,34,"Edit:  I hate the title

Foreword:  I have a day off work and I'm bored.  Therefore

I've been seeing a lot of frustration from people when playing against Ayla, demanding nerfs and seeking advice.  I was the same on day 1 of her release, she destroyed me in every game I played and I couldn't figure out what was going wrong.  Since I couldn't figure it out, I got frustrated.  

Since then, as it's small enough already and no one should feel like quitting due to a new hero giving them grief.  

Firstly, near to a turret.  This is especially important if you're playing a slower hero without an escape mechanism.  Vertical movement is useful too, alternate between jump pads and exploiting the speed of falling to widen the gap.  Use a buddy system, when in a pair you become exponentially more safe, just try not to stand exactly on top of each other when in combat with Ayla.  Teamwork is paramount to fighting her, so always work with your teammates.  

The other major weapon in combating Ayla is crowd control.  Every kind of crowd control is a great help against her, snares and such as standard, due to the popularity of Ayla and the effectiveness it brings to defeating her.  These two seemingly obvious tips are generic to any hero, but there are more character specific measures that can be taken too (note I don't use item names, I imagine newer players still haven't learned all the names, so I'll be using descriptions):

**TLDR so far**:  Don't duel her; stay as a group.  Crowd control and mobility improvement is king.  Knockbacks are the ultimate answer.  

**Froggy G**- Froggy has a relatively easy time staying alive vs Ayla but a tougher time actually fighting back.  His dash gives him superior mobility in times of strife

&gt; TLDR Frog:  Shield on whirlwind

**Lonestar** - All the rage and whine on all the forums concerning Ayla doesn't compare to the rage an Ayla player feels when she messes with the bull.  It knocks her further back than everyone else due to her lesser friction mechanic while in rage-mode and can consistently save yourself and teammates alike.  Blindamite is also worth considering

&gt; TLDR Cowboy:  Be bullshit bull bully.  Blind on dynamite.  Shove hard when you force her away.  

**Leon** - Leon has a real rough time duelling Ayla.  Avoiding her as much as possible for the early game is advisable, as they provide her with free healing.  

&gt; TLDR Lizard:  1v1 = no.  Silence tongue.  Work with team or avoid Ayla.    

**Clunk** - The easiest and most stress-free method of dealing with Ayla is simply playing Clunk.  This guy is such a hilarious hard-counter to Ayla that I feel like I'm insulting your intelligence by explaining it.  One rank in snare bite and buffing up explode then auto attack will force Ayla to never come near you

&gt; TLDR Robot:  Crazy hard counter.  Get your crunk on

**Voltar** - Voltar has received a lot of flak for being close to useless recently, as there'll always be a target that needs healing.  Consider blind on drones for added safety, as Ayla a *lot* faster than you.  

&gt; TLDR Brain:  Knockbacks are essential.  Pair up.  Blind drones.  Don't overextend.  

**Gnaw** - Gnaw can have a bad time if you have an aggressive play style.  Gnaw is my main, two weedlings mustn't be placed within an Ayla-rage-diametre of each other, or she'll gain more health than losing when she's clearing them.  I find the best way is to get improved weedling health and then focus on damage over time on spit and bite and using a hit-and-run defensive style.  Try out slow on spit as you essentially have nothing else to widen the gap if she's chasing you, but the best method is never step out too far in the first place.  

&gt; TLDR Bug: Spread out weedlings

**Coco** - Probably the most fun hero to play when confronting an Ayla.  Coco's kit allows her to torment a chasing Ayla with slows and knock backs and I'm sure any Coco mains are not the ones on the forums doing the whining.  Put blaze onto your ball

&gt; TLDR Surfer:  You are allowed to duel Ayla.  Increased slows recommended.  

**Skolldir** - I find Skolldir's effectiveness can swing either way.  His potential is immense, providing you some presence to protect smaller team mates.  

&gt; TLDR Fatman:  Be mindful of flings.  Get stun.  Protect allies.  

**Yuri** - Yuri has an abysmal early game against Ayla.  She's faster, you're probably already dead.  You need certain items on time warp to move further out of the safe zone, specifically +slow and +size and boots will be enough to actually escape Ayla, temporarily.  Since it's not in Yuri's nature to spend a lot of time with your land faring allies, try to just be where Ayla isn't and shove the lanes.  

&gt; TLDR Monkey:  Slow&amp;size on time warp.  Pre-emptive avoidance or death until then.  

**Raelynn** - Raelynn is capable of holding her own, as well as giving the perfect opportunity for a snipe.  After this combo, if she doesn't run then she probably wont have the hp to bring you down.  Blind on your snipe is also an option, if you're goal is getting her to rage-quit.  

&gt; TLDR Sniper: Keep your distance

**Derpl** - I don't really play this guy
*Paraphrased from* /u/Dwel111 - Liberal usage of nukes is recommended as well as investing in damage reduction for turret mode.  Ayla will have trouble trading since she must be on top of you

&gt; TLDR Slug:  Snare traps.  Snare traps everywhere.  Turret up with +shield and win trades using melee nukes.  

**Vinnie** - Similar to Derpl, so juke using cloud until she's low enough to execute, but be *extremely* careful of her doing the same to you.  Don't try to fight her alone, use skills to escape if you're caught out.  

&gt; TLDR Fish:  Aid team with jukes using cloud

**Genji** - Cocoon is the shit.  This is the only ability that I'm aware of that can turn off rage mode

&gt; TLDR Worm:  Both abilities hard counter Ayla.  Play the role of support and feed Ayla to your teammates.  

**Ayla** - Ayla vs Ayla, they'll try to dodge each other while simultaneously damaging the foe.  Insanity.  Anyway, this matchup is all about timing your evil eye nuke ability, knowing the numbers and when to strike.  If you do it first and don't get the kill, chances are his will now hit harder and it's over.  Ayla players will already have some intuition for when to do this, so my advice would be redundant.  

&gt; TLDR New Girl:  What happens when an unstoppable force meets another fucking unstoppable force?  

.

Other useful elements to your meta game are maintaining a degree of map control.  Tower hugging in both lanes isn't ideal in any team composition

Hopefully there's something amongst this wall of words that helps you out when head butting a wall to soothe the pain of dealing with Ayla.  The community is small enough as is without an exodus of players leaving due to frustration

If there are any strategies you have found out yourself to help combat this new and exciting hero

**TL;DR Everything** - Ayla tough shit yo, be Clunk.

**UPDATE PLEASE READ**

I've given it some thought.  If you want to back out after reading the following

1) **I'm getting rid of the experienced player upgrade limitation rule.  Whoever is your experienced player (20+hrs) is allowed whatever build order they wish.**
I'm a one Naut show setting up this tourney and I can imagine the headache I'm going to get next week scrutinizing everyone's screenshot after every match to see if they upgraded 'correctly.'  The original purpose of the upgrade handicap rule was to make the veteran players less intimidating...however the community response to this event has been nothing short of awesome.  I'm getting veterans willing to step up to mentor new players as well as fill in a team spot they desperately need.  

2) I will be putting a hard cap on the amount of players that may compete in the tourney.  I want to make sure there is an equal amount of teams in the brackets I form.  The best way to go about it?  I'll form as many teams as possible during the weekend from the spreadsheet I have, the team with the less experience from my spreadsheet in terms of hours/level will get the bye.

3) You are allowed one substitute player on your team to improve your schedule options.  One thing I learned from the APL is that there will ALWAYS be a reason for a sub.  Please note having one experienced player on your team still applies and I'll have to spot check them as I do with all player competing.


**TD;LR - You still can have only one experienced player, and you are allowed one sub player in case someone on your team is unable to play a match for any reason.**


Here's a [rough spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AvI4Rzu6kQKWdGh1eTMtcW5fRzY0STRKYmlpSDBGNHc&amp;usp=sharing) of where I'll be placing the information as well as tournament bracket.

Lets see how much buzz we can get for this.  Whether it takes off or not will determine if we have the tourney.  If we can even form four teams I will be a happy Naut.

What I need from you is to post under this thread the following:

* Steam Name
* Hours played
* Current Level
* Are you looking for teammates?  If you already have a team

Right now first prize for the team that wins is three copies of **Swords and Soldiers** which unlocks the [Voltar Necro Skin](http://www.awesomenauts.com/Necrovoltar/index.html)

**Rules:**

* Maximum hours logged into the game will be 20 (exceptions below)
* Best of 3
* No switching characters mid game
* No build-changing exploits allowed (disconnect from game
* Any build is fine
* Maps are random for first game then losing team picks map
* Results of each match are to be screenshot (F12 when playing the game) by the team captain and sent to me via Steam link.  If you need help

**Sign ups end Sunday

*The matches will occur over the course of several days starting on **Monday, June 14.  Semifinals and finals will be played out on June 14-15th.*

The reasoning behind a week long tourney is to accommodate those from different time zones, this game is awesome, but it's okay if things suddenly happen where you have to postpone for a day or two.

Each team captain has the responsibility of contacting the opposing team to coordinate their matches.  If you are unable to reach out to them and are missing in action to play

I'll do my best to find teammates for those looking but check out the 'Community Resources' on the right column of this Reddit for help.

I understand the 20hrs maximum and levels will change as you practice with your teammates.  As such

For those who become the 'odd naut' out and can't find players.  Experienced players (+20hrs) will be able to step up and be added to your team.

* Only one experienced player is allowed in each team.  Which means you MUST find another beginner/novice level player for your team to qualify.

Have fun!  **AND SPREAD THE WORD**

As you play the game, etc.  Have an awesome friend in real life, but they don't have the game?  Gift it!

But no. Even besides Genji's *cost reduction* in regards to attack speed  upgrade

Let me explain. Aiguillon's main feature is the stealth orb. This stealth orb is a great boon to characters like Clunk or Derpl, see below) is Voltar. Voltar, even ignoring the drones issue, has no real use for invisibility. It breaks on healing, which he does even out of combat, and he gains very little tactical advantage from its positioning benefits.

Besides this, based on the fact that they still shoot while invisible, potentially killing even turrets. The fact this bug made it through beta, though, is a bit worrying.

As an additional note, Voltar can often get 'stuck'(sometimes unable to jump on platforms going down) on moving platforms, which are in no short supply in Aiguillon. Though the issue isn't Voltar-exclusive, it's also worthy of note that his jump's height often leaves him just shy of ledges on the map, making him wait a long while on elevators.

It's awfully stressful how Voltar feels the least compatible of any Naut with the new map

Anyone else feel similarly?

Thanks!)

Hello fellow Redditnauts! I've noticed that recently there has been a large influx of people joining this sub

*  ***""I'm new to this game and don't really get how it works

&gt;Awesomenauts is a MOBA game. I see a lot on here people coming from different kinds of MOBA games (LoL, or base. To do this, you and your teammates have to guide droids (bots, creeps) to these turrets to act as a meat shield of sorts so your team can dish some damage out to the turret without getting hurt yourself. At the same time you want to kill enemy droids as well as enemies and collect solar (the shiny cubes that they drop). Then you must use this solar to buy upgrades and abilities for your character (these are predefined before the game starts). Try not to die while trying to kill everything that you can, and you'll be great.

* ***""I'm not sure which Naut I should play./Which Naut is best/worst?""***

&gt;This question is purely subjective. In this game, for the most part, pretty balanced. Every Naut (character) is different and has a different play style. When you start the game you will only have a limited selection of characters. Try playing a few practice rounds and reading some guides online. Below is a rough description of the roles of each character.
&gt;
&gt;[Lonestar](http://awesomenauts.wikia.com/wiki/Sheriff_Lonestar): Pusher
&gt;
&gt;[Froggy G](http://awesomenauts.wikia.com/wiki/Froggy_G): Brawler
&gt;
&gt;[Leon](http://awesomenauts.wikia.com/wiki/Leon_Chameleon): Assassin
&gt;
&gt;[Clunk](http://awesomenauts.wikia.com/wiki/Clunk): Tank
&gt;
&gt;[Voltar](http://awesomenauts.wikia.com/wiki/Voltar_the_Omniscient): Healer
&gt;
&gt;[Yuri](http://awesomenauts.wikia.com/wiki/Yuri): Support
&gt;
&gt;[CoCo](http://awesomenauts.wikia.com/wiki/Coco_Nebulon): Harasser
&gt;
&gt;[Derpl](http://awesomenauts.wikia.com/wiki/Derpl_Zork): Tank
&gt;
&gt;[Gnaw](http://awesomenauts.wikia.com/wiki/Gnaw): Defensive
&gt;
&gt;[Skølldir](http://awesomenauts.wikia.com/wiki/Sk%C3%B8lldir): Brawler
&gt;
&gt;[Raelynn](http://awesomenauts.wikia.com/wiki/Raelynn): Sniper
&gt;
&gt;[Vinnie and Spike](http://awesomenauts.wikia.com/wiki/Vinnie_%26_Spike): Assassin

* ***""How do I beat a turtle Derpl that just hides behind a turret/base?""*** 

&gt;[This thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/Awesomenauts/comments/15vk5w/how_do_u_beat_this_derpl_just_sitting_at_his_base/) offers some solid advice on how to deal with turtles in general. 

* ***""Where are my stats for my Naut? Speed

&gt;When you are selecting your item loadout

* ***""What build is best for _____?""***

&gt;The [wiki](http://awesomenauts.wikia.com/wiki/Category:Awesomenauts) has some builds on there for you to try out. As with any moba game
&gt;Focus on the role and game style that you want your individual character to use. This is the most important tip as it will allow you to have a uniformity in your gameplay. For example
&gt;Think of the possible builds your opponents are using. Try thinking of how it might counter your build or what you might need to build in order to counter theirs.
&gt;Try to be flexible. Sometimes you might find your build is rather useless. In order to make your build not so useless against certain nauts try adding upgrades that you would normally not use except end game or certain situations.

* ***""Should I get Piggy Bank or Solar Tree?""***

&gt;[This video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wAaYLL6IPs) does a wonderful job of explaining the pros and cons of each. A summary is Piggy bank if you want the early advantage. Solar Tree if you are playing for late game.

* ***""How do I get better?""***
&gt;Play the game even when you are losing. If you are getting frustrated from joining games in progress then try playing some practice rounds to hone your skill. Remember, we were all noobs once!

* ***""What's that duck by your name?""***

&gt;It stands for community helper.

* ***I think that someone might be hacking or abusing the system. What do I do?***

&gt;Is he really hacking, endless Leon clones, etc.). If you see this going on, take screenshots (F12 key by default on Steam) and send a copy of your log file* and the screenshots to cheating@ronimo-games.com. Please report these guys. They take the fun out of everything.
&gt;
&gt;* Log File = VERY IMPORTANT. Find it at ""C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\Steam\steamapps\common\awesomenauts on PC

* ***""What is Solar and how do I use it?""***

&gt;Solar is the in game currency used to buy new upgrades for your naut when you go back to base. It can be gained in many ways and is necessary to level up and to be able to stay competitive against the enemy team. Solar also comes in two forms
&gt;
&gt;Solar can be obtained by:
&gt;
&gt;Every 2 seconds of gameplay you are given 1 solar
&gt;
&gt;Picking it up around the field - worth 1 or 5 solar
&gt;
&gt;Killing or looting droids or gnaws weedling - worth 5 solar
&gt;
&gt;Killing neutral creeps - worth 3 solar
&gt;
&gt;Killing or looting super droids - worth 25 solar 
&gt;
&gt;Destroying a turret - 50 to killer/dropped if killed by bots + 30 for team
&gt;
&gt;Killing enemy Naut - 60 to killer/dropped if killed by bots + 30 for team
&gt;
&gt;Killing a Solar Boss - worth 30 solar
&gt;
&gt;Picking it up during the drop at the beginning of the game or after death or by having purchased an upgrade to increase solar.
&gt;
&gt;*Note: Dying will count as a loss of 30 solar


* ***""How do the in game levels work?""***

&gt;At the beginning of every game
&gt;
&gt;*Note: You begin the with 200 solar, but rather having more money, having a better farm, different upgrades/build.

* ***""Is there a way I can see what upgrades the other/my own team has?""***

&gt;Yes, but rather just the picture of each, so you will have to be familiar with what they are to understand it.
&gt;
&gt;*Note: It will not display whether or not it is a multi-tier upgrade or how many tiers they have bought

First post soiled woop

A year or so ago I remember hearing about Awesomenauts and thinking ""ugh another crazy complicated MOBA I'll never be good at or have fun with."" It was one of TotalBiscuits' WTF is... videos and my interest was piqued but not enough to care so I just putz around not thinking of it for quiet a bit. Then, enjoyable, challenging, and frankly the loud ass intro monkey... A few weeks later my friend Kirean bought it after seeing me playing it on his steam friends list. From here the snowball begins.

Soon after all of my friends in mumble heard us laughing, then more, then the ones that couldn't I bought a copy or two for, then my friends bought a copy or two to gift away. From this I went from being the only one having it over 16 of my friends owning the game. With close to 170+ hours and over $35 spent on this game(extra copies, humble bundles, and skin packs) I feel I still under paid. I have my strong opinions about the games balance and ""pro league"" potential but who doesn't have a thought or two about balance. That aside I have played this game for close to 8+ months and have never had more fun in any multiplayer game yet. I wanted to use my first post to say thanks to Ronimo for being total bosses when it came to the attitude towards this game, its pricing policies, updates,,1372985164.0

### DO:

---

* **Report the suspected cheater directly to Ronimo.**

The instructions on how to do so are available [in this topic](http://www.awesomenauts.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=6&amp;t=3480) on their forums.

* **Leave the game.**

A cheater is playing online to win against humans

### DO NOT:

---

* **Publicly accuse the suspected cheater in-game.**

If you're incorrect in your suspicions and make a bad call, with the game's community if you were playing honestly but still being accused of cheating on a regular basis?  

Just report them to Ronimo

* **Publicly accuse the suspected cheater out of the game.**

As above.  Remember, sometimes it's just the way the game is intentionally designed.  You may not know the whole story; let Ronimo sort it out instead by reporting the suspected cheater to them.

* **Give the suspected cheater attention.**

Again, you'll rob them of the attention they're *desperately* seeking; by posting up something on the Ronimo forums or on this subreddit afterwards, you're just *giving them that attention anyways.*  The reason they're cheating is to get the attention of others. 

***Don't give them it.***

So I was bored looking at the leaderboard and as a stat major I decided to just look at how much of each naut is played in league 1.

Not much more to it than that.
So for the top 250 players the ""favorite"" nauts total as follows.

Lonestar: 69 (27.6%)
Froggy G: 52 (20.8%)
Yuri: 18 (7.2%)
Genji: 18 (7.2%)
Derpl Zork: 17 (6.8%)
Skoldir: 16 (6.4%)
Vinnie and Spike: 14 (5.6%)
Clunk: 13 (5.2%)
Raelynn: 11 (4.4%)
Leon: 9 (3.6%)
Coco: 8 (3.2%)
Gnaw: 3 (1.2%)
Voltar: 2 (0.8%)

Now what does this all mean. Well not a lot.  Unsurprising to most Lonestar and Froggy G are both really high in number of favorites while Voltar and Gnaw are both very low.  The rest are fairly moderate in number (accounting for the outliers).

Now the reason for all of this isn't exact.  You can make cases for class balance or broken-ness (underpowered and overpowered) but it's also important to look at naut synergy and of course personal preference (for example not liking their voice

So what does this all mean?  Not a whole lot.  Most of it isn't surprising (Froggy and Lonestar are high in numbers

2. Being mindful of the in-game command feature. Pounding the ""Defend"" button 3 dozen times isn't being constructive.

I do ask one thing of you: if you post a question, I want it out there.

* *When will Ronimo fix the D/C-issue?* Bad because we don't know. Use your brain here

1) Create two leagues

2) One league that is made up of those who logged in less than 40.  However

Rules are no changing characters midgame.  Maps are random for first game then losing team picks map.  Also players can only use the first three skills in each row (many beginners don't have all skills unlocked) with the exception of the bottom row (i.e.I health, semifinals best of 5, final best of 7.

I typically run with my buddy who plays Voltar. I discovered a new sort of meta-strategy:

*When you have a Voltar

I (as V&amp;S) ran around the map on occasion and nabbed all the health, because we had the Voltar.

But the problem when you have a Voltar is that the enemy team has almost exclusive access to the health

By grabbing all the health, it enhances your pushing capabilities.

I actually find that I hunt down the health MORE when I have a Voltar with great healing than when I do not. The reasoning is simple: I have an alternative for health

Oh

td;dr Health Denial is a powerful tool

EDIT: I should have specified that this works best on the gravity well level where all the health is at the top. The levels with sides are a judgement call on who will need what health when.

Minor fixes

- Fixed that if you joined late in a game
- Fixed that bots on Aiguillon sometimes got stuck on the middle teamwall if all the turrets in only one lane had been destroyed.
- Fixed that the minimap showed a health orb in the wrong place in Ribbit IV.
- Made some changes to hopefully fix a rare issue that particles sometimes did not disappear and remained in the level during the entire match. Not entirely sure

This post is meant to direct you the original FAQ (as in

Skim through and find what you need; it's a long list :P

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

&gt; What's the objective?

* The objective of the game is to destroy the other team's Drill Core before they destroy yours. Preventing you from doing so is 3-4 turrets

&gt; How do I destroy turrets?

* You can't normally take down a turret by yourself. That's what the droid's are here for. Droids spawn from your base in pairs, and removing anything in their way is the proper way to destroy a turret.

&gt; What is my loadout?

* Your loadout is the grid-screen that you see before you enter the match. When you pick your character

&gt; How do I buy my loadout items?

* When your rocket drops

&gt; Is there a way to see how much health you have?

* You can see the amount of health your 'naut starts with when you're at the character selection screen. In-game

&gt; How do I regain health?

* Health can be regained by the following methods:

1. Standing in the green shop area quickly refills your health. Teleporting back here for spending and healing is advised if you are significantly low. 

2. Grabbing the big green health orbs yield 50 HP. These spawn regularly throughout the map in the same position every time.

3. Killing the small ""neutral creeps"" gives you a small green health orb.

4. Purchasing Med-I-Can (bottom row of most Awesomenaut loadouts) gets you health regeneration. (2hp/second* per level)

5. Recieve healing from Voltar

6. Purchase a lifestealing ability (some 'nauts don't have any).

&gt; How do I ""level up""?

* Your in-game level (the number next to your name) goes up one level per 100 solar (money). Your level dictates nothing and is swayed solely by the amount of solar that you've made.

&gt; How do I make solar (money)?

* You can make solar a few ways: 

1. You automatically generate solar at 1 solar per 2 seconds (and you start with some solar when you start/join a game). Solar generation can be increased to 53 solar/minute via the ""Solar Tree"" upgrade (in the bottom row of all Awesomenauts)
2. The ""Piggy Bank"" utility upgrade gives you an extra 150 solar to start the match (bottom row of all Awesomenauts).
3. Picking up ""solar cubes"". Silver cubes grant you 1 solar
4. Killing enemies grants you 60 solar
5. Killing neutral creeps (the small
6. Killing enemy droids yields 5 solar. 
7. Destroying Turrets grants the killer 50 solar
8. Healing (voltar only)

&gt; What benefit is there to prestiging?

* None! Upon reaching level 95*, but some don't like the tediousness of it.

&gt; How do I [all] chat?

* Shift+Enter at the same time.

&gt; What is my rank?

* Your rank is determined by your spot on the leaderboards which are

&gt; What do skins do?

* Skins are obtained via promotional events or are otherwise directly purchasable through Steam. They have no effect on gameplay and are just re-textures of existing Awesomenauts (with some audio changes).

&gt; Will there be new characters?

* Yes! Ronimo is great about constantly updating the game with new skins

*Fixes courtesy of /u/MrMrUm and /u/ehkoe

This February I went over to a friends house and there are three grown men sitting about a foot from a 52"". They are high fiving and cursing in unison and rambling about frogs and droids and lag. It looks like a cartoon or some sweet SNES game I somehow missed. Then comes my turn. I get roflstomped by some large guy that explodes. Anyway, how to be patient and take advantage of power plays. Falling deeper into addiction. I didn't care that double bullet frog was op and broken. I didn't care voltar was useless in quick match and you couldn't trust random gamers to know how to play (even more crippling on consoles since you can't even type for communication). I just love playing the game.

Then I came to the dark side. I got a steam account and told the controller goodbye. And I haven't looked back.

So all cries about ayla rage being op (I don't think the move itself is

So here are a few tips I learned which most know or have heard

1. It is 3v3 not you vs them. 
You have two team mates for a reason. The game is balanced counting on the fact that you are a 1/3 piece of a unit. Especially if you are in a pug (pick up group) of random people you don't know...please stay together. Or at least communicate and work together.

2. Don't die. 
Dying is bad. Every death snowballs how bad it is. Obviously you feed the enemy money, if the enemy has a Leon and you hang out in the middle at low HP you might as well just type in all chat you want to fly down in the spaceship thingy again.

3. Adapt. You pick a naut and you pick a build. Great. You probably have an order in mind of what items you will buy. That's great and all but it is rare you can buy the exact items in the exact order every game. They have a gnaw/skoldir or someone has a dot (damage over time) move? Might want regen sooner. Damage is important

4. Kill all the droids.
Just chasing down and killing their droids is more useful and helpful than getting kills. You get money and you protect your turrets by doing so. The goal is to get past the turrets to kill the base. Not kill nauts. And killing all the droids makes it really hard to push. Just kill them it is that simple.

5. Awareness.
Always be looking at the minimap. Know where your allies are (even though they should be on screen mostly) know where the enemies are. Know where the closest creep or health pack is. Just know where everything is. At all times. Also when you have a quick second to check (for me usually when I go back to upgrade) check what the enemy is buying. Leon doesn't have stealth yet? Lonestar has life steal o mite? Good things to know.

6. Don't be a dick.
If you die, don't give up just cause they got a turret or two ahead. Comebacks happen a lot especially if they push too hard and get cocky. If your teammate sucks and is going 1/15 don't call him out in all chat. Try to be subtle in team chat like ""hey remember how you got raped 3v1 cause you keep running out alone over and over? Maybe try to stick closer to us"". We all have bad games, don't judge them or be a dick.

So thats all I can think of now. Any correction or add ons are welcome. Happy hunting.

My own: Playing public with 2 of my friends (Coco, and owned the jungle. It was a long gruelling game, chipping each other's turrets and not many kills. At the same time, there was a bit of friendly jibbing going on in the chat. We were both holding our back turrets and the game was pretty standstillish. Finally they took our back bottom turret, and the top one fell soon after. 

Instead of slowly chipping out our base, and only ayla lasted on their side. As she fled to the jungle to heal, I screamed PUSH and we all ran to their base. We killed it in what was probably one of the hypest things I've ever done in games.

**Froggy G**: Play him a little bit. A good Froggy can be annoying


**Lonestar**: If I want to push and make life difficult for the enemy

* Dynamite deals good consistent damage to turrets (especially if you buy the triple dynamite upgrade)

* Bull is great cc since if done right will push the enemy back into your team or tower and lead to their death. It also helps immensely with pushing or solo tower tanking in a way nobody else can compare with.


**Leon**: Play him occasionally. I can see why his tongue is an important ability to have in this game


**Clunk**: Has amazing health and burst potential and I try to exploit that as early as possible. However

* Bite -&gt; Explosion combined with Clunk's tankiness make him a real threat on the battlefield

* Genji is essentially a hardcounter to an explosion Clunk as he cannot detonate if cocooned


**Voltar**: Don't really play him. His healing has made for some scary pushes but I feel like Genji shuts down his primary benefactors too hard for him to be considered strong right now.


**Gnaw**: Pretty decent at playing defense

* Good defender since seedlings can help fortify turrets

* Good duelist since his spit DoT can melt people

* Good for setting traps with dropping spit and seedlings


**Coco**: Arguable who's better for poking between her and Rae. Ball Lightning doesn't force you to stay in place and can go through walls

* Her poke can become ridiculous

* Her slow/DoT allows her to dodge chasers and set up enemies to get mauled by the rest of her team.


**Skølldir**: I don't play him but man


**Yuri**: Yuri feels like a big offender of balance at the moment (at least at higher unlock levels). Mines can be a problem but the biggest problem with him is his slow field. Honestly the size upgrade makes it HUGE and impossible to escape from him. Add to that the upgrades that make his slow even worse to deal with (and a slow on his laser) and his teammates

* Mines are good for helping waveclear/area denial/setting up traps but **generally** require strategy in placement.

* As mentioned his slow field is ridiculous. Some teams will just find it impossible to deal with.


**Raelynn**: I like playing her, since her autos and slow field can deal ridiculous damage.

* +50 Solar on kill makes it really easy to snowball

* High damage long range nuke murders squishies

* Slow punishes enemy nauts who get caught in it heavily

* Good duelist with autoattacks


**Derpl**: I don't really play cat Derpl and haven't seen it yet so I don't know how good it is. However I know how good turret Derpl can be in the hands of a good player.

* Snare -&gt; Turret -&gt; Nuke combo can be very hard to deal with and will straight-up kill squishier nauts.

* Good Derpls will deploy on fall-through floors

* Very good pusher

**Vinnie and Spike**: He annoys me


**Genji**: Now I know how people feel about him

* Autoattack modifier that is really good at waveclear and zoning

* Excellent cc that neutralizes channels and Clunk's explosion; also packs more utility on top of that with team healing and %hp damage upgrades

* Monarch Blessing can help lots of incoming damage

There have been games where I am playing fine, with the ""Lost connection to host"" error popping up. The game even identifies me having disconnecting because of a random problem with my connection to the host, its not like my network connection was lost as if I unplugged my router or a cable. And then there are times when everyone in game has ping around 100 to me except for one person with 600 ping, and the game decides to migrate the host to him, making me disconnect seconds later. 

Being disconnected shouldnt count as a full loss, and making you lose some rating but not as ridiculous as a full loss. There have been countless games where my team has the advantage with little to no chance of losing, only to disconnect and lose a bunch of rating that you have to win 3 more matches to make up for.

**TLDR** Disconnects shouldnt count as a loss when most of the time it isnt the players fault



EDIT: Yes, etc... and the apparent inability to distinguish between an unplugged network cable with a host connection problem. Thing is though, to an extent, the game *can* distinguish. A network cable being unplugged will always cause a complete loss of internet connection, causing a ""Network connection"" error to be acknowledged by the game. However, a disconnection caused by ping or Host problems are different, the game acknowledges them as ""Lost connection to host"" errors, in which case this is time consuming

Matchmaking has literally ruined the game for me. I made time tonight to play with my brother and our good friend. Out of 5 games, had prestiged at least once per person (often several times). EDIT: We are all less than level 50, and around 20-30 hours played. Nowhere close to the same skill level.

We played 2 teams that had rank 1 players

This game just isn't fun anymore. We get matched against people way above our skill level. Even when we win

I'm a big Starcraft 2 player that has brilliant matchmaking. I'm used to losing (I do quite often in SC2)

Until something with matchmaking is revamped, it's the fact that I can't even compete. Winning or losing, there's no competition. Competition drives games.

Edit: I don't have a ""perfect"" solution for how matchmaking should work or what system would solve everything. But that's not my job. It's a broken system, but it's up to Romino to fix it. I would honestly wait 5 minutes for a good match instead of getting throw into and wasting 10-15 minutes in an un-winnable game. I don't even care about new characters or balance at this point. The very core of the game (how it pairs me with other players) is preventing me from having fun.",,False,self,t5_2tvrv,1370675975.0,,

They will just stand there and stare at it but never deny the other team the invis if they have the chance unless they happen to run into it. Major disadvantage in matches with bots on that level right now.

- Bots on your own team will jump on the worm button intentionally to kill you. Literally they will run over it

- Bots will occasionally just hop around doing plyometrics in your team base during matches. *I have only had this experience once with a Froggy bot on Aguillon and have not yet seen it recreated

- Raelynn Time Rift does no damage to weedlings. This has been mentioned in other posts. I have seen it myself a couple of times last night.

- Occasionally get stuck on character selection screen after selecting a character.

- Occasionally stuck in Initializing Game screen.

- Genji will occasionally deal random damage from butterfly shot misses . I don't know what this was. There was a Genji firing butterfly shots upward from the nest in the top half of Ribbit in anticipation of bots. I was up at the very top of the map (as Vinnie) and then moved behind my turret to grab health/solar

- Invis to invis occasionally gets a bit crazy on Aguillon. If you are invis with Vinnie's smoke screen and grab the orb, just a guessing game really.

- Nauts occasionally showing empty HP bars and refusing to die. One post showing Derpl currently with empty bar. Played one match against a Froggy who just refused to die with 0 HP showing as well. HP visibility fix?

- Via [Gregar's comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/Awesomenauts/comments/1e2dbf/let_us_compile_a_list_of_the_bugsbot_ai_issues_we/c9w48lh) bots, and firing at them, they will just stand there and tank damage for awhile without moving. You can pretty easily get a few standard weapon shots off and then one of your larger powered skills off before he will recognize anything is actually happening and attack or retreat.

1376326526.0,1k7snf,Tips and the general metagame of Awesomenauts.,mikluap,18,3,20,"**Metagame**

The meta has slight variations depending on builds, but this is just the general meta. There are exceptions, but again, this is generalized advice. 

1. Stay with your allies almost ALWAYS. Exceptions are late game when someone has to backdoor, but do so being very attentive to the minimap. 

2. Do not overextend. More times than not

3. Push whenever you get the chance. If an enemy is killed

4. Only go back to base when your team can afford to have people go back. It's usually better to stay out longer with slightly weaker upgrades than to go back every time you can afford to buy something else. I usually go back with an average of 400 solar. It's only good to go back with barely enough solar to buy when you have a clear advantage

(A good Clunk will almost never go back to base for health, and neutral critters to stay out for as long as he likes.)


**Tips**

1. If your turret is being attacked with droids and enemy nauts, if they have low health, if you or an ally can snare/trap them for a gank)

2. When you are defending a turret that's about to be destroyed, Raelynn, Froggy, Skolldir, or just about anyone can get a kill very quickly as soon as the turret drops. So assume that they will use their skills (dash, dive, snipe, if you're attacking a turret that's on the brink of getting destroyed

3. If your turret is going to go down, or yourself. The enemy team still gets solar though but doesn't give them as much.""- tojnagag

As far as my build goes I go:


* Droids: Four

* Bot: Longevity

* Auto: Heal more

* Body: Boots




I opted out of the money on heal because I wanted to double my heal on my auto to counter the fact that I'm not taking heal boost on bot. The build is meant to be more of a poke/push thing to help my team win team fights and snipe people when the least expect it diving us. 


Are any of these useless? It's too soon for me to tell since I just started with this guy. 


I typically start Solar Tree and go into Healbot, picking up health and speed where needed. I usually max auto attack heals last unless there is a gnaw heavy on spit or something. I've been thinking about replacing Medi-Can with pills and try for tanky push/heal kind of thing.

**Intro**

I haven't seen any good froggy threads yet so I decided to make one myself.


1.15 brought everyone a lot of changes


**Classic 1.14 Froggy**


The classic build very much focused on early triangle dashes

A lot of builds looked something like this:

&gt; Ice Cubes / Hammer Pants / Hydro Smash

&gt; Boombox or Turbo Tape / Twisted Tweeters / RBay

&gt; Piranha Cartridges / Mutant Worms / Thorn Fish or Range

&gt; Power Pills Light / Power Pills / Piggy Bank


The build order would be as followed:

Mandatory:

&gt; Power Pills -&gt; Splash Dash -&gt; Tornado -&gt; Hammer Pants -&gt; Ice Cubes -&gt; Twister Tweeters ; 1110 solar

Possible follow ups:

&gt; Thornfish -&gt; Mutant Worms -&gt; Piranha Cartridges ; 1070 solar 

&gt; Boom Box / RBay ; 630 solar

&gt; Boots


This is pretty straight forward and I don't expect too many questing about this. I would just like request that everyone who is about to propose one of those silly glass canon



**Patch notes 1.15**


*Dash*

- Base stun duration 0.5 -&gt; 0.7

- Ice Cubes stun duration +0.5 -&gt; +0.4

- Ice Cubes cost 160-&gt; 175

- Hydro splash cost 140 -&gt; 120

- Hydro Smash cost 320 -&gt; 280

- Clock Necklace cost 190 -&gt; 200

- Golden watch cost 120 -&gt; 110

- Hammer Pants split into two stages giving +12 damage


Stun duration got changed to a higher base and a lower upgrade. The changes are in the 0.1-0.2 second range so don't notice them a whole lot. I haven't yet figured out how the froggy self stun gets affected due to the default and changed times being so god damn short 


In the end it's the same duration though


The Hydro price reduction are welcome


Clock price changes are really minor and why would you even run clocks? Solar is better spend somewhere more useful.


Hammer pants got a stage and price increase


The summary of these changes for the classic dash build


*Tornado Move*

- Right Back at Ya cost 290 -&gt; 300

- Can't touch this shield +40 -&gt; +60

- Twister Tweeters deal 50% damage vs. turrets


RBay got a 10 solar price increase

CTT

Turret damage was never the main focus for your TT

The summary of these changes for the classic dash build


*Fish Gun*

- Viridian Eel Cartridges cost 225 -&gt; 140

- Change Mutant Worms: Ninja Edition, cost 110 -&gt; 190

Viridian Eel Cartridges

Ninja Worms

The new ninja worms open up a lot of new possibilities. 190 solar solar for in theory 30 damage

The classic build is unaffected by these changes.

Yes it is really great 


*General*

- Power pills lite health 30 -&gt; 25

Pills... Make up your mind Ronma! 

Changes

Pills is always going to be mandatory for every naut and every build (but but pilless... Yes

**Summary**

Classic froggy got a lot of really small hits

There is a total 60 solar increase for you're ealy game items as well as an aditional 200 solar increase for mandatory pills. And 10 for Rbay.

Tweeter turret damage



This might not seem as a whole lot

That makes these changes have a higher impact than they seem to at first glance.

Now let's see how we can take advantage of the changes classic froggy doesn't use and take a look at my solution for these issues.




**New 1.15 Froggy**

This bit is going to be my solution for 1.15

I concluded that classic Froggy took a early game blow

My solution for this resolves around the new Ninja worms


*The new loadout*

&gt; Hydro splash / Ice cubes / Hydro Smash

&gt; Turbo Tape / Tisted Tweeters / RBay

&gt; Piranha Cartridges / Ninja worms / Thornfish

&gt; Power Pills Light / Med-i'-can / Power Pills


The build order would be as followed:

Mandatory:

 &gt;Power Pills -&gt; Splash Dash -&gt; Tornado -&gt; Ninja Worms -&gt; med-i'-can -&gt; Turbo Tape (1 rank) -&gt; Twister Tweeters ; 1140 solar

Possible follow ups:

&gt; Ice Cubes ; 350 solar

&gt; Thornfish -&gt; Piranha Cartridges ; 740 solar 

&gt; RBay ; 300 solar

&gt; Pill Light ; 450 solar

&gt; Hydro Smash -&gt; Hydro Splash ; 640 solar


Some things of you might notice right away is the absence of hammer pants
You won't miss any of the three much though and the reason for it is one simple 190 solar upgrade


You start off as you always have, collect some solar then go back for tornado early or save up 325 solar for both tornado and ninja worms and then go back.

After you build into ninja worms you're first change from classic froggy starts. While classic froggy would have triangle dashes

You can dow perfectly dash a mid air Yuri, this will result in 46 damage, only 6 less than the classic hammer pant triangle. While having the bonus of 0.2s aditional stun and more possible angles.

Pop you're tornado afterwards

Even if you get only one tornado tick off this combo will do 83 damage


After this startup build lets find upgrades that synergyse well with the ninja worms. For now I found two contestors that work really well

Turbo Tape,8 seconds of stun. Tape allows you to make up for this lost time by still allowing you to get you're tornado hits in on a running enemy.

The absence of cubes means you will get poked a bit more
Light Pills while better than regen are just to expensive at the start.


After this I go for a combination of Ice cubes / health pills / Twisted Tweeters. I favor Tweeters since it works great with the Tape you already bought. You will need to priorities health if you're struggling or Cubes if you're team benefits more from it.

Build thornfish and piranha when you feel you can. The reason why I take piranha over mutant worms is that it will synergise better with your ninja shot. And you can still click shoot while chasing for maximum speed.

Buy RBay when you feel it's needed just like before.

My switch to full hydro is still a bit untested

The one time I upgrades them was versus a Yuri and Vinny and it felt great. Yet like the old hydro smash


The only down side I see to Ninja worms until now is that it requires a lot more twitch skill




**Conclusion / TL;DR**

It is funny how very subtle changes and one new skill make my play style take a 180. Instead of a triangle dash into tornado Froggy I now play something I would like to call a hit'n chase froggy.
During the beta I only found out the patch it's effect on the classic frog




**Footage**

I streamed a lot of footage about this build the past weekend

I want to start a discussion on the meta as it relates to leagues and how it changes as you go up the skill curve.

I believe real teamwork and skill is when, not necessarily kill). And another level of skill exists in the ability to get and maintain a level advantage to give you an edge in those otherwise balanced fights.

I see a transition at around leauge 4/3 where the game goes from focusing on kills, of which I'm less familiar than I would like ;)

I had a hard time convincing someone, we lost because they couldn't push and had only killed about 10 creeps (including health creeps).

So if anyone's interested, peoples objectives and playstyles and how they change moving up the leagues.

As a clunk it is tough especially with upgraded diameter and situations of offense can quickly turn to defense if I am right next to Yuri and he activates the field. 

It becomes pretty much impossible to get out of the field especially if he has slow on the beam which usually doesn't kill on its own but hurts a lot. He can just get out of range of explode no problem because it extends detonation time when slow field activated. Usually at that time it is time for clunk to retreat because a lot like coitus once clunk does his romance explosion

Add other enemy Awesomebros in the mix and it is deadly. Even worse add an Awesomebro with snare or stun and life gets about as tough as a neck beard complaining on the internet. Obviously Allies are important to lean on but I was wondering for a lone wolf scenario to get away?

I implore you, ( lolz YOU SUCK NOOB) but at least once a day, I get angry and think to myself "" I sure wish so and so would just quit so I could have a chance at winning"".

I don't think many people use these because I rarely see it but here are a few fun and powerful builds with some characters I've been messing around with.

Note: mostly for high level people

Lonestar: 

* [eagal bullets + tiger bullets + Crystal bullets = Fast speed at 13 damage per shot.](http://puu.sh/XuBz)

Derpl zork: 

* [Catsuit + ranged cat skill + bat catsuit = 20 damage per shot with long range.](http://puu.sh/XuFQ)

* [ Catsuit (or bat catsuit) + lots of cats + ranged skill (or the other catsuit passive) = 13 long ranged fast damage (faster than lonestars max speed blaster) or 20 short ranged fast damage.](http://puu.sh/XuDW)

* [Turret range + shield + other shield upgrade = massive protection for base defense.](http://puu.sh/XuG3)

clunk: 

* [Missile upgrade + juggernaut (I think that's what it's called) + Missile barrage = 14, 62 damage. About 156 damage per missile string.](http://puu.sh/XuCO) 

* I just fell in love with this combo [Bite damage + Extra HP on bit + Bite Damage Bulk buy = 54 damage and health on bite. I played a match with this and we won against a clunk and high-powered voltar

* Quick n' cleaner (bite upgrade) + Power converter + The suckanator power 9000 cleaner (high level bite upgrade) = +88 Hp per bit dealing 44 damage. 

* Quick n' cleaner (or Suckanator power 9000 cleaner) + multi-hose + power converter = +128 HP per bite if you hit 2 targets

Yuri: 

* [Time warp heal + fast forward + heal pod delux = 24 health per second.](http://puu.sh/XuIV)

* [Range + crystal + Hubble lense = far damage of up to 9 per hit.](http://puu.sh/XuID)

* [Mine damage + cool down (or carpet bomb if you want to be a pain) + uranium spikes = 78 damage per mine (too lazy to divide by 3 for carpet bomb)](http://puu.sh/XuJ7) (sorry for this one

Froggy G:

* Golden Watch + Ice cubes + Golden Necklace =  2-3 second cool down for quick getaways

* (Previous combo above with the following whirlpool build) Fast forward + Bio fuel cell + Twister Tweeters = Extremly quick

That's all I've gone with and all except for the Yuri beam build worked wonders.

Edit: few more tips.

With some builds you have to skip out on some abilities. With Lonestar I avoid the TNT and only get the bull

1345127732.0,ybl52,The Ultimate Tactic - Hyperpush,krucifyd,11,0,8,"Hi there! I'm Teelap. Currently

Currently, yet is rediculously fun! However, There is a tactic I have developed that is a true monster. I call it hyperpush. 

The best part about Hyperpush is that you can do it entirely yourself. So far

Pick Voltar

Abilities: # of drones, improved heal, CD; Range, 10% solar/Heal, +4 heal; +30 solar/min, +150 solar, Free health.

The goal of this build is to win the game under ten minutes. When you land (if you caught enough solar) you can get all 3 bottom teir abilities and both of your regular abilities. get out to lane and heal away. When you have enough, get the health bot upgrades.

Usually, run into the enemy tower and take aggro. Then, drop your healbot and heal the fuck out of it. This will not only top off your minions, but it will also stop the enemy from effectively harassing your minions. Every time your drones are off CD use them. the explosions help push tower and with the CD upgrades they are a very effective weapon when being attacked (froggy G dashes thru them all the time and kills himself instantly). If you can keep up the pressure, you win. Never back off. In the 2 games i lost, my team backed off to secure the ""bonus"" towers. 

There is only one person that can threaten this tactic: CoCo. If I had 100 karma every time i say ""fucking goddamn COCO"" i would be the bill gates of reddit. Her ball is super effective against voltar. However i learned a trick to deal with her: Dodge the ball. It sound easy, his W ability. You can jump at max height and hover over the range of the ball.

Whelp, or derpl on your side, the game is an instant GG. If you wanna play and climb the board a bit, I am ""krucifyd"" on steam. ",,False,self,False,t3_ybl52

In my loadout

**BITE**

* Increased Bite damage and lifesteal
* Gain extra max HP when you lethally bite an enemy
* Ensnare an enemy when you bite them

**Self-Destruct**

* Increased Self-Destruct Dammage
* Slow enemies in the AOE while charging Self-Destruct
* Decreased Self-Destruct cooldown
(There is really no need to decrease the amount of dammage self-destruct does to you. It doesn't do much to begin with

**Missiles**

* Increased firing speed
* Add an improved missile to his stream
* ???? (I'll edit this when I get home

**Stats**

* Increased Max HP
* Increased Movement speed
* Gain 125 Solar

The 125 Solar gain will probably be replaced with the other Increase Max HP skill when I unlock it. For now


Start by collecting as much Solar as you can on the launch. On your first buy, and Bite. By the time you get to your lane, you should be level 3 against level 1 or 2 champs. The level advantage combined bite allows you to trade blows positively, giving you the upper hand in the first laning phase. Anyone who tries to be aggressive on you loses over half of their health. If you need to jungle, he can one shot all of the neutral creeps without an upgrade, giving you a distinct advantage in farm, as well as denying the other team any heals.

On my first buy, and increased max HP when you kill an enemy with bite. If you have enough Solar, increase your Max HP stat as well. (with the sustain from Bite and neutral camps, I might not go back until I have 700-1000 solar) 

When you are farming your max HP with bite, you have enough HP that you should never die, making sure you are the biggest and baddest tank in the game.

Your second buy should be all about increasing damage on your skills and becoming more tanky. If the other team is using heavy nukers, or an enemy Clunk, max out your bonus HP before increasing damage on his skills. Here is why: against sustained damage enemies, Clunk can hang out all day. But burst damage can get the best of him, because you won't have the time to get more than one bite off. After taking a few heavy nukes, running away is difficult because you are probably the slowest champ in the game. Having all 3 points in Max HP will help remedy this. Even still, be weary of heavy nukes. 

If the other team is using auto attacks, that is personal preference. The bonus HP from farming with bite should be enough to tank these champs, but if not, go ahead and get a point or two in maxing your HP.
___________________________________________________________
**Your Role**

After your first buy, there is no ""if"" =P )In fights, if you need to keep someone from running away, charge self-destruct, and then bite them right after it goes off. This will regen the HP you just spend to slow them and take out almost all of their health. In a 1v1 fight, feel free to bait them a little, then bite them. They will probably try to run now. Try to get another bite in before using self-destruct. If they are below 50% though, keep them in the damage aura

I didn't talk about missiles, I focus on tanking and nuking the other team. Sure, I shoot missiles, but they are not the source of damage in this build. The way I see it, you have a ton of HP. You are better off running into the enemy team and nuking them. If you are standing back shooting missiles, you better have a good reason. I have yet to have a game go long enough that I needed to upgrade my missiles. I go for all of the other upgrades first.

This is my first concept of a guide

I've been playing Awesomenauts for some months now (Steam's stating 100 hrs) and I wanna give you some insight on Lonestar - he's the only Naut I'm playing right now. I see many people struggling with Lonestar

In my opinion

**Upgrades we choose beforehand:**
**TNT:** Triple TNT
**Bull:** +Health/Pushback, its the last upgrade I get normally)
**Pistol:** +2 DMG/+4 DMG/AoE Bullets
**Basic:** Boots/Piggy Bank/Free Health

When the game starts
**TNT

This gives us great poking and pushing power. Gives us great defence too.

Make sure you get lots of creep kills, go back.

If you reach 220 or even 440 before you have to go back the first time

Once you take down the first/or both middle towers

Get **TNT Bounce** next (or before boots

For the endgame you will need good Auto Attacks. Get **DMG, probably). Keep pushing, pushing, pushing and again - don't take too many risks.

**Talking about matchups:**

**Froggy:** You can't kill a good Froggy

**Lonestar:** Just be the better Lonestar. Push more

**Leon:** Have your TNT ready. When he pulls you

**Clunk:** Space him well (you can even walk back and shoot him with Auto Attack). He has a big hitbox and no Range. Just keep him out.

**Yuri:** Your bull can clear mines. Will greatly decrease your pushing power

**Voltar:** You destroy Voltar. You one-hit creep waves and push his healbot away. You can also counter the ""Voltar-Train"" very well.

**Coco (Range):** She's a pain. You are the slowest Naut in game without boots. You can't really poke her well and she pushes the Creeps almost as good as you. Just keep pushing and jump the ganktrain

**Coco (Melee):** Don't fight with her. If you land Triple TNT

**Derpl:** A very good matchup. Exploding Bull + TNT is very annoying for Derpl - even regenerating or with Voltar in the back. 

**Gnaw:** Is annoying

**Skolldir:** Hard matchup. You can't space him well because of his long range stun fist and throw (will be your despair actually). Play safe and throw lots of bulls into him.

**Raelynn:** You excel better than her in the pushing and fleeing department (thanks to the Bull). Once you got the Life Leech upgrade on your nades

**Vinnie:** Vinnie doesn't like you

**Tips &amp; Tricks:**

**TK Bull (Tiger Knee Bull):** Tiger Knee is a fighting game term

**Pin with the Bull/use your tower:** Drop down and throw an air bull

**Bull DON'Ts:** Don't save your enemies with the bull (thrown

**Triple Jump into Jungle on Sorona**: You can descent from the platform above the jump pad between the towers

**Don't die! (REALLY

So I stuck with my Yuri main, since outhealing the enemy is pretty potent unless they can isolate us. A third steam friend joins us, and we work him into our team comp.

Now I had faced a few Aylas solo

Why?

Because as we roll along, here comes an Ayla. I'm not too scared, we could easily heal the damage she does, and we'll kill her before she drains us too much.

Wrong.

All she does is cover us with rage. And she goes from half HP to full in about a second and a half. Three enemy players, when she came in, we had to scatter. Then she'd just settle for one or two of us instead.

I understand that Ronimo were probably looking for counters to Team Nerf Plz after their APL steamroll

Thing is, you're not going to kill her. She leaches life too fast and does too much damage for that. And forget running if you've got any considerable distance to cover before getting to safety, she's too fast for most nauts to handle.

Granted, by greatly extending the amount of time she can spend in rage without ever hitting anything. She enters the fight, stays, and leaves as she pleases. And the more enemies there are in that location, the better.

My observation is pretty simple: Awesomenauts has always rewarded good teamwork by allowing a team that's disciplined enough to stay together to overcome a stray nauts by sheer strength in numbers. This one new character changes all that. You can't do that anymore with her in the game. Your lone hope is to poke at her with range, Lonestar, and the other ranged pokers have to peek out from around cover and take their shots where they can, ready to duck their heads back in at a moments notice. Brawlers have no chance. Yuri might get a mine kill if he takes advantage of her momentum and times it just right. but if that mine doesn't kill her, three more seconds of cooldown is all she needs to burn your HP bar down to zero.

What gives? Is there some secret formula we're missing here? Also everyone on the forums seems to think Ayla is ""the most balanced new naut yet"" which we find ridiculous.

1351813789.0,12hipw,Quick overview of the new naut',thatdovahkiinyouknow,10,2,7,"top edit: screw it

First off, the dialogue and passives are full of references like ""you feeling lucky punk"", ""I'm firin my lazer"" (or chargin either one), and ""Say hello to my little friend"". Going based on this person alone I can't wait to see what ronimo will do the the next naut.

First

The snipe is really good (to some degree OP near end game) and fun to use but here is how it works: you press the button and your character pulls out a spartan laser and ***can't move, normally you hear the beep and it fires half a second later. Once fired you will see a picture of a cross-hair with the word hit next to it to show you hit something just in case you are playing on a small resolution or monitor. ***It can't go through or damage turrets either.***

The time warp (which I deem as completely OP once upgraded) is a small field that can be placed down to ***slow enemies by*** a lot

Like some characters she also has a ***special speed boot passive*** which not only increases speed but ***if you don't shoot*** (doesn't matter if you're under attack) ***you gain even more speed*** and enter a sprinting stance which can be shown with particles entering your character and a line of arrows facing the direction you are facing above your head.

My current build can be started from the very start of the game and can greatly effect your end game passives.

For the bottom row I have Health

For the middle row I have piercing

On the 2^nd to top row for sniper I get damage

On to top row I choose Adding damage to the time field

With this build you can easily get money just by standing behind your turret and sniping things, a leon, a froggy G, and 5 droids coming down in 1 straight path.

That's all I have on the new naut' so far

Let me start by saying my main nauts are Leon and Derpl with bit of Gnaw and Yuri on the side. I'm going to tell you guys how I build them and I'd love some criticism.

With leon, tongue range, stealth, crit, health, movement as my base upgrades. In mid game, I focus on attackspeed, and first strike dmg. and finally for late game I get the clone attack and explode for pushing.

I play leon as a straight up assassin. stealth behind people and stick to them dishing out as much dmg as possible. or I might tongue people into my team/turret and then follow them. i feel like I dont farm enough on him because I focus on killing enemies too much

With Derpl, turret, turret range, turret stun, nuke, health as my core. I then go into mid game with turret damage, and nuke upgrades. At the very end

With Derpl, and nuke, but I am usually overextended because I push too hard and go 1v3 and die.

Like I said

Now for the questions.

* 1. How hard/realistic is it for me to try to get to league 1? 
* 2. Is it worth it to prestige? I""m just about to hit max level.
* 3. It is good to suicide to push turrets?
* 4. Is there anyway to see my total W/L?
* 5. What are considered the OP/UP champs by most?
* 6. How often do they patch/add new nauts? 
* 6b. When do you guys think the new naut will be released.
* 7. How much rating do you get for winning/losing/d-cing?
* 8. Not much of a question,False,self,t5_2tvrv,False,,,t3_1496ms

So it drives me up the wall that the only option I have is to play against the same team of dudes that whipped my ass last time.  I can't quit and join another game, because I'm not getting matched up against people at my skill level, I'm getting matched up with people that are ending the game about 10 levels higher than I am.  

Fine, I'm not good, but the game isn't teaching me how to get better, and it's not giving me the option to play against people that are as bad as I am.  I'm presented with the monumental task of doing hours of research outside the game just so that I have a chance to enjoy Awesomenauts, because I can promise you that failing against the same team over and over again isn't going to bring new players, like me, into this genre.  

Maybe I've missed the point.  Maybe this game doesn't want me around.

When we hit ready, or at least rematch team, but we always play games through so we decided to get what we could out of it.

I went Skolldir (yes, my roommate went Raelynn, and our third teammate was apparently a Coco, I think.  We were matched against Gnaw, Coco, and Vinnie.  The map was AIS 404.

Early on, patrolling the jungle frequently, and dual-bursting anyone they came across), and several other people joined and raged as soon as they got beaten once.  The enemy team wasn't pushing very hard, but Gnaw had +seedlings and fertilizer, and had set up a full suite of seedlings right in front of their one turret.  I didn't go for gnome right away so I didn't have a lot of AoE, so for quite a while that turrret was impenetrable, and while we were able to mostly keep them back from our turret

They kept pushing and we had some great fights in the mid area where the lanes split; I kept going around the bottom and tossing Coco or Gnaw into our turret

Then we got a teammate who didn't leave; he was playing Lonestar, Rae and I were able to drop from the jungle and completely clear out the weedling nest with earthquake + snipe + gnome + some more auto-attacking (nerf Gnaw plx) and get in a light push on their turret.  They pushed us back and took our second turret, so they were in our base with their front turret still over 50%.

I didn't notice when it happened but they lost their Vinnie somewhere between our first and second turrets going down.  We pushed successfully and they stopped hitting our base to defend their turret.  They lost their Coco around when their turret went down, the jungle, the middle area, and our base.  Gnaw was an obnoxious bitch, like Gnaw is, but by sticking with Rae we were able to pretty solidly brutalize him with snare + slow + bronze + snipe.  Once Rae's time warp was fully upgraded they stopped being able to get into our base.

I expected a base race once we got their top turret, but with the exception of a Clunk who stuck around for a while, they were squishy enough that we could burst them down pretty easily.  And Clunk was slow enough that we could toss, CC, slow, and burst him down before he could escape the time warp.  Gnaw had some seedlings on the turret which were annoying, but we were able to hunt him down and kill him.

The game was about 28 minutes, but we managed to go from a situation we thought was certain defeat to a fairly broad win.  Props to the Gnaw who stuck around even when both of his teammates either raged or d/c'ed, and who kept harassing us for the entire half hour.

Lonestar: can win games on his own by pushing so hard that he might shit himself during the process.

Raelynn: really powerful pusher too

Vinnie: due to him being really weak early game he is just on the good list

Clunk: after they fix his medical pump he belongs on the Best

Leon: he is just good he can get many kills but if the other team sticks together he can't do much.

Skolldir: His throw in combination with his stunning and dot damage makes him really annoying to deal with. 

---Okay:
Coco: her ball ability seems to work very well in laggy games but if it is not laggy she shouldn't get many kills

Yuri: You gotta be really lame to play Yuri well and you are often times dependant on your opponents being bad or falling for your trap. Good players don't fall for his traps he is often times doing his thing while it is 3 vs his other 2 allies.

Gnaw: Overpowered on Ribbit

But, Clover of Honor does damage to turrets, but it is not full damage. I did not upgrade my basic attack, but I did upgrade the Clover of Honor all the way, making it do +12 damage on my third strike. Dummies have been nerfed so they do half damage against EVERYTHING now.

The Clover of Honor does 6 damage on the dummies against turrets and the base. On Leon himself, which is 3 more than usual. Keep in mind it does 20 against people.

Also, similar to Raelynn's HC Bomb.

Now

Leon's dummies with explosion on them does 1/5 of the damage to turrets and the base. They really hate Explosion spam, which makes Clover + Battery Pack the only effective setup to use on the Dummies. Backstab on Dummies is very ineffective, seeing as how they cannot jump behind people, and if they do get behind someone, it is a very rare once-in-a-game occurrence.

Dummies are not for killing people. They are for distracting. They are for annoying. They are for tanking. Explosion is good against infantry, but the Battery Pack allows for tanking ability and more hits if you are following behind it.

But i will change that a bit. Now

it's gonna be hard and it would be awesome if you can join us!

**Where to meetup:**

The entire thing will be streamed. It will be at:

www.twitch.tv/wawasc

We can use the stream chat to set up matches

I am aware that there is a mumble server for us but i don't know how to use that. :(

if you do. im sure tons are over there all the time playing this game so finding a private match would be easy. 
We will start around 6pm EST - 10pm EST **/** 3pm PST - 7pm PST.


**What can this do to us and the community:**

- forming a possible solid team
- maybe a  tourney (?) ;)
- have fun
- fun
- having fun

I hope to see a lot join in!

Thank you!

Just picked up the game yesterday. At first i was getting hammered (as to be expected). I realised that a big part of the reason this was happening was because I was much lower level than my enemies.

Coming from a LoL background

So my question is.... Is there any way to know how much XP your character has in game? I couldn't see an XP bar anywhere. Does anyone know the actual numbers that creeps and minions give when killed?

TL;DR
1. Is there a way to see how much XP your character has in game?
2. Is it worth killing neutral creeps for XP?
3. What tactics do you employ when your behind in level?",self,t5_2tvrv,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/Awesomenauts/comments/z05lz/basics_in_game_character_level_experience/

I keep seeing people recommend Solar Tree but I'm not sure whether it's because they haven't done the math or if there's something I'm missing.

Solar Tree costs 125 solar and gives 30 solar/minute. It pays for itself after basically 4 minutes. Piggy Bank gives a flat 150 solar. If you take ST instead of PB then you need to make up 275 solar with ST before it starts making profit. This takes about 9 minutes

The only two times I could imagine taking ST are if you are confident you can drag a game out to 20+ minutes or if you are playing an expensive character who needs the solar more than movement speed or extra health. I suppose if you're playing a character who can't farm or kill effectively (coco?) then ST might be worth grabbing
