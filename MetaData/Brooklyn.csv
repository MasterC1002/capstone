As I approached, which instantly raised my suspicions. Then, across the street, I saw two more guys, one wearing a face mask. I realized, then, what was about to happen.

I quickened my pace,"" he said, motioning with his hand in his coat pocket, ""I've got a gun.""

""No you don't, but before I could continue, his friend ran up with the cane and started swinging. I tried to block/grab the cane and ended up throwing/falling with him into a car. ""FUCK YOU!"" I yelled. My strategy was to make as much noise as possible and fight them off long enough that they'd have to flee without getting my stuff. This was difficult, as the two guys from across the street had crossed over, and now I was trying to block the cane without leaving myself vulnerable to the other three.

We grappled on the sidewalk for a second, and I went deaf for a second. I was still resisting, but when my hearing came back I heard Cane-o say, ""Yo, this guy wants me to hit him AGAIN!"" He said it in a shocked tone, as if there was something perplexing about this. I wondered what he knew that I didn't, and sure enough, I felt blood running down my forehead. Like

I backed into a corner and the others swarmed me and ran my pockets. They pulled out my wallet, using my body in the corner to block. They were fast and nervous, and after a couple seconds they gave up and ran. Cane-o looked at me, muttered ""Shit"" and took off after them.

I went inside and washed the blood off. I saw several lacerations to the top of my head. The NYPD knocked on my door a minute later and said they had received calls from neighbors in several buildings. They took my statement while an ambulance treated my wound and suggested I go to the ER. I took a cab over to 7th Ave ($7 vs. god-knows-what ambulances charge) and received a single staple to hold the wound together.

All told, it's kind of amazing that this never happened before. I still love my neighborhood and my block (though I wish it was closer to the train solely for ambulatory reasons). If anyone in the neighborhood feels threatened by a situation ahead of them, though, I suggest turning around and calling a cab. It probably would have saved me a trip to the ER.

Many thanks to my neighbors who called the police. It's truly appreciated.

To my knowledge the only ticketed offense that was actively enforced until recently was biking on the sidewalk. 

I have been hearing from multiple other people I know that have also been getting ticketed lately so I just wanted to give you guys a heads up. NYPD has a quota to make and they're looking for reasons to pull over cyclist.

The revelation of the NSA's PRISM surveillance software is just the latest blow from the Federal Government in the continual attack on our civil liberties. 

We are supposed to be free from fear of illegal search and seizure without a warrant derived from probable cause. From DUI checkpoints, the 4th Amendment has been trampled time and time again. Well, the news about phone monitoring and PRISM is the anchor which broke the camel's back. 

Some of us are just plain old fed up and we are going to let our displeasures be known. Please join us as we try to educate, and exercise our right and obligation to peacefully protest an ever reaching government which is intent on maintining the status quo of control. 

Our first meeting is Weds night at 8 pm in Washington Sq Park, informing, dyving up tasks and more.  Please join us as we take our inalienable rights back.

Looking forward to meeting you.

The Park Slope Armory shelter (361 15th Street, you may be turned away, so be prepared for that.

The John Jay High School shelter (237 7th Avenue, and overnight volunteers this weekend (especially, but not only, people with medical training). You need to be able to dedicate at least 6-8 hours and cannot bring your children.

There is still a huge need for your help in Red Hook (and thank you to everyone who has already volunteered). Here are several opportunities over the weekend:

I am very happy to report that the Office of Emergency Management has set up an office in Red Hook at 402 Van Brunt Street. At 10 AM on Saturday, and be prepared to get a little dirty.

Added Value, cooked food to the farm at 1 PM on Saturday. Also, their computers were destroyed by Sandy and the farm would really appreciate a donation of an old computer or smart phone.

Red Hook Initiative has been doing amazing work this week on behalf of this community in need. They would still appreciate volunteers (at 767 Hicks Street) and donations of flashlights

Speaking of RR

I'm in the process of looking for a June 1 move-in date in the Greenpoint/Williamsburg/E Williamsburg area

**EDIT: Updating with some of the good info for those too lazy to read all the comments:**

* It is absolutely possible to find a place without a broker fee. Scour the by-owner section of craigslist and be ready to jump at a moment's notice. In the two days since this post
* Redditors have had bad experiences with: Rapid Realty, RS Bracha, Homewood Gardens, and Triumph Property Group
* 95% of apartments are open listings. That means anyone with a real-estate license can show the place. If a broker asks for more than one-month fee for a place and you haven't signed anything, 12, or 15% fees should only apply to exclusive listings (the other 5% of places)
* Many people suggest walking the streets of the neighborhood you want to be in and looking for ""for rent"" signs,,False,self,t5_2qme3,1367600412.0,,True

""By failing to prepare you are preparing to fail.""— Benjamin Franklin




//////// FACTS ABOUT IRENE //////////

• Caused $15 billion dollars in damage

• Killed 47 people in the USA




///////// FACTS ABOUT SANDY ///////////

• Sandy's Current death toll is at 48

• On Saturday

• Upon landfall, Sandy will still be strengthening.

• As a result of Sandy’s tremendous size and strength
 


//////////// PREPARATION //////////////

Stay indoors during the hurricane and away from windows and glass doors
Keep all your electronics charged and plugged in. (cell phones, tablet ..etc)

Turn down the temperature on your freezer and refrigerator as low as possible. 

This will buy you more time in the event of a power loss. 24 to 48 hours before will cool the food. Avoid opening them whenever possible. If you are evacuating

Download an application to your smartphone that can notify people where you are
If you have a generator

Keep away from loose or dangling power lines and report them immediately to the power company.

Make sure your car has fuel.

Stay off roads as much as possible

Copies of your important documents in a waterproof and portable container (insurance cards

A list of medications you take
Doctors’ names and phone numbers

Use flashlights instead of candles

Whistle

It may sound strange, and take a shower. Why? Because if you lose power, having as much clean as possible will make a big difference.

Avoid using the phone except for serious emergencies.

Know your surroundings and whether your home is in a flood prone area.

Determine where you would go — and how you would get there — if you were ordered to evacuate

Listen to the radio or TV for information

Secure your home

Huge items must even be secured in big storms. An engine block was found 40 or 50 feet up in a pine tree in the Homestead area after Andrew. Don't think that something is too big to be moved by the wind.

Have enough food that you can eat without cooking (because you may lose power) for 4-5 days suggested items including: canned meats, canned juice, peanut butter, jelly, salt-free crackers, energy/protein bars, trail mix/nuts, cookies or other comfort food.

Make extra ice

Have enough water for 4-5 days

Ensure a supply of water for sanitary purpose such as cleaning and flushing toilets. Fill the bathtub and other larger containers with water

Know power safety - avoid downed lines

Know food safety - what is good and for how long.

Water treatment - whether water needs to be boiled or not.

Avoid drinking or preparing food with tap water until you are sure it's not contaminated.

Check refrigerated food for spoilage. If in doubt

Have a plan. Discuss possible hazards and procedures with your family

Have extra cash on hand

Regardless of whether or not you are in an evacuation zone



/////////// IF EVACUATING ////////////////////

Before you evacuate

Leave a note to say where you are going.

Unplug small appliances and electronics before you leave.

Checkbooks

Driver's license

Credit card information

Birth certificates

Social Security cards

Child care

So now I am looking to expand into more neighborhoods like Bushwick, Ft. Greene etc. The best suggestion I got was to find pick-up spots in each neighborhood. Businesses that would be cool and let me drop a milk crate of jars once a week there for my customers to pick up during a certain window of time in return for free soup and hopefully making my customers into their customers. 

So what I am looking for help with is names of cool shops

tl;dl : Share a trip to Costco

EDIT1: Awesome to hear from you all! I suggest after work
Costco - Brooklyn

If someone has a car, then we can meet at a metro stop, drive there, drive back and have less train changes. I have a bias to the Franklin Stop on the C Train, but don't really care :)

Then we can bring some extra jars to split up some items into? Make a shopping list and see what you want and who wants to split the huge quantity. A lot of things, respectively, so that is easier to split. Meat - comes in packs of steaks for $35, so that is good to split, bring some containers? Salmon is $6 per lb at Costco, $10-12 per pound at Trader Joes, so I do think it is worth the trouble.

I had a gun pulled on me and my phone was taken from me. I will say I think I got off pretty lucky considering I wasn't harmed and only my phone was taken as opposed to money/wallet/keys/etc. This happened walking home from the J stop at Myrtle/Broadway. Now I take the L to Morgan to avoid going down the same path.

Unfortunately ever since it happened I've felt super cautious walking around to the point of even looking over my shoulder sometimes and I hate that feeling. I'm not even a small guy or anything and to be quite honest I feel there are a lot of other mug-worthy people walking around the streets with their phones out and headphones on

* [Our video for the project](http://vimeo.com/43216845) 
* [Our Kickstarter Campaign](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1406680384/breakfast-with-strangers-50-meals-across-america)

If you are interested then please email us at breakfastwithstrangers@gmail.com and let us know in 500 words or less why you'd be the awesome breakfast interview as we travel across the USA for 5 months this summer. We posted a few months ago our beta version and had a ton of great responses from the Reddit community. We should be in Brooklyn during the second week of October. 

**The Details &amp; Route**

On July 18, ME and all places in between (and then back). Our camper van will serve as our home and mobile recording station on wheels for the next several months. Our route is going to snake east across the northern section of the USA and then snake back to Oregon along the southern route. We're gonna try our best to move with the good weather. 

Throughout our journey, flyers, word of mouth, Facebook, Twitter, Craigslist, Reddit, pure chance

**Why Have Breakfast with Strangers?:**

America is polarized. We feel that part of this civic problem is the lack of strangers connecting with strangers. We want to change this—or at least challenge it in our own small way—by taking strangers out to breakfast across America. We’ll share local diner fare and conversation, community, and commonality, culminating with a book: Breakfast with Strangers: 50 Meals Across America.

**The Conversation:**

This journey is a conversation. We’ll skip the small talk and ask the big questions

* www.breakfastwithstrangers.com
* www.facebook.com/BreakfastWithStrangers
* www.twitter.com/#!/BWS50Meals

**The Outcome:**

At the end of our trip we’ll select 50 breakfasts to highlight in our book

The most important outcome of all: the reminder that we are all part of a larger community.
Thanks for your consideration

The business has taken off and I've now started doing dog walking too. However

I'm looking for someone preferably 18-25 years old who lives in/by the area (Park Slope).The work is primarily in Park Slope but a little bit in Cobble Hill, be responsible and trustworthy. All payment is off the books. We pay $8/walk. Also if you liked we could set you up with dog boarding jobs too. You could make $30/night just for hanging out with, feeding, loving and playing with a dog. Its really one of the greatest jobs in the world.

As my business is just expanding into dog walking this wouldn't be a job where you would have work right away after being hired. It might take a couple weeks to build up the clientele for you to have a few dogs to walk. As time went on you could get more and more work. This isn't for anyone looking for a full-time job right away but good for someone who has some extra time after school, etc. Having a bike is a plus!

Good For You! Comedy Show. My friends and I are huge comedy nerds who were looking for a project. We knew enough professional comedians in New York to start our own comedy show. We figured if we could get people who were really excited about comedy, and a place for comedians to feel safe. We've done this, and because we're attracting an excited, welcoming crowd comedians have started talking. After only a few shows we're attracting comedians who prefer to come to our show to try out their Letterman/Conan/Comedy Central sets. This is a passion project (that's why it's free) and we're pretty proud of how it's evolving. Next show is this Saturday June 15th, at 9pm at the Cantina Royal restaurant on north 3rd in Brooklyn. If you live in the area, and are looking to see stand up headliners 100% FREE (the drinks cost money obviously, but there is no minimum) check us out.

Brooklyn's legendary Rubulad art party can only return with your help!!!
 
The Rubulad party
fallen on hard times
conservative neighborhood nearby its location. For over 15 years
Rubulad has been a seedbed of creativity
community of artists
produce their massive monthly multi-floor extravaganza which has been 
recognized internationally as a party no one should die without 
experiencing.
 
A family of creatives spend an entire week brainstorming
and decorating before each party. Hundreds of people line up to 
attend the eye popping finale that lasts far beyond sunrise
with streams of astonished attendees
their friends what they saw and did that night.
 
Thousands of photos of Rubulad are online
the next
and proof that ""they were there"".
 
Now is not the time for this gem to disappear. Rubulad has supported 
artists the best way possible, and 
showing them love.  Many artists have been put on the map because of 
Rubulad. Rubulad isn't just fun
 
Shall we let intolerance kill the creative hubs in our community? I 
say NO! But what can we do about it???....Rubulad has a Kickstarter 
campaign to raise money to move to a new location. We desperately 
need the money for expenses
fees and deposits. The money we make at the parties isn't nearly 
enough
down before they broke even. We've spent our reserves struggling to 
survive as long as we have
 
Please donate what you can in ANY amount to our Kickstarter!
Forward the link to your friends, blogs, forums, 
everywhere!
Their are great rewards for donating
part of Brooklyn will GO ON!

Isolated and scattered both refer to areal coverage.  Isolated refers to hit and miss.  We don’t expect that many storms.  That might equate to a 20-30% chance for rain at any one location.

Scattered would indicate a better chance for storms.  Rain chances would be between 40-60%. 

The other category would be numerous.  When we forecast numerous thunderstorms

UPDATE : I found out that he's been taken in by Animal Care &amp; Control. I didn't know it was a kill shelter before I called. I feel really bad now. I'm hoping somebody can/will adopt the cat. 

UDPATE 2 : I contacted AC&amp;C to find out his case number. I was feeling bad about sending him to a kill shelter and had decided to adopt him myself. After emailing them my request they sent back a reply letting me know that he had already been euthanized. I am feeling terrible about all of this.

My friend is a humble, she never actually has a day off for another two months. Both of us are paying off school loans, so we've been sort of lacking in funds for a bit, but still able to pay for a $600/month room + utilities and all things necessary for living in this great city.

Recently, but was abruptly forced out after a tour was abruptly ended. Recently, she found a nice place by the Brooklyn Museum stop on the 2/3, but her roommate decided to also abruptly end the sublet to allow her good friend to move in, thus forcing my friend out. She looked around on CraigsList, but you know that whole random roommate situation works out on there.

So I ask you this, incredibly friendly, respectful and quiet. She's also hugely into music, and an incredibly compassionate person (did I mention that she helps educate troubled inner city youth?). She's currently staying with my roommates and I until she finds a place to call her own and doesn't have to keep moving from place to place. Knowing her, she'd like to find something in the Prospect Heights/Crown Heights/South Slope area, where you can get to Harlem within an hour or less by train and it's not a pain/a scare to come back home.

My friends and I are huge comedy nerds who were looking for a project. We knew enough professional comedians in New York to start our own comedy show. We figured if we could get people who were really excited about comedy, and a place for comedians to feel safe. We've done this, and because we're attracting an excited, welcoming crowd comedians have started talking. After only a few shows we're attracting comedians who prefer to come to our show to try out their Letterman/Conan/Comedy Central sets. This is a passion project (that's why it's free) and we're pretty proud of how it's evolving. 

Next show is May 25th, but there is no minimum) check us out. Video from past performances and information about future shows located here: www.goodforyoucomedy.com
