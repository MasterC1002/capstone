I built (hired a team to build) an iPhone App
1) You set up a contact list. 
2) You determine who gets what level of alert, yellow, blue) which direct the recipients to how concerned about you they should be. 
3) In the case of a situation where you're alone and threatened you slide an alert button and it sends push notifications; and backup emails, streaming audio from your phone, and any pictures you might take. Responders with the app can even chat with you and each other to coordinate. Anyone who misses the event can still click on the link for the archived audio, pictures, chat, and location. 
  Essentially for rape prevention purposes, can hear everything we say or do, and now thanks to this picture definitely know that you're here with me. I'm leaving, and you're getting out of my way."" I am neither a rape victim or a rapist, but my feeling is that a few dozen witnesses who care about you would act as a very solid deterrent. Either the aggressor backs off and plays like it was all a big misunderstanding (maybe it was); or there's a recording of them victimizing someone floating around haunting them forever, maybe they end up going to jail, and maybe an outraged friend gets there before the police. 

As this thing evolved it became clear that it may have more uses. Pretty much anywhere someone might be in trouble because they're alone and vulnerable

Long story short
  One of the big problems is that RealHelp has no fulltime employee, and still have a full time job. I have poured tremendous amounts of time and effort into the design and promotion of the app, but also spend months at a time not pushing it.
  The other problem is a lack of traction. I'll admit that I'm not good at persevering when I don't see results. My initial assumption was that, people who raise awareness of rape issues online didn't seem all that interested. Some pointed out that creating a tool that could prevent rape was problematic because it raised the expectation that women should have to protect themselves. I also joined the Apps Against Abuse Challenge, but Circle of 6 stomped me, despite having what looked to me like a significantly less powerful app. Still, they haven't risen to the user base that I think something like this needs to make a powerful impact. I've since tried some press releases, but they've mostly been ignored. Right now I am not sure what direction to put my effort into to get results.
  The fact is, or Facebook built the functionality into their app (they could easily); then I'd be okay just scrapping it and moving on to new attempts to change the world for the better. I still think that it could do a lot of good, and I feel pretty guilty for letting it flop. 
  Honestly, or even someone with the resources to help it take off. I would kind of like to sell it or give it away at this point. Cash-wise I've sunk a new luxury car's worth into it, but I would be so happy to see it succeed under someone else so long as it succeeded. So any insights, advice, guidance, or offers you can give me will be well received. I'll also gladly answer any questions. 

TLDR: Built an app to fight rape and abuse. I dropped the ball on promotion and it didn't go anywhere. It works though

****

****

**`1.`  Look through your bookmarks/browser history (if it's a subreddit you've been to before)**

Check your bookmarks and browsing history if possible, give it a try, you might get lucky. 

****


**`2.` Create a notepad file of everything you remember about the subreddit (if it's a subreddit you've been to before)**


Type down everything you remember about the subreddit in a text document, description, possible things it might have been called, post titles etc...)  This may help jog your memory, at the very least it may help you find it using some other methods. 

****

**`3.`  Try and find the subreddit through people you remember posting/commenting there (if it's a subreddit you've been to before)**



Do you remember anyone that posted or commented in the subreddit regularly, with no spaces before or after, and hitting enter  http://www.reddit.com/user/  

Once there, there may be an alternative.

Go to [metareddit.com](http://metareddit.com/), and type in their reddit username in the box on the left [pictured here in red](http://i.imgur.com/JQpX7.png), and click the button marked stalk, [pictured here in blue](http://i.imgur.com/JQpX7.png).   

Using Se7en_Sinner as an example, funny, gameofthrones, gaming, gifs, harrypotter, iama, pics

If you can't find it either of those ways, again using Se7en_Sinner as an example](http://i.imgur.com/697XC.png).   

Alternatively
the tab in the upper left marked ""compose"" [pictured here](http://i.imgur.com/DTu6v.png)

****


**`4.`  Search for it using Reddit.com's Reddit's search**


Using either part of the subreddit name that it may contain or a subject (such as cooking

To get to the Reddit.com Reddits search:  Click [edit](http://www.reddit.com/reddits/) in the top right of the screen [(picture of it's location)](http://i.imgur.com/MENFA.png). 


To get to the Reddit.com Reddits search if using RES with default settings: Click the plus mark at the top right of your screen, click the link [edit frontpage subscriptions](http://www.reddit.com/reddits), [pictured here](http://i.imgur.com/gzni2.png). 


Once there, and wait for suggestions to appear.

You may also type it in where it says ""search subreddits by name"". (A bit misleading since that's not all it does) [Pictured here surrounded by a blue box.](http://i.imgur.com/yL28u.png) and press enter.


****

**`5.` Look through the sidebars and FAQs of related subreddits**

For example if you search for a subreddit about robots go to /r/Technology and look at its linked subreddits on its sidebar. Also some subreddits have a menu bar on top [like /r/Futurology] and some a multi-link

Also there are FAQ with collections of subreddits


[Location reddits](http://www.reddit.com/help/faqs/modsoftherealms) - [Animal reddits](http://www.reddit.com/help/faqs/animalreddits) - [Food reddits](http://www.reddit.com/help/faqs/fastfood/foodreddits) -

Special thanks to /u/psYberspRe4Dd and /u/greatyellowshark

**`6.`  Searching through Reddit threads and comments**



There are subreddits just for submitting subreddits such as /r/redditlists, /r/subredditoftheday, /r/redditdayof, /r/newreddits and /r/obscuresubreddits.  You may wish to search through them for words describing your Reddit or part of the reddit name.  

To search a single subreddit, click it to search just that subreddit.  [Pictured here](http://i.imgur.com/ExBfS.png) 

For more advanced features, check out the [search FAQ](http://www.reddit.com/help/search)  

Alternatively, though this may be a slim chance.

[List of Subreddit lists and multireddits](http://redd.it/13fazj)




****

**`7.` Google it**

Simply go to google.com, or part/all of it's name.

****


**`8.`  Find the subreddit through part of the subreddit name (Using subreddit explorer and RES)**


If you have an ideas on what a subreddit that you're thinking might be called, and if it finds any matches, they'll instantly be shown and highlighted, as [pictured here](http://i.imgur.com/oq8ec.png).

If you think the subreddit you're trying to find *starts* with a word/letters/numbers and have [Reddit Enhancement Suite](http://redditenhancementsuite.com)

(Note, contain it in the middle, or end with it.)

****

**`9.` Find the subreddit through tags or subjects (Using Metareddit



Can you think of the general subject or any tags that may be associated with the subreddit you're thinking of?

If so, and click the relevant tag if there is one.  (The larger the tag, the more subreddits it has.).  

If you don't see it

If you can't find the proper tag, and press enter.  [Search box pictured here](http://i.imgur.com/xjDQ4.png)


A somewhat simular site, looking for the tag that best describes the subreddit you want.  If you don't see the tags, click the button labeled ""subreddit tags"" [pictured here](http://i.imgur.com/ho6MJ.png)


There's also this [spreadsheet](https://spreadsheets0.google.com/ccc?key=ttpCnxB3rDcEbGTxSi9CBFw&amp;hl=en#gid=0), and is  sorted fairly well.  


****

**`10.`  Find the subreddit by looking at a list sorted by activity level/number of subscribers etc...  (through Reddit list


You might try looking for it on [redditlist](http://www.redditlist.com/)

You may also try using the keyboard shortcut CTR+F, if it's a subreddit you've been to before, finding about the proper amount of subscribers it had and scrolling up and down on the proper list.

Also

****

**`11.`  Find the subreddit by looking through a Reddit's directory/map. (through Subreddit suggester

If you know the general category the subreddit you're looking for is in or would be in

Simply look for the bubble with the category that best describes the Reddit you want

[There's also this picture that is similar



****

**`12.`  Go there and hope it exists**

Put simply, and press enter, seeing if it exists.  You may get lucky, or squat.  




****

**`13.`  Asking for help on a subreddit**



If the above steps haven't helped, /r/tipofmytongue, and last but not least, /r/TOMTcoldcase (only if it's been at least 24 hours since you posted in /r/tipofmytongue)

Before submitting to /r/findareddit however

And while you're waiting for an answer


****

**`14.`  Create it**

If nothing has come up, or [here](http://www.reddit.com/reddits/create).  If you do go this route, this [list of subreddits for mods](http://www.reddit.com/r/weeklyreddit/comments/xpho4/week32_july_30_aug_5_moderators_special/) may be of use to you.

First tree and replacement tree removed by a local non-Government organization and I want to know what I should do to right this wrong. ,NeedJusticeNow,13,4,3,"I'm not sure how much personal info I can put

A tree was planted in the name of a woman who died of cancer. Her and a large group of her friends who had lived in this city for most of their lives went through the entire legal procedure for the Dedicate a Tree program in the city. The location was picked by the Parks and Rec dept. The tree had a small and expensive plaque placed around its base and many of her friends and family (including her 3 sons) celebrated her life when that tree was planted. 

Without any consent to the Parks and Rec dept or the group of people who paid for the tree, then couldn't they have merely asked the Parks and Rec dept to remove the plaque by itself? And if this is true, then why did they remove the second tree? The second tree had no plaque. 

The event for the planting of the first tree was the last family event that the woman's father was able to attend before he died 2 weeks later. That event and first tree was extremely important to all of us. **I want to know

This organization is supposedly interested in the location's 'beautification' which to them apparently means to remove trees. I know this sounds like a first world problem, there is an empty plot. That empty plot is there because the organization, that is affiliated with half a dozen yacht clubs in an affluent area, found a way to take away the beautiful tree that existed there before.

Here is my situation

This maybe a somewhat long explanation

I am 20 years old (Male) and I have a sister who is 21 years old (obviously female). 

I am employed at McDonald's and have been for 3.5 years. I also work for my dad's business. My sister doesn't have a job and could care less to get one.

 I live with my parents and my sister ""lives"" her boyfriend. She only comes home when she needs stuff from my mom

My sister always says she is applying for a job and we all know she is full of shit. She waits for government checks and uses my mom's money by other asking for it or taking without asking.

She sometimes steals my money in my room

My sister is the most frustrating person on this planet and no matter how many times we confront her she is still an asshole to everyone. She steals from my parents and myself. She smokes and uses this money to buy cigarettes and party. 

My parents as well as myself have talked to her

One more thing

I need your help to get revenge on my asshole of a sister!
