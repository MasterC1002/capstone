The following method will prep your sprite sheet for you

Check out implementations on [r/jrpg](http://www.reddit.com/r/jrpg) and [r/beer](http://www.reddit.com/r/beer) to get an idea of what the end product will look like. 

**1. Find some images**

Any sizes will work

**NEW! Multiple steps combined into one!**

**2-4. Prep the sprite sheet and CSS**

Add all your images to a single zip. Go [here](http://spritegen.website-performance.org/). Change ""Class Prefix (optional):"" from ""sprite-"" to ""flair-"". Upload your zip and press go. Save the image output as spritesheet.png. Copy the CSS into a file

**5. Add a few more CSS selectors**

Copy and paste the following at the top of your CSS file (above all the stuff we just pasted in there):

	.flairselector .customizer {
	display: none !important;
	}
	
	.flair {
	border: none !important;
	top:20px;
	padding:0px;
	background: url(%%spritesheet%%);
	display:inline-block;
	}
	
Branching path! If you are using large flair and want it to appear docked to the left a-la [r/jrpg](http://www.reddit.com/r/jrpg)

	 .link .flair
	float:left;
	}
	
To Reddit!

**6. Upload to Reddit**

Go to your sub. Choose ""community settings"". Choose ""edit the stylesheet"" near the bottom.

First upload the sprite sheet. Click the browse button midway down the page

Now add the css. There will probably already be stuff in the big text box at the top of the page. If there is not, ""saved"" will appear in red and you'll be onto the final step. If not, you screwed one of the above steps up, but feel free to post questions here.

Final step!

**7. Enable flair**

Click ""edit user flair"" in your Admin Box. Check the two boxes under ""flair options"". Choose left or right as you see fit (if you chose the branching path

Click the ""edit flair templates"" tab. Enter the image name (without the .png) in the far right box (css class column) and click save. *If everything has been done correctly

**8. Final tips**

If you want to add more flair in the future

Hopefully this helps some people!

### Good moderation practices 
---
**Review reported links
On a periodic basis

Sometimes, or it might break whatever special rules you have for your subreddit.If you can’t tell, then just ignore the report.If you’re a junior moderator, and you think it might be questionable, or you’re just unsure, then don’t click ‘ignore’ and discuss it with the other moderators.

**Review the spam listing**    
The procedure here is the same as for reports. Review the posts and comments stuck in the spamfilter and take appropriate action. 

**Monitor submissions and comment threads
A useful tool to do this is by using the links listed at the top of this post. Remember to leave a distinguished comment where needed.

**Ban users when necessary**    
This is the most extreme sanction a moderator has available for dealing with troublesome users.If a user has had their posts repeatedly banned, you will probably want to discuss this with other moderators before banning a user completely.Note that when you do ban a user, they will get a PM, from you, stating that they have been banned. As mod you can also train the spam filter to ""shadowban"" a user, if enough of his posts get flagged as spam the filter will start to remove future posts and comments, this can be useful for those users that love drama. 

**Respond to PMs from users**    
Users contact the moderators for a variety of reasons

- asking if their submissions have been caught in the spam filter
- asking for help or guidance with a variety of things
- to report inappropriate behavior by other redditors

Please be courteous and helpful when responding to users who are asking questions in good faith.If they are asking about the spam filter, and if you can’t, try to find someone who can, or have them post their question in /r/help.

### Introducing Easy Flair! `Version 2.6`

## What this does

So currently, open your admin panel, enter the user's name, wait for a page to load, then copy paste the style you want to have and then hit save and wait. Even worse, if you messed up by just a bit, you have to do even more work to fix that issue.

**Who wants that**? I sure as hell don't.

Well

1. Simply hover over a user's name.

2. Click on the flair you want to give to your user.

3. Wait about five seconds for the request to go through.

4. And **BOOM**. That user now has that flair!

It's super easy!

[Have some screenshots](http://roguedarkjedi.imgur.com/easy_flair)!

## Where can I get such a fantastic tool?

Well

## How to install

* You need to have flair already set up on your subreddit

* There cannot be any flair specific CSS rules before the main `.flair` block. So if you are hiding the toggle for flair via `form.toggle.flairtoggle` or you are hiding the flair so it only shows up on comment pages

* There is no way to remove flair using the script. To remove flair

* If you find a bug or it doesn't work on your subreddit

## Success Stories

* ""We used RogueDarkJedi's script for /r/mylittlepony

* ""During the introduction of flair to our subreddit

* ""Easy Flair made it phenomenally easy to give the people on my subreddit the flair they wanted without needing to hassle with a bot. Instead of searching for each person on the flair page

* 2.1 - Fixed panel being too small

* 2.2 - Adds a couple of style rules and allows you to make a script that will work on modmail.

* 2.4 - Works again.

* 2.5 - Works on modmail again.

* 2.5 (Chrome) - Works correctly now.

* 2.6 - Added selector text and visual cues to help subreddits that have lots of flair. This is an option that is checked by default. Also fixed a bug that caused flair assignment previews to not work.

**edit:** Just made a semi-official announcement in [/r/reddit.com](http://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/iem31/ever_wonder_what_reddit_would_look_like_without/). Feel free to link to it or put it in your sidebar in your reddit if you want to support No Pics Day.

No Pics Day is a suggestion I raised over at [Theory of Reddit](http://redd.it/idjjf). With several reddits (like [fitness](http://www.reddit.com/r/modhelp/comments/id71z/mods_you_may_want_to_watch_this_rfitness_is/) and [gaming](http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/icoif/who_wants_to_reduce_the_flagrant_karmawhoring_and/)\) starting initiatives of their own

**What are we talking about here?** Think of it as the polar opposite of Critical Mass. Image posts have grown so popular on reddit that it's difficult for other sorts of content to get by. Right now, leaving very little room for news and articles.

What I'm suggesting is a single day where we each take it upon ourselves to give other types of content a fighting chance. Ideally, the front page would show a broader diversity of content.

**Is this even a problem? After all, right?** Maybe, but as has been pointed out before, image submissions have certain advantages over other kinds of submission that make them more likely to attract votes. For one thing, they demand less time on the part of the voter than an article, which means they can climb faster. When the number of pic submission making it into a reddit's new queue hits a certain threshold, they can start to push other kinds of content out of view even before potential voters have time to read and assess the value of those other links. I discuss that at more length [here](http://redd.it/glm65) if you're interested.

No Pic Day is about giving those other sorts of content a little breathing room so that they don't have to compete against a flood of pic submissions.

**Okay, and refrain as much as possible from submitting them. I'm not talking about voting them down -- we're not out to make them unwelcome on reddit or punish people for posting them. All I'm asking is that, for a single day, we reserve the power of the vote for other sorts of content.

**Okay, we're not. We shouldn't expect everyone on reddit to participate. A more realistic goal is simply to get enough people involved to make a difference.

And that's why I'm contacting /r/modhelp. Top-down support can go a long way toward getting something like this off of the ground. If you're interested in seeing what reddit looks like when we take the emphasis off of pics for a day, announce your endorsement to your community in advance. On No Pic Day, add a note to your sidebar, or use CSS to add a No Pic Day message to the yellow explanation box at the top of your submission page. Encourage your subscribers to play along.

**What if I run a reddit that's specifically for posting images?** We'd love to have your help

If you *are* interested, like /r/F7U12 and /r/pics, could encourage people to continue posting, but to refrain from voting on submissions. If they wanted to have a little fun with it (a la /r/trees pretending to be about actual trees) they could turn on the ""self posts only"" option and just have people describe pictures and script hypothetical rage comics all day. We're open to suggestions.

Right now, but that's not a lot of time, so if you need to discuss it with your communities, please do so sooner rather than later.

If you have any questions, now's the time to offer them up.

Thanks.

1. **Skip `http://www.reddit.com`.**

    Since you're already on reddit.com

        [reddiquette](http://www.reddit.com/help/reddiquette)
        [reddiquette](/help/reddiquette)

2. **Use short links for posts.**

    Take advantage of the short-link facilities provided by reddit to save yourself characters on links to reddit posts. For example

        [AutoModerator](http://www.reddit.com/r/AutoModerator/comments/q11pu/what_is_automoderator/)
        [AutoModerator](http://redd.it/q11pu)

    As it happens, so we can save even more characters by combining that knowledge with trick #1 above:

        [AutoModerator](/q11pu)

    This lets you link to any thread in 6-7 characters.


3. **Skip the title for comments and posts with parameters.**

    If you want to link to a comment from your sidebar, or `?limit=500` to load extra comments), the above trick won't work. You'll need to use some other tricks to slim down.

    _For comments:_

    The title portion of a comment link is ignored by the code. You can replace it with whatever you'd like - for instance

        [comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/changelog/comments/10ymie/reddit_change_a_small_rules_reddiquette_reminder/c6i81hk)
        [comment](/r/changelog/comments/10ymie/c/c6i81hk)

    `tag`, as long or as short as you'd like. The definition line (`[tag]: /r/modhelp`) should go at the very bottom of your sidebar.

1369248865.0,1eungh,Presenting the moderator toolbox!,creesch,48,12,6,"Being a mod on reddit can be hard work and even daunting at times. Reddit provides some core features in the mods arsenal that are indeed nothing more as the most basic things you need as mod. In order to remedy this a lot of people have created a myriad of userscripts in order to add or enhance functionality to the moderator arsenal on reddit. This has resulted in a fragmented landscape with a few very good scripts but more often userscripts that are not compatible

Based on this fragmented landscape /u/agentlame and I have tasked ourself to bring some order in the chaos. We have started to organise the toolbox available to mods in a set of userscripts that can be easily found at /r/toolbox. Some of the scripts that can be found there are based on existing scripts but updated to meet demand (enhanced modtools based on DEADB33F's awesome modtools, but also a single suite extension similar to RES.  Though, for now, we're focusing on adding features and making everything really stable and useable.

### Current tools:

I am making this post here as per recommendation of /u/krispykrackers .

The full story is far too long to post here

The basic story is as follows:

I recently contacted /u/LordGaGa

* LordGaGa changed the logo
* Very few things were posted. Only 1 or 2 a month. Mostly by people other than LordGaGa.
* Subreddit has been dead for the entirety of its existence
* Basically
* I should also note that according to research I have done by talking to older members of the [/r/mylittlepony](/r/mylittlepony) community and doing a metareddit stalk

I sent LordGaGa my request simply because, I persuaded LordGaGa to give me access, but she still wanted to stick around. (Which was no big deal to me.)

So I started off by working with a friend to prepare a new theme

From there I updated the subreddit, asked friends to post some content, went out and asked artists making relevant content to post it there, etc.

I was then informed by LordGaGa that she was reversing my ""SFW content only"" rule and allowing NSFW content. LordGaGa also started cross-posting content from \/r/clopclop. However, the community (as small as it was) did not like it and her two posts were downvoted pretty hard. Which, I belive, set her off and I come back to a ""forbidden"" page. So it seems that LordGaGa removed me as a moderator and set the subreddit to private.

I have contacted LordGaGa several times

I would simply like [/r/twilightsparkle](/r/twilightsparkle) to be restored so it can exist as a community again.

To quote [Vinod Khosla](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vinod_Khosla), as great as they are, are largely to simplify the process by which your users can increase your taskload.  And while I'm sure this will make it easier for you to do stuff for us, I think we can all agree that Reddit is likely to see its millionth reader *long* before it will see its tenth full-time employee.  

*In other words

The more I look at the problem, more responsiveness and more functionality that bypasses you, the bottleneck.  I would like to see you guys in a position where you are insulated from charges of favoritism and left to the task of keeping the ship running and improving the feature set, rather than attempting to police a million, two million or five million users out of a sub-lease in Wired's offices.  And I think we're more than capable of doing it, particularly if we have to work together to accomplish anything.

The ""rogue moderator"" always comes up as an excuse for limiting moderator power.  This is a red herring; there is no subreddit that an admin can't completely restructure on a whim (see: /r/LosAngeles) and there is no subreddit that can't be completely abandoned and reformed elsewhere (see: /r/trees).  Much of the frustration with moderators is that what power we *do* have we have fundamentally without oversight and what power we *do* have isn't nearly enough to get the job done.  The end result is frustrated people distrusted by the public without the tools to accomplish anything meaningful but the burden of being the public face of policing site-wide.  And really

*   *   *  

**Spam.**  Let's be honest: /r/reportthespammers is the stupidest, we've got dedicated heroes in there doing a yeoman's job of protecting the new queue but I'll often ""report a spammer"" only to see that they've been reported three times in the past six months and nothing has been done about it.  

On the other hand, he didn't even know what to do with it - you guys have no structure in place to address our lists!

**how about this:**  Take the idea of the ""report"" button that's currently in RES and instead of having it autosubmit to /r/RTS, *you guys shadowban it.*  I don't care if you make it automatic or make it managed; if the way *you* deal with spammers is by shadowbanning the way *we* deal with spammers shouldn't be attempting to shame them in the public square.

If you want to be extra-special cool, you don't have to tell me who else reported them, you don't have to tell me anything... but give me a little feedback on the fact that I'm helping you guys out and doing my job as a citizen.  *Better than that?*  Gimme a goddamn trophy.  You wanna see spam go down to nothing on Reddit, start giving out ""spam buster"" trophies.  You'll see people setting up honeypot subreddits just to attract spammers to kill.  /r/realestate is a mess; violentacrez testifies that /r/fashion is worse.  We know what subreddits the spammers are going to target.  Lots of us work in SEO.  Let us ape the tools you have available to you rather than taking a diametrically-opposed approach and watch how much more effective the whole process becomes.

*Which brings us to*

*   *   *   

**Community.**  How does Reddit deal with abusive users?  Well

Again, check this out.

I, this is something that should be completely automated and plugged into a database on your end.  Here's what I would like to happen:

1) I click ""police"" on a post.  This sends that post to your database.  You run a query on it - if you find what reads out like an address, a web page, a zip code (maybe any 2?) it goes to your ""red phone"" as dropped dox.  Should you verify it to be dropped dox, you f'ing shadowban that mofo right then and there.  Meanwhile, you automagically query that account for possible alts and analyze it for shill voting.  If it's been shill voting, you either warn or shadowban, I don't care which - the point is to get that username in the system.  In the meantime

2) By ""policing"" a user in my subreddit, but the user is now in your database as someone who has been policed for abuse.

3) If that same user (whose IP you have, spin out and let go.  Maybe they come back the next day and they're human again.  If not,

4) The second time a user gets policed by more than one subreddit he gets shadowbanned for a week sitewide.  If this isn't enough time to calm his ass down

5) If the user continues to be policed they pop to the top of your database reports.  At this point they've been policed by multiple moderators in multiple subreddits multiple times.  ***MUTHERFUCKING SHOOT THEM IN THE MUTHERFUCKING HEAD.***  I know you really, you're doing yourself no favors by permitting anyone who has been policed all over the place to continue to aggravate your userbase.  Ban those shitheads.

*   *    *   

These changes would hand over control of spam and control of community policing to your users.  Better than that, moderators could band together to report a user but c'mon.  You still have ultimate power and I can't imagine any drama like this in which the whole site doesn't scream bloody murder on both sides anyway.  By and large, *we're the ones with the headsman's axe.*  You go back to doing what you should be doing: administrating.

When I clicked on the imgur links, the link submitted recently by the scammer on r/lookatmydog used the exact same title as original submitted to r/corgi months earlier.

1316089262.0,kgfrx,I am a mod of /r/themepark. Here is a guide to the promotion of the reddit I have done over the last 2 years. This might help you or maybe you can help me come up with some new ideas? ,TedFromTheFuture,27,6,20,"[**/r/themepark**](/r/themepark) is a subreddit made up of theme park enthusiasts who love theme parks. It is a pretty common hobby and our subreddit is the only one who has information about general theme parks. 

The goal of any subreddit should be to get 1000 readers that self-sustains itself with active submitters and caring moderators.

To promote the subreddit

**Submit posts to subreddits that promote new reddits.**

[/r/newreddits](/r/newreddits), this works as a beginning push. If you get downvoters early, then your subreddit will probably not make it. So hopefully, you will get the attention of a few redditors and they will help subscribe. If things go well, you may possibly get a 100 subscribers doing this, but most likely it will be somewhere between 20-50 on average each time. Before posting to these subreddits, make sure you show that you care about it. Add some CSS, add a logo

**Make a submission to [/r/pimpmyreddit](/r/pimpmyreddit).**

This subreddit is ran by admins and it is created to promoting subreddits in the picture ad box on the right. This picture box is seen by a LOT of people. Remember though, and you might attract subscribers of the reddit to your subreddit, the same way with /r/newreddits. 

Alternatively, I contacted the admins about my predicament and they were willing to give me one when I asked that there should be a proper way for subreddits to be promoted. Now that this subreddit has been created, do NOT plead with an admin for a submission. /r/pimpmyreddit was created specifically for that purpose. 

**Paying for a text ad to be displayed**

Do NOT do this! While the money helps out reddit, I put down $40 for 2 days. It amounted to 10 subscribers and there were a few posts of people complaining that I had a hidden agenda of selling something, which was very much NOT true. You would really need to spend a lot of money to make it work and you really shouldn't be THAT invested in your subreddit unless you actually are trying to sell something. 

**Trade sidebar description links with other subreddits to your subreddit**

For a steady stream of subscribers over a year, decide to click on the link to your subreddit, and then decide to become a reader of your subreddit. I did this for /r/birdpics, and got on the /r/pics subreddit, and it worked perfectly. I didn't need to do any advertising after that. 

When asking another subreddit to add a link to your subreddit, but you would have to do something creative in return. For example, I contacted ~100 subreddit cities that have theme park locations. I then offered to have a link to their subreddit with a list of notable theme parks in their area. convincing redditors from my subreddit to visit their subreddit. But, in the end, most of these subreddits didn't really see a connection and decided not to link. You would have the same reaction to asking reddits that have nothing to do with your subreddit, which I have done, but the chance of success is slim. 

**Cross posts and comment links**

This is something that is popular to do for subreddits and if done right

The same results could occur with posting a link to your subreddit in comments. It is best to make sure that discussing your subreddit is on topic with the discussion. As said before

The major problem with x-posts is the inability to promote quickly in other subreddits. You would have to wait 8 minutes, make sure it is one subreddit that it really applies to. 

**Tag your subreddit and promote it in communities outside of Reddit**

There are a few communities outside of reddit that are made specifically for promoting subreddits. For example
success with this. 

**Improve your CSS** 

There are some links on the sidebar to the right. Use them! 

**Make valuable submitters in other reddits approved submitters**

One thing I would like to add that is not in there, I've gotten about 10 high-quality subscribers.

-------

In the end, but I hope my story helps you figure out the best way to promote your subreddit. And maybe, you can post below some ideas of your own that might be better? 

**Update**: In the past two weeks I have gained 87 readers, but not to the number you would hope for.

-----------------

I expect this will be a touchy subject, so please forgive me if I ramble.

What do the moderators of /r/modhelp

On a particular subreddit, and tools which ought only to be treated with respect.  When these tools are being misused or abused, there appears to be no official mechanism users can use to protest.

I expect a lot of people are going to answer that the users should make a new subreddit in that situation, obviously /r/ChironBetaPrime would be the choice subreddit, and /r/ChironiansBPRIME might be so unobvious that no one will ever find it except by referral.  There have been successful examples of subreddit fissions - /r/Games spun off from /r/gaming to what I believe is great benefit to both communities, but if you're dealing with a community who loves the guitar, they aren't going to want to settle for anything other than /r/Guitar . 

Should users fight to try and win back their communities in such a case?  **Can** users fight back to try and win their communities in such a case?  Or should they grin and bear it and learn to bear an inferior community just because the alternative would be a ghetto of a community?

He's a good guy, don't get me wrong, but he has never been very active. He just had the idea for the subreddit first and remains content to allow me to do all the actual work.

I have put a lot of hard fucking work into this subreddit. But guess what? We just had our best of awards. Two mods were nominated for various things. I was not one of them.

Mod3 and Mod4 are people I brought on earlier this year mainly to help with the modqueue (it had gotten to the point that I was the only person ever checking it so I demanded we hire a couple more mods; Head Mod agreed).

In short: our subreddit wouldn't be shit if it wasn't for all the fucking hours and *hours* and **hours** of work I've put into it. Meanwhile Head Mod still ""owns"" the subreddit even though he doesn't do shit and Mod3 and Mod4 get all the love from the community because they're always quick to say something popular in certain threads. Meanwhile, maybe the occasional generic, ""You mods are great!"" comment... usually posted as a reply to Mod3 or Mod4.

It's beyond aggravating. I love modding and I love the community ~~we've~~ I've created. I'm just sick and tired of not being recognized for my hard work. A couple of weeks ago I actually had someone ""correct"" me on a rule in the comments to a thread. My reply was, I wrote it."".

1290730679.0,ebty4,Tutorial: How to create a automatic Twitter account for your subreddit.,Raerth,26,5,28,"This tutorial will allow you to create a twitter account for your subreddit that automatically tweets new submissions. It will also show you how to place a twitter logo in your sidebar.

For an example of this in action

For more technically-minded redditors who are comfortable running a python script

***

###Step One: Create your twitter account.

1. If you need instructions for this I'd give up now.

2. Stay logged into this new account during the following steps.

***

###Step Two: Locate your reddit RSS feed.

1. Almost every reddit page can be turned into an RSS feed simply by adding the suffix `.rss`. Using this subreddit as an example it would be: `http://reddit.com/r/modhelp.rss`

2. You can either use your main page

3. Private pages and subreddits are more tricky

***

###Step Three: Create a TwitterFeed account.

Go to http://twitterfeed.com and open an account. 

&gt;This site uses OpenID

2. Click *Create new feed*

3. Click *Advanced settings* and use these settings:    

    * Frequency: **30 mins**    
    * Number of submissions: **5**         

    (If your subreddit has more than 5 submissions every half hour you're out of luck unless you use ketralnis' bot)        

    * Post Content: **Title Only**    
    * Post Link: **Tick this** otherwise the tweet will not link to the submission.    
    * I also add the hashtag `#reddit` as a suffix.    

4. Continue to the next page and select Twitter as the publishing platform. If you are still logged into your new account it will authorise.

5. The process is now finished!

***

###Step Four: Creating your sidebar Twitter logo.

1.  Save [this](http://imgur.com/ZKuu3) image to your desktop as `twitter.png`    

2.  Go to your subreddit's editing page and insert this link to the sidebar:

&gt;Follow us at \[]\(`http://twitter.com/`*mytwitteraccount*`)`

 3\. Note that this link will not be visible yet!     

 4\. Go to your subreddit's CSS editing page

&gt; `/*Twitter Feed Graphic*/`    
&gt; `a[href=""http://twitter.com/`mytwitteraccount`""]:after {`    
&gt;   `  width: 68px;`    
&gt;   `  height: 16px;`    
&gt;   `  content: """";`    
&gt;   `  background-image: url(%%twitter%%);`    
&gt;   `  background-position: -0px;`    
&gt;   `  display: inline-block;`    
&gt;   `  cursor: default`    
&gt;   `  }`      

 5\. Remember to replace ""mytwitteraccount"" with your **actual** twitter account.

***

You should now be done!

There were still 74 subscribers to the subreddit

I was given control on May 27th. There are now 163 subscribers. I'm pretty pleased with progress so far

I should not that I'm an LSAT tutor - having expertise in the area helped me attract users and talk to mods of related subreddits.

###First Steps - Messaging Active Users
----

I made a [quick announcement](http://www.reddit.com/r/LSAT/comments/u7ofm/announcement_rlsat_has_a_new_mod/) as soon as a I took over. Then I looked through the 12 threads on /r/LSAT to see who had posted within the past two months. They were likely still studying for the LSAT.

I sent an individual

###Step 2: AMA
----

Once things got going

I did a [separate AMA](http://www.reddit.com/r/LawSchool/comments/u9hy1/im_the_mod_of_rlsat_ama_xpost_from_rlsat/) on /r/lawschool. Since there was no active LSAT forum

These posts attracted a lot of comments, and commenting on every submission that was made. 

I set up a rss feed with metareddit's monitor. Whenever I saw an LSAT question posted elsewhere on reddit

As a result of my AMA on /r/lawschool

###Step #: Share Good content
----

I wrote a guide to LSAT reading comprehension that was well received. So I [x-posted it to /r/lawschool.](http://www.reddit.com/r/LawSchool/comments/uf0uq/guide_to_lsat_reading_comprehension_xpost_from/) I had previously gotten the ok from a mod there. Gained about ten subscribers pretty quickly. 

I also [cross posted that guide](http://www.top-law-schools.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=6&amp;t=185875) to a relevant forum

###Step 4: Reaching Beyond Reddit
----

I've been in touch with a few people who write LSAT Blog posts. So I contact them this week to let them know I was starting /r/LSAT up again

Meanwhile

###Results
----

I'm pretty happy with getting 89 new subscribers in a week. And there's a good level of activity. There were three user submissions today

As the subreddit grows

I basically plan to be hyper-active while this gets off the ground. Once it grows large enough it should be self-sustaining

The most useful tips so far have been:

* Use metareddit
* Reach out to users and encourage activity
* identify other relevant subreddits
* Ask modhelp for advice. This place has been a great resource.
* Produce good content to keep people interested.

People will always see your sidebar when they browse a submission of your subreddit. Make it good !

It will also be the text displayed after a [search ](http://www.reddit.com/reddits/search?q=jazz). The first line's better to be precise and spot on.

Most of the sidebars have some or all of this elements

 * A tagline : a short sentence defining the whole subject of your subreddit :
**""Long overdue sub-reddit for the heavy
 * A reddit's sidebar/description is going to be the main way that most people choose to add a subreddit. Include synonyms and related terms in it. An extremely brief description is very unhelpful.
 * Some notable and worthy posts
 * Maybe some guidelines
 * A ""Community"" or ""Tool box"" (""Important links"") section: a FAQ, official website, it all depends on your subreddit.
 * Eventually some [flair information](http://www.reddit.com/r/mylittlepony/)
 * And finally, just like that. 

But really, if you need to be verbose.

I'm a moderator of /r/adviceanimals sometimes there are people who report everything they can. [Here](http://imgur.com/BNnE6)  is a screen shot from 3 days ago of our front page. And there were many more reports too

1. Allow the moderators to see the names of the people reporting links so that if someone is reporting everything we can give them a warning/ ban them if necessary. Or maybe add a feature that allows moderators to take away a users privilege to report.

2. Set a limit for reports made in X-amount of time. Just throwing out random numbers here

3. Don't allow new users to report. This will help stop people making accounts to just troll the mods with reports.

Another great use of flair in a subreddit I'm subscribed to is [r/Dallas's neighborhood flair](http://www.reddit.com/r/Dallas).  They're a really effective use of flair templates to allow users to pick their neighborhoods and give things more of a community feel.

I'm not going to identify the groups (except directly to reddit admins) but I am sure it is well known there are communities with natural distrust and antipathy between them. The subreddit I moderate

Most of the regular contributors have been through these flamewars repeatedly, to not give that group any incitement to retaliate. 

But sometimes an ""agent provocateur"" comes in and deliberately tries to start mischief by crossposting something inflammatory to the other group. They'll find a post in our subreddit that is sure to cause a reaction, never used again. It's a pretty obvious attempt to start trouble. And it usually works. 

I wish there was a way that as a moderator, it would lead to ""balkanization"" of reddit.

So what can I do in a situation like this? I usually ban the provocateur and delete all his messages. The ban sends a message notifying the provocateur of the ban

&gt;I'll get this reversed. I am 1. Going to make a ----ton of throwaways. 2. Tell your mom tonight

Now I'm well aware that most trolls don't follow through, which provokes them even more. All we can do is clean up after the damage is done. Eventually things settle down. And then some provocateur will start the cycle again, and crosspost a provocation to another subreddit.

I'm probably going to need to contact the admins directly

Hey

Over at /r/gamedeals, etc.). Due to the nature of these accounts, it is possible for a user to be banned by the service and lose access to all of their games. It is largely unclear what actions will cause a user to violate the terms of service for these services. Because of the immense responsibility the we feel for our users, /r/gamedeals tries to provide as safe of an environment as possible. 

One of the ways we attempt to help our users safely purchase games is by removing all links to CD Key resellers. I would classify games sellers in two categories: white market and grey market. We attempt to deal in only white market keys. That is, getgamesgo, steam, etc. We attempt to remove grey market keys. That is, keys whose origin are largely unknown. Grey market keys are usually sold significantly below market value and are come from dubious sources. It is not uncommon for these keys to be stolen or purchased in regions where the price is significantly lower. Stolen or keys from other regions can result in the game being removed from your account, or in extreme cases, your account being closed. I also fear that some of these sites may not deliver the product that a customer purchased or may do nefarious things with their credit information.

To circumvent the rules of our subreddit

I'm not going to sit here and tell the admins how to monetize their site. I only ask that you review the kinguin.net again and determine if it is something that is appropriate for the users of reddit.

Thanks

-Adam and the rest of the /r/gamedeals moderation team

- Posts of this nature are more personal in a location-based community and might fly as actual conversation on top of someone getting their shout out. Leave the post as a result?

We have a [submitter](http://www.reddit.com/user/OortCloud) that apparently gets hit with the waiting queue thing despite having +2000 comment karma and a 3 year old account. What's going on with that? Does anyone know how to fix it aside from adding to the approved list? Apparently this happens in a bunch of subreddits

There are a couple of users who post (one regularly, /about.json still shows up, etc.). When this first came up, the decision was made that unless any given comment violated the subreddit's (or reddit's) rules, it should be approved - although an argument was made that shadowbanned users were probably shadowbanned for a reason, and perhaps should just be left alone.

Recently there have been people questioning this and stating that in essence approving the comments of shadowbanned users subverts the will of the site's administrators and negates the punishment given. However

I won't get into any specifics for domains/users

1. Users deleting their submissions. There are a few people that spam by submitting something, they delete it and submit it again. Some of them will repeat this quite a few times over a short period. You can see the history of this happening if you check the domain's ""new"" page (like http://www.reddit.com/domain/example.com/new), where deleted submissions show up. But if they're doing it for something that's hosted on a very commonly-submitted domain (youtube is the worst offender), it's almost impossible to find their history. This is also something that's very difficult to notice, unless you witness them doing it. I don't usually look at a domain's new page as part of a regular ""is this guy a spammer?"" check.
2. Mods removing spam, and start spamming the same domain from the new one. It's very difficult to form an overall picture of this behavior, because each user's history only shows a few submissions, and mod-removed submissions don't show up on either the search page or the domain page.

So about a year ago, and it didn't look like anyone was trying to do anything to change it, so I asked to become moderator. From there, with the help of some users, I helped win the Grow a College Subreddit Competition. I garnered 1000+ users, and now I have an active, flourishing subreddit of 2, with a great IRL community as well. I held our only successful meetups. 

The thing is, and I need some new mods. A few months ago, one mod came in and tried to implement a change without consulting the others (where one of the contingencies of me being a mod was that 2 other mods need to agree) or any of our users. It was not received well by me, but more importantly our users. One simply replied ""no,"" and was the top comment.

They don't see the other mods as mods anymore

There are many changes that I would like to implement on my own, I agreed that I would not make any decisions on my own. Well, to put it bluntly, I don't think the other mods should have a say in the changes i'd like to implement. It's no question that i've done more for the community than any of the other mods (combined), and I know what and who our subreddit needs. I also work closely with our users and know many of them personally, so I wouldn't trust the other mod opinion anyway. None of the other mods have been to a meetup.

I don't mean it to sound like i'm shit talking them, but certainly not checking in on our sub. I have a few people in mind that I would like to have on my team, but I want to be sure that I have the sole authority before I add anyone so I don't undermine others'.

1. go to your style sheet: http://www.reddit.com/r/SUBREDDIT/about/stylesheet 

2. in the text box

      .flair-CLASS {

    On choosing colors, blue) or hex values (#FF0000, #00FF00, #0000FF).  CLASS is just the word you will use to refer to the color setup you chose, any name you want.  Of course you can put other features into class, like a border and whatnot, but I kept it simple.  

3. Go to the flair page: http://www.reddit.com/r/SUBREDDIT/about/flair/

4. Put the name of the CLASS in the CSS Class box next to a user with flair (if you haven't assigned flair to any users

Trollpat gets the 'you have been banned' notice and creates trollpat2 within 20 seconds.

Instead of this, and allow trollpat2 to think his pics are being seen. This works for as long as trollpat2 doesn't search for his posts in the queue - which admittedly may not be very long at all. - but may be longer than 20 seconds.   it also helps train the spam detection tool.

1345425581.0,yhznw,a couple questions about reporting links...,Confucius_says,8,1,3,"First of all

I run a music subreddit. When I started out the spam filter seemed to flag a lot of new posts as spam and I had to manually approve them. My understanding is that over time the spam filter becomes ""trained"" (I've also been adding users who have a reputation of sending good links to the approved list..)

However the issue I think I'm having now as the subreddit grows (a couple thousand subscribers now) is that people are reporting links because they don't like the band or the song

The rule for my subreddit is that all posts that can be perceived as related in any way are acceptable and the community votes if they like the song or not. I don't like it when users report links and I don't notice it for 2-3 days later and the song loses its chance of receiving attention because of one guy..

My Questions:

How do I know if a link is being caught by the spam filter or if someone is reporting it? also is it possible to know who are reporting links? (or is this purposefully left anonymouse)

Are there any further steps I can take to stop this from happening? for instance to automatically approve common domains like youtube.com or soundcloud.com where legitimate links are often posted to..?

I imagine there is some css I can use to hide the report link.. but I figure trolls know how to circumvent that.....

I understand why the subreddit founder cannot be removed

The class should simply be ""flair-champaignurbana"" and that's what I have in the flair templates. This happens for all template flair now.

Lately there's been a rash of posts saying ""see what I made"" that link to the poster's blog. In some cases it's pretty obvious that the blogger is trying to become a Somebody in that world and is using /r/ to drum up traffic.

1) why does the spam filter catch some blog links but not others?

2) Is there a general /r/ consensus on self-promotion?  

3) Is it kosher to ask ""Please admit you're linking to your blog/etsy shop in your title""?

I just recently opened up /r/randomactsofkindness.  It's a place where people are free to request and offer cards to send a little happiness around the world.  There's a sidebar of rules and a [FAQ](http://www.reddit.com/r/RandomActsofCards/comments/1atdc6/faq_page/) page up for all to read.  

I don't have a cap on the number of cards people can ask for, for example.)  

However I've been flipping through posts and comments (to make sure things are running smoothly, ""Oh.  I see you've already asked for more than two cards.""?).  I didn't notice at first because sometimes comments or posts would get deleted.

I don't want to police people and say they're asking for too many cards because I think that isn't a good tone for the community.  Plus I do not have that kind of time or energy to commit to that.  However it doesn't really sit right with me even though they're not breaking the rules.  I guess I'm just a touch disappointed.  

I'm just wondering how other subreddits that deal with random acts of kindness deal with people who are taking more than their fair share of things for themselves.  Is it a concern?  Did you modify your rules?  Did you let it go and hope it evens itself out? Is this something I should worry over? I'm I just being too paranoid?  

This is my first time modding something and it's a community that I built up and worked really hard to get it off the ground.  I want to make sure I do it right with little to no drama to be a good mod that's there if needed
