You'd be surprised what you can do with 55 words. Consider the following amazing story by Jeffrey Whitmore.

`Bedtime Story`

`""Careful,"" he said, re-entering the bedroom.`  
`Her back rested against the headboard. ""This for your wife?""`  
`""No. Too chancy. I'm hiring a professional.""`  
`""How about me?""`  
`He smirked. ""Cute. But who'd be dumb enough to hire a lady hit man?""`  
`She wet her lips
`""Your wife.""`

It can be found in Steve Moss's collection

The story has three characters

So the challenge here is obvious. Write a *complete* story in 55 words (title and all). The emphasis here is on plot; something should *happen*. Bonus points for surprises

Annabel broke into a smile when she saw me coming down the corridor. She was the only nurse that Emma, she came in sick, she gets her treatment and then they ship her back home, no need to talk to or make a product laugh, but Annabel wasn't like that. I would often find the two of them sitting on the bed, laughing and playing cards. Annabel was always there after every procedure, as if they were sisters

""How did it go?"" Her smile drops slightly

""You first."" She asked teasingly, and I didn't want to lie to her after all she has done for us.

""Not so good."" I try to soften the word with a smile, but don't worry about us, we'll be fine."" This time Annabel's smile fell right off. She bit her lip before she answered.

""I'm afraid I have some bad news too."" She failed at masking her disappointment with a smile just a miserably as I had.

""What?! Why didn't you tell me right away? Did something happen to her?"" Annabel hurried after me as I ran into room 402.

""No, she's just tired."" Despite her words my heart was thumping in my chest until I tore back the drapes around Emma's bed and saw the frail, hairless girl stirring and grunting softly, the way she always did when she woke up.

""What's wrong

""Nothing

""I'm not dead yet

""I know, I should probably make sure."" I held her down and tickled her, planting kisses on her scalp while she screeched with laughter.

""Stop! Help! I'm going to die!"" Emma wheezed

""You're not going to die."" I told her solemnly. ""I won't let you.""

""I don't think the cancer cares what you think

""He better, Annabel was the first to speak.

""I don't know if I ever told you this

""I don't know about that. What kind of father can't even pay his mortgage."" I felt my cheeks turn bright red

""The kind that knows she needs you by her side more than she needs your money."" That's what I've been telling myself

""Thank you. Really

""What I wanted to talk to you about is the results from the scan she took yesterday. It appears she's been having trouble with her liver."" Annabel pointed out a few numbers on a chart that meant nothing to me.

""So what does this mean

""She's not in any immediate danger, covering me from the inside.

""Two thousand dollars..."" I sank down to the floor in the empty hospital corridor with my back against the wall. ""I can't do it."" Saying the words was like opening a flood gate, they're all coming down on top of me and that wouldn't even be so bad, but Emma will get crushed with me and I can't let that happen. She deserves so much better. She deserves..."" I don't even know what I was going to say, so instead I simply sat there with tears rolling down my cheeks. 

""She deserves a full and happy life."" Annabel placed a hand on my shoulder and crouched down next to me.

""She will have it. I know things aren't looking good right now

""How can you say that? There's nothing to think off

""Is what?""

""I've got to go.""

~

After three hours of driving through the darkness, yet here I was with nothing but a thin wad of cash in my pocket and barely enough gas to get back home. I passed the one-armed bandits in the hall and approached the woman behind the desk.

""I would like all of this in chips, instead she took the money, counted it and handed me a small stack of chips. 

""Here you go, young men with a dangerous flash of intelligence in their eyes at the poker tables, beautiful women in long dresses playing Blackjack while scanning the room. I had never felt so out of place in my life, but I could not go back now, this was the only way. For a moment I entertained the idea of sitting down at a poker table, I had seen how much money you could make at poker if you played it right. I had played in home games since I was a teenager, but even in those games I was never among the best, poker wasn't my game. Instead I turned to scan the room for something else.

I wandered around for a while, some smirked while others cursed their luck as they saw their hopes and dreams get pulled away by the rake. I sat down at a Roulette table and watched as the board and the ball spun in opposite directions. It hit the edge and started bouncing around, until it finally slowed down and came to rest in a black slot.

""22 Black!"" A man in the same vest the woman at the front desk had been wearing called out.

""What is the payout for betting on a single number?"" I asked the man.

""35:1. Would you like to place a bet

""Uhm... no thanks, so I asked him if I could please borrow it. After some persuasion he agreed. I almost laughed when I saw the final number, I had to double check to make sure it was right.

""293 times 35..."" I muttered while I counted it again.

""10255."" Just enough to pay the bank, everything I could have hoped for. I gave the pen and paper back and sat down at the Roulette table again.

""Betting this time

""Yes, making it spin and bounce while I watched it like a hawk.

""Come on..."" Someone next to me muttered, it slowed down and stopped, resting in the black slot labelled eleven.

""Better luck next time

~

The drive back home was the longest three hours of my life. I pulled over at a bar to get something to numb the pain, everything is my fault, just like the man at that bank said. If I was a better person, a better father, none of this would have happened. I deserve every stab of pain and guilt I feel and even thinking about having a drink when my daughter had been missing me for hours without knowing where I was or when I'd be back made my guilt double. The nurse at the front desk gave me a strange glance when I barged in without a word, but did nothing to stop me.

I looked at my clock before entering room 402. 3:30 AM. Emma lay in her bed, she had a newspaper in a slack hand, but her head was tilted back and she was snoring softly. I took the chair next to hers and placed it next to Emma's bed. I clutched her hand in mine and buried my face in her blankets.

""I'm sorry."" I sobbed into her lap, but the touch made me flinch as if it was painful.

""Come

""We're not allowed to smoke in here

""No."" She said and lit the cigarette. I took it and inhaled deeply, but at least my trembling hands steadied a little.

""So where were you?"" Annabel asked and took a drag from the cigarette.

""Drove to Vegas. I put everything on one spin of the roulette."" Annabel smiled sadly.

""I thought you might do something like that.""

""Aren't you going to ask how it went?"" She shook her head.

""You're not very good at hiding your emotions."" I chuckled through my tears.

""No, maybe it'll be all right."" It was meant to be a joke, but no one laughed.

""You don't have to do that."" Annabel said and took another drag from the cigarette.

""I don't see what else I can do. I'm out of options. I don't have so much as a dollar and the bank is about to take everything I own. I doubt they'll even leave me the clothes on my body."" Annabel offered me the cigarette

""They won't take anything from you."" Annabel reached into her front pocket and pulled out a slim piece of paper and gave it to me. It was a check signed by herself.

""Eleven thousand dollars...?"" I looked at the check and then at Annabel in disbelief. ""I can't take this money

""Take it. You need it more than I do."" I shook my head.

""Why? You have hundreds of patients and we're surely not the first that can't pay. You can't go paying everyone's medical bills

""I'm going to tell you a story that I've never told anyone before. When I first started here as a nurse, but I soon connected to one of the patients. He was an old man by the name of Aaron and he had leukemia. He never had any visitors so one day I asked him about it and so he told me his wife had already died and there was no one else. I stayed with him to keep him company that night. 

After that he, everything he had done or wanted to do and all the things he had seen, but for every passing day he grew weaker. One day looked even weaker and paler than usual when he called me into his room, but he assured me he was fine. He told me a story of how when he was a young man he had found an older man in an alley, beat and bloody, half the bones in his body broken and left to die. Aaron took the old man in, helped him to the hospital and helped nurture him back to health

When the old man had recovered, asking only that he passed it on to 'you are good, you need it more than I'. After he finished the story he passed the money to me and told me 'you are good, you need it more than I'."" Annabel looked at me in silence for a while, then she leaned in, squeezed my hand with the check in her own hands and whispered to me.

1367024824.0,1d6wbt,"[PI] Inspired by ""First Breath After Coma"" by Explosions in the Sky",AdvocateForLucifer,195,153,1,"I had the dream again; we were walking hand-in-hand down the road during the dark of night. We were young -- we were stupid. We didn’t think to look before we stepped out into the middle of the road; it was night

I looked around the hospital room that I had called home for months. In reality, I left a part of me behind, which kept me coming back every day. And every dark night, reminding me of how young and stupid we were.

It’s amazing how a few months can age you. My eyes had grown baggy, and the smile he had loved so much never brought itself out anymore. What use was smiling in a world he wasn’t in? *Got to stay positive, Becca, stay positive for him. He’s still alive, just asleep. A deep, dark, sullen sleep.*

He was in a coma, he told me as much the first time we made it. I loved him too, I realized in the stale air that followed his confession, but I didn’t say that. I should have said it more. The only time he heard me say those two deadly words was the night of the crash. Our anniversary. The end of one great year, and the start of a terrible one.

We went to the same restaurant that we had gone on the first night; it was expensive beyond his means, and even longer before I accepted his suggestion. *He was so resilient then. If only he could pick him self up and dust himself off like he did all those times I said no.*

The only sounds in the hospital room were of my breathing and the machine that monitored his heart. The beeping filled my head like a song; but it’s a song I’d rather turn off in exchange for him looking at me one more time, one last kiss, one more passionate night under the dark sky by the lake. I wanted the beeping to stop, but I knew that as long as it kept going, he was alive and he was with me, and we were still invincible. Nothing would come between us; not a fight, not another man or woman

My hand fit in his and held on tight. After that night, but together we were strong, we were invincible. In my dreams I don’t let go, and the car doesn’t hurt us, we hurt it. The boy is flung out the convertible top and lands in the hospital bed instead of us in this room with the beeping machine and stale air that I woke up to every morning. 

I didn’t hate him. He was young and stupid too. His name was Matthew, his hand shaking. I could tell he didn’t sleep much either. Did he have the same nightmares as me? Of course he wished just as much as I did that the night had never happened, and of course he was thankful that no one had been killed. But he didn’t know how it felt to be here, in this chair, with his love’s hand in his, listening to the droning beat of a machine keeping him alive.

It was still going. BEEP! BEEP! BEEP! The noise filled my head and drowned my thoughts with the idea of an alarm. It kept the same beat. The doctors told me that was a good sign; if it varied too much, if you can’t think?* He would never walk again, the doctors assured me, but I just wanted him to talk again, to smile again, to be again.

BEEPBEEPBEEPBEEP! I jumped back in shock, I stepped back, “Tell me he’s okay. He’s okay. Okay.”

They didn’t answer, we’re invincible.* I ran over to hold his hand, squatting under the physicians going about their work. They pretended like I wasn’t there. *I’m not invincible, I’m invisible. They don’t see me? Can’t they see how I’m hurting, how much I need them to tell me it will be alright?*

The beeps kept coming, and the beeping that assured me that we were still alive.

I still dreamed of that night every time my eyes let themselves close, and we’d still be singing songs in the shower and watching soaps on TV, and laughing at jokes only the two of us would ever understand. It was my fault. I was too proud, too cold to his advances. I did this to him, and he had saved me. He had pushed me to the curb while he took the impact. My impact. Our impact. He broke our invincible wall to keep me safe. Every morning I thanked him with a kiss on his pale lips, wishing so much that they’d be full of life like they were before that summer night.

I leaned in and tasted the chapstick I rubbed on his dry mouth the night before. When I pulled away, stunned by joy.”He’s awake! Doctor! Get in here! He’s woken up!”

I pressed my lips to his, so as not to let it go. He was alive. He was awake. We were okay! The doctor came in and confirmed what I had thought. His eyes were still closed, but the coma was over. I held his hand tighter than ever, waiting for the lids to move and show me his charming brown eyes again. Our hands gripped on top of his chest, his lungs suddenly expanding. The smell of his breath was terrible, but it was his and I loved it. I stayed smiling down at him until finally, his eyes opened.

I didn’t say a word as he took it all in, a smile brighter than any I had ever given crossing over my cheeks. “Rebecca, where are we?”

“We’re together.” I said gently

“Are we…” He was struggling “in a hospital?”

I brushed his hair out of his eyes; I didn’t realize how much it had grown. “Yeah

“What…happened?”

*Do I tell him about the crash? That he’ll never walk again?* I could feel tears coming from deep inside, I was running. You said I shouldn't go, but I did. You chased after me, remember? Then there was the flash, you pushed me, I screamed as loud as I could. I ended up with a scuffed arm, you ended up in a coma. I shouldn't have run. I shouldn't have let go of your hand.   
“We were fighting about something stupid. That’s why I ran away in tears. You said ‘Becca

I wiped the tears away

Just let it end. Let it be over. Let him be okay. I’m still here. While we’re together we’re invincible. If we had stayed together…

The doctor was there standing over me. I looked up at him, it seemed, but I wasn’t sure how long they’d be there. I closed my eyes, hoping that it was all just a dream, but the beeping stayed, coming slowly, threatening to end any moment…   
Beep…   
Beep…   
Beep…   
…   
…

I looked up at the doctor, and my tears soaked the thin white cloth.

**PREVIOUS ASSIGNMENTS**

Currently there is only one previous assignment

As with the previous assignment, improve it, keep it for future use. If you DO decide to post it, make it its own post and label it with the [PI] tag.

**ASSIGNMENT**

Pulp novels and magazines were all the rage in the early 1900's. The pulps birthed many a famous character: Conan the Barbarian, Fu Manchu, Hopalong Cassidy, Zorro, Tarzan... the list goes on. In fact, you can [read more about pulp fiction in this wikipedia article.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulp_magazine)

So we get to the nuts and bolts of the assignment with the prompt, as you are writing in the mindset of what people knew of outerspace in the early 1900's. **OR** go to [this pulp science fiction title generator](http://thrilling-tales.webomator.com/derange-o-lab/title-o-tron.shtml) and generate a title for your story and write a story revolving around that title.

**LESSON MATERIALS**

Now here comes the fun part. I've collected, quite extinct, magazine ""**Fantastic Adventures**"" - and, they fall under public domain since the copyright registration has long since lapsed. Not only that, but its sister magazine Amazing Stories is readily available through web.archive.org. As well as a host of other quite enjoyable pulp magazines.

The idea is for your to steep yourself in the worlds presented by various authors. With the collection of Fantastic Adventures

*BOOKS/MAGAZINES*:

- [FANTASTIC ADVENTURES Volumes 1-4](http://dropcanvas.com/6hnam) - Once extracted, I have about 10GB more of them, PM me.

In fact [click here](http://archive.org/search.php?query=mediatype%3Atexts%20AND%20subject%3A%22pulps%22) to see all the pulps they have to offer. What's great is that you can download in most file formats. Click ""All files: HTTPS"" to see every single file format they offer.

I have been mulling over the idea of offering a series of writing lessons to this subreddit, each lesson will aim to improve a particular skill (though, sometimes it will not be outlined as to which skill that is.) There are no awards, just satisfaction in accomplishing something and maybe adding more to your writing portfolio.

**ASSIGNMENT**

A lot of authors wither at the mere mention of fan fiction. However, writing a bit of fan fiction you know the characters, you know where they live, you have a great idea of the types of things and situations they'd interact with. The only thing you need be worried with is the story itself. For aspiring writers who focus too much on world building, often the story is the thing that gets lost in the mix. So, let's toss all that world building to the side for now and focus on the world of Sherlock Holmes.

Your prompt and assignment is the following: Write an interaction between Sherlock and his assistant Watson. It will be Watson chatting with Sherlock about a previous adventure in his life. There is no limit on the length of the story. Your particular story can take place with either the old fashioned Sherlock or the modern one. Whatever inspires you.


**LESSON MATERIALS**

A wide swath of Sherlock books are in the public domain. They are free to read and are excellent written

Good news

Oh, the subscriber count stayed at about 33. I found the subreddit on July 22nd and was dismayed at how dead it was. I sent a message to the creator (LouY, who deleted his account many months ago) and asked if I could take over. He relinquished all controls. I had one goal in mind for the following year: To get at least 1,000 subscribers into the fold of writing. I am so pleased that we've hit that number ten-fold in well under one year of ""new management.""

There are quite a few people to thank for the growth

Obviously, /u/sakanagai, /u/lordmalifico, /u/AA_AgonistAgent.

They are all wonderful and for different reasons. You can see the short interview we had with /r/subredditoftheday here:

http://www.reddit.com/r/subredditoftheday/comments/1f6s3b/may_28th_2013_rwritingprompts_the_ultimate_test/

Which is just one of the ways in which our subscriber count grew. As well as having quite a few highly upvoted /r/bestof posts. In fact

This has been such an awesome almost-first-year. We've got a lot of things planned for the coming months. NaNoWriMo prep, and because I haven't finished critiquing everyone from last week yet.) We will be testing out allowing links in the near future and, well, a lot of other fun stuff. Also, look forward to the third lesson either today or tomorrow. I will also be uploading more pulp sci-fi in smaller chunks for the users who requested it as part of the second lesson.

Cheers!

“Chaos happens because,” I explain. 


“Ok... but that’s not true. We can predict the weather


“Ahh,” I ask, hoping she won’t actually answer. “No, we can’t. Not successfully at least. The best weather systems in the world can’t determine how the weather will act a month out with one hundred percent certainty.”


“And that is because?”


“Because too many things happen that can change it. Any little thing can drastically affect the outcome of an event.”


An exasperated sigh. 


“I just don’t understand how I’ll ever need any of this


As she releases another obnoxious exhale


“What you don’t understand is that this is everywhere!” I spread my arms out as I say “everywhere


“Aha! See


Instead of acknowledging my wit


“Thanks


“Where are they?”


“Nevermind, I could easily understand why she was wearing a sweater. I wouldn’t wear that out in public. What would you call that exactly? A bandeau? 


She’s on her hands and knees in front of me

“What the fuck is going on


I turn to face the largest, and partly because he is a terrifying human being. His mohawk gave him another six inches of height on his already 6’2” body. He had tattoos on his neck and arms, which were clearly visible due to the fact that his denim shirt had its sleeves torn off. He had, what I’m pretty sure was a Confederate flag bandana in the back of his oil-stained jeans, and I’m almost positive you would have trouble fitting tires over his biceps. In fact, I think one of the tattoos on his arm mentioned how he was a “strong mo’ fucka”. Fitting.


With perfect timing, to greet her fuming boyfriend.


“Why the fuck are you yelling” she yells back.


“I come home with you on your knees


“It’s a bandeau


He takes a step towards me and lowers his head to closer match my pathetic height. I can feel his heated nostril breath on my face.


“What did you just say


“It’s a bandeau?”


He glares at me in silence for a moment before he continues.


“If you want a problem


“No. That is the opposite of what I want.”


He tightens his fists at his side.


“We weren’t doing anything


“Yeah


“That doesn’t even make sense


 They’re yelling at each other and I take this opportunity to take small footsteps towards the door. I think that in all this rage my absence would hardly be noticed.


“Where do you think you’re going


“You come into my house? You mess around with my girl?”


Melissa is futilely pounding hers fists against his gargantuan back.	


“Let him go


“I wasn’t messing around with her


He raises an eyebrow and then tightens his grip on my shirt.


“What’s that supposed to mean


“Uh... I mean... she’s attractive...”


His fists tighten and he raises me higher into the air. I’m glad there isn’t a ceiling fan. That would be just a gratuitous amount of violence.


“...but


He throws me on the ground and right before he is about to kick my head in


“Stop it


I’m hurt. Both my back and my pride. I think I landed on something too. Maybe it was that stupid Hotwheels car.


“I saw you two though. Don’t lie to me


I’m lifted (rather uncomfortably) by my hair and the back of my collar until I’m on my feet.


“If you want a fight



I stand up straight and he pushes me back a little. I stumble back a couple feet. I’m panicking. What am I going to do? This guy could kill a buffalo if he wanted. He’s crazy.


“I’m gonna fucking murder you.”


He takes a step towards me and I raise my arms in front of my face and slam my eyes shut


“Oh my God! Get help


“What just happened?”


“He slipped! Oh my God! Call 9-1-1, mascara and tears streaming down her face and onto the forehead of her crumpled boyfriend.


I look down at them. He’s lying on his back


“Don’t just stand there. Do something


So I do. I grab my physics book off the couch and put on my jacket. 


“What are you doing?” She stares up at me.


As I’m zipping up


“What are you doing



I walk over to the car and pick it up. The car in my palm makes me smile. Such a small car brought down such a large man. A car that wasn’t supposed to be where it was sitting anyways. Ahh



I turn to face the couple as the boyfriend slowly opens his eyes. Groggy and wincing, and then back at his girlfriend.


“What happened here


I walk towards him and place the car neatly on his chest.

The point is to draw the character on a piece of paper. Expression, they're all up to you and they all contribute to the character. You have only one day. Even if you forget it in your desk, you write about it. Is it tortured and hallucinating? If it desolate for being forgotten? Has it learned a way to cope and grown stronger? The events of the story MUST be true. However, you can embellish as you wish, and portray the events through the voice of the character.

1. Go to www.tvtropes.org and click the ""random"" button three times to get three articles. (I couldn't get this to ""open in a new tab""
2. From your pool of three random pages
3. Write something that uses the other two tropes.  
4. Post your work preceded by links to *all three* tropes. Tell which one you rejected (and why if you like

If you're lucky (for some definition of lucky) you'll have to challenge yourself to unify both tropes and hopefully get a worthwhile result.

This week we are going to focus on character bios. Now remember: Participation is not compulsory. As well

Character biographies can be a wonderful thing. They help your develop a real relationship with a character. A good template to use is a wikipedia article on a person in history that your character might be similar to. You can learn about their childhood, training, relationships with friends, etc.)

Things your character biography ought to include: A name. Unless your character is nameless (a fun challenge that some writers have pulled off) you're going to want to figure this out first. A lot of people beginning NaNoWriMo often get stuck at this very point. Don't let this be your hanging point! First think of your characters parents nationalities. Maybe they're slightly hippy irish people. Their daughter is named Misty O'Brien. Perhaps they're both Finnish

The name sorted

There are quite a few beneficial things about doing this: You might come up with story ideas based on other characters mentioned in the bio. You can organically create other characters that appear in your story that have a history with one of the main characters.

----

I died once. No

But I didn’t have any family that I knew of. I didn’t have any close friends or a significant other to miss me

“He’s waking up” were the first words I heard after dying.

The room was so bright when I opened my eyes. All of the surfaces and furniture were either white or shiny steel. There were bright lights in the room that those surfaces reflected. I guess my eyes hadn’t been used in a while so it was very painful to open them.
A man in a white lab coat walked up to me and asked “How are you feeling?”

I tried to move a bit to test how my body was really feeling only to discover I was strapped

“Why am I strapped down?” I asked

“We didn’t want you to hurt yourself when you woke up

“I’m Seth

“I’m Mark.”

“I know. Mark
I remembered the hospital and I remember losing consciousness. I also remembered some intense and crazy dreams. Had they happened before I died? Or were they memories of an afterlife? The color red was so intense in the dreams. Fire. Screaming. Earthquakes. Intense heated winds. Had I gone to Hell? Or had I dreamt that I had gone to Hell?

“We pioneered a way to bring people back to life

“I guess that means I owe you my life

“You could say that

“What do you want?” I asked.

“We’re not sure how long the serum is actually going to work on you. It’s possible that your body will revert back to its original damaged state."" Seth pointed at the man in the lab coat. ""This man

“I like the idea of remaining alive

“You are free to go now

I agreed and spent the next few months going under for surgery and waking up to tests of strength and endurance. Every time I came back from surgery

I saw a woman hugging a limp, running around the woman. “Not again,” she had cried out. How many times had she cradled that child and cried?

I told Seth about the dreams after the third surgery. “What if I went to hell when I died?” I asked. “What if every time I am put under anesthesia my soul returns to hell?”

“I don’t personally believe in Heaven and Hell

Roger had been in the room for this conversation. His eyes went wide as if in terror. “Boss, well, they all had religious affiliations. We’ve had Christians, Jews, Muslims, and even a Jainist.”

“What does that have to do with anything?” asked Seth

“Well

“No

“I think you went to Hell

“You’re being a superstitious kook

“But people don’t dream under anesthesia

[Read my reply to faiban who is one such person](http://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/11z81e/nano_prep_week_4_subplots_antagonists_research_oh/c6tkmgz
): ""You needn't worry. If you've done little to no planning at all - the intent is just to write. Even if you write off the top of your head! You can do it. Just, middle and end so you have a hint of where to go. Point A to Point B to Point C. The whole intention of NaNoWriMo is not to necessarily write the best you can, it's to flex your writing muscle and actually finish something. The more you work those muscles, the better your future works will be. It's about learning what works and what doesn't work for you when you set out to write things that are more thought out. I do hope you participate!""

-----------

The next message I have is to those who say ""But I won't have enough time to write in November! I have school! I have work! I have a very active sex life!"" To those people I always recommend the very witty note John Hodgeman (who you may know from The Daily Show and the Mac Vs. PC ads - he was once a literary agent) - which you can [read here](http://www.mcsweeneys.net/articles/another-example-of-the-illuminating-correspondence-between-john-hodgman-professional-literary-agent-and-his-cousin-one-josh-who-aims-to-be-a-man-of-letters
). An excerpt from the advice that is particularly thoughtful: ""*Given your demanding job as a temporary employee, salaried positions with benefits. Melville, for example, was a famous whaler. Did you know that? Borges was a jeweler. Some critics argue that their writings were enriched by their every day, 9-5 experience in the office. But whatever the case, they MADE the time to write.*""

So, they might not have written their works in a months time... but if you truly feel you can't write 1,200 words or so a day, perhaps limit yourself to at least completing a novellette or novella.

Throughout your writing, include the zombies subreddit. You get the idea - only add subreddits that will increase your creativity rather than distract from it.

Here are some subreddits you should consider checking in with throughout the duration of NaNo:

- /r/wordcount - This is a really fun one. Have everyone cheer you on throughout the month.
- /r/KeepWriting - This is a community that will help you with the nuts and bolts of things if you have a question. They can help keep you motivated.
- /r/Whatstheword - Got a word that you just can't quite remember? They can help you figure it out.
- /r/logophilia/ - Introduces you to words that are cool to expand your vocabulary.
- /r/Comedywriting - This is more a more specific reddit dedicated to humor.
- /r/nanowrimo - Well, etc. - you will find it all here.

Got a subreddit appropriate for this list I may have missed? Comment so I can add to it!

See you on the other side!

Welcome, this will all go well! Remember - *any* writing is a victory!

So, a LOT) about the characters we want to write about. Now we get to do one of the most entertaining parts of the whole writing experience: The story outline.

There are many ways with which you may feel comfortable coming up with a plot outline. Myself, though. At the end of this entry, I will list a few of them with links to the sites for download.

If you've never written an outline before, romances, etc. - but, I swear once you get down to it, it'll flow out of you.

There are different ways one can approach this. The simple chapter by chapter breakdown is probably the easiest to keep track of. I will create an example for you so you can understand. Let's say I'm writing a story about a frog that is prophecied to rule the planet. Let's also say it's just going to be a six chapter novellette. Here's how my plot outline might look for the first chapter:

**CHAPTER ONE**

- Open on a tragedy. Froggy's parents killed by humans. Froggy swears revenge.
- Fast forward five years. Froggy has learned the language of man. He infiltrates a pet shop and shows off his speaking abilities. News coverage around the world.
- Froggy gets his own show. As he is talking to his frog militia friends
- ADDITIONAL PLOT ELEMENTS TO TACKLE FOR CHAPTER ONE: Foreshadowing thought - Perhaps it was the President's motorcade that killed his parents. Have one of the pet shop owners be a really kind person and give Froggy some nagging thoughts against an all out war against the human race.


My plot outlines tend to be a lot longer than this, or the technological way (using an app that has special ordering)... another way is to design a plot flowchart. It's a very interesting method and, sometimes when I'm done doing it the way I normally do, I then draw up a flowchart much like the Princess Bride example used at this website: http://myliteraryquest.wordpress.com/2010/10/11/plot-flowcharts/

You have your assignment for this week. In the comments to this, tricks and links you have on creating plot outlines.

**SEPTEMBER CONTEST**

I got many good suggestions for a prompt for this month

*PROMPT* - Write a short story about a futuristic dystopian society. If you're unfamiliar with what dystopia means

*HELPFUL READING* - Good 'dystopian' books are classics like Nineteen Eighty Four, Brave New World. More modern examples are The Hunger Games, Wool (a personal favorite and a quick read. Plus Hugh Howey is a self published success.), Divergent. If you don't have the time to read these things, feel free to find plot breakdowns online.

*SUBMISSION GUIDELINES* - As with the previous contest, take any criticisms people make to help you if you wish.

*PRIZE* - Same prize as last month ($25 PP or Amazon Gift Card.) Also

Have fun and happy writing!

**OTHER NOTES FOR THE SUBREDDIT**

New tags to be added! To foster even more creativity and to help some of the newer writers out there

**[OT]** - Off Topic. This is for topics that are NOT prompts. Every now and again you may have a question about the community or need some help hashing out a story. Off Topic posts are meant only for things geared towards writing or questions about the community itself. We're just going to test out this tag and see if it works out well.

**[IC]** - In Character. This is for threads where you workshop a character and get a feel for it. Got a character for a story but you aren't fully sure how they might talk or act? Post a thread like [IC] I am a bard for the our king AMA. Make sure you post a few details about your world and allow us to act like we're in your world and we will ask questions of your character (and you respond in character.)

As we are testing these tags

**THE PODCAST**

It will be once a month. Hopefully the 15th of every month. That's the only update I have for now on that. Stay tuned.

Considering that the neighborhood possessed a quaint closeness, one could not be so wrong as to surmise that it wasn't.

Emily Burke, staring blankly at the empty chair opposite her, tightly grasping a coffee cup in her hands. Fixated on the silence that hung above her head and settled into every nook and cranny of her small home, she closed her eyes and assured herself that it would stay that way for the rest of the night.

Granted, surely there was nothing to be concerned with; like herself they were heavy sleepers, never stirring, always difficult to arouse in the morning. Heavy eyelids seemed to accompany this trait, constantly giving them the same strained, exhausted look that she possessed, no matter how much energy she had.

Instead of coming from some gene however, Emily sat at her table at 3am, drinking coffee and focusing on the silence that engulfed her house, waiting for it to be broken once again.

""Killer"" was not the first word to come to mind when one thought of Emily; aside from secrecy that shrouded the confines of her home, stealing her sleep.

Most of the blame she placed once again on genetics

Outwardly their marriage had appeared perfect

Quickly enough, shielding herself from pestering questions and locking the secret within.  

Running her fingers though her matted hair

She jumped as it began, so much screaming; she knew it all wasn't real, all prerecorded in her mind, but every noise was as vivid as the night it happened. Tonight was no different from the others, the same muffled grunts and scratching that grew louder with each step closer to the basement; she had to make sure they weren't real, that he was still as she had left him.

Until she reached the bottom of the stairs, rhyming grunt that escaped from the mouth of the door leading to the back of the basement. Vexed by the incessant noise and plagued by worry, she ripped open the door of the large, industrial freezer that lay in the back room.

Worry left her body in the form of tears as she saw him, mouth agape in a twisted scream, pleading for a mixture of forgiveness and air.

""X""s were strewn upon his skin, scrutinizing her as she stood, shivering and staring back into his with a similar frozen expression.

Yet another night was spent, just in case the neighbors heard, just in case it was real.

We are almost for 4k users. What I've enjoyed in particular this week was the ""continuing story"" prompt creation. Thanks to redditor kittyportals for starting the first one

That said

""[FF][CS] Cats eyes"" - Could be a prompt about the world through a cats eyes and replies can be no longer than

""[HP][RE] Hindenburg disaster"" - Could be a historical prompt that you outline with some sentences.

Tag talk aside, hopefully, a piece of cake. :)

In his honor, but only in the sense that you're not ""laughing with"" the author. The ""best"" aren't funny at all, but simply make you wince in vicarious embarrassment.

Let's dissect one of [many fine examples](http://www.bulwer-lytton.com/lyttony.html)

    For the first month of Ricardo and Felicity’s affair
    one another at every stolen rendezvous with a kiss - a lengthy
    ravenous kiss
    if she were a giant cage-mounted water bottle and he were the
    world’s thirstiest gerbil.

What makes this sentence a ""winner""?

* *Inconsistent diction and tone.* The words ""rendezvous"" and ""ravenous kiss"" should never appear anywhere near ""cage-mounted"" and ""gerbil"".
* *Strained metaphors.* There are a million things you can compare a kiss to. This shouldn't be one of them.
* *Numerous long asides.* This sentence managed to win with only one
* *Plausibly serious.* Probably the hardest quality to attain

**PROMPT:** Write your own winning entry to the Bulwer-Lytton Fiction contest. Your one sentence can be up to 100 words

1344988953.0,y8e00,[PI] The contract for my soul - 6:06 A.M.,disconomis,18,0,4,"Phillip grunted as he pulled himself onto his roof. With a couple of labored breaths he got to his feet and stood tall. The sky was an ever brightening shade of blue. He took a look at his watch

The next four minutes would be spent in crippling anxiety. It had been eleven years since it all happened. Eleven years since Sofia had begun to look at him differently. Eleven years of marriage, unaware of what was transpiring. He remembered that time, the waning days of college, the fresh exuberance that she looked at life with, and the consuming fear at what he thought awaited him. She was going to run off, start teaching abroad, follow the path of children who needed her. Phillip? Well, bow his head and accept the three-walled prison that would be a gray cubicle. Who knows, trying to get back to their rooms before midnight brought out all sorts of vagrants. He had been adamantly trying to accept his impending reality

“You really like her

“You’re walking away, never moving in the slightest. It was late, though, and Phillip really didn’t want to deal with anything the man had to say, even if it regarded what tortured him most. 

“Oh, but to anyone who bothers to look just a little bit harder…well…” Phillip was becoming agitated. If he could just get home, he could sleep and get past another day.  
“You’re so cold

“Come to think of it, regardless, right?” The man hit a nerve. Phillip was not in the mood for this. Not now, not ever.

“Leave me alone

“That’s no way to treat your best friend

“Who the hell are you

“I just told you, Sofia will be yours.” Even in the darkness, the teeth in his crooked grin caught some of the light, seemingly floating in the space in front of Phillip. He knew Sofia’s name, too? Phillip became defensive.

“Fuck off. Go bother someone else, somewhere, he believed what the man had said. He couldn’t remember anymore. He rounded the corner onto his block, pretending not to notice that the man was gleefully on his trail. The man hopped up on the low wall beside Phillip and began walking on it, carefully placing each foot in front of the other to keep his balance. 

“You doubt me. That’s completely understandable. Being so rude, ‘I doubt you, good sir’ or ‘I do not require your assistance in this matter, helpful old chap, but I shan’t soon forget this’ but nooooo, you called me an asshole.” The man in the suit suddenly flipped himself into a handstand and continued along the wall, to Phillip’s amazement. “You know

Phil caved and his shoulders slumped. “What do you want from me? I just want to get home and sleep, his question aimed at the universe more than the man. The man launched himself off the wall and landed with precision in front of Phillip, again, perfectly situated amongst the looming shadows of the nearby buildings.

“Yes, I’ll let you go if you allow me a simple demonstration. If, after you see my…talents, you still only seek the solace of sleep, I shall grant it. Deal?” He extended a hand out to Phillip in hopes of a handshake. The hand looked frailer than it should have been for a man his apparent age. Phillip looked at it and then back at the man. He nodded, the most approval he was willing to grant. The man rescinded his hand as a raspy chuckle escaped him. “Wonderful! I knew there was a reasonable man beneath that rugged exterior! Sit back and watch.” 

Back on the roof

The man quickly twisted his body around to face the intersection and outstretched his arms. He began to wiggle his fingers as a low laugh developed in his throat

“Here…”

Headlights appeared, stuck in a high pitched whine indicating unsafe speeds. Lucky guess, thought Phillip.

“it…”

Off to the side, also headed for the intersection. Much slower, the car seemed to be carrying two young women who were amidst laughter. Something got caught in Phillip’s throat. He felt a cold sweat break out on his neck as he began to see the possible outcomes of whatever the man appeared to be conjuring. He opened his mouth to say something, but the man beat him to it.

“comes!”

The car with the women entered the intersection and was immediately bathed in the headlights of the speeder. A split-second awareness of their unfortunate position preceded their car being t-boned in a horrific mesh of metal and sound that reverberated throughout the emptying streets. Complete dread filled Phillip’s stomach. The speeder kept a startling amount of momentum as the other car rolled violently down the street towards Phillip and the man. After a few more seconds of horrific crunching and grinding

“Excellent! My timing on these gets better and better. I guess what they say about practice is tr—“ Phillip burst into a sprint towards the wreckage. The man shook his head. “Still rude.”

Phillip ran up to the driver side window of the car with the women in it. He gagged as he realized he had difficulty seeing where metal ended and the women began. They writhed, completely desperate and uncertain on what he should do. The man in the suit joined him.

“Relax. It’s mostly aesthetic damage. That is

“Your proposal!? How did you do this!? I’m calling the police!” Phillip took out his phone. The man laughed.

“Yes

An ambulance that had been four blocks away had seen the collision and arrived on the scene. The paramedics scrambled out of the vehicle and approached the devastation.

“So, getting Sofia can’t be that hard, can it?” Phillip stared off, trying in vain to make sense of the last fifteen minutes of his life. He watched the paramedics pull the women from the car after confirming that the people in the speeding vehicle were only affected by non-life-threatening injuries. “I still don’t seem able to reach you. I’ll make it an even better deal, then. Accept my terms, and those two women get to live. Reject my offer…”

Both women were flatlining. Each had a paramedic working relentlessly to resuscitate, I chose you because I thought you weren’t a moron. Don’t prove me wrong, now. I’m offering you their lives AND Sofia. It’s a steal, you’re really raking me over the coals.”

""What do you want from me?” asked Phillip

“Something you weren’t even sure you had. Your soul.” Phillip tore his gaze from the destruction and looked the man in the eyes. He was now fully lit, but they were asinine.

“Are you kidding?” The man reached up and turned Phillip’s head towards the wreckage.

“Does this look like kidding?” The women still showed no signs of life. Phillip couldn’t change that

“Deal.”

“A man of the people! That would have gotten you far down the line, you couldn’t enjoy true love without a soul, could ya? And, just for good measure, I’ll let you pick the month and day when I do cash in. I still get to pick the year. Wouldn’t be much fun if I let you have all the freedom.” Phillip didn’t respond, his eyes still fixated on the scene before him. The man in the suit stared at him waiting for a reply. After a moment, he spoke again.

“You should take advantage of this offer; you really don’t want me picking the date.” More silence followed. “Nothing? Alright then

“No.” Phillip had faced the man again. A wide grin came over the man’s face.

“Ah

“You know damn well what’s wrong with it.” Phillip was stern and unforgiving.

“Oh my, that would have certainly put a damper on things. Good catch, Phil. The 15th, then?” Phillip returned to his silence. “The 15th it is! On August 15th, of a withheld year, I shall come fetch my part of the agreement. You’ll know of my arrival by the sunrise. If it rises at 6:06 AM, regardless of where you are, it doesn’t confuse people.” Another toothy grin decorated his face

“Just need a single signature on that dotted line. You have no idea how many lawyers I’ve got

Phillip stared at the document. He had resigned himself to his circumstances. He didn’t believe he was turning his soul over, this was all so realistic. But how? Impossible.

“Take too much longer and we might have to alter this deal. Look, motionless. The other paramedic still tried, his hands pushing down on the chest of the driver. No sign of life.

The anxiety swelled in Phillip’s chest again. He turned to ask the man for a pen and found he had already extended one to him. He snatched it and scribbled his name on the line. He threw the paper and pen on the ground and quickly stepped to the paramedics.

The man in the suit called out after him. “And don’t get any bright ideas

“Shock them again!” yelled Phillip. Both paramedics looked up

“Sir…” said the man who had stopped performing CPR.

“Shock them again!” He was on the verge of madness. The paramedics didn’t want another incident on their hands and

“Clear.” He said the words solemnly, and another. Phillip switched his gaze to the other paramedic.

“You! Now!” The other paramedic did the same, each wanting life more than the other. The paramedics turned to face Phillip.

“How…?”

Phillip turned around to find the man in the suit. His gaze rewarded him with nothing. No contract. No perfect red tie. No crooked smirk. Just an empty sidewalk. Behind him the paramedics dashed to the ambulance for stretchers as a fire truck and another ambulance arrived. Back on the roof

Phillip awoke the following morning in a haze, he returned his head to his pillow and stared at the ceiling, doing some computing of his own.

Even if the car crash had happened, and the fortunate location of the paramedics kept the events that transpired from being impossible, just unlikely. Maybe he had imagined the whole thing. He decided he would spend the entire day in, turning off his cell phone and just reserving the day for himself. 

His welcome screen greeted him. After a quick clacking of keys

He opened up his browser and went to the school’s site. There, were the words “Victims of Horrifying Wreck Defy Odds.” A strange cocktail of emotion afflicted Phillip. He was glad they had survived the night, but disappointed it had happened at all. He sighed loudly, almost loud enough to drown out the knock at his door.

He waited, a forced smile on her face.

“Sofia? Hi, why aren’t you in class?”

“I could ask you the same thing.” She laughed awkwardly and averted her gaze from Phillip. “Can I come in?”

“Yeah

“We need to talk.” Phillip stopped and slowly turned back around to face her. His mind was well aware of the deal he had signed just hours before. A healthy skepticism still resided in his mind

“Everything alright?” he asked with genuine concern.

“No. Well, mostly, but not everything.” She still couldn’t look him in the eyes.

“Come on

“Well…I guess I’ll just say what I’m feeling because…” She paused

“I think I love you.” Phillip felt like a sledgehammer had connected with his skull. He felt woozy, confused, and scared all at once. An image of the man in the suit flashed in his mind, quickly giving way to the fact that Sofia had just uttered the words he had played over and over in his head over the past three years. He fumbled around for his couch, needing something to relieve him of the burden of having to stand. He leaned on the armrest, never taking his eyes off of hers, which had finally found the courage to meet his.

He looked away and exhaled. He had been unaware that he had momentarily stopped breathing. His eyes unconsciously scanned the room as he tried to put words together. After a minute

""I love you

“No

“I know how you meant it, feeling more alive than he ever had.

Sofia decided against teaching abroad, all the while Sofia loved him unconditionally. Her teaching career never quite panned out. She opted instead to work in the public relations department of a pharmaceutical company, deftly dodging questions and lawsuits.

The two victims of the car crash had died a few months after his fateful night

After three years of failure, though, and that drove him crazy. She never blamed him for anything. Even in the spirals of depression that gripped Phillip, the awareness that whatever misery she had to put up with was a direct result of his deal with the man in the suit, she consoled him and tried to put his mind at ease. He sought release.

Eleven years later, felt she had failed him. Knowing he had caused this only created more guilt and distance between them. It was as vicious a cycle as could come to pass.

He had spent her entire birthday away from their home. He had hoped that disgraceful act of indecency would be the final memory she had of him. On the roof

He looked out at the horizon

“Come on, willing the sun to appear, exerting some sort of intangible force in desperation. The seconds ticked away, the horizon losing all trace of blueness, becoming engulfed in tones of warmth. The sun refused to make its entrance. He didn’t dare look at his watch.

“Come on

6:08. Two minutes had passed in his infinite wait. 

“Come on. Come on! COME ON!” He ripped off his watch and threw it off the roof. “Come on you son of a bitch

“Save her!” he bellowed from the depths of the damned soul he was forced to retain. The first rays of sunlight fell onto his face, animalistic howl rather than English. He collapsed entirely, clutching himself. A fall from the roof could certainly kill him, but he couldn’t escape what the man had yelled out to him at the end of their only interaction. Worse punishments than this? It was an unfathomable concept, but how could he doubt the man in the suit now?

Another year awaited him. It wouldn’t have been so bad if he didn’t have a soul. The sun broke free of the horizon entirely

- **Write character sheets for your antagonists.** Get to know them. Why are they the antagonist? What was their life like up until this point? What are their ultimate goals in the story?
- **Subplots.** The side stories that can keep a story entertaining. Maybe your characters are on a quest to defeat an evil orc, with all writing advice - you can throw anything out the window.)
- **Research**! Is your story about feudal Japan? Read everything you can on wikipedia! Is your story about England in the late 1800's? Go to news.google.com - they have archives from newspapers around the early 1800's to today! Whatever the case may be

The surrogate was fast and powerful

Interface.

Jason pulled up a schematic of his robotic body and studied it as he ran. He was searching for anything that might help him defend Amy. Suddenly

""You have to trust me

""Alright

Rerouting energy conduits and charging his capacitors to maximum he suddenly stopped and wheeled about

He turned towards the charging creature and held out his hand as a torrent of built up energy flowed from him. Blinding white bolts of pure death struck the creature in the head and enveloped it. It's body spasmed in pain as it fell to the ground

At the last second Jason ceased his assault and scooped Amy back up. He deftly stepped aside as the dead creature slid past them.

""Whew."" He said to her. ""That was close.""

""I knew you would save us."" She smiled. ""I didn't know robotic surrogates could even do that!""

""Me either."" replied Jason. ""Not until I tried it! Necessity is the mother of invention they say!""

Suddenly the trees at the edge of the forest crashed to the ground as the herd broke through and into the open. Hundreds of the creatures were now stampeding towards them. They were in danger of being trampled by something they hadn't even come up with a name for yet.

Jason ran.

Ahead was a canyon

Amy knew it too. She screamed.

His hand caught the far wall and smashed through the rock causing a shower of debris. They slid downwards several feet before he could halt their descent.

He heaved Amy upwards and over the rim of the canyon wall just as the rocks he was clinging to broke free

Amy landed hard

""Oh shit."" she whispered.

She turned to look around her. Shadows darted among the rocks. 

Jason found himself back at the remote selection menu. He snatched up the first available unit he found and bolted from the charging station. Amy was alone on the mountain. He had to get back there. Fast.

He ran outside and looked towards the Kestrel bays. None were in. 

Jason ran. He was much faster than any of the other vehicles anyway. He detoured through a repair bay

He sent out a wide broadcast message to any Kestrels close to the coordinates he sent. 

There was only one close enough to matter.

""Raven here Jason

""Amy is up in the mountains

""What the hell

Jason ran on.

Morgan wheeled in the air

He and Raven were soldiers. Both were enhanced with cybernetic augmentations that gave them outstanding strength

The dark creatures moved with feline grace. Vaguely reptilian in appearance, she was almost certain they could climb.  

Amy moved higher up into the rocks.

They moved towards her

Raven popped the canopy of the Kestrel as Morgan came in to land. She leaped out

""Great."" She muttered to herself

She landed in the midst of them. They hissed at her

Jason was again approaching the canyon. The herd was now complacent and grazing peacefully as he raced through them. He reached the canyon rim and jumped. Without Amy's added weight it was not difficult to make the distance.

Raven was a blur of motion and flashing steel. The creatures kept pace. They were fast! They moved like liquid around her. Her blade simply glanced off their armored skin

Morgan set the high powered sniper rifle on the rocks and took aim. He squeezed off a shot. The creature's head exploded in a cloud of red mist. 

""Gotcha!"" He yelled triumphantly.

The creatures all paused in their attack on Raven and looked his direction.

""Oh shit."" he said as he quickly cocked the weapon.

Moving as one

Jason suddenly landed between Morgan and the charging creatures

One of them hissed a warning at him and started to swish it's tail slowly back and forth. 

Jason spread his arms out before him

His entire body was enveloped in a gleaming aura. A fine web of glowing white plasma danced around his form.

He reached out towards them

""Holy shit!"" said Morgan

The creatures started backing away. They looked at one another uncertainly and then suddenly seeming to reach a decision

They fled from the power they perceived within him

Amy climbed down from her perch in the rocks as the energy dissipated from Jason's body. The glow had left him now. 

She approached cautiously.

""Is it safe now?"" she asked.

""Yes

She ran to him and wrapped her arms around him tightly

""I knew you would come back for me!""

In that moment

He wished that right now he could feel her body pressing against him.

Tell my little ones I love them

Was I brave? I doubt it. I never was brave. I know I died with my doubts the only thing still animated about me. I know. Even now Im not scared, and the neglect. You, a caged bird by choice. 

When we were young we took a trip to Burma, trying to protect her from rubble. She didn’t make it, but I guess in some ways she did, whatever that means. And we cried, and it was the first time I had cried in years. 

That’s why I wonder if I was brave. Did at any point I wake up and protect you from the rubble? 

I know I didn’t. 

I think I’m sorry Claire

I fear I am stuck somewhere old and dark; ancient. Where bones are gray and taut, with you, where we were young and pretty and green - sitting out on porches, under streetlights that burned orange in the dark like a sky full of stubborn suns, dying and fighting; kerosene in our veins, when we had mountains for teeth and we ran and sang so pretty and out of tune.

But I know I won’t be with you, quietly this time before it’s all gone, but I don’t have much hope for that and I never have.

----------

 “Serves ‘em right

“But they do.” Barty had served the Cloburn family for generations. His portrait never joined those of the bearers of the family name or the ash that each canvas became in time. His bust surely never joined those of the Cloburn patriarchs. Had Damian carried family pictures

Damian froze

“Tell me

“But, “they didn’t ask. They can’t ask. Whether they care to admit it or not, they need you. You are still their brother.”

That hurt. The guilt had been purged long ago, looking for a new alley to use.

“Damian Edward Cloburn!” shouted Barty whose hands had balled into fists. “I raised you as would have my own son. I cared for you as well as a man could care for a child. I was there when you took your first steps

“That name

The shouting of that fateful night echoed through his memory. He blinked and shook the images from his mind before continuing his retreat. Barty ran after

“Name or not

Damian looked into the old man’s eyes and saw the quivering irises

“Trust? What a joke… What do you need from me?” he resigned.

“Ten thousand

“Ten grand? Jesus!”

Barty was as puzzled as Damian was shocked. 

“Surely you have enough

Damian grimaced. He waved at the mounds of cardboard lining the walls of the alley

“Does it look like I have ten thousand dollars?!”

“B-but

“I never took a goddamned cent of their filthy money.”

Barty realized the mistake he had made. Damian wasn’t who he needed. But he was out of options.

“Is there nothing you can do?” he pled.

Damian still wore a bitter expression from the mere thought of helping himself to his siblings’ profits.

“Why not just sell their shit? They had plenty of it. Used to just throw away larger stacks than that.”

Barty wiped his brow.

“The bank seized the majority of the estate and ‘The Egg’ has the rest.”

Damian let loose exasperated laugh

“They’re too far gone to save

“I have to try

“You do

“They know about you

Damian’s outstretched fingers curled into fists. He didn’t need the barrel for heat.

He could run. He did it once before. Not far enough

“Dammit

“Happy

“Happier

“That’s all I ask

“Thanks

Once again alone, the lies, the drugs. He missed his old life. Before it went to hell, that is. As his memory caught up to Geoffrey standing naked, splashed with blood, standing over his beaten sister, he kicked over the barrel and curled into a ball against the cold bricks.

The hand on his shirt collar lifted him to his feet. The owner was 6’6” easy

“This way.”

Led by his collar, shining brilliantly. His eyes wandered up to see the round form of The Egg.

“Mr. Cloburn

Damian started to rise when the limo lurched forward

“Emma and Geoff owe you money.”

“The Cloburns owe. You are a Cloburn. Their debt is your debt.”

“So I’ve heard.”

The Egg smacked his lips before taking a sip of his drink.

“I get the impression you are not going to cooperate.”

“No

The scotch splashed off of the cubes as The Egg swirled his glass.

“You pay this debt

“Good. Now

Another sip. The glass was then placed in on a shelf by the window.

“I saw your residence.  Let’s just say I have trouble believing in your ability to pay up.”

“I said I’ll get your money

“Before you go

“Colla- I don’t have anything.”

The Egg snapped his fingers and the limo halted.

“Of course you do.”

Another snap and the doors opened on both sides. Large hands suspended on even larger arms pinned Damian to the rear of the seat with one hand covering his mouth. The Egg leaned forward and furnished a knife from a cocktail tray. As Damian struggled against the much stronger arms, the knife freed finger from hand while muffled screams filled the vehicle. The crime boss dangled the digit in front of Damian’s eyes for a moment before tossing it into an ice bucket.

“We’ll keep it safe until tomorrow. 5 pm. Right here

A muscular arm yanked Damian clear of the car and threw him onto the sidewalk. The impact on concrete barely dulled the intense pain of his down payment. It was only worsened when he started thinking about what took his finger from him. *Surely losing the family fortune was enough. Why did those idiots have to take up gambling

The repeated chants of how his brother and sister deserved what was coming to them made his heart race and the blood to pour out of the open wound. One of the other men in the alley came to Damian’s aid. He was a junkie with a strip of rubber tubing to use a tourniquet. Another took a spare bandana

“I’m calling it in

He blacked out, they saw some rich brat running away from home. But he was quick to help out, giving his thick wool coat to one of the youths and sharing his meager stash of food. It was clear before too long that he was there to stay. The panhandlers made decent money around the city, enough to feed themselves and help out their brothers in arms. Legions of displaced citizens sent what they could from hand to hand.

Damian stood in the bedroom door a much younger man. He had just arrived home and hadn’t yet removed his coat when the screams sent him running upstairs. The needles were spread across the floor as a wild Geoff, he froze.

“She’s just playing.”

Damian ran into the room and pulled the woman into his arms

“What the hell did you do to her?” he demanded.

Geoff waved his palms in front of him as he kicked the needles away

“We were just trying out the new shit. Wanted to see how good it was before it hit the streets.”

“Jesus

Damian was furious. Geoff had no place trying to deal and dragging Emma along for the ride was a step too far.

“Calm down

Emma started moving and her eyes rolled open. She looked up at Damian.

“Did you want a hit?” she slurred.

When Damian stood, head banging into the floor. He ignored their rambling as he walked to the front door. Barty was waiting. Their eyes met and Damian could see the guilt within.

“You knew?”

Tears streamed down the butler’s face.

“How long?” he questioned further.

“Five years

“And you never told me?”

“I thought they would stop. Forgive me

Damian walked past

“It’s not me who needs to forgive you. And don’t call me a Cloburn. I can’t stand to be associated with *that*.”

Barty's expression cracked a glimpse of something besides remorse. Almost a grin, that at least one of the children would be free of the storm ahead.

Even as a dream

“Ten thousand

“Thanks

The limo pulled up at the mouth of the alley.

“Long enough. Good luck out there.”

The others scattered, The Egg in his menacing rotund form waited, flanked by a pair of his thugs.

“You have something for me?” The Egg called out.

Damian collected the cash into a stack and held it up.

“Is it all there?” The Egg asked.

“Yeah. All ten grand. Every dollar needed to let my siblings go free.”

He lowered his arm

“What the hell do you think you’re doing?!” the crime boss shouted. “You’re dead! You hear me? Dead!”

Damian turned his back and walked further into the alley.

“Damian Cloburn’s been dead for years. Keep the finger. I was gonna give it to you anyway.”",,t5_2s3nb,1371579390.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/1gl668/pi_what_is_owed_july_contest/

But other than fear of not living up to expectations

That may be the real fear! Fear of being honest. Fear of opening up. It may be the fear that accompanies growth!

But anyway

I first recalled one of my own fears and wrote about it: 

Fear. Fear is something that plays a large role in my life. I’m mainly afraid of talking to women. We used to go out, but I couldn’t come aware of that. I didn’t move, and I was confused. And I was much afraid, maybe even on the verge of panicking. 

Then I ordered my fingers to type:

Boy

afraid

I’m trying to get myself laid

Fear

It’s unclear

but it’s here

lost in a storm

on the sea

in the midst of fear you get born

a haze before my eyes

my mind is telling me lies

I look away and the moment dies

fear why are you winning again?

it’s so easy behind my pen

situation is what separates boys from men

I think it’s behind me

Safely behind a cup of tea

But still I plea

Other self 

listen to this elf

don’t put your dream on a shelf

Your hope is my hope

We are tied by a long rope

I know you were only trying to cope

With the sand that people throw

in our eyes

that we have nowhere to go

but this place at this time

in this space and this rhyme

and this face

and a moment that fits on a dime.

-----------------------

I think I have potential as a poet, in order to help r/writing.

""I just think that we should be positive in all situations, Mort? Don't you get tired of complaining about squash vine borers and bacterial wilt?""

Mort sat silently trying to ignore Larry who had become a nuisance to those plants close by. It wasn't so much that Larry was factually wrong about embracing despondency

No one knew why Larry seemed so detached from some of life's bitter realities

The others guessed that maybe he had been mishandled as a baby hothouse. Others thought he never fully came to grips with many of his brothers' and sisters' flowers falling off early before fully blooming and coming to fruition. But Mort thought whatever damage had befallen Larry

""Mort

Mort had enough.

""Larry

""Wonder what happens to them?"" Larry interrupted with a frenzied laugh. ""Wonder what happens to them? I think you are just jealous of the other plants out here who get taken inside

""This is what I think happens, and plays games with them until it is time for bed each night. The fruit and vegetables on the inside wake up every day to glorious, exciting, indoor activities and wonderful house treats. It must be the life! No more rain. No more blazing sun. Luxury, Mort. Luxury I tell you.""

""Larry! Sit still and don't say anything! Just try to go unnoticed

""I hope he sees me! Then I can get picked up and taken inside with all our old friends, but I just need something more out of my life.""

At that moment Larry felt a warm but rough hand on his back. Old Man Tilly was picking him off of his vine! A thrill like nothing he had experienced shot through Larry's multilocular zones sending shivers through his seeds.

1346639198.0,z9d2v,[PI] Futuristic Dystopian Entry -- September Contest,Gorptastic,17,2,1,"Glory! Another fantastic day in Totalitarianland!

The patriotic sun shined its patriotic rays through the windows of my patriotic room. I yawned, with a tall orange glass of Sunshine Smiles. The Bureau of Happiness declared it a magnificent breakfast, fulfilling the quota of morning calories, vitamins, and minerals necessary for a productive working day.

After my patriotic breakfast, before then taking a hard left at Egalitarian Drive.

This week, excited to my core to try out being an orthopedic surgeon. The receptionist people greeted me, smiling from ear to ear after I scanned myself in. We shook our State-approved handshake, our fingers interwoven between each other to signify unity. I already knew in what office I would work, having pored over the job’s Operations Manual all night beforehand. Needless to say, I felt incredibly blessed and fortunate to perform great deeds for my fellow person!

For the day, complained patriotically of a sore thumb. Smiling from ear to ear, I informed her that she suffered from Lack of Happiness Disorder (LHD), and that the State has generously found a treatment for her condition. After patriotically tending to the necessary paperwork, I administered to her a vial of bright-orange liquid: Sunshine Smiles. Citing personal experience, I persuaded her to drink two patriotic tablespoons of the solution, twice per day. I scheduled a follow-up appointment for her next doctor, she took the vial and left the building.

My second patient said nothing, unpatriotic toothache. Again, thanks to reading my Operations Manual, I knew exactly the right treatment. I prescribed one vial of Sunshine Smiles to him. Smiling from ear to ear, he took the vial and left the building.

My third patient proved to behave most strangely! From the first time I saw him, smiling from ear to ear. The man, who couldn’t have looked any older than 0.75 or 0.8 Great Leaders, started babbling in tongues I could not understand. Looking back, I still cannot understand the guttural phrases issued forth from his unsmiling mouth. Clearly, the man was deranged, in special need of a large and patriotic dose of treatment. Thankfully, drew a vial of the liquid out of a white box

The man (who by now was shamefully calling himself “Grady”) refused the vial, I told him as I would tell a willful child. But this was a serious case. He tried to tear himself out of the restraints, but luckily I had the foresight to add an extra lock in the seat today. Gazing at this struggling, tormented figure before me, I couldn’t help but feel the greatest sense of pity. With tears forming in my People’s eyes, I buzzed the intercom for a nurse, and Number 6920913 appeared moments later. I instructed him to administer a patriotic dosage of Sunshine Smiles, I remember, hunching his back

The office closed promptly at 6th Master, and patients visited. I filled an invoice for another express delivery of vials, which should arrive the next day. By the time I had finished, I was the last person to leave the building; of course, the janitors would arrive soon, so I waited to hand them the keys to the office. I gave the State-approved handshake to Number 4185672, smiling from ear to ear as I gave her the keys. We documented the handshake, pulling out of the parking lot and back onto Egalitarian Drive.

The drive home featured fewer Dutymobiles than before, PTV played its feature program: Patriotic Television Nightly. Tonight’s featured guest was Number 2363422, author of the patriotic work *Patriotism and You: The State Guide to Happiness*. I had already read the book on multiple occasions, but I felt myself on the edge of my seat the whole time, hanging onto every word of this enlightened patriot.

After the program finished, Peace Broccoli, with a side dish of Tranquility rice and a tall glass of Sunshine Smiles. Smiling from ear to ear, I climbed into bed and fell asleep. 

Today was a fantastic, so I could do it all over again!

1345184495.0,yd5k4,[PI] August Contest: The Zinga Snare,bloodrosey,16,1,4,"Greisha slipped into the shadows when she first heard the human footsteps tramping through the woods.

""Grammy

""Because, older female voice.

Greisha stayed in the shadows as they passed. She knew humans believed that if you trapped a Zinga, when stepping into the shadows, can literally become a shadow. They lost their humanoid bodies and wings and became just the dark and the air in the shadow.

Humans had no qualms hunting the Zingas to near extinction. While the Zinga had humanoid bodies, and other bird-like features made the humans see them as little more than animals. Zingas had complex language and societies but it was hard for the humans to see that.  Their beaks made clicking sounds when they spoke, making it hard for a human to discern what was being said - the humans likened their speech to dolphin cries and assumed it was nothing more than emotional and guttural language.

Zingas didn't have cities or houses, a Zinga need only to slip into a shadow. In the shadow state, they felt no cold or warmth. They became creatures of pure intellect and emotion. They even mated in the shadows - quite literally becoming one as their shadow states melded. A child would grow out of their combined shadow selves and be born into the shadow.

Greisha had been taught when she was little to hide from the humans.  When she heard one, water, and sunlight like most other living creatures.

Greisha was on her own now - she hadn't seen another Zinga in a long time and longed for a mate or even just a friend. Without anyone around to hold her back

""Why do we need a live Zinga, the slower it got just like all of the other forest animals. This woman despite her obvious age was quite a mover.

""Silly girl

""But

The elderly woman stopped and turned to face the little one. She squatted down so that her face was at the same level as the young one. ""Fine

""I promise

""Well

The little girl's head bobbed up and down.

""The Zinga didn't escape

The little girl gasped. ""But pappy says we need them

""Your pappy sells the feathers off of the Zingas he's killed to stupid tourists. And since they don't actually do anything

""What does extinct mean?""

""It means, there won't be any more - ever again.""

""Oh

""Yes

""I'll be very

That sounded very nice to Greisha

The old woman pulled out a large miner's light and shone it at Greisha. Greisha stopped in her tracks and knelt on the forest floor, the 'me' came out to be 'e'.

The old woman seemed to understand and turned off her light. ""You heard all of that

Greisha nodded her head up and down - a way humans said 'yes' to one another.

The old woman walked towards Greisha

""Now

Greisha was taller than both the old woman and the young child and much more broadly built but she looked so weak as she walked along out of the forest. They left the forest and went to the old woman's farm. It made Greisha uneasy to be out of the forest. In the middle of open fields

The little girl was instructed to go inside the main house though she put up a fight over it

'We could remain in shadow

Greisha was so excited that she started to squawk and click her beak. She bobbed her head up and down and walked in place quite a few steps in front of the door. The old lady opened the door quickly and Greisha ran in head first. She was surprised to hear the door slam behind her. She was more surprised by the light

I found myself one day having to make the decision on where to go from there. I had nowhere to be, specifically. I never did. I was a natural born follower; everyday I would go through the motions, and nothing ever meant anything one way or the other. I figured that life was not pointless, just not a definite necessity worth wasting time over. I had better things to do than worry. My young mind was a Kerouacan wasteland of scattered thoughts and composed notions. 
	My bags were indifferently packed, and I accepted this. I figured the thought would come to me in a flash of spontaneous ingenuity, an ironic stroke of brilliance worthy of a cinematically stereotyped bad-boy, with crazy ideas and a supersized heart of limitless youth and excitement. Unfortunately, I was left with nothing, and my heart remained at its original ordinary size and stature. I walked on, into the overplayed stereotypically cinematic sunset. 
	However, the universe, and everything descended quickly, than gently, upon my very soul and being. It was a single second of confusion and certainty, of hopelessness and hope and the love of God and humanity and everything and anything. It was like no drug I have ever tried before or was willing to try again.
	I looked down upon my poor, almost out of pity. And I knew that I knew something – what it was, I may never know. But it was something. And I knew what I had to do it. 
	I walked on

**EDIT: Spacing**

-----------------------------


The bell sounded throughout the school and I carefully slipped into my desk. The teacher, as if we’d forget. She turns and smiles at us and I place my hand on my chin, glancing out the window.




“Today we’ll be starting out with a writing exercise. It’s simple




Twirling a pen in my fingers I gaze around the room while waiting for her next instruction. Having lived in a small town most of my life I knew almost all of these kids since we were in pre-school together.



Except the new girl. She was beautiful in a subtle way. Not the lime-light type, hallowed cheeks, and full lips. Light freckles sprinkled across the bridge of her nose and her cheeks. She was very quiet, observant and reserved girl. The most reaction I’ve seen out of her was a twitch of a smile when I said something funny or she enjoyed Mrs. Cunningham’s over exaggerated reactions. 




She is absent a lot




I don't know, Alex for short. I usually kept my hair semi-long, it flopping in my face as a wavy mess. I was told my hazel eyes were captivating, though I didn’t feel I was very much intriguing. Just a simple guy who enjoys his videogames, hanging out, and swimming. I don't get noticed by girls a whole lot, and only had 3 girlfriends in my entire life (1 of which was in middle school and lasted all of 3 weeks). Normally I take it upon myself to help out the new person but everything about this girl screamed **stay away!** She herself wasn’t off-putting, quiet voice she rarely used called for the message of *please just leave me alone.*




“I want everyone to think of an emotion, “it can be any emotion you like, maybe one you wish to work on like anger or sadness, or an emotion you enjoy feeling, like love and joy. I want you to give this emotion a life. Who is Joy’s parents? How did she become Joy? What is her personality? Her favorites? How does she look? Give this thought and write a maximum of 3 paragraphs. Begin!”




I glance over at the girl, intent. We write for 30 mins, and I felt pretty good at my attempt. Vivian was called first to read and I watch her lips move more than I listen when she stands up to read.




When she sits back down her sleeve rides up, fear, and sadness in them. All I heard was the rush of blood in my ears, and suddenly it all made sense. The days she came back she was extra careful to not let anyone touch her.



One time in English Mrs. Cunningham patted her on the back and Vivian flinched and gave a small yelp. During PE on the days she couldn’t make up any more excuses for dressing out, I didn’t believe it. This girl whom I’ve seen almost every day for months now was being abused at home, and took it out on herself, and not a single person notices.



This realization made me sick to my stomach and I suddenly couldn’t view the world straight. Who would hurt this beautiful talented girl? How could someone cause her so much pain she took it out on herself as well? God, and not noticing. We both lived such different lives but she went about her days at school as if everything was alright at home. It wasn't alright, and she may never be alright.",Prompt Inspired ,False,,t5_2s3nb,,http://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/1dok49/pi_one_life_two_stories/

-------------

**The Impossible Guards of Cygnus**

Dan Chase lit another smoker as he reclined in his office chair. The Hippilians were supposedly an inquisitive bunch

The robot by the door sprang to attention, and cresting atop a nearly symmetrical face. A pair of round sunglasses covered her eyes, but the glint of green was a dead giveaway that she wasn’t local. Between her thin, red lips was a finger of a long, white glove, formerly of her delicate hand holding out a familiar blue infocard.

Chase’s smoker nearly set his trousers on fire as it fell out of his open jaw. He quickly rubbed the smoldering end on a piece of the metal chair between his legs

“Evening

She pulled her shades lower down her narrow nose

“I hear you find things.”

Her voice was a wispy soprano. The words hung the air for a moment longer than they rightfully should.

“I’ve had my successes in that field. Looking for something in particular

“Molly. Just Molly. And it’s someone actually.” She pulled a picture from the front of her blouse and handed it to the detective. “Petra. My sister. She had been investigating the area around Cygnus when she disappeared.”

No more explanation needed. Cygnus was one of the many areas in the sector that were marked as Red Zones. Terraforming didn’t always take

He looked at the woman in the picture. The resemblance was uncanny. Eyes were different

“You’re aware of my rates?”

“Yes, after all.”

The only thing worse than a missing persons case in a Red Zone is a gorgeous client that can afford the full rate. While Chase pondered how best to allocate additional expenses to force a horizontal discount

“This should cover your expenses for the time being. I’ll be monitoring the account in case your funds run low.”

So much for that plan. Chase snatched the disk out of her hands.

“Okay

For many a detective, was particularly gifted in his field. His extensive network of contacts helped there, but he also had a knack for getting out of trouble.

His client turned to leave the office.

“One more thing

She kept walking

“You don’t. I’ll call you.”

As she left

--------------------

If there was any place to find information on a Red Zone mission, and a pilot. The last of those was hardest to come by. They were a tight knit crew, though, and if you had an in with one, you had them all.

The Ion Dive wasn’t your typical space-side bar. For starters

Chase didn’t have anything to fear

“Captain!” shouted a few.

He no longer served in the Corps, but ran into his fair share of them nonetheless. He was looking for one, in particular. The tall, dark-skinned beast of a man was one of the few to remain focused on his Recyche.

“Savage

“Blow it out your ass

“What was that for?”

Savage turned his head toward Chase.

“I heard about Tortina. You left her stranded on that moon for days.”

A mission gone south always leaves artifacts. Tortina was a more recent failure.

The detective placed his hands on the bar. As he did

“She knew the risks and she still deviated from the plan. She’s lucky I was able to make another pass and pick her up at all.”

It didn’t seem to change Savage’s mind.

“She came home safe

“Yeah

Finally

He continued

Chase pulled out the picture.

“Nice. Your new gal?”

“Case. Ran an op near Cygnus. Know anything?”

“One of these days

“What

“You’re just lucky I still kinda like you. Yeah, ‘cause that ship’s gone. Last beacon was two weeks ago.”

Chase was taking notes on a small memo pad, or Petra had strayed too far. Either way, it was a fair assessment that she wasn’t coming back. At least not on her own. 

“Last echo?”

“Cygnus. For once your info is right.”

Chase took a swig of the wretched swill

“Well? I take it you’re looking for flight out there?”

Chase grinned. “Well

“Oh

Chase furnished the credit disk and waved it enticingly.

“I have an open-ended credit disk that says otherwise.”

“I really hate you sometimes

The pilot grabbed the disk and fed it into his reader. He took what he thought was fair

----------

The speeder wasn’t the largest or most elegant ship at the station

As they approached the border

“We’re going silent.”

Chase would have been nervous if he didn’t trust his pilot that much. Savage was the only pilot he’d request back in the Corps. He could fly blindfolded if he had to

There was only the blackness of space out of the main window. Above

Savage switch the lights and computers back on. No sooner than he did

“What the hell is that

“What just happened

“No clue, fast. Prepare to eject!”

He could see the wasteland of Cygnus approaching rapidly. Savage pulled a lever by his seat. The soft pod formed around his seat as he pulled the helmet on his flight suit over his head. A final pull and the chair sank through the floor.

Chase pulled his lever and grabbed his helmet. A second pull, he braced for impact.

---------------

Chase awoke on a table. An altar to be exact. He could see the smoke from the landing zone rising avoe a small hill far enough away that he knew he had been moved. As he slowly gained consciousness, thankfully still in place.

The table rested outside about twenty meters from a cave entrance. As he turned to sit up, the lack of any footprints anywhere was starting to worry him.

He had to strategize. First step was to survey the ship to see if it could be salvaged. He looked around to check for signs of life

“Not broken

As he lumbered over the shallow hill, no signs of dragging. It simply vanished. Even for a rickety ship like the speeder, at least some of it should have survived. But there was nothing.

The only object of reference anywhere in the vicinity was the cave. The pain in his leg had started to dull, careful to remain silent.

As he approached an intersection of paths, poking his head out to catch a glimpse of the source. He had missed it, but the shadows were humanoid. Robots of some flavor. Robots meant there was a human nearby.

He got to his feet and sidled down the corridor to the path where they had crossed. In the distance

Another turn and he saw a brightly lit chamber. Hugging the wall

The gray sand on the ground was thicker in this room and he left footprints as he walked. As he reached but a few feet away from the doorway

“Petra?”

“Who are you? What are you doing here? How do you know my name?” she asked without leaving room for answer in between.

“Your sister sent me. I’m here to take you home. Come on

She shook her head in despair. “Too late

“What guards?”

He turned to see the empty room. Then he saw the dust shift. The sand rapidly piled up several feet into the air before returning a mass back to the ground

“Impossible.”

The grabbed the startled man and took him to an adjacent cell before fading into sand once more.

Chase stood up and walked towards the doorway. As he approached

------------

Chase inspected his room. A small hole in the wall joined his cell with Petra’s. He walked over and peered through. Petra had the same idea and they were staring at each other.

“How did you find me?” she asked.

“Your sister mentioned Cygnus. I came here and crash landed. I woke up on the table outside. My ship. It’s gone.”

“Mine

“That explains the ship.”

He remembered the radio.

“Wait

He pried open the handheld device and started poking around

“Found it.”

“What is that?”

“This signal is what tells them to form from the sand. If I can just counter it…”

He started pulling wires and resetting them inside the radio. It only took a few minutes for the former intelligence officer to wrap it up.

“Here goes nothing.”

He flipped a switch and walked to the door. And through it. No resistance. He ran over to Petra’s cell and urged her through. Taking her hand in his

“I can’t believe it

“Thank you. Now to get you off this planet. Molly’s probably can’t wait to hear the good news.”

Chase pulled the young woman’s arm as she came to a halt.

“Who’s Molly?”

The question hadn’t yet sunk in when he heard a familiar voice as they left cave entrance.

“Well done, clever.”

Standing just outside

“What are you doing here?” he asked.

“I can’t just let you leave here. You’re staying and that’s that.”

“I don’t think so

The thunk of hand on metal echoed on the stone walls.

“What the hell? Who are you? Really?”

The woman let out a deep chuckle.

“Surely someone as crafty as yourself has figured that out by now.”

As Chase nursed his hand

“I know you’re not a normal robot. You don’t need a signal to operate. You made it here on your own

He squeezed Petra’s hand again to confirm she was human.

“You’re an android. Part of the terraforming unit.”

“Bravo, though, are a bit newer. They need to be close to humans to live. Rather perfect arrangement if you ask me. They need humans and their orders are to guard them, so they have extra incentive. The last human died too quickly. This one is young and fertile, but the prospect of building a supply of humans was too good to pass. You two will stay here and breed, allowing us all to live here indefinitely.”

“No dice

“But why not? You’ll have a comfortable room

“And I’ll be a prisoner. That just doesn’t sit well with me. And besides

“And just how do you expect to do that?”

He held out the radio disruptor.

“I only need to get past you. Those guards of yours can’t help you.”

As he finished his statement

“What’s the matter

Chase pulled a cover off the rear of the device. The indicator on the battery read zero charge. The sand behind them formed into a wall of guards. They were surrounded.

“Time to head back inside

A brief flash became a fresh battery which Chase caught and quickly restored power to the radio dropping the guards to dust.

“Miss me?” asked Savage

“If I weren’t afraid of disease

“Ooh

“Plaything? Missy

“It’s Molly you cretin.”

The blast from the laser pistol removed her head.

“Don’t correct me.”

----------

Molly’s ship wasn’t quite the speeder, pressing her lips tenderly to his.

Savage shrugged. “What

“Thank you

“You know, fed you, and have you breed with this pretty thing. Why didn’t you just stay?”

Chase’s smile vanished

The Corporal passed through twilight's eye, leaving the second sun's scant red rays to intersect with the waning first sun's golden cob.  He left the sidewalk for a field of tended grass, the spongy soil a welcome sensation beneath his feet. In the distance, a little girl played alone on a merry-go-round. He hastened his pace, crossing the grassy field to reach her.

Maya.  She could be no one else.  Tact painted geometric figures in his peripheral vision, most important, his own threat variance. But, Tact offered no algorithmic fact or analysis about the girl.  The AI embedded in the combat chassis welding his skull and spine had plenty to say about everything else, just not the girl.  She was Maya.  That statement flowed logically through the patchwork mess of brains and machine, and he knew, felt in the heart the medic had butchered from a fallen soldier and patched into his chest

Around she went, brain spattered across the tile, Maya had been there to beckon him home.  She made one more trip around the toy, leaped to the grass, and ran towards him.

Daddy, spun around once and embraced her close.  Her fur-trimmed hood pressed against his forehead, and he kissed her rosy cheek.   Daddy, he thought he heard her say. He squeezed her against his chest, shared with her the heat radiating from his heart.

""Maya.""  And Tact had nothing to say about it.  Why would it?  All of the hieroglyphs glowed amber from here to the horizon

She tilted her head away from his shoulder, he thought she said.  She embraced him still, rubbed her fingers over the protruding exoskeleton reinforcing his arms, touched the dirtied and bloodied cloth draped over the molded chest armor.

""Maya

As he spoke, watched his lips move, followed the craggy lines up his scarred cheek to the wrinkles around his eyes. Her smile waned, and momentarily he thought she would cry.  All expression left her face.

""You can't be my daddy anymore.""

""Maya

She planted her palms on his chest and pushed herself away.  Gently, her mirrored irises narrowed.

His wife, along with Maya, had beseeched his return, strode across the park.  Lithe and athletic legs, carbon fiber flexing and bending as though organic, carried her at a brisk clip.  

""Put her down

The girl tapped the gun barrel against his armored chest

""Oh

""As I was saying

""Maya -""

""That is not my designation

He lowered her to the grass

She spoke, yellow, and green.  The woman circled to her daughter's side, giving him a wide berth.

""Remember what I told you about showing status lights in public

""Oops

""No

She guided the girl to step away from the Corporal, and he may broadcast your dad's serial number, and he may wear your father's hardware.""  She pointed at his exposed fleshy cheeks.  ""But his model is incorrect.""

""I don't understand

""He's an illegitimate copy. Shoot him.""

No pause.  No consideration.  The girl didn't adjust the pistol except to pull the trigger. The gauss round's battery case cleared the ejection port at the same moment the round struck his sternum in a crevice between the armor plates.  It was a well-calculated shot.  The round punctured reinforced fabric, damp on his forehead and cheeks, the dirt gritty and acidic on his lips.  He clamped his right hand over the wound, and grabbed a mound of posies in his left, pushed himself up to a kneeling position.

Blood, pumped through his fingers. Tact didn't know what to do with it except analyze the temperature, rate of flow, and contents.  It offered a little orange flare attached to his bloodied hand, foreign words, numbers, and a chemical symbol.  Apparently he was iron-deficient.   While Tact figured out what was happening, his left hand still clenched around the clump of posies, maybe fate had intended him to live so that he might die here and now at his daughter's hand.

He offered the posies to the girl.  ""I love you

""Daddy

He opened his eyes, across the park, he saw another girl, the girl who had beckoned him back from the brink of death, holding a woman's hand.

She waved.  ""Daddy

This was logical according to the mishmash of brain tissue and machine mind.  Once again

He glanced at the child's face and eyes, don't shoot.  My wife and daughter are right over there.""

He hadn't meant his claim to be a distraction, they wouldn't have to.  Nonetheless, the child had not yet pulled the trigger, and that gave Tact time to recollect itself.  He suspected it didn't know what to do with an organic wound, compounded by the sudden change in tactical position.  Both had entered the town as friendlies, but in the blink of a machine child's metallic eye, they were painted hostile. Tact filled his vision with status updates.  It painted a diagram while instructing the exoskeleton to spear his spine and lungs, the needle may as well have been red-hot shrapnel in his back and the liquid acid vomited into the wound.  

Hieroglyphs pranced around the girl, weight, estimated reaction times.  Sequences iterated alongside ghosted images, stopping at a probable match, and painting her contorted silhouette. Tact raised some kind of alarm, and the entire grid flared hostile.  Moments before the park had been empty save her and him, the horizon a slim band of sunset and shadows augmented with Tact's amber waves of friendliness.  Now

He took the pistol from her hand.  It was easy.  She wasn't expecting it

""No, and Tact made it clear in that accursed alien hieroglyphic language he was making a tactical mistake.

“How will we start the fire then?” I asked

“No.” he answered. “We are going to use magic.”

“Magic? Magic is make believe!” I laughed. I thought he was just kidding with me. I would find out soon enough that he was serious. Very serious.

He put his finger to my forehead and punctuated each word with a light tap. “Clear your mind.” He said quietly. He looked around to make sure nobody was watching us and held up a stick. “Magic is based on thoughts that form images in your mind. You must use that image to project that thought into being. Use your hands to concentrate and direct your thought.”

Apologies. I suppose that only meant something if you knew that Francis Elkhart passed away that very month, he wrote the most important words he’d ever put to paper.

But that’s getting ahead of ourselves. As I said

----------

Randy Willow sifted through the review bin in the Greenville post office. The complicated computers that read and sorted the countless envelopes lacked the ability to read intent. Those missives that were not properly marked or lacked postage were dumped to a bin for a more organic approach.

The stack was small this evening. A few bills were printed askew so the address wasn’t visible through the window provided. Someone put a check between the labeled portion and the window. Finally

In reality

The air conditioning in the post office was out of order

As the conveyors turned in the back of the building, the ink smeared over top a Shoebox logo. It fell into a tray of mail already sorted for their intended travels. The box would depart for Kingston in the morning with the addition of a stowaway.

-------

Gloria Henderson woke up in time to preempt the pre-dawn alarm. Mitchell was a light sleeper and would have surely stirred were the buzzing to pierce the morning. Gloria thought it best he keep sleeping.

Suspended by a hanger on her closet door were her closest friends: a set of jogging clothes she had treated herself to the previous year on the eve of her 23rd birthday. She loved the juxtaposition of the tightness of the leggings and the looseness of the outer layers. She loved the way that the mildly stretchy fabric was warm in the winter and cool in the summer. Mostly

Her route took her down by the elementary school, through a stretch of sparse woodland, and to the park on the other side. The park had dedicated running paths, but Gloria had already run. Instead, the benches were her priority. One in particular.

Its back to a pair of caged basketball courts, a truck bearing “U.S. Mail” waited for a portion of its contents to stay behind. Only one tray made it off of the truck this morning. It was going to be a slow day.

As the mail truck pulled away, and hung her sweaty clothes up in the closet, just inches away from the black bag in which stayed a decorative white dress still waiting for the big day.

It was a big day, sorting the unsortable mail. But she found an incoming letter where the address had been torn off.  The return address was none too clear, either. As she normally did in these situations, she tossed the envelope into the abandoned letters bin and continued sorting.

-------

Gloria Kitscher woke up to the post-dawn alarm on a Friday morning. Mitchell, they were placed back into the closet, suspended behind the aging wedding gown, mixed in with the other clothing marked for donation. Her uniform was what her arm reached for. The hook gave way and the hanger fell, clacking against others on its journey downward.

Mitchell bolted upright.

“Dammit

“Sorry

She left the hanger on the floor when she finished removing the postal service shirt from it. As she worked the final buttons, something to add a little spending money to her purse.

It was a slow day. Kingston had avoided the boom that hit towns closer to the cities. The computerized systems were good enough to keep her labor limited. So Gloria pored through the bins of abandoned mail

Her hand found a familiar cream-colored envelope that had been stripped of its addresses. Upon closer examination, this one still had a chance. Almost without thinking, she stuffed it into her handbag to examine later.

In the comfort of her own home

But what if it was? The city was a good start, certainly. And there was. Of a sort. “My darling Katie” was written on the top fold of a piece of paper. Gloria unfolded the sheet to see the full name.

But it wasn’t there. In fact

“’The right’ what?” Gloria asked herself. For the second time that day

“You never watched to the right”

There had to be more, envelope, and her keys.

---------

The post office in Greenville had already closed for the day

While Gloria may have bemoaned the increased role of computers in the post office

The scanned copies made some of the writing hard to read, hoping he was still local.

-------------

Herman Brassart had bought the house when he got his first promotion. He had hoped his children would inherit it when he passed

A woman, but she was dressed like a postman.

“Who is it?” he called out through the closed door.

“Herman Brassart? My name is Gloria

“I don’t write letters

Gloria wasn’t giving up that easily.

“Maybe you don’t now

Herman thought this woman to be worryingly persistent. Regardless

“It was for Katie

Gloria stared at the door for a few moments in silence before turning away. The sliding of locks turned her back around.

“Did you say Katie?”

Herman had been retired for several years and his sagging skin suggested he may have waited longer than he had to.  There was a vacancy in Herman’s eyes as he retreated into the flooding memories. The stern face receded into a calm smile.

“Come inside

The door was left open. Gloria stepped inside

“Who was Katie?” Gloria asked to break the silence.

Herman kept his attention focused on the paper

“Just a young lady I knew at a time. Went to our church. I’d see her on the bus each morning. Same seat every time: driver’s side, every once in a while, she’d look up and out the window. Part of me hoped she’d look my way.”

Herman paused as he watched her turning to her right.

“I don’t know, she’d want to keep looking. I always wanted to tell her that. I just didn’t know how.”

He waved the note in the air for punctuation.

“When she never responded or looked up

Katie was bitten by the whimsy of the old man’s tale. Herman

“So that’s what it means

“What what means?”

“Your letter.”

“Huh?” the man muttered as he opened the note. “No

“Wrong?” asked Gloria. “How so?”

“This letter isn’t mine. I never wrote this.”

“No

“I may be old

Gloria still shook her head and pulled out her printed map.

“But you were the only one in the right zip code whose name ended in RT. It has to be you.”

“Let me see that

He pointed at a spot on the map

“Grey? I don’t understand.”

“Grey moved in there Fall of ’98. Start of a school year

Gloria could see the faint outline of an erased name hidden under “Grey.” It wasn’t legible

“Frank Elkhart wrote that

“Where’s Frank now?”

Herman rubbed his forehead.

“He passed away. That’s why the house was empty.""

Gloria’s head fell. She sat there staring at her knees.

“I’m too late

“Late? Even if you got that letter when it was sent it’d be too late. Frank died in July of ’98.”

“So this whole thing has been a waste?!” Gloria shouted as she brushed her eye

She clumsily rose to her feet and strode to her car in a rush. She hadn’t noticed that Herman had gotten up to follow.

“You know

Gloria already had half of her body in her car with the door nearly closed. Herman walked down to the bottom step and sat down. He wasn’t staring at Gloria

“I never watched the right

Herman caressed a perennial tenderly in his hand.

“Those ones at the park in particular. She’d visit the park sometimes. Probably would have seen her there a few times if I paid any attention. I was always so caught up on the girl to my left

As Herman’s tears left his cheek

“Gloria?” he asked in a panic. “Where are you?”

Gloria pulled the phone away from her ear to check the time. It was nearly 7. She hadn’t planned on staying in Greenville nearly that long.

“I’m out in Greenville. I was just getting ready to head home.”

“Greenville?!” huffed Mitchell incredulously. “What the hell are you doing out there?”

“I’ll explain later. I’ll see you in about an hour.”

Gloria didn’t wait for a response before hanging up the phone. She stood up and looked at Herman with a sorrowful gaze.

“It’s alright

“I’m sorry I raised your hopes like that.”

“For years, but the message might have been for me, too.”

Gloria reached down and gave Herman a hug and a light peck on the cheek before tearfully smiling

She neared the highway when she pulled off into a gas station parking lot. She pulled out her phone and started searching for the whereabouts of Katie Elkhart. There was only one hit in the region, OH. Vernon lived up north in Highland.  The red lights of her dashboard clock suggested she turn right to resume her quest in the morning. But, when she returned to the road, she turned north.

------------

Gloria didn’t have an exact address or an open post office to consult. None of that stopped her on the road to Highland. The advantage of a small town was that folks still had need for things like phone books. The days of phone booths with the tomes dangling by a cable were gone

The grass at 1210 F Street was sufficiently high to suggest that the owners had been away for awhile. Surely, but no Vernon. Victoria and Velma were present, as was “V Monroe.” With no other options, Gloria entered the address into her phone and headed straight there. 

It was nearly eight, her phone signaled the arrival of a text message.

*Where are you? Call me ASAP.*

She started a reply

“Hello?” asked the man with long brown hair that reached past his shoulders and a tall body confined to a wheelchair. “Can I help you?”

She struggled to find words. As they finally arrived

“Miss?” the man asked.

“Sorry

“What’s this about?”

Gloria fumbled around for the letter, and about his story. She continued about tracking him down in search for Katie, hoping that the letter had finally made it the final steps.

The man shook his head.

“No

Gloria found herself at another failed meeting. She started sobbing. Vince put his hands on her shoulders. As she wept

“There there

In its fall

“Twenty three years

“Y-yes

“Funny how things work.”

“What do you mean by that?” asked the woman

“I lost the use of my legs back in the summer of ’98. I was just a kid out riding my bike

“And it came from the right?”

“Sure did. To think

Even if it would have taken a major error to have made that happen

“All the same it didn’t though

Gloria’s phone beeped again. She pulled it from her pocket to see that the battery had run out.

“Shit

“Oh, I’m sorry I can’t help you. But I hope that letter gets to where it needs to be. You’re doing something good, I hope you know that.”

It was a reassuring thought

“Thanks

She said her goodbyes and returned to her car. No phone or even radio

------------

It was well past ten when Gloria walked through the front door of her home

‘Sleeping. All I ever see from you these days

She was exhausted, the letter flashed in her mind. As it did, her eyes drifted right and down to her husband. There was more than just a perspiring glass and liquor bottle in front of him. The first thing she noticed was the phone, face up with no signs of life. Its battery had died. His tablet was also out.

She stepped closer. There were several sheets of paper with scribbling:  
*Vince Monroe*  
*Letter - what letter?*  
*Vernon Monroe*  
*Katie Elkhart Monroe*  
*Frank Elkhart  (Francis)*  
*1998 - July*  
*Greenville

“How?” Gloria asked quietly.

Her phone. She had accidentally picked up the phone rather than dismissing the call. Mitchell had been listening in to the conversation, the phrase “granddaughter Katherine” had been circled.

A small light by the tablet’s screen blinked

She returned her attention to her husband. Tucked under his right hand was another slip of paper. It was an address

“Love you, never truly rising from his slumber.

“I know

Gloria went to the bedroom to change her clothes. Her jogging outfit was hanging from the closet door

Back in the dining room, fixing it with a single stamp.

Her mind had been fixated on discovering the meaning of those words, what it meant to her. Time had started to weather her relationship with Mitchell. She thought he stopped caring. But Mitchell did care. Gloria just kept missing the little acts he’d do. She never watched the right signs; never saw how much he really loved her.

Her eyelids were growing heavy

------------

Katie loved summer. Until she started school, though. She was going to visit her grandpa. He used to drive out himself, but it had been a few months since his last visit. And even then, he just coughed a lot.

Grandpa Frank was standing on his porch when they arrived. Katie, she eagerly held out a quarter.

“Oh

He gave the coin a close inspection

“I don’t know

“Aww. Come on Grandpa

“Hm. Well

He tightened his left fist around the coin. He flicked it into the air with his thumb and caught it again.

“Doesn’t seem to work.”

“One more try

“Alright

He used his arm to give the coin additional height. He traced its arc and used both of his hands as a bowl to catch it. But when he held out his hand to return the quarter

“It worked!” Katie exclaimed.

“It always does.”

“You have to tell me how you do that

Francis’s smile drooped by a fraction. Not enough for the girl to notice

“I’ll tell you what. The magic doesn’t work if you spill the secret. So I’ll mail you how it’s done. How’s about that?”

“Thanks, giving Francis another hug.

“You’re welcome, not letting go.

-----------

It sounds simple, turning one thing into four. Whether it is one quarter into a full dollar or one letter into four messages, not everyone can accomplish that feat. It may not have been intended, but the best things in life rarely are. If you were wanting to know how the story truly ends, how Katie reacted having the trick finally revealed, I’m afraid you’ll have to leave disappointed. I could conceivably send the rest by post, if you are so daring. But I’ll remind you that this was never Katie’s story. This, was a story about a message.",t5_2s3nb,True

1370056557.0,1fg26l,[WP] The first thing that comes to mind,youresuchadorkvic,12,2,6,"Prompt: Everybody thinks differently, or whatever you choose that comes to mind.)

There I am, hoping that it will rain. I have stubble, shorter hair, and I”m wearing a grey jacket. I pull out a black lighter from my left pocket, and a pack of smokes from my jacket. I look at my feet, then focus at my hands. I smile. I even laugh a little. With the cigarette in my mouth, I light. I inhale slowly. Then release.

Eyes closed., white shirt, blue jeans. No smokes this time. The sky is blue. The sun is out. So why am I wearing a jacket? I close my eyes again, and I’m standing at the edge of a familiar cliff. I see the city, the water, I can feel the morning. I can see the sun peeking past the clouds, the skyline so close, but amazing.

I throw my pack of smokes off the cliff, and I light. I flick the light on out of habit, and I stop. How many times this goes on for, well, I don’t konw. I just keep doing it until the fluid dies out. I shiver. It’s cold.

When did it become night time? I didn’t realize that the moon was full, and I smile.

My phone rings. I sit up. Disheveled, I notice: light hasn’t peekdd through yet. Oh, I hope for rain. I answer the call, as I lie in bed, and I say, “Hello?”

I don’t hear a voice

Dejected, I make a cup of coffee, grab the paper outside, and I sit on the porch. Again, I’m alone. The sounds of morning come into my ears as I become aware with each sip of elixir.

“Maybe I should have made an Irish Coffee…”

Things fade away. It’s just a white room. I can’t see anything past. Nothing ahead. I’m sitting

I laugh manically. I am happy. There’s this joy in my heart that fills up, is a canvas. It’s alonely. It’s white. It’s bland. But I’m happy.

Faces light up on the canvas of my mind. Each face on a screen next to a screen next to a screen. I blink. Each video plays. each memory plays over. Every sound of every memory is playing all at once. The people I don’t care about, I space out. Anywhere and everywhere that my body is, I hear it. I hear these sounds. I can hear everything at once,s sometimes one thing louder than the rest, sometimes the sound of my own voice talking to myself, and sometimes… nothing at all. Sometimes, I’m back at the cliff, or the roof.

Sometimes, I’m talking. Talking to nobody.

I’m always talking to nobody.

_____________________________________________________________

An entire year had passed. Rosie's sister had her first child in late June. Her grandfather had had his 91st birthday in September and back in February her parents had been married for 35 years.

In all that time Rosie had stayed in her apartment, but so very loved.

Every day she wept. A single year of marriage.

*The first year's the hardest

So much of that time had been spent arguing. Rosie recalled the times she thought they'd made a mistake. She couldn't stand him leaving dishes everywhere, and they'd made up and loved so passionately.

Everything Rosie was had been centered around him. He was her life. When he was gone Rosie panicked. In all of the entire world there was nothing left for her. In all of the universe there was nowhere Rosie belonged

The moment he left this world Rosie ceased to exist.

An entire year has passed. Despite Rosie's family, ultimately a decision had to be made, and the decision was hers alone. Rosie could give up, she could very easily let her twenty-one years of life go to waste and allow herself to slip quietly away.

Or Rosie could move forward.

The expanse of the future terrified her. She was empty, people were aging, and the sun still rose in the mornings.

Today, she cries out with the pain, and then... nothing.

The sadness gives way to peace. He's gone now

A Moment in Time Through The Senses: March 9

.
.
.

SIGHT

I am sitting in Danny's living room, stationary supplies that Danny NEEDED to have, letters and cards we've sent to each other, empty jars that I have been collecting, photos from both of our families. The television sits in front of us, playing a movie as usual. Dan wanted to watch War Horse, which has been pretty good so far. Under the television, alongside a few chocolate and marshmallow roses Danny has given me this year. He is sitting on the chair to my right

.
.
.

HEARING

I hear Danny flipping through the D&amp;D book that he's using to write up his game and charts. His fingers are tapping away at his keyboard, thinking about what he wants to put in his game and how he wants to write that up. My own fingers are tap tap tapping away at the keyboard laptop in my lap, quickly going over the letters to write up my journal entry as quick as possible. On the television, War Horse is finishing up, no dialogue but the theme music is slow, steady and lulling. Music for a happy ending by the music writer John Williams. Dan is making fun of the movie as the music swells on it's final scene, saying stuff like: ""You thought I was crazy, ma? But I'm back and I've got a horse, ""Yay

""It's okay Danny

He sniffles

I sarcastically reply


.
.
.

SMELL

I have never had much of a sense of smell, it lays on our bed and both our scents make it onto the fabric. I also smell Shilo's litter box a bit, mostly because I have to clean it and I have been pretty lazy with most of the housework. On the weekends, I don't do much since it's my days off from being the housewife, cook and maid. I think I smell eggs as well because Danny made us deviled eggs a little while ago and the house still smells like our meal. I think it also smells a bit like smoke because our boiler just had a problem a few weeks ago and there is still soot covering all of our walls. Someday I'm going to have to wash that off, but for the most part the house smells a lot cleaner and humane than the home I left far behind when I moved out of my parent's house. I'm grateful for the lack of smell these days. 

.
.
.

TOUCH

My legs are asleep at the moment because I've been sitting indian style for so long. They are all pins and needle-y up to the knees, I use a blanket between us, but it still gets rather hot. It might not be so bad if I could get myself to wear pants, but these days I usually only wear a shirt for most of the time. Moving upward, my stomach is a little achy because it's the first day of my period, and I'm PMSy. I was really bad this morning, but it seems to have subsided a bit. My back is also aching. It feels like shit lately and I'm going to have to get back to the gym soon or my muscles are going to completely atrophy. My shirt is scratchy on my back. My armpits are sticky and I could use a shower. My hair and scalp are so dry and yet greasy. Really not the best statement I could be making with myself. My eyes feel heavy even though I've gotten a decent amount of sleep. I haven't been sleeping too well

Its heavy clouds were abreast the gentle blue of summer and the bodies of battered buildings crawled across the stone streets with their shadows. Presently, sharpened on the small procession of stones

He remembered that Sgt. Miles had called it thunderstorm, the noise of thunder meant that one should find themselves behind cover. So he sat, an uneasy grin on his face, beside him Pvt. Strawther prostrate in grotesque offering to his murderer. The solemnity of the silence forced his smile, this outranked the quiet Sundays he often spent in church, eyes closed in prayer before he heard his name. 

Alex’s attention wandered to a window blemishing the cold face of a building sitting squat at the end of the street. The darkness of the stone hands that lifted it high above them wassuddenly betrayed by a sharp glint of steel. Thunder struck first in this instance, the clenched fist falling, a gesture of his end. Clasped fingers urged him out of cover to draw fire, Sgt. Miles was ferrying him to his death.

Still watching the window, blue like the sky was now.  He watched as another plume of smoke and dust exploded from a shot fired towards the window. The hand gestured again, calling him to move. He relished the waking moment he spent with her and the sky, then a voice ushered him back into his nightmare. He edged himself across the wall, its coarse embrace reminding him of the unusual sensation of first. The first ice cream he ever had, the first knee scrape, the first kiss, his legs carrying him out into the gaping maw of the street. He ran on

Lightning struck first in this instance, he struggled to breathe through the scarlet mess that heavily caked his face. He clasped his fingers around his nose as a final prayer for salvation. His other hand moved hastily to his neck, clawing and squeezing his throat. Fingers clenched, he pressed himself up and retched from the blood and saliva that overwhelmed his mouth. The air grew heavier and he struggled to simply hold his body up. He fell even harder. Bones crushed beneath his sternum, his fingers unable to escape the looming torso that fell atop them. The sound was sickening, the pain blaring, and the metallic taste of blood strangled him. The perverse grasp of unconsciousness eased in from the corners of his eyes. The sensations in his body deepened towards a final symphony,  before it became fainter. Slowly the quivers of his body and the tinges of pain dissipated until it became quiet. This distorted unknown emotion was nauseating and his mind drifted into the dark corridors of dread. He was unsure of this fleeting sensation; he had never felt it before but essentially he knew.

Then there was the living room, where my only son took his first steps. The walls were still a pasty, tan colour, with the stain-covered marble island and the dusty tiles, it was also there where I discovered that there would be no more warm meals, where he would stay for days without showing his face. It was there where I found him in his darkest hour

There had always been something odd about Adam's bathroom mirror. When he'd moved into the apartment, Adam was unlikely to win awards for alertness. Perhaps today was an exception, because he noticed that the scratches on the mirror were all in the same direction. Probably nothing.

Adam kicked himself awake with an espresso on his way to work. The marks on his mirror were playing on his mind a little: all of them in the same direction, if they thought they'd get away with it; Adam would have to get in touch with the landlord.

==

He walked back home during lunch, in the interests of neighbourly fraternity.

""So

""I thought you'd never get around to asking

As they both stood in Adam's bathroom, as he stayed close to the mirror while speaking.

""He was a strange one, and something always seemed a little... off, if you know what I mean.""

""No idea what you mean

""Mm

""Right

""Yah

==

Adam didn't get much work done after lunch. He mulled over what this ""Mr Ryan"" could've meant by a message in the mirror

""Delivery for Mr Clark?""

""Er, and was now presenting a parcel. As Adam looked up, the messenger was scanning a barcode from one of the labels plastered on the box: a short beep later, he was asked for a signature.

As the messenger left

""A barcode? Nah...""

As evening came, and was now rubbing a pencil over it to try transferring the ridges from the mirror underneath. Surprisingly, the lines were coming through quite well: faint in places, but he could draw them up into something usable.

With a completed transfer on the coffee table, a little craziness was fine: if the barcode didn't scan that would be the end of it.

“No! You fucking haven’t! You’re a real fucking person, and real fucking people that you knew and loved, and they fucking stole it from you! Now what the fuck is your name!”

1376661892.0,1khky9,[PI] I Guess - August Contest,packos130,11,0,0,"My father gave me two pieces of advice when I was young: Never lie

I was never very good at following advice.

But we’ll get to that later. Right now

I’ve been going to college for the past three years, I worked hard to get there, and I’m doing my damnedest to earn this degree if it kills me. I’ve loved biology since I was like 4 years old or something like that. Maybe it was six. Who cares.

Anyway. Mom’s paying for my college right now, so I guess I’m paying, but it’s her money, so she’s my sponsor. I guess.

So… yeah. That’s what’s going on with me right now.

… Alright, I guess; I mean, I like to think that’s true, but I just have no motivation. Right now, anyway. I’ll get to that later, though. 

Anyway.

I’ve drained the account already. It was supposed to put me through at least a year of school; Mom always made a lot of money

Bullshit. Again. That’s me, I really didn’t take your advice to heart.

I know exactly what I spent it on.

At first it was just alcohol. I mean, it was just a way for me to forget. Then I moved on to painkillers. Those killed the account pretty fast, along with paying rent for the shitty apartment I’d found. The pills turned me into a zombie, so I just switched back to booze. That way, I could at least think while I was marinating in my self-pity. Or at least be conscious, if not really thinking. I’d sit in the apartment and drink until I couldn’t think anymore. Drown my sorrows in shitty whiskey, I guess.

My sorrows? Yeah, you need me to be detailed and clear if I want you to help me. Got it.

Alright

It was my fault. I never should’ve let him go out that night to get milk from the store. I should’ve gotten it

Again

It was cancer. Colon cancer. That’s what killed him. His own body saying “fuck you

He didn’t even get to see me cross the fucking stage.

…Alright

I didn’t visit him in the hospital.

And that’s not bullshit. That’s just me being a shitty son.

I was “too busy” hanging out with friends, pushing it away. Trying to forget that my dad wouldn’t make it.

I never fucking visited him. Not one. Single. Time. Not even when my mom begged me to.

I’m a fucking horrible person.

The last time I saw him was in his coffin at the funeral. I didn’t even give a fucking eulogy. How sad is it that your only child won’t even speak at your own funeral? Because he’s too pathetic?

Anyway

I took it home without reading it

At least

It’s been stuck there since he died

Two weeks ago

I guess I wanted her to cry, but instead, she just sighed like she expected it, like she knew it was coming. She told me I could move in with her if I wanted, but I told her I’d just take my stuff to my apartment and go. She just said ""whatever.""

Man, in her heart, that I’d never be anything more than a leech. That’s what I am. A parasite.

I found the note when I was moving my desk. I didn’t know what it was. I figured it was probably some shitty poetry

I brought the letter with me today. Here

&gt;Son

&gt; I know that the last few months have been terribly difficult for you, never get to see the smiles on the faces of his grandkids.

&gt; I know why you didn’t visit me. And it’s okay. It’s okay that you didn’t visit me.

&gt; I know this is the part where I’m supposed to tell you how disappointed I am in you. How I can’t believe you let your grief rule you

&gt; But I’m not disappointed in you. I understand. Really

&gt; I bet you still remember what we had for dinner that night. Steak, the ones you always asked for us to buy because you liked them. I don’t think you’ll ever forget any details from that conversation.

&gt; Telling you I was going to die was the second hardest thing I’ve ever done. The hardest thing I’ve ever done is living with your face afterwards. You had an expression of sadness that runs through to the soul

&gt; You let your grief consume you.

&gt; In my last moments

&gt; And that’s okay. I probably would have done the same thing. It’s so much harder to deal with the death of a parent when you know that it’s coming. I speak from experience.

&gt; I won’t kid you

&gt; Don’t lie. Lies poison you. They make it so you live your whole life suspicious that you might say the wrong thing and someone will catch you.

&gt; Don’t give up either. Don’t be one of those people who recedes into themselves because they can’t handle their grief. I had to die eventually. It’s the one thing that’s constant for everyone. *Memento mori

&gt; Here’s what I want you to do: be sad for me. Cry at my funeral;  wish I’m there when you know I can’t be; be reminded of me by little things like when my favorite movie comes on TV

&gt; And then

&gt; I hope you read this

&gt; Be nice to you mother. Tell her I love her.

&gt; And know that I love you. I’ll miss you as much as you’ll miss me.

&gt; Oh, make sure you watch the baseball game every so often. I may not see it, but this will finally be the year that we win the World Series.

&gt; Love
&gt; Dad

So, I sucked at following dad’s advice. I didn’t do anything that he asked for in his letter. I lied. I gave up after he died. I never moved on.

I accepted defeat. Because I’d defeated myself. I accepted defeat

It’s time I started listening to him

What? Okay

Fine. It’s time I followed my dad’s advice and moved on. That’s why I moved out. That’s why I’m saving all my money to pay back my mom. That’s why I stopped drinking. I’ve been clean since I found the letter.

And that’s why I came in to you. Because I need help. I need to take the broken pieces of my life and put them back together. And I think therapy’s the best place start.

I may be broken, there’s nothing that can’t be fixed.

I have to move on. I have to stop surving

No

Because if I know anything in this fucked-up world we live in

Thanks for the meeting. I appreciate it. I learned a lot about myself.

I’m going to go visit Dad in the graveyard. It’s about time I did that.

And then I’m going to finally move on. I’m only going to think about happy memories of Dad

Because that’s what Dad would want. It’s what he deserves from his son.

And that’s something that I know for sure.

""When you're ready, follow me, and I'll start the tape.""  I nod and follow him back to his office.

I get comfortable in one of the large-backed leather chairs sitting in front of the attorney's desk.  In front of me sits one of those old reel tape players.  The attorney walks over, the familiar sound of my now-dead sister's voice fills the room.

""David, take away all your thunder.  I spread rumors behind your back, I told our parents complete lies just to get you in trouble.  They always believed me, took my word in every argument, doted me when they ignored you.  I am truly sorry for all the harm I did to you.

""I also regret never being there for you.  When you were bullied in school, I knew, and I never did anything to convince them.  When you were in terrible relationships, instead of showing you what was wrong, I belittled you and your girlfriend.  When you were struggling through college, I never helped you, I instead insulted you for failing classes.  When you couldn't find a job, lazy lowlife instead of trusting in you and encouraging you.  When you got married, and skipped your wedding

""And you know what?  The saddest part about this is that *I did it out of love for you.*  I'm so, you had the true friends, you found true love.  I tried to make up with a sharp tongue, a successful but shallow business, lots of fairweather friends, and lots of meaningless, self-centered relationships.  I tried to be you, your friends

""I know it isn't much of an apology, I'm leaving you everything.  The magazine, the New York penthouse, the sports cars, the bank account, everything.  It's all yours.  Do as you please with it.  Just please, please forgive me for everything I did to you and everything I should have but didn't.  *Know that I love you, and I always have. I've just been terrible at showing it.*""

I get up, stick it in my pocket, and walk out.  My mother and sisters are still puffy-faced and teary-eyed.  I barely acknowledge them as I walk out the door.

I tread across the somber knoll with a lilac in my hand.  They were her favorite flower.  My knees press deep into the freshly packed dirt of her grave as I place the flower in the little vase on her gravestone.  A single tear rolls down my cheek

I told Nina how I’d hate to be eulogized on Facebook like they did for that girl who died in that car crash.  I made my four-year-old cousin memorize the passcode to my phone so he could share photos

I think I’m expecting someone to piece together all these bread crumbs like a detective set on cracking the case of my life, it still comforts me to know that I’m leaving clues behind.  These clues would solve the mystery of me if anyone cared to take it on.  But deep down I know, I know.  No one in this world had ever, will ever want to solve my mystery.  No one except me.  And I go to my dying day having never solved it.  

I’m not talking about the mystery of my death.  I won’t be a homicide case, medical jargon.  He’s going to embellish the story of my life with, “She was beautiful, she was kind, she was loving…”  And then he’s going to cap it all off with, “But most importantly, she was saved.”

She was my daughter, friend.  I’ll tell you that story

How self-centered I am to think that within me is a whole universe to be revealed.  I am conceited to think that I could be important enough to have books and documentaries made about my life.  I am not so special.  Just look at my profile on Facebook.  Look at my likes.  Never averaging above five on a post.  Look at my social life, but at this center I hold a lowly position.  At this lowly position I maintain an inner longing, holding my masked appearance of well-being, hoping that someday someone will look beyond the status likes and social outings to solve my mystery and discover the real me.

1372919296.0,1hmc3c,[PI] Thin Blood - July Contest,SomeoneStopThisMan,11,0,0,"Brandon pressed his lips against the steel flask and cocked his head back to have the gin flow down his throat. He was getting low again, and he was going to have to scrap up some cash for some more winter clothes

A few past memories seeped into his head, but at the cost of his own morality. He was an ex mercenary, a contract killer for hire. He slayed women, children, even a princess. After a while, he couldn’t do it anymore, he knew it was wrong and laid down the gun. 

“Change?” he said to a passerby who only continued walking without showing any sign of acknowledgement. Another man passed by as he raised his cup up again. This wasn’t a way to live, his tie was made perfectly, his suit was well tailored. This guy had money, so as he started to run by Brandon, he swiftly stuck his leg out and tripped the man whose briefcase spilled into the ground revealing pills of all kinds.

“You little peasant, no, it’s all ruined!” The man grew angry and stuck his hand into the throat of Brandon and slammed him against the wall “Don’t you homeless people have any manners?”

“I’m sorry sir, and he knew he could reverse it when the time came.

“These pills all together are worth ten thousand dollars,” said the man whose veins were starting to bulge out of his head as he yelled. The onlookers just continued walking past as though it was another day in the city. Brandon couldn’t take the rudeness anymore and as he was about to flip the man on his back, and recognized his eyes.

“Sal?” said Brandon. The man stopped his barrage of insults and looked at him

“Brandon? Damn, they used to be close friends, and he even helped him once on some trouble from a rival drug dealer. Their relation was blood though, Sal was his brother, though he refused to even associate with his kind anymore “Look, you want the truth?” Sal looked around as though he was making sure no one was overhearing the conversation then leaned into his ear.

“I’m ten thousand dollars in debt right now to Vincent, and I’ll be sleeping with the fishes faster than you can say ‘That’s the game you play’,” said Sal as he pulled away “, I need your help. You need to do a job for me.”

“What’s the job?” asked Brandon. Sal rustled through his briefcase, a woman, and two children both a boy and a girl.

“This guy lives in a house on 31st street, but he hasn’t given me a damn dime in a year and I know that cocky little prick is in cahoots with Vincent,” said Sal “I want you to head over there, and ask him so kindly for the money. If he doesn’t, send him a message to make sure he learns his mistake, and see what you can scrape up with the valuables in his house that equals $10,000 so I can get Vincent off my ass.”

“Do I look like I’m still in the mercenary business?” asked Brandon.

“Look,” a tear rolled down his eyes. Brandon knew he was telling the truth, but he didn’t think he’d have to reenter the game this way. You know what they say though, if you’re good at what you do, you’ll always come back to it.

“I don’t have anything anymore though,” said Brandon as he lifted up his hands and grabbed his clothes to stretch out and reveal the holes.

“Don’t worry, and for god sake ask for a shower because you stink more than Daisy on a friday night.” Brandon couldn’t help but laugh, Daisy was a known whore on the streets, but she was also Sal’s wife. Don’t know why, maybe he just likes girls that are easy.

“Alright Sal,” said Brandon.

“Brandon! You’re living in a cardboard box, and you won’t ever have to worry about when your next food is, or how you’re going to wipe your ass.” It was a tempting offer, to finally get out of being homeless and into what he was always good at.

“You got yourself a deal

“What part of you smell terrible don’t you understand?” said Sal smacking his hand away “But it’s good to have you back

Brandon started to walk toward Elm Street, but some called him The Arsenal. They even said that the police department get their weapons through him. If you look at the crime rates, you would believe it to be true. The address lead him to a construction site, with a small trailer in the back. As he walked toward the trailer he was stopped by one of the construction workers.

“Are you lost

“I was sent here by Sal

“Checks through

With a swift kick to one of the men that ran up

“Stop! You’re going to kill them Brandon

“Just give me what I need and I’ll be on my way

“Ah Brandon

“If I could only be so lucky

“I understand

“This is all I’ll need

“Are you sure? Did Sal even tell you what you’re up against?” asked Frank as it caused Brandon to pause and look back. The expression of confusion on his face answered it all “You’re going against the big five, John, Rascatti, and even Vincent himself will be there.”

“Are you kidding me? That’s suicide!” said Brandon as he rushed back into Frank’s face “You’re expecting me to go up against almost the whole goddamn city as every kingpin will be loaded with body guards.”

“Desperate times calls for desperate measures

“Over $10

“Yeah, and grabbed a few grenades.

“This is the last favor I’m doing him for sure, he was going to have to enter his old world again, no mercy.

He was dropped off at the corner and the house that he was targeting was in the middle. It was the largest house on the street, and it had an off smell to it, something he remembered but couldn’t quite put a name on it.

Then he turned the corner and saw a body in the chair

“No

“Fine fine, as he took his pistol out. Then he noticed he forgot to add the silencer, worthless. He pulled out his sword slowly, and tilted a bit out. As they started to untie the man, Brandon rushed forward and sliced the head off one man. Before the other man could react, Brandon took the sheath of the sword and slammed it into the throat of the man to catch him off guard. With a quick movement he sliced the sword through the heart and pulled out slowly as the man dropped to the floor. 

With no time to waste he continued up the steps which lead to the kitchen area. He could see a few cooks running around

“Hey do you guys make an cheese burgers or something?” asked the guy, to get back in. Time is ticking, he had to make a move, and Brandon pulled out the pistol and fired a bullet straight into the skull of Angelo. The cooks screamed and dropped to the ground as the body fell as well. He pulled a grenade off his waist and tossed it into the next room without hesitation as he slammed the door open. He saw them, the crew of now four with a few of their men standing up on guard. The grenade tossed into the room and with three seconds you heard a rush of bodies, and then an explosion. The door blew off the hinges, glass shattered

Brandon walked back into the room and looked around

“You come into my house, behind the table and could see the bullets fly above. He was lucky that most of the top men no longer knew how to kill. He heard the click of the gun as the last bullet escaped. Brandon hopped over the table with his pistol drawn as Leo dropped the gun and held his hands in the air. 

“Sal had a message for you, Rascatti and Vincent. The next door entered a hallway in which lead to several doors down the path but with each kick to the door there wasn’t anyone in the rooms. It then lead to the lobby, a large area where you could see Rascatti scrambling toward the door. 

Brandon fired a few shots, but he was too slow, all those carbs of spaghetti and pasta was his demise as Brandon rushed up behind him and sliced him in the back, and through the head. He didn’t care though, he kicked the body away to reveal his keys, grabbed it and started the car to get to Vincent. He caught up, as they started ramming into each other with their cars

They reached the bridge, and then jumped into his. With the sunroof in perfect position, he smashed his hand through the roof and dropped a grenade. With a roll off the side of the bridge and into the icy waters he saw the car blow up, and the bridge along with it. The swim to the shore and the walk in order to go back to Leo’s house took an hour or two. He did promise to get the money, but when he arrived it was already surrounded by Sal’s men. Sal exited the house as Brandon got up and he showed him the briefcase of money.

“You did a great service

“Yeah

“It feels great, the loyal members know you’re a traitor and will hunt you down,” said Sal as Brandon quirked his eyebrow. He knew information traveled fast, but not this fast “I tipped them.” Brandon grew furious, but he wasn’t surprised. Sal only thought of himself, that’s why he hated calling him brother. 

“So what now? I have to escape into the unknown again?” asked Brandon.

“You did say you wanted a way out,” said Sal as he pressed the barrel of his gun into the mouth of Brandon “And here’s my ticket to being painted in infamy when they find out I took revenge on the traitor who killed the big five.” He pulled the trigger, and it was lights out.",Prompt Inspired,False,,t5_2s3nb,,http://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/1hmc3c/pi_thin_blood_july_contest/

i'll try to not screw it up this time. comments welcome.

What Makes A Good Man

Under the sallow flickering glow of a fading light bulb, he had opted for simple chinos a tight fitting black shirt, so closely fitted to the sculpted contours of his compact frame it gave the impression of a second skin. His spare sensibilities extended beyond wardrobe to the rest of him—he was athletically lean, hair still neatly trimmed in a high and tight, taciturn in speech, and nearly expressionless to boot, his only affectation the hard look of the demobilized—which gave the impression of a man of simplicity and direct manner that engendered trust. Aside from intriguingly garnet colored eyes

He docks his handset and runs a diagnostic. The elbow servo was burning out. Motion range restricted to one hundred sixty degrees. Exposed wiring in the wrist by the battery house also promised to wear out soon

Putting away his handset, so long as they didn’t try and sneak into center city or get to the upper floors. Clocking in at about twenty pounds despite the light weight alloys and parts, he thought he detected an ever so subtle asymmetry between right and left sides. Shit. Lose an arm and gain neuroses about your body being out of balance. Of all the fucking problems to have—

Deep breath. He draws himself up like a soldier. Chin out, I just play one on the vids*. Exhale. *Whatever, time to make some monopoly*.

Stocktamento sulks in the late summer night. Low City is slung in the mid-nineties, burned out cars, and the lurkers walking the streets. Yeah, the Deeps ‘n’ Creeps are out in force tonight and why not? It’s Friday. Everyone’s got a hustle or a fix and something they need in return. “Fat kissa,” someone hisses in the slum cant and though Alcides still doesn’t get most of it, he knows enough to know that he doesn’t need paper to pay for one the man is offering. He smirks. *I’m on the same side of the dodge, buddy

Alcides heads to the comrail station in south Lodi. He’s gonna take the Golden Rail to some club north of Yuba, filmed in panaroma from eight angles, to the ID pad where he’s got to drop his citizen card in, lean into the eye reader, and slide his right hand against the panel so the near field can register his prosthetic. *Mayorga Mendoza, Alcides. AMM94SF04478. Resident Community Park 84, 2126 Century Boulevard, vitamin d deficiency. Warning

And just like that he’s allowed into the true undercity. Black and red police commandos greet him on the other side with machine gun wariness. Their Dutch language trained canine partner emits guttural disapproval while his robotic counterparts glare at him flat faced with three red eyes from the other side of uncanny valley. *Some respect they got for vets*

On the platform it’s just him and this cute young thing wrapped up in a miniskirt and latex bodysuit with cut outs just close to all the right places. Alcides stared. No way she was a creeper. Make-up was on in all the right places without the clownlike proportions and there weren’t and bruises or tracks that he could see. She could be an undercover pop-it looking to slum her fix rather than pay her Middle Thirty premiums, smacking of the middle class and a good education. *Doing the Lord’s work here, honey? Taking some pity on the Low City scum before you hit the sky lounges?*

The train comes and there’s only one car open to the two of them. His lucky day. She sits with her legs crossed, they’re not for you, Al ole pal. They’re for the lawyers, doctors, system architects, urban engineers, and maybe the right kind of officer if he’s got demob orders or they were high school sweethearts or something. Can’t buy a girl like that with money or bravado or with a fucking metal arm and over amped right side.

Silence is their only commerce on the lonely ride north. She’s looking away the whole time as the ads flash in from the track walls or the LED panels in the train turn over. He’s under no such obligation to pretend she’s not there. She gets off just north of the river in Arden-Arcade. A black and red and his three eyed robopal make sure that Alcides doesn’t surreptitiously disembark. *Hasta eternidad, *look for me in your dreams, cuz you’re gonna be in mine.*

Another twenty minutes and he’s at the end of the line in Yuba. Six thousand credits later and he can confirm the Tierra Buena stop is anything but, Middle, or High Cities. Just flat and barren. Pill boxes and watch towers are set across the northern horizon amidst the chain links, razor wire, and mined countermeasures just beneath the surface. He can’t help but sigh. Even on a Friday, someone’s gotta be worried about the damn bugs. And if they aren’t worried about them, they gotta watch out for the creepers. A few decades in and you gotta wonder why they even bother with the twenty second century. 

His pause here is more wistful than Alcides would prefer. Free Land Armor Exoskeletons sit majestically in artillery repose under the pale moonlight. Half tank and half walker, looking for any movement on the other side of the fence. 

Not that it matters to him. They bounced him out of the MV Corps with a 4-F on a psych eval that meant there was no way they were going to plug him into a transformable tank and no circumstance where they’d pay him to shoot a weapon again. Paramilitaries wouldn’t touch him and he was deemed unlikely to transfer into civil professions. That left harvy or scavy, shit. It was the dole for Alcides. Fuck the army. He gave them his arm and six years of his life. They gave him a dark hole to disappear into, complete with protein paste, vitamin chips, and a whole lot of encouragement not to crawl back out.


*


Club Patroklos was not a place deserving of a fancy and hard to pronounce name, in and out on weekends and week nights, making himself a familiar face without quite being a regular. Sergey at the door knew him enough to let him in without the customary intimidation. It was not his kind of place but it was the kind of place where he could find someone else who felt out of place. And that mattered.

Lights in Patroklos need to be dim. Everybody’s waif thin with bags so heavy under their eyes you’d think they could carry a second pair of peepers to replace bleary red-rimmed set above. Sweat soaked bodies, it was hard to tell if they were actually enjoying themselves or biding their time in continuous chemical ecstasy until bug or fatal exhaustion took them. The dance floor is thin tonight, each strobe revealing so few revelers that their twisted and gyrating limbs evoke a burnt out forest. Aside from some East Asian eye candy trafficked in by the ownership, there’s not much to look at.

Alcides heads to the bar to wait and drink. His little paper and familiar face will carry him for a few hours. One finger signals a ‘cocktail, he thinks as the heavy bass drop catches him in the chest. He admires this. *They bend but they do not break*. He wants that to be a metaphor for his life.

Cocktails come and go and his gag reflex is pretty worn out by the time he sees him. Tall, close cropped hair, and eight tattooed mandibled heads on his neck fill in the rest of the details. A fellow vet with an impressive kill record. Alcides would know. He was proud of the four on his neck but they in no way measured up to eight notches. He only knew one guy who had a record anything close to that.

“Hey there

“Specialist Mayorga… Al?”

“Sergeant Lee?” he recognizes with a shit eating grin. Of course it would be that one guy.

“Lieutenant Lee

“Only one sixty degree movement. Haven’t made it round the VA lately.”

“Well

“They didn’t have a skin tone that matched me

“Ah, when that damned worker caught Specialist Mayorga from behind and clipped his right arm in the middle of the bicep. Sergeant Lee, an uptight by the book asshole of an NCO, seeing one of his subordinates in mortal peril charges from cover and kills the tick with two shots to the eye. He then pulled Specialist Mayorga back to cover where he was tended to by the company medic until he could be extracted by VTOL. At a field hospital in Dalton they removed the remainder of his arm so he could be fitted for a full arm prosthesis. Four months of physical and integrative therapy—not to mention a failed psych exam—later, Specialist Al Mayorga ended and the broken Alcides Mayorga, Resident Community Shithole eightywhatever, was left with the pieces of his life.

“How have you been?” Lee continued

“Getting by, “How about you? Last time I saw you, you were all meat and there were only seven of those… You join MV?”

That question was especially painful.

“Nah, “I’m infantry for life. After Atlanta I got into an experimental power armor unit. They tried to scale down some of the MV tech for human-armor integration and ditch the transformation aspects.”

“How’d that go?”

Lee takes a gulp of infused grain liquor and pruno and then a second

“Recon drop north of Liberal. Looking to scout enemy positions and expand the EZC north to Garden City, aka the land around the last cities we hadn’t lost. None of them came with positive reports, “We were at a power station in some burned out burb called Ulysses when we came across several soldier types.

“It was a quick firefight. I mean, their mandibles cut right through the armor. Snapped mine at the elbow like it was a twig. One of the legs pierced me a little below the pelvis,” he pointed at his right leg, perilously close to the groin, “I lost my rifle but was able to shoot an explosive charge from the arm cannon into its thorax. Blew the bastard in half.”

“Damn

“They gave me up for lost. My comm booster was damaged when the tick pinned me to the ground. Those suits

“They left you?”

Lee nodded, the… stumps. Starting sticking me with fluids and transfusions to keep me alive… but, you know, those suits are like anything else. Got a mean battery pack but it doesn’t last forever. Especially not when they’re in full emergency mode. When I saw the HUD flicker and die, I thought I was a goner.”

*Shit*, lowlife, that he had wanted to die. In the four months he adjusted to the arm and trained to qualify for the MV entrance exam, he had been focused, determined, eager to get back into the fight. It wasn’t till demob that he realized that only a part of him had come back. The not very good part.

“How’d they find you?”

“Meat detail came back to pick up the pieces. They got there just after I passed out, “Demobed after that. Got a PTSD diagnosis and that was that.”

Alcides could relate

Lee was glassy eyed and silent for a while. He took his drink pretty hard and had to force it down with a fist to his mouth.

“I thought about, you know, felt? We killed a bunch. Did they, regret? Miss… things? I don’t know, I was delirious. Mostly I thought about overriding the medical protocols and taking all the morphine in one shot. Going to sleep and never coming back.”

“Why didn’t you?”

“I wanted an eighth tattoo on my neck. I wanted them,” he slapped the bar with a solid sound of metal on scrap metal. The bartender looked over and Alcides gave him a nod and a hand across the neck. Their night had ended.

“Let me get it

“No, “I owe you.”


*


Outside the predawn was arid with the evaporation of old dreams. With Lieutenant Lee draped over his shoulder

With his right hand

“I was only a brevet lieutenant. I wasn’t ready.”

“C’mon buddy, Sergey, do you mind popping in and grabbing us a little something to smoke while we wait?”

The party has ended. For those inside, eradicating the waking moments and filling them, instead, with spiritual euphoria and a oneness that obliterates circumstance with its totality. 

Without the expectation of more guests for the morning, discharging six thousand kilovolts into his comrade. The shudder is rapid and one-shot-effective. Brevet Lieutenant David Lee’s weight doubles with unconsciousness. A van prowls from around the corner, pulls up quickly with the side door open, and takes its two occupants well from the sight of Club Patroklos’ doors by the time Sergey Hadjiev returns with a joint in hand.


*


“It was good hardware, top notch stuff. The baseport itself will be worth a fortune.”

“I’m glad

“Real good condition too. You could tell it was well taken care of. The donor too. Quite a catch.”

He lets the double entendre break on the shores of his indifference

“Probably will fetch a lot on the market.”

“That’s good.”

“I suppose you expect to be paid well for it, but Jayne likes to say it.

“It only seems fair.”

“It only seems fair, but Jayne probably supposed that too.

“I can fix that

“How much?”

“Ninety thousand plus parts.”

“Ninety!—What the fuck, if nothing else, still has a vibrant home in the heart of Alcides Mayorga.

“I don’t have that kind of paper monopoly. No one does unless they’re a big time spice dealer. You know that.”

“I know that you owe me

“Okay, Al. Let me throw in the fix for free. I got a spare servo and can do the rewiring. That is one fifty easy. The rest I can give you in merchandise.”

“Merchandise? What am I supposed to do

“Fair price? C’mon, let me throw in two ounces of mélange. Four grams in pills, the rest powdered. You can push it at the clubs and get another three, four hundred easy.”

It made economic sense. It was dangerous as hell, there were a few clubs. Some spice, a rep as a good dealer, no bullshit, a fellow member of the disadvantaged “enhanced” with a friendly ear… could work. He also had to admit the unspoken message here. Jayne was granting him a kind of protection and in return demanded a certain kind of flexibility.

“Fine

“And a battery charge too

“You know… we didn’t have the sedatives ready when he came to. He called out for you. Called you by name. Said you were buddies.”

“Did he?”

“Yeah. Said you were friends.”

Alcides thought about this for a moment.

“I said everything to him that I needed to. What time should I come back?”

“Tonight

“Tomorrow

“Sunday

As he walks out the door

The belief that there will always be hands to ground you again.

It came on a sunny Saturday. Weather never cooperates. It rains on weddings, is cold on the first day of spring. Death comes smiling on a holiday, revels with innocent gaiety, takes his due, harvests the kingly grains of last season to leave room for the next year's seedlings. Dresses sharply. Whistles popular tunes. Nods and blows kisses and keeps that promise to call you again sometime later.  It's June and the weather is pleasant and it gives you a little reminder of the what comes after.

Somber and staid were the tones of the packaging. Completely incongruous with an all you can drink mimosa afternoon. It stood on her kitchen table for a good week and a half, willful if not autonomous, domineering. An echo from the world after, though it was really a thing from the before.

AfterWord is ornate in its simplicity. Smooth slate casing, casual: initials to initials, a date of recording. It's just a thumb drive too. Digital preservation of our analog lives. Flash memory modern and immortal, replicable nearly infinite times across infinite devices, starkly superior to three days of formaldehyde vanity before family roses seal the casket., near permanence, defiant contrast to the messy entropy that grinds memory into dust.

When the storm's recrimination subsided and the power came back it was sunny and clear eyed on a Thursday afternoon. She stuck it in the computer quickly

By the light of day he looked thin. His room at hospice was small but brightly lit, the only fixture was a golf magazine. Something he'd picked up on the way, no doubt, but never opened. Like so many things he'd promised before, it was there as a reminder of what he always intended to do but never found time for.

“Hi, coughed, and paused while he cleared his throat for several seconds. “It sounds worse than it is,” he assured, “They keep me good and doped up. Food's ok. I--” he broke, choked again, and it was as if he was going to cut the session off right there, but he caught himself

“You know kiddo, things, they, uh, get in the way of... other things, and you tell yourself that next time will be different. That you're gonna be different, that things... ah, I would have

And she doesn't. Memory is pastiche. At a certain age, justification. It is not for record. Record is anathema to memory. Record is embarrassing photos, plays that aren't attended, birthdays forgotten. Memory, on the other hand, is the honey like recollection which can preserve a day forever but never does service to a lifetime. 

He stood large in her life when she was known only as 'knee-high' and 'tyke.' How many imaginary schoolyard battles had he won for her in proxy? So many that she started to fight his for him, threw her out of the house and then cried herself silly at her graduation. How bitter the rejoinders then, how she lorded his absence over her adolescent tenant, Cinderella defaming the Prince in a losing battle for the ugly stepdaughter.

Memory is a battle for definition. Politicians and generals wage war over who will be forgotten in the history texts while common folk fight ever more bitterly for the attention of those who will listen, the abortive sallies forward, the circuitous path of his campaign, without ever acknowledging his fear of the Red Sea. 

There were many words but not the ones that mattered

“Remember, a new habit without enough time to begin, a game of golf without handicap, lost before the first tee.

He looked into the camera gaunt faced, the great shadows cast where the tee shirt draped off his bones was bleeding over on to the linoleum. His clothes were giant still, but in her eyes now she saw something smaller beneath.

She turned off the video then, and that would always be part of her story.",Prompt Inspired,False,,t5_2s3nb,False,,

**The Last Time We Remember.**

It took a lot to get Jamie Escar going; took a lot to pull her out of the customary nonchalance she’d perfected over a decade in the industry, Delaney Fox’s presence. 

And yet at that very moment, pointy-end first, into Del’s exposed and very vulnerable neck.

‘I know what you’re thinking

Jamie dug her nails into the surface of the table standing between them. 

‘I really think you don’t.’

Del ignored the warning tone. 

‘It’s been three months and she hasn’t given up.’

‘Good for her

Del sighed and scanned the room, and how, now that she had more money than she knew what to do with, she should get a decorator with better sense of light and space. 

To be completely and utterly honest

‘It’ll take less than ten minutes, raising his eyebrows, ‘what do you have to lose?’

‘You once told me a minute of my time was worth a hundred dollars.’

‘That was rhetorical—’

‘And she wants ten minutes. Does she have a thousand dollars?’

‘Jamie—’

*‘Does she have a thousand dollars?’* 

Jamie’s voice cracked at the self-imposed decibel limit. She wouldn’t let herself get any louder. She wouldn’t. 

Del chewed over her question

‘Well then.’ 

But Del still had some ammunition left. ‘Family shouldn’t have to pay to see you.’

‘She isn’t my family.’

‘Tasha considered—’

‘I don’t care what Tasha considered!’ Jamie leaped to her feet, unusually aware of the blood thundering in her ears, ‘if you haven’t noticed, Tasha is dead!’

This ringing truth forced the room into silence. 

Jamie licked her lips, promised herself to treat him as a father figure, deserving of her respect and admiration more than anyone else in the world, and now the realization of failing a decade-old promise made Jamie’s heart ache with regret. 

She turned away and picked up the chair

‘I’m sorry.’

Del’s words floated over her shoulder. 

‘I shouldn’t have mentioned Ta—your cousin. You’re still grieving and—’

‘I’m not.’ 

Jamie faced him, their secrets forever lost to the tides of time. 

The lines on Del’s forehead stood out under the harsh white light, a still leaf desperate for a breath of fresh air to take it on its adventures. 

‘You loved her Jamie, but you did. She was your family.’

‘I loved her *because* she was my family.’ Jamie didn’t know how important the feelings were before she gave definition to them

Del stood up and Jamie fought the urge to collapse into his arms. Ten years he’d navigated her through the pitfalls and sinkholes of Hollywood

Some wounds, better successes. 

‘Ten minutes

And some wounds, and shaken free into the cold light of day.

MAURICE PETAKY

28 years old

Confession given on November 23

Begin Transcript

If I could just tell you I did it all and have you understand what all that meant, yellow memo pad.  Rolling the pages up, warping them-- instead of turning them like you’re reading something worth remembering.  It’s bullshit.  I wish I were writing in one of my notebooks. It would have completed me.  The moment when you finish a notebook is the most satisfying thing I have felt in all my 28 years. I am not afraid of writing this confession.  Writing in general has been possibly the only thing I was ever consistent with. I’m going to miss days at the library in the air conditioning just writing away.  Random thoughts.  Funny puns and word play. Even a business idea or two, but nothing serious. In fact,  As a transient, friends come and go more often than you’d like a lot of the time, so finding a way to be alone for me was my first priority, I guess this memo pad will be the last thing I ever write

Wendy Petaky was my only living relative as far as I know, I was doing work with a bunch of temp agencies.  You can verify that in Dallas, Texas as well as Waco, Texas if you like.  Anyways, she finally found me after one of the agencies put together some internet package thing that they said was going to help me find more jobs.  The guy gave me a good discount since I did a lot of good work for people and eventually Wendy must have found me and so she messaged me on there.  I feel like an idiot now waiting as long as I did to log in and read my messages.  I could have spent more time with her.  Wendy had had a stroke, so talking was extremely difficult.  Instead, we decided to keep writing each other.  Wendy Petaky was my biological mother.  I met her three times in real life

Wendy had explained to me she couldn’t afford her diabetes medicine.  I’m glad I didn’t inherit that, I call it in and when I show up to pick them up they wouldn’t give it to me because I didn’t have any ID.  I told them everything, the whole situation, but they wouldn’t listen.  They just kept apologizing and refusing which made me want to slap the shit out of them.  I just kept getting angrier and angrier as I got more and more helpless.  It was an awful feeling.  I leapt over the counter and knocked the 100-pound pharmacist out cold before crushing the slightly heavier one’s throat as I strangled her.  After the first few seconds, I realized it’s mostly thumbs.  I took the medicine and ran.  If I’d’ve been arrested before, you probably would have found fingerprints or something.  I guess it doesn’t really matter now.

Once I left I felt terrible about what I did.  I couldn’t tell Wendy, but I was too shocked from what I had just done.   Well that, and neither of us had a camera.

I robbed the bank for essentially the same reason, but once we get over the boarder we’d be safe.  I had always been told getting into Mexico was never an issue.  Getting back into the US was an entirely different story.  But at this point, it didn’t matter.  I was a fugitive and wasn’t trying to go back to a place where I was surely being hunted.

Of course, cramped apartment on Baker Street.  It looked peaceful enough.  Not like the pharmacist who I strangled.  I don’t know if I’ll ever stop seeing that look on her face when I close my eyes.  That look of complete terror as she was having the life choked out of her.  I guess it stuck with me because after living on the streets, people not only stop talking to you, they stop even looking at you.  That was the most eye contact I’d had had with a person in months.  Anyways, that’s when I called the police from her home phone and was taken in.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Soldier**
	He crested the hill and took in what lay at the top of it. The forest was thicker here, fallen logs were everywhere. Someone could easily trip.
	The soldier was about to continue on his way when he saw something off to his right. It was a speck of blue lying on the forest floor. Never one to miss a scouting opportunity
	The forest floor was muddy, a shade between green and brown, looked freshly cleaned. But in his careful steps over the logs it was not stiff; it moved with him. His helmet was plain and unassuming, the same colour as his clothes; his chest bore only one medal, gold with a red ribbon. He looked the essence of the word soldier, and he knew it.
	To his surprise, lying next to an old and rotting log, a little blonde-haired girl. She looked very pale, perhaps even close to death, and wore no shoes.
	The soldier slung his rifle, hoping against hope. To his surprise and relief, it was present and it was very strong. He bent down and put his hear to her face, confident he would hear breathing.
	“Hello
	He jumped back in shock and found himself reaching for his gun. He quashed his fighting reflexes and replied
	She sat up, and brushed bits of dirt from her turquoise sundress. “I feel…um…I think I’m okay. How are you?”
	He was pleasantly relieved to have some other intelligent being for conversation, and it was the truth. “Do you know how you came here, by any chance?”
	She bit her lip, I’m eight years old, and I live in Nanaimo, British Columbia, and…where am I now?” Only now did she become aware of her surroundings.
	“You are…” The soldier hesitated. Even he wasn’t sure of the true nature of the place he inhabited, Irene? I’ll tell you where you are later, when we’re somewhere safer. This isn’t really a good place.”
	“Okay, we were going into the parking lot of my church, and now…I’m here.”
	“I’ll take you to them
	“Am I in heaven?” Irene asked him after a pause.
	“Heaven? No
	She stood up

	They walked through the forest in silence for a short while
	“You live here?” she said
	“Yes
	“But it’s so small!” She was right. The hut consisted a fire pit for cooking, a few boxes, and very little else. The soldier ignored her comments, walked to the wall of the hut and opened one of the boxes.
	“Are you hungry
	“Hmm
	“Sorry, and a glass of water. Irene made a face.
	“Eww. What is that?”
	“Survival rations. Come on, but they have all the nutrition you need.” Irene folded her arms and looked at him.
	“Don’t you have anything else?” she whined.
	“No. I only keep the basics.”
	“You live on this stuff?”
	“I don’t need to eat.”
	Irene’s eyes opened wide. “How do you stay alive
	“I told you
	She looked mortified. “What are you!?”
	The soldier sighed. “I think I’ll get this over with. You’re actually in—”
	He was abruptly interrupted by a bear smashing through the left wall of the hut and letting out a mighty roar. Irene let out a high shriek that was just as mighty.
	“Irene, seemingly preparing to charge. The soldier fired a warning shot, causing the bear to growl and slam its paw into a box. The box flew across the hut and smashed to pieces on the side wall. The soldier fired another shot, but the bear still did not back down.
	A nagging thought came into the soldier’s mind: That bear looks oddly familiar. But if it is
	His suspicions were confirmed when a second bear smashed through the wall behind him, unsure of which bear from which she should protect herself. He grabbed her and held her fast at his side. “Stand your ground,” he whispered. “Be brave.” But even he found it hard to believe that he could defend them against two bears.
	The second bear seemed more inclined to attack than the first. In the soldier’s frantic switching between his sights of the two bears
	The shot hit the second bear and carried its right ear. It grunted, but it would not die. Out of the corner of his eye he saw the first bear begin to advance for the kill. When both bears were but a foot away he braced himself for the pain—but a strong force pushed him out of the way, to the door of the hut, and he was shocked at what he saw.
	Irene stood,” she said firmly.
	The soldier could scarcely believe what he saw next. Irene turned to the first bear
	The second bear, and Irene watched it carefully until it could no longer be seen in the thick of the forest.
	Then she collapsed to the ground.
	The soldier rushed to her
	“Yes
	“I did? But then why don’t I remember it?”
	“I don’t know
	“Can I make you disappear
	The soldier chuckled. “No. I need to get you to your parents
	Irene did not seem concerned about that ominous statement. Instead
	“Yeah
	“You know how you shot off that bear’s ear?”
	“Ah…yes
	“You know what you call a bear without an ear?”
	“What?”
	“B.”
	The soldier burst out laughing.
	“Can I have one of those weird cube thingies now?”

	Irene scarfed down four of the nutrition cubes before looking up. “So…what do you think those bears were
	“I know exactly what they were, and was about half finished one of them. “I’ve met them before.”
	“You have?”
	“I fought them off by causing a rockslide onto them. It’s amazing they survived. Nasty fellows
	Irene thought carefully. “Yeah…we studied parts of it in Sunday school...”
	“There’s a story where a group of “young fellows”—teenagers, fearing for his life, called down a curse on the young men.”
	“What’s a leper?” asked Irene.
	“Someone who has the disease leprosy.”
	“Oh.”
	“When he finished saying the curse
	“Wow. But how did they get out of the Bible and come here?” Irene asked with surprising insight for her age.
	The soldier sighed, hauled a stone of a fair size to the table, and sat down across from Irene.
	“What…do you mean?” Irene had stopped chewing a fourth cube to listen. She looked shocked and dismayed
	The soldier took a deep breath and revealed, they’ll be here, sort of.”
	“I forgot where I left my teddy.”
	“You’ll find that information here
	“But how can I be here? I’m not forgotten.”
	“Don’t ask me how it happened. Most of the time, and it’s never here for very long. But I can tell you are more than a memory—you hunger for food, for one. Your full essence, your soul, has come into Medulla.”
	“But
	“I know of no passage from here into the real world. You are quite possibly trapped here for all eternity.”
	Irene burst into tears. The soldier waited patiently for her to recover
	“However, and knowledgeable. They say he’s like a grandfather to all of us in this land. He just might be able to tell us a way for you to go home.”
	“Why didn’t you say so?” said Irene
	“That’s the problem. He tells no one where he resides. And they say that those who have found him never want to reveal the location; they get uncomfortable and change the subject. I do know of one being who has seen the Tree of Life
	Irene thought this over. “So
	“Yes.”
	“Then let’s go!” She jumped from the chair and tried to decide between the door and the unfixed hole in the wall.
	“Irene
	“What is it?” She turned toward him.
	“I’d just like you to think about something for a minute. What’s something people forget all the time?”
	“My mom always forgets where she left her keys
	“Kind of right
	Irene thought. “I guess I can kind of remember one of them.”
	“That’s my point. Everyone seems to have one bad dream they remember. But they forget all the others forever. And what happens to forgotten things?”
	“They go here?”
	“Exactly.” The soldier shuddered. “Those bears were an unlucky blip. People can usually remember them, no, these journeys, you will encounter nightmares all the time. In my experiences with them they not only fill you with fear on sight, they attack viciously and unpredictably, and are extremely difficult to kill.
	“We are safe in this forest. But if you want to get home
	Irene looked in a daze as she considered everything she had just heard. But she shook it off
	“Great. I think I have a backpack around here somewhere…” He found one in one of the boxes that lined the walls of the hut. “Here.” He opened another box and dumped all of its contents into the pack. “That should last us until we can get supplies. I have enough nutrition cubes and water in there to last you about a week.”
	“What’s your name?”
	The soldier was caught off guard. “I…I don’t have a name. I suppose nobody ever named me and I didn’t need one.”
	“But you have to have a name! Everybody has to have a name! What would I be if I weren’t Irene?”
	“I don’t know.”
	“Hmm…” Irene looked up thoughtfully. “Can I just keep calling you Mr. Soldier? I like that name. You are a soldier
	“Yes
	The soldier was alarmed at how attached he was becoming to this girl

	They set out through the forest at a brisk and hopeful pace at first. This soon descended to a moderate, as he was ageless? Civilians were to be treated with as much respect as fellow soldiers, he knew that. 
	But he had never had any fellow soldiers
	“Mr. Soldier?” said Irene. She sounded a bit bored. “How come you said there aren’t any nightmares in this forest?”
	“Because I know it. I actually know a ton of stuff that I have no way of finding out
	“I don’t know what I’d do if I lost all my memories.”
	“I think I know all of that just because I was one of his ideas.”
	Irene stopped. The soldier did not realize she had for a few seconds and walked some distance ahead of her. She was looking at him strangely. “You’re not real?”
	“Well
	She walked to him and grabbed one of his legs. Then she felt the cloth of his trousers between his fingers. “You seem pretty real. But you don’t really exist.”
	“Of course I exist! It’s just that…ah…” Irene resumed walking
	“If I don’t exist
	“I’m real. I guess I’m just somewhere all the stuff that doesn’t exist goes.”
	“What’s the difference between us
	“I came from the real world.”
	“This is my real world. Let’s just stop; my head’s starting to hurt and we could go on with this forever.”
	“But I’m not done yet!” Irene seemed eager to continue their philosophical duelling, ceased to exist. It was simply there one moment and not the next. Small amounts of dirt rained down from the sides of the newly created gorge, into what looked like a deep chasm.
	“Oh dear
	“What is it?”
	“This is either some odd kind of nightmare I’ve never seen before
	“What could be worse than a nightmare?” Irene interrupted.
	Most of the forest behind them
	“Recall! Run, when a large section in front of them disappeared. Unperturbed, they ran around it, diving to the ground as the last of the wood returned to memory.
	Irene looked up and looked back at the forest
	“Exactly
	Irene looked down into the chasm. The sides were about three metres high
	“Spoken like a true soldier
	“So that forest…it came out of here and into that guy’s mind?”
	“Yes.”
	“I guess that means it exists then?”
	“Correct.”
	“Do things like that happen a lot in this place?”
	“All the time.
	“Could that happen to me?”
	“I wish I knew the answer, this debate is closed.”
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Here's the story course as I intended it (spoiler alert?): the soldier and Irene eventually come to a small ramshackle town of memories

The soldier and Irene make their way to the Tree of Life (note: this is the tree in the Garden of Eden, she has godlike powers over forgotten things. The soldier is an almagation of an author's idea of a perfect, obedient, loyal, and skilled soldier. The Tree of Life gives Irene a door that leads either to consciousness or to the next world, but it cannot tell which. After goodbyes and her passage through the door, the Tree tells the soldier that only one person may know its location at a time, and that he is the new guardian of its location. The soldier salutes and walks off into the desert.",t5_2s3nb,True

“ah gwan love
“Eric love

“A half?” 

“Nope. You're bound to break something again

“I'll break your jukebox.” Eric smiled back, his thirsty throat wheezing from the unexpected movement. The barmaids eye's appear glazed over, almost soulless, she'd always had to shut herself off from the putrid perverts and groping hands. “Just go home...” She paused, life pouncing back into her deserting pupils. “Sorry Eric, I forgot.”

“Well love, a faded red of failed dreams. Janis ignores him, half-heartedly pushing an old rag across the bar, an emotional lass she truly did pity the pathetic mess before her. The other punters had stumbled home to there families, the jukebox long since played it's last song, just our Eric left with nowhere to go. “Look Eric, you can stay on one of the seats tonight, an uneven jungle of yellowed teeth shone across at the merciful barmaid. “Thanks Janis.”

.

There is a few minuets of silence as Eric began to reflect upon his pointless existence, his hand racing to dry up the past. Janis notices this and stands quietly watching, her eyebrows levitating as she holds her weary heart in despair. Attempting to shrug it off, she shakes her head violently, causing her long black hair to wave. Forcing herself to remember the time that Eric exposed his self proclaimed 'meaty salvation' to her elderly mother during her birthday party in the pub, how furious she was. Eric was barred for a month before worming his way back on to his trusted stool. Janis doesn't want to feel too sorry for the man, as pity is weakness and weakness is prayed upon by the desperate. 

However she did know of Kevan, her watering eyes beginning to melt.

“Aye, I'd come in drunk slagging his mother off and he just snapped.”

“That quick?” Janis questions

“No, he was right to... Just a shame he didn't account for the hunk of cheap gold on his finger. Then poof. Darkness.”

The barmaid bows her head
“You ain't herd the best part.” Eric shrugs. “That ring was the last thing his slut of a mother gave him. I always said that bitch wasn't happy with taking my life away so she took me eye as well.” Erics forced smile providing a thin veil to conceal his worry. Janis' pouted lips politely beam back.

.

The two talked for hours and much to Erics delight the drink kept flowing, trying to haul the conversation along. 

“Yeah, bail money they want, pfft. I swear to god I'd get it him it if I could.” Erics head leaped onto his welcoming palms. “Lord Jeysus above knows its my fault, the boys never been the same since me old eye fell out.”

“I'd help you Eric

“I know so, I'd die a happy man. We all know I'm close to checking out, I might not be here by the time...”

“Don't.” Janis begs, it plucks at the tired bones on her wiry frame. “I'm going to bed now Eric.”

.


Eric nods and waves goodnight, a hairy half moon with a cracked smile peeking out from Erics waistband. “For feck sake Eric! I might be a little soft, but I'm sure as hell ain't stupid... They're off.” She slams the door behind herself feeling betrayed, sulking off toward the friendly call of a real bed. “And pull your feckin' kecks up!”

.

By this point now Eric is blind drunk, a small square area with long claret sofas stretching wall to wall. However, his one good eye remains on the bandit machine in the corner. The solemn sound of a zipper brakes the silence. Checking over his shoulder Erics trembling hands reach down the front of his dampened jeans. The meaty salvation is due an appearance.  Erics twisted snigger echoes throughout the room. The blue, red and yellow lights of the fruit machine glistening, drawing him in like a careless moth to a light bulb. As Eric staggers towards the glow he trips over a fallen pool cue, allowing the dead weight of his body to collapse against the machines solid frame. Using all of his strength to hoist himself up, Eric faces the bandit. Drip, drip, coating his cheap market trainers in a golden jacket.

Eric is laughing hysterically at his latest drunken shenanigan

“Feckin' 'ell. Janis! Shi...”

Too late.

**   Part II – Like she's Mother Theresa.**


Erics eye opens upon a shore of immaculate white, gone gone.” He felt almost suffocated by the heavy burden of regret. “Poor Kevan, sure he's better off without ya. Is this all there is?” He could not see his body, though he was sure he was moving his arms, Eric continued to cry heavily. “Why the beyjeysus do I have a hangover in heaven, ya'd think they'd cut that sort of thing out.” However Eric was not in heaven, not even close

.

Unbeknown to Eric

“Get up ya eejit ya

Sure enough Eric felt the cold puddle of piss he'd slept in. “It's a miracle! Think this warrants a free pint?” He asked

“For Gods sake

Erics mouth drops in a false shock “But I'm the victim here. I'm the loyal patron who's fallen and slipped due to your cowboy machine leaking.”

“Fruit machines don't leak

“Miracle fruit machines do. What's that I feel? Hmm I'm no doctor but I think that's the old concussion.” 

“You bastard.” Janis screams

“*Have you had an accident or injury in the last five years that wasn't your fault?*... Well as a matter of fact I have.” Eric mocked. “Ay and when I get my claim in maybe I'll let you sleep on the pool room settee ya old tart ya.”


.

Janis and Ryan continued to watch Eric as he danced around the floor, almost praying for Janis' blessing.

“We can't do that

“Ay but he'll be long gone soon enough and we don't owe his tramp of a dad nothing. Plus if he ever finds out about Kevan and the old tax returns he'd shaft us for it everyday.” Ryan's beady eyes squinted as he spoke

“And if Kevan hadn't have fixed it? Who would be the tramps then Ryan?”

“Ok

.

An elderly woman wearily pushed the heavy pub door open, Janis' long suffering mother. An almost crippled pensioner who gave everything to her parish, that lovely old lady you'd help across the street, however dementia desperately dangled upon her every fearing thought. “Fr. O'Leary threw a grand old mass today” she chirped. “Well at least until he bit Mr. Parsons.”

.

Eric was a twisted man, he was about to get his biggest brake from the frail old woman. 
“Mass?” Eric cried out

The petite frame turned to face Eric

“It is so, I saw heaven itself.”

“Heaven? Here?” Poor old Mary-Jo, she innocently clung to her faith. “Ah what I wouldn't give to gaze upon the other side.” She sighed.

“I'm sure you wont have to wait too long for that one.” Eric muttered under his breath. “Get us a pint in and I'll show you the water.”

Sure enough Mary-Jo hobbled towards Eric, holding back his stale smile.
“And this is water of our lord and savior?” Mary-Jo appeared to grow as she smiled up at Eric.

“Sure

“Now you mention it I can smell the holy spirit dancing, poor Mary-Jo. “I'll have to inform the priest.”


.

With all the excitement of a child on Christmas morning, desperately trying to catch her self on the pool table as she swayed. Eric's mouth slowly began to gape as he watched the fragile, yet lovely, Mary-Jo plummet to the floor at warp speed.


.


“Mother!” Janis must have herd the noise and came bundling through the door frame, Mary-Jo appeared to almost leap up, reaching altitudes of around three feet. 

“Jeysus

“It was almost majestic.” Eric said in awe

“It's anudder miracle Mr. Lune.” Mary-Jo's voice appeared younger, It's fixed my bones.”

.

Whether it was wishful thinking or a perfect placebo placed within her deep desire, deciding whether to tell her dear old mother that she'd fallen in Erics piss. As she watched her mother dance around she couldn't bring herself to do it, the tooth fairy exists for today. “Yeah mother, a true miracle it is.”

“Fr. O'Leary needs to hear about this” Mary-Jo said
Eric greedily snatched at the small piece of paper, easily flung the heavy door to her side. There was a deep bellow of laughter as the few early morning drinkers began to heckle a Mary-Jo running past, a large wet patch of Erics urine had hitched a ride onto her plain purple skirt. 



.

A sharp bend was ironed into Janis' top lip


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Part III – The Holy Spirits.**


“Feck the lotta ya” Eric bellows as he stumbles off outside, the mothers scold their naive children, “Stay away from that tramp.” 

Fathers point him out to their dopey sons as an example. “See
In all seriousness this is life within its lowest form, a loner who holds a torch to the revolutionaries. A one-eyed, alcoholic, hobo with no true friends beyond the half empty glass beside him.


.


One of the few 'friends' Eric holds dear is the proprietor of a corner shop, or Imi as he likes to be called. This short, middle aged Pakistani man has picked the wrong neighborhood to set up shop, though you'd never notice due to his constant smile and cheery personality. Eric and Imi share a likeness in a sense, a bond formed by constant hate and upturned noses. It is all the rage for the bitter teens on dole, blaming their failure on the common enemy. The country's going to the dogs, while the idle cats lay in the sun. Eric stumbles into the corner shop


.



“Hello Mr. Eric.” Immi calls

“Just a bottle of the Russian shite

“Of course my friend” Imi replies. “Only very best for Mr. Eric. Premium brand back home.”

Eric stares at the foreign label

“No no no Mr. Eric.” Imi wails. “Five pound! It worth at least six.”

“You're having a laugh you.” Eric calls back.

 “I give you for six.”

“five fifty...”

“Six fifty.”

“Oh you don't even get it lad

Imi's eyes squint. “You break hold of my balls Mr. Eric. When you going to sort life out?” 

“Tell you what Imi, how 'bout that.” Eric laughed almost thoughtfully, staring into the distance.

“Ten bloody thousand!” Imi said

Eric smiles as Imi throws the cigarettes and vodka at him before scurrying off in the back


.


Eric's repulsive nature begs him to reach for a second bottle of vodka behind Imis back, Eric almost feels the calming swoop of humanity. It is wrong that Imi, a decent bloke who provides for his family, has to live like this. Under constant threat of hooligans, drunken slurs from the town 'hard men' and wave after wave of abuse crashing down upon his one sanctuary, his corner shop. Eric leaves abruptly, ready for his next adventure with alcohol

.

The swing-set creaks as it slowly rocks, his hand drawn back in an attempt to scare the children. It doesn't work as even the local kids see behind the vale, they know Eric is nothing more then a harmless old drunk. It was around noon and Eric had been on the park for at least an hour by now, his fickle dreams to save his son dwindling away with every passing second. In all fairness its not like he'd even tried, Eric knew the sum was far too large and was ready to accept it. The hollow of Erics eye threw itself on the ground, his patch swaying in the strong breeze, Kevan is done for. 

.

“Mr. Lune, let alone jogging. Eric couldn't believe his eye as he watched the secret ninja sprint towards him with pure speed. 
“Mr. Lune! Father O'Leary wants to see you right away.” Mary-Jo continued.

“Fuck for?” Eric replied.

“Language.” She snapped. “He wants to talk to you about the miracle water. The one you've found.”

“Feck sake Mary

“There may even be a little biteen for your trouble.” She smiled.

“It was just... our lord and saviour passing through with a blessing from above.” Eric lied

“Be careful with Fr. O'Leary now.” Mary-Jo warned. “He's not right in the old head department at the minuet. Sure he bit Mr. Parsons today at mass and last week I think he shat his kecks.”

“He bit Mr. Parsons?” Eric replied. “Like with his teeth?”

Mary-Jo nodded almost embarrassed. “What do you think of my shell suite?” she quickly asks trying to turn the conversation.

“Mary love

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


**Part IV – Of Ministers &amp; Men.**

As Eric approaches the parochial house he is almost stunned to hear what appears to be 'gangster rap', showing little to no remorse for the lie he is about to tell. 

“Father

“Ah Eric

“No. No father

“Of course

“It's all clouds. This is Nethertown.”

.

After luring Eric in with the promise of brandy, who bursts into insane laughter constantly whilst forever tearing at his dog collar. “So the water.” He began, “It is true? I saw Mary-Jo and she looked fantastic, such a lovely bottom on that girl.”

Eric began to cringe at the thought
“Is there any more of said water? You see Eric I have a problem of a personal nature and I believe the Lord himself has sent the water to fix it.”

“The Lord?” Eric laughs to himself.

“Either his grace or Moby.” The priest smiled

“Father


.

An elongated silence ensued for what appeared to be an eternity

“What cow?” Eric snapped

“It lives in the garden with a panther

“Reet

“No please

“What de ya even want it for?” Eric questioned

“It's the old testament Mr. Lune, so the priest wants to bash the Bishop?”


.

Eric would have left then and there, an ear. “It's Mr. Parsons.” The priest snarled. “Feckin' man is defiantly some kind of android, look how high-tech and realistic this ear is.” Standing in horror, Eric promptly promised to bring the miniature, holy Ian Huntley, a bottle of the miracle water.

.

It was early afternoon when Eric returned to the priests house, his hand grasping at the yellow bottle. “I can't come out now boy, I fear that the air may have been swapped with a poisonous substance.” He howled. “It may have already has infected you.”

“How do I get the moolah you promised then father?” Eric questioned

“Not to worry.” The priest said in excitement. “Here

Eric was thrown a small piece of plastic, a tinge of desperation clings to his trembling hands. *Enter pin... Check balance... Balance available – £12,943.* With this, Eric fainted.  


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**   Part V – Pope Eric I.**


How fickle the concept of popularity is, an estranged family members costly illness, everyone seemed obligated to inform Eric. 

“Well we've got the brewery coming next week.” Janis creped

“Sorry to hear that.” Eric almost mouths

“I swear they'll get you on anything.” Janis continued.

“I bet.” Eric said, whispering in his ear with a grave expression chiseled into the bones of her skull. They were not to see a penny of the money as Eric was sick of these people. Least not forget it was only this morning when he had been kicked out. Sure, he'd had an accident and caused minor damage, but every penny this tramp came across went straight into Janis' till.


.

“Fookin' 'ell Cockboy! She's a bit old for you innit?” A thuggish voice called from across the pub. Eric clocked upon a small gang of teenagers, Mary-Jo. Where had that little old lady gone? Eric noticed a hitch up her skirt and what appeared to be suspenders peeking out. By this point Mary was ravishing Cockboy, heavily throwing him against the unbroken triangle of balls. Her trembling hand threw a freshly opened bottle of whiskey across the table, it began bleeding out upon the green velvet. Much to the other teens mockery, Mary-Jo started to undo the buttons on her blouse. After hearing the young lads heckle at her, Mary-Jo led her twenty something year old lover into the toilets, away from prying eyes. Eric looked upon with with disgust as they barged past him

.


 In the corner Eric notices a friendly face

“Oright cocker!” Eric waved

“Oh. Mr. Eric

“I thought you people couldn't drink or eat pork or whatever it is you do.” 

“Mr. Eric, clutching his pint of bitter and pork scratchings. “Please Mr. Eric, take this and play bandit. It your lucky day today.” 

Imi handed Eric a small coin. Smiling to himself Eric agreed and quietly slipped away to play. 


.


Eric slumped towards his timeless nemesis, Eric listened to it clatter inside the machine and hungrily pressed the start button. The first wheel stopped.* Jackpot.* The second well hovered on a pair of cherries before gracefully falling. *Jackpot.* At this point time appeared to slow down, Eric could hear his drug fueled blood coursing through his veins... *Jackpot*. Three Jackpots. 

The bandit began to play a tune, but later realizes he's left his true love behind. Defiantly not a triumphant, victorious tune at all. Eric stood still enjoying the music, he used to sing this song to put Kevan to sleep as an infant.* “I stepped on board a vision and followed with a will...”* No coins fall out of the bandit however, just a loud clunking sound coming from the bowels of the glistening lights. Eric's convinced it must be broken, either that or this is some cruel payback for urinating on it that very morning. One piece of metal fell into the prize holder, but it was no coin. Eric falls to the floor when his fingers meet against the metals hard surface. He holds it close to his chest, it is Kevans ring. *“... And I awoke in California

Observing in silence, Muslims and Catholics alike, who swear by god but curse behind the shadows of his spine. Scheming landlords intent on collecting every small circle, leaving their bill an oblong as they cut every corner. Salt of the Earth. Eric ponders how many of the seven deadly sins have manifested themselves within the punters, which one he would be? Far too philosophical for tonight. He flicks the butt of his cigarette across the pool room, disgusted by the swamp around him. The small orange spark reluctantly rolls across the pool table as Eric slams the door behind himself. Inevitably falling towards the damp sea of whiskey Mary-Jo had dropped in her lustful rage, the fag end weaves through the lonely pool balls. It caught a blaze. The unsuspecting locals sung happily

Eric wearily pushed open the bathroom door

 “They don't make 'em like they used to.” She grunted.

#“I'm so sorry

“Ay, a tiny flame has set alight the desolate room beside them, the musty smell of burning wood carefully sneaking by the drunken noses.


.

As smoke infiltrates the busy bar room, leaving nothing but ashy saliva. The car park outside has erupted in panic, the jellied legs stiffening sober in the lonely skies.
“Is there anyone else still inside?” Janis called out. “The last thing I need is one of you old todgers dying in the place. The brewery doesn't care for that sort of thing.”

“No, no. No we're all here.” A trembling voice called back, the shock of the fire rattling through his vocal cords. 

“Aye

“Mother!” Janis snapped. “You sure that's everyone?”

.

Imi sat with his head in his hands on the cold concrete

.


“Mr... Mr. Eric on bandit.” He mumbled, arguing over their allegedly late arrival. Realizing he had gone unheard, Imi shot up, almost as if possessed.

“Mr Eric!” He bellowed as he began hobbling towards the blaze

“Feckin' hell. Eric!” The car park becoming more frantic with each passing second. The old timers all removing their hats as a sign of respect for the fallen troop.

 “It's too late. He'll be gone now.” A shared consensus. Janis cried heavily

 “Rest in peace



.


“Ye feckin...” A voice called from inside, a long arm spear-headed in front of his body, clenching a small glowing circle in his two fingers. “Christ almighty.” The man coughed, coming into focus Janis noticed the leather patch. It was Eric. Somehow during his frenzied rush, he had accidentally crafted himself a curtain robe and a lampshade helmet.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**   Part VI – In The Name Of The Father &amp; The Son. ** 

“Tanks da

“Pint?” Eric replied

“As long as it's not in the Fiddlers Elbow.” Kevan sighed. The people in there are off their fecking rocker.”

“Aye son, somewhere in the distance. “Some dosey cunt burnt it down.” He began walking, Kevan almost jogging to catch up.


.

“Did ya mean what ya said? Da... All them years ago?” Kevan bowed his head

“Course not son, he began to almost stumble in horror. Pointing in distress he began to stutter. “Da? Da your patch... A tear?”

Her name was Marta. She was the most beautiful girl I had ever laid eyes on in all my 16 long years, and saw a movie every weekend, and to me, this was it. This was love. Marta's father was not wild about her seeing a boy with my ""authority issues,"" but he never forbade her from seeing me. As an adult male with some experience under his belt, he was comforted by the fact that this young love was nothing more than a passing fancy. As a teenage boy, I was thinking with my penis
It started out like any other week. I was suspended from school for starting a bonfire with some track hurdles, because she was holding that pillow down with a lot of anger. She left the next day for wine coolers and never came back. I remember thinking that Marta would never be that kind of mother. She would be thin, hot, and would pack pudding cups for lunch. 
It was because of my house arrest that I didn't notice Marta's absence from school for three weeks. I called her house, Marta's best friend. As she read the note,  she wiped a tear from her cheek. She motioned for me to meet her outside, and we both made our excuses and met by her locker. ""I can't believe you don't know. Aren't you supposed to be her boyfriend or something?"" Normally, I would have given Riley the finger, and told her to piss off, but she was too valuable. I needed to know where Marta was now. I hadn't been to second base in over 3 weeks now! ""I'm dying here, and continued ""She was in a car accident last week, and Marta was thrown 15 feet. She's been in a coma ever since."" There is something inside you that changes the first time someone whose vagina you've touched becomes a vegetable. My Marta and her douche brother. How could he be so careless with such precious cargo! Marta didn't need sponge baths and a colostomy bag. She needed Wetzel's Pretzels, past the lunch room
The only reason I am alive today is because my father made a deal with the Devil ten years ago. The Prince of Darkness paid my dear old dad a visit on the night he decided to take a joy ride on his Harley while high on meth. I wasn't belted into his side car, I took the brunt of it. My Dad, a high, weeping mess on the side of the highway waited for the ambulance and held my lifeless bloodied body in his arms. He always tells it like he screamed aloud that he would do anything to keep me alive. He says he prayed to whatever God or Demon would listen and come to his aid. Cuffed in the back of a cop car, the Devil came to him in the form of his stout ginger arresting officer. ""I will spare your son's life if you sign your soul over to me for eternity"" he whispered in my Dad's ear. My Dad tells it like he didn't hesitate. He signed immediately, and I was saved. I know this isn't true. Partly because you never believe a dead eyed bartender who funnels souls to the Devil for a living, and second of all, she said to me ""Your soul is fair game,  if you ever want or need anything badly enough, dragging her still untied shoe laces with her. I think this is where my problem with authority started. Rules and regulations seem pretty inane when you already know that no matter what you do
I stopped off at home \to throw on the best disguise that I could come up with, but I know who and how to ask,"" he muttered in reply. He looked over at me, and for a moment tried to peer around my huge sunglasses.  I didn't register, and so he went about his task of summoning Beelzebub on his cell phone. As he made the call, to this day, I swear I saw him tear up, Marta made a full recovery, and I think if they heard the truth it would not surprise them.

I had a great idea just now

Whilst browsing /r/IAmA, OP must include 5 or more questions to be answered by whomever they requested.

These are the questions asked by OP of the thread linked above:

&gt;How did the tribespeople react to meeting a person(s) from the outside world?

&gt;Under what circumstances did you work with or encounter these tribes?

&gt;What was the interaction like?

&gt;Were these tribes friendly? Hostile? Both? And how so?

&gt;How did you communicate with the tribespeople

&gt;What language did they speak

&gt;What unique or otherwise interesting things happened?

&gt;Does the tribe(s) remain otherwise uncontacted to this day

Well, /r/WritingPrompts writers search through /r/IAmA for interesting threads for their characters to answer? This one requires more work on the part of the user, but the possibilities are endless!

Andrew looked at the slip of paper protruding from the slot. The note fluttered slightly against the breeze crafted by a noisy desk fan on table in the receiving room, brown eyebrows, down along the bridge of his wide nose, over the cut on his upper lip that never seemed to heal, to the stubbly chin  and off the the linoleum floor below. A short, yet audible gulp and a swift motion rent the white printout from its holder. It was crumpled into a ball and stuffed into a front pocket belying the cost of the information it held. This office was not a proper venue to examine the contents.

The building was, but the occasional visitor would still approach the door and press the button labeled ""Evaluation"". While the practice was considered to be as acceptable as it was reliable, the income generated was enough to keep the business going and the pockets of the authorities filled to keep them looking the other way. Results were based off of old, outdated equipment, relying on equal parts simulation and guesswork, but plenty of people were more than willing to hand over fistfuls of cash to have even a poor answer over none at all. People like Andrew who couldn't afford to do so, but to whom the situation wouldn't matter soon enough anyway.

The roads were empty, plaster, and paint than brick in places. A red sprouting tree on a makeshift State Notice canvas, once a symbol of protest, now a weathered relic of a battle long since lost. The New Life Brigade had frequently hijacked television and radio signals to preach to the Unclaimed before the ban on media. With their voices taken from them, the Doctors made short work of them; the war lasted five hours.

""GOD HAS JUDGED"" scribbled over a former store window. Father had assured all that the ""righteous"" would be spared from the Wrath. It didn't matter. The death didn't look anything but random. Those claimed by the sickness were labeled sinners, all eager to satisfy God's wishes.

Andrew sighed as he crossed another spray painted slogan. Ancient history, and the NLB was gone. There were far more serious problems at hand, not the least of which pertained to the slip of paper in his pocket.",Continuing Story,False,,t5_2s3nb,,http://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/1d5d5n/cs_you_shall_be_judged/

1349064695.0,10quy2,"[PI] September Contest - ""Baby""",hauntedsultan,13,3,0,"“And I was like baby, respect your government and authoritieeees

Elora Belle reached over and slapped the WR-183 Standard Regulation Alarm Clock Radio until it shut up. She HATED that song. What a way to start the morning, and the urge to lay back down was almost irresistible. Maybe just a few more minutes….

She closed her eyes and rolled over

“Breakfast is ready, so she put them on.

In the bathroom, Justin Beiber’s “Baby [Great Nation Remix].” The song had been remastered and reworded for its tenth anniversary, and the original lyrics had long since been lost in time. Elora was only five when the original song was released, but she always looked back on that period of her life with disgust. At one time, she had posters of him, and she screamed when he came on television. These days, Elora refused to watch television. She spent her time reading her father’s books. She was not a child anymore.

Even so, already at the table with her coffee, scowled. “Elora, you know how I feel about that song.”

Elora rolled her eyes. “The same way you feel about every song

Elora’s mother sighed, not old enough to remember when things were different, a time when real music was allowed and real expression was praised. Now it‘s all cranked out by the government machine. Once talent is spotted, they will find you. They will make sure you create beautiful art in the name of the state. “You do sing beautifully, though, dear.”

“Right, and writing, like Dad.”

“You and your writing. You have the same mind he does, they’ll lock you up for thinking the wrong thing. Be careful, Elora.”

Being careful was hard these days, thinking about her daughter as her coffee grew cold. “Things will be better one day. Someday things will be good again,” she mused sadly.

Elora was indifferent to her mother’s emotion. She flipped on the television. A female newscaster behind a desk told the story of how a new Cultivation Center had opened up in the town next door. “Elora

Elora sullenly refused to turn off the television. The female newscaster went on about the new Center, some were disruptive, some were defiant, but they all came out the same. 

And that’s why Elora was breaking her father out of that place. Tonight. After school. She had to. She didn’t want her mother to know because she would just worry. Elora knew that her mother would do it herself if she could

Elora’s mother, trying to ignore the lady on television. She had a way of blocking things out, forgetting about problems. Maybe the country wasn’t at it’s best right now. Maybe there were a few freedoms that disappeared over these last few years. Elora’s mother didn’t like the way things were. She didn’t like her daughter growing up in this sterile, political environment, but at least they had food and a place to live. And she knew better than to turn her angry thoughts into angry actions. She tried once more, feebly this time, “Elora

Elora saw the distance in her mother’s eyes. “Sorry Mom.” She got up from the table and left without another word.

School went by slowly that day. She mapped her path to the Cultivation Center again and again in her mind. It was about a mile walk from the school, her classmates were abuzz with news of the football game last night. Every high school football game across the country was taped and sent to the President. Athletics were an art form, and this Great Nation was built on it’s great art. At the end of each school year, a letter from the President was read over the school’s streaming broadcast system congratulating all the students on their achievements. Elora could only scoff. 

At dismissal time

“Yeah

A boy behind her commented, what do you think?”

Elora shrugged. “I don’t really watch

“You’re so weird

Elora’s heart pounded in her throat the whole walk to the Cultivation Center. Dad had left her a copy of the blueprints of the place before he got taken away. He had known it was only a matter of time, and it wasn’t the world Elora wanted either. She wanted him to be himself again, happy. She wanted her mother to relax again, she was tired of hearing about how great the government was. She didn’t want to say a pledge to the President’s portrait every morning at school. She didn’t want to play in the park under the watchful eyes of the Protection Guard. Elora had vague memories of Justin Bieber’s original lyrics, how she used to sing them into a hairbrush. 

Elora was walking faster than she should, she slipped through a gap in the chain-link fence. She knew exactly how to get in and where to go. She had to disable the electricity, set off the backup alarm, and then find her father. Or he would find her. 
He would He loved his baby girl.

She snuck along in the shade of trees to one of the outbuildings. Solar power provided electricity for the whole center

Elora looked around the back for a rear entrance. Also locked, and unlock the door. She needed something heavy, like a rock. Elora remembered seeing a large rock near the gate. She ran back silently, and found the rock right where she left it.

A few more minutes

As she bent down to pick up the rock

Elora fell backwards and landed on the ground, maybe a weapon.

Elora struggled to her feet and looked the man in the eyes. She was cunning. She could wriggle her way out of this. “First of all, yes. I belong here.”

“Then why aren’t you wearing your uniform?” the man asked. “You need to get inside right now and get yourself hooked back up to the system.

“Hooked up?” Elora asked

The man grabbed her shoulder roughly. “Well, but she stayed tough.

“I told you

The guard shoved backwards hard. He looked her up and down. “What do you call yourself?” he asked her.

“I’m Elora Belle

Suddenly, more gently this time. “Be honest with me, Ms. Belle. Do you really belong here?”

“Yes

The man chuckled slightly. “Well

“I did something very bad

“I’m Ellsworth

Elora didn’t trust him for a second. She stayed quiet. “Say, “you’re really pretty. How’s your singing voice?”  

Elora didn’t dare respond. “I bet you can sing really well

“You know my father?” Elora asked. This could be her chance. Get to Dad, the three of them. There’d be nothing to worry about.

“Yeah, right?”

She gathered up a little strength and shakily belted out the first few bars of Justin Bieber’s “Baby [Great Nation Remix], you could go far with that voice. Ever want to meet Justin Bieber himself? I bet I could hook you up. And hell, with talent like that, I bet you could even meet president Timberlake.

The fan girl buried inside Elora lit up for just a second,“ she was getting nervous, impatient. Had she already failed? She still had to try. “Can we go now?”

Ellsworth grabbed Elora by the shoulder again

“Sorry.”

Sooty waves whispered against the sides of the ship and Joel paced on.  When it came to natural biological components, he was *anxious*.  The navigators had said they would hit it two days ago and the computers verified the course.  The crew knew it, too, and just about everyone was walking around all antsy and bothered.  If he spent another day staring into nothing but this infinite fucking grey, he could start spending his nights planning for mutiny.  It was arse.  Every bit of it.

“Sorry.”

“Stop saying that.”

“Okay.”

Maybe they floated off somewhere.  Maybe they got all mashed up and there was nothing left but a giant dead crag rising out of the black waters like a nightmare.  Maybe the missiles struck and he was departing from one smoldering clusterfuck to discover a fresh one.  Maybe

“Shit.”

“**CURIOUS**, digital and absolutely impartial.  It was unsettling, and Joel never appreciated being unsettled.

“Stow it, maybe.  Lay all the shit out in his mind and look for the missing pieces.  “Actually, on second thought, play it again.”

“Heads up!”

Whirring, too-large arm shot forward through space.  There was a tremendous snap that made Joel think of some long-extinct creature he had only ever seen pictures of.  Alligators.  Or maybe it was crocodiles.

“And one second.”

The splinters clattered to the deck

“You know, I yearn for a time when a heinous, lumbering monstrosity such as yourself was the stuff of conspiracy theories and petty fiction.”

1348418664.0,10chjm,[PI] Barbara Allen - September Contest,Crumbford,10,2,1,"Bristol airport was deserted

The countries had been evacuated and almost all humans were out in space, some stayed because they couldn't afford the evacuation tax, some simply stayed. Those stranded scrimped and scraped their way along, nomadic tribes travelled through continents and sucked the last drops of dew they could find in order to survive. Farms were attempted but rarely succeeded, desert summers and benumbing winters tarnished the earth. In the most hostile places, China, the west coast of the Americas, it came in snow and ice, up and were held there until winter came again. Humankind lived on though, and that small island is where we set out scene.

Permeating through the silence came a cry, drifting up and down, bouncing around the frame of the airport. The echo shivered into a crack in the wall of what used to be a WH Smiths and disturbed a rat, it didn't like the sound but it was a brave rat. It scuttled out of the crack and along the ground floor hallway, following the sound like it was chasing a chunk of meat on an old piece of string. As it got closer the sound turned into words, very bargled and slurred words but words none the less, and if the rat could have understood


*It being the springtime of the year*

*The flowers were freshly blooming*

*A young man from my home country*

*Fell in love with Barbara Allen*



*This young man took sick and he went to bed*

*And he called out for Barbara Allen*

*She came to him and softly said*

*Young man I think you are dying*


*I am not dying! the young man said*

*One kiss from you would cure me*

*One kiss from me you'll never see*

*Though I thought that you're heart was breaking*


*Or do you not remember last Sunday night*

*Out in the ballroom dancing*

*You danced all night with the village whore*

*And you slighted Barbara Allen.*


As it turned out, he danced the dance of a damaged man, swinging his arms and legs as he staggered around in bare feet over broken glass and debris, a dance much too uncomfortable for a sober man. In his right hand there was a can of sterno and in his left there was a  rudimentary pistol. The sterno was perfume on his breath and the gun was lying loosely in his grip. It had been made with improvised materials, the only distinguishable component was the barrel which had been formed with an ornate silver candlestick holder, the rest of the gun was constructed with chunks of wood and modified nuts and bolts. The gun swung like a wrecking ball on the end of his arm, forth and back and forth again. The rat stood and watched curiously as the man flailed, why this man was acting so bizarrely


*So she went back to her father's house*

*And she heard the church bell tolling*

*And each toll that the bell did ring*

*Called out for Barbara Allen*


*Now she'd not gone back so very far*

*When she saw the funeral coming*

*Lay down

*So that I may gaze upon him*


*Oh father

*And dig it deep and narrow*

*A young man died for me today*

*I shall die for him tomorrow.*


The man finished singing and looked down smiling, its nose twitched as it smelt him, it really was very hungry. They both stood there staring at each other. The man, drunk, the rat, hungry. He noticed the colour of the rats fur, it was the same colour as his coat, like damp dead grass. The man raised the gun to his head and the barrel found his temple, it was as if he was on a stage the rat thought. His fingers squeezed the trigger of the gun

Year 2064 A.E.D (After Earth Death)

New Earth has no sun. We survive on geothermal and nuclear power. It isn't much

The energy is rationed. As a member of the lower class, 12 Kilowatt/hours of electricity, and 0.5 liters of fuel each day. The rich get more and the unemployed get less.

But to be fair, run the whole planet. They're programmed to act in our best interests. Nobody really trusts them, except maybe the Programmers, but we accept them because we have to. 

We were always intended to be the last hope of humanity. In case Earth, but by the time we arrived on New Earth the war was over. Both sides had lost. 

The Human Mech-Force had orders to exterminate the Enemy. They were trained well

But the Enemy had a dead-hand trigger. They took us out with them. The Red Button was pushed

When our ancestors arrived on New Earth, or eight enhanced-human lifetimes. 

We are part of the ninth generation. We have never seen a star. My father used to say they were beautiful.

**Chapter Two:**

Year 2065 A.E.D.

Announcements by the Programmers are not taken from my energy ration

""New regulations have been approved by the Programmer Council.""

The Programmer Council was nothing more than a formality. They approved every Computer Mandate to Save Energy. I wondered what 'wasteful practice' they would ban this time. 

""We have evaluated all possible scenarios

This was new. I listened closely.

""In a billion years, new energy sources, new life. Until then we just have to survive.""

""But at this rate of energy consumption we won't last a hundredth of that time. We have taken it for granted that we were to be the last dying gasp of human life. But a new scenario has been presented, we like it. And we hope you do as well.""

""The human body is remarkably inefficient. You waste the vast majority of your energy supply. You need a narrow set of thermal and atmospheric conditions to survive. And, we have been forced to reevaluate everything.""

""Beginning at 8:00 tomorrow, when you wake up tomorrow morning, you won't be able to tell the difference.""

""We sincerely hope that you submit to this change, the Programmers will help to assimilate you. Please don't resist. Resistance is futile, and it wastes energy.""

With another burst of static

**The Huntsman**

My parents told me not to go into the woods.  When I asked them why

When I was five, I heard a sweet song. I heard a beautiful female voice, singing:

*And so it was that later 
As the miller told his tale 
That her face
Turned a whiter shade of pale*

Instead of heading home, I decided she would be very pretty. I was not disappointed. When I found her, she was in a small clearing that the sun filtered into. The sunlight hit her white gown, making it look as if she was wearing pure sunlight. Her hair was raven black and curly. She was standing in the center of a circle of small, colorful toadstools. They were colors I had never seen a toadstool have before. Some were purple, some pink and one a brilliant, vibrant blue. Flitting around her were what appeared to be fairies - real life fairies!

She stretched her arms wide and continued to sing.

*One of sixteen vestal virgins 
Who were leaving for the coast 
And although my eyes were open wide
They might have just as well been closed*

She beckoned me to her. As I approached, I looked at her face. It was just as pale but now I noticed her teeth – all of them were pointy like incisors. Her eyes were a crimson red color and her ears were pointed. The fairies that had been flying around her had stopped flying. Some stood on her shoulder, some on her legs and arms. They had similar looking faces.

She smiled

To this day, it is larger game – boars and deer. I have tried to leave the woods but when I reach the edge of the wood, I am stopped as if I was bumping into an invisible wall.

1345477101.0,yiz4t,[PI] August Contest,Thatquietchick,10,2,10,"I hate her. 

I hate her beauty.

I hate the power she holds over people. 

I hate that she made me need her.

Less than two months ago she traipsed into my beginners psych class and set her plan in motion. I didn't know it back then-no one could have known-but she would have me eating out of the palm of her hands by the end of the week. She would toss her inky black curls and laugh at everything I said

At first I wondered why she picked me of all people. 263 seniors to choose from and she picked me. I was so happy I never stopped to think about how odd it was that I went from being a social pariah to eating lunch with football players in a week's time. I never acknowledged the way she clung possessively to my arm or how diligently she drilled the social do's and don't's of  high school into me everyday after school. I was just so happy to have a friend. To have *friends*. For once in my life I was the one everyone wanted at their party. The high of being wanted blinded me from the facts. 

They only wanted me around because I brought *her* with me

I could only sit at their table if *she* would be there to grace everyone with her exotic presence. 

They were addicted to her and so was I. She was irresistible. She was inhumanly beautiful. Whatever this girl was, it was done. If she wanted past to mean present and present to mean future, dictionaries would be rewritten. 

The worst part was that nobody ever questioned it. We just let her take over our lives and consume all of our thoughts from the moment she stepped her long legs through the door. Thoughts of her perfectly porcelain skin distracted us from wondering where she came from or why she lived alone. Thick, like who her parents were or what her last school was like. Nobody cared, though. She could have murdered her last class with rusted machete and they would still be falling all over themselves to be near her. She was easily the most exciting thing to happen to our school in years. Boys would fantasize about her well after graduation and girls would strive to be like her. For the rest of their lives, men and women would be unsatisfied after witnessing what a true beauty looked like. No matter how hard they tried to forget, she would burn in the back of their minds forever. Always reminding them of the kind of person they wanted be.

But they don't know her like I do. 

They weren't used like I was.

She dug her glossy black nails into my world and refused to let go until I was indebted to her. She showed me what life could be like. Life outside of video games and the library. She showed me how to really *live*. She made sure my phone was always ringing and my lunch table was always full.   Everyday I got a little bit closer to the life I'd fantasized about. A life with friends, and eventually a girlfriend. I didn't think it to be possible but after a month and a half of perfecting my life, she decided she wanted more. She didn't want to remain friends, she wanted the world to know that she was mine and I was hers. 

Then everything changed. 

She started asking for favors. Little things at first

Then she started asking for bigger things-*stranger* things. She demanded that I introduce her to my new friends. One by one I would introduce her to one of the new friends I'd made since she came

She drove for hours. She drove until the homely country houses around us were miles away and all we could see were trees. My friends never suspected a thing. And neither did I that first time. She was all smiles right up until the end like we really were going to a coffee shop. Like she didn't drive 20 miles deep into the forest with a polished knife gleaming beneath a flannel blanket in the backseat. Like she didn't plan to kill off my classmates one by one. 

The scary part is that I didn't even care. 

I just let her take my new friends away from me. I was already used to being alone anyway. And if she was kind enough

After seven trips people were starting to get suspicious. To tell you the truth

By the eight trip

So the day of the ninth trip I told her no. 

""What did you just say?"" Alice stood on my front porch with her arms crossed. God
""We can't keep luring people into your trap. It's wrong.""

""Have you forgotten what I did for you?"" 

I would never forget. I was so thankful for the way she changed my life

""Of course I haven't forgotten, I'm sure we can find out why you do these things.""

That was my first mistake.

I let her assume the role of victim. I gave her an excuse. 

Her eyes flahsed green for a moment and her skin once again adopted that powerful glow. As soon as I saw her stormy gray eyes well up and her bottom lip start to quiver

Alice leaned in for a hug and I hugged her back

My second mistake was getting into her car.  

And that's where we are right now. Just the two of us in the middle of the forest. 

Driving.

1344528913.0,xy155,[PI] The August Writing Prompt Contest - Creature,supergalacticcaptain,10,0,7,"For as long as he could remember 8 had been imprisoned in this cell. The faded grey walls had been his home

8 didn’t know what he was, he could never see through their masks. He stared at the mirror that extended across one entire wall of his cell, he glared intently into his own eyes, searching for answers, hoping they eluded him somewhere inside his own mind. As he slowly walked closer to the mirror his pupils contracted while the yellow iris reflected the light in the room.

He could always tell when there was someone behind the mirror he could hear them. Not physically, almost angry. His hands shook, the intensity was unnerving; he’d never felt it this strongly before. It’s as though every time she’d been in his cell before she’d been sedated to shield her emotions from him.

8 felt a tingling in his right hand and slight weight, desperate to try and rationalise what he saw. He realised he was sweating profusely he stepped closer to the mirror and raised an arm to wipe the sweat from his brow. As his forearm crossed his brow the entire cell was flooded with light again as he opened his eyes he saw his right hand clutching the blade once more as a thin line spread across his throat, opening wider as it progressed. The blood from the wound was almost black it was so thick; and as quickly as it appeared it was gone again.

It was only now he realised what was happening – They were planning on killing him. He had outlived his usefulness. The eternity of experiments had served their purpose. The constant operations

No. This can’t be it, she rounded the corner towards his door. She wasn’t alone, he could hear three men with her. They were aggravated, he could hear the blood pulsing through their veins, the blood lust was intoxicating.

The cold steel door slowly widened, the blade no longer than an inch. One lunged at him, he tried to step away from the blade but wasn’t fast enough; the blade sunk deep into his side, as he looked down he saw the circle of blood slowly spread across his ribcage.

*No.*

Suddenly he felt strong - angry. He grabbed his assailant’s wrist and looked the man who had just stabbed him in the eyes, but there was no escaping it. Slowly and with purpose he slowly pushed the blade into his own neck and dragged it to the side. The wound was deep, he started to sink to the ground as his shirt was drenched with his own blood.

The other two stopped their attack

Once out the door to his cell he was working on pure instinct, covered in strange writing and drawings. He raced along the hallway as fast as his body would allow, he came to a T-junction, both direction looked identical. This place looked easy to get lost in, he closed his eyes, listening for anything and anyone. There. To the left one person, they were faint, they felt weary. That was where he needed to go

The person at the end of the corridor wasn’t drowsy anymore, no wonder they were guarding the exit. No point in slowing down now as he got closer 8 dropped to the ground he started sliding along the ground to escape the guard. What would’ve been a perfect escape was quickly foiled by a boot landing solidly in his right wrist with a sickening – *CRACK* – the bone was clearly broken.

He felt that familiar surge the murderous anger surging though his chest.
	“Stop.” He barely recognized his own voice, the anger form his broken bone, the years of captivity boiling over. He stood behind the guard, slowly wrapping one arm around his next. He placed the palm of his hand on the point of the guards chin and clenched the side of his face with his fingers and wrenched it sharply to the left. The man fell limp immediately, 8 looked down at his lifeless body, he looked pathetic, eyes rolled back his head the bruising surrounding his broken neck already bleeding to the surface.

Purposefully 8 strode over the body and towards the guard office, the air smelled differently, the light was warm and welcoming. This is surely what freedom feels like.

No sooner had 8’s eyes adjusted to the light he saw a man standing a few feet away from him holding a long black weapon

My heart leapt into my throat. I already knew the fact of his death, it jolted me to think of him sitting at his computer, secure in his room, safely enclosed in my house and supposedly my protection, contemplating his death. My son. My blood. Had he known it was coming? Had he felt it, suspected it? I shook my head. No. These constant questions were encroaching further and further upon my sanity by the day.

“If this message remains unchanged by my age and my father is still the recipient rather than my wife I've yet to meet, so my heart aches for you. Especially as you don’t have Mum’s strength by your side.” 

I felt my teeth clench in a vain attempt to hold back the sudden swelling of pain that threatened to overwhelm me. Even when faced with the concept of his own death my son was thinking of others. I wondered if he ever really thought of himself

“I know how hard things have been since she died, we still love each other dearly. I know you tried to be strong for me - you were, you must believe me! But you could never see just how strong you truly were. I hope I was strong for you.” 

I nodded away like a marionette as I read, but it was all too much. They were too true. I could not be transported to that morning again. Nor that night.

I returned to myself, but please try not to feel guilty.” My stomach plummeted and I almost vomited its acrid, alcohol-soaked contents over the keyboard. I spun the chair around and away from the message to take several deep, calming breaths, focusing intently on the bare walls that were illuminated only by the glow of the screen. At one time they had been alive with posters of musicians and movies, awards for sport and science, photographs of young smiling faces whose laughter echoed through the years. But after his death I could no longer bear to see the life on those walls

I took another shuddering breath. Another. Okay

“Whatever you may think, you did all you could to prevent it. Please remember that. Thank you for everything, Dad. I love you.” 

It was all too much to bear, rip out the cables, destroy it all, do anything to make those words go away. I felt my hand knock the near-empty whisky bottle from the table and turned just in time to see it crack against the floor and spill the last of its dark amber contents. For an instant the cracked bottle became my son, and the whisky shone bright red as it leaked from his head. This time I could not control the convulsing of my stomach, and I stumbled in drunken, teary blindness to the bathroom.

I crouched there with my arms circling the toilet seat in a warped embrace, my guilt, my unforgivable sins. My son. My tiny bundle of joy, my little footballer, my growing student, my grown-up Bachelor of Science. 

Through everything

In all he wrote, I would never have lashed out at him. If my brain had not been pickled in whisky, I would have heard and understood the sound of a body tumbling down stairs and not dismissed it as the tantrums of a teenager that he no longer was. If my heart had not been drowned in grief, it would not have been so numb as to let me turn away and go to sleep after all that had happened that night. 

Through everything

My son. My only son. My torment.

*It wasn't the room that was the problem. It was a nice room: airy, had been for about ten minutes, and still he felt that awful itch under his skin, something was so very, very wrong ... but it wasn't the room. He wrapped his arms around his stomach and shivered, then noting how defensive it was quickly shoved his hands in his pockets. It didn't matter though, not really. There was no one in the room but him. The pleasant pale yellow walls were cheerfully mocking him. He hated this room. All he wanted to do was flee. He glanced to the doorway.*

*The perfect white paint looked fresh. It probably was, but it was new. It was a lie. It masqueraded as home. He shuddered again and took a step towards the open door. Only he stopped short. Out there was worse. Out there were the people masquerading as home. Pretending all of this was normal, natural, good even.

She woke up, bloody smell rose through the dark and she covered her nose, gagging when she realized her hand was covered in blood. ""What the-"" She fumbled in her jacket, feeling weights in them, and her slick fingers wrapped around a small flashlight. Metal scraped against metal for a moment and she pulled her hand out of her pocket, staring at her ring finger. Silvery with a small gem in it; couldn't begin to tell what it was in here though.

Her fingers twisted the end, she wasn't in any agony, but when she licked her lips she could only taste blood. Stomach clenching tight, she stood, boots surprisingly stable on the wet floor, and shined the flashlight into the room. It wasn't bright enough to see everything, but it was enough.

Splashes and puddles of the red liquid covered the room, ignoring the nausea that threatened to expel her stomach's non-existent contents, and boldly walked up to it. The words were spelled in finger-painted letters, dried to a dark brown.

*GET OUT EVELYN GET OUT OUT OUT GET OUT GET OUT*

Her head hurt, maybe? A chill ran down her spine as she stared at one of her fingers; a depression in it matched the void.

She needed to get out. Now.

Cursing under her breath, a window, a vent - and her hand wrapped around a doorknob. Relief flooded her and she opened it. 

Brilliant white light flooded in, hundreds of cops with their guns aimed directly at her. 

""STAND DOWN!"" The voice was shrill for a man's, aiming the gun behind her before he turned to her.. 

""Go on, confused, but obliged, walking forward. The little flashlight fell out of her hands unheeded as a tall, dark-skinned man ran up to meet her, grasping her arms gingerly.

""Lynn, you are in *forensics*, you stay in your fucking office!"" She couldn't place his accent; deep, rasping, foreign. She simply stared at him, shell-shocked, and the anger dissipated from his eyes before he hugged her tight. ""I thought I lost you

""...w...who are you?"" Her throat hurt

""Lynn, something. You know me."" He cupped her face in his large, warm hands and her lip trembled. She *knew* him, but *dammit,* who was he? ""It's Alexei, Lynn. *Please*.""

""P...please help me."" She dropped her head against his chest, heading towards one of the ambulances waiting on the far side of the swathe of officers.

She woke up, she could feel it: the dried flakes were gone and she could definitely feel the rough scratches of the loofah still scouring her skin. In the crook of one arm was a soft object and she squeezed it carefully; oh, just a teddy bear. She sighed and rested her head against the pillow, squinting at the TV. News reports of someone called the Painter echoed in her ears, but she couldn't make sense of it.

Her eyes drifted shut, the door opened. The man - Alexei - stepped... no, stomped was a better word, she mused. He wasn't a small being and his footsteps were heavy. He sat next to her and grasped her hand in both of his, kissing his fingertips. ""Sweet mother of God, Lynn, I thought I *lost* you to that fucker

""..."" Her heart ached and she wasn't quite sure why. ""Who.... who took me?""

""The Painter."" His voice hardened. A twitch in her brain broke something free - he was a Russian

""Alex-"" He looked up at her, at last, the ring on her finger. It matched the one on his left ring finger. ""... You're my husband. I... I'm s..."" She inhaled, eyes welling up. ""I... Oh god, what happened to me?""

""You were working late and decided to revisit the park crime scene."" He rested his arms on the bed,"" he said. ""You don't have a single scratch on you, dammit, and we don't know why.""

""Maybe I'm a fighter?"" She winced

""The scans say your vocal cords show signs of overuse."" He looked down at her hand. ""We found the note that was in the room. Your... Your fingerprints are all over it."" He closed his eyes. ""We're still not sure what's going on.""

""Who's Evelyn?"" Her free hand found the adjustment panel and elevated the bed

""You. Your full name. I've never called you by it."" He leaned in and kissed her softly on the cheek. ""The Chief wants you to see a psychologist.""

""Oh. Okay."" She blinked. ""... Why would I write a note to myself if I was the only one in the room?""

""That's what we're hoping to find out."" He smiled weakly. Stress lines wrinkled his face

""I will be

""That's the Lynn I married."" He kissed her again before leaving his chair. ""I'll be out in the hall. Just shout if you need me.""

""I will."" She smiled at him. That even hurt

She relaxed against the bed

She wanted her mind back. As she tried to sleep again, she waved with an air of annoyance, and dropped it on the side table before leaving. With a grunt, she grabbed it - damn it was heavy! - and sat it on her lap, picking at the brown paper cautiously. 

Her breath caught in her throat at the sight of the box inside. An old music box adorned with Gaelic letters and Celtic knots sat in her lap

A folded piece of paper slowly peeked out of the contraption, and her heart dropped.

""TEN HOURS

She screamed.

Banners in red and silver repeating these 6 words were strewn over the entirety of our school. Two stories that had once been a brown brick color and been torn down and replaced with a pure white marble three story building

 The new government had decided to tear down all public schools and institute larger, little me!	 


Thinking back, the conservative became more and more conservative and the liberals shifted further left. America was left torn down the middle the exact year my friends and I were graduating. Which brings me to how this ridiculous situation came to be: out of the madness and killings that had swept our divided country came a single candidate who claimed his main focus would be education. His words came out beautifully and he won the election in a landslide. The rest is history. 

""Name

“Anastasia Romanov.”

 I replied as he typed the name quickly into his handheld device. A hologram popped up and showed my information. Every single yearbook pictures, resume, and SAT and ACT scores, how the hell did these guys get all this information!? 

“Top 15%,” the security guard recited as he roughly shoved papers into my hands. 

I just graduated and I’m back in high school. Great.  


I stare down at the red carpet as I walked down the hallway. Don’t trip. Don’t trip. Don’t trip. To say I had coordination problems would be an understatement. Wait! Who’s that? Mid-height, with light brown eyes! BORIS! I run as fast as I can across the ridiculously plushy red carpets that lined the hallway. Suddenly I feel my heel get caught in a lose thread, a small imperfection in this stupid carpet. It tugs at my leg and I crash down face first into the carpet. THUMP.  I head a sigh. Peaking up from under my long black hair I see shiny black shoes. 

“I thought maybe with graduation you’d gain some balance

“I thought maybe with graduation you’d grow some facial hair!” I retort as I pull myself up from the floor which is now thoroughly stained with the remains of my dignity. 

“That hurts.” He jokingly says. 

I look into his eyes and hug him. 

“It’s so great to see someone I know here! I have to go to the nurse.” I say rushed. 

Boris nods and says casually

We start walking down the hall searching for other familiar faces as it slowly fills. 

“This is like prom. Everybody is all dressed up. Except no one is happy and everyone looks scared.” I say out loud to Boris.  

“They should be. The government is a real threat now.” “Why are you here? I expected you

“I haven’t seen or hear from Alexi since the election. No one has. I suspect he was caught trying to film the riots and he is in prison. Andrew has too much honor and he expects to figure a way to have a high ranking job now that everything is based on grades. Plus he has unsettled manners with you

I stop at a mirror to reply my lipstick

“I’m here to graduate.” 

Boris rolls his eyes as he opens the heavy iron door for me to enter the nurses office. 

“Whatever you say…Succubus.”

1347345382.0,zp4fk,[PI] Quota - September Contest,Wranlon,11,1,0,"
The herds were thinning, measured in kilo of crop-fed prol.  Stupid prols lapped up taint as though the poison sweetened the grass.  Rancid meat wouldn't save them.  Herds must be culled of taint.  If meat wouldn't fill one quota, it could fill another.

Murdet adjusted the plastic mask to sit the groove worn into his cheekbone.   He tightened worn straps, he spun the volume dial to zero.

""Quota

The prol stirred in its stall, and he swung a second time.  That kept it quiet.  Following a third strike the prol ceased flailing. Blood trickled from its mouth, spurted from the neck wound. 

Murdet removed a litmus strip and soaked it in blood.  The fibers turned golden yellow.  The prol had ingested taint, and then left the stall.

He had entered the barn alone, and then remembered to increase the volume.  He announced himself as ""Skag Murdet.""

Someone departed the stall, and a machete on their hip.  Under the layers of shiny and blood spattered plastic hid a man or woman, but Murdet could not tell which.

""Skag Murdoch

Murdet

Murdoch offered a bundle.  ""Quota?""  Its electrolarynx resonated an octave higher than his

Bile rose in Murdet's sternum, ""'Quota.""  Then he sank the rusty machete into Murdoch's skull.  The blade split through the plastic and into strings of oily blonde hair. Murdet removed his filet knife, cut off the plastic and made haste butchering the loins and haunches.  Momentarily his hand hovered near her torso, wondering how human women might differ from men.  So far the body looked atypical. He clenched his fingers into a fist.  It didn't matter.

Murdet plucked the registry from the skag's pocket, no longer.

Now

He double checked her registry.  New? In the back page he found a folded square of registry sheaves.  Not that new.   He scratched out the mark of taint from his last entry and marked in her estimated weight.  Her kilos

He stripped the remains of the skag uniform from the corpse.  Again he felt curiosity over its physique

Murdet carried the ripped clothes, hers wrapped in dingy white plastic, his wrapped in her plastic pantlegs.  He took hold of the wooden handles and wheeled the cart across the pastureland towards the distant town.

The blight was cold; flakes of gray snow fell through its noxious cloak.  Murdet stopped here and there to pull up a cluster of mushrooms.  This pasture was largely unworked

The prols stooped, judging by the way the plastic hung loose around their obliques and stretched across distended stomachs.

Murdet scooped up the mushrooms he'd harvested and tossed them into the rocky furrow.  ""Quota.""

One of the prols picked up a mushroom, turned it over in its hand, and then tossed it back on the ground.

""Quota

It shook its head

""Quota!""

It stretched the plastic to reveal its rib-lined scrawny torso.  Then it held its hand near its mouth and shook its head.  It couldn't speak. Neither could.  They didn't have an electrolarynx, and it refused to eat.  Smart prol.  No point culling untainted and stringy meat.  Not enough kilos.  He took Murdoch's mask and coat from the cart, and tossed them at the prol's feet.

The prol who'd refused to eat picked up the mask and weighed it in its hands.  Its fingers lingered over the electrolarynx.  Then it peeled its mask from its head and donned Murdoch's.  A tuft of brown hair protruded through the split.  It made a noise through the higher-pitched electrolarynx.  ""Aaaagghh.""

Murdet tweaked the octave down one click, he said ""Quota.""  Then, he removed a small canister from his pocket and spritzed the other prol's face with musk, a vitamin-infused barbiturate. And, such was all the instruction a new skag needed.

Then he took up the wooden cart arms and continued pushing the load to town.  Closer to town the pastureland bloomed with assorted mushrooms flecked by blighted snow.  Prol calves scampered amidst a herd tending the crop.  Skags circled the field, encircled it, and escorted it back to the center.

At the crossroads between field and the few dilapidated buildings compromising the town

Murdet lowered the cart handles and said

The skag didn't respond and continued holding out the strip.  Murdet reached for it but the skag retracted its hand. Then Murdet unfastened his mask

It shook the fiber in the air and then held it up to a second skag.  In the past

Whatever the color meant, and escorted him to a nearby barn.  Inside, four prols surrounded Murdet while the skags went outside and took possession of his meat.  The prols began to strip Murdet, starting with his mask, and then his jacket and boots.  They unbuttoned his single-piece undergarment and rolled it down to his ankles. 

Naked, and soonafter relaxation unclenched his muscles.  A prol fastened a collar around his neck, tied a cord to it, and led him by the cord to a stall.  There the prol tied the cord to an iron rung on the wooden wall.  At the back of the stall stood a strange looking human whose eyes oozed aggression.

The prol held up a small vial attached to a needle.  It touched an electrolarynx against its throat and its lips moved

Murdet tried to pull away but was held fast by the collar.  The strange human approached, but the musk and the jab made him feel woozy.  Warm.  Tingling. The strange human was behind him now, grunting.

The prol put its hand on Murdet's shoulder, and followed through with a fiery strike straight into his stomach.  The strange human lunged over his back, and the prol held Murdet's lead in a tight fist.  When the strange human ceased moving, it separated and retreated to the back of the stall.

The tension eased on the lead

The prol's electrolarynx emitted a garbled sound

Musk didn't induce sleep, and afterwards the prol followed the musk with a warm pile of mushroom mash ladled directly on the ground.

After three more days of being chained to the wall and being mounted by the strange human, and lowered the fabric over his body.  It held up a register with ten empty circles, pointed to the first, and then touched Murdet's stomach. It said,

So lets take inventory, born and raised in Oakland, California to be a humble, honest, and hard working man. I have a girlfriend, her name is Samantha Davies and she is very smart and very pretty and very aware of how powerful a combination that is. We're going to move in together next month because I just got a promotion at the office and can afford a house with backyard because she wants a dog. I hate dogs, I love Samantha. My best friend is Beau Lombardy and we're very different because he's in a band and wears flannel where as I'm a businessman and wear suits. He lives in an apartment with his bandmates

See, and I like simple because it makes sense and I can put it into a list and I've always found comfort in a good list.

But then Beau comes over unannounced on a Thursday, so I let him in and smile when he seems excited about something.

 ""Today is the day

Beau's looking all too pleased with himself and my first thought is that this means I will be needing more than one cup of coffee to be awake enough for work tomorrow.

 ""What's happening today?"" I ask.

 ""I'm popping your cherry! I've decided that I cannot go a day more having a best friend who I haven't dropped with."" 

Beau smiled that contagious smile that had gotten me into trouble a million times before. I can honestly say that every story I have about trouble has started with Beau smiling.

 ""Come on Beau, I've just never felt compelled to do much beyond beers at the bar every week. I'll also be the first to admit that I smoked more than my fair share of pot in college, but outside of dorm life I never cared all too much.

 ""You know what, God is telling me to do drugs with you. This is beyond me, orders from upstairs.""

 ""And just where in the Bible does it say that?"" I asked with a laugh. Beau liked to talk out his ass.

 ""Dunno, but I'd always liked how he could think like that. He was like a little kid in his mind sometimes still. I was jealous of that, he never had to do things like take aspirin because working through his personal finances never gave him headaches. But, now that I think about it he's probably never even used the phrase personal finances.

 ""I don't think so Beau

 ""Listen Jonah

 ""Jonah, it's time to undue the tie and loosen up for a bit! Lets celebrate that promotion you worked your ass off for!""

He rounded off his little speech with his pouty puppy dog face that I'm ashamed to say works as well on me as it does the girls who fawn over his band. I sighed and looked at him for a moment; he was right

 ""You just had to come on a Thursday

 ""Good on you

He reached over a clapped me on the shoulder with one hand while reaching into the inside pocket of his beat up blazer with the other

 ""Just put it on your tongue

 ""Now what?"" I asked.

 ""Now

Beau and I talked for a while

 ""Ummm... Beau?"" I asked quietly

 ""Yeah dude?"" Beau's voice was watery

   ""Are you where I am?""

   ""Yeah man

Beau started laughing and it was melodic

The world stopped moving when the ground was white and rocky, like there was no artificial light to pollute the skies, just stars and God in heaven.

   ""It's beautiful, watching, expecting to hear Beau make some sort of sound in agreement. I heard nothing and looked over to find myself alone. Weirdly enough, this didn't bother me. Nor did I feel compelled to move, to seek anything or anyone out, I'd probably just get lost in this place as it is.

And that's when I started to think, about myself and the world and life and what the hell am I doing here and why am I doing it and who am I doing it for and is there a point to doing it and why and why and who and what and where and why and how and how and how and who am I?

That last one stopped the racing of words through my mind. Who am I?

   ""I'm an alien."" I whispered to myself before breaking out into laughter

   ""I'm am alien!"" I shouted
So there I was

And that's when the thinking got weird again. I'm an alien here

   ""I'm... an... alien?"" I said it aloud without the realizing I was speaking or even thinking those words

 ""I am an alien."" I said it more surely this time

   ""I am a fucking alien!""

And it was true! I am a fucking alien! Think about it, creative, parties, all the things I made myself believe I couldn't be without sacrificing success and he's doing just fine! Hell he's got a certain joy that even I don't have when I'm with Samantha.

Samantha

Hell

I am an alien
 
   ""Shit."" A voice cut through my thoughts and in a blink I was back in my living room with Beau's sitting next to me and staring away.

   ""What?"" I asked.

There's a chirping sound, and his eyes meet mine.

“What was that?” I say.

“There's a bird in my house. Has been for a few days.” Harry takes a sip of his coffee

I nod. “You sure it's not the battery on the smoke alarm?”

Harry nods back. “Checked the battery. Carbon monoxide too. It's a bird.”

“Why don't we go find this bird?” I say

“Don't think I haven't tried

I've risen. “We can have a look around. It can't hurt.”

“Speak for yourself.”

Harry gets up, inside and outside. He looks brittle as he stands, and half-shuffles past me out of the lounge.

“You know, and he's a smart guy too.”

“I don't need a doctor, and I follow. He turns on the light, and I look in the cupboards, even though the bird's obviously not in the kitchen. They're almost empty.

“Hey

“Mhmm?”

“When's the last time you went shopping

“I got a food order in last week. From that grocery service.”

“I see.” I peek in his fridge. “You want me to take you shopping tomorrow

“Aw

“But you acknowledge that you need to get some food in your house

“In principle

“Just get some food into the house

We check his bathroom upstairs, and the bathroom is a mess. The laundry room is empty of laundry.

I go to open the study door

“We have to check

“We don't

I sigh. “That's obviously where the bird is.”

Sure enough, expecting recognition, but it's like he doesn't see me. He's just staring at the door.

“Look,” I say.

He doesn't react.

“Let's just go back downstairs. Come on.” I turn my head to make sure Harry follows me

We're back in the lounge. I reheated the coffee

I glance at my watch. The bird chirps again. “Harry

“You know

“I know.”

“Well, but you don't. I'd wake up every morning, and even before I opened my eyes, I knew I was the luckiest man in the world. I'd hold her close, and I didn't let go until I was good and ready. It didn't matter what happened that day. I had my love to keep me warm. She was the most wonderful woman in the world, and I was just blessed to be with her for as long as I was. Truly blessed.”

He has to take a breath

“I don't know if she ever loved me, I loved her with all of my heart. I loved cooking with her, laughing with her, just being with her made me light up. Everything used to be so bright. Her eyes used to shine, like emeralds.”

He takes another deep breath

“I miss her

We sit in silence

“Harry

He waves his hand. “I dunno...”

“Why not head out and check it? Maybe you got a bill? Maybe a letter?”

He shakes his head

“Harry

“Fine

The bird chirps. I grimace

“Besides

“Maybe

“I'll hold down the fort while you're gone

He gives me a weird look

I stand

I head up the stairs, the laundry room.

I stop at the study door. Hand on the doorknob. The fucking bird chirps again. I turn it. It opens

I see the bird immediately. It's a big sparrow, pull the latch, and open the window. There's a breeze, and the curtains fly up. The bird makes a hasty escape. I close the window, and turn to survey the room.

It's not so big. It's got a big window, and the curtains are all right too. There's a picture of Celia with Harry on the wall - Harry's taken all the others down. I take it all in, trying to put off noticing that there's a letter on the desk.

It's written in pen, sit down, and read the letter.

This is what it says.

&gt; Harry

&gt; I hope you're happy. Because this is your fault.

&gt; I know why this happened. It's because you wanted to watch me die. You used me, Harry. I hope you're happy. You're a fucking user and you always will be.

&gt; I don't know how you ignored my pain

&gt; I hate you. I really do. I want you to know that there has never been a moment on this earth where I have not hated you. When you stole me from my life, watched me die, made me poison myself so you could use me just a bit longer. I hated every minute of our time together.

&gt; I hate you I hate you I HATE YOU.

&gt; You deserve this more than I do. I don't deserve this pain. So I'm going

&gt; You don't deserve the love you stole from me.

That's what it said.

I take the letter. I read it again. And again. I walk out of the study, and the bedroom, down the stairs. I walk into the kitchen. I turn the stove fan on, and I put the burner on high. The blue flame flickers to life.

I hold a corner of the letter over the flames, hear it hiss. The smoke winds upwards, into the fan. I run the water for a bit, wash the ashes down the drain. I turn off the stove, and the fan. Walking back to the lounge, I turn on the record player. Nat King Cole sings in Spanish. I sit in Harry's armchair, and watch the dust motes dance in the last sliver of dusk.

A few minutes later

“I did have bills. Is this Nat King Cole?” he says.

The roll cage buckled to the left of my head, and I was forced by instinct to turn my head right.  I saw Bethany leave me.  She still had her seatbelt on, and was still in the car, but her neck turned a way it shouldn't have.  She was gone because I didn't want to listen to that damned song.  
&gt; 	On the third, my head rolled backwards to face Lacie.  I didn't witness her leaving because it had already happened.  Her eyes rolled with her head, not looking at anything in particular.  Her mouth was agape, but not with awe or suprise.  The muscles had relaxed because there was no nerve control.  My beautiful, brilliant, blonde-haired blue-eyed daughter was gone before we entered the third roll.

--------


It was my family who suggested I come out here. They kept insisting I 'take a vacation, Wisconsin.

I sat in a lawn chair, if the cooler was still full by then I'd have a great view of it over the lake.

My family was good to me. When I got out they didn't give two shits where I'd been, well on her way to a good job, adoring husband, and church once or twice a month. I wasn't the first to serve time in my family. First in a while, but I had something to talk about with my older relatives. 

Don't get me wrong, and the second coming the other. Like it was only a week ago I crushed the SAT and everything was looking up. My dad treats me like a kid, not a 25 year old ex con. I know they do it out of love, but still.

Whatever

I used to go out into the old neighborhood

Didn't see any of them, Oscar was still working a register at McDonalds. He didn't recognize me and I didn't bother. The corner boys and bar flys were new to me. Just kids trying their best to be a bad ass and failing terribly, like I used to be.

Well, the real world ain't shit.

Somewhere a bird flew through the treetops. I decided it was a hawk when I caught a glimpse of it. I watched it glide through currents

There were so many stars out here. Still shocked my city boy sensibilities every time I saw that. The woods were so dark

Mary was gone. I knew that four months into my sentence, no surrender"" did in the face of cold beds, a pill addiction and a broken home.

But listen to me decide who wins and loses. No friends, no steady job and one strike out of three. Oh yeah, I never really managed to get my life in order, piss and vinegar oaths of redemption be damned. 

I figured the polite thing to do was to call and offer congratulations, I'm a convicted fuck up, Andrew Johnson was president after Lincoln, what's your fucking point? It don't matter to me now.

That's the crux of it really. I have no plans because nothing excites me. It all just is. I don't improve my standing because whatever comes

The fire was out now and I'm pretty sure I missed half the cans I chucked in. I didn't like leaning my head back to look at the stars

I kinda miss the guys I did time with. Assholes the lot of 'em

I don't think prison ever really leaves you

It's the hitch between the shoulder blades, anyway.

You ever seen a guy who's kicked the H? It's like that. They function fine but watch them for a few minutes, walking into a gas station with a shotgun and enough perc in your system to not feel it when you get plugged in the back, but still planning to take your date to the movies tomorrow. Next day your only concerns are fighting hard enough to not end up dead or somebody's bitch. Then six years of that are over and you're back, an old man of 24 expected to play nice with the world. No one gives a shit what made you who you are, but you better change right quick. Not that they'll ever see past those three lines on your record.

I plunged my hand into the cooler but it was empty. I sat and smoked in the dark for a while, praying I wouldn't be back in prison for the next six hours.",Prompt Inspired,False,,t5_2s3nb,1376115574.0,,

*Son, I probably died however people said I died, so don't worry that I was actually assassinated by the Mafia or any other such nonsense.*

*Actually

*In the old copy, such as your mother, brothers, and sister. Other items of emotional and sentimental value were distributed as seen fit.*

*There are some issues with this

*1. My actual estate is far greater than what is listed in the will that you received.*

*2. Your siblings and mother are good for nothing. I was aware for a long time that your siblings were straying to a worse side of life, both of which they were ungrateful for.*

*I know you disliked me for keeping them under my roof, till the very last moment, that they could change. Because you are reading this, apparently,that did not happen.*

*I, declare this to by my Last Will and Testament, and revoke all other wills and codicils previously made by me.*

*I declare my lawyer, and ask that he be permitted to serve without Court supervision and without posting bond.*

*I give the entirety of my estate

* *My multiple bank accounts
* *My stocks and shares in Google, Microsoft, and Apple, netting at the moment of writing over twenty (20) million dollars*

* *My property at 604 Cutter's Way

* *My property at 64 Linden Ave

* *My business and engineering shop in Chicago

*To my son

*None of my estate will be given to anyone else under any other circumstance.*

*The full copy of my Last Will and Testament is in the possession of my lawyer

*Michael, then he may act and you'll collect my estate. I ask that you try to keep this secret for as long as possible, because it is entirely likely that your family members will try and sue for possession, thankfully made impossible by Joshua.*

*Live a happy life
