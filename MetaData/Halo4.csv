I’ll put *’s next to the biggest issues that need to prioritized first.

Generics:

* *When a game is created and starts, they can’t even join the game, they sit in the lobby as if our game is full.

* Medals really need to be cleaned up, getting one kill, and seeing 4 medals pop up on my screen. It completely takes away the actual reward for doing something great. In the postgame top medals section, the medals need to be sorted, right now my rampages are being hidden by my generic kills and my overkills are being covered up by my headshots.

* Armor Unlocks: The Stars are all backwards

* Spartan ID: When it says New ID’s unlocked, so if you press B it should go back to what it was, right now it just goes to whatever you left it on.

* Boltshot: This secondary weapon that people spawn with should not be a one shot kill

* *There needs to be a ranking system ASAP

Game Modes:

Regicide: Let people play real FFA

* *CTF: One HUGE problem is not being able to drop the flag. It's a huge problem and has been game ruining(single game) for me. I understand not wanting people to struggle picking up the flag in those close situations with vehicles/weapons on the ground. You might not want people to juggle/pass the flag

* *CTF: Another huge problem with CTF is that you are rewarded for suiciding your way across the map, it just automatically goes into your hands.

* *Oddball: The maps are extremely unbalanced, on complex for example, someone who spawns on the upper side gets a huge advantage of not only being closer to the ball, but having time to setup and sit back and shoot while someone else can go and grab the ball and just throw it back if they are about to die.

* *Slayer Pro: It’s the closest thing you have to competitive matchmaking right now. There's no excuse to have instant respawns and assault rifles involved. I don’t think instant respawns should be ANYWHERE in this game

* Oddball, Team Objective used to be one of the most solid playlists.

* Big Team Slayer should just be Big Team Battle and include CTF and maybe some other gametypes

* There really isn’t a solid playlist yet (the most consistent being Flood), MLG, and a few others.

Like I said

I will edit as more things come up.

EDIT: Weapons should not despawn so quickly. It's ridiculous how fast they go.

EDIT2: ~~FFA~~ and Team Snipers added

The split second after you hit Y to switch weapons toggle your light shield on and off quickly. When you release the light shield your secondary weapon will be out thus skipping the time and animation it takes to switch and the need for dexterity which is slower than this trick anyways. 
I find this kinda cool if you are set up with fire power, suppresser, storm rifle, frag grenade.

 I still get confused with the Halo count at the end of *Cryptum*. 
The general consensus is that there were the 12 original Halos, especially considering that the original 12 Halos were 30,000km in diameter.  This also explains the ""shortening"" of Installation 07 in the events of *Primordium*.  This gives us the 7 -  10,000km Halo network from the games.

I'm keyyys, but I would like to do weekly loadout challenges for you guys, much like /u/Almkrona has been doing over in /r/truetf2.

Here's the idea: Each week, or any other loadout option. However, I'll probably stick with Weapon and AA since they are the most game-changing.

to copypasta from /u/Almkrona's thread:

**RULES**

* You have to play with this challenge loadout item for at least 1 hour

* You can't change loadout in the middle of the challenge

* You can use it in any playlist (that allows loadouts)

**The Storm Rifle**

The ""spiritual successor"" to the plasma rifle, but may seem to fall short on the *killing* aspect which is, after all, what halo is all about.  
I haven't seen this weapon used nearly as much as the Assault rifle in game

* Note that you don't necessarily have to make this the only weapon you use

I'm also using the storm rifle because of the ""Fully Automated"" weekly challenge. Hopefully this will give you a chance to try out a new weapon *and* get some challenge XP!

**After you have played with the storm rifle for an hour

I made a map that I named Failsafe.  It is on my fileshare and is designed as a damaged spaceship docked at an abandoned research facility.  The idea behind this map was to have a great deal of Dominion and Extraction activity take place on the ship as the crew tries to initiate repairs and activate the internal defenses.  Infection and slayer gametypes will take place on the map as infected survivors (and infected non-survivors) attempt to hijack the ship.

Each section of the ship is color coded.  Blue for the Bridge, red for the walkway/docking clamp, and yellow for the space station.

I haven't finished loading out the map with power weapons and I haven't finished deploying spawn points on the space station.  At this time I am looking for feedback on the balancing of Spawnpoints for Dominion, and Infection.

Anyone wishing to take a look and give some constructive feedback after playing a few games; please feel free to download the map from my fileshare. 

 GT: CommissarHybrid
Map Name: Failsafe

A disclaimer...  I wanted to see what a Dominion game would feel like played in...  A confined space.  Please let me know how you feel about the automated turrets being used on this map.

I took a Binary rifle to the face the other day from a buddy who was cloaked and perched up on a rock on the Abandon map.  Prior to getting painted by a red triangular beam followed by complete disintegration; I caught a glimpse of how creepy and Predator-like the kill was.  Now that the giddy 12 year old within me has awakened by some of the cool features the H4 sandbox has to offer, railguns (upgrade) and swords for the full Yautja effect.
    
TL;DR - Is there a way to custom create a kickass Predator game type which meets (or comes close) to the criteria below?

- Two Teams (Predators vs. Marines)
- Preferably not Red and Blue
- Two Preds on a team max vs. at least 6 marines (3/1 ratio)
- Predators need: Primary: Binary Rifle, Good Camo, Unlimited Promethean Vision
- Marines need: Assault Rifles, Pistols, knives, sharp sticks... (Maybe 2 loadouts to choose from?)  
- Needs to be round based (1 life per player) 3 Rounds (objective = survive)

If I use the ""Flood"" Gametype as a template like everyone else
If I use a Regicide or Juggernaut game type as a template then there would only be one Pred with no regulations on loadout selection
What are some of your thoughts for a Predator vs. Marines game type?
Does anyone have one created?

My latest and greatest map is called AIR-DEFENSE. It's set up for extraction based on ""Impact"" This ship type structue is attacking the smaller island(of the two on Impact"") which has structures and ""Anti-Air Cannons."" If nothing else its pretty fun to explore!!!!!!


Looking at my file share now and realizing that it could be confusing recomendations are:

-fig8dom -built on impact blocks in the shape of figure eight

-dominion-Forge island

-barrel of monkeys- Impact- Ship build from station pieces is docked on space/base/island/thing. pretty sweet idea

-TP - medium slayer mape 2-6 players. teleporters, rocks, buildings, and a hidden saw in the center are all on this square arena.

Airdefence- so proud. please try.

Cylinder- older map built on impact around circle base on bigger island. its a big cylinder with walkways and what not
Yall better respond now. I just spent alotta time typing this up.

  I switched to bumper jumper in H3 for the ability to jump and aim at the same time. This was a serious edge on competitive play or at least I felt a serious difference. My problem with bumper jumper is that my armor ability is now on (x) meaning I can't use my armor ability and aim at the same time. This puts me at a serious disadvantage when trying to use light shield or jet pack. 

So to use either of those abilities optimally I would need to have my armor ability on the bumper

I have found this to be a great advantage in all of the following Halo games as many players seem to freeze up when you are able to consistently jump and accurately hit them at the same time. Some people might say the introduction of Armor Abilities in Reach evened the controls out a bit since it essentially made Jet Pack useless with Bumper Jumper because you couldn't aim while holding the 'X' button but I disliked that ability anyway and used Evade or Sprint almost exclusively. Most of my friends use either Default or Recon which don't seem to offer much upside outside of them being used to these controls and I constantly try to convince them to switch (it took me all of 10 matches to become very comfortable using Bumper Jumper).

1364672396.0,1bbfhr,Looking Ahead,,13,7,7,"I'd like to not rant. I know people hate rants unless everyone's heads are in line with each other. But here's a few things I'd like to point out based on recent events. 



* **343 is trying to catch the ball they dropped.**



By this, they gave us Forge Island (a couple days early, as you all know). They implemented the ability to balance weapons based on community input. 


* **Spartan Ops is likely not returning.**



I'd like to know the reason for 343 investing so much time and effort into Spartan Ops



I know people will disagree on this



I was expecting this to continue



* **Execution of promised fixes has been sloppy and slow.**



The File Browser was a mess at launch. Long story short



Many gametypes are still MIA. Grifball came back



We were all so excited by the return of the infamous ""Red X"". I actually laughed when I saw this feature return in Matchmaking. First of all



Weapon balancing will now commence thanks to the recently added backend tuning system



Now that we know that CSR will only be available via Halo Waypoint, I have to call bullshit on not being able to view CSR ingame because of limitations. 



I believe 343 doesn't want players getting scared of seeing a bunch of 50 ranked players on the other team and leaving. Well, **no one would leave unless they recognized a gamertag on the other team.**



TL;DR: Too bad. Read it. 



So
 


After all that, a relatively stable game and it is *good*. I refuse to give it better than that until the big issues are resolved and we see people coming back to the servers again. 



/end rant.

I got Halo 4 for xmas and tonight is the first time i put it in the xbox

I went into the campaign menu and it looked like somehow both 'prologue' and 'dawn' had been completed on normal difficulty.

I pressed 'resume campaign' anyway and sure enough it put me at the beginning of 'requiem' where he is asking her about a crash.

I thought this was pretty weird so i went i to system settings&gt;storage and deleted both saved files i had there and restarted the game.

That time it actually prompted me to 'start campaign' (that option wasnt even there the first time i started the game) ...but it still says that i have completed 'prologue' and 'requiem' on normal difficulty.

There isnt really anyone who could have played the game on my xbox that i know of.

This would make it so the people who frequently quit games are matched with others who frequently quit games. This gives them a taste of their own medicine and they will have to learn to stick through games in order to match with people who actually stay to the end.

It seems harsh but as long as you only leave 1 out of 5 games, there needs to be something that damages people for leaving their allies to die.

1355265753.0,14ouuj,Why people aren't good at Halo/how to get better.,Cleric187,11,8,25,"So

This led me back to the age old question of ""HOW do people become ""good"" at Halo?""

Well here is what I have seen in regards to why people are NOT good at halo.  

1.  You're just born that way.  
-It's true
2.  You make bad decesions.
-the majority of halo combat revolves around decesions.  ""Should I fight this guy even though he already has a shot on me"", ""should I stay in an open or closed area"", ""should I guard base or capture the objective"", ""should I stay near my team or go lone wolf"" ""should I hijack that mech, like a boss"", ""I'm gonna be a hero with 3 kills left.."", ETC...

Now
""should I fight this guy even though he already has a shot on me""
-No

""Should I charge right now?""
- If your K/d is under 1.25

""Should I reload or switch to secondary?""
-When in the heat of battle

""Should I stay in an open or closed area?""
-closed area's are generally easier for lesser skilled people to get kills or assists.  Why?  Because you can spaz out on someone in a small room by throwing grenades everywhere while ARing them.  This works to get kills.  So

""Should I guard base or capture the objective?""
-you will guard the base if you know what's good for your score and your teams chances of winning.  It's so easy to be succesful at defending the objective in H4.  Get active camo and an AR, commendations, and awards.  But, if it's KOTH...then run to the hill 24/7 with a hologram.

""Should I stay near my team or go lonewolf?""
-yes

""should I hijack that Mech
-NO! You will just end up getting killed like the 3 other times you already tried this game!  Spawn with a plasma pistol and EMP that mother so someone else can...You even get a special medal for doing so.

""I'm gonna be a hero with 2 kills left...""
-No, it can be really good.  Like 8-5-10, or 6-7-7.  You're still going positive when you consider assists, and that's a wonderful thing!

 3. You try to be everything.
-Don't.  Only be 1 thing.  Have a set plan as to what you want to accomplish on the map

Map: Observatory [Ver x.x]

Canvas: Impact

Version at post: 1.8


Players: FFA 6-8+, possible but untested)

Gametypes: FFA/Team Slayer
(Download tailored gametypes from my fileshare) 


Notable features:
- Asymmetric (not your cut and dry MLG map) 
- Single level with multiple slopes
- Extensive use of cover
- Balanced travel times to heavy combat areas/ordnance drops
- Teleporter (holds true to balanced travel times)
- Wreckage zones with hazards
- Center room with ladder mechanic
- Ascetic docking/circling space crafts
- Fantastic flow with easily distinguishable features (again


Design: 
This stellar observatory has suffered heavy meteor damage. Some causeways are exposed to the hazardous radiation of space, a teleporter prompts perpendicular travel to low ""heat"" zones on the edges of the station. The teleporter not only serves to put traffic in all zones on the map, it is also an added escape route if you suddenly become overwhelmed, especially in objective game types. During playtesting, most of the ""heat"" has been located in the center and near the teleporters, which means it doesn't take half the game to find out where the fight is. The multiple approaches to the central room make for fantastic flanking and rewards well-organized teams.

1354902750.0,14gcby,Best Longbow Dominion Strategy,Cleric187,4,1,6,"When playing Dominion, decreasing the advantage of individual skill for the opposing team.  

So, if not all, to B.  This is not what you should do, unless you are a team of elite slayers. Instead, you should focus on countering this universal strategy.

The best way to do this would be to send 3 people in the hog to A base, and the other 3 are responsible for holding C.  We are basically going to give B up.  So, let's discuss how to best execute this strategy.

HOG TEAM:
The hog team should rush the enemy's base (A Base).  Their goal is to clear the enemy base, mobility, and ammo (for extra rockets).  The other 2 guys in the hog should have loadouts designed to capture and hold the base, such as active camo, the grenadier perk (to bombard the base with nades before entering), and possibly the wetwork or dexterity perk as the support upgrade. 

When the hog rushes A base, and rocket the enemy inside as they try to capture the base.  At about this time, the gunner and driver should have exited the vehice and started to throw nades inside the base.  The gunner should go in through the side door near the rock structure in the middle, and the driver should go through the back door.  You should be able to take the base with ease due to the surprise of the rush, the firepower of rockets, and a combined 8 grenades.

Once the Hog team has secured A base, the base will be incredibly difficult to take back.  Especially if you still have rockets....and if you are halfway decent, YOU SHOULD.  Another suggestion in holding the base would be the firepower perk with a suppressor for close range action.  Suppressor &gt; DMR at close range, so use that to your advantage.

B man: (guy who rushes B)

One person should rush B base in the beggining in order to apply pressure to the enemy team and stall them while the rest of the team captures A and C.  The B man should be the teams 2nd best slayer.  His job is to delay the enemy occupation of B.  The recomended loadout would be DMR, Mobility, dexterity.  He should use mobility to get to B pronto, and then either the jetpack to gain the highground on the roof, or go inside the base before the enemy get there to camp with the boltshot.  The ideal scenario would be for the B man to get a few kills and hold the enemy off of B until the cap on A base is initiated.  Once B man dies, he then switches his loadout to hardlight shield, shielding

C Team:

C team has the easy task of capping the closest base and camping it until the end...  Seems boring, one guy should grab snipe, and one guy should initiate C base ASAP (in order to get the reinforcement weapon drop quicker).  The sniper should get to the top of C base where he can somewhat assist B man, and also help defend C if need be.  For camping C, the loadouts should be the same as described for camping A base (suppreser, active camo, hardligh shield, grenadier

Midway through the game, secured by shield doors and turrets, with close range power weapons, and with up to 3 teammates.... this is a situation that is heavily in your favor and puts you at a big advantage over most players, and a decent advantage over players that may be more ""skilled"" than you.

Important considerations:

It would be benificial for 1 guy camping A base to grab the Wraith when it's available.  
Patience and percesion are key to winning this map/gametype consistently.
Make sure to call out kills.  If A base gets a good double kill, just to keep the enemy on their toes...

1368819702.0,1ejbfb,A few things that makes it impossible for me to enjoy the multiplayer as a Halo game,MrTra1tor,17,13,11,"* **Loadout system:**

I hate this feature because it's far from what Halo is about! Halo had a special thing compared to other FPS and that feature was Weapons around the map! Sure we can get ordnance drops (Aka killstreaks) and sure there is a few power weapons on some maps. But that's not what I mean! I mean that everyone starts with the same kit and have to pick up a weapon that is somewhere on the map!

* **Matchmaking:**

It's good that they improved it so you can get in a match pretty fast even if it's low player count you can get into a game with people in the middle of the game! The really bad thing with this is that this causes people from different places around the world to come in the same game as you! For example: I'm Swedish so if an American would join me he would have over 300 ping! And if an Australian would join he would have mostly 900 ping! This leads me to...

* **Netcode:**

The netcode in Halo 4 is terrible! Especialy when a high-pinger comes to the same game as you! This means that even if you take cover from him

* **Theater:**

I know that it's only in 3 Halo game (only counting the multiplayer) but this feature is so buggy that it's almost impossible sometimes to record! [Example video here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGmtUtNYKxE)

I want the old Halo 3 theater back!

* **Hackers:**

Halo 4 is super easy to hack (much easier than Halo 3 was!) and this is really a huge problem! I've seen people firing a shotgun and killing me through the entire map! I've also seen alot people who apperantly have unlimited armor abilities an rapid rocket launchers! It's really annoying that 343 did not include an anti hack service for the game!

* **Vehicle design:**

[SPOILER ALERT]

This may be content from the campaign but it's still bugs me.

The redesigned version of the Pelican is horrible! It's far from what a Pelican should look! When I played the level where you could actually fly one (Reclaimer?) it didn't feel like I was flying a pelican! It felt like I was flying a reskinned version of the Falcon! The old Pelican version looked awesome and there is no good reason to change the design!

The friends I played with constantly over the first few weeks have all scattered and the random players I've been finding are...  Abominations.  It would be bad enough if they just sucked.  But the rampant team killing on Ragnarok

It's been keeping me away from it.  So I'm looking to find some new friends.  I play objective games

I miss the shit outa the Falcon and got some of my greatest enjoyment out of Halo 4 before they removed the Banshee from CTF Ragnarok.
