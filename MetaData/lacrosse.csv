This is the email:
""Would one of you be able to teach our lacrosse 101 at 5:30 pm this Friday. It will last for about an hour and cover the rules and other basics of the game.  The audience will mostly consist of parents.  Let me know asap if you can do this.  If more than one of you can do this

PLEASE UPVOTE THIS FOR VISIBILITY. I GET NO KARMA FOR THIS BUT I REALLY NEED HELP! Thanks for anything and everything!

EDIT: I'd like to emphasize that this is mostly for the parents but new kids will probably show up too

1369011950.0,1enyvb,"To answer almost every post on this subreddit ""How do I faceoff?"" Well. Here it is.",Yoaty,36,4,9,"Face-Off Tutorial #1

&gt;Stance/Set-up:

The correct stance is one of the most important aspects of the face-off. There are many ways you can set up for a face-off

1. Don't put any weight on your hands when setting up

2. Set your hands on your stick the same way for every face off; this way you are practicing proper technique

3. Line up as close to the ball as you can

&gt;Reading a Player:

No matter if this player is the best or the worst face-off player in the world he is readable. Some are better at hiding what they are going to do, and their wrist position. The left wrist position tells a lot about what move he will do. For instance:

1.If the players left wrist is off the ground he will most likely jump the ball or punch it.
2.If the players left wrist is resting on the ground he will usually clamp.


&gt;Countering:

Being able to counter your opponent’s move is also important for being a good face-off middie. The clamp is one of the most popular moves for the face-off but is also the easiest to counter-act. To counter act the Clamp* you use the jump*. To counter act a move such as the jump you would do something I call the punch*. When setting up for the punch put a little bit of pressure on your right hand
*Refer to the moves section of the post for an explanation of these moves

&gt;Stick Type/What you look for in a face off head:

Offset or not:
Although many of the sticks made now days are offset

Flexibility:
Most players who do face-offs prefer stiff heads. They have stiff heads because they don't want their heads to bend due to the other player pushing on them with their stick and all the other contact involved in a face-off.

Flexible sticks can help in getting the ball out of your opponents stick because it can pinch it self temporarily around the ball. More flexible heads can also be used for moves such as the plunger. The only thing to worry about flexible heads it that they sometimes don't flex back all the right after the face-off do to the pressure you put on it. So if you use more force in your moves go with a stiff head.

&gt;Basic Moves

Clamp:
This is probably the most common and simplest move in the game today. It goes like this. Basically

Jump:
The jump is sometimes called a reverse clamp due to the fact that you still trap the ball with your head, so it is a slight bit complicated. You use your right hand to pick your head up off the ground, while tilting the top back towards yourself and pushing it forward at he same time. You then bring it back down once you get over the ball, so as to trap the ball. Once again, you can either rake it or pop back to yourself. If you did the move correctly, your stick should be underneath your opponent’s, as this move is used to beat the clamp.

Punch:
Also called a push, while pushing the head forward at the same time. This will hopefully push the ball forward, so it ends up behind your opponent. It works best against a jump, but can also work well against a clamp.

Plunger:
This is a really fun move if you can actually pull it off in a game. It goes like this. When the whistle blows, as some refs may call you for it seeing as it is technically stuck in the back of your head, but the rule is kinda shady on all this, and if you get it down fast enough, most refs won’t have enough time to see that it is stuck in your head.

Two Finger:
Ah, as it WILL be called EVERY time if the ref ends up seeing it, and there have been cases of people breaking their fingers from this move. Here’s how it goes. If you know your opponent is gonna clamp, you take you index and middle fingers on your right hand and flip them out, so as to catch his mesh as he clamps down. You then lift up his stick and either rake it or kick it out. This move should only be used but two or three times a game since your opponent will pick up on it pretty quick if you keep using it. And, you must remember to hide your hands from the ref with your body so he can’t actually see what you are doing.

Tips:
-Your three main moves are like a game of “rock, beats a push, which beats a jump, which beats a clamp. So, reading his hands and anticipating his move is an important tool in facing off.
-When clamping, it helps to push your left hand forward. This will help you get your stick under his. If he does beat you in the clamp, try to get your right foot in the path of where he will rake the ball. This will buy you some more time and possibly give you a second chance at the ball if he is dumb enough to flick it into your foot.
-It’s always fun to mess with your opponent before you go down to face… tell him how much your jock itches
-After the ref calls set, or make some kind of noise, to see if the guy I’m going against has ADD and will jump early at any noise… once again, kinda cheap, but it works sometimes.

Look at his sweatshirt in the second photo.

I looked around for him on google and couldn't find anything saying that he played lacrosse. I checked UNH's [roster](http://mcla.us/teams/new_hampshire/2011/roster.html) and he wasn't there. Anyone have any additional info on this? Maybe he was on the team at one point or he got cut?

Edit: http://www.tnhonline.com/mobile/america-s-freshman-1.2789055

My college club team has some very serious practice attendance issues. We're a small team, even though we can and have had practices with upwards of 16, 17 guys. Nobody cares, and always has an excuse not to come. I want to play. I hit the wall. I show up every day. I love this game too much to let others ruin it. But I can't progress if nobody shows, especially as a pole. 

I've thought about playing at other schools, my questions are:

-Does anyone else have to deal with this sort of thing on a regular basis?

-If so

-Is there anything I can do to help my president/player coach to get people to come other than flyers and talking to the players to get them to come (which has been done numerous times)?

Sorry this has been so long, and don't know what to do.

During my time there we went from JV2 to JV (in Oregon), they were pushed up to D1 Varsity. They have continued the 7th/8th team, continued the JV and JV2 team for high school, and they have added a 5th/6th team. The club is getting kids started at a very young age now. The program has grown from 20 kids with rented equipment to a few hundred with a brand new field. 

This year a new team was added to a local high school. They are currently D2 Varsity. They played their very first game and won handily. The sport is growing and I don't doubt that there will be more teams added in the next 5 years to this area.

As demanded by our coach we all showed good sportsmanship even when we were frustrated and made mistakes/committed penalties. 

The Duluth coach however was the most unsportsmanlike

He:

1.  Yelled at our players on the sideline that were trying to communicate with our players on the field
2. Yelled at our managers (volunteers) when they had a minor mistake at the table (Wrong number for a ground ball).
3. Was constantly yelling at the refs who were trying there best (lax hasn't been in GA very long so they had no opportunity to play themselves). 
4. Didn't make his team have a ""RaaRaa"" cheer at the end of the game. (This is standard
5. (This is where it gets ridiculous) Refused to shake any of the players
6. When our coach started getting upset (understandable at this point) this coach said said ""sportsmanship is a joke"" and proceeded to spout out curse words and racial slurs at our team. (Our school is predominantly black but the team in predominately white

This is just ridiculous to me. I was so duimbfounded when he refused to shake my hand that I didn't have the logic to react. 

I'm more than upset by this behavior as it sheds a negative light on our sport that is shining pillar of great sportsmanship. 

The saddest part about the whole thing to me is that the players were in no way respectful too. They had modeled their behavior after their coach. Is depressing to think that these students are being lead by someone of this character. This team has the opportunity to be a good team in a rising cultural group in the south but when people with these ethics and morals are involved t sickens me. 

I'm sorry if this has no place here I just needed to rant about the most ridiculous and depressing thing I've ever seen in many years enjoying this great sport. Thanks for being and audience.


**TL;DR**: The coach of the team that we played was completely disrespectful, and the volunteers that were running the table. At the end of the game they didn't perform a ""RaaRaa"" cheer and the coach refused to shake our hand in the line after the game. When our coach got onto him out of anger he proceeded to say ""Sportsmanship is a joke"" and called our team many curse words and racial slurs. It just disappoints me that people would act like this in our great sport.

I'm 14 years old and female. I was diagnosed with it in 6th grade. My cardiologist told me I couldn't do any sports except for jogging and swimming. I hate swimming

I heard a few of my guy friends talking about lacrosse and how much fun it is and I decided that I wanted to check it out. I watched a few videos on YouTube and it seems like a lot of fun. It's mostly running and throwing, which I will be asking him about it, but for now I wanted to get you guys' opinions.

I was a big basketball player in the past, etc.) and I didn't really have these problems with softball or soccer, just basketball. I'm guessing it was like this because of all the jerking around and quick direction changes that you make in softball. Keep in mind, I played all these sports before I was diagnosed and on medication.

My mom is concerned for a lot of reasons. #1 would be the heart issues, so there's nothing I can do about that.

I'm concerned because of the joint issues. I felt like I had arthritis at 12 years old back when I played basketball. I don't want that to happen again, like there is in basketball?

I really really want to do lacrosse. Ever since I've been diagnosed, and go on the internet. I'm not fat, because I don't know why, but I'm not. I just want to get out of this habit, and start getting fit and motivated again. I remember how much fun sports were for me, and I really want to be able to do them again.

I can't really make a TL;DR for this because every detail counts

So I started playing lacrosse in the 7th grade, in all due respect, a joke. I didnt really pick it up until 8th grade, and i played attack then. I knew i was going to switch schools, and that the school i now currently attend was reputed to be among the top 50 in the nation. So i traded my shortie into a pole, and practiced all throughout the summer, and happily enough, i made the team.


I was surprised, made the team. (But i still am far from the best)


The team went 13-2 this year, and Baltimore teams. And we won our championship. I didnt play in the championship game, but frankly, i dont really care.
