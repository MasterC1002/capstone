1) bolt the thing on just tight enough to not move when you aren't touching it (preferably this step is done with the chain off

2) Now move there derailleur up till it has 1-2MM of clearance from top of the teeth on the big ring (I use my fingernail as a gauge) 

3) looking at it from above get the outer plate of the derailleur as perfectly parallel to the middle (with a triple) or big (with a double) chain ring as you can

4) tighten up the derailleur 

If your chain isn't on yet put it on

5) put the rear derailleur into the biggest cog in back and turn the low limit in or out until the inner plate is 2MM off the chain. 

6) drop the rear derailleur into the small cog and bring the front up to the big ring (I usually loosely attach the cable and tug on that to get the derailleur to move over) then set the high limit till you have a MM or so between the outer plate and the chain

7) tighten the cable and give it a few tugs to get the housing to seat

1347432960.0,zr7jm,"A Short Comparison of the Three Editions of ""Zinn &amp; The Art of Road Bike Maintenance"" — For Frugal Shoppers…",talkingwires,21,1,3,"I bought my first new road bike nine months ago, and came to the conclusion that [*Zinn &amp; The Art of Road Bike Maintenance*](http://www.amazon.com/Zinn-Art-Road-Bike-Maintenance/dp/1934030422/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=134742934) was the best bet for explaining stuff to newbies with more than enough advanced information to build a bike from the frame up

Why's is this book so great? Brief review: He has two books, unlike some of the other recommended books. Each repair is categorized on a three-tiered system based on what tools you need, which I'll paraphrase as ""Essentials You Need to Own a Bike and Should Probably Carry With You on Longer Trips"", ""Hobbyists That Want to be Self-Reliant"", and ""You Could Open Your Own Repair Shop"". And, if you just want the basics, there's a chapter dedicated to maintenance you can do with the most basic of tools

(TIL from *Zinn* - If you don't have an extra tube or patch, you can stuff the tire with grass and other padding to limp home without damaging the wheel.)

One criticism: No disc brakes coverage. At all.

*****

So, and was confronted with three different editions, published in 2000, 2005, and 2009. The earlier ones were used, the latest was only available new, and there was a twenty dollar difference between the three. Which to buy? I had some time to kill, so I'll try to keep it brief:

All three are solid tomes of bicycle knowledge, spending more time with parts like threaded stems and outdated braking systems than is really necessary. The second edition still includes the original information, but shifts the newer stuff (which has become the standard) ahead of the older stuff. Many more illustrations are included, and tips from other mechanics have been inserted in sidebars throughout the book or integrated into the text.

The jump from the second to the third edition is much more subtle, with no more awkward white space between words in paragraphs. The layout of the pages has also been redesigned, using new fonts, a second color, and white space to make everything much more slick. Unfortunately, that means much of the increased page count comes from the fact that there's less text on a page. There's even some regressions, like losing the chapter title printed on the side of each page so you can quickly thumb through the book to find the section you need.

As for new content in the third edition, such as the ones about self-sealing tubes and tubeless tires (he mentions other brands besides Slime, now). I even noticed one correction about using citrus-based solvents (they contain water and shouldn't be used for soaking a chain).

It was so bad, Motoex did nothing). They still had my bike and were trying to figure out what to do next.

 So I get a call yesterday: turns out the SRAM rep had stopped into the shop so they showed him my bike. He replaced my entire system (front and rear) withe the new X0 trail brake. New four piston design, the whole shebang. Installed and adjusted by a factory guy for free. Still in shock here. Plus he gave me the entire old system back too. Just stunned by the level of service I received. I have nothing but the highest praise for Avid now.

Today I flipped the bike upside down with the seat post out and loads of this weird material came out (see pics). It's a black plastic type material that looks to be weaved like carbon. My frame however is aluminium (Planet X Superlight). The larger parts seemed to match the curve of the frame.

Quite a lot came out and every time I righted the bike and flipped it again more came out. 

There were lots of smaller shards of this stuff near the top of the seat stay on the inside.

Did one of the front a while back and had a request to do the rear

This works better starting with the chain off

1) Bolt on the derailleur 

2) Looking at the derailleur from above and behind the cassette set the high limit till the top and bottom jockey wheel lines up perfectly (this is where it helps to have the chain off) 

3) push the derailleur all the way over to the easiest gear and push it all the way against the stop. Again line up the jockey wheels with the big cog. 

4) put the chain on (put it in big big and make sure it has a bit of slack) 

5) put the bike in the small chain ring and again push the derailleur over to the small cog 

6) now take the B tension screw (the one that pushes against the hanger and rocks the derailleur back) till you have a full link between the jockey wheel and cassette. Note! At this point your derailleur is adjusted if your having shifting issues it is all cable tension

 7) hook up the cable (shimano and campy derailleurs like to be taught

 8) at this point start shifting up and down

The way we operate is to walk the customer through the repairs, in hopes that they'll gain some insight into the requirements of bike maintenance and be better bike owners. This dude comes in with an aluminum schwinn something or other from Kmart (he told me where he bought it) with a click in the bottom bracket. I examined the bb and couldn't see anything obviously wrong, except that the lockring on the adjustable cup was loose, but the cup wasn't loose or tight, so I guessed bad pitting or broken bearings and set to work pulling it apart for a rebuild.

I pulled the driveside crank myself, getting as much purchase as we could on the remaining threads, but the crank was seized and going nowhere, probably severely overly torqued by the mechanic at Kmart, as many of those bikes are.

Stuck in a hard place (and not having one of [these](http://i2.photobucket.com/albums/y21/dissident75/Misc%20Bike%20Parts/crank_puller.jpg) in the shop, being extremely careful not to touch the frame. No luck. Finally I found I was able to get a pair of long needle nose on the cup threads and with a lot of crunching of the cup, I unthreaded it and pulled the crank out with the bb spindle still attached.

I spent the next 30 minutes digging through parts bins to find a matching bb and useable crankset and as I installed them he asked what this was going to cost. I told him we charged $10/hr for the shop time and with the components, and all the extra time was my fault (even though the crank puller was in his hand when the problem started.) I told him he was being unreasonable, that like it or not, Kmart bikes are not designed to be repaired and we do our best, but frankly that's just the nature of the game when you shop at department stores. He refused to pay any more than $10, so I pulled his bike out of the stand and kicked him out. He came back 10 minutes later and said that I hadn't finished the job because the new cranks didn't line up with the front derailleur. I told him that we don't do work for free and when he refused to pay, he forfeited his right to service. He made a scene in front of the shop for five minutes and finally left.

What would others have done? I probably shouldn't have let him use the crank puller, but like I said, it was a tough situation.

I can't see anything inside the caliper that'd be causing a problem (granted it's hard to get a good look).

I wanted to get this up in case anyone has immediate thoughts.  If necessary I can try to get a picture up later this evening.

I'm hoping maybe someone has BB5 experience on this sort of a problem.

I drew red lines through the grips on the pads so you can see the angle problem.
I worked at it some more, I'll be taking it to the bike shop to get them to investigate, correct and hopefully tell me how to fix it in the future if I come across it again.

On a plus note

FOLLOWUP: In case anyone is still reading ;)  I took it to the bike shop. It's still a bit wonky but they seemed to have tuned the tension and such better than I.  Ultimately they said they've seen this in bb5s and it seems the pads often don't like to sit the way they're supposed to due to the design.

I have zero experience with this sort of thing. I want to do it myself as I can save on labour and pick up a skill at the same time. Also having a project keeps the winter blues away.

My googlefu is lacking. [This](http://www.carectomy.com/buy-used-road-bike/) website gave me some general tips, and any other knowledge that you can only get from people who have done it themselves.

1370148230.0,1fi5yx,Small question about how the chain should be routed through the derailleur pulleys.,cooper12,13,1,18,"Hey everyone. I got a new chain today at my LBS

Now

What I mean by pulleys: http://i.imgur.com/ffgSaML.png

How it looked before: http://i.imgur.com/T5j2wwI.png

How it looks now: http://i.imgur.com/GXmzplN.png

My main guess for why the mechanic decided to put the chain through this way is that the chain he had wasn't long enough or he was trying to be cheap and save some links. I tried researching the purpose of the pulleys and the most I really got was that they: 

&gt; regulate the tension of the chain as it runs over different sized sprockets
 
So if I read correctly

**My Question/TL;DR**: Is it normal for a chain to be routed through the pulleys the way it currently is on my bike? Am I at a disadvantage in respect to shifting gears or drivetrain efficiency? 

**Edit:** So, its different seeing your bike in a higher gear. When I got it back my bike was shifted higher and later on my friend shifted it to the largest sprocket for me so the pulleys were nearly horizontal. At the time I thought the way it was, was wrong. I really should've double checked before posting. I'll be more careful in the future in self-diagnosing problems and jumping to blame the mechanic. Thanks a lot for your help guys! :)

7. Trued the spokes so that the wheels don't move so much.

About 2 months later the side to side play increased so much that I thought my cleats were loose. I had the head mechanic check it out but strangely

Heres an image of the exact model: http://media.performancebike.com/images/performance/products/1500/50-7925-GSL-ANGLE.jpg

The dust caps if you can't tell have a flat head socket and are made of plastic.
I bought the newer model(as far as I can tell the only difference is the spring is silver) and strangely

I found ones that I could remove without damage

I took it apart and what I found was a very simple assembly. There is a single cartridge bearing on the end, upon which the spindle tapers out, and the other side operates as a greased sleeve bearing. And thats it.

Apparently, thus binding the plastic.

So to me this seems kind of stupid

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hello there. So I blew a seal (heh) and thought I'd try my hand at servicing my fork myself. I already had the 3 special tools for this job (slider protector, so I ordered Marzocchi 7.5 wt oil and an oil &amp; dust seal kit. I downloaded instructions from enduroforkseals.com and went to work.

Everything looked good &amp; aside from one blown seal theree were no cracked or corroded o-rings, and followed the reassembly directions.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Problem 1: far from being able to simply ""press"" in the replacement oil seal, so the upper washer was free to rattle around between the bottom of the oil seal and the top of the pilot bushing. 

* Problem 2: after filling the stanchion with the recommended amount of oil (leaving 30mm of headroom) and pressurizing to 2.5 BAR

* Problem 3: figuring I has mis-measured the amount of oil I put in

* Problem 4: I now have something like 60mm of headroom and am barely getting 1.75 inches of travel when I really, but it's just crazy stiff.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

So what did I do wrong? Is the problem that I left 3mm of rattling space between the oil seal and upper washer? Should I get a bigger hammer and try again? Maybe the replacement seals were a little swollen?

Your ideas are greatly appreciated.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Update: I figured it out (but only after disassembly and reassembly to get that oil seal fully seated). The problem is that the manual does not specify whether the fork should be filled with oil with the fork fully extended or fully compressed. I had assumed I should fill it fully extended, I concluded that you are supposed to leave 30mm of headroom when the fork is fully compressed.

So I did just that

There is very little dampening after the rebuild, I can get 3/4 travel just dropping off of a curb. Adjusting the rebound does have an effect, but it's hard to tell with little compression dampening.

I'm 99% certain I got all the shims/springs etc back together in the ~~right~~ orginal order. It doesn't match any of the photos of cartridges on the fox site so I can't verify. Does anyone know where I can find an exploded diagram so I can ensure it's right?

Well, so I proceeded to disassemble the brake calipers and unscrew the whole assembly from the front. It seemed like it was awfully tight, but I didn't know any better. It turned out that there was a tiny alan screw on the underside, locking the bolt in place, and my powerful unscrewing had rethreaded the center bolt through the whole brake assembly. Oof. Now when I try to tighten it back together, it threads askew. Ruined.

I swung by my local bike shop hoping they'd have a spare bolt by chance. No dice. All they had was a bad attitude about my fuck up. I guess I deserve it

So here's the question! Is there *anywhere* I can find a replacement bolt for the front R365 by Tektro? If so, should I consider any other brake systems if I'm gonna end up replacing it outright anyway?

I will try to provide as much information as possible and the ideas I have been mulling over.

My bike is a 48cm Specialized Dolce Sport from last year. I bought the bike secondhand in June of this year, front tire tube, both tires are all stock. Rear tube is of course not stock as it keeps getting flats. 

I live in NYC and as such there's always glass everywhere or sharp little gravel rocks from the DOT resurfacing roads. The type of riding that I do is commuting throughout the week and then on the weekends I enter ""tours"" or go on 30+ rides with my friends. Sometimes I travel during the weekend to visit family and go on long rides. I would consider myself someone who prefers riding longer distances than just for commuting. I always try to ride on nicely paved roads but sometimes gravel/chips are unavoidable. I push myself when I ride but don't usually try to race unless I have entered a ride that I paid for. I try my best to avoid hazards but it doesn't always work.

My LBS told me to inflate my tires to 115 psi for the type of rides I go on, S6000 622x15.""

The flats I get are from debris punctures. My most recent flat was causes by what looked like, but they are just so buttery and pick up tons of stuff.

I want to do longer and longer rides. I want to be able to do a ride bike/ camp along the way combo trip without having to take like 6 spare tubes with me. I did a century ride this past weekend and my flat tire really screwed me up.

A friend of mine works for REI and has installed Latex stand ins on his mountain bike and he raves about them. I've seen mixed reviews about them on Reddit. Probably the best advice I've seen on Reddit was to just eat the cost of new rims and tires for the tubeless road bike tires. I don't know how much that'll run me though.

So I've been researching Conti Gaterskins and Conti Gator hardshells and the Conti GP4000S. There are so many tires though

One thing for sure I know to steer clear of from what I've seen are the Slimer tubes.

I guess at this point I'm trying to decide whether to A.) just replace tires, or C.) go tubeless.

I have another big ride in two weeks

Thank you for any help you can provide.

EDIT: I talked to my LBS owner today (not the guy who told me patches are worthless, I have 700-25c on my bike currently. Bike dude also said for me to come in once a week for him to show me his way of very quickly changing a flat, so I have flat class with my bike mechanic it would seem.

Last time out, this has happened a couple of times before) I flipped the bike over, guided the chain back into the crank, and all was well.

My gut says it's either a problem with the chain or one of the derailleurs, but I wasn't able to spot anything with obvious. The chain looks to be in good shape, and the rear derailleur's tension and jockey pulleys appear to be in line. Googling the issue in every combination of words I could think of yielded only suggestions that it might be wear (this bike has probably been ridden ~20 times) and links to sheldon brown's site.

I bought a single-speed bike second hand a couple of weeks ago

I initially had a problem with the left (non-chain) crank side working loose while riding, so I bought a [new set of cranks on eBay](http://r.ebay.com/y15vSK). Admittedly, these cranks were crazy cheap, and when they arrived, I inspected the square-taper fitting and observed that it looked pretty shoddy - not the ""perfect square"" I would have liked to have seen.

Anyway, and then exactly the same problem again - left-side crank coming loose mid-ride. I've been re-tightening when convenient, but given that the cranks were cheap and bad, and I wanted a different-sized chainring on the front anyway, I've shelled out a bit extra for some [decent branded cranks](http://r.ebay.com/npRCLR).

When I got home I had a chance to properly look at things and noticed that the sound was actually the chain rubbing against cage in both the high and low ring.

The rear derailleur was also shifting poorly (hanging in certain gears) though this is something I can fix myself by just using the barrel adjuster.

I ran a few flats two weeks ago on my back wheel.  Three years with this setup, new tubes, and kept going.

Ran another flat last week, in some places its a little off centre.  It's not really a tape so I can't really push it back to the exact of the inside of the rim but I put some rubber tape on places where it might be an issue, seemed to take care of the hard edges.

The tires I really really checked, but nothing sharp and no rips aside from a little tiny one that I patched up.  Another new tube and kept going.

Another flat yesterday.  So I checked all my tubes that have gone flat lately recently. All the holes seem to be on the tire side (outside) but in different spot relative to the valve. So I'm thinking tire issue right?  Figure I'd put in a new tube and buy a new tire today during lunch - crossing fingers that I don't run another flat in that small window.

* cranks: Tiagra/Apex
* Front Derailleur - would anyting work? Should I just choose something cheap (sora/acera)?

I may give it another shot, but I doubt I'll have much luck.

Unfortunately I didn't think to get a pic while working on it earlier. But to make it clear what type of thing we're dealing with

When I pulled the brake, I could brake properly, but the rear wheel would be stuck, so then I'd have to ride for a second or two before the brakes were unstuck so I could ride properly. 

I tried taking a wrench to the rear brakes, when I ride the brake cables jump, and my seat shakes.

1371507987.0,1gjo3f,Chain Jumping?,Tommy_Taylor_Lives,8,1,5,"Hey Bike Wrench

So I'm riding a 1987 schwinn World Sport(Tour?). Anyways awhile ago I needed to change out my crankset and seeing as it would be all new teeth, is really wide. So wide that the new crankset isn't close enough for the front derailer to be of use any more(I'm not too concerned as I RARELY use that other gear anyways). But then this new problem has come up. 

If I have the chain on the smallest ring in the back, it doesn't do it. So this is only happening when there's real wieght behind the push. It could be jumping or something else. I just know that while riding it's a little crazy having something happen like two or three times in a full pedal rotation.

I went to the obvious answer that I need to adjust the limit screws and it'll be all set.

Nothing. Fucked with both the screws(incase I was adjusting the wrong one) and it didn't help.

If I put the chain on the ring next to it, or having all my energy used. 

I had a rack on and thought that the screw might be the cause. But I took that off last week and still have the problem. 

Any ideas?

I put my bike on the stand today for some cleaning and noticed that my rear tire has a slight bulge. The tire/tube has ~600mi on them and the wheel was recently trued. It is still true and I can't find any defects in the rim wall. The rim is also mostly dish and the tension is good. I've removed and re-seated the tube and tire and it's still there. I've checked the rim tape and its good/straight and the bead is in good condition. 

The problem only shows up &gt;80psi so I'm leaning towards the tire. I have yet to try swapping tubes. Google says it might be damage/defect in the tire. 

Any ideas?

Also it may be related to the distance between the lowest part of the derailleur and the big chainring as it is about 4.5mm.

Update 2:  [Edit:I THOUGHT] Problem was fixed with a quick derailleur calibration.  *facepalm*
I'm still considering moving the whole derailleur down by about 2mm just to optimize the shifting.

Thanks everyone for contributing your insights.  Upvotes for everyone!

Update 3: Test ride resulted in a some successful riding with shifting

The front derailleur cable is not installed properly- with bends that are much, unlikely, as they aren't really so badly worn.  The chain might be too worn.  The chain might be the wrong size.  I will ask the bike owner if they've ever changed the chain.  They didn't mention it the last time I asked if they'd ever replaced any parts, thou.  The chain might be too long.

The most popular theory at the bike co-op was that replacing the front derailleur cable with a new one, that the chainrings may have been bent farther apart from the chain jamming in between them, and they may need to be bent back in using pliers, or by separating the chainring and banging it straight.  One guy told me he'd never seen this happen before.  No one really knows what's causing it.  So I'm asking you all.",,False,,1341971317.0,t3_w7dae
