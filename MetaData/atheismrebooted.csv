1372186651.0,1h1zoh,A Complete Summary of Recent /r/atheism Events,IRBMe,658,206,351,"###Part 1

1. /u/skeen originally created /r/atheism about 5 years ago. His [policy](http://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/y0spz/a_reminder_the_philosophy_of_ratheism/) was to essentially let the subreddit run itself without any interference.
2. /r/atheism eventually grew to be a default subreddit
3. /u/tuber later added another mod
4. Recently
5. /u/jij then [submitted a request](http://www.reddit.com/r/redditrequest/comments/1f7oeq/request_removal_of_skeen_from_ratheism_moderators/) to /r/redditrequest and because /u/skeen hadn't logged into his account recently
6. Almost immediately after that happened, it was a change that went against /u/skeen's original policy.
7. There was a large revolt against /u/jij by many people who were unhappy with the changes or who were unhappy with the way he had seemingly usurped control of the subreddit to make them.
8. /u/skeen logged back into his account and made it clear that he [wanted the subreddit back](http://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/1fs930/lets_make_ratheism_free_and_open_again/). He claimed that he was active but browsed reddit with a different account.
9. The subreddit became divided between those who were against the changes and the removal of /u/skeen and those who liked the changes and agreed with /u/jij.
10. Many of the circlejerk and anti-/r/atheism subreddits got involved
11. In order to try to placate some of the users, the preliminary results of which [can be found here](http://atheism.xp3.biz/statistics.php).
12. /u/jij created a page on /r/atheism explaining [why he requested skeen](http://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/1g3mb8/full_disclosure_of_skeens_removal/) to be removed and why he made the changes he did

###Part 2

13. Meanwhile, both well known for their anti-/r/atheism stances, as well as various meta-reddits and circlejerk subreddits.
14. Suddenly all threads complaining about the changes or the moderators
15. /u/tuber created /r/AtheismPolicy for people to voice their concerns instead
16. /u/syncretic2, saying that it wasn't necessarily going to lead to any changes.
17. Several users have now unsubscribed from /r/atheism and are moving to [/r/atheismrebooted](/r/atheismrebooted) and various other satellite subreddits.
18. Many people continued down-voting new content in /r/atheism and posting content about censorship and freedom of speech as a form of protest
19. /u/tuber was made a mod of /r/circlejerk and posted a [thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/circlejerk/comments/1g6mnj/mission_accomplished/) there showing /r/atheism going up in flames. This caused a lot of outrage.
20. The new /r/atheism mods hid the downvote button in an attempt to stop new content from being down-voted.
21. New /r/atheism mod
22. [/r/atheismrebooted](/r/atheismrebooted) was temporarily taken over and defaced by [/r/circlejerk](/r/circlejerk). It has now returned to normal
23. /u/tuber posted [an official apology](http://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/1gauwa/an_apology_to_the_users_of_ratheism/) to /r/atheism
24. /r/atheism started adding some Knights of New (trusted members of the /r/atheism community) as mods. Some refused.

###Part 3

25. After speaking out against the new /r/atheism
26. A new [weekly feedback thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/1glum0/weekly_feedback_thread_1) was posted in /r/atheism. One of the biggest changes that was promised was new flair, in which comments are listed in a random order and replies are not shown by default. As with most of their other threads, the community feedback was generally very negative.
27. /u/TheFacebookGod removed himself (or was removed?) as a moderator and leaked a [screenshot](http://i.imgur.com/lSuhfH9.png?) of part of the /r/atheism mod-chat. He [vowed to release](http://www.reddit.com/r/askthelord/comments/1gnw3w/i_am_god_for_some_reason_i_was_made_a_moderator/) another image each day.
28. Despite mostly negative feedback from the feedback thread
29. /u/TheFacebookGod posted [a full album](http://www.reddit.com/r/askthelord/comments/1grlyt/ratheism_leaks_full_album/) of all of the leaked mod-chat screenshots
30. /u/TheFacebookGod also [offered to pay](http://i.imgur.com/C4PEcrD.jpg) for the top-mod position of /r/atheism
31. Meanwhile
32. /u/TheFacebookGod is [reported as a spammer](http://reddit.com/r/reportthespammers/comments/1gr58w/overview_for_thefacebookgod/) to /r/reportthespammers.
33. /r/AtheismPolicy is [made private](http://www.reddit.com/r/atheismrebooted/comments/1h09fk/ratheismpolicy_is_a_private_sub_now/).
34. /r/AtheismRebooted sponsors [ads](http://reddit.com/r/atheismrebooted/comments/1h19be/thanks_to_uwaotter_for_sponsoring_the/) on /r/atheism
35. [/r/atheism](/r/atheism) announces a new subreddit

Today

http://stattit.com/subreddits/by_submissions_avg_1d/

I'll save you some time digging

So what the fuck happened, that made NO mention of a poll in the title (which would have alerted more people that were against the change to take a look). 

The results (that I remember to the best of my knowledge) was something along the lines of 40% wanted to remove default posts

So what happened? Did they say ""well

What syncretic had to say about his reasoning why the change was made:

&gt;The majority who did care wanted to ban the defaults

http://i.imgur.com/z5aRCrO.png

I was pretty damn pissed. Not only was the poll not mentioned in the post title, fundamental changes to the subreddit I think more than 40% support is warranted. Syncretic and the other mods obviously disagreed. 

One user made this astute comment:

&gt;The issue that caused this to come about was the perceived reduction in quality by the old school bestof redditors.

&gt;The solution the moderators decided on was that was put in place was to create /r/defaultgems and make it opt-in for everyone to see default reddit posts. The problem here is that it calls for action by the people who did not have a problem in the first place

http://www.reddit.com/r/bestof/comments/zqx7m/announcement_its_time_for_another_poll_this_one/c66z4r8

I'm guessing people are starting to notice some parallels between what happened then and what is happening now. Specifically, and are now coming back with their warped vision of how to 'fix' things.

The second parallel evident here is how they chose to deal with dissenters. Instead of implementing real compromise (such as allowing default posts some times during the week)

There was a lot of blow back. A lot of people were very unhappy

(I suggest skimming through this thread at least. A good amount of our complaints and points of contention are very similar)

One thing I want to make very clear. No compromise was ever made. The mods conceded NOTHING. No ""default weekends"" (as was even suggested at the time by some of the mods in order to seem like they were taking our outrage into consideration). Nothing. They created /r/defaultgems

A few things I want to make clear and why I believe this is important and relevant to our situation now:

1) I know at least a couple of the mods involved in the /r/bestof change are now our mods

2) Unlike today

3) They proposed a lot of 'compromises' but never went through with them. Right now our mods are doing the same thing

4) The change did not permanently come into effect until about a month or so after they made the change. This is very important, moderators suggest waiting a month until the whole thing blows over is the best approach.

(Note: When I say 'permanently' I don't mean to say that the change was ever at any time reverted over the course of the month

5) Syncretic does not care about free speech. He doesn't care about what you want. The guy said so himself in the leaked mod posts. 

http://imgur.com/Rr6xZdS

Compare what syncretic said then to what he's saying now:

Bestof poll: http://i.imgur.com/z5aRCrO.png
Atheism poll: http://i.imgur.com/w4jZ6Bw.png

You notice how in the first image he uses the poll as justification for changes, the second one didn't. That's the critical division between the two.

I've been a reader of /r/atheism for many years.  And my memory is terrible.  Can anyone remember (or look up) how long it took for /r/atheism to grow?  Going off my terrible recollection I can vaguely recall when we had less then 5k readers there.  It took maybe a year or so to break the 10k mark, all due to being a default sub (again.)

I think hitting 5k in less than a month is a great start

So

10- You vigorously deny the existence of thousands of gods claimed by other religions

9- You feel insulted and ""dehumanized"" when scientists say that people evolved from lesser life forms

8- You laugh at polytheists

7- Your face turns purple when you hear of the ""atrocities"" attributed to Allah, and trees!

6- You laugh at Hindu beliefs that deify humans, who then gave birth to a man-god who got killed, came back to life and then ascended into the sky.

5- You are willing to spend your life looking for little loop-holes in the scientifically established age of the Earth (4.55 billion years)

4- You believe that the entire population of this planet with the exception of those who share your beliefs -- though excluding those in all rival sects -- will spend Eternity in an infinite Hell of Suffering. And yet you consider your religion the most ""tolerant"" and ""loving"".

3- While modern science, biology, and physics have failed to convince you otherwise, some idiot rolling around on the floor speaking in ""tongues"" may be all the evidence you need to prove Christianity.

2- You define 0.01% as a ""high success rate"" when it comes to answered prayers. You consider that to be evidence that prayer works. And you think that the remaining 99.99% FAILURE was simply the will of God.

Dear Rachael
     It has come to my attention that you'll be studying cosmetology next year at MCCC. I would like to congratulate you on furthering your education and turning from the path you were on last year.
     I must tell you that you have begun to become very vain. Last Sunday instead of focusing on my lesson you were doing your make up and playing with your hair, a good Christian woman's place is in support of her husband.
     I know it's hard for some of you teen girls to see this but when you stop fighting it you'll see that it's where God wants women to be.

This is his vision for /r/atheism to make it more what he thinks is ""the way"" it should be to ""educate"" people. This completely ignores the rest of people who may have been engaged by the other content and interested by it

He is so self involved to think that funny pics/quote/memes that have been shown to be more effective at reaching larger audiences

/r/atheism drew in atheists looking for a giggle, he had to fuck with a community to change it to his ""vision"". The audacity of this short sighted arrogant fool to attempt to change a communtiy which he has only shown to be NOT his community. He is an extremist on the fringes that doesnt understand the group as a whole and just wants to change things to make himself more comfortable. This bares a striking simalarity with religious extremists trying to rule over their entire group and not giving a shit about everyone within it.

1370533082.0,1fsnhh,Just sent this message to the mods of reddit.com,reese_ridley,227,95,108,"Greetings.

I'm writing to the mods of reddit.com because the current mods of /r/atheism has started restricting the freedom of speech that has long been enjoyed by the subreddit. Specifically they have started banning macro images on the subreddit and only allow serious posts. They fail to realize that there already was a subreddit exclusively for serious discussion called /r/TrueAtheism.

/r/atheism used to be a place where atheists could vent the frustrations that build up from everyday encounters with religious people. Many atheists live in religion heavy communites and have no one else to talk to. /r/atheism was the perfect place for them to come and vent with like-minded people and have a few laughs together about the silliness of some of the religious people in our lives.

The mods think that ""karma whoring"" image macros aren't worthwhile to atheistic discussions

If the mods are allowed to continue their dictatorial control and censorship of /r/atheism then future redditors who are in the process of losing their religion will be met by a sterile subreddit that only contains boring discussions and articles. Not the welcoming and hearty community that I have personally come to know and love. It isn't like there's no place for serious discussion

Please! I -like many other atheist redditors- am pleading to the moderators of reddit.com to liberate /r/atheism from censorship and restore free speech and fun to our beloved subreddit.

With sincere and humble pleading

1371032189.0,1g6rg3,The State of /u/jij's /r/atheism,Xtermo,268,132,67,"/u/jij keeps trying to assure us all that everything will be handled maturely soon

Content with inexcusably low vote ratings sits comfortably on the front page of /r/atheism because there is nothing left to drive competition with the content restrictions currently in place being enforced by the new, a relatively happy, uniform subreddit with over 2 million subscribers has seen schism the likes of which few could ever have predicted. It's not about images being good or bad anymore. It's about a sheer willingness to ignore the masses to enforce a vision, regardless of the results.

Quietly building up a mass of enforcers to address with force a swath of legitimate (if repetitious) complaints and questions is the act of a tyrant. Looking for popular support with a poll and then retreating behind rules identifying the moderators of a subreddit as its only policy-driving users is cowardice. Claiming he ""hasn't had time"" to address the discrepancies and enact changes to restore balance while rule changes are openly discussed a full week later is a lie. Dethroning the only person who would do anything about it is mutiny.

If /u/jij really cares at all about improving things at /r/atheism, and make an open suggestion to the users and mods regarding his ideas for how to enact change. Perhaps he will even forgive the admittedly underhanded, desperate tactics of people whose shelter from a storm of hate is currently being ruled over by a tyrannical coward of a lying mutineer. His actions thusfar suggest to me that this is not the case, however. 

Though some signs would seem to suggest otherwise, a dying subreddit. It now has *17* mods policing it for the very rules choking the content out of it. The sidebar rules now include:

""Images must be submitted in self-posts. Alternatively

and

""No meta posts

Which

""Images must be submitted in self-posts. We know this means it will be virtually impossible for image content to reach any degree of visibility, karma whores.""

and

""No meta posts asking for a real discussion about the changes we're making; please submit these in /r/AtheismPolicy [temporary rule until this blows over and we can quietly make banning metaposts critical of the moderatorship a permanent rule].""

**Do not post to /r/AtheismPolicy looking for answers.** Your concerns will **not** be honestly addressed and there is no genuine discussion to be had there. A bit of searching over its current top page reveals essentially no effort to engage the concerned dissenters at all. It's a complaint black hole to keep /r/atheism tidy. The only replies from its *11* moderators are /u/jij running the weakest interference / spin campaign I've seen in a long time.

Some highlights of this campaign include:

**/u/jij admits he *still* hasn't done the final tally for the vote that went landslide against his policies because he was too busy recruiting mods to shut up the complaints against him:**

/u/Diran: ""Where are the results from the vote?""

/u/jij: ""Unfortunately I haven't had time to finish it yet... mostly due to the troubles that necessitated adding more moderators to help out. I will finish it

Source: http://www.reddit.com/r/AtheismPolicy/comments/1g4jlr/the_mods_have_no_intention_to_listening_to/

**/u/jij on /u/skeen and how things are going:**

/u/jij: ""Skeen and the others are welcome to their opinions

**/u/jij admits to only one ""overly negative"" comment and voices his opinion of what the moderatorship is currently like and will be like in the future**

/u/jij:
""I said one overly negative thing once

**/u/jij defuses things by being on both sides of the argument***

/u/jij:
""...I like memes

Source: http://www.reddit.com/r/AtheismPolicy/comments/1g5mca/open_letter_to_the_new_mods_we_demand_answers/

**/u/jij on the mass bannings following the new moderators being added:**

/u/jij: ""mod-team got a little aggressive. I un-banned anyone I saw that they banned for hostile comments. However

Source: http://www.reddit.com/r/AtheismPolicy/comments/1g448e/new_atheism_policy_widespread_censorship/

To /u/jij: If you don't like all the negative press, and collaborate with us instead of ruling over us. If you do not, you only show that your need to control /r/atheism outweighs your desire to make improvements to it in the wake of the massive damage your actions are directly responsible for already. You've had plenty of time for considerations and to make things right, but instead you spent that time defending your case and rallying allies to your cause.

You've dug in far enough. Prove yourself respectable and rational by recognizing your failures as a leader and acting accordingly or prove yourself an egomaniac and hit the self-destruct on /r/atheism by announcing the permanence of the changes,,False,self,t5_2xguz,False,,True

I took notes.,nicka_please,154,33,58,"My mom is the only one in my family who regularly attends church and believes in Christianity. In the past few months she has become frustrated with her regular church's mannerisms (unprecedented acts like begging for money and shaming their members - what religious institution could do such a thing?). It was recently her birthday as well

Fortunately and unfortunately, above ground, inflatable pool in front of the stage. Here are the thoughts I collected and noted. Story in regular font, my own thoughts in italics:

‚Ä¢ A frail woman struggled to walk across the stage. She was guided and helped along by two of her friends, and, as a pedestrian, was hit by a drunk driver - this resulted in her frail body and trouble walking. She explained that she believed in and prayed to God all of her life but now she feels as though she needed forgiveness. Her baptism was met with heavy applause. ---  *Why does a ""omnipotent"" and ""benevolent"" God continue to get the benefit of the doubt, even in an awful story like this?*

‚Ä¢The next person who walked across stage didn't have a terribly special story, uh, yeah.](http://i.imgur.com/NsK0zph.jpg)*

‚Ä¢ Next a man walked across stage and in his testimony shared that he believed that his life was saved in a drunk driving accident simply because God had plans for him --- *Try telling that to the families of the 10

‚Ä¢When the next person walked across stage, then we're saying that God loves some people more than others. Nice.*

‚Ä¢ The next person to walk across the stage was a high-school age boy whose testimony explained a 6 day battle he had with the flu. He claimed that his medicine didn't work, flu patients of the world: I guess God plays favorites! Keep praying, though, God will heal you!*

What bothered me the most about all of this is that most of these people didn't ever question why they were put in such horrible positions in the first place. If I were a woman who had been raped, I don't think I'd be the one doing the apologizing. It was literally painful listening to people imply that God never deserves to be questioned.

I also want to thank everyone for their support of the ad and I appreciate the messages of support.  I will not have time to reply to all of you individually

1.  The intent of the ad was to provide a readily visible link to the members of r/a to find, and if they want, subscribe to atheismrebooted.  I found my way over here from messaging in the r/a sub before the bots/mods starting removing all posts/comments with links to atheismrebooted.  I wanted to provide a link to the users in r/a that may have been absent or missed the links.  If those users come to this sub, like the content and moderation, then they may subscribe.  

2.  Why an ad?  When the bots/mods started removing content linking to this sub it was clear that they (1) Would suppress any/all dissent and discussion of how r/a should be moderated, and (3) In order to provide a link to the users in r/a to this sub the only method that couldn't be suppress by the mods was an ad.

3.  Methodology.  Setting up an ad is surprisingly simple.  Click the link at the bottom of the page, if 2 people target /r/a and each spend the same amount, the ads will each get 50% of the views.  If 3 people spend 100 for 3 days, and one person spends 300 for 3 days, then the more expensive ad will get 50% of the traffic, and the other ads will each get ~16% of the ads.

4. Going Forward.  These are my thoughts and opinions, and based on the lottery system create diminishing returns on total amount of page views with our ads.  My guess is the attention this has gathered may attract other advertisers, which will make our ad dollars less effective.  I would nominate /u/NukeThePope to help lead this, I believe he was already looking at some coordination in this vein in another thread.

Cheers
