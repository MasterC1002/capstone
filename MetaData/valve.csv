What are my options at this point?  How did the individuals who were affected with trojans break past the first level of tech support and actually have someone look into the issue, not to mention it'd ruin the fun entirely. I did run trainers on single player games like Binding of Isaac on occassion, but nothing that would be designed to hook into source based games since there's a lot of downtime in those modes. I've ranged from reading e-books to movies to playing pauseable single player games. I've even run these side by side while playing other games like Planetside 2 while waiting for outfit formations and experienced no detection issues.
 
I've offered Valve the following and have been ignored and given canned responses: 
  * My gaming machine and all hard drives for analyses 
  * Bit-by-bit drive images of the 3 disks in the machine. 
  * Malware Bytes log of it locating an active trojan on my machine. 
  * Every demo that's written to disk on my server.  Which is about the only place I play on with the exception of when I'd play on a DeathRun server for TF2.

But the recent announcement that you won’t be able to access previous purchases unless the user accepts the terms is completely unreasonable and it made me look more closely at the contract.


Initial reactions by some people including myself was whether or not we should sue to get this repealed but thinking it over and doing a little research I see there is an alternative step that can be done before doing something so drastic


**My goal is to create a counter offer contract that revises two issues I think that are important.**

*1) The first issue is what options are available to a person who declines the terms of an EULA.*

*2) The second issue is that Steam is demanding for individual arbitration and we can’t as individuals consult or collaborate with the rest of our peers who are also going to an arbitration session with Valve without their consent (read: permission).*


Regarding (1) The current stance that we can’t access games we paid for is ridiculous. I’m mostly ok with EULA
Regarding (2) I agree with Valve that class action suits are expensive


If we give up the option to arbitrate as a group we concede some of the power that made class action lawsuits necessary in the first place. I personally consider it is in our best interest from a time and money stand point to arbitrate instead of litigate. You may disagree with that. But I think we would agree that group arbitration is better than individual.


For those who have second thoughts about that contract you already agreed to

Sure Valve starts out with negative profits, free game with such a limited replay value damn near FORCES the community to create new content.  If you like the game, you'll want it to last.  Some of us will actually start screwing around with the source sdk and hammer.

Even if the mod community totally fails us (unlikely) valve ends up with hundreds of people who are just that much better at making valve content.  If, maybe they are now making maps for TF2.

This is not to say that I think Alien Swarm is a throwaway game - far from it.  This little gem has, online play, experience, leveling, skill upgrades, character customization, and the list goes on.

Sure everything is limited in scope

So, one of the best things for me was the fact that the game had closed captions. Face it, you really need the dialog in these games.

So I decided to download half life source off of steam since I never played the first one. Well..I did not get very far in the game because without the captions I have no idea what is going on or what I am supposed to do.

Now, i'll take it.

Anyways

Here's the deal: I'm trying to connect to Valve's master server

Here's roughly what's supposed to happen: I send a query packet over UDP to the master server. This packet contains some info, I only get 200-something IPs per packet, and since UDP is not a connection-oriented protocol, I need to send a new request, including the last IP I received from the server, and get a new batch. This continues until I get an ""empty"" IP. I have all the IPs in the list now, and everybody's happy, no.

Here's what *does* happen: I try sending a packet, OR I get some IPs. Which is good, right? Wrong again. When I send my second query packet which **does** contain the last IP of the previous one like it should (I double checked.), I just get the first bulk again. And this can happen without having changed anything in my code at all.

I read on the [documentation page](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Master_Server_Query_Protocol) that this can happen if I'm closing the socket between each transmission, so I'm at my wits' end trying to figure this out.

Alternatively, that would be so much easier.

Again

If anybody has any clues how to fix this, please share. :)

1. **Stay on topic.** All submissions must be related to Valve somehow. This can cover any aspect of Valve, the Source engine, Steam, update speculation, promotions, cross-promotions, or the culture surrounding the company. A post will be removed if a textual explanation (such as a submission title or a caption overlaid onto an image) is required to establish how the post is related to Valve. This bans most internet memes and reaction gifs.

2. **Posts that are solely about a single game might belong elsewhere.** While /r/valve moderators will not remove posts that are only related to a single Valve game

3. **No commercial advertisement.** Posts advertising paid products/services such as server rental, or items for sale will be removed. This rule does not apply to *free* livestreams, public server events, Steam workshop creations, or non-paid services like TF2Lobby.

4. **Bigotry and hateful language will not be tolerated on this subreddit.** The philosophy here is that the subreddit should be a safe place for anyone to come and enjoy themselves talking about Valve stuff, a minority, disabled, and so forth. Discussion about issues are fine so long as they are related to Valve and the discussion is respectful.

5. **Heavily insulting another user is unacceptable.** If you call someone a moron or a terrible player

6. **Starting or participating in raids from other subreddits is forbidden.** Posting links to /r/valve content in *relevant places* elsewhere on Reddit is perfectly fine, please click the report button rather than use it as justification to launch a raid from elsewhere.

* Steam will need to be outfitted with a Credits system that can be used only for purchasing new games/DLCs. It should have two decimal places. It cannot be cashed.
* The users should be able to set the price of their games OR have a fixed selling percentage based on current non-discount value
* If users have a coice in price
* A completed game implies gameplay satisfaction
* Games that are unsatisfactory upon purchase, too bad.
* Gifted
* A re-subbed game cannot be sold for more than it was bought for AND/OR cannot be re-subbed more than once/twice. In conflict with the price mininum

----

* The re-sub market goes by first-come first-sell. I think this would operate best with fixed-price re-subbing.
* Game discounts in the retail market do not affect the price of re-subs to maintain competition. Companies should be allowed to compete with the huge Steam userbase and re-subbing from the traditional operation perspective is a curtesy from Valve(or a legal right if the lawsuit in Germany wins).
* Companies should have a say in whether or not their games can be re-subbed. All or nothing

----

* DLCs attached to the game are added to the total retail value and affect the miminum price allowed.
* A re-sub game lists all the seperate DLCs people are selling it with so users can choose the one with or without DLCs.
* Individual DLCs less than some amount of money cannot be sold individually and must be sold with the entire game.",self,t5_2qzqs,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/valve/comments/180ew6/proposal_for_allowing_games_to_be_resubscribed_or/

It is appalling that the game is so broken that I can't get through a single game of versus without myself or someone in the lobby being sent back to the valve screen. Not to mention the fact that some days the servers have no fucking gravity and everyone just levitates everywhere. 

I'll watch everyone in the lobby red bar on their connection then suddenly all jump to green when we switch sides and then back to red when we switch sides again. 

What justification can there be for such a gross lack of support when the DLC and game are still for sale on XBL basically being sold broken and unplayable? 


This isn't just a versus problem. For example, L4d1 maps, etc) but then to turn around and offer zero support feels like a real kick in the ass. An update would be nice, an explanation would be nice. Anything but what is currently going on with this game would be an improvement.

I know your really smart and make great games and products

I just want you to know

I think that a ladder system for solo-queue and what not is required for multiple good reasons. Including teaching new players to play. They want to climb ranks

Now, especially who are professionals, would like your game more. I know friends who won't play your game because they can't rank.

The most important thing

**Rank system, should be implemented as similiar as to SC2, but.... no item rewards or battle points are given or whatever you decide to reward people for playing your game...**

This makes it so that people have to play normal queue if you implemented a rank queue. It's not often you see people bragging on what rank they are and how good they are. You know why? Do people brag how much money they make then another? No
