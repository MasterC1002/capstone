I do not use your service as a social network. I do not care what videos the people to whom I am subscribed like or dislike nor do I care what videos they have commented upon. I do not hold your video recommendations to be as important as videos uploaded by people to whom I am subscribed. Adding two extra clicks to my experience with your site is neither simpler nor more convenient.

They are definitely doing it

Instead of introducing better H.264 compression
That's just ridiculous.
They could keep the same quality of 720p

And instead of knocking me down to 144p or 240p

One theory: Youtube might be purposely crippling their H.264 compression to make WebM and vp9 quality not seem so far off. When the reality is

If youtube introduced H.265 compression, but h.265 is seriously THAT MUCH BETTER.

We also can't seek ahead with what is claimed to be seekable, only to find it instantly DELETES everything I have downloaded previously and starts all over again. The same fucking thing happens when I go backwards on previous viewed parts of a video.
All this initializing and waiting, it stops buffering when it's buffered about 10 seconds ahead, this is absolutely crazy.

Not only that

Youtube is a NIGHTMARE for people with poor internet connections

I've also noticed I can not click ahead to (for e.g.) 5:00 until 0:01 has loaded. If I click on 5:00
I end up clicking and clicking and clicking, even though it needs to initialize 0:01 first!! So my video just never loads.

These fixes are very very simple and basic to implement

And don't even get me started on the retarded new channel pages which look like a barf of videos everywhere. And no one wants to use full names, but even then it seems most would feel it's an invasion of privacy, even more so than facebook because at least facebook has privacy settings.

Youtube has progressively been getting worse, since the end of 2007. It has never once gotten better, not even for a little while.

And the video ads on top of all this is just the fucking shit sprinkles on top. I couldn't ever consider using youtube again without an ad blocker. If youtube worked CORRECTLY
It would be nice if youtube intialised the first few seconds of the video whilst the ad is playing so the video will play instantly afterwards

Did you know youtube has been trying to KILL the ""charts"". Youtube don't want you to see what is universally popular. You can no longer see videos with ""the most comments"" or ""the most likes"". The only thing you can do is see ""the most viewed"" but you can't even get to the page from within youtube! it's crazy! the url is http://www.youtube.com/charts . If you click on the drop down, only most viewed.

Does anyone else see this? It's crazy. I really wish we could start a campaign to start insulting the youtube programmers. I want them to feel like shit for creating shit, it is an important facility, but they're ruining it. They should be ashamed of themselves.

[My response to blocking IP ranges](http://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/196170/how_to_stop_time_warner_cable_sucking_at_youtube/c8rw4rj)

So both of the quick fixes may have the intended speed increase momentarily

- My assumptions of excluding 'c.youtube.com' from DNS were wrong.  There were a few nay-sayers which I asked to provide proof when saying I was wrong earlier. I even asked if they'd like to team to work the problem out. Only one took the offer. Even still

- Mitch Ribar's assumptions are also inaccurate.  Additionally


These two links were a godsend and I'd like to thank the authors for there hard work and research.
First link is a PDF and I think this PDF disproves Mitch and I. The second link is the winner.

# [Details the way the cache sites are used and connected.](http://www-users.cs.umn.edu/~viadhi/resources/youtubehotmd.pdf)
# [Details the way the HTTP parameters are utilized.](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ett.2546/full)


The exclusion of cache servers may or may not increase the overall speed/quality of your Youtube experience.  There are many factors outlined in the first PDF.  For instance

- lscache
- tccache
- cache
- rhost (generic)
- rhostisp (generic)

From what I can gather

""...YouTube servers apply a data rate limitation of about 1.25 Mbps."" - Analysis and modeling of YouTube traffic

""The presented results have shown that YouTube's progressive download commences by transferring an initial burst of 40 s of data at the Internet's maximum available bandwidth and later applies a throttling algorithm that imposes a data rate equal to 1.25 (i.e. the throttling factor) times the video clip encoding rate.""  - Analysis and modeling of YouTube traffic

Conversely

If you were to open the source code you will see these parameters. The excerpt below shows what I mean.

""yt.preload.start(""http://r8---sn-ab5e6nsl.c.youtube.com/generate_204?ipbits=8\u0026fexp=916603%2C912506%2C913810%2C904310%2C916612%2C920704%2C912806%2C902000%2C919512%2C929901%2C913605%2C925006%2C906938%2C931202%2C931401%2C908529%2C930807%2C930803%2C920201%2C930101%2C930603%2C906834\u0026id=6aa09c40e943338a\u0026signature=98451E574DF00A9672C4C9106D16EFFB07B291DC.7589F108EC4A8A046783AE56AD322962059997AC\u0026burst=40\u0026algorithm=throttle-factor\u0026key=yt1\u0026expire=1362835124\u0026newshard=yes\u0026ip=UR.IP.ADR.HERE\u0026upn=udSvm76eos0\u0026cp=U0hVR1hOU19HTkNONV9QSFdCOkFON3Q2cE9SN1ZV\u0026sparams=algorithm%2Cburst%2Ccp%2Cfactor%2Cid%2Cip%2Cipbits%2Citag%2Csource%2Cupn%2Cexpire\u0026factor=1.25\u0026sver=3\u0026source=youtube\u0026mt=1362811634\u0026mv=m\u0026itag=35\u0026ms=au""

u0026factor=1.25 &lt;--- This is the data rate 

It seems Youtube only limits the data rate via HTTP parameters.  If someone was to manipulate this value on-the-fly by using an extension/add-on then we'd have a winner.

To experiment with the Youtube video you'd like to watch: Select the quality, find data rate change &amp; save, now open the local copy. 

If anyone has any recommendations or would like to help with analysis please message me.

""This new subscriptions design is far below the expected quality of YouTube.  It should be noted that this new design completely undermines the idea of YouTube. Users should be able to post and watch videos with ease.

With the old layout

The new layout, reducing the efficiency tremendously. When a video is watched, it is simply tagged as ""watched."" This makes watched videos take up space, which is also inefficient.

Please keep in mind that the descriptions of videos are rarely used in the intended way. They are mainly used to provide additional information about the video that is only useful after the user watches said video (such as links, the amount of text that will fit in the subscriptions area is very small, rendering them useless in the first place.

I am getting this front page at work. I am still getting the ""old""(?) front page at home for god knows what reason. But I want to raise the issue with the community, of course, people agree with my sentiment.

The new front page is utterly retarded:

- I can't see my subscriptions easely. I see a lot of recommended videos, it takes forever to spot a new upload, and they are far and wide apart.
- If I click my ""258 subscriptions"" at the top
- The only way I can see the latest video from one of my subscriptions is by clicking on them in the menu to the left - and only if they appear. I can choose who to show in the left menu, go to their channel page.
- The ""Recommended"" channels to the right is stupid. I don't want to subscribe to someone just by their name and image

As a Youtube viewer, I have to see content that Youtube think I might like to see.

As a content creator myself, but are instead having random videos forced upon them, then the user does not get what he want, and content creators will find a drop in views.

These are the things I believe need fixing:

1) Center everything.

2) Allow customization of background color. The current white is blinding.

3) Make ""My Subscriptions - Uploads only"" the default homepage.

4) ""Recommended videos"" on the right

5) Quit trying to give YouTube a Facebook/Google+ vibe, not a Timeline™ showing when I created my playlists.

6) Add a ""Play All"" and ""Remove all"" buttons immediately accessible to the ""Watch later playlist"".

7) The ""Guide"" on the left is fine

That's all I can think of at this moment.

I wanted to get some thoughts from the YouTube community about banned accounts.

Basically I had a channel with 10 or so videos of me doing a let's play (playing a game). I had only about 300 views. The developers openly announced they support players to make these kinds of videos. I used no copyrighted material in my videos where I did not seek out permission, etc and was anal about making sure I had all the right licenses and permissions.

After doing several of those videos I decided to do a new let's play series on the new simcity game (I think this was my mistake). While the EA claims it's ok to do let's plays of simcity

I go to log in one day and it says my account has been banned for repeat violations of the community guidelines. Here's the useless message incase you've not had seen it before.

We'd like to inform you that due to repeated or severe violations of our Community Guidelines [link] your YouTube account [account name] has been suspended. After review we determined that activity in your account violated our Community Guidelines, possessing or creating any other YouTube accounts. For more information about account terminations and how our Community Guidelines are enforced, please visit our Help Center at [link].

I've read the guidelines and can not find any of them that were violated. I tried the horrible appeals form which basically just collects your email and there's no way to send them a simple message. Basically they say

It infuriates me they don't even show you why you were banned. If YouTube really want's to improve copyright infringement they need to do a better job of educating the masses on when they do something wrong (if they did anything wrong to begin with). I don't think most people go around trying to infringe. All I wanted to do was share my game play with the game's community.

Even thought it said I'm ""banned for life"" I created another account

Does anyone have any experience with dealing with YouTube's horrible customer service on this issue? How far were you able to get with your appeal and if you managed to get your account back

TL;DR
YouTube account was banned and no explanation given. Read community guidelines and can not find any that I violated.

**tl;dr** Videos wouldn't load like they used to



Recently I discovered what had given me my woes.


One day while watching a video I decided to right click and look and the video info for the download speed. [This is what I saw.](http://i.imgur.com/YmlHu.jpg)


This download speed seemed abnormally low as I expected to see


I switched over to 240p resolution to see how much better the speeds would be


Of course I didn't want to watch any video in 240p so I switched back to 720p to continue viewing.



Somehow

I then noticed a big difference between the 720p when I initially loaded the video

This was the breakthrough I had. I don't know how, videos must have changed to be loaded in TagStreamPlayer by default rather than HTTPVideoPlayer, which I assume is the player YouTube's always had. HTTPVideoPlayer allowed me to load videos at muuuuucchh faster speeds and allowed me to load when paused. 



***So here's what you have to do if you are having the same problems I did:***

**1) Once on video page

**2) Switch back to 720p**

**3) You should now be on HTTPVideoPlayer

**NOTE: This is not a permanent fix

I tried to create a second Youtube account for a project I'm going to start, but I noticed that what you enter in the name fields become your Youtube username. I'm a picky little fucker, so I don't want a space in my Youtube name. I found some instructions and took a trip to my Google account settings, pressed ""edit"" under my email address, and found out that I can have a nickname. I typed in my nickname and nothing happened. My Youtube name was not changed. I'm not sure if I interpreted the instructions correctly, but I've tried everything else I can think of.

1. **Browse Box** - Restore the browse box above the video so you can see a chronological listing of videos from the same user.
 * http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/154471
 * For Chrome users
2. **YouTube Options** - Center the Layout and allow downloads of videos.
 * https://spoi.com/software/yto/
3. **Subs on Homepage** - Set the homepage to show only the uploads from subscribed channels. This also makes the YouTube logo link to this page as well.
 * https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/klljlfcipmgohgfdgmliaobikgdoeaah
4. **Rating Preview** - Show a thin bar under the thumbnails for videos to see their ratings. Know ahead of time that something isn't worth your time before even giving them an undeserved view (I'm looking at you ""Reply Girls"")
 * https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/youtube-ratings-preview/cgbhdenfmgbagncdmgbholejjpmmiank
5. **Put the browse box above the guide** - This is how to fix conflicts with the annoying new guide sidebar covering up your content.
 * Get the Extension Stylebot: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/oiaejidbmkiecgbjeifoejpgmdaleoha
 * Go to Youtube.com
 * Click ""Edit CSS"" then copy/paste this in to the box and hit save:

            #yt-uix-clickcard-card1 { display: none; }
            #moreUserVideos { margin: 0px auto; }
            #showHideButton {
            margin: 5px 0px 5px 200px !important;
            z-index: 999;
            position: relative; }
 * If you want to get rid of the stupid guide sidebar all together (as it's borderline useless)

            #guide-container { display: none; }
6. **Stop this from happening yet again** - And finally send an E-mail to the CEO of YouTube to request he fire the incompetent morons in charge of the latest update that was rolled out before it was finished. There are a lot of intelligent and talented people out there who deserve to have the job of making YouTube better
 * Salar.Kamangar@YouTube.com

Seriously, you can expect it to come back sometime when we figure out how it worked"". Asshats.

* * *

**NOTE:** As the site is updated and slowly **finished**
