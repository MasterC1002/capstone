**Blessedfalcon** = Original Poster of the defaming thread:
http://www.reddit.com/r/Minecraft/comments/1f5l09/i_got_banned_for_building_this_3500_carrot_farm/

A single post concerning our server just blew all other posts, 1536 points!). Too bad it is defamatory, dishonest and blatantly untrue :(

The post generated a lot of hate and misunderstanding (you could say it griefed our server) - but it was all wrong! I feel the need to clarify things to the splendid people of /r/Minecraft and show you how you have been deceived


**Some real facts:**

**1)** Blessedfalcon was definitely not banned for building a carrot farm. That is blatantly untrue. Here is why:

**2)** In fact

23 May 2013

I then asked you about six times via in-game /msg to talk with me

So a ban it is.

If you care to state your case in the forum

Followed by:

24 May 2013, when someone with a red name repeatedly in-game PMs you, asks in local AND in general to get your attention. DO NOT ignore them. Could've saved everyone a lot of effort to have a quick conversation.""
*

**3)** Maturity clarification: Our server is by grown-ups for grown-ups. We do accept late teenagers though. Blessedfalcon is born 1996

**4)** Where does the farm come in? Blessedfalcon was a member of a Towny town on the server

Now I'm sure Blessedfalcon had the best intentions for building it - perhaps for helping the town and probably got frustrated that the mayor didn't want it there (who lashed out a bit hard to be honest - but he is a regular player

We were actively trying to solve the issue

Frustration does not excuse a completely misleading and blatantly lying post on /r/Minecraft!

There was no ban for any of this. Indeed

Now (today!) we find out he is ""high"" on the whored karma of his recent /r/Minecraft success - and is trying to ""steal"" away players to some other server he got offered to build the farm on - including our resident streamer

    [INFO] FixarJocke -&gt; blessedfalcon: what?

    [INFO] blessedfalcon -&gt; FixarJocke: basically I was planning on building a green house around it
    
(Really doesn't seem to look highly on reddit... He thinks he can fool and mislead you obviously...)


**Case closed:**

We don't like to ban much (other than verified cheaters), weaseling, disruptive player in our community (which is quite nice btw!).

How can we then motivate this ban? We got a lot of flack for being ""arbitrary"". Well


*Important rule #1: This server is intended for mature adults with more than half a brain and we expect EVERYONE here to behave accordingly.* 

**I would dare say that rule was broken... several times indeed... Including lying to /r/Minecraft about being banned!**


*2. Be courteous and respect others. Agree to disagree. No fighting

**Hmm.. this one too**


*3. Real world legal and societal laws and rules apply! Just use your common sense

**Rule definitely broken in several ways**


*8. Aim to build within reasonable distance from each other. Minimum distance before it is customary to ask for permission is 128 blocks (=Normal Render Distance)

**
100% verified broken (the farm). Note: We never ever banned someone for breaking this rule - including him. We always just tend to just sort it out. The rule is there not to even end up in this situation.
**

*10. Always obey the admins &amp; moderators (red color names). Report misbehaviour, pm's, or mumble. Do no bother them unnecessarily, and NEVER EVER bother us for op or admin rights.*

**Rule Broken! Did not follow directions or listen at all...**


Blessedfalcon

/OM

---

**UPDATE:** And we have a reply/explanation below from Blessedfalcon himself

**UPDATE2:** It was deleted (though reposted by others)

**UPDATE3:** We had a little chat on the server - he wasn't banned

**UPDATE4:** Wow

**UPDATE5:** And now we are near drowning in the RDOS (Reddit Denial of Service) - I did not intend for this to be a server infomercial! We have great dedicated hardware, we are not equipped to handle the unexpected RDOS. If the server lags or is plain too full, please come back another time (when business as usual - off reddit)...

**UPDATE6:** The RDOS is over/diminshed and we just officially passed the ""other"" post in comments, I love you right back!

- Some kind of humming/whirring sound when the dragon's health is recharged by ender crystals
- Roaring as the dragon comes in for an attack
- Long
- A higher pitched roar/screech when the dragon gets hit
- Wings flapping sound
- Woosh as the dragon flies by
- Sound of blocks breaking when the dragon flies through and destroys blocks
- Boss battle music (thanks to Demoted_Axel for the reminder)

Something.  Anything.  It's the final boss of the game and it still seems like an afterthought.  There's no atmosphere.. no immersion whatsoever.

So a while ago, there's even a ""minceraft"" mockup t shirt design we did) instead of ""Minecraft"" on every 10000th game launch or so, and nobody found it! I was so happy about that, I finally knew something about the game the players didn't know.

Flash forward to this GDC a few days ago, and I say yes. I should've said no, but I said yes. Then I start getting emails and tweets about it, people start getting excited, and knowing how minor the secret is, I try to tell people it's a very minor secret. That seems to fuel the flames. A reporter from a well known gaming site wants to run an article on it, and I tell him not to. Getting people hyped up about an intentional typo isn't really a good way to spend everyone's time.

There's a lot of cool stuff to learn from this, they will find it. Another thing is that people seem to want to get excited over things, even if you tell them it's nothing major.

I'm impressed and relieved you found it. I won't comment on it outside of this subreddit.",self,t5_2r05i,False,,mojang,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/Minecraft/comments/qqenq/minceraft_a_post_mortem/

My name is Jens Bergensten and I'm known as ""jeb_"" here at reddit, Notch wanted to try new things and handed the project lead to me. I am now working with the four ex-bukkit members on Minecraft, and will probably continue to do so for a while.

Thanks to 1.6, although most of the time you won't want to do that (especially when shooting at someone while sailing).

Due to the new controls, as you have no way of slowing down other than releasing the W key.

Since 1.6, there is a likelihood of you pushing it far away from you, causing you to go swim after it just to retrieve it.

I've met some excellent people on reddit, even though sometimes the truth can hurt. Because of posts here I've been able to talk to Notch. I often think about how much /r/Minecraft has helped me, but I want to take this milestone to vocalize it.

Thank you.

Discuss

Edit: Woah

- The deeper into a cave

- Stronger mobs that take a challenge to kill

- The armour on Zombies should be in decay as well. Part of the armour

- Why full armour? Why not a cap for one zombie, rather than ""I just happened to find full golden armour just a while back"".

- A toggle on/off option for drop loot on mobs. Some people want the reward

- An in-between option where spawned loot is sometimes dropped

- Zombies replace ""players"". They should behave like them

- **Here's another idea I had right before falling asleep last night: what if there were special weapons/armour that *only* zombies could spawn with? Taking a leap here: Rotten Flesh armour. The rotten flesh they drop, or just by themselves. That way, you have a reason to hunt zombies, because you can't get that rotten flesh armour anywhere else.**

- The longer the player is around

- Peaceful

I went on many adventures on that jungle island, I loved that cat with all of my cubic heart. I made a lavish underground base, as I am wont to do, and made an entire wing devoted to Kitty. He had a wool floor, a wool column for scratching, and a chest full of fish. I thought that maybe, just maybe

I decided he needed a pool of water to drink from and stare at fish in. I walled off the area so he couldn't see me build it. I wanted it to be a surprise. When I finished and tore down the wall, dove in, and sunk to the bottom. I was then forced to watch in horror as he drowned himself. Kitty stared me in the eyes the entire time.

&gt;Dear [my minecraft username]

&gt;I am returning your mine-craft account to you

&gt;Your password has been changed back to what it was before.

&gt;Please change it and keep your details safe this time. Alot of phishing sites out there.

Admittedly

However

And sure enough

I cannot think of any way the sender of the email could exploit me

Just wanted to share this rather curious incident. 

EDIT: I'm afraid that I might not have been clear enough here: I did not receive this email from the incorrect email I mailed. It was from a totally random email address called 'notanonymous' and five numbers. Not sure if I should be posting it, and a google of both the message and email address returned nothing.

It's a very popular game in the french-speaking minecraft community, every multiplayer server has a ""D√© √† Coudre"".


Here is how to play this game : http://imgur.com/a/4NRqr
(All the screenshots are coming from this video : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rYJFrc1es7k . This is the video that made the game famous)

But this is only what the player sees.

The code reveals that Minecraft is horribly inefficient. Performing unnecessary calculations

This is why I would like a patch. Mojang, and mobs, I urge you to make the existing ones *work properly*. We like these new things, like horses, but when big issues are seemingly ignored, it can get a bit annoying.

Thanks for your time :)

So it's decided. Starting tomorrow (September 24th

The only exception to ""24 hours straight"" is 5 minute breaks for food and going to the bathroom, and to raise awareness towards it's awesomeness.

Some might also view this as a practice run for (hopefully) many more marathons on different video games that I hope to broadcast. I have been testing out ManyCam

If anyone can suggest a program to broadcast my desktop with less lag

OK so now those who do not know, ""What on earth does that mean and how will it effect me?"". The answer to that is, it will effect any one playing on multiplayer, sprinting will take a varied amount of time depending on your ping to the server (How fast you can ""talk"" or transfer data to the server and receive a response). This means that if you have say a 200ms ping, your sprint will take approximately 1 - 2 seconds from when you double tapped W to initiate. Not enough explantation? Watch this video:

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wlru0g2Qeo8&amp;feature=youtu.be

Listen for when he double taps W

Please show your support for this as it really really ruins the game for me and a lot of people, this is one of the worst changes I've experienced.

If you feel the same way about this change as I do

Thanks.

There has been talk about why we don't have an overworld boss. Why doesn't Mojang take the old ""giant"" and turn it into a jack-and-the-beanstalk type of boss.

Here's the basic idea.

You have to take
a block of endstone (so a trip to the end is required) and right click it with magic seeds (grass seeds that have been treated with magma cream

The result would be a magic beanstalk. It would grow over time until it reaches y=200. At that point

If the cloud giant is knocked off the cloud

The giant would of course have to be retextured to look cool. Not like a zombie. Maybe it could have a lightning strike attack. That'd be fun and new for a minecraft mob...

## Minecraft should support OpenJDK

Back when Sun owned Java, the reference implementation is [the OpenJDK](https://blogs.oracle.com/henrik/entry/moving_to_openjdk_as_the), and it is the JVM that's easily available and installable on Ubuntu (and other distros). Installing the Oracle JVM is an advanced task, it should not be required.

## Minecraft should use a compatible lwjgl version

Even if they can't upgrade lwjgl on all platforms for compatibility reasons, hard and error-prone for the average user.

To sum up, let's get our voice heard.

Edit.: These issues probably do affect other distributions as well

Some answers to common reactions:

  * *""You chose to run Linux

  * *""Only a fraction of users run Linux""* - The answer is the same as above

  * *""If installing Oracle Java is advanced for you, but I don't think that people who have problem with it are stupid, and you shouldn't either. People are different and are good at different things. If you are good with computers, good for you. But still, this is missing the point. It should work without the PITA process of getting the Oracle JVM installed. Plus, one of the bugs I linked is a bug that says it does not work with the Oracle JVM either.

  * *""I'm running Minecraft on &lt;insert Linux distro here&gt; and it works fine""* - Good for you. It doesn't for many people

I want to say one thing first - don't be afraid of a bit of complexity. You're used to Minecraft being simple, moreso something just to inform people about what's to come and allows us to gain some early feedback on the ideas, so we can see what people want added / changed / removed.

**Feel free to post your feedback, it is appreciated!**

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I figure I'll start with a 'tl;dr' for those of you who dislike reading a lot:


Minecraft¬≥ is a very large mod that is in development for Minecraft. It revamps many of the systems in the game - levelling, etc. - while also adding a massive amount of new content to the game. There is also the introduction of multi-stage boss fights that go beyond shooting your bow over and over at something roaming around in the sky either charging or shooting at you. If you want a more 'complete' outline of some of the features, continue reading on.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Contents of this post:

* Leveling - What's Changed.
* Mob Spawning &amp; ""Why does it matter?""
* Loot!
* Brief Overview of Some 'New' Content
* How to get the Latest News / How to Help

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

***Leveling***

One of the major things we've addressed in the mod is the 'levelling' system. It really didn't serve much of a purpose and felt more like a currency for purchasing upgrades than an actual 'level' system. While that isn't necessarily a *bad* thing, random loot, and various other game mechanics.


*Rate of Levels*

Obviously, it's all relative to how fast we want the game to progress), however the rate will most likely be much slower than it is currently in the game.


*Perks*

With the addition of a new level system


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

***Mob Spawning &amp; Why it Matters***

Most people probably will think ""What in the world could you change about... mobs spawning?"". Well, are outlined below.


*Visual Variations*

Obviously, applied to zombies, in this video:
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_ddzv_YdLk


*Other Variations?*

Now, having the same stats / speed, and posing the exact same problem to the player. This is where we expanded on the idea of 'mob variations' quite a bit. Each mob, first of all, has a randomized size within a +-30% range of their base size. Each mob also has a chance to be a 'giant' and become enlarged by 80%(with the +-30% still being applied). This isn't just some visual change, however. The larger a mob is, the more health it has, and the slower it moves. Smaller mobs are weaker but move faster. The larger a mob is also makes it more resistant to knockback when hit. There are a few other changes


*Wait

That I did. As you level up, and pose different challenges than the normal mob would. These 'variation mobs' get added to the mob spawn lists as you level up, meaning that when you reach a high level, things will actually be more difficult and dangerous in the world. Here's a little screenshot: http://i.imgur.com/A1d2J.png

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

***Loot***


Ah


* Tool / weapon levels
* Different item 'rarities'
* Procedurally generated weapon appearances.
* Different weapon stat focuses

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

***Brief Overview of Some 'New' Content***


* Dungeons - [There are many new dungeons implemented in Minecraft¬≥](http://i.imgur.com/sWvPW.jpg). They aren't just 'oh cool, mini-bosses, unique mobs, and various other challenges. They don't just end when you get the relic, either... ;)

* Bosses - Building on top of the addition of new dungeons, which is a multi-stage fight that in the end deals with you defeating the creeper queen(some other stuff happens when you do that, but again, I don't want to spoil these things!).

* Biomes - Many of the biomes are being revamped with new content and [changes to generation](http://i.imgur.com/RalG0.jpg). On top of that, massive chunk of water. Our goal is to make it actually fun to explore in, through things like new mobs, sunken treasure, underwater cities, hidden ruins, and more. Here's something from the Nether: http://i.imgur.com/8XaIX.jpg

* Currency gained from doing various tasks &amp; killing mobs

Last night we flattened a hill so we could build a villager farm and rebuild the crop farm (we started in a village with no villagers so it was empty and harvesting wheat/carrots/potatoes in the generated farms sucks after a while). After finishing the villager farm
&gt;hello

It's just us playing on a private server and she's sitting in the next room well within earshot so I start looking around to see where she's peeping at me from. I can't find her. I said  
&gt; hi

No response. I think nothing of it and finish the farm. Later as we're getting ready for bed we had this conversation:

Me|Her
:----|:----
 | You didn't tell me the villagers don't talk.
Huh? | 
 | The villagers. They don't talk.
No. They don't. *O.o* | 
 | One came up to me while you were working on the farm and he kept staring at me
You can trade with them
 | No
