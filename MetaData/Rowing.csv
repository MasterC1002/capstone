So, and you're maybe a month or two into your season. You've been on the water a lot, you're feeling fit, and then after Friday practice, your coach says those four dreaded words: ""Erg tests next week"".

Immediately a shadow is cast over your weekend. Your palms start to sweat and you're having trouble breathing. ""Life is over

the test is on Monday, at least) get stupid drunk and have too much fun whenever possible, what's a guy or gal to do with all their free time?

**YOUR BODY**

First of all, but considering you want to be primed come Monday afternoon it might be a good idea to skip the ice cream and fried chicken. Eat lean, get your colors and your carbs, drink water, and eat ENOUGH. Don't starve yourself or anything like that, if anything eat a little bit too much during the weekend, because Monday you'll a. want to have an empty-ish stomach for your piece and b. probably be too jumpy and amped to get a square meal in anyway. If practice is at 4, keep drinking water, nap, and your body will not punish you for it.

**YOUR MUSIC**

There are literally over ten thousand threads in this subreddit about erg music. Obviously, here are some of my favorites, as well as a bunch that others have posted in erg music threads. Note: I took music from the top few comments in the music threads I could find, and the results were... varied. Here are some:

**YOUR MIND**

Okay, and that's doubly true for rowing. You're literally willing yourself through pain on an erg. You're not even going anywhere. That said, this is my two cents on how to mentally prepare. 

* **Have a plan, and importantly it breaks up a daunting task (holy shit I have to erg 5000 meters) into a few reasonable ones (5 by 1k? Okay.). Know what splits you want, when you want them, and how to appropriately react to less-than-ideal circumstances. In other words, take as much control over your piece as you can.

* **Focus on doing, and right now it doesn't exist. You have erging to do right now- get to it. For example, it's much more effective to tell yourself ""okay, holding a 1:48, nice and steady. Keep it up, self"" than to say ""damn, this 1:48 is killing me... and I still have 1200m left. Shit."" This only serves to stress you out and take the focus away from the work at hand, which would make you more stressed. Don't think; react. Do.

* **Remove the word 'failure' from your vocabulary.** Sometime in your rowing career, you have two options: you can let that piece defeat you and frustrate you, or you can use that piece to make you faster. The only mistakes are those you don't learn from. This holds true to rowing, as well. So you had a bad piece: you also just got in an incredible workout. Look at your splits; did you fly and die? Were your legs a little tight? Did you not warm up enough? Are you hydrated? Were you mentally prepared for your piece? There is always a reason, or reasons, why you do or do not PR. Understand them, and use this knowledge to inform your strategy for your next piece.

User smokebathsalts also had some really good things to say about stress:

&gt;Cannot emphasis enough how important it is to not stress out too much over erg tests. Going into a test with a head full of anxiety and panic is just about the worst thing you can do, and it's been pretty well documented that stress (especially to the level most rowers experience it before a test) negatively impacts performance.


**RACE STRATEGY**

Okay, and a few lesser-known tests. In the fall you'll be doing mostly 5k pieces (6k's being a lesser-utilized option) and in the spring you'll be testing with 2k pieces (or 2.5k). For shits and giggles you might do a 10k as well, but that's not used nearly as much as an erging benchmark. Here's a rundown on strategy for each basic piece.

* *The 5k and 6k*

A big thanks to Clyde_Frag for starting off the discussion on these longer pieces.
&gt;For longer type pieces, you cannot forget the fundamentals of the rowing stroke.
&gt;
&gt;When it gets hard and you start getting to a dark place (which it inevitably will if you are pushing yourself the right way) just focus on getting to the next 500 meter marker. When you are in extreme pain and you still have 2500 meters left to go in your 6k test, chances are that I will have a nice PR. Don't be scared of the pain. Take solace in the fact that you are over coming your body's mental barriers by erg testing.

In addition to that, and then dropping your splits over the last thousand or so until your sprint. Often, dropping splits mid-piece can be unsustainable, and there is nothing worse psychologically than watching your splits creep up past your target with a lot of distance left. Preparation and pacing are key for these pieces. A good base stroke rate will put you between 24 and 30 strokes per minute, although 26-28 is more common.

* *The 2k and 2.5k*

These pieces are much quicker and arguably much more intense than 5ks and 6ks. In these situations, is often encouraged. That said, these pieces are also so short that you're going to be dropping your split soon enough anyway, although it is possible to neutral split these as well. Relative to other pieces, the average rower's 500m split for a 2k should be between 5 and 7 seconds faster for a 2k than a 5k or 6k. Stroke rate is also higher, in the 30-34 range and possibly even higher.

* *The 10k and 30 minute piece*

These pieces are generally not used for the purposes of formal testing, and it takes a lot more mental fortitude to finish these pieces well. It really comes down to your resolution to finish a piece out well.

Heart's raceing

You see ""Attention"" on the monitor in front of you

You pull as hard as you can, a third pull and the display reads 1:41... You think much better but not where I need to be. After a 1:32, and a 1:28, you see a 1:21 on the readout and you are thrilled.

At the corner of the screen you see that you have 1933 meters to go and the voice of your coxswain says calmly... time to settle. Part of you wants to keep pulling 1:21's because it feels so easy right now, and your rate and your split are right on target 27 beats per minute with a 500m split of 1:35.

Next thing you know, ""2 breaths per stroke"", as you begin feeling heat eminating from your quadraceps. You don't want to do the math, but your brain does it anyway ""7 1/2 % into this thing is too early to feel like this"". You quickly dismiss that feeling as quickly as you can and you start getting into the new rhythm of 2 breaths per stroke.

At first its a bit awkward

Your eyes are fixed on that that split. 1:35, 1:37, and then panic sets in and you give it an extra push 1:33. Your coxswain tells you, watch your split, don't overcorrect, and you find that grove again at 1:35. You look up and you see 1377 meters to go. You think to yourself ""A third, less than a third, but it doesn't matter

The 1:21 that seemed so easy just a couple of minutes ago seems like an impossible feat right now. You find your splits slipping more and more. You decide to bring it up a beat. The next stroke you rush the slide a little more than you probably should

You scan the top distance block on the monitor and you watch it as the number counts down from 4 digits to 3 digits. Half way. ""A little more than half way since I'm not counting the sprint as part of the piece""

Your quadraceps are on fire at this point. Doesn't take much imagination to picture each muscle fibre glowing red like the heating element of an electric stove. ""Only 100 more strokes"" you hear your coxswain tell you... that doesn't really help.

Your split is slipping again... seeing more 1:36's than 1:35's in there. You think to yourself, you count 2 strokes and then count out the next 10 strokes in your head and concentrate on just telling your legs to push. ""One.... Two... Three.... Four.... "" looking at the split and seeing you are back in control. You also notice that your rate has popped up to about 30. Your coxswain is saying something but you don't hear him and keep counting to yourself, ""Five.... SIx.... Seven... Eight.... Nine... Ten..."" You are back at 1:34 and have just crossed the 500m to go mark. 

""25 more strokes before my sprint!"" Trying to stay in control and counting 10 strokes, ""GO NOW!"". In the span of a single stroke you move from 30 strokes per minute to 45. Your see the split drop to 1:30, then to 1:29, then the sweat in your eyes gets so bad you close them. You can hardly breathe, but you are still counting out each stroke. After ten of them you manage to open your eyes and see that you have 212 meters to go and your split is a 1:28 you count out another 10. You feel like your legs are not liking you. Your peek reveals that your split has slipped to a 1:31 and all you can make out is the 1 followed by 2 other changing digits in the distance block. ""Another 20 strokes should do it"" you tell yourself, and proceed to count out another 10 and then another. On the second you are squinting your eyes, looking at the distance block and then numbers changing. When you reach stroke 10, so you count out your last three strokes,,False

*Written by WSU coxswain Erin Walker

There are none in this world who can understand the glory of crew except those who have done it.  There is something unimaginable in the sport of rowing - it cannot be described, shared only with eight other teammates, the rising sun, and the silence.  There is something about the repetition of the stroke; catch, pull through, release - that exposes the mind to a higher level of placidity found nowhere else.

There is something about pushing yourself farther than you can go, exhilaration during the sprint, fear at the necessity of another PR, sadness at the loss of oarsmen, frustration at every obstacle that rears itself.  In no other sport is such a chaotic control present.  Quick hands, quick body, slow slide; all eight oars in at the perfect time.

In no other sport is the word TEAM so meaningful as in crew.  Together in a shell, six to five...all the way to the bow.  One rower's demon haunts the entire boat; perfection in one oarsman means nothing.  A set boat and solid row is achieved solely when eight minds think identically, eight bodies melt together to form one machine.

One mistake can cost a race; one stray thought from the goal can cause a dream to die.  Yet somehow, only to become a challenge again the next day.  Never are you the best; never are you the worst.  We are all floating somewhere in the middle fighting to take the number one slot at any given time.

You see, to have nothing left.  It's about supporting your teammates, pulling for them when you have all but lost faith in yourself.  Crew is a sport that demands all of these things.  It is not a sport of fame; it is not a sport of popularity.  Rowing is above all that.  Rowing is a sport of purity and strength, constantly made better by you and I.",,False,self,False,t3_196qu8

1344103403.0,xofva,Regarding all of the posts about starting rowing,Casemander,60,3,35,"There have been a lot of questions lately in this subreddit about whether or not some people should start rowing. I'm by no means an expert on the sport

First and foremost, and if you're thinking of picking up a sport for money and fame, this isn't it. On the flip side of this, however, is an incredible community of athletes, coaches, and supporters, coaches might spend the mornings with Elites, a three time World Champion

**What can I expect from the sport?**

A lot of hard work. Especially in the winter / off water months, other forms of cardio, and maybe some technique work in rowing tanks. In the spring, summer, and fall, you'll be on the water as much as possible. Speaking as an American rower, the fall season is a few head-style races (kind of similar to a cross country race) that are about 5 kilometers long; it's a season for building endurance, and some strength. The winter will be about gearing up for the spring sprint season, high school races are 1500m).

**Am I too young/old/short/tall/fat/skinny/etc. to row?**

NO. Anyone telling you otherwise is a liar and a scoundrel. People seem to think that if you're under 6'8'' and 220 lbs. of pure muscle there's no way you can row competitively. Jason Reed is small by heavyweight rowing standards, in a sport dominated by guys who are 6'2'' and above. Greg Searle retired for *nine years* before picking up the sport again, and he just won a bronze medal in GB's 8+. Steve Redgrave won five gold medals at as many Olympiads, retiring at the ripe old age of 38. What these athletes share is more than talent: it's grit and determination. If you want it, go for it. And if you really, truly, are terrible? Well, and on top of that you've met an incredible group of friends who you will be close with for a very long time, if you're interested in rowing

**But everyone at the club is going to be better than me! I'm a freshman in college

Actually, from a U.S. standpoint) start their careers in college. It's like poker, sort of: it takes five minutes to learn, but a lifetime to master. A rowing stroke is pretty simple: you catch, drive, and recover. That's it. In the bigger boats, you even have someone to tell you what to do, but it's certainly not a prerequisite. You'd be surprised; talk to a coach. Above all

**But I don't want to be a burden on the team- I did a 500m test

If you want to row, most rowers, and all coaches I've met respect how difficult this sport is for everyone, and how everyone's goals and achievements are different. It's about winning and being the best you can be *first*; the gold comes later.

Anyway

Most of us take for granted our access to coaching, but rowers in some places aren't so lucky. Gerald is in Uganda, his erg has no monitor and he coached himself using YouTube videos. Despite this, he was able to qualify for the 2013 World Rowing Championship, which is pretty cool. At the championships, however, he's competing against teams with a lot more money and access to top notch coaching staff

A rowing non-profit called ""It's Bigger Than You"" has an indiegogo campaign to raise $5

The goal is to give Gerald a more level playing field; to ensure that he has the opportunity to perform his best at the competition and to focus the race on athleticism

1365608779.0,1c2hbv,"Last 2k test before championships, big improvement. What I did differently.",last500,38,2,http://www.reddit.com/r/Rowing/comments/1c2hbv/last_2k_test_before_championships_big_improvement/

Really happy with how this went. It was a big jump off my [previous one](http://www.reddit.com/r/Rowing/comments/191cbn/nice_way_to_kick_off_the_weekend/). I changed up a few things for this test and I thought I'd share some elements of my prep and strategy in case anyone can benefit from it.

**Caffeine**: I first did this in [January](http://www.reddit.com/r/Rowing/comments/179tv9/caffeine_and_testing_a_report/). I took about 345 mg of caffeine 60 minutes before the start of my test

**Lactate**: after trying this a couple races ago I decided to try it for the test. 4 [sportlegs](http://www.sportlegs.com/what/what.asp) supplements an hour beforehand. I can't tell if it made a difference or not during the test but my legs did seem to hurt a lot less than normal a few hours afterwards.

**Decongestant**: for whatever reason I've had a lot of problems with nasal and sinus congestion this year and have had trouble managing it. Especially with pre-race nerves and dry mouth from caffeine

*Edit to clarify: all supplements I took were legal

**Warmup**: I've used [this strategy](http://athletesbooks.com/how-to-do-a-great-2k-erg-test/) with success in the past. I broke a good sweat over the course of the warmup and felt very energized and ready to go. My only modification from previous times was that I removed all static stretching from my warmup after reading that it harms your performance.

**Test Strategy**: followed the test guidelines in the warmup strategy and executed it exactly how I planned.

*Start*: 3 quick strokes

*Base*: On my previous test I based around 1:34-1:35 at 33spm. I had a lot of energy left for the sprint which to me meant that I could have gone harder through the middle. Goal for today was 1:32-1:33 at 34spm. As far as I know it's most effective to hold consistently and not take any power moves through the middle

*Sprint*: At 300 to go I shifted up but I was in a lot of pain. It was everything I could do to bring the rate up just 1 beat and didn't drop my split very much. At 200 I let loose but my quads and hamstrings were starting to give out. I was holding about a 38 and technique went out the window

**Psychology**: Admittedly I wasn't feeling on top of my game mentally. I had a pretty busy and stressful week beforehand, that all evaporated once I got to practice and started warming up. I listened to my normal pump-up playlist and was feeling pretty good at the start. During the piece I distinctly remember thinking to myself ""I've got this, I'm going to do it"" about 800 in.

**Results**:
http://i.imgur.com/RKAraQB.jpg

I'm 20, a big jump from my 34.6 last time.

**Looking forward**:
I still have a lot of room to improve on my sleep habits and could do better with my pre-race nutrition. My supplement strategy worked very well

As for the test itself, possibly trying to max it out at a 36 through the whole base next time. I'm going to add more short to medium interval sprint workouts and start to get comfortable working below 1:30 for extended periods and repeated intervals. I also will continue to work on my sprint to be more effective with bringing the rate up and continuing to apply power through the line. In particular I want to work on holding that last 100 and develop the habit of shortening up and making a final push in around 20m to go to run out the clock. Every tenth counts and I don't want to lose any time in the future in the last 10-20m.",,False,self,t5_2qljq,1365693062.0,,

I can understand tapering to put in your very best time like at a CRASH-B but going into an event you should already know your approximate finish time so you can properly pace

I'm pretty new to Reddit

This was my first feature film, and produced the movie.  It has been receiving mixed reviews so far, so I thought I would come to the Reddit community for some honest feedback.  

I was a rower in high school and college and think that rowing is a beautiful sport.  I tried to make the movie as authentic as possible.  

I'll answer questions for the next couple hours while I am still in Boston waiting for my plane back to NYC.

Our 4 was doing a 12 minute piece, and then the guy behind me's oar came out of the lock. I'm guessing he didn't tighten it enough.

We were in a bow loader and our cox decided to jump out when we were tipping a bit. Bad idea? Of course.

Anyway

The temperature outside: 26 degrees Fahrenheit. We got back to the boathouse which luckily had hot showers and our entire crew ready to help us out. This was about an hour and a half ago. We're all fine

So the lesson is to always check the hardware before you row

This pretty much applies to every rower.  You are not a special snowflake... unless you row adaptive... then you won't be doing a 2K anyways.

**What are the standards*

Look on the sidebar under 'Erg Times' - there are two great documents with erg scores for all weight classes

**What split should I pull*

I see this question way too much so I am going to give you a ""secret"" (protip: it's not) workout to do 2-3 days before your erg test.  I've done it

* 6x500m with 2-3' rest (no more).

Go as hard as you can.  The average of these 6 pieces is a good aproximator of what you can pull during your erg test.  

Make sure you do a light steady state workout between these and your erg test.  It is not advised to do it the day before

**What's a good race plan**

A nice simple plan

* Sprint your first 100-150m
* Settle to your split average
* Keep rowing
* With ~300m to go (aka 1 minute) start bringing your split down and start your sprint.  You can do anything for 1 minute.

**How do I train to get better at them**

* Lots and lots of volume (steady states)
* Good sleep and recovery
* More volume
* good nutrition
* more volume",self,t5_2qljq,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/Rowing/comments/13koqz/the_great_2k_thread/

Now

Bob is trying to row for the U.S. Naval Academy. His father had told our coach that and also told our coach that he thinks his son should be at stroke seat. Well, while Bob is 5'10"". Jacob is pulling a significantly faster 2k than Bob and can row 2x as good as he can. We do our first piece with Bob and it is complete SHIT. We went from great keel to chimpanzees holding oars. There is no length and we are much, much slower than what we used to be.

This is where the politics come in.

Our coach finds it to be just fine and sends us to the regatta for the weekend. The boats we were beating by at least 2 lengths were holding us off for the entire race. It was ridiculous. 

I get home from the regatta and I talk to my parents who had been standing with the rest of the teams parents at the stands. They had heard Bobs dad talking about how great the boat looked compared to other regattas now that his son is stroking and that 2 seat is out of the boat. By the way Bob and his father acts

TL;DR: Rowers father is screwing the rest of my boat just to benefit his son by brown nosing our coach.

A preliminary FAQ is up and running.  It covers many of the questions frequently asked by novices.  I have additional sections for Intermediate  and Collegiate rowers which will go live *tomorrow* after I catch up on my bar review course materials after court this afternoon.  In addition, a more comprehensive section on diet, and a section on coaching that will go live *Tuesday* after my final court hearing.  These sections are geared mainly towards people training on their own or coaching smaller programs without any previous guidance -- I wouldn't tell another coach how to run his shop.  Sections on Coxing and Rigging will go up next *Wednesday* or *Thursday* after I move into my new apartment and get settled.

Thanks for your help.  If you have any suggestions, please offer them in this thread -- I'd be happy to respond and hear feedback.

Hello fellow Rowdittors

I am an 18 yo rower from Sherbrooke, rowing and dragon boat. 

Our club is also really poor and has really shitty equipment. Our rowing division has a handful of singles and novice singles

Our club currently pariticipates in a contest set up by Aviva Insurance, 2 doubles, singles and a new quad. It would also mean a new dragon boat and a bunch of canoes and kayaks for the other divisions.

The contest is some kind of popularity contest

To get to the finals
