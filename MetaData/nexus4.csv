[3] (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.rerware.android.MyBackup&amp;hl=en)  

* Installing a custom recovery or custom ROM will prevent you from receiving OTA (over the air) updates.  There is an alternative for those who ONLY wish to root but do not wish to load custom ROMs and still want to receive OTA updates. **If you wish to receive OTA updates

* **THIS *MAY* ALSO VOID YOUR MANUFACTURER WARRANTY (DEPENDING ON YOUR COUNTRY'S LAWS)


-----  
-----  
-----  

**PRELIMINARY STEP 1**

**1)** Plug your device into your computer with the USB cable

* If the USB drivers are already installed your device will pop up and you're ready for the next step

**PRELIMINARY STEP 2**

**2)**Enable **USB debugging** in *Settings --&gt; Developer Options*. (If you do NOT see a ""Developer Options"" in Settings, and tap on the **""Build Number""** section **7 times**. A pop-up should show telling you that you are ""now a developer."" Yay!)  

* Wait for the appropriate drivers to install and you're ready to move to Part 1

**===If your computer does not automatically install the drivers

3)

* Download the [**LG Nexus 4 USB Driver**](http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=1992345)  

* Follow the instructions in the above guide.  

OR  

3a)  

* Download the drivers by installing the desktop client for [PDANet for Android] (http://junefabrics.com/android/).  
* Once the program is installed

Some people have had trouble getting the USB drivers to install

With that in mind, hopefully this'll answer some questions.  

---**Do I want to root?**---  

Totally up to you. Rooting and/or Installing a new ROM can bring with it tons of customization features at the system level that cannot be replicated through apps such as nav bar customization and status bar customization. Installing new ROMs and/or kernels can also fix nasty bugs that otherwise won't get around to your device until the next Android update, or in the case of kernels you might sacrifice a bit of smoothness in favor of that better battery life. In my opinion, the benefits outweigh the negatives, but it's definitely not for everybody.

---**How do I root my phone?**---  


With a Nexus device

You have the option to use a toolkit to do it automatically

[Automatically with the Nexus 4 Toolkit] (http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=1995688).  

[Automatically with the Nexus General Toolkit by Wugfresh.] (http://www.wugfresh.com/nrt/)  

[Manually through adb using my guide] (http://www.reddit.com/r/nexus4/comments/14kghb/how_to_unlockroot_your_nexus_4_with_adb_a/#linkt) or any other guide/how-to you can find on XDA.  

---**What can I do once I'm rooted?**---  

[Here is an index] (http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=1975842#link) of nearly all the kernels, etc. that you can play around with. It seems daunting, I know, but there's just so much options available it's difficult to summarize each and every one.  

As for kernels, but I'm going to edit in all the new changes that devs have gotten around to).

If you have a Nexus 4


**Root Toolkit**  

**4.2.2**  

My phone is unlocked and rooted, just be unlocked, but if you're going to unlock it you might as well root it.  I used the [Nexus 4 toolkit](http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=1995688) to unlock and root.  WARNING:  this is going to wipe your phone!  You can use the toolkit to back it up first, but it's going to get reset.  

**4.3**  

The toolkit will not root an OTA 4.3 install

Download [the 4.3 factory image](https://developers.google.com/android/nexus/images?hl=pt-BR#occamjwr66v) and unzip the .tar file using [7-Zip](http://www.7-zip.org/).  
Unzip image-occam-jwr66v.zip.  
Copy the system.img and boot.img files into the put_img_files_to_flash_here folder in your Nexus 4 Toolkit folder.  
Plug your phone into your computer and open up the toolkit and select option 13 for the 4.2.2 build.  
Select option 11 to flash an image to the device.  
Type system.img and then select #2 to Flash
Type N to have the toolkit boot into fastboot mode and flash the image.  

Do it again for the boot.img file


**The Files and Flashing**  

**4.2.2**  

You're going to need to flash three files, an audio fix for that radio, and the necessary build.prop instructions to identify your phone as an LTE phone.  (/u/Panaka explained pretty well [in this comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/nexus4/comments/1i44br/now_with_the_tmobile_rollout_will_they_bring_back/cb0thjf) why it's necessary to use an older radio version.)  Download this [All-in-one .zip](https://sites.google.com/site/bpearuploads/) to your phone and remember where you put it.  (The default location is going to be in the Downloads folder.)

Many ROMs already have an older radio version and/or won't need the audio fix when rolling back the radio.  If you want to get the necessary zip files seperately then you can get the [radio](http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=2087227)

Now either boot into recovery or use something like [ROM Manager](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.koushikdutta.rommanager&amp;feature=nav_result#?t=W251bGwsMSwyLDNd) or [GooManager](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.s0up.goomanager&amp;feature=nav_result#?t=W251bGwsMSwyLDNd) to flash the zip file.  Whichever way you go

**4.3**  

Download [TWRP recovery](http://goo.im/devs/OpenRecovery/mako/openrecovery-twrp-2.6.0.0-mako.img) and put it in the toolkit images folder talked about in the 4.3 section above.  
Download [SuperSU 1.43](http://download.chainfire.eu/342/SuperSU/UPDATE-SuperSU-v1.43.zip) and the [Hybrid 0.33/0.84 All-in-one .zip](http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=2358931) and put them in the toolkit zip_file_to_sideload folder.  
Using the toolkit
From the main menu in the toolkit
Once that's done repeat it to flash the All-in-one .zip.  
Reboot the phone and unplug it from your computer.  


**APN Settings**  

**4.2.2 and 4.3**

Now you need to either change your APN or make a new one.  To get there go to Settings&gt;More...&gt;Mobile networks&gt;Access Point Names.  These are the settings you're going to want:  


Name: T-Mobile US LTE  

APN: fast.t-mobile.com  

MMSC: http://mms.msg.eng.t-mobile.com/mms/wapenc  

MCC: 310  

MNC: 260  

APN type: default

APN protocol: IPv4/IPv6  

At first I couldn't get LTE to work and had to spend 20+ minutes troubleshooting it before I realized that I'd missed the ""-"" in ""fast.t-mobile.com"".  Trust me when I say that that dash is important.  And don't forget to save the changes.  


**Phone Menu**  

**4.2.2**

Now go to your dialer and dial * # * # 4636 # * # *  and a menu will pop up.  Go to Phone Information and scroll down to ""Set preferred network type"".  It's just above the ""Turn off radio"" button.  Change it to ""LTE/GSM/CDMA auto (PRL)"" or any of the LTE options.  And Voila!  Now you should have LTE data!

-----  
---**What IS a kernel?**---  

* The ELI5 answer: ""An analogy: the Kernel is like the Engine
 
In other words

-----  

---**The Stock Kernel**---  

The ""stock"" kernel is the kernel that comes with your Nexus 4 out of the box. It's compiled directly from Google's kernel source code and shipped on your device with zero modifications. A custom kernel

**What are those modifications that kernel devs employ?**  

To understand what they mean

*What are the stock kernel parameters?*  
&gt;CPU min frequency: 384 MHz  
&gt;CPU max frequency: 1512 MHz  
&gt;Governor: Ondemand  
&gt;I/O Scheduler: CFQ  

*What does each parameter represent?*  

* CPU frequency: you can simply think of this as the ""speed"" the CPU is running at  
* Governor: regulates the CPU frequency based on many different parameters such as load and time-in-state. [Here is an excellent list] (http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=1369817) of many of the most common CPU governors and how each works. Note that you will only see a couple of the CPU governors on this list in whatever kernel you use. Ondemand and Interactive are by far the most widely used
* I/O Scheduler: handles how the system makes disk access; Please refer to the previous linked thread and scroll down to the 4th post for a detailed list.  

**What else do you need to know?**  

--*PowerHAL*--    
&gt;PowerHAL is what makes Project Butter. The powerHAL is a ROM component that tells the kernel to BOOST the CPU frequency to higher values in response to UI inputs. The higher CPU frequencies can better respond to UI demands so the overall experience is smoother than without. - faux123  

--*mpdecision*--   

&gt;All Qualcomm based phones have Qualcomm prorprietary userspace binary called ""mpdecision"" aka m(ake)p(oor)decision. Instead of letting the kernel itself to decide what frequencies and how many cores to run

ELI5: mpdecision is a proprietary Qualcomm daemon that makes calls to the SoC (the entire chip your phone uses) to manage the cores. The OS (PowerHAL) makes a request to mpdecision and then mpdecision makes a request to the first two cores to ramp them up. - _motley  

*Why do kernel devs mess with these?*  

In practice, rather than waiting for the kernel to calculate the load and ramp up accordingly. On the Nexus 4, when the PowerHAL makes a call to mpdecision it locks the minimum CPU to 1026 MHz upon touch input for the first two cores. While this DOES give you the buttery-smoothness you would expect, it's a bit overly aggressive. This is part of the reason why stock kernel tends to heat up your phone when you play around with it a lot.  

-----  

---**Custom Kernels**---  

**What changes should I look out for?**  

--*mpdecision*--  

Many kernel devs don't like Qualcomm's implementation, Bricked, Matr1x, Motley, and Trinity have gotten rid of it/used their own implementations. Harsh and IntersectRaven's leave it intact. Every kernel dev implements things in their own way, and the only way to tell which is better for you is to try each one. This is by far the biggest change any kernel dev can make, as it completely alters how the system handles hotplugging and CPU scaling. In general, with greater battery life

--*thermald*--  

A binary that controls how to throttle your CPU based on CPU and battery temperatures. You can find the config file in /system/etc/thermald.conf. Stock configs lead to aggressive thermal throttling (battery temp. at 36 degrees C for example, or to further make your phone run cooler.  

--*Underclocking*--  

Quite straightforward
P = C(V\^2)f where C is capacitance
..gives you an idea of how underclocking (and undervolting) uses less power.    

--*Undervolting*--  

This is all the rage today, which is likely where you've felt the heat before. How much your chip can successfully undervolt [depends on what type of binned CPU you have] (http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=2052496). If you want to undervolt, I recommend checking if the voltages you set are stable by [running the StabilityTest app] (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.into.stability&amp;hl=en) and doing the Scaling Stability Test. The frequencies' voltages definitely don't scale linearly, so don't assume that doing global undervolts will be the best you can do. You'll have to apply voltages one by one if you truly want the lowest your chip can possible handle.  

--*Overclocking/overvolting*--  

Bricked, because it CAN be dangerous. Overclocking usually requires overvolting the processor (so the overclock is stable) but overvolting carries with it the risk of bricking your phone by frying the CPU. Know that doing this has some risks before you try it. Some kernels like Matr1x and Faux's also allow for the GPU to be overclocked if games run a little slowly for you.  

--*Hotplugging*--  

Hotplugging is where the individual cores on your phone switch on/off depending on the load on the CPU. The advantage of hotplugging is a reduction in power used because the cores will only turn on when needed. Kernels that use the auto_hotplug binary by Thalamus (that would be Matr1x, Bricked at the moment) allow you to fine tune the enabling and disabling thresholds. These parameters are generally for advanced users only as they require you to write scripts to control them.  

--*Color Control*--  

Gives you the ability to change color multipliers and gamma settings to calibrate your display. If you feel your display is too yellow
  
--*Wakelock reduction*-- 

Some kernels have reduced the msm_hsic_host wakelock duration so your phone enters deep sleep more often. How much improvement this makes is debatable

--*Kernel modules*--  

Some kernels make modifications to the low-level drivers that interact with the components of your phone. [An explanation of what is commonly touched can be found here.] (http://forum.xda-developers.com/showpost.php?p=22134559&amp;postcount=3) You don't really have to worry about this

-----  
---**Installing a Custom Kernel**---  

Just flash the zip in your recovery of choice. No need for wiping cache or anything. However, you are writing to the entire boot partition. The boot partition is made up of the kernel AND the ramdisk (the ramdisk is an image that the kernel mounts read-only at boot, it is basically used by the kernel to mount the rest of the system images). Some kernel devs pack their own ramdisk into their boot.img that you are flashing, so when you try to flash a DIFFERENT kernel, you end up in a bootloop. (An example: flash Franco kernel --&gt; flash Faux kernel on top = bootloop.) To solve this you need to reset the ramdisk by flashing a [stock reset kernel with the stock ramdisk] (http://forum.xda-developers.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=1550949&amp;d=1355107145).

Here goes:

* **REV 10** - AFAIK
* **REV 11** - According to [this](http://celltraderonline.com/showthread.php?4253-Knowing-The-Difference-Nexus-4-REV-10-Vs-Nexus-4-REV-11), and the screen is more on the yellow side, while the original was ""whiter"". REV 11 is also 6 grams lighter than REV 10, which came in at 140 grams. *Update &amp; Edit: Based on the below comments/feedback, it would appear that some REV 11 models also have the ""Nipples"". That's news to me.*
* **REV 12** - This is the version that [added little nubs / ""nipples""](http://www.androidpolice.com/2013/03/28/did-google-and-lg-silently-and-subtly-update-the-nexus-4s-design/) to the bottom of the phone's back side in order to raise it off of flat surface
* **REV 13** - Appears to be nearly identical to REV 12. If you now what changed

*Note: Each revision is sometimes listed slightly differently as rev_1x, Revision 1x, where x is the current number.*

Received today

I came from an iPhone 4s and I gotta say, but if you've used an iPhone with a case for any amount of time, this phone feels right at home in your hands. 

The weight of this phone actually feels a tad bit lighter than my 4s does. The thickness is about the same and the build quality of this phone is top notch. Powering it on was a dream to see. The display is so crisp and clean

Setup was super fast. I logged in using the same Google account I've got setup for my nexus 7 and it hurried away to try to start installing everything I had on my tablet. I had to rush to go stop those downloads

As far as battery is concerned, using it as I normally would. Its early, but I could easily see the battery lasting me a full day with about 20% to spare by evening plugin time.

As for performance, I had pretty much already forgotten about it.

Multitasking is really nice and quick

I checked out the camera function and noticed that photosphere wasn't there yet. Had an update waiting for me and proceeded to install. Everything was in place after that.

Speaking of installs, and slow down performance of the play store whilst doing it. Not so on the Nexus 4. She started flying and I went off browsing other apps with no noticeable slow down at all. All apps were updated within 30 seconds tops.


There are a few things I'm trying to figure out that don't quite make sense with 4.2. 

The lock screen widgets are a nice touch, the unlock slide can go in any direction now. Was only to the right on my nexus 7.

With lock screen widgets installed, instead of a lock circle icon.


Also, its actually very well done. The typing is very fast and predictions are spot on. I've been typing this whole body of text on it and haven't had the need to stop and back up and rewrite everything 5 times as I was getting with the older keyboard. The new swipe style keyboard just works out of the box with no real need to configure. I figured it would be pretty hard to use, but its amazingly gratifying and easy to type out large amounts of text with just a thumb or index finger.

Overall I'm quite blown away by this phone and pleased to make the switch from iOS land to this phone.

I'm sorry for everyone's issues not receiving their phones or even being able to order

I'd be happy to answer anyone's questions here. Feel free to ask away.




EDIT 1: I've taken some makeshift photo quality tests between my iPhone 4s and the Nexus 4. Here are the results in medium to low light..  http://imgur.com/a/fDQuh

ALSO: I came from an AT&amp;T iPhone Microsim. I got a test MicroSim from T-Mobile in my area to test their coverage

iPhone on AT&amp;T : Full Bars - 3G status - 99ping - 1150kbps download - 146kbps upload

Nexus 4 on T-Mobile : 2-3 bars - 3G and sometimes H - 1434ping - 10945kbps Download - 1346kbps Upload

Nexus 4 on the same AT&amp;T plan and Microsim as the iPhone - Full Bars H - 87ping - 12376kbps Download - 1108kbps Upload

So it looks like my old iphone wasn't making the most of the data available.  

I also did some preliminary WiFi tests

iphone would constantly get around 25-30Mbps up and down

Nexus 4 gets well over 40Mbps constantly.

quality antennae for the win!

A good phone shouldn't need maintenance/administration for it to work well and work properly. In my case, they don't care to have to maintain their phone. So, it gets annoying when ""root it"" is the answer to every damn fuckin question.

* Wanting to remove OEM skin or removing junk apps (if poster says they are not happy with using a different launcher and just disabling the bloatware apps in settings).
* Wanting to selectively give apps permissions.

I've owned a few phones throughout the years. I started with the HTC Droid Eris
I grew frustrated with my phones getting left behind

It's a straight up premium phone.

*Appearance and feel:* It's light, buisness-like shimmer. Like a leather couch in your hand.
The Galaxy Nexus had a tendency to feel loose and frail

My side buttons are weird, or the design, but it makes a difference.


*Display:* It's boss. The Galaxy Nexus had an awesome screen
Surprisingly enough, the blacks are black enough to blend with the bezel as well as before.

I think it's fair to say that iPhones have some of the best displays around, but I think it's just that - a different temperature. I like it, but it didn't take much to simply change values around to match iPhone levels of saturation.


*Performance*: Holy balls. I thought the GNex was fast. What's there to say, Max Payne, GTA III, Dead Trigger all run fantastically on the highest settings.

Oh, but it's unpleasant and it's noticeable. Compare this to an iPhone 5 which performs the same tasks with equal performance, but remains pleasantly at a cool-to-room temperature.


*Battery*: I'm still doing unscientific tests with kernels, and I browse the web lots. I have to re-charge it by early evening, but I try not to let it drop below 10% battery.

It's not a comfortable amount of battery

**How do I save $1

For the uninitiated, etc.).  They negotiate wholesale rates, and then they chop up that capacity and resell it to consumers.  In other word's they're a middle man... they don't own a network, or towers... they don't build infrastructure.  They just repackage the capacity, and pass cost savings on to end-users.  And yes... believe it or not, it's actually a thing.

**And this saves me money?**

You've probably seen the ads for pre-paid wireless... be it [Straight Talk]( http://straighttalk.com), right?   There's got to be some catch... because who in their right might would pay double that for their AT&amp;T contract?  Well, by the numbers the vast majority do.  In fact, despite trailing Verizon by 20 million wireless subscribers in Q1, 2013... AT&amp;T is expected to add another 475,000 new customers this quarter!  What's that worth?  Well, it's worth more than $38 million per month to them!  Why?  simply because most people won't consider a pre-paid option

**Yes

Good question - and there are some caveat's if you read Straight Talk's terms and conditions.  The one that has the potential to impact most folks is the ""unlimited"" [web-browsing]( http://addicted-to-it.blogspot.com/2013/02/nexus-4-straight-talk-part-4-data-usage.html)... which is in fact, and you should pay attention to your data usage.  At the risk of oversimplifying... unlimited web-browsing translates into ""don't abuse your data plan""...   which if you're looking for a real-world guideline actually means... keep it to 2GB per month, or not much more than 100mb on any given day.  So the next question many folks ask, is *""Is that alot""*, or *""What's typical?""*.  Most customers on either AT&amp;T or T-Mobile don't reach a 2GB per month.  And [only 4% of AT&amp;T customers use more than 3GB]( http://www.fiercewireless.com/story/unlimited-unnecessary-npd-report-finds-average-smartphone-data-use-below-2/2012-08-24).   The story might be a little dated, so I also conduced an unscientific survey of folks working in a technology company... all had Smart Phones, and all were in the age range of 28- 40 years of age.  Guess what they used?  The average range was between 700MB - 1.2GB per month.

**What does this have to do with a Nexus 4?**

Google's Nexus 4 is a carrier unlocked GSM phone.  If you're [here]( http://www.reddit.com/r/nexus4), unlike the Galaxy SIII, the Nexus 4 does not have a Super AMOLED display.  Since the Nexus 4 is manufactured by the king of LCD production, LG has managed to squeeze every lost drop of LCD goodness out of the aging technology (while yields are still ramping up on the OLED manufacturing).  For those unfamiliar with [GSM]( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GSM ) it means that the phone will work darn near anywhere on earth that has a cell phone carrier, and all you need to do is grab a prepaid SIM card on a local carrier's network.  Prepaid SIM cards are common just about everywhere in the world, expect for the US (though via MVNO's, they're becoming more common).  *So in the United States, it's now [illegal]( http://www.tuaw.com/2013/01/25/unauthorized-unlocking-of-new-phones-to-be-illegal-in-u-s/) to unlock a locked phone without the carrier's permission.  Crazy, or perhaps at a [loss]( http://www.techradar.com/us/reviews/phones/mobile-phones/google-nexus-4-1108999/review)

**What does YOUR contract cost?**

I hate spending money on things that I don't need, I was amazed... my bill was about $45 a month through Sprint.  Given inflation, it must have gone up... so factoring 3% annual inflation, my bill should on the order of $61 a month.  But no, my bill was about $90 per month, and when I add a second line, data,000 a year for my mobile communication ""needs"".  Now, and in the intervening decades I've stacked up monthly-recurring cost  upon cost... cable, Netflix

**So what's the plan?**

As you may have figured out by now,000 per year by doing so.  With both of those steps having been completed, and a month or two having passed, I've started to [get a sense]( http://addicted-to-it.blogspot.com/2013/02/nexus-4-straight-talk-part-3-month-in.html) of what it's like being on a pre-paid plan.

**So how does Straight Talk work

Remember how I said Straight Talk is a mobile virtual network operator (MVNO), then you have an unlocked GSM phone already.  And that means you just need to pick-up a Straight Talk SIM card... either an AT&amp;T Compatible SIM Card, or a T-Mobile Compatible SIM card - either will work in your Nexus 4.  For me, I know I have good AT&amp;T coverage - because I was an AT&amp;T customer for more than 5 years.  When I went over to Straight Talk, I chose an AT&amp;T Compatible Card.  In other words, my  Straight Talk coverage is the same coverage I'd get on AT&amp;T.  So when I'm on the road, I have the same great coverage in most places (and the exact same dead spots as I did before).  Oh, you might have read that there's no roaming.  Which is true

**This sounds complicated.**  

You know what, or that I couldn't afford an unsubsidized new phone.  I just thought it wasn't worth the irritation.  The reality?  I'm saving [at least $829 per year]( http://addicted-to-it.blogspot.com/2013/02/nexus-4-straight-talk-part-3-month-in.html) on Straight Talk over my prior AT&amp;T plan, and I use my phone more than I used to.

**Okay fine - maybe it's not too complicated

No... in fact, there are penalties for being irresponsible with your [data usage]( http://addicted-to-it.blogspot.com/2013/02/nexus-4-straight-talk-part-4-data-usage.html), but as I mentioned... the vast majority of folks don't use even 2GB of data per month.  If you don't know how much data you're using, and have a Nexus 4... click Settings&gt;Data Usage... and check your data usage and the break-down by application.  Go back a few months as well... more than 2GB per month?  Probably not.  If you're on AT&amp;T or T-Mobile, you can also check the web-site and see what you've been using.  

**Where are the correct APN settings?**

Straight Talk keeps the APN settings [here](http://www.straighttalksim.com/support.php).  But here's a quick-reference:

Name: Straight Talk, Port: 80, Username: Not set, Password: Not set, Server: Not Set, MMSC: http://mmsc.cingular.com, MMS Proxy: 66.209.11.33, MCC: 310, APN roaming protocol: IPv4

**What's the verdit?**

I'm a couple months into the switch to Straight Talk on my Nexus 4, coverage, or are just looking for a quick-start read-on.

&gt;It is a guess... but a pretty informed guess. My brother has been a manager in shipping logistics for decades
&gt;
&gt;Google is not fulfilling these orders. They hired a subcontractor (UPS Logistics) to do it
&gt;
&gt;UPS received the product (in palettes) from the vendor (Korea),000 units, that manifest should have contained the first 50,000 orders. At that point, UPS breaks the palettes down and ships it all out as they see fit. This is where the logistics come in. The orders are filled based on destination and not FIFO. Whether you're shipped first or last is due simply to UPS' routing network and transportation management. UPS then sends fulfillment info back to Google for billing and customer notification. This is why some folks saw tracking straight from UPS (with MyChoice) before Google could relay it.
&gt;
&gt;Now as to why the first early orders (mine was at 08:33:53 PST) have seem to be universally in limbo... this is where Google may have sheet the bed, and their subcontractor went to work, they had no control over the fulfillment process. When you hire a roofer, and pick out such and such shingles, you can't just change your mind halfway thru the roofing job.
&gt;
&gt;There is nothing wrong with how they choose to do this. This kind of sub-contractor arrangement speeds getting thru customs as well as transportation time and lowers costs. But if Google botched the manifest

You can view the original post [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/nexus4/comments/14nyro/eli5_moving_from_sprint_to_tmobiles_nocontract/c7etyut) if you want to see the surrounding discussions

So, this will be your first prepaid phone. You now truly own *your* device, and the carriers are now courting *you*! You have many options at your disposal, such as [StraightTalk](http://www.straighttalk.com), [Net10](http://www.net10wireless.com/), [Solavei](http://www.solavei.com/), and our old friends, and [T-Mobile](http://prepaid-phones.t-mobile.com/prepaid-plans).

Since the biggest advantage of having carriers courting you is saving money, as I feel it offers the absolute cheapest and best 4G service for your money. I'm going to show you how to get unlimited voice, data, and text, for *less than* $30. Please note my guide is only meant as a ""quick start"" guide. There are much more in depth articles that you can use, and I will link them to you shortly. So let's get started!

First things first, and if you care about keeping your current number, [port it into Google Voice](http://support.google.com/voice/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;answer=1065667). This costs $20. If you don't care, just create a new Google Voice account - you're going to end up with two numbers, a carrier number and a GV number, but ideally you will only ever use your Google Voice number. This has *many* benefits, summarized [here in a flashy video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOZU7BOeQ58) and [here in text](http://www.google.com/googlevoice/about.html), not the least of which is the ability to use Google Voice as a seamless way to make calls over data.

*Some things to be aware of, but SMS may take several more hours or even a day or so. It all depends on your timing, what carrier you have, what plan/contract you have, etc.

The other one - *and this is a big one for some people* - is that Google Voice does NOT support MMS! You will be able to text and call, among other things, one of those abilities is automatic translation from an MMS to an e-mail. The message will arrive in your Gmail account with the picture attached.) *I do not personally find this to be a big deal.* The simple fact of the matter is that MMS is a dated, horrible way to transfer media - It squashes your pictures to tiny resolutions, it transcodes your audio to garbage, it generally ruins everything you send through it. It was built for a time when phones had 160x160 screens that barely qualified as ""color,"" and it's changed little ever since; it's really badly dated in a time when nearly everyone carries a high resolution, I simply use [Facebook Messenger](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.facebook.orca&amp;feature=nav_result#?t=W251bGwsMSwxLDMsImNvbS5mYWNlYm9vay5vcmNhIl0.), upload the image to [imgur](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.imgurforandroid&amp;feature=search_result) and simply paste the link over. For group messaging

Regardless of whether you port or not

You can look around online for a deal on a refill card (CallingMart used to offer them

Activate your phone using the normal instructions on the [T-Mobile website](http://prepaid-phones.t-mobile.com/prepaid-activate); you will need your SIM card info, you will have an account with something like $3 and change on it, but no service; you can either do a ""fund your account"" thing on the website and select the ""Redeem a refill card"" to enter a prepaid refill code, you can do the normal payment direct to T-Mobile.

Again on the ""if you want to, so it's a good deal for both of us.

Log into Google Voice and add this phone. Now, and you'll just get your voicemails through the Voice app. *The only thing this affects is when people call your carrier number* (which they won't be doing in this scenario) *they will get no voicemail at all.* Calls going to your GV number will work exactly like you'd expect; Voice will pick up just fine, they will leave their message, you'll get a notification from the Google Voice app (which also integrates directly into the dialer in Android 4.2, a nice touch! View Call history to play the voicemail that call left.)

While you've got T-Mobile on the phone, because we're all grown ass adults and can look at porn and guns and Facebook if we goddamn well want to (seriously, it blocks Facebook by default.)

Bam! You've got 4G service with unlimited texting, etc, for *less than* $30 every month! You can just stop here if 100 minutes is enough for you, or you can install Vonage and use that for outgoing calls to save some minutes there - Vonage is currently offering 3,000 minutes of outbound calling per month, just for installing their app.

Don't forget that if even, you can still just toss an extra $10 in there and you're *still going to save money* over any other carrier or plan; the cost over overage is $0.10 per minute.

But what if you need more? Well, which has a subscription based pricing structure to remove the ads, support multiple Google Voice accounts, and improve quality. How much improved quality? I don't know. But there's another option...

Is coverage really good in your area? Do you spend most of your time on WiFi? OK. To fix that low minute thing

The very first thing you'll need to do is get your contacts cleaned up for SIP dialing. SIP dialing demands that numbers be dialed in their *full international format.* You can use [Contact Cleanup](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.peterbaldwin.client.android.cleanup&amp;hl=en) to format your contact numbers properly in one click; select the +XXXXXXXXXXXX format (the very bottom option.) Android will space this back out to the more readable ""+XX XXX XXX XXXX"" format all on it's own.

Now, which will create a new Pbxes.org account and link it to Google Voice. If it's having trouble connecting, enable ICE and see if that helps (ICE allows it punch through firewalls better) and if not, look around for how to setup STUN server (Google ""public stun server"" if nothing else.) Once it's able to connect and register itself, you'll want to log into [Pbxes.org](https://www1.pbxes.com/index_e.php) and fill in the Personal Data section - **THIS IS IMPORTANT** - Pbxes.org will delete your account if you don't do so! The one other thing we want to do here is enable Call Waiting. To do that, click Extensions, select the ""SipDroid &lt;200&gt;"" extension, and finally

**A NOTE FOR PEOPLE USING TWO-FACTOR GOOGLE AUTHENTICATION**: You have to do another step here if you are using two-factor auth - Go to your [Google Application Specific Passwords](https://accounts.google.com/b/0/IssuedAuthSubTokens#accesscodes) and create a new password specifically for Pbxes.org. Copy the password, and select the Gtalk trunk. Here you need to enter the password given. Failure to add this will result in you being able to receive incoming calls, but no ability to make Outgoing.

I personally like CSipSimple a little bit more. To use that, and go back to the 'SipDroid &lt;200&gt;' extension. Click that and make a note of the username there - it will look like xxxxx-200. *Change the password to something you will remember!* Now go into CSipSimple, do the Add Account thing, go under ""World Wide Providers"" and select Pbxes.org. Enter the xxxxx-200 username and password (for your extension, NOT your Pbxes.org account!) and add it. It should register and then you're done. If CSipSimple will not register and just times out, try enabling ICE and/or setting up a STUN server (personally, just turning on ICE has worked for me almost everywhere.)

Now when you dial out you will get a prompt on whether you want to dial with CSipSimple or via your carrier. If you want a more streamlined method, and go to Filters. Go into Pbxes.org and add a filter for ""All."" Change the condition to ""Directly Call"" and set it to ""All."" Now go ino ""Use Mobile"", set it to ""Directly Call,"" and add a filter for ""Ends with +."" This way, when you hold zero before dialing a call with the native dialer, it will call over cellular. If you just dial the number with no + at the end, it will call over SIP. The last thing you want to do is exclude 911 - Set a filter under Use Mobile for Directly Call, 911.

To improve quality, verify your email, etc. After signing in, click the Products link, then select ""Free Phone Number."" Go through the steps to find a New York number (only NY numbers are offered; this doesn't matter since we'll be using our Google Voice number.) When asked if you are going to be using the service within the US, select NO - this is for 911 Administrative Fees, and we will NOT be using this line for emergency services. After ""purchasing"" the free number, and select the DID Forwarding tab.) Here we will click the place where you can enter info

For codecs, in those order:

Fast Networks:

* PCMU 8KHZ
* ILBC 8KHZ
* speex 8KHZ
* GSM 8KHZ

Slow Networks:

* ILBC 8KHZ
* speex 8KHZ
* GSM 8KHZ

speex and GSM are included for fall-back negotiation only; ideally we only ever want to use PCMU or iLBC.

The last thing we need to do is set Google Voice to ring our CallCentric number instead of Google Talk or our cell phone. To do this, you'll get a call and your first sample of what voice quality will be like on SIP. Verify your number, then uncheck the boxes to forward to your carrier number as well as Google Talk.

Some tests you can do:

*43 (pbxes echo test)

(909) 390-0003 (PSTN echo test)

(408) 647-4636 (record/playback)

A tutorial aimed at those who know next to nothing.,IAmAN00bie,113,19,14,"**edit: I've updated the guide to reflect the latest factory image that was released (4.2.2) but the pictures remain the same. Literally the only difference are the filenames in the pictures

As requested, locking the bootloader, unrooting, and essentially turning it back to how it was when you first bought it.  

**This guide works on Windows

-----  
-----  
-----  

**ASSUMPTIONS**  

* You already have the correct drivers for your phone set up. If you do not

* You already have the Android SDK installed, at least) are on the previous guide!   

* You have an archive manager installed that can extract from a .tgz file. **I recommend either [7zip, which can be found here] (http://www.win-rar.com/download.html?&amp;L=0).** I believe OSX and definitely any Linux machine can do this out of the box, but if necessary these two programs run on both.  

-----  
-----  
-----  


**PART 1**

1) Download the Android Factory Image for the Nexus 4 [found here] (https://developers.google.com/android/nexus/images#occam). Note that as 
time passes and newer versions of Android are released

2) Locate the downloaded file  

* For example: occam-jdq39-factory-345dc199.tgz (at the time of this writing

3) Right click the file

3a) Extract the folder called  

&gt;occam-jdq39  

to your desktop (again: note that this folder may be called something different when a newer factory image is released)

4) Open the folder you made on your desktop

**Everything is now set up and you are ready to begin unrooting/relocking your phone!**

-----  
-----  
-----  


**PART 2**

1) Turn on USB Debugging on your phone (Settings --&gt; Developer Options --&gt; USB Debugging). (If you do NOT see a ""Developer Options"" in Settings, and tap on the ""Build Number"" section 7 times. A pop-up should show telling you that you are ""now a developer."" Yay!)  

2) Open the Android SDK/Platform-Tools folder  

2a) Press and hold **Shift** and **Right click**  

2b) Select “Open command window here”

3) In the command prompt

&gt;**adb reboot bootloader**  

-----
----**PICK 4a or 4b DEPENDING ON YOUR OS!**----  

-----

4a) **WINDOWS**: Once your phone reboots into the bootloader: type  

&gt;flash-all.bat  

4b) **LINUX/MAC**: Once your phone reboots into the bootloader: type  

&gt;flash-all.sh  


5) Your phone will reboot when this process is finished. This whole process may take a while so please be patient! 

6) Once your phone restarts and goes through the setup screens

7) Connect your phone. In the command prompt

&gt;**adb reboot bootloader**  

8) Once your phone boots into the bootloader

&gt;**fastboot oem lock**  

**Your phone is now unrooted and locked and back to it's factory state!** These steps can restore your phone if it won't boot up or a number of other issues.

1373658547.0,1i6ae0,A real step by step guide on how to enable LTE on the Nexus 4,Moonlitekilla,105,23,133,"So I wrote this for my father as he needs help with this stuff sometimes and I figured I'd share it. It is numbered and easy to read. 

**YOU MUST BE ROOTED IN ORDER TO DO THIS**  
**YOU DO NOT HAVE TO WIPE YOUR PHONE**

If you are not rooted then go to this link:

[Nexus 4 Toolkit on the XDA Forum](http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=1995688)

Here is a link to common terminology when it comes to rooting and flashing ROM's:

[Android ROM and rooting dictionary for beginners](http://www.talkandroid.com/guides/beginner/android-rom-and-rooting-dictionary-for-beginners/)

1. Get the .33 radio from [here](http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=2087227). You can do this from your phone or from your computer but if you do use the computer

2. Flash that file now by holding the power button down and restarting the phone in recovery. If you do not have that option

3. Once in recovery, navigate to where you saved the file on your phone and use the power button (or touch) to have the .zip flashed. The you can wipe both the caches (or not, I don't but when flashing a new ROM you should) and restart your phone. 

4. Download [Root Explorer](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.speedsoftware.rootexplorer&amp;feature=search_result#?t=W251bGwsMSwyLDEsImNvbS5zcGVlZHNvZnR3YXJlLnJvb3RleHBsb3JlciJd) or [Root Browser](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.jrummy.root.browserfree&amp;feature=search_result#?t=W251bGwsMSwxLDEsImNvbS5qcnVtbXkucm9vdC5icm93c2VyZnJlZSJd). RE costs a small amount but I like it more so to me it is worth it.

5. Copy this word for word (hold down on it until you have it selected. Use the blue bars to select it all. Press the button that looks like two pieces of paper in the upper right to copy):  
telephony.lteOnGsmDevice=1  
ro.telephony.default_network=9  
ro.ril.def.preferred.network=9   
**PLEASE NOTE** If you flash a new ROM you have to do this again for LTE to automatically be turned on after a regular reboot.  

6. Go into RE or RB and go up to the highest parent folder. Find the folder ""system"" and open it. Then find the file ""build.prop"" and hold down on it to open the options. Press ""Open in Text Editor"" to bring it up in a way you can edit it. 

7. Find the line ""telephony.lteOnCdmaDevice=0"" (should be closer to the bottom than the top) and it looks like [this](http://i.imgur.com/QxcrSkN.png)

8. Save it and make sure it stuck by rechecking the file and seeing those three lines. 

9. Go into your settings, then access point names. 

10. Edit the name to ""T-Mobile US LTE""
""fast.t-mobile.com"",admin,dun,mms"", and make sure both APN protocols are IPv4/IPv6. Screenshots of what it should look like:  
[Screen 1](http://i.imgur.com/eQo7Rxt.png)  
[Screen 2](http://i.imgur.com/O7OEAXY.png)  
Not on T-Mobile? [Here](http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=1434995) is a link for all the other APN's.  
[Here](http://forums.team-nocturnal.com/forum/nexus-development/nexus-4/nexus-4-general/1781-[apn]-nexus-4-mako-lte-apn-settings) is the APN for AT&amp;T LTE.  
If you find more
**NOTE**: As /u/JARofTAR has mentioned

11. MAKE SURE YOU SAVE IT by pressing the upper right settings button and pressing save.

12. Save [this](https://www.dropbox.com/s/ttfxcersckup8ml/cwm-mako-NoAudioFixForTMobileUSA.zip) to your phones memory. You have to reflash it every time you flash a new ROM as it is the ""No Audio Fix."" If you do not flash this then when you make calls you will have no audio.  

13. Flash that using the same method in steps two and three. 

14. After reboot you wont see 4G. You need to do the good ol from our Thunderbolt days  (star)#(star)#4636#(star)#(star), more (under wireless &amp; networks), mobile networks, Network mode, then selct ""LTE/GSM/WCDMA""

15. Go to your homescreen and [wait for iiiiiiiit](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=lwIxIjvvPBE#t=6s) ..... BOOM 4G LTE

Hope this helps! If I need to change anything
  
**If something wasn't clear

Have fun with LTE :)

**EDIT**: Added a bit more info on how to actually flash the ""No audio fix"" file and files in general.

~~Hey guys

~~My name's Zach, managed to smash the back glass on my Nexus 4. Frustrated at the price of replacement OEM glass which would just break again in a few months, I decided instead to fabricate some replacements from a different material. These replacements will, well, *replace* the glass back of the Nexus 4. They will work with the wireless charging and NFC and will not obstruct those. The first batch will be made out of acrylic, but I plan to offer wooden and leather replacements as well if possible.~~

~~I need your help, $14 a transparent cover, and $24 a faux blushed aluminum cover. I will add more perks as demand appears for certain materials.~~

1372043462.0,1gy2hi,6 Months in review - The Nexus 4,dansskittles,101,21,66,"Its been 5 months to the day that I received my nexus 4

**Buying it:** I ordered my Nexus 4 on the 27th November, as they couldn't manufacture the phones fast enough. Now though they are easily available both in the play store and from T-Mobile and even has the option of a white version.

**The Display:** The display is just beautiful. Dark blacks, which with onscreen buttons makes it 720p. Now some people say that it's not 1080p, and their right, it isn't. But in my eyes it doesn't need to be. At normal viewing distances seeing individual pixels is just not going to happen. Never once have I thought anything like ""I wish it was 1080p"".

**The Glass:** As everyone knows the Nexus 4 has glass on both sides. Which urges me to say, its truly not as fun thing to do. Protect your device! Okay so beyond being somewhat fragile even sporting Corning's Gorilla glass 2, the back glass as an awesome reflective feature and the from is curved. Its curves are very subtle and both add to the visual sleekness of the phone and are very useful. Swiping in from the sides is easier and feels so much nicer with the curved edges. However this effect is ruined by the aforementioned, putting a case on the phone.

One huge downside I found to the glass is that over time it becomes less slick or slippery. And what I mean by this is, do gestures and play games. However the coating that makes the glass so nice and smooth and slippery does wear over time. I had a spot towards the center of my phone that just doesn't feel like it used to. More grippy, almost stops your finger mid swype.

**Android and the Nexus 4:** So using the phone everyday is great, and really gets the job done. Running stock android makes things, clutter free / less bloated and this definitely adds to the experience of the phone. Being a Nexus phone, it will also get updates directly from Google. You won't have to wait weeks or months for your carrier to get off their asses to update it. Also being a Nexus phone, its easy to unlock the bootloader, root, and custom rom. With an hour of your time and the click of a few buttons you can be running custom roms that add cool features or improve on performance / battery life. 

**The battery:** Battery life isn't awful, bluetooth... etc will all help make it last as long as it needs to. A lot of people say the battery is awful, which depending on how you use it it can be. But most people shouldn't have to hard of a time keeping it alive during the day. And as always, some custom roms feature improved battery life. However I do recommend bringing a battery backup or charger if you plan on using it to stream multimedia content for extended periods. Even charging for a few minutes can really make it last quite a bit longer.

**Service/Carriers:** The Nexus 4 can be purchased unlocked, your experience may vary. One huge gripe people have with the Nexus 4 is a lack of LTE. This was not a dealbreaker for me, and honestly HSPA + is pretty great. I stream music while checking email, browsing FB and doing all sorts of other things and never have speed issues.

**Everything else:** The phone is packed with features, and a ton of people went for 16 and pushed others to do the same. Now doing so isn't a bad thing, having the space is nice. But to me, not needing it is nicer. The only thing on my Nexus 4 is my apps. All my pictures, videos and songs are all ""cloud"" ( I truly hate that buzzword) based. Now this does mean I need a data connection if I want to use any of it, but its rare for me to be without data or WiFi and I bet it probably is for most of you as well. 

**TLDR:** Overall the phone is rather good

I was also getting annoyed with the way people were bashing on Faux for releasing paid apps to control his kernel

*Provided that your kernel supports the tweak in the first place

**PLEASE UPVOTE FOR VISIBILITY!**  

---  
---  
---  

--**Why init.d scripts over kernel apps?**--  

*Advantages*  

- FREE  

- Control ANY and ALL parameters available on your kernel  

- No need for multiple apps to control different parameters

- Don't have to wait for kernel apps to update if a new tweak is available. This is especially important to those who don't use a kernel that is directly supported by an app (like Motley's or Harsh's or Matrix's kernels) since there might be a specific tweak that only works on a single kernel so that app doesn't support it.

*Disadvantages*  

- Initial setup  

- Changing parameters slightly more annoying (you have to go in with a file explorer and find the line and edit it

- You don't support the kernel developer this way :( But don't feel guilty, and I'm sure they would appreciate it.  

---  
---  
---  

--**How do I write init.d scripts?**--  

Well, highly recommend you to write this out from your computer (any OS will do). For the sake of this guide **I assume you are running Windows**, *however*, if you are running on a **Mac or Linux** (inb4 Stallman copy-pasta) machine then be glad since you cut down on a few hassles, and you **can skip to the next section** if you wish.  

*n00bish technical explanation ahead

The reason why Windows has to take an extra step is because of end-of-line character formatting in text files. In Windows text files, lines end with only the line feed character. Because Android scripts assume you are using Unix text file syntax, when the init.d script is run and the illegal carriage return character is read, the script will fail to run. Thus, you have to make sure that your file is properly formatted. Luckily, all it takes is a single click and all should be good.  

*end of n00bish tech explanation*  


-**I have Windows

1) Download and install [NotePad++] (http://notepad-plus-plus.org/download/v6.3.1.html).  

- [Here] (http://i.imgur.com/vYdvOSn.png) is what NotePad++ looks like upon opening a file.  

2) *Recommended (thanks jazzboyrules!)* Click on ""Language --&gt; S --&gt; Shell"" and when you write your scripts NotePad++ will automatically color parts of your syntax so it is easier to read.

3) After you finish writing your script (explained in the next part) make sure you click on ""**Edit--&gt;EOL Conversion--&gt;UNIX/OSX Format**"" like in [this picture] (http://i.imgur.com/85sGUDI.png).  

---  
---  
---  

--**Actually writing the scripts**--  

*Note: this only covers the VERY basics of what you need. If you are familiar with Shell scripting, you don't need a high level of scripting knowledge to control your kernel's parameters so it's not important.*  

**General Syntax**  

1) Open up a text editor (Windows - use NotePad++ as described above). [This is one of my scripts] (http://i.imgur.com/t1lYJOK.png) that you can use as a reference.

2) First line should have a  

&gt;\#!/system/bin/sh  

this allows you to call upon a ton of BusyBox commands (not important to know)  

3) Use Number Signs (\#) to signify 'comments'. These help you remember what the hell a certain line is doing.  

4) Use 'echo' commands and follow the syntax properly to change kernel parameters.  

The general form is as follows:  

&gt;echo 'XXXXXX' &gt; /the/directory/to/where/the/kernel/parameter/is/exposed/in/sysfs  

example:  

&gt;echo 65 &gt; /sys/module/auto_hotplug/parameters/disable_load_threshold  

5) Write a bunch of these echo statements, no .sh, nothing after the filename. You can do this (on Windows at least) by saving as ""All Type"" or by saving the filename as ""XXXXXXX."" without specifying an extension.

---  
---  
---  

--**Now that your init.d script is written

There are several requirements that your phone must meet.

1) Your RAMDISK (wtf is this you say? don't worry about it!) must support init.d (to use init.d scripts you must have init.d support

2) You must have Busybox installed.  

*How do I know if I meet the requirements?*  

- If you are on a non-stock ROM (as in

- If, then you can install BusyBox using [this handy app] (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=stericson.busybox&amp;hl=en) (just click on Smart Install and let it work its magic) and you can get init.d support [through this app] (http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=1933849).  

*Okay

- You can either place your init.d scripts in /system/etc/init.d (will NOT survive a nightly ROM update)

- You MUST change the permissions on these files to -rwxr-xr-x (755) either by using the 'chmod 755 /directory/to/the/initd/script' command in a Terminal app OR by using an app like Solid Explorer and long-pressing on the file

Reboot and enjoy.

--**What can I control and how - helping you find the relevant parameters.**--

Combine this with the fact that Titanium Backup doesn't work until you root

You can do backups through ADB, failed a few times, and in the end simply did not restore everything I expected (e.g., my Nova Launcher setup). So even after manually copying my SD contents back and forth, and restoring my ADB backup, not everything is as I left it. Lame.

Also, and then halfway through seemed to decide it wasn't worth the effort anymore. So I got half my apps back, and am stuck reinstalling the rest from the Play Store one by one.

**DO NOT CALL AT&amp;T WITH YOUR NEXUS 4'S IMEI NUMBER**

Reason: As explained in [this XDA thread](http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=2021401&amp;highlight=att) the Nexus 4 is not (yet) recognized as a 4G-capable phone on Ma Bell. So the network will default you to a 3G smartphone plan. 

Hopefully

**Setting the APN**

&gt; To get into the APN settings
&gt; Networks&gt;Access Point Names. You can either select the 
&gt; menu button and create a New APN

&gt; Code:
&gt; APN Settings:

&gt; Name: AT&amp;T HSPA+

&gt; APN: pta **(NOTE: IF YOU DON'T HAVE AN LTE PLAN

&gt; Proxy: Not set

&gt; Port: Not set

&gt; Username: Not set

&gt; Password: Not set

&gt; MMSC: http://mmsc.mobile.att.net

&gt; MMS Proxy: proxy.mobile.att.net

&gt; MMS port: 80 **(NOTE: IF MMS ISN'T WORKING

&gt; MCC: 310

&gt; MNC 410

&gt; Authentication type: Not set

&gt; APN type: default,mms,supl,hipri

&gt; APN protocol: IPv4/IPv6

&gt; APN roaming protocol: IPv4/IPv6

&gt; Bearer: Unspecified

Unless you live in Oklahoma City

**APN: phone**

Now, this is enough to activate a 4G plan on your account and give you access to HSPA+ speeds.

From what I've read

You could try to call AT&amp;T or head to a store and plead with them to hook you up. I've read of limited success with this. So it's very YMMV.

Again

I cracked the screen of my N4 and decided to send it to LG for repair rather than buy the part myself and risk screwing up. the cost was only $20 more to send it out so I thought it made sense.

I first contacted LG early July. I took over 4 days for them just to give me the address to send the phone to. I overnighted it to them and waited a week and a half for a diagnosis. They said the repair would be $153.00 total and put a hold on my bank account. Two days later there were two charges totaling $306.00. I called and after 35 minutes on the phone it was back to only one charge. the site updated 2 days later saying the phone had shipped.

A week later without seeing the phone I called them back to check in and was told that there was no tracking number and they did not know where the phone was but the supervisor would be in soon and to expect a call. 6 hours later i call back and get the same response except this time (after 20 more minutes on hold) i get a supervisor saying the phone is still in the repair department because i had not paid the repair bill. 3 more days of calling my bank,,False,self,t5_2v9bv,False,,True

So I decided to revert my phone to stock and do a week long challenge.

For the rest of the week I will run only the stock image (4.2.2) with only the stock applications + Google voice (since I ported my phone number and I need people to be able to call me) and all the stock settings and wifi off.

**Why haven't I gotten the update?**

Google rolls out the update slowly so their servers don't get overloaded. If you wait

**Can I force the update?**

Yes

Method to force update:
 
* Go into Setting -&gt; Apps -&gt; All -&gt; Google Services Framework

* You will see a button for “Clear Data”; clear it.

* Go back to Setting -&gt; About Phone -&gt; System updates and then click the check now button.

* Repeat

**Can I manually install 4.2.2 myself?**

Yes

**Will I lose root if I update?**

If you do the update via the stock method (where it notifies you and you do update)

If you do it using CWM

**Will I get the update if I have TWRP or ClockworkMod installed?**

Yes you'll get it eventually

You can update it easily by just downloading the zip and flashing it in TWRP/CWM.

**How can we regain root if we've lost it?**

Root it again :)

**Will I lose my LTE?**

Yes

**I was on Franco Kernel and now the 4.2.2 update is failing. What can I do?""**

Use the Nexus 4 Toolkit to boot into a temporary CWM and then flash [this kernel](https://www.dropbox.com/s/q9s9tou3by72zn8/N4_421_stock_kernel_and_components.zip?m) and [this kernel](https://www.dropbox.com/s/ypo98ncq94h8wy5/Stock%20Kenrel%20Try%202.zip?m)

Then try the update again and enjoy as it completes.

**I'm getting an error about some assert failed when verifying some apk in ""/system/app

This means you deleted a system app that the update is now trying to verify. Download and install that app

In the future

**I'm having issues with flashing the update

Most likely you were using a non-stock kernel. Go here and flash the two stock kernels

Switching and First Impressions",16,45,http://www.reddit.com/r/nexus4/comments/19s92i/from_iphone_4s_on_verizon_to_nexus_4_on_tmobile/,"A not so brief description of my motivation and experience of my recent switch from iPhone 4S on Verizon to the Nexus 4 on t-mobile. Obviously, this is just my opinion. You may have your own. Post is kind of long so feel free to ctrl f to find what you are looking for or skip around the bold titles. If you have any questions, I will gladly answer to the best of my ability.

**Funding the Switch / Service Plan**

I sold my iPhone 4S which I bought a year ago and got enough money to buy a brand new Nexus 4. Say what you will about the iPhone
Anyway, unlimited data, and unlimited text, no contract obviously). This is huge savings since it leaves me the potential to save nearly $300 this year alone after paying Verizon the ETF. So far I have actually been very impressed with t-mobile’s service. Reception has not been a problem. Calls are clean sounding on both sides even while driving at high speeds. The data speeds are actually very satisfying at the HSPA+ speeds (Coming from 3G on the 4S). 

**First Impression**

The overall appearance of the phone is very minimalist which suits my taste well. The back however has that unique design that everyone has been talking about and I found that to be very attractive as well. The phone feels light as a feather on your hands despite the fact that the screen gives you significantly more real estate over the 4S.
As far as performance goes, with all of these Pros, something had to give; unfortunately it seems that the something ended up being the battery. It isn’t that it’s terrible, it’s OK. Maybe I’ve been enjoying it so much more and I’ve been using it more than I ever did my 4S. But in the end, I can hardly get through a day without having to charge it at some point. 

**Initial Motivation to Switch**

My first motivation to switch was due to the imprisonment my iPhone had me in (Especially combined with Verizon). I am generally not a fan of unlocking or jail breaking my phones since I use it for personal and professional use and I am slightly paranoid about security and ulterior motives those providing you with the software to accomplish this freedom may have. Additionally
I could go on for a while on the specific restrictions that Apple and Verizon put their customers through (Most which can be solved through rooting) but that would get long so I am going to only list the two biggest things that really bothered me enough to make the switch.

1)	I was forced to use iTunes.

This was problematic since I use many devices (Desktop, Mobile) that I like to add/remove my music to/from. iTunes only allows you to add/remove music from one computer without having to completely wipe your phone before pairing it with another system. I also use Linux on one of my computers and iTunes is not available for Linux. The easiest way I found to have my iPhone talk to my Linux system was to virtualize Windows through Virtualbox, install iTunes there, then install some other lib files so that Virtualbox can properly communicate with the iPhone through a USB port. This wasn’t a very intuitive option. Still, this did not fix the problem of adding and removing music from various devices without having to first delete all of the music currently on the phone.

2) Stuck with Verizon.

Even if I stuck it out with my contract with Verizon until the end, they will only unlock it for international use.

Don’t get me wrong

**The Pros of the Nexus 4**

Google all the things! - Native Integration with all of ~~SkyNet’s~~ Google’s services is great! 

- Gmail, Google Maps (I am a big fan).

- Google Voice - (Really handy with pre-paid services).

- Play Music - This solved all of my frustrations with syncing music through various devices. Not only can I plug-and-play drag-and-drop mp3’s into my Nexus 4 from any computer

Device Ownership - I own my device.

- When I go abroad

- I can change carrier on a month to month basis (could even do day-to-day if you really wanted to with some carriers) to any other carrier in the US that supports GSM devices. 

- No bloat ware from my carrier - You know when that awkward moment when you have to explain to your mates that you can’t remove the Zappos app from your phone because Verizon won’t let you.

- Direct Download - All updates come directly from Google. Your carrier doesn’t get to filter out the things they don’t like.

**Part 2 of the saga**

Things took a wild

Waited on hold for about 35 minutes after calling in around 12:15AM CST.  I kept hearing the announcement about how they were under heavy load.  It was fine

I don't want to give out any names or personal identifying information, that's understandable.  As we started opening up a ticket (again) to get to the escalation team, I asked Victory if he could check the serial number of the Nexus 7 I have (CSSN) and if he could match it to someone else.

""Great idea, but who better than the Google Play rep to give me this information than Victory himself.  So I give him this CSSN that's on the box of the Nexus 7 and lo and behold, he found out who should have gotten this very Nexus 7 in my hands.  And... he told me.  He fucking told me... I actually couldn't believe it.  

I wrote down the information (I recorded the call as well

**Part 3 of the sage:  almost there..**

Woke up this morning, I checked out my computer and saw the information for the person who supposedly had my phones.  I contemplated for awhile calling as Google Play (illegal, yes, but I didn't do it) to follow up on their ticket to make sure it was the right person, but no, I didn't do it.  I said fuck it, I'll just ask for the person. Let's name this person Natalia.  Natalia answered the phone as the number I looked up online was her direct number apparantly.  I explained that this conversation was going to be a little weird and told her I believed I had her Nexus 7, most likely trying to gauge what just happened.

I told her who I was, and they matched!  She initially wanted to go through Google Play and I'm happy that she's being a good citizen and will swap with me.

The swap will go down later tonight.  I say Google fucked up big time here, it all worked out.  And I don't have to deal with the worst support team in the entire world.

TL;DR Someone placed the correct packing slip and wrong devices

**I have NOT done the swap yet.  It is now 1:15PM CST

**Update 6:00PM CST**

Received an email from her:

*Google contacted me and after speaking with a supervisor

I sent this back:

*Just wanted to send you these pictures as more proof in case you had doubts about meeting me and exchanging.  Sorry about the sizes!*

*Just call me when you're free

And then received this:

*I have doubts due to the info they provided me.*

**What has Google done to my plan!?!**

**Edit 8:43PM CST**

What. The. Fuck.  Natalia called in to Google again and they advised her not to swap devices with me.  Google said her account was messed up and they told her she needed, and I need to send in the tablet.  They also told her that they disabled the tablet since she did not receive it.

1356598078.0,15ig0u,This subreddit has a real complex recently. The battery is NOT that bad unless you have another problem.,Riddla26,112,51,107,"[This is my Nexus 4.](http://imgur.com/a/DRIt0) Idle over 5 hours

It utterly blows my Galaxy Nexus out of the water for battery life, including active location services and history.

Every other thread in this subreddit is complaining about the battery life without performing any diagnostics, you won't get any help unless you're at least willing to drop a couple of bucks on BetterBatteryStats so we can see which process thread is actually causing your battery to drain.

I don't know if the majority of you have the Nexus 4 as your first smartphone or what the case is

The fact is that Android OS is a blanket term used in the battery list to show a unified amount of drain over time. I think someone in the dev team has left the reporting on for a component they shouldn't have, this could be the radio or another main component.

People are just getting up in arms because of big percentages of small actual numbers. If you check it

Android OS used 21% of battery - keep awake 59m  
Screen 14% - 26m on

Someone would say ""OMG THATS LOADS OF DRAIN!"" and indeed it does seem that way until you consider the following:

Time on battery: 9hr 35m  
Battery remaining: 75%

Then it just becomes amazingly impressive. 9hrs and only 25% battery used with half hour screen on? Sign me up for 8! It absolutely destroys my Galaxy Nexus on battery life and Android OS was hardly ever listed on there

I'm not saying this is the only problem, never stopping for one second to consider it might be something *they're* running causing the problem. It's sickening and it makes us look like a bunch of entitled iFanboys rather than what the Android ecosystem has always been about - people tinkering and customising and ultimately - solving their own problems.

Tl;dr - This phone is amazing and every time I come here I just see people bitching about it without making any sort of attempt to rectify the problem which 9 times out of 10 isn't even down to the device. It's really making me want to unsub.",self,t5_2v9bv,1356598366.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/nexus4/comments/15ig0u/this_subreddit_has_a_real_complex_recently_the/

Update2: Cons I learned so far....... mediocre build quality, no OTG support, battery is not removable (thus no extended battery option), speaker location in the back causes it to sound muffled, device can get warm with heavy usage.

Update3: All in all

Update4: Headphone jack is on top (which is inconvenient) and headphone output through AUX is somewhat low volume (which leads me to believe that LG used a cheaper amplifier chip)

Update5: For those of you who think the output volume is low....JimboLodisC provided links to the external amplifiers you can look into.

* Charging:  From 14% to 98% in 2 hours 25 minutes (actually I think it was faster than this as it had gone into cycling mode).

* Power draw: .1 Amp at the outlet until it gets to about 95% when the draw drops to .05 to .06 amp.  power draw when the Nexus is not on the orb alternates between .01 Amp and 0.  Over the past 248 hours the Orb has drawn .2 kWh total.

* When not charging the Orb will use a one half second on and one half second off cycle to check to see if the Nexus is on the orb.  This cycling emits a weak EM field.  At two inches from the orb I can detect about 900 milligauss each time it cycles on and off.  At 4 inches the EM is effectively background.  (Prior readings were contaminated by my alarm clock.)

* Don't ask me to explain it but when the Nexus is on the Orb and it is charging there is almost no detectable EM field even if I put the Trifield right on top of the phone.

* Did another charge test.  Went from 24% to 60% in 1 hour which is consistent with prior result and is roughly 1/2 % of battery per minute.  That implies that to go from 0% to 100% would take about 200 minutes or 3.3 hours.  During this charge

* Plan to check charge status when various metals are placed on the orb.

* Check power draw when Nex is on Orb AND also plugged into a USB charger.",self,t5_2v9bv,1362639209.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/nexus4/comments/19khfr/my_analysis_of_the_orb/

Then I got it and that was the problem. It doesn't ""just work"". 


My impression of the charger was crushed by reality and because of it's design. It's a beautiful charger

I expected and hoped for a magnet in the charger

Next issue was after it slid until the bottom of the phone touched the surface below the charger

Lastly


So to use this charger I had to clean it and my phone before use, it would have slipped off sometime at night. 

I feel like the Orb should have been flat instead of at an angle

TLDR; get cerberus

So 2 days ago I lef my cellphone in a cab and the driver took off.  Tried to track it using cereberus commands via their webpage or their text commands but it seemed it wasn't working. The person that had my phone had no intentions of giving it back

The relevant part is: Cerberus gave me the location of the device yersteday night, and the text commands came out as plain text. It gave me a 30 meter radius of where my phone could be, I got lucky and found the car, asked around and one of his ''friends' told me the guy's name. 

I came back this morning with some company and yelled at his window and he evetually came down form his 3rd story studio flat (this was located in a not very nice part of town in Lima

Finally he gave told me some bullshit about his ''friend'' selling him the device for 200 soles

The reason I wanted to share this is beacause I learned a few things out of this. 

1) Cerberus works well, IP number, and will give you an approximate adress. 

2) The service provider is not able to track an unlocked phone

3) They are also not allowed to disclose the thiefs adress w/o  an official police request

4) Doing some basic detective work will really increase your chances of recovering this

Finally I hope you never have to go throught this, even though it will take some patience. ",,False,self,t5_2v9bv,False,,

Lets say its 10:30 and im about to leave for work, 2 minutes longer than usual""...I think Great! But then I realize its not the way I go to work, oh well i take back roads. no biggie. But i cant change it. So i travel to and from work every day for months now and Google Now STILL thinks i take the highway to work, and always tells me driving times and traffic based on this route, it cant seem to learn. Also seemingly stupid, Google Now will tell me the time to work ALL THE TIME. Despite having an alarm in my phone labeled Work and despite me having an almost never changing work schedule, Google Now never seems to learn. And so I am constantly told how long it takes to get to work, on a route i never take
  
The *Researching* cards are nifty. And they keep my scatterbrained self interested and up to date on the things im working on. However, news, highlights, fantasy football, etc and it never shows me anything related to the NFL, I looked up the score to an NBA playoff game for a friend once, WONT STOP showing me scores and schedules. On the card if you press the ""!"" you get a prompt at the bottom of the card that asks if you are in fact researching the topic at hand. Hitting yes or no highlights the option but there is no close or ok
  
Also as a side note, player stats, etc. its like a mini score center. When i use google now I only get the score. and when i expand i still only get the score with a swipe like scedule browser, nothing more. Also when you program your favorite teams in the settings section of the sports card, you can ONLY search for teams, it would be nice to be able to ""like"" or select players, sports in general, etc  
  
Whats the deal with **Show more cards**? is there an option to always just have all the cards come up? I wish I didnt have to hit that everytime, I wish it would always show me all my cards. and if there wasnt anything new put the card at the bottom and make it small or noticably empty of new content.  
  
I understand Google Now is meant to be very intuitive, and actually benefits.  
  
Sorry for this rant

1373979437.0,1ierz7,"Debugging the ""no mobile data until reboot"" issue",Cputerace,63,16,32,"So I have seen a few people post about an issue

Basically my nexus 4 gets into a state frequently whereby the mobile data simply will not work until I reboot the phone. I have heard people mention it happens when they are in wifi for a long time then leave it. I only see it when I am in wifi AND out of cell range for a while.

Details (post a comment if you have anything helpful to add to this list):

Phone:

Stock Nexus 4 black 8gb purchased from Google Play in March.
NOT rooted/modified in any way other than:
Nova launcher


Plan:
T-mo 100/unlimited $30 pre-paid

When it happens:
My house has zero t-mo service, the icons continue exactly as they are when it is working (same number of bars and same e/h indicator in the same location) except everything is grey. When I get to work (right next to a second cell tower), everything is still grey until I connect to the work wifi. As soon as I connect to the work wifi, my mobile indicator turns blue, BUT does not indicate ""H"" which it does when ""working"" at work (as the cell tower is right there). If I subsequently turn off and on the wifi, the mobile data indicator will turn grey/blue in tandem (grey when wifi off, blue when wifi on).

Bluetooth is on and connects to my car as soon as I turn it on to leave (still in range of wifi

Note that connecting to the wifi at work all day, it is ONLY when I have been out of cell range for an extended period. This could indicate either that the ""time away"" has to be more like 14 hours (overnight) and 8 hours at work is not enough, or (most likely) that the issue is going from ""wifi/no cell"" to ""no wifi/no cell"" to ""no wifi/cell"".

I have tried toggling airplane mode, mobile data), and the only thing that fixes it (and it fixes it every time) is rebooting the phone.",,False,self,t5_2v9bv,,http://www.reddit.com/r/nexus4/comments/1ierz7/debugging_the_no_mobile_data_until_reboot_issue/

So far I love it. The main things I think may be of interest are:

* This is definitely legit Qi. I checked Zens out on the official Qi website. I was going to buy one of the Fasttech chargers but they seemed sketchy and I couldn't find any claim they were certified (""compatible"" might not be the same thing).

* The charging zone isn't too finnicky. I have to be careful putting the phone in place, but I think that's the nature of Qi. I thought the screen was supposed to turn on and make a noise, but this is my first day on Paranoid Android and I may have missed something in the settings. At some point I'll put down some tape or something to help me line it up right every time, but as long as you take 2 seconds to line it up you shouldn't have problems.

* It works well with my relatively thick [Ionic Guardian case](http://www.amazon.ca/Ionic-GUARDIAN-Armor-Nexus-Black/dp/B00A06Z41E), but for now I don't think I need to worry about the case trapping in a lot of heat. The charge from 80% to 100% was surprisingly quick. I can hold the phone (with case) a millimeter or two in the air above the charger and it'll still work, so I think there's even more leeway. I assume charge time and efficiency suffer with increasing distance, though like I said so far I'm pleased with my initial experience. **EDIT: I'm charging from low battery for the first time, and the battery actually stabilized at 38C. Quite a bit higher than before. Charge speed is shockingly fast though: 25% to 75% in just over an hour.**

* The LED is nice and subtle. It's bright enough that you can see it in daylight

If anyone has any questions, I'm happy with the price, and that its completely flat surface mean it should easily be forward-compatible with just about any phone or tablet that comes out with Qi in the future.

UK 1-2 week shipping estimate-er here.

I know everyone is super psyched to get their phones and stuff but... People are really really hounding the Google CSRs. From another thread someone had one of the ""Ships in 1 - 2 weeks"" ordered on Nov 27th and called (from context presumably not for the first time) last night. Now Nov 27th to Dec 5th is barely a week. We really shouldn't be bugging these guys until the orders are dispatched late. We're just making more work for them when they're probably understaffed and overworked as it is and tired of looking at your damn shipping order on their system which isn't going to be any different than any of the other thousands of orders that are in the exact same state.

When there are updates

I think it's great that everyone is so keen to get hold of the N4 and I understand, but now I know it's a waiting game.

I worked in CS for a while and I really feel for those guys. I won't be calling at least until it's actually PAST the 2 week shipping estimate I got on the 4th Dec, so I'm just going to chill the fuck out until a shiny box lands in my lap.

You can't rush these things and you know what they say:

Good things come to those who wait.

I've spent the last few weeks testing out various custom kernels trying to get the best battery life/performance ratio from just the kernel's default settings. I only adjust the color settings if even available.

So far

* Motley kernel build 49 - Probably my favorite kernel. I get good battery life while having close-to-stock performance. If only Motley would come back to update it.
* Matr1x 9.5 - Nice performance and battery life as well
* Faux (6-22) - I heard a lot of good things about the kernel
* IntersectRaven (3.4.47) - I really liked the dev's no OC, just flash and forget philosophy. Sort of unremarkable when I tried it, which isn't a bad thing at all. Felt very much like stock.
* Franco r156 - Finally caved in to see what all the hype was about. I still got comparable battery performance to motley and matr1x
* Franco M3 - I didn't notice decreased frame rate like I did with r156. Still similar battery life but was a good experience overall. I'd try it again soon.

Right now I'm back on stock just so I can reset my baseline expectations again. After another charge cycle

I contacted LG 10 days ago and this was their ultimate response at the time (via chat): 

&gt;Okay, would that be okay, John?

I never received any email so I contacted them again today. Now it looks like this: 

&gt;9:35 AM	 Joe:	 As far as we know, should be handled through the carriers as well 9:36 AM	 Joe:	 As an additional information, we have received information that there is nothing on this unit that will tend to break, as well if it is torn up, this would not be covered by the warranty as the warranty does not cover physical, cosmetic or liquid damage

and finally: 

&gt;... however we have already contacted upper management regarding this and the answer the gave us is that LG does not provide any warranty for this accessory

I wasn't sure how I'd handle not having a menu button, I don't have to worry about the button getting loose or recessing like I was constantly worried about on the S3

S3 wins this one
-Storage

-Stock Keyboard:

For anyone considering it for business, don't get me wrong, and I want to defend the phone as much as the next guy, but I understand you need an honest usage/battery life ratio.

1.) Any way to change the look of the messaging app? The iPhone had colors to separate who is who

2.) The headphone volume is very low

3.) Vibration seems a tad weak

4.) Any way to put missed calls/texts on the lock screen? I saw my friend's Note had the ability to open straight to the phone/messaging app.

5.) Is visual voicemail a thing on Android? I tried using Google Voice but keep getting errors

Some people blamed the card reader since stores rarely ever fix them if they break but I tested an RFID credit card on the same reader and it worked just fine. It was a problem on the phone then.

Literally a few of seconds of searching resulted in a reason: ISIS branded sim cards have NFC secure elements and cause a conflict with Google's own NFC secure element in the phone. This isn't the case on some other NFC equipped devices like the GS3 but seems to be an issue on the N4.

What is ISIS? It's a new payment scheme partnered with T-Mobile, and if you don't you can use their NFC sim cards to make purchases. All you need to know is their sim cards cause problems for google wallet, and perhaps other features and isn't currently compatible with the N4.

How did you get a ISIS sim card? Probably when you got your micro-sim from your carrier you were in an ISIS test market and they gave you one without asking since the problem couldn't have been predicted.

My carrier, free of charge, to a non-ISIS sim after I called up support and told them the sim card was interfering with the NFC chip on my phone. I recommend going to an official store to make sure the replacement sim is not ISIS branded since employees are not yet aware of differences; you can chalk that up to the slow propagation of NFC tech until recently.

To tell ISIS and regular sims apart you would look for ISIS logos in the plastic cartridge from which the sim card is removed. In addition

I called them up yesterday, and finally making a purchase for the first time.

and wanted to pass it on to everyone here in /r/nexus4.

This website had the best layout and info regarding APNs:  
http://www.unlockit.co.nz/mobilesettings/settings.php?id=277

My setting are as follows:

APN: alwayson-r6.ktfwing.com

APN Roaming: IPV4  
*You should seeAPN enable/disbale greyed out and enable*

Now this is specific to S. Korea using KT (Korea Telecom). Also the only notable difference I found after entering countless different combination of info was that the default MCC was 450 and should be left that way and the default MNC of 05 should be changed to 08. Everything else should be left at default.  

I could have saved myself a lot of time and frustration if I just kept default and made as few changes as possible at first but I managed to get it to work in the end.  

If anyone has any questions specific to Nexus 4 &amp; Korea I will try my best to help although I just inputed information. All the leg work was done by Danrant and other within this forum.

1365821923.0,1c8zxs,Nexus 4 headphones - Mini review!,MrAdamXD,47,12,48,"I just drove up to my local FedEX facility to pick these headphones up early. [Here's an album of the pictures I put together.](http://imgur.com/a/f7yJB) 

**DESIGN**

I'm a big fan of the way these headphones were designed. The fettuccini - like cord helps prevent tangling when you throw the headphones in your pocket. The headphone jack is an L shape, and that cancellation works well! If you're not a fan of noise cancellation, don't worry, because these headphones come with other optional tips. Many people are saying that these are the exact same headphones that come with the LG optimus G, but that's not true. They have the Nexus logo on the back of the head of the headphones, and come in a different packaging. Everything else, though, located under the left headphone. These headphones have a premium look

9.7

**SOUND**

The sound is average, but it isn't bad either (this also depends on the noise level you have it set on.) On that note, these headphones sound really loud, this may be thanks to the help of the noise cancelling tips. Overall, these headphones produce a clean sound, so there's no need to expect anything tinny or quiet!

8.2

**MICROPHONE** 

The microphone isn't so great. I have tested it multiple times using the audio recording section on Google Keep, though.

5.9

**OVERALL RATING**

A solid 8.0. I would definately recommend this headset to a friend, ask in the comments or PM me!",,False,self,t5_2v9bv,False,,

First and foremost, Poetic Borderline bumper, and Poetic Palette). I'm using it with a dbrand skin with no issues, and it looks awesome with the black carbon. It feels super sturdy, too; it looks and feels like it could take a beating. It adds a millimeter or two of thickness all around, but the case is shaped exactly like the phone so it's not too noticeable. The black sides of the case are just flexible enough to slide the phone in while still fitting perfectly. All of the ports/holes have plenty of space, including the headphone jack.

**The not so good:**

It doesn't have much grip, but when holding it regularly the material doesn't feel soft like rubber or TPU. There's also no physical feedback when pushing the buttons. Without the case, all of my buttons click; with the case, I can't feel anything.

1368779031.0,1ei9sw,Review: $32 eBay Wireless Qi Charger,crundy,39,6,34,"I recently stumbled across a cheap Qi charger on eBay ([link](http://www.ebay.com/itm/Wireless-Qi-Power-Charger-Pad-Receiver-for-Lumia-920-I9300-Note-II-LG-Nexus-4-/400460762726?ssPageName=ADME:L:OC:GB:3160)) and thought for the price I should give it a go. Delivery to the UK was free

The design is [as you'd expect](http://i.imgur.com/eEiOfhw.jpg), so I had to fish out one of my old adapters). The input looks pretty standard so I'm sure you can find a replacement power cable if needs be.

[Charging](http://i.imgur.com/hVAlp6l.jpg) the Nexus 4 works perfectly. It doesn't seem to be too fussy about where I put the phone, and then alternate back and forth as the phone switches the charging on and off. The LED isn't especially bright, so it shouldn't keep you awake at night. If you do have a problem then I guess you could stick a bit of masking tape over it, or open up the charger and colour one side of the LED cover with a black marker. People always talk about their phones getting hot when using wireless charging, but I've only noticed my phone getting a bit warm on the charger, certainly not as hot as when I've been doing something intensive on the phone like gaming.

As with most Qi chargers, it doesn't beep every time charging restarts) and there is a status LED on the charger and so a buzzer seems completely unessessary.

Fortunately this is really easy to fix. Just pop off the 4 sticky feet on the back of the charger and unscrew the 4 exposed screws. [Open the charger up](http://i.imgur.com/H5FuQfZh.jpg) (watch out for the LED cover, press the lid back on, and reassemble the unit. Hey presto, no more beeping!

One oddity I did notice yesterday which I haven't been able to replicate today is that sometimes when I placed my N4 on the charger, or wrong unlock codes entered (depending on whether the phone was locked or not). I can only imagine this was a blip with the phone rather than the charger, but I'd be interested to know if anyone else has this problem with a Qi charger?

So anyway, and disabling the buzzer was incredibly easy. I think I may have to get another one for my office.

1374281789.0,1io3g5,A warning to anyone who has to go through LG to get their phone repaired.,NudistBuddhist,39,11,23,"This'll probably get buried

**Monday June 17** - My Nexus 4 somehow slid off of my bathroom counter and hit the tile floor

**Tuesday June 18** - I shipped my phone to LG as directed and chose overnight shipping as I needed the phone back before my vacation which started on July 5.

**Thursday June 20** - I checked the tracking of my shipment because I hadn't heard back from LG yet. I noticed that delivery was attempted the day before

**Monday June 24** - I got a call from LG saying that it would be $153 to repair the screen (as I expected)

**Wednesday June 26** - I noticed that my bank account was showing two payments to LG, after being on the phone with them for about an hour and a half that night.

**Thursday June 27** - I called LG and asked about the status of my phone. I was told that repairs were complete and that it would be shipping out by the end of the day. Also

**Saturday June 29** - I noticed that I had a voicemail from Friday night about 5:15 pm. It was a girl from LG saying that my payment was declined and that I needed to call them Monday to re-process the payment so that my phone could get shipped back to me. I checked my bank account online and it still showed both payments

**Monday July 1** - By Monday morning the second charge finally had gone away

**Tuesday July 2** - I called again to check the status of my phone

**Friday July 5** - I called in the morning to get the status of my phone

**Monday July 8** - I called yet again to ascertain what was going on with my phone, I was pretty much desensitized to the anger that I had previously been feeling.

**Wednesday July 10** - I got a notification with my tracking number and it was to arrive on July 11

**Saturday July 13** - I finally get the phone back from FedEx and am quite relieved. However, my phone was rooted and I had backed up my phone with Clockwork Recovery Mod after it broke, so I was expecting to be able to just restore it. I couldn't do that, and had some mobile authenticators installed that I have yet to get taken care of. Two, if they had sent me a refurbished phone from the beginning, I wouldn't have had to wait almost four weeks to get the damn thing back. They clearly lost my phone somewhere along the process and just decided to give me a refurbished one (which could have its own slew of issues).

Like I said earlier, but it left me feeling very sour towards LG. I had always been a big fan of LG. I've bought TVs, computer monitors, computer parts, and more, and even recommended their products when I used to work retail. But they not only cost me time (I probably spent a good five or six hours total speaking with customer service), but money. I paid for overnight shipping that was wasted, not to mention that my monthly plan with T-Mobile pretty much went to waste. And through all of this, but the service that was provided to me was abysmal

I'm not suggesting that everybody will have the same experience as me

You will need root and the full version of GMD. 

Install the two apps linked above. Spend some time playing with GMD and getting the feel for custom gestures. Here is how I have mine setup:

* Back - Swipe right to left from the upper right (very natural) (default gesture)
* Home - swipe up from the bottom center (where the home button used to be!)
* Recent apps - swipe up from the button right (use the 1/3 bottom
* Menu - swipe right to left from bottom right corner (this time use bottom 1/3 of right side)
* Screen off - three fingers touching anywhere on the screen
* Media play/pause - two finger tap anywhere on screen
* Media next - two fingers moving right
* Media prev - two fingers moving left
* Alt tab - one finger starting in the center 1/3 of right side of screen. Move up and left. 
* Next app - one finger starting from right 1/3 of bottom edge
* Previous app - one finger starting from right 1/3 of bottom edge

Open fullscreen toggle and tell it to disable your bottom bar. It will probably soft reboot your device. Then open the app again

1373941466.0,1idvc2,Google's RMA technical support is a nightmare.,Vliger2002,44,17,30,"This is just my experience, have not.  

**Problem:**

It all started with the fact that my Nexus 4 (Black, though. This happened within the first 4 months of owning my Nexus 4. It was on stock room, unrooted, when this issue occurred. I was using it lightly (not for gaming or anything), and I never dropped my device (I also have a solid, protective case).

**Troubleshooting:**  

* Toggling the Wi-Fi on and off
* Switch the Wi-Fi frequency band to 5GHz on the device
* Rebooting the device and the router
* Updating the router firmware
* Changing the 5GHz channel on the router 
* Factory Reset
* Custom ROM

**How I knew it was a faulty device:**  

My sister recently got a White Nexus 4 (White, my desktop computer, a Galaxy S4, and all 6 of the iPads in the house.  
  
**The Google RMA Experience:**  

*CALL 1:*  

I decided to take care of this issue by contacting Google. I do have a SquareTrade warranty, and I talked to Erin over the phone about my problem. He agreed that it was faulty, and definitely needed a replacement (I told him about my sister's N4, as well). He told me that would get a follow-up E-mail within the next couple minutes, and would also receive my replacement order form by Sunday (within 24 hours).

I got the follow up E-mail pretty shortly, generic e-mail that didn't require a reply.

Sunday morning rolls around, ""Alright, I'll try Monday, I know they've got to be working on weekdays."" So I sent Erin a message at 12:46PM today (7/15/13) asking about my replacement order form, and also putting the correct spelling of my name. He replied at 6:23PM, stating that a specialist replied, asking for my modem make and model.  

First off, and that I knew my device was faulty because I have a second N4 that works perfectly. Secondly, you don't need to know the make and model of my **modem**. Erin, what you and your specialist were looking for was the make and model of my Wi-Fi **router**. Two very different things. Lastly, he ignored the correction of my name, and referred to me as ""Dillan"" two times. They sure know how to make the customer feel important!

*CALL 2:*  

So instead of replying to the E-mail and getting a response on Tuesday, and how I didn't receive a replacement order form. I also told her how Erin asked about my *modem* and not my *router*. She assured me that they didn't need my *modem* information, but they did need my *router* information for the RMA form. I gave her the information, and she processed it right there. I got a follow-up e-mail with the appropriate RMA sheet, shipping label and the link to order my replacement device.  

However, or if they just decided that they would replace my Black N4 with a White N4. I do not want a White N4.  

*CALL 3:*  

So yes, not a White N4. He tells me he'll forward my case to a specialist (seriously? Kim didn't need a specialist, although she did mess up my order). We hang up, and he sends me a follow-up e-mail titled:  

*""Customer is calling in today because he received an RMA form for his white Nexus 4 but its his black nexus 4 thats having the wifi issues""*  

He misunderstood. I said I got the order form for a White replacement, but they accidentally gave me a link to order a White N4 instead of a Black N4. I e-mailed him back, letting him know, and he forwarded the info to the specialist.

None of these Google Tech support representatives bothered to confirm the issue with me at the end of the call. They didn't make sure that *they* understood what I needed. I wasn't asked, correct?""  

This is probably the worse customer support I've had to deal with from a company with such a huge reputation. This is **Google** we're talking about. I'd expect that their employees knew what they were talking about and had a very strict protocol so that they could ensure the issue would be handled 9/10 times on the FIRST call.

[Some photos are available here](http://imgur.com/a/a9CLX). I don't have another camera to hand

**Charging placement (4/5)**

One of the main reasons I held off buying a QI charger until now is that many people seemed to find aligning the device on the 'sweet spot' of most charging pads to be difficult.

The key selling point of this pad is that it contains seven charging coils

So does it work? In a word, and it is possible to 'miss' the charging area if you're not looking and leave the Nexus overhanging the top or bottom too much. However, there is there is a lot of leeway (a couple of inches in each direction), and placing the device correctly on the pad is very easy.

I use the official N4 bumper

I've found the charging time to be comparable (maybe slightly higher) to using an AC charger, the charger will trickle charge the battery - when I pick my phone up in the morning, the battery level is always between 95-100%. The N4 gets a little warm when charging, but nothing too bad. 

**Design/build quality (4/5)**

The pad seems well made, which is dim enough that it doesn't bother me at night, even though it's just a few inches from my head. There is no beeper.

The pad is very small (smaller in length than the N4) and thin. The only downside to this is that the top or bottom of the N4 will overhang, it is possible to place the N4 so that it misses the charging area. This isn't a major issue though, as long as the device is vaguely in the middle and to the left of the pad, it charges just fine. In two weeks of daily usage, I've placed it properly first time every time.

**TL;DR - a great charging pad,False,self,t5_2v9bv,1370643124.0,,,t3_1fw2oj

I've come to realize that mediaserver is actually responsible for ANY audio that comes from your phone's speaker (aside from voice calls.) It first became apparent to me when I was playing Ingress a lot. Mediaserver would always show up whenever I played Ingress. Then, and what do you know? Mediaserver usage shot up. This is most easily noticeable after the phone has been fully charged because mediaserver would only be using a very small portion of the total battery (but a large portion of used battery.) I urge you to try it yourself if you're still curious about mediaserver. 

Finally, which seems like it would just be streaming the data from the network directly into memory. Please correct me if I'm wrong about this.

Later that day

At first I thought this wouldn't be a problem. Clerical error

So I contacted Google. I let them know that the packing slip had the wrong information. They first asked for the name and address on the slip. Easy enough.

At the beginning of the next business day

&gt;Hello BostonGraver
&gt;
&gt;Thanks for contacting Google
&gt;
&gt;If the package is successfully delivered in spite of the delivery
&gt;
&gt;IMPORTANT: Don't open the package. Our shipping provider will not allow refusal of delivery for opened packages.

As I could read it, you can refuse delivery"". Ok. But there were two things wrong with this email

1. I had no intention of sending the device back. I ordered it. I wanted it.
2. I **HAD** to open the box to see the incorrect packing slip


I shot back an email within minutes. A couple hours later, wondering why I would have to go without the phone because the packing slip was wrong, as if it was my fault. Fifteen minutes later, I was asked for the serial number on the box. I gave it, and also said that the IMEI on the packing slip matched the phone's IMEI. My contact point said ""I see that device belongs to someone else"".

He then said that unless I sent it back
&gt; - Restocking fee of 15% if package is opened; no restocking fee for unopened packages.

Oh man was I mad. I sent another message back pointing out that because of Google's logistical error:

* Unless I sent the phone back
* I wouldn't have a phone for the time it took me to ship it, and the transit time for that phone
* I would be paying for cell service I couldn't use during that time.
* I would have to pay $53 for the privilege of not having a phone and wasting cell service because I had opened the box of the device I ordered. 

I offered some helpful suggestions like sending me a replacement FIRST

My email was forwarded to ""a specialist"". Two days passed


This email contained a link to Google Checkout for another Nexus 4. It was a special link that only places a hold on the card unless I don't return the original device. I was sent a UPS label
