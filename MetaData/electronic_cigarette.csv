Let's try to make the front page with the information in this subreddit. There are some people out there who can greatly benefit

I used to smoke cigarettes. I would smoke any brand, the ground, ashtrays, and make ""frankensmokes"" --little rolled up burnt nasties of the devils blend. This was destroying my lungs and self respect. I tried to quit cold turkey, with medicine, patches, and nothing helped. My wife hated sleeping with me, and I couldn't taste food.
I first purchased an nJoy e-cig on a bus tour i was doing with musicians who had a strict no-smoking policy in the bus. I didn't think I could do it, cheaper, tastier way. 
I decided to do some internet research and I found reddit and all the helpful information on r/electronic_cigarette

If you wanna get started, browse the forum, use the links to the right and make the most of this subreddit!

We would love to help you get started with some information and help you along your way to quitting smoking and to start vaping. Your life may depend on it! There are countless success stories like mine out there.
Thanks. Please upvote/send to friends!

Between my mod and your cig-a-like is something called an eGo. It has a much better battery than a cig-a-like. And rather than buying those pre-filled carts online, cartomizers, etc etc.

What does this mean for you?

Sections 905 and 910 would ban all e-cigarettes

If this action does not completely destroy the industry on it's own this would be the first step in an all out attack on your ability to use electronic cigarettes. A ban on internet sales and significant taxes would almost surely follow.

This is the most significant threat to our right to vape here in the US since electronic cigarettes were introduced.

Sucralose apparently breaks down into water and HCl. At a first glance this doesn't appear to be an issue because obviously neither water or HCl (in low concentrations) are poison. The issue seems to be that HCl may react with VG and possibly PG to form [Chloropropanol](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3-MCPD) which is a known carcinogen. You can visually compare it with [VG](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycerol) and [PG](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propylene_glycol) to see that a substitution of Cl will produce this substance.

I wasn't actively looking for a sweetner alternative when I found this Wikipedia page on [sugar alcohols](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sugar_alcohol) while looking at properties of Nicotine, has a compatible boiling point (it will vaporize without burning), is twice as sweet as VG (the same as table sugar), and has been thoroughly tested as non-toxic to humans.

In the video currently getting bumped around on this sub there is one point where I feel like the guy's being responsible. He says ""I need to change the battery

Do you know why they're suited? Do you know why he's swapping after just a couple of hours? Now... Do you know how many coils he had or how big his air holes were or what device he was using? If you can't answer with 100% certainty the first two questions but CAN answer the last few... you're the person this is for. 

Running an 'extreme' vapor set up for the purposes of generating enormous clouds of vapor is risky. You're pushing batteries to or beyond their operational capacity when you throw low ohm

The mechanical mod was a great idea at first... people were upset by the fact that their egos kept burning up because of the crappy wires and boards in them so they bypassed the limiting factor

In a mechanical mod with a solid metal piston for a switch and 0 wires

Yes, after recent conversations with Panasonic/Sanyo, Sony, and Samsung, they don't even like the fact that we're USING these batteries because they're not intended for single cell, unprotected use in any device. The fact that they're available can be attributed to modders of flashlights, pen lasers and bicycle electronics. A demand formed around those markets and it was filled by various folks

These batteries are not built for what we're doing to them. I'm not telling you NOT to do it... don't get me wrong, I know what I'm doing, how I'm doing it, and what the implications are and how to mitigate risks. If you don't... ask, learn, figure it out and don't just take some random Youtube video, drill out your RBA caps and start blowing clouds. 

I'll give you a couple of tips but it's by no means all the info you need to have in your brain to push these set ups to the limit so please... it's better to learn before you do something to avoid a bad situation than to jump in

1. Only use IMR batteries and only big ones. Don't do this with an 18350. Go 18650 and don't push your luck. 

2. If you don't own a multimeter

3. Know your amp limits on the batteries you're using, watts, volts, etc. Operate within the manufacturer constraints and if you decide to ""push it"" do it once or twice then stop. 

4. Check yoru battery constantly. Take 10 hits on some super vape set up... check the battery. Change it at the appropriate time.

5. If the battery gets hot... stop, wait 5 minutes and check on the battery, if it's hotter find a safe place to put it where it's not going to do any damage, wait for the battery to finish doing whatever it's gonna do (theres a variety of things that 'could' happen at this point) and when it's done, clean up. If you don't know how to clean up a failed battery, google it. 

6. If you make a video of your phat clouds... please

I want y'all to be safe, don't monkey see monkey do this stuff unless you've educated yourself on all the factors that go into it and how to mitigate risk.

Yeah, and as amazing as my bbq was when I was smoking, it's even better now.  So thank you.

Now for the back story.

I quit smoking one month ago today during one of the most stressful times in my life.  Two months ago my fourth son was born 2 months early. He spent 3 weeks in the NICU with breathing issues.  Managing work

The next day my wife called me in a panic and told me that my son was being rushed back to the hospital via an ambulance.  She was taking him to his Dr. appointment and when she got there and was pulling him out of his car seat, I work about 8 blocks from it and don't have a car).  I also smoked 3 cigarettes. I wanted my mic fix now, the only way I knew I could get it fast.

We were in the hospital for another 5 days while they did any kind of test under the sun.  Blood, cat scans, x-rays, MRI’s…. It turned out that he had contracted parainfluenza (which most people never know they get) and it was causing respiratory issues.  During the stay I couldn’t just leave and have a smoke so I went into the bathroom and vooped my crappy peach liquid in my crappy clearomizer with my crappy battery….. but I never left his room. I was always there with him.

After he came home again I threw away my stash of cigarettes. I’ve upgraded my gear, and so am I. One month down, and forever more to go.

Thank you everyone, and buying from everyone’s recommendations. Y’all kept me sane during the countless alarms, hospital stays, and sleepless nights.",,False,self,False,t3_1k7hdf

HB372 is being proposed this year which has the potential to ban internet sales of your products to residents of the state by requiring face to face transactions. This bill under the current wording could also be taken to mean that it prevents you from selling via the internet to ANYONE anywhere. This is another one of Representative Ray's pet anti-smoking/nicotine bills that he introduces each year.

This bill is being heard in the House Health and Human Services Standing Committee Wednesday afternoon just after 4pm. If you value your internet sales, taxes paid to the state, etc to fight for this bill to be removed.

His bill states there will be no financial impact of this bill being passed thus it's obvious he has zero clue the amount of business done in the state. He's estimating over 1.5 million in added revenue due to taxation however his bill leads me to believe the taxation for both the ecig and smokeless products will be brought to the same levels as tobacco cigarettes (although it does not specifically state how they will be taxed or at what rate). The bill also will ban all forms of advertisement for your business which could have detrimental impact to your longevity as a vendor in the state.

He asked about the atomizers, besides they don't contain any nicotine (Canada).  I showed him my travel case of atomizers with different juices, he was quite impressed with that as well.

He asked about the juice... I explained it was varying amounts of PG and VG, and asked if you need to do that.  I assured him you could buy pre-mixed juices pretty easily, but you have to do it online in Canada, but that I'm DIYing because I'm just that kind of guy, plus to save money in the long run.

He asked how much I used it.  I told him lately I'd been chain-vaping, and that I'm even vaping 0 nicotine juice now.  I also told him that's pretty much how it goes with these things... that I'm on a forum where others have told their stories of switching to vaping, and that most have the same experience.

He asked how it felt, you can definitely tell if there's even a small amount of nicotine in the juice, and although not quite like smoke, it was satisfying in a similar way.  He asked if you inhale with these... I told him, you can but you don't need to, the nicotine is mostly absorbed in the mouth and throat regardless of whether you inhale.  He said that's what cigar smokers have told him, and it makes sense.

I told him I'd been coughing up gunk... he said, but that's after 36 years of heavy smoking).

I gave him some cards I had in my wallet from canvape.com

I told him that Health Canada was recommending against them due to their ""untested"" status... he was dismissive.  Not of the untested status

About the only thing I think he didn't ask was how much it cost... he just seemed to assume it was a lot cheaper than cigarettes (we really get dinged with taxes in the Socialist Republic of Canada).

As we said goodbye he congratulated me on quitting

ATTENTION VAPERS (ESPECIALLY SOUTH CAROLNA) - A new bill is on the books (sponsored by RJ Reynolds) that would raise taxes in this states (and other adopting states) of a minimum of 0.05 Per ML of e-liquids in state tax - this is before any applied federal or state sales taxes. 

This will also open the door for future e-cigarette taxes that we as vapers have absolutely NO representation in! Looking at how cigarette taxes have increased in the last 5 years - this is bad news for the industry - but great news from big tobacco companies like Phillip Morris

So, and I include myself up until now, are sort of relying on various organized groups out there to handle this for us. I see the occasional letter to congress, but really, we need something formal, national and local. Any interest? 

Second, no? Can we find out who is on this committee? Can we find out who at the FDA is handling the matter? 

This is important guys. They are talking about only letting licensed manufactures being able to get nic liquid. Do you think Rich at Gremlin or TheVaperChef will have the money to get licensed or pay for the oversight? Nope. We will be forced to use big tobacco prefilled cartons.

There are some AWESOME liquid vendors out there, taste, steep, test, vape in a never ending cycle for juice to add to my does not taste like satan wearing perfume pile. While I know that one persons favorite flavor is another persons ass crack... (wait that came out way wrong)

Some things I would like to see from various vendors.

1) If you are doing business on the web

2) For the love of god
Seriously... If you want to be cute.. be cute

3) Go look up sites that sell bespoke coffee

When tasting coffee (cupping) you write down the information of what your taste buds and nose are telling you. While taste is subjective of course it gives the buyer some great ideas.

(VCV Night Shift: Sweet

4) I want to see what YOUR recommended steeping guidelines are.
I really don't want the cop-out of well some people like it this way.. I don't care about them. If I want there opinion ill look for it. I want the creators thoughts.

5) On a similar note to #4. I want to hear what your Preferred voltage is yes yes i know taste is subjective. But when I order from a restaurant the Chef prepares it for me as his vision. If I want to mix everything up into a pile

We enjoy vapeing this at 4.9 Volts on a Standard Resistance ProTank
We feel it brings out the nutty undertones that are often missed at lower volts.

6) Blogs... Tell us about your stuff in development

So these are the thoughts on this running through my mind..
I'll be fleshing this out and finishing the website up shortly.

Yes, most of the unskilled government employees you meet when you have to ""deal with the government"" at the DMV or whatever are apathetic and surly, but the chemists, lawyers, and policy analysts at the FDA are skilled workers with a passion for what they do. (at worst, they're a little too ""ivory tower"" - not great at balancing industry needs against necessary regulation)

More importantly, and they're in a very difficult situation.

The bottom line is that the FDA is your ""enemy"" only because a) they're legally required to be, or shitty exploding batteries in their hardware.

The upshot of the uncertainty of ecig science is this: without comprehensive science and any ""smoking guns"" which would suggest ecigs are dangerous, public opinion doesn't seem to be especially against ecigs. So you guys need to keep speaking up, as calmly and rationally as possible, explaining why ecigs should remain legal!

There's not much you can do at this point, and then **send the FDA feedback when the draft regulations come out**. The draft regulations aren't gonna go into effect for 3-24 months after they are released. (huge range, I know, but it's anyone's guess) In this time, if they ban DIY, flavors, high nicotine strengths, it's up to *all of you guys* to convince them that their first draft needs some revisions. And you know what? Even if the preliminary regulations look bad

TLDR: Stop bitching about the FDA. Instead

Edit: Just wanted to add that no, the people who work there are human, and we've gotta try to work with it, though.

Wrong.

You can't stop a steam train that easy. 

Regulate juice manufacture. We'll DIY and juice vendors will adapt to selling just flavor blends with 0 nic for aroma therapy.

Regulate Hardware. I'll put a lightulb on the end of my device and sell you a swiss army flashlight

Big Pharma says it's bad for you? Yeah

Government bans import of chinese products

Let me be clear, in the long run the regulations I'm expecting will be mostly needed and perfectly reasonable. 

Even in the worst case where they call vaping just another form of smoking and say it's exactly the same as smoking, I'd still be vaping instead of smoking, I couldn't quit smoking before so I might as well do the 'other' thing that I enjoy. I mean... it's quite obviously NOT as bad as smoking, how much better is still being proven but it's pretty obvious that it's better for you :P It's cheaper unless you catch pokemon syndrome with vaping equipment and 'gotta catch em all'. 

Even if they get rid of online sales of nicotine, we'll work around it. This isn't something that can be stopped anymore than any other thing that they people want access to. Vaping is too big now, they  missed their opportunity to crush it, we have activists and extremely vocal activists at that. We've got major businesses and an entire industry growing around it and supporting a small portion of the economy, creating jobs, generating tax revenue and helping people live longer.

The FDA has announced that it intends to propose ""deeming"" regulation by April 2013 (to apply Chapter IX of FSPTCA to e-cigarettes, shisha/hookah and other tobacco products not currently subject to Chapter IX regulations) ""and to specifiy additional restrictions.""

What does this mean for you?

Sections 905 and 910 would ban all e-cigarettes

If this action does not completely destroy the industry on it's own this would be the first step in an all out attack on your ability to use electronic cigarettes. A ban on internet sales and significant taxes would almost surely follow.

This is the most significant threat to our right to vape here in the US since electronic cigarettes were introduced.

What can you do?

1. Become a member of CASAA (The Consumer Advocates For Smoke-Free Alternatives Association) - http://casaa.org/Become_a_Member.html . CASAA is the voice of the vaping community at the numerous public hearings and meetings that have been held with the FDA.

We are currently revamping our software UI, but I think one issue with that is setting the V/W ceiling manually might burn out an atomizer and the company might think that's a liability.

So my friend had a Vaporizer when I went over his house one day. I had no idea why since he doesn't smoke. When he told me that it has no tobacco, it isn't just the Nicotine or whatever that calms them down, it's the breathing. My anxiety has caused me to be a shallow breather and it only makes things worse. The e-cig helps for me to practice my breathing and I get a neat peach flavor for it :). 

There was one instance where I was very close to passing out recently. I used my e-cig to do my breathing and I beat it. I never leave home without it and I'm very grateful to have it.

I'm gonna go with 1. 

You quoted the policy on my site about warranty. That's there to make the CC processor smile, etc. I don't even ask questions, if it didn't work as long as I feel it should work, I replace it, exchange it, or refund it. I've never declined a customer even when it was obviously their fault... 

As an example

Every twist I sell, she told me it didn't have any buttons except the fire button... it was probably just off. I replaced it. 

I sent out 4 packages today to take care of customers, meant to order another, asked if I could exchange it, I just sent him the new wire. I'm not sayin I make a habit of giving out free stuff (don't ask for free stuff people :P ) but I take care of my customers on a case by case basis and I've only ever had one person remain unhappy with me after the encounter and that person just couldn't be pleased.

An abundance of imagery on any subreddit can be detrimental for those who prefer reddit to serve as a community driven filter for news

reddit's original intended purpose was as a link aggregator – a 'best of' for the internet. That's the reddit I joined. Self posts and even comments were introduced later. When they then introduced subreddits to separate content, someone posted a link to an informative post on ecf and worried whether it it was allowed here. I was surprised they didn't know that's was the point of reddit. We link to everything. If you are reading another e-cig related site and you see something interesting, link to it. 

This subreddit also became a resource for help and support

These days pictures are a dominant force on a lot of subreddits who haven't done something to curb them. I think the proliferation of smart phones and easy image hosts are a big part of the reason they became so dominant. A lot of drama can arise on subreddits which have attempted to curb image posts and I'm hoping the rules I implement are soft enough not to cause a furore. I don't want to remove images completely from the subreddit obviously. A lot of images can be beneficial and informative so it is difficult to decide on rules that won't choke the subreddit either.

*****

So here's what I'm going to do for now (and all this is experimental and subject to change/adjustment):

From now on Vape Mail must be posted in designated Daily Vape Mail threads. These threads will commence each day at midnight

Pictures of unusual

To find each day's daily vape mail thread if it's not readily apparent you can click the menu button in the header and select 'vape mail' and you should be able to more easily find it. This will bring you to all the latest posts tagged with the 'vape mail' flair.

Memes and 'my face when' type posts can no longer be posted here. I originally allowed these because we don't get that many but I think removing them sets a tone as to the kind of content I'd prefer.

Recently I've noticed more and more people posting pictures of themselves using their e-cigs whether it is in their car or at work or in the armchair watching tv. I can see these becoming a problem too. I'm considering asking for the more ordinary ones be posted in the daily vape mail threads but I'm not sure if they fit. 

I'll leave them be for now. I'm considering calling the thread the 'Daily Vape Pics round-up thread' and giving these dailys their own separate flair. Vape mail was never a good name in the first place because you may buy your gear in B&amp;Ms but that's what caught on. 

The first daily vape mail thread will start tomorrow at midnight PST.

1354706647.0,14bgoh,"So many positive reviews of vendors lately. Here's a negative one, Juicy Vapor has shitty customer service.",SirTimmyTimbit,184,43,http://www.reddit.com/r/electronic_cigarette/comments/14bgoh/so_many_positive_reviews_of_vendors_lately_heres/

I put a bottle of Ecto Plasma in the cart and at checkout I chose free first class shipping as the shipping method. The order went through and my card was charged.

Two days later I receive an email from Tyler at Juicy Vapor saying there was a glitch on the system and the coupon code should not have worked. I have to pay for shipping.

According to their TOS they are not responsible for mishaps like this and if I wanted the bottle I had to pay for the shipping. The other alternative was a refund and I eventually took it.

Here are my gripes with that:

* The vaping community is one of the most kindest and most generous I've ever come across. Look at this community for example

    We have instances where vendors like iVape sends a broke guy free juice. We have Indigo Vapor who contacted customers after they had received their juice and offered to replace it because it was not up to their standards. Vape Dudes upsized every order because their processing time was slow. **Those mentioned above and in many other occasions we have vendors who went above and beyond the call of duty**. They bore the cost of their mistake and even when it wasn't a mistake they still ensured the customer received very good service.

    That's the kind of ecosystem I'd like to see vaping become a part of. **Juicy Vapor seems to be all about the money** and not so much about helping people. 

    They charge $4 for processing orders and their juice is one of the most expansive out there at $21 per 30ml. **They are a big vendor charging premium prices while providing less of a customer support than what the little guys are offering.** 

    **This is not the kind of business I want to support

* ***At no point in our conversation did they offer to discount the price of the juice I ordered and nor did they offer to split the shipping cost with me since the mistake was on their end.*** It was simply I either pay them the full price of juice + full price of shipping or a refund. I don't know much about cost of a bottle of juice

They could have gotten a potential new regular

1365696744.0,1c54cd,PSA: Educate yourself with more than what you read on social networks.,SteamMonkey,168,29,45,"I try

There are a HUGE number of misinformed individuals who perpetuate that misinformation throughout the interwebs. 

If you're messing with batteries, like... look up REAL info from a respectable source. 

baterry university is one spot for that. 

If you're messing with a new material, SS rope, SS mesh, kanthal, nichrome, etc... research the product. These things are made by some one and theres a sheet out there with a LOT of info on anything you can imagine. 

A couple of examples:

SS Mesh, 316? Do you know the differences? 

Silica vs Fiberglass

XC-116

Another thing that concerns me is the trend towards ""mechanical mods"" and ""Low ohm omgvaporclouds"" coils. I'm not sayin it's dangerous but it can be if you don't know what you're doing. Dangerous to your health or your wallet. 

If you run a non LiMn or otehr ""IMR"" style battery beyond it's capability you can fry it, mechanical function, material sciences, etc). 

I wish I had time to sit down and take all of the information i've gathered over the last couple of years and put it in one spot in various guides but I don't at the moment. It's on my list of things to do but in the mean time... 

Please, not even from me or slumberland, or any of the other folks that are sorta 'known' sources for information. Educate yourself, it's your wallet, its your health that's at risk if you do something blind. 

I'm going to do a weekly QA thread over on /r/steammonkey/ every friday starting tomorrow. I'll put a particular topic in the post header and that's what we'll talk about. I'll share what information I have as well as sources for that info and I'll try to get some folks that are knowledgeable about subjects I'm not or just to get a second set of eyes. 

I invite you, ask but please, go out and try to find that info yourself as well. 

This isn't just about your personal health and finances

Emailed research doctors and got response.,nksmith86,160,22,77,"Some time ago I commented on a users thread stating that I would contact some of the research doctors at my University and inquire about research relating to the types of ""e-cigs"" most of us use. I got a response last week and finally got around to posting it. Below I have copy pasted the email chain and a link to the publication I was emailed will be at the bottom.

Dr. Eissenburg

Good afternoon, I came across you in the directory and decided to shoot you an email. First, I hope this email reaches you in good health and I apologize if this email comes at a bad time or if it is better suited for another department or faculty member.

I have been reading through studies that have been conducted during the last few years and they all had two things in common. The studies were inconclusive as to whether or not e-cigs can lead to smoking cessation and questioned the method of delivery. I am sure that you are aware that electronic nicotine delivery devices are becoming increasing more popular especially with big tobacco looking to keep up with the trending population. I am writing because I believe the studies lacked several key elements and I am curious as to whether or not any studies are currently underway. 

The biggest fault with the e-cig studies was delivery method. The ""cig-a-like"" variations that can be purchased at gas stations and retail stores are extremely unreliable, I was quickly turned off. The taste alone was enough to make me never want to pick it up again. At this point I was smoking 3-4 hookah's a day and needed to stop entirely. I was introduced to a personal vaporizer system unlike anything being sold in most retail stores. The device I received allowed me to choose from endless flavors, battery sizes, atomizers and nicotine strength. All of these variations are of equal importance. Being able to choose a flavor like ""Honey Peary,"" a honeydew melon, pear and strawberry blend, customize its nicotine strength and vaporize with a completely custom PV, but also allowed me to literally step down from 18mg of nicotine (.18% per mL) to 0mg in one month. The nicotine solution (juice) is made of propylene glycol and vegetable glycerin (pg/vg)

So what am I saying? Smoking as you very well know, (PV users) have a prefered juice flavor, nicotine strength, pg/vg ratio and delivery device. All that I have come into contact with, this number being in the hundreds and possible thousands have successfully quit smoking. Many haven't touched a cigarette since day one of using their PV. 

I have included in this email a link to a photo album of my PV's and juice on imgur

I try to get their attention because all of them are smokers.  I always bring a little baggy of new tips in with me just in case someone asks to try it.  Tonight

This particular fellow was curious because he absolutely loved the smell of my Honey Pearry.  I told him that if he really wanted to try it, the kid only makes minimum wage and works like 30 hours a week supporting himself and his girlfriend.  I told him about the benefits of switching and the cost effectiveness and that also piqued his interest.  But, I know what it's like when money is tight and I knew there was probably no chance this guy would ever take the plunge and buy a new kit for himself.  So, I reached into my grab bag.  I set him up with a Tube Tank DCT, my eGo-V w/charging cable, and topped him off with some good ol' charlie flavored tobacco juice (he was a Pall Mall fan).  Within seconds, his face lit up like a kid on Christmas and he spent the last 30 minutes of his visit with me just chain vaping and making ridiculous clouds of vape on his new toy.  Right before he left

It was hard letting go of my cheap emergency backup.  But it was so easy knowing that I may have very well saved someone's life.  This was a wholesome experience for me that I'll never forget.  (And yes

Tomorrow I'll be bring him in a full bottle of some more Ol' Charlie juice and a sample of the Honey Pearry (the 30ml's are MINE I TELL YOU....MIIIIIINE).  I'll try to get a picture of him vaping with it and I'll post it here,False,self,t5_2qmlu,False,,current,t3_1dbqju

In October/November, bottle by bottle - no batches. I do all of the customer service, order fulfillment and online items. So, when we got slammed with orders, we got behind. We didn't know what to do - close? Wouldn't that short change people that wanted to order? We kept trying to keep up - working 16 hours a day, 7 days a week. Finally, we decided to close to focus on all outstanding orders and to reset. We did this because we care deeply about our business and our customers.

Vaping is all about finding what YOU enjoy. If you are satisfied with a cig-a-like

___________________________

After another AskReddit thread with mentions of /r/electronic_cigarette, but it seems like most of them are a bit ""outdated"". So here we go, this is my attempt at one.

Quick note beforehand - These are my own recommendations. If anyone has any more, I am *not* advertising any specific vendors other than one or two that carry said kit exclusively. If you do some googling, you could probably find what I'm linking at a much cheaper price.

**CIG-A-LIKE KIT**

So, I would recommend the [Panda Evolve Starter Kit](http://www.pandaecigs.com/Panda-Evolve-Kit-p/evolvekit.htm). It has (from what I have seen and heard) the best performance you're going to get out of a cig-a-like battery. It comes with two ""micromizers"" (small clearomizers. We'll discuss these in a moment) that hold/vaporize your juice for you. I recommend grabbing a few more of these as two probably won't last you all that long. I've also heard that their juice is very.. ""meh"". Just average. Try it and by all means, if you like it, keep using it. But if you get some and aren't a fan, there is a *lot* of other juice out there to try. Don't get discouraged.

Almost forgot - This battery is AUTOMATIC. This means you puff on it and it fires for you. Just put it in your mouth and ""smoke"" it. The majority of other devices are manual, hands free.

**THE EGO**

The eGo is what most would consider the next step up from a cig-a-like battery, better performance, and can use many more *omizers (again, we'll talk about those in a moment). Some even have variable voltage. VV devices allow you to adjust how much power is going through your coil, allowing you to find a sweet spot for each juice and *omizer you use. [Here is an eGo C Twist](http://ivape.net/index.php/1000mAh-Joye-eGo-C-Twist-White.html). This is 1000mAh (battery capacity) and has a dial on the bottom allowing you to adjust your voltage from 3.2 to 4.8. [Here is a Vision Spinner](http://www.myvaporstore.com/Vision_Spinner_VV_eGo_Battery_1300mAh_p/vs-s1300.htm). It has 1300mAh and many prefer the dial on it over the Twist. Up to you, really.

**FLASHLIGHTS**

Time for mods! The first set of mods were originally created by vapers out of flashlights, if you want a mod right off the start, my personal recommendation would be the [Vamo](http://www.okcvapes.com/vamo-variable-wattage-voltage/). OKCVapes is not the cheapest place for a Vamo, BUT it is one of the only places that allow you to make a kit with your Vamo. Much easier for new vapers. The Vamo uses 18650 batteries (high mAh, one will last at least an entire day. More if you vape less than me, which is likely), has variable voltage AND variable wattage, but when my friend wanted to get into vaping, trust me! Fully charged battery lasts two or three days from all the tales I've heard

**OMIZERS**

*Omizers! Woo! This is gonna be fun. This refers to atomizers, micromizers, cartomizer tanks, etc etc etc etc. There are a lot of these. For a better explanation of all of these, [SteamMonkey did a great thread on them](http://www.reddit.com/r/electronic_cigarette/comments/1dshxl/monkey_university_562013_clearos_and_cartos_and/). 

So

eGo Style Clearo - These only fit on an eGo or eGo threaded device because of the ""skirt"" at the bottom. I would recommend the [iClear 16](http://www.vapingme.com/iclear-16-4-wick-dual-coil-1-6ml-clearomizer-ce5-colors/) or the [Kanger EVOD](http://www.myvaporstore.com/Kanger_EVOD_eGO_Bottom_Coil_Clearomizer_p/krev.htm). The iClear is dual coil with four wicks. This is good. However

Regular clearo - I'm not a huge fan of clearos. However

Don't forget that all the clearomizers I've mentioned up there have replaceable heads. This makes swapping flavors easy and anytime the head in there now gets old and burned up

Carto - VaporBeast has [15 great quality cartos for a great price](http://www.vaporbeast.com/15_Boge_Carto_Steal_p/bc15.htm). This is all I recommend. Others will recommend other cartos

Atomizer - These are for dripping. This is the best flavor and vapor you'll get out of the things I listed. However, dripping, vaping, so on and so on and so on. I always keep a good atomiezr around for testing flavors before I fill up a clearo or something with them. If you want a high quality, great performance atty, try out the [HH357 Long Barrel](http://www.avidvaper.com/hh-357-long-barrel-hybrid-510-atomizer/). It is a great atomizer but it is a bit more expensive. However, it will last a long time. If you want a cheaper atomizer to use

**JUICESSSSSS**

This is a though one. There are so many juices out there. However

But first - TASTE IS SUBJECTIVE. One juice that tastes incredible to someone else may taste like hell to you. Try many juices. Don't just stick to what people tell you to try. 

[MountBakerVapor](http://www.mtbakervapor.com/) - These guys are great to start with. They're the cheapest prices on juice you'll find anywhere. There are loads of flavors to try and because they're so cheap

[TastyVapor](http://www.tastyvapor.us/) - You won't see these guys mentioned here much. This is the first vendor I ordered juice from and I actually ordered exclusively from them for nearly a full year. They're great. They have fantastic customer service and great flavors. What you order is what you get. You want Ultimate Vanilla? You can be damn sure that what you get is ""Ultimate Vanilla"", and mix them together to your nic level. Bam! Loads of juice for cheap.

[The Vapor Chef](http://thevaporchef.com/) - Ugh. TVC is considered ""gourmet juice"". This stuff is fantastic and every flavor I've tried from him has been perfection. Honey Pearry is hugely popular here and I'd recommend it. However

1364183084.0,1ayd7s,I want this to be my life.,SteamMonkey,154,20,64,"I'm a newish vendor and thanks mostly to you fine folks here on the reddit

If you follow me you probably know I work a day job as well as run the store. I planned on the store being my full time thing one day but I always expected it to take a year or more to get there. Right nwo it looks like it might. 

This is sort of a personal rant/narrative about my journey so far as a vendor which may be completely boring to most of you so here's teh TLDR in advance :p 

I want this to be my full time job NOW not in a year


Now for the ~~masochistic~~ interested people...

I started planning this store completely different. Initially it was called Redbeards Locker and it was going to be a mod consignment shop and retail outlet for my personal designs. I've been working on a mech mod, RBA, bottom feeder and a juice carrier. I spent months working on my designs, sunk a bunch of money into trying to prototype and make them myself and eventually ran into a financial brick wall.

My initial goals were to start an american made store with all american made products and I was failing because I just couldn't fund the prototyping of these devices and to get the quality I wanted out of them they just couldn't be made in my home shop on my little ghetto CNC and lathe. I was bitchin about it one night with my inlaws when they said ""Just sell the chinese crap until you make enough money to build your american stuff."" I sorta had a head slapping moment... why not?

So I knew right away that I wasn't going to carry anything I wouldn't use myself or recommend to friends/family members but I also knew I was limited in scope on what I had used. I was a carto tank guy who liked to futz around with RBAs. What about these vivi novas and T3s and other random doodads that all the kids were talkin about? So I bought up a bunch of crap

I was playing around one night with Gimp2 trying to make a logo for Redbeards Locker and decided I looked sorta monkey like IRL so why not make a money with goggles and a big beard... I couldn't get the beard right but the monkey looked pretty cool. I saw him and just out of no where Steam Monkey came to mind

I registered Steam Monkey and negotiated for a couple of months with various vendors. Bought about 3k in stuff (the other 2k went to business registration

That's when shit got real... I was anticipating it taking months to get even enough business to keep myself busy. I marketed, etc. Suddenly I couldn't keep crap on the shelves. Due to my prices and all the extra stuff I throw into every order, my RBA goody bags, expensive (relatively) packaging to ensure everyone gets what they ordered intact and unmolested, I was never really able to flip orders from china fast enough to NOT be out of stock on crap. 

I've been growing but it's slow. I could trim some 'fat' so to speak in different places which would let me grow faster but I just can't do it. Things like the indestructo mailers I use and fortune cookies and goodie bags are just part of what Steam Monkey is

I'm going through the motions of putting some formal loan proposals in front of lenders to try and get a chunk of change to get ahead of the curve and push harder on my development of new products, etc. I've officially checked out of my day job but I still go, do my work and come home like the good little corporate cog I am. I just don't wanna do it anymore. 

I want my life to be serving the vaping community

best of all... I've got an awesome community of folks to service... I mean, more civil than most internet communities, and pretty damn good at self regulating. It's weird... lol.

1369076145.0,1epl4o,VaporRater's Guide to Dripping (WARNING: Wall of text doesn't even begin to cover it),VaporRater,148,22,64,"With the recent influx of subscribers

Back when I began vaping, lipton pyramid tea bags, and blue aquarium foam (oh, the memories!), among other random items. As it turned out, many of us ended up skipping the filler altogether and dripping straight into our atomizers...thus direct dripping was born.

Compared to today's PVs and *-omizers, when it comes to the truest, most intense flavors, the biggest throat hit, and most voluminous vapor production, aside from RBA/RDAs, there is simply nothing better.

###The Equipment

* a battery/mod -- could be as small as a 510/901 cig-a-like
* your dripping atomizer (I prefer bridgless)
* drip tip
* drip shield &amp; 510-510 shorty adapter (optional)

##Battery

This part of this equation should be simple enough (if you're not sure of your threading

##Atomizer

The real question is how much $$ do you want to spend.

Want to just try out dripping? I like [these little 3 hole drippers](http://www.valuevapor.com/VV/store/index.php?main_page=product_info&amp;cPath=79&amp;products_id=504) for $5/ea. They function well

Want something a little higher quality? [These Vapage AMG attys at $9/ea](http://www.vapage.com/AMG_Hybrid_Universal_2_pack_p/vpa-052-054.htm#) are the ones I use for all my [juice reviews](http://www.VaporRater.com). They produce excellent flavor, I have found nothing better, and believe me, I've looked.

Want to dive in head first and have cash burning a hole in your pocket? Everyone loves to rave about the [HH.357](http://www.avidvaper.com/hh-357-long-barrel-hybrid-510-atomizer/). Is it a good atomizer? You bet your ass it is...is it $22 worth of good, but vaping is all about personal opinions, so maybe it's $22 worth of good to you. As with almost everything vaping related, the old adage YMMV always applies.

##Drip Shield

Now that you've got yourself a dripping atty, an [Empire](http://www.empiremods.com/category_s/21.htm), which are of a higher quality and more intricately designed. The shields serve several purposes...they will stop leaks, keep your atty cooler by acting as a heat sink, and will affect the draw depending on the original draw of your atty. If you overfill your atty, the juice will puddle near the lower o-ring of the shield, and can be easily pulled back in when the atty is getting dry, but anymore than a few extra drops could lead to flooding of the entire set-up. Some folks love the shields (like myself)

##Adapter

Because shields were originally intended for 901 attys which are longer than a 510, et al) others do not (ProVari). Unless you are using a bottom feeder mod, you would want the sealed adapter to ensure against leaking. 

###How to Drip

This is as easy as it gets. You can either drip straight down your drip tip, depending on which type you choose, can usually hold anywhere from 5 drops to 12 or more as the mesh absorbs the juice. When you start to taste the atty going dry, add 3-7 drops (again, depending on the atty) and vape away. Drip shields do allow you to drip freely w/o worrying about flooding your atty, but it is possible to overfill past the shields capacity as well, so don't overdo it.

The whole process of drip, but for me, and many others, this has become part of the ritual. For others it's still a PITA, but worth it for the intense flavor and overall superior vape vs cartos and clearos, but again this is all very personal and something you have to decide for yourself.

###Atomizer cleaning

(**Do this at your own risk--not recommended for cleaning HH.357 which should only be soaked in PGA**) 

Just like the coils on any *omizer, but this is how I do it, and it has never failed to bring an atomizer back to almost brand new.

* blow air thru your atty **from the connector end**. Do this into a papertowel

* When all the old juice is removed connect the atty to a device

* Fire the atty, never for longer than a few seconds. As soon as the entire coil begins to glow during the firing process, slow it down, and gently blow air into the atty to cool it down a bit. Continue this process until the gunk on your coil is no longer being burned off and you're only seeing the glowing coil, no more or very little smoke. **Do not hold down the fire button for more than a second or two at a time, you will pop the coil.**

* When the coil is fairly clean (and the atty is cool enough to touch), starting with blowing out the water. **You do not need to wait for the atty to dry if you blow all of it out.** The remainder will steam away and help to remove even more gunk the next time around, similar to deglazing a pan. You may need to repeat the whole process several times or more for a very dirty coil.

* The final step is optional

You may very well pop a few coils while getting the hang of it

That's all there is to it...

Ignore that

What does it mean to you? 

Currently there are no less than 9 major organizations, Ecigs, or other vaious names, are being pushed into multiple existing categories. 

These categories are not good for us. If they become tobacco products, remove all non tobacco flavored E-liquids, remove the ability to ship E-liquid via USPS (another cost increase) and raise taxes to the point that you'll be back to paying the ridiculous prices you used to pay for cigarettes. 

The other category they're looking at in multiple locales is a medical product or 'drug delivery system'. This has already been squashed in the US but it applies to many other plots of dirt around the globe. This will hit the producers of e-liquid and hardware in ways that are hard to measure but we know it'll hit hard. The entire industry could change. 

So

I want to build a social awareness program for NVs around the concept that these are NOT Cigarettes or tobacco. They are NOT smoking cessation aids/drugs. This is a new category of product. It doesn't happen often that something hits the market that cannot be easily filed away into one of the existing regulatory ""bins"". This is one of those situations. 

It's time to start treating this as a separate product

PV ties to illicit drug use. 
E-cig ties to cigarette and tobacco.

E-liquid and E-juice are perfectly viable names for our liquids, it's catchy, and it's part of the campaign. 

The ultimate goal here is to effect a change in public perception

I will be driving this campaign with or without support. It will include media

I will be posting links to supporting articles and studies relating to our hobby. I will be posting Monkey U's on 'what an NV is' and I will be contacting as many industry experts and advocates to support the concept. It's starting here though... 

I firmly believe that the Reddit community is one of the strongest and most capable communities out there. If we lead the pack on this it will happen. 

We have time, there is support for us within the FDA along this path. The opposition is big tobacco, anti smoking nazis, and the pharmaceutical industry.... basically people with something to lose financially or with misguided moral agendas. 

Stay tuned here for more detail. The beneficial economic and public health effects of NV's blossoming as an industry are undeniable,False,self,t5_2qmlu,1374172393.0,,,t3_1ikebo

My Reply:

I changed the subject to (""Smokeless"" cigarette ""issue"") lol

&gt;All

&gt;As a long time user of an ‘electronic cigarette, I have had a few run-ins with confused individuals over my activity with an ‘electronic cigarette’ (from here on referred to as simply PV for personal vaporizer). I have never found myself in a facility with an outright ban on them, nor have I ever been removed from an indoor area for ‘vaping’ (vaporizing).

&gt;In my experience, and rarely do any research. I am here to assist in this regard, providing both personal experience and actual scientific studies that have been published, both in the past, and recently.

&gt;First

&gt;Chapter 3794: SMOKING BAN
(A)	""Smoking"" means inhaling, or carrying any lighted cigar, cigarette, pipe, or other lighted smoking device for burning tobacco or any other plant. ""Smoking"" does not include the burning of incense in a religious ceremony.

&gt;This will be referred to later. Please note the crystal clear definition of what smoking is. 

&gt;An electronic cigarette, advanced personal vaporizer, digital cigarette, electronic nicotine delivery system; no matter what one calls them, they all refer to the same thing. That item being a battery powered vaporizer (atomizer) which is used to vaporize a fluid (often referred to simply as juice) comprised of three simple ingredients: propylene glycol and/or vegetable glycerine (the former is used in fog machines, deemed perfectly safe by the FDA, the latter is used in all manners of food, flavoring (food grade, which heats up to between 150 and 300 degrees Fahrenheit, as there is a very clear difference between it and smoking. Please refer to the snippet of Ohio revised code at this time. The user will exhale

&gt;Now that one has loosely educated on how a PV works, and have so far come up with with nothing suggesting that a PV is unsafe for its user, much less anyone in the vicinity. They have found that, since the device uses vapor, it is absorbed almost instantly by oral glands, often times not even requiring inhalation. The user then will exhale nothing but water vapor, which dissipates into the atmosphere in under 15 seconds. It has been shown that any residual nicotine left in the vapor cloud has a half-life of about 11 seconds. Compare this to the half-life of cigarette smoke, sorry it is mostly French). Of course

&gt;[Here is a very recent cytotoxicity report on PV usage.](http://informahealthcare.com/doi/abs/10.3109/08958378.2013.793439) This report shows that, and that particular one was at least 20 orders of magnitude less toxic than a traditional cigarette. The team surmised that this toxicity came from a bad batch of flavoring, as the other fluids tested in the study were similar in nature, but of different flavors. Currently, the only known danger with a PV is possible nicotine overdose caused by the nicotine level of a juice being too high, purposefully ingesting a large amount of juice, or coming in contact with a very high dilution of nicotine fluid meant for cutting to a lower dilution (which is not available for purchase in normal stores). Taking the point further, and just for the taste. In fact

&gt;Speaking of nicotine and caffeine:
“[Nicotine is] only slightly more dangerous than caffeine
See the following DOI's: 10.1111/j.1468-1331.2007.01949.x

&gt;To sum up, by using a PV. Compare this to traditional cigarettes, which have a staggering amount of additives, cancer causing agents, toxic elements, and even cause health problems for bystanders. I implore you all to please do your homework and come up with your own solution to this. Stay out of the politics of the situation, as usual

&gt;With that all said, I spent hours researching them. The next day I ordered my very first one, and when it arrived, I immediately quit smoking cigarettes. Within a week, the garbage that comes with tobacco had all left my system and I felt magnificent. I could breathe again. I could taste again. I wasn’t coughing my lungs up every morning. This also led into and assisted my weight loss efforts, eventually shedding 135 pounds in 18 months. That is an entirely separate story, but just read that again and try to tell me vaporized nicotine is bad for you.

&gt;After using a PV for a few years, before occasionally ‘bumming’ a cigarette. Six months later, I was back to buying cigarettes (this job, I tell ya! Haha j/k). I didn’t want to smoke, and was having a hard time quitting, so grabbed a disposable PV from a gas station. Here was when I realized how much I missed the increased alertness nicotine provided me, as well as how it helps me wake up in the morning, and this time around

&gt;I have not recently, and today I have brought with me cinna-bun and gummy bear. The man sitting to my left earlier told me how fruity and good the gummy bear vapor smelled. Then, five minutes later, made a comment about the less than satisfactory scent of the canned tuna I am eating. From this, I have drawn the conclusion that my eating habits are more disruptive to my coworkers than my vaping habits.

&gt;Just let me know if there is any more information I can provide or any questions I can answer.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I ask every patient I see if they smoke - for how long, and tell me how much. For about the past few months, there has been a complete sea change where I imagine about 85% of the smokers, after telling me they smoke, quickly add that they are trying to quit. Then I ask what they are doing to quit, and they say, ""Vaping."" I did not even know what it was a while back. But at first I was delighted that this new invention was helping so many people quit.

However, but I follow up on questions now. I ask, ""How many packs per day now?"" And I ask, ""How often are you vaping?"" I find that the vast majority have not declined in cigarette consumption, and if so by slim margins, but have drastically increased in vaping. Not only that, but some have transitioned to simply using e-smoking as a method to smoke inside buildings.

So you who have had a success with these
Have any of you relapsed and now smoke (cigarettes/vapor) more than you had before vaping?

Another startling aspect is I often enter my examination room and the patient is in the middle of vaping. I wasn't sure what to think of this at first

What do you think of this rule? Does it make you angry and why?

Lastly

Have you noticed any new symptoms since beginning vaping? New cough? Runny nose? Shortness of breath? A constant want or need to vape? Any burning sensations?

Have you noticed the flavorings/chemicals having any ill effect on your e-device itself?

Responses would be much appreciated.

&gt;To whomever it may concern

&gt;I have just read an article on the KXAN news site about the smoking ban on all Travis county properties. Included in this article is a mention that this ban extends to include electronic cigarettes. Personally

&gt;Electronic cigarettes have been a godsend for me. After years of unsuccessful attempts at quitting smoking, are my days of labored breathing, coughing, congestion, sore throats every morning, yellowed finger tips, bad breath, smelly clothes - the list goes on. I even ran three miles two days ago

&gt;I have watched e-cigarettes transform for the better the lives of six other friends of mine in Austin alone

&gt;These people deserve this chance. Many have already tried the patch, and plenty of other smoking cessation methods, without success. However, you have now set a precedent that is going to lump those products in with a far worse product - a proven killer which we are all trying to evade. 

&gt;I would urge you to reconsider this ban

&gt;Please

&gt;Great points. I for one will re-look at this ban on the electronic cigarettes. Thanks for the message.

The owner returned a few seconds later and I began explaining my story again. He interrupted me and told me that I must have been using it wrong, he wasn't liable.

I then tried to make an analogy to another product such as a car, ""Leave. Get out. You're and asshole and don't ever come back.""

Ever since I placed the original order I started lurking here and reading and researching as much as I could and I started to really think about the possibility of actually quitting. The one thing that really had me worried was my wife. She has been a pack a day smoker for about 16 years (I was a pack a day for 18y years) and she is so stubborn, but pile on an unhealthy dose of anxiety on top of it. Not fun. Well, after seeing the freebie from Panda, and a bit of hype on my part(and I went to the store and bought us a couple of those Blu's), she, VERY reluctantly, gave in and we each got our own styles of starter kits. I got the eGo kit from Panda and she got an RN4081 cigalike kit from AquaVaporCig.com.

All our stuff got here on Friday evening

Let me tell you... I am amazed. One day with this thing and I have little to no craving for an analog. Same for her

We stopped on the way back into town and I bought a carto tank and a 30ml bottle of pomegranate juice(amazing) from a local B&amp;M(way too expensive and I probably won't go back too often, and I feel bad about this but I am on a budget). This morning we saw the 50% coupon code for the Panda Evolve kit and jumped on it. Now she's sitting on her tablet and browsing juice sites more more stuff. This is insanity.

So, I owe you all a big, hairy bear hug.

THANK YOU!

I've been a bit uppity lately. That's gonna stop. My stress levels are through the roof for a variety of reasons and as such

I've always been a confident person, or my ways were better, or that I played down your personal preferences in any way, shape, or form. I apologize. 

I'm here for the vapers and the vaping community. I started my business because I wanted to get in the game and try to make a difference. I believe, help save lives, help make people smell better, and make everything safer, easier, and more cost effective when it comes to vaping in general. Those are my goals, there are a million paths to those goals and I lost sight of the fact that people not on the path I prefer are also moving towards the same goals and shouldn't be hindered or in any way judged. 

I love this place

The below issue has been completely, remarkably professional, and perhaps one of the most forthcoming and honest admittance I've ever seen. The people at Vaporskinz apparently care very much about the way in which they conduct themselves and, by their actions here alone, I appreciate the reputation they strive to maintain.

If that is the case, what you're doing is *not acceptable*.

Through this sub I found a ton of health research information, people's personal experiences with quitting analogs through vaping etc... and it all was a great source of support and guidance.

1356899283.0,15oq5z,In honor of my cake day - here are some answers to questions asked here all of the time...,thedub412,137,32,49,"1.) You got a starter kit from a reputable website?  You did fine... seriously.  Most kits are a CE type clearo and an eGo style batt - and come with a bottle of juice.  That's good stuff right there and it will work.

2.) T3's are great... until they suck... or you don't and they gurgle.  The wicks degrade and juice gets below the coil/wick assembly into what is a little reservoir that is needed for the eGo connection.  Tip that bitch while vaping to get the juice towards the coil wick and it will burn up the remaining juice.  There's your fix.

3.) We have flair on this sub - use it - I was a major proponent for vapemail at one point in time

4.) If you ask for a juice vendor - it's gonna be MBV here.  That's www.mtbakervapor.com.  I recommend the Banana's Gone Nuts.  

5.) Vendors post here, saying ""Hey, I ordered a week ago, and my shipping confirmation hasn't been sent out yet, what's up so and so vendor"" will most likely get you a great deal of help and contact information.

6.) Pretty much everyone has a VAMO now.  Yes

7.) Slumberland has good RBA's.  If you are going to buy one from ANYONE and all you have is an eGo battery with no way to test resistance?  You're gonna have a bad time.  Get a multimeter or a mod that can at least show your resistance.

8.) You're probably going to get liquid on your connector at some point in time.  Some Iso alcohol on a q-tip will fix ya up.  They are sealed

9.) Provari.  That's it and all I am saying about it.

10.) Check out the chat room if you haven't - there are a ton of knowledgeable people there that can help you out pretty much on-demand.  

11.) You don't know if XYZ website is good to order from?  Use the search function or.... check out the handy links on the sidebar - there's a [ton](http://www.reddit.com/r/electronic_cigarette/comments/eyc23/ecig_guides_help_and_suggestions/) of information - like [vendors](http://www.reddit.com/r/electronic_cigarette/comments/tjpxb/reddits_recommended_ecig_supplier_list_thread_2/) and even [mods](http://www.reddit.com/r/electronic_cigarette/comments/fk2zx/a_list_of_ecig_mods/)!

12.) Here's a link on juices that are KNOWN to crack tanks and cloud them.  Use at your own risk.  [Awesome ECF thread on juices that crack and cloud tanks and updated as need be by awesome ECF member my4jewels](http://www.e-cigarette-forum.com/forum/tanks/219179-lets-make-list-juices-flavors-crack-tanks-ce2s-clearos-33.html#post8158663)

13.) Terms got ya down?  Here's a quick run down - 

* PV - Personal Vaporizer
* TH - Throat Hit
* VV/VW - Variable voltage/Variable Wattage
* Analogs/Logs - REAL Cigs
* Atty - Atomizer - this is what heats up the juice and turns it into vapor
* Clearomizer or Clearo - Tank with a wicking structure that stores juice - the atomizer is built into this device
* Cartomizer or carto tank - Tank you insert a cartomizer
* RBA - Rebuildable atomizer - it's an atomizer or tank that YOU build and coil and wick
* SS mesh - Stainless steel mesh - an advanced wicking material
* MOD - Advanced PV
* Silica - this is the wick that comes standard in most clearos
* Ceramic - There are actually two different ways this is used in the vaping world.  One

14.) This infographic is probably the best thing to look at when you are starting.  It's in the stickies

And last - this hobby is what you make of it.  You have an eGo C-Twist or a spinner and a nova and you are happy with it? It does what you want it to? Then fuck yeah, some of us are happy DIY-ing, some with RBA's and modding.  This isn't just a replacement now for most vapers - it's a hobby that you build upon and learn and make it what you want it to be.  Enjoy it, enjoy the community we have here and be respectful to everyone's opinions and ways of doing things, you'll probably learn something

If I left something out or you just wanna tell me anything - leave something here or I am in chat at night usually.  Anything at all - some things like ""Dub - you are awesome"" or ""Did vaping get you so ridiculously good looking or were you just born that way""

TL;DR - I'm a whore and it's my cakeday :)

I know I'm not the only who thinks that it is a waste of time and is taking away one of the main social aspects of this community. Now I apologize if this rant is shit

That being the new vapers. Now, how they're doing after a few hours/days. I know it's very limited to what they're going to show us, but hey c'mon it's still fun. It also allows for us to suggest different *omizers and juices. Without that information some might get bored and fall back to smoking (a possibility none the less).

Moving away from the new guys and onto the 'experienced' or 'veterans' if you may, why not?  I think that's all I have to say about that segment.

Now this whole 'Special' vape mail exception to the ban-- yes I'm calling it a ban-- what actually classifies. I seen a vape mail post the other day about Pluid- which was deleted. Now correct me if I'm wrong but getting Pluid is nearly impossible, I'm still new to all this so perhaps I'm not well versed in what is special in the vaping world.

As you might have guessed

EDIT^3 It has recently been brought to my attention that a sub called /r/E_Cigarette exists

EDIT^2 It has been suggested by /u/Roast_A_Botch that we make vape mail a self post only and include the flair. I wholeheartedly agree with this. For a compromise

&gt; 
&gt;Background
&gt; 
&gt;The Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act (Tobacco Act) was structured to regulate cigarettes
&gt; 
&gt;The concept of Tobacco Harm Reduction (THR) was introduced in Section 911 of the Tobacco Act
&gt; 
&gt;Currently
&gt;(1.) Designating products for fast-track research and approval within the meaning of Sec. 506 (See § 356. Fast track products http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/USCODE-2010-title21/pdf/USCODE-2010-title21-chap9-subchapV-partA-sec356.pdf.)
&gt;(2.) Extended use of NRPs
&gt;(3.) Additional indications for NRPs
&gt; 
&gt;Sec. 918(b) requires the Secretary to submit a report to congress ""that examines how best to regulate, in a manner that best protects and promotes the public health--
&gt;(A) total abstinence from tobacco use;
&gt;(B) reductions in consumption of tobacco; and
&gt;(C) reductions in the harm associated with continued tobacco use.""
&gt; 
&gt;If you substitute the word ""smoking"" for the words ""tobacco use"" in these three items
&gt;

1367847770.0,1dshxl,Monkey University 5-6-2013: Clearos and Cartos and Tanks OH MY!,SteamMonkey,116,12,42,"Mornin Monkeys

Today I'll be discussing.... Clearos and Cartos and Tanks and all the other various types of ""toppers"" you can have. I'll dedicate a small portion of this to Rebuildables but most of it is going to be based on the various disposable and semi disposable toppers available on the market. 

Lets start with what all the toppers have in common... They're all atomizers. Hence the 'mizer' at the end of most of their names. They all have a heating element in em that connects to the battery. When the battery is engaged the coil


Initially in the vaping world you had ""Atomizers"" and ""Carts"". If you remember tea bagging and blue foam you are my brother

The original Atomizers were basically little metal tubes with a coil in the bottom and a 'bridge' of metal mesh over them that stuck up a bit inside the tube. ""carts"" were little plastic tubes that slid over these and had some sort of filler to hold the liquid in them

Eventually people realized it was better to just take off the cart

Around the same time as ""atomizers"" some one decided to combine the Cart and the Atomizer and created a ""Cartomizer"". A cartomizer is just what it sounds like

Cartos changed the world and for a while you had a very ""Mac Vs Microsoft"" thing going on. Cartos vs drippers, enhanced the coil assembly so it was more conducive to dripping, got sealed bottoms to reduce leaking, some grew in size, etc. Cartos on the other hand took multiple evolutionary 'splits' as people tried to perfect the design. 

The ""clearomizer"" or clearo was next in line. The original clearos were basically cartos with clear tubes. No other difference... they were stupid and no one liked them except that one guy reading this going ""Hey I like those!"" Sorry  man, and broke all the time. Users ""modified"" these by taking the tubes off and making their own tubes around the same time as 'carto tanks' were starting to catch on which I'll cover in a second. The ""clearomizer"" started coming out as a CE1, CE2, CE3, etc. People will tell you that a CE3 is ""this that and the other"" as far as details but they haven't been keeping up because the chinese companies making clearomizers will put whatever number on the end they think is gonna sell it so details based on ""model"" are pretty iffy at best. But... these things kept evolving. The folks making those little tanks with the ""Clearo"" guts in em inspired china and the Vivi Nova and other top coil clearos were born. Replaceable heads were pretty hot. Another path they took was the bottom coil. Where the coil is, surprise, on the bottom and instead of little dangly wicks it has little stubby wicks. Some have replaceable heads like the T3's others don't. 

In a neck and neck race for who will be king of the 'mizer' Cartos were still trying to move forward as well. We got Dual coil cartomizers which have... 2 coils. We got longer cartos and mega cartos that were ginormous but still ultimately just tubes with fluff in them. Then ""Tanks"" happened. People learned that you could put a big plastic tube around your carto

So

So, usually around a wick that sticks through a hole in the deck down into a tank full of liquid. There are a number of little 'versions' of this but at the core they're all the same. There are also 'dripper' rebuildables which have no tank, just the posts and you make a little coil around some wicking material and just drip into it. 

There will be an entire Monkey U on the history and future of RBAs so I'm not going into any more detail than that on RBAs just yet. This is geared more towards a new user looking for an education on ""toppers"".

You might notice I didn't mention the ego-T style tank or atomizer. Theres a reason... that horrible thing is a wretched peice of crap and is dead to me... DEAD.  No one should use them

Here's why:,Fr3shMak3r,114,13,56,"There are a few threads recently regarding fraudulent charges showing up on people's credit cards after making purchases from online e-cig vendors. 

This just happened to me as well. An unauthorized charge to match.com (this seems to be typical - possibly this is how the CC thieves are testing accounts)

Some are pointing to certain specific vendors - none of which I have used. This is very likely effecting multiple vendors.

It's not a virus or malware: All of my orders have been placed using my iphone or ipad. One benefit of iOS being so locked down is that it makes this

The two most likely common denominators

1. Someone has found an exploit in an eCommerce system that multiple vendors are using

2. Someone has compromised one of the merchant payment systems.

3. Someone has compromised a web hosting provider that multiple vendors are using

I've been a web developer / software engineer for 17 years. I know a little bit about how this works.

The only way to get to the bottom of this will be for vendors to work with other vendors to try to find the common denominator here. Some vendor names have come up enough that it's likely they are one of the ones who have been compromised

Don't assume your system is safe. I'm going to post below with a list of all of the vendors I have used in the past 30 days. I encourage others who have been effected to do the same

I realize not all vendors watch this subreddit. Vendors should be contacted directly as well, payment and hosting services they use to see what the culprit is, then engage support for those systems to get the problem resolved, or switch to something else.

Ok, that can be put to rest. But there *are* health impacts and side-effects to vaping, and brushing them under the carpet is only going to come back and bite us in the ass.

Here's what I already know about (in no particular order):

* Dehydration - eLiquids contain PG &amp; VG, and ultimately your body if you do not hydrate adequately
* Aforementioned dehydration can lead to kidney stones
* Ingestion of eLiquids can kill children
* Nicotine headaches (ranging in severity)
* Vaper's tongue (still not entirely clear what this one is about)

**I'm not trying to fear monger**. I freakin' love vaping now, that there is this fantasy that ecigs and vaping is 100% totally fine. Kidney stones and infant death are really damned serious.

**This community is a hell of a lot better with this than the various forums I've been on.** But even here I get the impression that no one really wants to talk about health issues because it may be damaging to our cause.

I am really interested in a frank discussion of the health issues mentioned above, even if just as a counterbalance.

1354440271.0,14592x,Some things you should keep in mind as a new/potential vaper.,SirTimmyTimbit,123,23,75,"##Ego Batteries

I see a lot of new vapers are getting Ego-C or Ego-T batteries and kits. They are very attractively priced but an Ego Twist is **significantly better** for just a few dollars more. 

* Fixed voltage Ego batteries like Ego-C or Ego-T deliver a steady 3.7v to the atomizer/cartomizer/clearomizer. A variable voltage Ego battery

* Fixed voltage batteries will affect your vaping experience **negatively**. Sometimes 0.2v is the difference between the perfect warm vape and a burnt vape. If you have an Ego Twist

* If you have a fixed voltage battery and get a **Vivi Nova** with it

* Atomizers/Cartomizers/Clearomizers lose resistance over time. What might be perfect today might taste burnt tomorrow. If you have an Ego Twist

* **Even if you don't need variable voltage get the Twist anyway** and just leave it at 3.7v. A Twist can perform like an Ego T/C but not the other way around.

* This is almost 2013. We have **Variable Wattage** PVs now with OLED displays. PVs with built in software and dynamic variable voltage/wattage are in the horizon. RBAs are now affordable and gaining market share.

   Variable voltage is the bare minimum requirement for a PV now. **VV is no longer a luxury

-------------------------

##Atomizers and You

So you are a new vaper and you keep reading Boba's this and Vivi Nova that! You want to get in on the action and get all the things everybody is raving about.

**STOP**. 

Let's clear out a few things first.

Let's say you get 7-8 juice and 2-3 Kanger T2s and a Vivi Nova. **You have more variety of juice than accessories to vape with.**

Sure you can fill out a T2 with one juice

**Get an Atomizer**. 

In short Atomizers let you drip a few drops of liquid into it and vape it straight away. After a few puffs you can drip a few more drops of the same juice *or a new juice* and keep vaping!. This way you can **sample 10 different flavors under 10 minutes**

Atomizers are a little harder to work with but once you learn the quirks **nothing else can beat the flavor**. [Watch this video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3oS7Lao8ds)

What I'd say is get a few bottles of juice

Sample all the juice first in the atomizer. If you really like a juice then fill up a T2 with it so you can take it everywhere. If you really really like it you can fill up a Vivi Nova with it so you won't have to fill up as often.

Don't forget to get drip tips for atomizers and cartomizers.

-------------------------

##Cartomizer Tanks

**You don't need one**. Before you go out and buy tanks make sure you like cartos first. A carto tank is simply a reservoir that keeps feeding the juice in the cartomizer so you don't have to fill it up manually. 

A regular sized cartomizer should last you an entire day. An XXL one lasts even longer. A carto tank is not a necessity. 

**Instead try a wide vareity of cartomizers**. They are many different ones and they work differently. Some good ones include Boge, Ikenvape LR Fusion and Kanger Vertical Coil cartos. Get a few of each, fill them up and see which one you like the best.

Get a tank only when you know you want to vape cartomizers all day. 

-------------------------

That's all for now! Keep vaping and keep trying new juice!

-------------------------

##Edit 1

* Turns out the real world regulated voltage of the Ego C/T is around 3.2-3.5v. They advertise 3.7v but that's not what they deliver. 

* A carto will probably not last you an entire day.

* A lot of you are pointing out that a fresh unregulated battery on a LR atomizer is better. Sure that may be but this was geared towards somebody who is just starting out.

   Vivi Novas and Clearomizers are often suggested to newbies and they buy them too. A VV device would let them fine **tune their vape** and help them utilize all 3 heads of a Vivi Nova.

1371733770.0,1gq3kw,I started a vape revolution in my city!,youpizzashit,129,33,32,"About 2 months ago I wanted to start vaping. I've seen some pictures on the internet of people using fancy e-cigs and I always like any technology looking stuff.

I went to all the smoke shops and headshops in my city

I ended up just getting some cheap cig-a-like and I hated how it didn't feel at all satisfying. 

I looked up vape store in *my city* and found out there was one right by my house! It was a sunday and they opened the next day at 10am. 

I head out there before my 11 o clock class and immediately I knew I was going to spend some money that day. 

He had the basic stuff

I bought a double starter kit for me and my girlfriend and redbull juice/sweet tarts. He is way overpriced now that I look back

Within two weeks I became a vaping monster. I vaped everywhere. School, restaurants. No one had really seen anything like that before in my city because it's fairly small (60,000ish). In those two weeks I bought a 650mah battery, several tanks, an ego twist, a ton of juice, and an MVP. I am about this life. 

I posted [THIS](http://imgur.com/e8AFdrK) picture on facebook/tumblr/twitter/instagram. I have quite a few followers because I used to be in a band/I am a social media marketer for my job/make instrumentals for local hip hop artists/photograph for the surrounding areas bands at shows. Within an hour people were messaging and commenting on what the fuck I'm smoking and how cool it looks where they can get one. I converted about 12 smokers in my college classes and online. 

Fast forward to today and now I frequently see people my age that post pictures on the internet of their egos and clearos in my area and people always message me asking for advice like I know everything which I am far from.

It's really nice seeing a whole bunch of people quit smoking and going out to parties and multiple people are vaping. I still like going to restaurant bars and baffling the bartender and have them try some honey pearry or peach rings on the spot and seeing their reaction. 

Another marketing success! ಠ‿ಠ

I've been reading a lot of posts and comments from new vapers, and welcome other redditors to chime in and contribute to this list.


**FastTech (is):**

* Very cheap -  a great place to shop for vaping supplies if you're strapped for cash or want to try out a new setup. They have a lot of starter kits and cheap setups for new vapers.
* Supplies a lot of imitation hardware
* A good place to find cheap mechanical mods
* An international supplier that takes 8-20 days to ship (as stated in check-out).
* One of the best places to grab cheap carto tanks, and (apparently now) VW devices with a working flashlight (TBD). Read the reviews/discussion if you're curious about a particular product!
* Carries Pyrex tanks! These tanks won't crack
* Great place to throw in some headphones

**FastTech (should NOT/is NOT):**

* Be linked to in vendor/classified posts. Sellers are well aware of market value. If you don't think the deal is that great
* In the United States. Everything ships from Hong Kong.
* The fastest supplier. [Your package crosses the largest body of water in the world](https://maps.google.com/maps?q=united+states+to+hong+kong&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;aq=t&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;channel=fflb&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=N&amp;tab=wl). It may take a while. Like any other supplier
* The best place to buy mod batteries aside from the Panasonic CGR18650CHs
* A supplier of ""quality"" juice. It may be cheap
* The best place to grab replacement coils or cartomizers. Google and sidebar searches will yield mixed results for this. Some people receive genuine equipment
* The best place to find ""high end mods"". The term ""high end mods"" in itself is speculative depending on the mod
* A B&amp;M or online supplier WITH a direct name/face/number to contact in case you have an issue. You can't call up someone from FastTech and ask their personal opinion about the product you're about to order

**Bottom line: As with any supplier


While redditor's results may vary, you know your supplies are either coming or being held up in customs.

Furthermore, please do so. (DISCLAIMER: Not necessarily your B&amp;M. Online retailers work, too!) You're helping the growth of the e-cig industry here in the US (even if your supplier gets their orders from overseas). Yeah, you can grab a pack of carto tanks for a couple bucks cheaper, but you won't get that smiley face and random complimentary drip tip from your regular supplier.

We're talking about money, and you won't have to worry about your Protank 2 being stuck on a tropical island with a volleyball and Tom Hanks.

The fact is, cohesive flavor profile...think about how much better a hearty stew tastes a day or two after it's been sitting in the fridge.  

That being said

* Upon receipt, new air enters.
* The bottle then goes into the steeping drawer (cap on)
* Every day (sometimes every other day, and given another light squeeze to allow more fresh air into the bottle. 
* This process continues with every bottle until it is ready for review
* I have also recently begun giving every bottle a single night, just before review to help dissipate any of the volatile perfume-y/floral notes that some juices (pomegranate, blackberry to name a few) are burdened with.
* If at that point, I will occasionally attempt a hot water bath (sometimes even two) to see if there is any difference in flavor...to date, this has had no effect on bottles that have already been properly steeped.

I did not get called in by management

I really didn't give him an opportunity to tell me that I can't use the vape on property.

I explained that since California, that it then falls to the policies of the place of use.

In this case

And since the policy specifically states, that I am not in the wrong and until it becomes policy, to include vapes in their prohibition, that by law, I am able to continue it's use whenever and wherever I please.

He said the he will convey my concerns and arguments to management and HR, constructed and researched and he would be getting back to me.

Any who, he said melon flavor, and then he said that he just got it 2 days ago. I told him to stay put and i will be right back. I went and grabbed my vape kit which i carry with me, first thing i did was give him my [SETUP](http://i.imgur.com/TQbrnrb.jpg) to vape some of the honey perry that i have, his eyes just bolted out of his face. Then i proceeded to lecture him on what he needs to get to make his vaping experience more enjoyable. By the end of it i had three of his friends towering over me asking me all sorts of questions, and i answered every single one of them. But i always made sure to tell them that all they need to remember is /r/electronic_cigarette, i mentioned that more than i can remember.
And before i left i cleaned his clearomizer and filled it up with some honey perry. The amount of thank yous where overwhelming. I felt good doing what i did.

But that did not end there; i ended up filling two more clearomizers for two totally different strangers. And i also handed out the vapor chef's buisness cards to them. Hey chef

I really feel great for showing others that there are far better things out there and all they have to do is look for it. I hope i made a difference in their vaping experience. Yes I’m a 3rd of honey perry less but it felt good showing others the light.

My personal stance on vaporizers is that they're not tobacco products. Nicotine does not equal tobacco anymore than caffeine equals coffee.

As such I try to distance myself from using the term ""Ecig"" or anything cigarette related. In current product development I'm even pushing my form factors away from tubular just to avoid the relation. I want this to be a 'new' product category just as it deserves to be. 

The other issue is 'vapes' tend to get quickly associated with THC vaporizers and I'm not going to get into the discussion of legality or where it is

PV's has become a pretty common term. I'm going to be moving to NV and NVS for nicotine vaporizer and nicotine vaporizer system. I feel it's more specific

I'm not tryin to shake things up or go nuts or anything but I am going to sorta campaign for the new terminology because I feel it helps our case. If you guys adopt it and use it in other communities hopefully it'll catch on. If not

**If you're buying from a reliable source

I often see new vapers asking is XYZ vendor's juice really worth the price, and great juice from something that it truly out of this world?

The answer is actually pretty complex.

### The Base

People often ask, but PG is usually 99.5-99.8% pure. It may seem small, but the .2-.5% can greatly affect the final flavor profile of a juice...particularly those that are more mellow in the flavor department. If a vendor like AiV, for example, were using lower grade PG (or VG), you would taste the impurities to a greater extent, as they tend to be less heavy handed with the flavoring.

Like the PG, but equally important is the source. VG can be extracted from a variety of sources and the source can affect the overall flavor (or lack thereof) of the final product. 

Many vendors, and that cost is passed on to us, the consumer. So while the profit margin may seem higher from these boutique/gourmet vendors, compared to what it might cost you to make a similar bottle in your kitchen, the recipes were often months (or years) in the making, with many failed experiments being disposed of.

### The Nicotine

Like the base or carrier liquids, and yes, it's extracted from tobacco plants. The lower the purity of the nic, the greater the peppery taste many 24-36mg/ml vapers are familiar with. 

That extract is then dissolved into a solution of PG/VG or a combination thereof. So not only does the quality of nicotine differ from supplier to supplier, let's say 99.8% pure, who uses a lower end carrier solution to dilute it down to 100mg/ml is doing themselves, their vendor customers, and ultimately us, a tremendous disservice.

### The Flavor

Now that a vendor has found an immaculately clean tasting base, the flavoring. 

With dozens of flavor houses to choose from, cohesive profile. Most (if not all) of the gourmet vendors have spent months, some have spent years, perfecting these flavors combinations. 

Chocolate is a great example. A vendor who makes a chocolate using a single chocolate flavoring compound is going to end up with a juice that tastes flat, plus secondary elements, many of which the vaper can't actually taste, to create a well-balanced, tasty chocolate e-liquid. Additions like coffee, marshmallow, sweeteners, etc....these are the things that make a really great juice

### The Facility

Ever wonder where that juice you're vaping was made? Maybe in a lab, there is no way to know for sure, and even then we can't know that those pictures weren't staged. 

If you're concerned, for bathtub juice. At the very least they should have lab equipment, a clean stainless steel table (or other non-porous material i.e. granite, glass) in a room dedicated to mixing, and proper safety equipment close by, of course.

### So...

Is your juice good? If it keeps you off the analogs than it's good enough. 

Do you find yourself wishing it tasted better, or just splurge on a sampler pack and see for yourself.

1366175967.0,1cil2s,Challenging the legality of e-cig bans,cmcagle,97,7,13,"Greetings

I'm a law student, write a brief in support of our side, and give oral arguments before the ""court,"" consisting of our fellow students and our professor. I chose to challenge the University of Kentucky's inclusion of e-cigs in their on-campus smoking ban. I did my oral arguments tonight and won!

Now obviously

A - The ban on e-cigs should be overturned under public forum analysis.

1) Banning the use of electronic cigarettes implicates freedom of speech.

* School policy-makers have stated that e-cigs should be banned

* This shows that the school's motivation is to target expressive conduct because of the message that conduct sends.

* If conduct is sufficiently expressive to be *regulated* as speech

2) The school's restriction on expressive conduct does not pass scrutiny under public forum analysis.

* With respect to persons with a right to be there (e.g.

* Government actors can only restrict expressive conduct when the restrictions are reasonable as to time

* The e-cig ban fails all prongs of this test: it extends to the entire campus and makes no attempt at being reasonable as to time/place/manner; it specifically targets the content of a particular type of expression (re-normalizing smoking) and therefore is not content-neutral; it is not narrowly-tailored to achieve the government's interest in protecting the public from environmental tobacco smoke (there is none with e-cigs); and because the ban extends to all campus areas, it does not leave open ample alternative channels for communication.

**I should note that

B - Banning e-cigs is arbitrary and capricious

1) Citizens are protected from rules, a legal term of art meaning unsupported by facts and evidence.

2) Because the University is not a legislature or other deliberative or representative body

3) The ban on e-cigs is not supported by the evidence.

* There is no evidence which suggests that environmental e-cig vapor is harmful; in fact

* Study by Consulting for Health, and a Greener Environment (CHANGE) found “no apparent risk to human health from e-cigarette emissions.” No chemical in any tested sample exceeded cancer or non-cancer risk limits for children or adults.

* Studies relied on by the University do not support a finding of harm from environmental vapor. In fact, the [propylene glycol] mist or ‘smoke’ is not harmful to bystanders.”

* Dr. Laugesen said

* Study cited by UK for the proposition that nicotine is present in vapor explicitly says that over 98% of nicotine is absorbed immediately on inhalation

* Propylene glycol is rated Generally Regarded As Safe by the FDA.

4) Even if the chemicals listed in UK's policy paper are present in e-cig cartridges or vapor

* The same chemicals are found in various nicotine replacement products

* The University's theater department has a number of theatrical fog machines which produce a smoke-like vapor using propylene glycol. These fog machines are typically used indoors on campus.

Hey there /r/ecr!

I'm still relatively new to the vaping scene (bought my first setup about a month ago) and I'm a ""serial hobbyist"". I feel like that should be my opener at some sort of group help meeting.

Whenever I find a new interest

So where did this idea come from? I've already tried over a dozen juices and needed someplace to keep track of what I like! I was tempted to build a spreadsheet to track it

The result of this programming sprint is: [JuiceDB.com](http://juicedb.com).

It's a site designed to provide you with a place to keep track of what juices you like, and there's probably a few bugs.

Currently on the site you can...

- **Login/Signup for an account**:  No email required
- **Manage your favorite Juices and Vendors**: The ""My Favorites"" page keeps track of every Vendor and Flavor you've added to it
- **Add your favorite Juice Vendors**: Select a vendor from the [vendor list](http://juicedb.com/vendors) or create a new vendor to have it added to the list (after approval). 
- **Add your favorite Juices**: Select a juice from the [juice list](http://juicedb.com/juices) or create a new juice to have it added to the list (after approval). 
- **Rate/Review 1-10 all Juices/Vendors**: Right now all it does is keeps this in your ""Favorites"" area
- **All Vendors/Juices are moderated**: Every time a new Juice or Vendor is created

The interface workflow isn't perfect yet... sometimes you're going to submit something and wonder ""why the hell did it send me to this page?"". As soon as people start putting juices and vendors in

I'd love to know what /r/ecr thinks about a tool like this. If the community wants/needs something like this, it was about 8 hours of my life to create some good portfolio materials ;)

Feel free to PM me

PS - If you're one of the /r/d3up users... don't worry... v2 is coming still

401, m402, and m403. One of many styles of electronic cigarettes available. These are all essentially the same unit (same threading on batteries and atomizers) but with different length batteries. The 401 model is the longest in physical length and battery life of the three while the 403 is the shortest in length and battery life.

510 – Arguably the most common and popular style of electronic cigarettes available.

808 or KR808 - One of many styles of electronic cigarettes available.

901 – One of many styles of electronic cigarettes available.

A

Adapter – Used to allow a specific style of atomizer or cartomizer to fit onto a different style of battery. Many users prefer the vapor production of one style of atty but prefer the battery life of another style battery. This allows them to have access to both simultaneously.

Analog or Analogue – Slang term for a traditional cigarette.

Atomizer (Abbreviated as Atty) - The part of an e-cigarette that actually heats the juice to the point of vaporization.

Atty – Abbreviation for Atomizer.

Automatic – A style of electronic cigarette battery that does not have a button to activate the heating element. Rather

B

Batt – Abbreviation for Battery.

Battery (Abbreviated as Batt) – The battery piece of an electronic cigarette is the part that provides power to the heating element. This allows the heating element to heat the Juice and produce vapor.

Bridge – A small U-shaped covering inside of the atomizer. This is used to absorb liquid and help wick it towards the heating element.

C

Cartridge (Abbreviated as Cart) – A plastic tube-like piece that is usually stuffed with some sort of absorbent filler material that holds the juice.

Cart – Abbreviation for Cartridge.

Carto – Abbreviation for Cartomizer.

F

FDA - Abbreviation for the (United States) Food and Drug Administration.

Filler Material (Abbreviated as Filler) - Material placed inside of a Cartridge that is absorbent.

Most cartridges come with PolyFill being used as the Filler Material

Flooding – Something that can occur when too much Juice is applied to the atomizer. Since atomizers require some air to properly vaporize Liquid

Food and Drug Administration (Abbreviated as FDA) – An administrative branch of the United States government that oversees rules and regulations pertaining to the safety of food and drug products sold in the USA. There is currently a very controversial lawsuit involving the FDA and the importation and distribution of electronic cigarettes.

G

H

Hot Cigarette – A slang term for a traditional cigarette.

Liquid – Also referred to as E-Liquid, or Juice. This is the liquid that is vaporized when using an electronic cigarette.

Low Resistance (Abbreviated as LR) – An atomizer or cartomizer with a lower Ohm rating than the standard equipment. This generally causes the heating element to get hotter faster and produces vapor more quickly. In many cases it produces more vapor than an atty or carto that has a standard resistance rating.

LR - Abbreviation for Low Resistance.

M

m401, 402, and 403. One of many styles of electronic cigarettes available. These are all essentially the same unit (same threading on batteries and atomizers) but with different length batteries.

N

O

Ohm - A measure of electrical resistance. A lower number indicates lower resistance and therefore faster heating.

P

If I had the experience or knowledge to do it

Currently we are being proactive on our research and bitching... not so much with the government cog. 

We need block legislation that hurts our industry

We also, we need to get bills INTO state government to be voted on that regulate our industry in a way that is responsible and benign to what we are trying to accomplish. 

Again

I urge you

My 7th point is vaping in public... This point is the one that's going to piss some people off. I love that I can vape a lot of places you can't smoke... but that's not going to fly for long. It IS going to be restricted and as such it should be proposed in a way that is not completely restrictive but still shows some courtesy to 'non vapers'. It's not a health factor as it is an enclosed air space. Personally I think if you can't vape on a train you shoudln't be allowed to get on a train if you haven't bathed recently either.... but, please understand my stance before you flame... feel free to flame, but at least take my stance into consideration before hand ;) 

1. Ecigarettes (Personal vaporizers) should be categorized as a recreational use product. 

2. E liquids should be clearly labeled and marked with appropriate warnings regarding toxicity and and addictive nature of nicotine.

3. All vaping establishments should be 18+ only as far as admittance (some of you will make a frowny face but this will make legislators smile a bit more).

4. Juice mixing rules (See Aemsa

5. Sales of Vaping products should be treated as sales of any other consumer product in regards to taxation. 

6. Online sales of E-liquid will require standard age verification used for other age restricted online content such as applied to adult oriented businesses. 

7. Vaping will not be considered smoking, including withing 10ft of buss stops or in subway terminals, establishments that prepare and serve food, indoors in retail establishments who's product offerings are less than 70% tobacco or vape related merchandise. vaping may be allowed at the discretion of the owner/operator of other establishments. designating ""vaping areas"" is an acceptable practice in places where smoking is not allowed due to the extremely limited radius of effect that vaping presents and the lack of ""second hand"" health hazards. 

8. E-liquid manufacturers will not make available for consumer purchase any pre-mixed e-liquid for the purposes of direct consumption that exceeds 36mg/ml. 

9. Wholesale of high concentration Nicotine containing liquid must be clearly labeled as ""Dilute before use"" and have all appropriate toxicity and addictive nature labels as previously mentioned.

10. Tobacco related legislation will not apply to E-cigarette use



Take that, whatever... just propose some legislation. Lets get OUR bills out there and instead of having to constantly fight 'against' something, lets have something to show our support.

Prior to this snap

The biggest problem for me is that I seem to not be getting a strong enough ""throat hit"" to curb my smoking-cravings.  Here's what I'm using:

[The EPower Vaping Kit from CCV](http://www.crystalclearvaping.com/COMPLETE-E-POWER-NOVA-KIT-and-30ml-juice-Free-priority-shipping_p_58.html) &lt;--- this is not the exact kit...they've stopped selling mine for some reason - but it's VERY similar.

Juice-wise, I ordered a ""Wensten"" flavored juice from a seller that I can't recall.  It was supposed to taste like Winston cigs  (my old brand) - it doesn't but it does seem stronger tasting.  Anyway, I'm using the strongest (35mgs) for most of the juices.  So, I don't think it's a lack of nicotine.

Bottom line, despite using clean cartridges, trying drip tips, etc., it seems that the kit is just not as strong as it used to be.  I'm noticing that I'm having to change batteries more often.

Could it be that the kit that I have is just not very good?  Is there another that someone might recommend?  I'm still pretty new to this

For those reading this post you may have seen my many previous posts on this sub asking various questions from before I got my first E-Cig 3 weeks ago


First let me introduce myself, which turned into me being a casual smoker, you know the typical morning, after any meal, after and during work smoker. 

I got engaged to my fiancé 2 summers ago and we had a beautiful baby girl on December 12, nothing worked. We would fight everyday over my smoking, which turned out relationship sour and we eventually stopped kissing, hugging, and anything other than talking and hanging out basically. 

I wanted to quit, for my relationship and for my family.

I was a lurker on this sub for about a month

Two weeks ago I had my last Camel Crush

Today, and overall very proud of myself as well as my entire family as a whole of me.

So, thank you for all your patients with all my (very obviously) annoying questions, thank you for saving my (future) marriage, thank you for helping me be able to watch my little girl grow up and most of all thank you for (possibly) saving my life in more ways than one.

I’ve heard whispers that people have been concerned about me “smoking in the office” or what looks like smoke
 
What I am using is called an “electronic cigarette” or “personal vaporizer”. The only thing that comes out of it is like water vapor – something like out of a tea kettle.
 
I have been smoking 1 pack of cigarettes per day since I was 16 years old and I have tried everything to quit, now. This is something that is going to benefit my health – and benefit XXXXXXXXX Corp. from reducing the loss of productivity due to smoke breaks :)
 
These devices work by heating up a mixture of propylene glycol, in that they heat up the mixture until it vaporizes. There is no combustion of organic matter involved and therefore no carcinogens released.
 
Electronic cigarettes are legal to use indoors in Canada, non-ventilated room. The fact our office is street-level in Toronto has a bigger impact on air quality, since we have all sorts of automotive exhaust left and right. The impact of a personal vaporizer is something akin to putting a drop of food coloring into the ocean.
 
The components of the vapor are propylene glycol and vegetable glycerin. PG has slight anti-bacterial properties and some hospitals inject it into their HVAC systems. Vegetable glycerin is a thicker
 
If you are a smoker
 
I apologize that I didn’t tell everyone when I started using this in the office. Not many people know about this nascent technology and I understand why it may ruffle some feathers.
 
If you have any questions
 
Thanks for your concern

1365378239.0,1bvsel,Help stop Rhode Island restrict online sales of e-cigarettes.,smallchanger,92,12,31,"*Got this email from the National Vapers Club today. Below is the full copy*

*****

Rhode Island and New England vapers

If you are getting this is it because you live close enough to help
us stop the Rhode Island legislation that would make it very hard for
people in Rhode Island to purchase e-cigarettes online.

 SB 622 is scheduled for a hearing before the Senate Judiciary
Committee on Tuesday

Room 313  
State House  
Providence  
Rhode Island

If you are in or around Rhode Island and can attend or speak at the
hearing

You do not need to speak
showing up will make a difference.

(Below is from the CASAA website)

This bill would:  

Ban e-cigarette sales to minors
online sales of nicotine-containing products by treating e-cigarettes
the same as traditional tobacco products.

 Specifically
sale to: (1) Obtain a copy of the buyer's driver's license; (2) Obtain
a statement from the buyer affirming that they are the person
pictured; and (3) Send the package through a service that checks the
ID of the buyer at delivery. Retailers would be required to perform
this check every time a consumer places an order.

SB 622 would also require e-cigarette retailers in Rhode Island to
obtain a tobacco license and only buy their e-cigarettes from licensed
wholesalers or distributors.

If you cannot attend, write or fax
the members of the Senate Judiciary Committee below

 What to say:

1. You support supports prohibiting the sale of e-cigarettes and
other nicotine-containing products to minors
622 in its current form.
2. Express your concern about Section 11-9-13.11 of the bill
would restrict the online sales of vapor products.
3. Explain that the restrictions would place Rhode Island
e-cigarette vendors at a competitive disadvantage by:  
    * Instituting a system that will impose significant costs for
compliance.  
    * Imposing restrictions on consumers (i.e.
confirmed delivery and age/identity proof with every subsequent sale
to the same purchaser) that will cause consumers to purchase their
products from out-of-state vendors.
4. Note that the legislation would also overly burden consumers by
requiring all shipments to repeat customers to be sent via a method
that requires an in-person signature upon delivery. This adds cost and
is inconvenient for those who are not home to receive the delivery.
5. Tell the legislators that restrictions on online sales were
instituted for two reasons: (1) Cigarette companies blatantly marketed
to kids; and (2) Online sales were being used to evade taxes. Because
there is no evidence that a single child has been sold an e-cigarette
online and e-cigarettes are not taxed in Rhode Island
reason to implement such an onerous provision.
6. Explain that online sales bans only serve to protect the market
share of cigarette companies.

It was a couple of years ago when most (if not all) of the flavoring companies were using it. You see, caused by direct inhalation of large amounts of diacetyl over a long period of time. Since you are asking about it

Obviously, we used flavorings that contained diacetyl (just like everyone else), but most of the flavoring companies (all of the ones we use) removed diacetyl in favor of acetoin. Acetoin was an acceptable replacement for diacetyl in regard to flavor, and does not cause Popcorn Lung. I know some non-American flavoring companies took longer to convert, and I'm not even sure all of them did. We only use American made flavorings, so I'm sorry but I do not have much knowledge about the foreign ones. If there are actually any vendors that still have diacetyl in their juices, there would be a couple of things to remember: First, or haven't even heard of it, don't use them. The fact that you are asking is good

So, our flavorings do not contain diacetyl. You can even vape our straight Butter flavor to your hearts content without the worry of diacetyl! Thanks for doing your homework though. The next thing you land on might be regarding oil based flavorings. That is a more recent topic, maybe about a year old or so now. I never heard any resolution on this one though. It is theorized that the oils can be difficult for the lungs to metabolize, causing a build up of it inside the lungs. I have absolutely no idea if this is true or not. However, it became a bit of a hot topic for awhile, so we took a look at our flavorings. We found maybe a half a dozen flavors that used oil based flavorings instead of water based, and we decided to immediately remove those flavors from our menu just in case. Unfortunate because the Lemonade flavor we had was the bomb! We do still have some eucalyptus flavors which contain eucalyptus oil. It is a very tiny amount (super strong flavoring), eucalyptus oil is a bit different from some of the other oils used in flavorings

So how's that for a long answer? We have been at this for awhile now, when these things come up we evaluate our products to eliminate anything that could potentially cause harm. I would say I hope this answers your question, but I'm pretty sure you found the answer buried up there somewhere!

While *taste is subjective*

To better illustrate my point, Indigo's Capt. Ron. Those of us that have had it can all agree that it's a Banana Tobacco blend with a hint of coconut on the exhale and finish. Those of us with a more discerning palate can tell you it's closer to a candied banana flavor than a natural one. 

No one is going to tell you that Capt Ron tastes like pixie stix or green apple jolly ranchers

While it's true that certain aspects of a flavor profile may be more pronounced to some vapers than to others, the coconut may be slightly more pronounced than to someone who adores coconut and wishes there were more of it, but in reality,the ingredients of a juice will always be the ingredients of a juice. 

Another great example is the Boba's that everyone seems to lust after (you should check out eJoose Dead or Alive

If you were to spend the better part of 8 months reading thru the ECF thread about all the different things that different vapers taste in Boba's

In reality, the stronger the tobacco. Same goes for age...the more Boba's steeps, the more the tobacco presents, as the sweeter flavors move towards the back of the flavor profile. 

That being said

2. Production for the item can be scaled to meet demand if demand increases.

3. The price point is justifiable. A premium is expected when dealing with products built with quality materials by well trained individuals but a 300 dollar mod stand that holds 4 devices is not justifiable. A mechanical mod with a bottom switch and a 510 connector at 400 dollars is not justifiable

Injection molded plastic parts: I have a number of projects that will revolve around 'cheaper' alternatives to mech mods I""m launching in the near future. plastic boxes are the answer to that. This would be custom mold work. 

Machinists: I have a shop for my current major projects but I'm looking for another machinst with CNC capability and reasonable pricing for a couple of other projects. Mostly small parts. 

Glass workers: I have 3 projects involving glass

Electrical Engineer: I have 3 chipsets I need created. I expect to have to outsource this a bit when it comes to production but if you can design an affordable chipset to do the things I need done I will work with you so that you become my supplier. You design the chipsets, the other two I'll help with the design and then you can market them to as many vendors as you want.

First I'd like to note some changes to format. I'm moving this to mondays and I'm moving this to the /r/ecr/ sub based on a LOT of requests that I do so. (formerly I'd been having this in /r/steammonkey/ and just Xposting it the day after). 

Every Monday I'll be posting a different 'University' thread with a goal of creating a 'space' for people to ask questions about a specific topic and those with answers to put em down. 

Post guidelines: If you have a question ask... there are no stupid questions, external links to references are AWESOME. 


Now, not dip too far into the advanced vaping things like RBAs etc, but that doesn't mean people can't ask those questions. My personal write up is just going to be geared more towards that 'first time' vaper who knows nothing about what's going on aside from ""electronic cigarettes are supposed to be cool"". 


So

Vaping is essentially an alternative form of nicotine consumption that closely mimics the most common form of nicotine consumption (smoking) with a great reduction in the number of chemicals and particulate matter going into your lungs. You get your nic by heating a small coil of wire to a point that it will vaporize a nicotine containing liquid that you then inhale and exhale like smoke. The overall experience is VERY similar to smoking. 

To vape you need a few basic things. 

1. Liquid to be vaporized.

2. A coil to do the vaporizing.

3. A method of delivering the liquid to that coil. 

4. A power source for the coil. 

That's it... so why are there so many different permutations of those basic ingredients? It's a lot like mexican food... same 4 ingredients arranged in different configurations for our nomming pleasure ;) I'm going to go forward breaking down those 4 categories (I'll be combining 2 and 3 since they tend to come in a 'package' deal). 



**Liquid to be vaporized.** 

The liquid will be called a lot of things. E-liquid, liquid, lung yummies, etc. Usually it'll have some sort of fluid inspired name and it's the only ""liquid"" component in this set up so if you hear some one referring to a fluid of some sort they're probably talking about the nic juice, I'll be referring to it as juice moving forward. 

Juice is comprised of all or some of the following ingredients: nicotine in a liquid base

Generally speaking the differences between PG and VG. PG is thinner and provides greater ""throat hit"" or that harshness some people seek out in their vaping experience. I personally feel that PG delivers cleaner flavors and you taste your flavors 'more' with a higher PG concentration. VG is thicker and produces more visible vapor on a draw. A common ""blend"" tends to be somewhere around 70/30 (always PG/VG) though you'll find the gambit if you ask. 

There is a rare but not unhead of PG sensitivity. You could find out that PG does not agree with you. it's pretty uncommon and generally not overtly dangerous unless you ignore the symptoms and chain vape through it. Symptoms include but are not limited to (note, ulceration of the soft tissue in your mouth, sore gums. If you find yourself with a PG sensitivity don't fret... there are a number of manufacturers who make 100% VG liquids. 

Nicotine usually is listed in a ""MG"" strength. This stands for milligram per milliliter. It also relates to ""percentage"" if you've got 18mg juice you've got 18 milligrams of nicotine per milliliter of liquid and 1.8% concentration of nicotine per total volume. What strength nicotine to you need if you were a pack a day smoker?... that can't be answered. Some people will come in here and say ""Oh, it's all over the board. I tend to recommend people get a variety of juices and start with 18mg if they were heavy smokers. The bonus to 18mg is if you like the flavor but don't like the strength you can cut it with a weaker concentration of the same flavor to bring it down to where you want.

Facts about juice:

1. PG is toxic to cats

2. Nicotine is a poison. Period. it's a poison we like to use because it makes us feel funny, ever. Do not drink the juice, do not put the juice in your eyeball, do not use it as a moisturizer, do not feed it to infants, don't shoot it up, basically don't do anything but vape it and vape it responsibly. If you start to feel nausea or a headache after vaping, cut your nic to a lower level or consult a physician. Don't ignore your body

3. If people say you're vaping ""antifreeze"" smile and say yes then tell them to google propalyne glycol. It IS antifreeze. So is alcohol technically. It's a safe to consume antifreeze used in a lot of places where toxic AFs can't be used. You're also vaping pesticide... nicotine is used as an organic pesticide in a lot of green house operations :P


**A coil to do the vaporizing and a method of delivering liquid to that coil.**

So the coil... this is where the magic happens and where people will find constant discontent. I can't possibly cover every detail of every type of 'topper' in this discussion so I'm going to cop out and give you some generics :) People in following comments can go into greater detail on their personal favorite juice delivery system. 

I'll break these up a bit. 

The fluffies: Some top devices have fluff in em. If you reach back into early vaping or a mall kiosk you might be confronted with the ""cart"" and atomizer set up. This tends to be an atomizer which is a small tube with a ""bridge"" of porous metal and a coil in it. You'll know the 'bridge' because it tends to look like a little triangle of metal sponge sticking up from inside the atomizer. It is usually topped with a 'cart' which is a plastic tube with an airhole on one end. A lot of times they'll be foil sealed and the way they're supposed to work is you stick em on the atomizer, moving on. The next ""fluffy"" is a cartomizer.... Cartomizers are basically a metal tube with a roll of fluff inside and inside that roll of fluff is a coil. you saturate the fluff with liquid and vape away. These work great but aren't without their restrictions and short falls (as all systems are). You can augment your cartomizer with a 'tank' which is basically a tube you stick over your other tube and fill with juice. you punch a hole in your cartomizer and liquid can continually soak the fluff from the larger tank. This makes cartos last longer and (imo) taste better. 

The wickies: Clearomizers.... there are about a billion versions of clearos. Initially they were cartomizers with clear tubes a coil at the top and a little wick that stuck down into the tube that had liquid in it. No fluff. These leaked, it's a clear tube with a coil at either the top or bottom, wicks coming from that coil into the juice reservoir. 

The drippies: This is just an atomizer. They come in a few formats but it's that atomizer I mentioned above with the fluffies... but without the fluffy. There are also ""rebuildable"" drippers but I'll cover that in a sec. This is basically a coil and some 'tiny' amount of wicking material of some sort. It could be a hard ceramic bowl or a little piece of silica/stainless steel mesh. It's always as simple as possible. you drip liquid on it

The Rebuildables..ies?: This is a semi recent boom in the vaping industry but people realized they didn't like throwing away a bunch of stuff everytime a coil got yucky so they figured out how to make things you could just rebuild the coil in. These come in a number of form factors but you'll hear ""Genesis"" and ""Dripper"" a lot. a genesis style RBA has a deck where you build your coil

&gt;
&gt;I am emailing to ask for an official and in-depth response regarding the recent regulatory decision and a statement explaining some of the wording regarding electronic cigarettes on your website. As a regulatory body whose entire purpose is to ensure that people are protected and have products available to them that suit their needs, citing all pertinent sources where applicable.
&gt;
&gt;Firstly - your decision reflects your desire to conform to EU tobacco legislation
&gt;
&gt;My question is simple
&gt;
&gt;Regarding the press release on the website
&gt;
&gt;""Making safe and effective products available for people who smoke can help them cut down or quit.""
&gt;
&gt;“Some NCPs are already licenced and the Government's decision to work towards medicines licencing for all these products is designed to deliver quality products that will support smokers to cut down and to quit.""
&gt;
&gt;""Recent public health guidance published by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) supports the use of licenced nicotine products in helping people to cut down or stop smoking.""
&gt;
&gt;""The RCGP supports MHRA regulation of novel nicotine products such as e-cigarettes as this will ensure that they are of good quality and reliability and are effective in helping smokers who want to use them to cut down and quit.”
&gt;
&gt;I'm sure by now you see where this is going. Your regulatory decisions seem ENTIRELY based on electronic cigarettes as part of the NRT range of products, patiently and empirically false. The invention of the electronic cigarette was by a Chinese inventor who wished to continue smoking but remove the majority of the harmful elements from it. Electronic cigarettes are not a nicotine replacement therapy aimed at weaning people away from the use of nicotine. Classifying them as such greatly reduces their effectiveness. No sensible vendor of electronic cigarette products has ever claimed a medicinal benefit from these products, simply put because they are NOT medicines. Electronic cigarettes have a great chance of helping people to ditch traditional tobacco cigarettes and that is a wonderful side-effect of their use but they are not purely a quitting aid. Electronic cigarettes, as confirmed by many of the studies and clean air reports linked below, are a safer alternative to cigarettes. Alternative being the key word here. They are an alternative method of delivering nicotine to people already addicted, people who enjoy the act of smoking and yet are fully aware of the dangers cigarettes contain and were until recently unable to distance themselves from the dangers while retaining the satisfaction of the habit or the calming effect of the nicotine. It is my understanding that classing electronic cigarettes and associated personal vaporiser devices as medicinal products would mean that under current regulations a manufacturer would be required to prove, via clinical trial, being an alternative to smoking tobacco
&gt;
&gt;Please concisely explain your decision to regulate electronic cigarettes as medicinal products when the overwhelming majority of vendors have not claimed therapeutic or medicinal benefits and furthermore please explain your viewpoint which seems to be that electronic cigarettes are purely designed as a quitting aid and not as an alternative recreational nicotine containing product?
&gt;
&gt;Thus far, suddenly I don't really feel like continuing trying to appeal to you with facts, or even sound logical discourse, it all becomes pretty clear what the MHRA intends to achieve with this decision.
&gt;
&gt;I am utterly disappointed in each and every one of you. While you ""regulate"" and turn control of an entire industry over to only the companies rich enough to become ""licensed"" by yourselves
&gt;
&gt;My personal vaporiser is not a medicine. It is not something for you to regulate. Try taking a pack of cigarettes off someone and see how much resistance you encounter, no matter how much you regulate on behalf of your vested interests. I will not smoke because you want to crush all the successful small businesses that are taking money away from your sponsors. We will import, we will make our own juice at home, anything to not be controlled by gigantic money machines, where chasing the almighty dollar is more important than protecting the lives of the people who depend on you.
&gt;
&gt;You have no evidence to support your decision
&gt;
&gt;Maybe it would have an impact if you knew the person who actually submitted the draft of the EU legislation you have vowed to back [resigned after an anti-fraud inquiry linked him to bribes from tobacco companies while writing the draft.](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-19964248) I doubt it
&gt;
&gt;Though it seems your aim was never to protect people

They are absolutely smitten with the ability to smoke and enjoy themselves without harming themselves or their grandchildren! 

My dad, but he's really enjoyed the basic Halo tobacco flavor I sent him with his first setup. Since father's day is right around the corner, I decided to send him a [tobacco sampler from Indigo Vapors](http://www.indigovapor.com/product_p/s-tobaccopack.htm). I kept reading here on this subreddit about how great Indigo Vapors tobacco flavors are, so I thought that an all-tobacco sampler for my dad would be a perfect gift. I ordered late last Tuesday, expecting a delivery for sometime the week of father's day. I also sent Indigo a short message letting them know that this was a father's day gift, and that I would really appreciate it if they could send a couple of samples for my mom, who also loves her brand-new ""puffer""!

Not only did the package arrive by Saturday (to extreme rural Oregon, but they also included a sweet handwritten ""happy father's day"" note for my dad and several delicious samples of their fruit and gourmet flavors for my mother to try!

I live an entire continent away from my awesome parents, exciting, beautiful, and delicious package for my mom and dad to dig into. 

Tonight my mom gave me a call, Indigo Vapors has a new client for life in me and now my parents - not to mention my aunt, uncle, step-nieces, and neighbors of my parents, all of whom have been drawn in by my mom and dad's enthusiasm!

Okay, they will eventually have some better things in.

Next visit, the OWNER told me it was 24 mg and asked what level i wanted. I told him 12. He went in the back and brought me a bottle labeled with the flavor, but not the nic content or pg/vg ratios. He didnt seem to know what pg/vg it was.  That was funny because the first visit a clerk told me the owner mixed the juice himself.  Whatever, paid, left, and for the next week tried the flavor off and on, but it soon became clear the nic level was higher than he had claimed. I couldnt vape much of it, lightheaded

So today i went on my lunch break. A new clerk was there who seemed to be enthusiastic and had done research about vaping. We talked for well over an hour and compared our sets and the merits of what we had tried.

None of this clerks vaping gear had come from this B&amp;M. Why? Because all this B&amp;M has, sets and juice could have fit in a single shoe box. And the starter sets they had, these; http://www.fasttech.com/products/0/10005168/1405704-ego-ce5-2-in-1-usb-rechargeable-650mah-electronic-    were priced at 45$.

So they are ripping people off badly. Customers were coming in, i even got to see an mvp. And they were all leaving without buying anything. 

No wick

The clerk said this had been happening since they opened. Some very new vapers come in for their first set

And the kicker. All the juices are preordered and shipped in. They only have ONE nic level. 24mg. Anything else needs to be special ordered.

I was lied to about nicotine levels. I was sold a bottle twice the level i asked for. 

I am pissed off and fed up with an owner who is willing to lie and refuse to carry any stock that customers have been asking for.

If i had the money i would open up a vape store and run it just to put this one out of business. 

What really sucks is that this town needs a good vape shop. A lot of people smoke here

I and a lot of the other vapers i have spoken to in this shitty store ( right in front of the owner) would gladly pay a good markup for the convenience of not waiting on shipping. But the way this is going

I am just disgusted with this place. If you want to move and open a vape shop with no competition

Edit. I am not naming the shop. I dont want the employee who talked to me to get fired even if the chances are really low that anyone will mention this to the owner. I will say it is in southeast missouri. And i am serious if anyone wants to open a shop here

Anyone that has come to this sub even once will recognize what a ripoff this place is. And local internet forums already have the info on how bad this place is. ( i searched them after this rant

Folks

Anyone who makes a suggestion will get a gold star next to their name though you also need to have accumulated at least 500 link karma or comment karma to be awarded the star. You have to make a suggestion in every new recommendation thread to keep the star even if it means just copying and pasting your suggestion from the last recommendation thread if you think it is still a good suggestion. 

Please remember, how much liquid to get etc etc. Jargon and abbreviations will probably confuse them unless explained. They need a list of everything they will need to get started. Just saying something like 'get a twist' isn't going to cut it. Recommendations for products from countries outside of North America are most welcome too. Have a look at [our last recommendation thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/electronic_cigarette/comments/r1z4d/reddits_ecig_recommendations_thread_2/) to see the kind of suggestions that are useful.

Fair warning time. These are tips based off of my experiences. Your mileage may vary. These devices and juices are listed as smoking alternatives

Tip #1. When transitioning over, I put it out, and have not had a cigarette since. It'll take a bit for that to sink into your brain. 

Tip #2 When transitioning over, not having your smokes with you will cause a huge amount of anxiety. You will constantly be thinking about them. However, if you have them with you, the anxiety will not be present. You will know they are there, and can have one if you need one. When you feel the urge, do your best to vape instead. 

Tip #3 If you smoke a pack a day or more, and I HATE the thing. I found myself upgrading to an ego battery and clearomizers WAY quick. Save yourself the time and trouble, go for the bigger battery. Avoid the blu-style things if you smoke a pack a day. Trust me on this.

&gt; Economies
In the final analysis, faulty charger, battery failure, and an APV with no safety features. This chain does happen occasionally, and we now need to take positive action to prevent the situation continuing.

&gt;  If the device has several safety features
  
&gt; If you buy the best batteries you can, then it is unlikely they will fail.

&gt;  If you buy $3 batteries then accept the fact they are less safe than $10 batteries.

&gt;  If you buy the cheapest battery charger you can

1368565610.0,1ec8c3,"Monkey University 5-14-2013: RBA, RTA, RDA, WTF?",SteamMonkey,10, class is in session. Today I'll be discussing Rebuildable Atomizers. This is gonna be a big one

First

RBA: Rebuildable Atomizer

RDA: Rebuildable Dripping atomizer

RTA: Rebuildable Tank Atomizer

SSM: stainless steel mesh

Silica: Glass fiber rope wick material. 

awg: American wire gauge. You'll see this follow a number designation. With wire the lower the number the lower the resistance per inch but the thicker the wire actually is. 


So, atomizers, clearos, etc, they all have an assembly that you end up throwing away, RBAs save you from having to chuck stuff that is otherwise still serviceable, reduces waste, allows for more customization of your vaping experience in the form of building your own wick/coil arrangement

Common to all RBAs is the Deck and some type of 'top cap'. The deck is the part that has the connections for the coil

So the RBA is the piece of hardware that comes in the box, I'm back. 

So let's start with wire cause it's the easy part to talk about. 

As mentioned in the definitions

Now this isn't normal wire... this is resistance wire. It's a special alloy that does not conduct electricity well. This means when you shove a bunch of electrons into it they bounce around more than just flowing through and some of the energy they have is released in the form of heat. This is why the coil heats up but the wires in your walls don't burn your shit down when you plug in a toaster. You cannot make a coil out of non resistance wire like copper, hooking one end to the + pole and the other end to the - pole. You then shape the coil into whatever shape you want, most people make... a coil. Usually around the wicking material of your choice. There is no perfect coil set up, it's going to be personal preference. I like a giant 28awg coil sometimes and other times I Like a tiny little 36awg coil, on some devices I""ll use 32awg and wrap it up to 3ohm other times I'm running sub-ohm coils. 

The resistance you shoot for will be heavily dependent on the device you'll be using to fire it. If you've got an ego

I'm now going to talk about something you shouldn't do unless you know what you're doing... multi-coil set ups. I'm only putting this info out there to be educational and thorough... don't screw with multiple coils unless you're equipped properly with both the right tools and the right information (all of which is not going to be included in this post). 

Some folks like dual coils (or more...) basically what you're doing is putting two resistors in parallel which effectively halves the total resistance on the line as far as your battery source is concerned. I.e. 2x 2ohm coils in parallel will appear as 1ohm of resistance between the + and - terminals on the battery. Keep that math in mind when building a dual or multi-coil set up. Total resistance in the circuit = sum resistance of all coils / number of coils. Beyond that

While on the topic of resistance... look up Ohms Law, etc. You'll need that. Theres a Monkey University specifically on Ohms law, hit the [Monkey Blog](http://blog.steammonkey.com) to find it.


Oh


Now... how do you get juice to your coil?

WICK!

In a RDA you'll generally just wrap the coil around a little chunk of wicking material of your choice

In a RTA things get a little more complicated. With an RTA you've generally got a hole through the deck down into a tank that you fill with juice. The most common material of choice for wicking here is SSM or stainless steel mesh. There's a lot of voodoo around SSM and getting it set up right, and wicking capability. But that conductivity thing is an issue... that's why people torch it or burn juice on it, or wrap it with a RYO cigarette paper and burn it, or pray to some dark god to take away the magical electron carrying properties of the mesh so that vapor may be thrust unto their waiting mouth. it's complicated... I hate sayin this again, but go to youtube. There are a million different ways to do it and I've tried em all... none of them are any better than the others once you learn to do 'that' method right. As an example, in my Aga-T, I torch before rolling, soak in juice then burn the juice off before wrapping my coil. In the RSST I use what's called the 'pulse' method

So

Airflow... 

With all RBAs theres some method of getting airflow over the coil


Now

A lot of us RBA fans do just that :p However, stainless mesh and build your own coil in a device that welcomes that sorta thing. 

RBA's are not a 'natural progression' as some people seem to think. If you're happy vaping a carto on an ego you don't need to go out and buy a mech mod, RBA, mesh, wire, multimeter, heavy duty scissors, etc. Just vape the carto! However, even if it's only a marginal increase

There is 1 RBA that I think anyone who likes to change up juice should have and that's an RDA. I'm not a dripper but I do like to try new juices occasionally. I used to use a standard off the shelf dripping atomizer. Switching to a RDA changed how I test juices. The ability to just rip out the guts if you get some skunky juice and wipe the thing down is a HUGE benefit

Genesis style (RTAs) RBAs are great once you get em rolling and can provide a superior vape but if you pop a coil or get a hotspot while out and about

At the end of the day RBAs are great

Now

When I got into e cigs he helped me with many questions I had. Well it turns out he is only an hour away from me in Canada.

All though I have never met him he has gone above and beyond what a normal person would do.

When I was waiting for my Rebuildable supplies to come in from the USA which takes forever he sent me a package with a ton of kanthal wire

Today I got vape mail from him and this is what he sent me

Welcome to [r/electronic_cigarette](http://www.reddit.com/r/electronic_cigarette/). You probably have lots of questions about what to get and where and as you can imagine we get these questions alll the time especially when we are linked to from a major subreddit. 

As of today

The third button links to the search results for the most recent new vaper questions. It lets us see all the new questions at a glance and also lets some users who might not want to see these types of posts

So before you ask a question
*****

* If you want to learn a bit about vaping
(The last one in the list under the heading 'starter guides' is the newest)

* If you go there you will find links to many other sticky'd posts too including links to threads about favorite e-liquid

* Also in the sidebar you will find links to posts like [**Reddit's Recommended E-cig Suppliers**](http://www.reddit.com/r/electronic_cigarette/wiki/supplier_list) and [**Reddit's e-cig recommendations**](http://www.reddit.com/r/electronic_cigarette/comments/1j4cco/). That second recommendation thread was specifically created to recommend e-cig kits to new vapers because we get that question constantly. A new recommendation thread will be started every two months because new e-cig products are always being developed and so sometimes recommendations lose their relevance. 

*****

That's all I can think to say at the moment. This post will be replaced at some point in the future with a link to simpler and more segmented guide in the new wiki system where we can also answer the most common quesions. I hope to also start lists of different types of products and where to get them to make starting vaping less confusing for the beginner. There is a list to some of the bigger [**e-cig mods here**](http://www.reddit.com/r/electronic_cigarette/help/faqs/electronic_cigarette#E-cigMods) if you are curious about some of the bigger e-cigs on the market though it also very old and needs to be updated.

Thanks for reading!

The first thing I thought I'd do is get some of our resident artists involved. 

I'm looking for vapor propaganda posters! These should be of sufficient resolution to be made into a poster or at the very least a flyer. 

I don't care about content, ""vintage"" style from any of the big ""ages of propaganda""

Any message is ok as long as it's Pro vaping in some way. 

Compare it to smoking and go for the shock factor, I don't care. If pro-lifers can show aborted fetus on their posters, we can show rotten lungs or dead people. 

Take the ""funny"" route

Go the eye catching beauty route and make it a piece of art with a message.... 

I don't care. 

The only rules are DO something and make it Pro vaping. 

I will run this contest for 2 weeks. I'll repost a consolidated version of this thread with the current submissions every few days depending on size and where it falls on the current list of topics so people can see it. 

I will be picking 3 winners. 

The first place winner will receive a box of Overstock. I've got a huge amount of random gear that I held back incase I needed to do replacements for people from my sales. I've got various RBAs, you name it, a bunch of stuff. I'll throw an entire box of goodies at the first place winner. 

The second place winner will get a Silverback Kit and a 15ml bottle of the juice of their choice from my current offerings. 

The thid place winner will get a Chimp kit and a 15ml bottle of juice of their choice from my current offerings. 

I will be judging based on the viability of the image for use on the internet or as printed media. 

The effectiveness of the message... does it ""work"".

Quality of the image, or it could be artistic merit if it's an artsy piece. Just know, an awesome infographic could beat an amazing hand drawn image and vice versa. 

The Top Ten images will be turned into posters and hung in my Brick and Mortar store once I open (hopefully early next year) 


By submitting this work

Hit me with your best stuff artists/graphics folks! 

Folks following along at home, upvote it. 

If you see one you just HAVE to share, reddit elsewhere, twitter, whatever. I'll be sharing the top ten once the contest is over, pretty much everywhere :) Let the Vaporwars begin.

(brownie points for making it vintage lookin ;) I Love me some old school war propaganda posters!)

Please make sure your billing address is correct.  If you moved recently make sure all your addresses are updated with the proper banks and credit companies.  Our system now kicks you back to the checkout page if the zip and street address do not match what is on file.

If you have ordered from us before and your card is being denied now

EDIT: I got some stuff figured out.  Now the system will deny an incorrect zip code and warn me of incorrect street address but still accept the sale.  I know a lot of people use prepaid cards that don't have a street address associated with the account.

...there was a line of people cued up for the doors to open. I met monocule_otto who gave me his half-full bottle of MBV Hawk Sauce. Thx dude!  I brought juice to trade but he was weaning down a nic level and I was holding several bottles of 24mg. So I turned to these other guys and tried to pay it forward... but then the doors opened and everyone rushed in. So much for my 1st PIF.   
  
So I stuff my joose and rush in too
  
The second thing I see and hear is this awesome band called [THE ATOMIZERS!!](http://i.imgur.com/acLMtl2.jpg) Yea

And I meet all of [these guys!](http://i.imgur.com/CeB9BmY.jpg)    
  
And [that guy!](http://i.imgur.com/0dDdoRO.jpg) 
  
And then I run into the [motherlode.](http://i.imgur.com/1wAWqZt.jpg) 

An MBV motherlode!  Rows and rows of [MBV joooooose!](http://i.imgur.com/wQWngkN.jpg)   

I think we pretty much all went bananas! And then

And vaped. And vaped. And tried all the MBV flavors. 

Nothing like vaping with other vapors.  Like kids in a candy store. JJ hooked it up. Thx JJ!  Free 20ml of juice, a variety of spicy chicken nuggets and everyone having a good time = fuck yea!  

And THE ATOMIZERS were really getting into [their groove!](http://i.imgur.com/mfwUbEx.jpg)  

Covering songs in theme with TVSs ejuice. Everyone waiting for the MBV guys to show up. And finally they did! And it was [HUGS](http://i.imgur.com/DkBLUne.jpg) [ALL](http://i.imgur.com/QUUMV95.jpg) [AROUND!](http://i.imgur.com/F02PtIf.jpg)   

Then Jesse and James hopped behind the counter and did what mixologists do best

It was mighty fun to see these guys mucking it up with everyone. Good guys

JJ and his spot on crew also introduced their Funk, the Ike &amp; Turner, the Jimi Hendrix and the Purple Haze. I almost settle on a very peachy Ray Charles but then I tried the Al Green and I knew it would be my new fave ADV. 

I start talking to another The Vape Spot Bartender about RBAs and he said “you need to talk to Rick

So I walk over with eyes glazed over in anticipation and guess what? Rick is straight dropping knowledge helping some guy with his rebuild right there in front of me. I’ve only seen that shit on vid!!! I wish I would have snapped some photos

Oooooohhwwaaahhhh that first hit. Are you kidding me? I couldn’t even see my own eyeglasses right in front of my goddam eyeballs!  It was like a warm

All in all, visited from afar by another great group of people.  Who knew that quitting analogs could be so fun?!

What more can I say? Oh I know…

I went to The Vapor Spot/Mt. Baker Vapor VAPEMEET and all I got (lie#1) was this lousy T-Shirt! [\(lie#2\)](http://i.imgur.com/MrtdMGg.jpg)

1359600739.0,17lsi9,go on take the money and run... woo wo woooo,SteamMonkey,76,9,44,"So.. 

Steam Monkey is going a lil dark for the next couple of weeks. I'm not closing down or anything but I got nailed in the last couple of weeks and I'm pretty much out of stock on all the 'big ticket' items like Aga-T+, etc. I'm almost out of twists which will relegate me to basically selling cartos, mesh, wire and drip tips... not a lot of folks place orders 'just' for those types of little things. 

I was sad at first but I'm also closing on a new house with a proper workshop, and all the normal crap that goes along with my so called life ;) 

I'll still be processing orders, chinese new years is obviously playing the major role in that. The timing works out though cause I dunno if I'd have been able to juggle the order volume + restock inventory + process all my materials on top of everything going on right now so I'll count my blessings even if it means a lil loss of income during the process. 

I sorta hate losing momentum but... I'm working on some pretty fancy stuff with some pretty fancy people that I hope to get moving in the next couple of months. Stuff I think you ladies and gentlemen (and Slumberland) will really like. This also gives me some free cycles to spend on that. 

I'm posting this because I don't want you fine folks to think I was a flash in the pan sorta shop

Thanks for being a great community

IN the hiatus... I'm open to suggestions for potentially new items to stock when I get back in action... I'm currently eyeballing that ""Groove"" thing madvapes just got in, etc, for bulk juice manufacture).

Thanks again

Quick explanation would be voltage is what controls the level of heat coming to your coil compared to your resistance to create wattage

A simpler explanation would be think of VV as a manual car and VW as an auto car. With VV you need to check the resistance and apply enough voltage depending on the atomizer to create power. Variable wattage basically just adjusts that for you depending on the given circumstances (much like an automatic car adjusting your gears for you depending on the circumstances).

Much like cars, variable voltage will teach you the fundamental science behind the voltage and wattage (like gears in cars!).

About 2 months ago a smoking friend showed me his eGo vape and I thought it novel but kind of silly - until he'd mentioned that since he'd switched to it the only time he'd have

I've been vaping that gear for a month now and transitioned to 0mg juices and been nicotine free for the past 4 days. I picked up a bunch of tanks so I can give each juice it's own tank but other than that I've shied away from geeking out on the mods and options. But it's been the most natural, a half dozen or more friends and workmates who have asked about my gear and juices, and had the disquieting/confusing/awesome experience of a non-smoker asking me to blow vapor in their face because it smelled so good. 

I'm pretty active physically and even when I was smoking I never felt like it was *directly* affecting my sports performance. That is, I feel like I'm getting *rest*. 

But the **biggest** difference has been about the smell, it's become foreign and off-putting instead of familiar. I don't notice the smell **more**, I notice it **differently**. Before, it would identify someone to me as a comrade...someone who wouldn't judge me or treat me with contempt before even getting to know me, and I would offer the same consideration in return. And the more that cigarette smoking has not only become socially unacceptable but **aggressively** unacceptable, the more I see how much a wall that smell builds around people who smoke. How much a wall it built around me. I'm a reasonably attractive person, have a good career, and aside from smoking, you can say well fuck em

Smoking SUCKS, but what **really** sucks is the shame and self-loathing and social exclusion that has taken place in the collective conscious regarding smoking. I can understand why, on the surface, a non-smoker would not want to date or be around a smoker given a preference, but what really caught me sideways has been how *cruel* the non-smoking world is now that I'm closer to that side of it. It's almost like as a vaper you've snuck into the cool kids clique at high school and you're hearing all the terrible things they say and think about everyone they believe is ""lesser"" because as a group they can validate each other on how horrifying smoking is and how horrifying the people are who smoke, and it's not like as a smoker you didn't hear those things but being on the non-smoking side of it now it all sounds so much uglier and inhumane...

I don't **ever** want to be the ex-smoker that's succumbed to the douchebag koolaid. 

**TL;DR Quitting cigarettes and vaping for a month has made me realize that never-smokers can be self-righteous douchebags and the biggest difference I've noticed in quitting smoking hasn't been in how I feel

There will be many more of these pretty frequently as long as people keep offering their goods for the cause. A website is being worked on by a fellow redditor to hopefully streamline this so we have a place that I can see who is donating what and who is receiving the kits. Right now I'm keeping track through PMs and its getting hard to organize. Next giveaway will be someone else offering up goods and either they will post or I will post on behalf of them. If we get to a point where a complete kit can't be made then I or another redditor help fill the gaps.

Ill be closing the giveaway on Wednesday evening. Once the person is chosen ill ship the kit the next day (if I don't end up with strep and the flu this time).

Good luck to all!!

So today I went to Vape Dojo, and was planning on making the switch sooner, but. Hospitals and being sick overall prevented that. The staff were very nice, and knowledgeable. I had tried the crappy e cigs before, that you get at the mall. Yeah, i wasted the hundred dollars, and even washed my cig in my clothes. I even have one, that one of my coworkers gave me after she quit. It was a low tobacco though, here's what I ended up with. http://imgur.com/zxF5HIn

Luckily, that recommended and wrote the prescription for Chantix, never warned me about anything else that could have happened adversely. I'm glad I'm off it now, as a couple of days after I went off it, i started to get into a dark place. Luckily, i kept a grip and told myself that it's just the medicine.
