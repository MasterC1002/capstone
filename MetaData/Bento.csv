*  Make an attractive bento meal in the most boring or ugliest container (Because some people like cute or stylish containers to go with their meals)

*  Make the most boring bento meal ever (because attractive is too easy)

*  Cultural-themed bentos (e.x: All Italian/Chinese/American/Ethiopian/etc)

*  Lowest calorie bentos w/ breakdown of calories (if that's even possible)

*  Make a bento meal in [x amount of hours or 30 minutes]

*  Bentos centered around a main ingredient

Hi everyone!

UPDATE: Hi! I just wanted to say thanks to everyone for your nice comments and suggestions. A common view was that the prices of shipping could be lower. We have now added a third shipping option which takes a little longer but at a much cheaper price!

I've opened an online shop selling the best Bento Boxes and Japanese products I can find in Japan. When I lived in the States/Europe

The usual high cost of p&amp;p is offset by sending small packages (and splitting large orders) rather than sending one large parcel so we are much cheaper than other similar stores.

The site is only a day old
