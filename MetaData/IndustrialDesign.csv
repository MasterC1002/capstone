1365270502.0,1bt08n,Minimalist Tape Dispenser.,Methylene_Chloride,90,9,39,"This sub-reddit is a bit quiet


This is a 2nd year University project to design


After initial brainstorming and rough sketching of ideas, simple to use product. I came to the conclusion that a single piece of polypropylene bent around the role of tape with a serrated edge would work, so I went ahead and made a batch of prototypes testing lots of different things. 


http://i.imgur.com/9a8f8qv.jpg


It failed, or make it work. Back to brainstorming and looking at other dispensers. Looking at how they worked, why they worked and what made them worked I figured out why mine didn't. I done this before redesigning, to not waste time and effort on a flawed idea. 


A solid material was needed, It stopped being consumer and cheap and it became more aesthetic, even a bit designer. I still focused on function, like all of my design work but kept an eye on the aesthetic, playing with shape and personality.

Finally, the where cut from the same sheet, using the same machine at the same time with the same (roughly) serrations. But only one worked. 


My theory was that it was the angle of the serration, taller, thinner, less of an angle etc. 


None worked. This project became an obsession, endless testing and testing. Two rolls of tape later I realised why. So a new set of prototypes where on their way for the next day...


http://i.imgur.com/o0FAhgZ.jpg


they all worked


Option 1: Make a consumer tape dispenser (original plan)
Option 2: Make it smaller into a key ring
Option 3: Focus on aesthetic


I chose option 3 after much deliberation, making it cheap and selling it cheap wasn't a viable option. I needed to add value to the product.

Now I had two options for my aesthetic. The face, which I named ""The Last Leaf"". I ended up taking it to vote with everyone I knew and met, and just carried an example of each in my blazer pocket. 


The outcome was the leaf

And then onto my final product



Here is the final product

I feel like our field is highly unknown

I've been told I make factories, that I'm an artist, or that they were completely oblivious. I'm in my senior year and my family still asks what my degree is called.

I feel like the fall back thing to do is say ""Product Design"" but that even confuses people so I move on to saying ""everything you buy in a store was designed by someone like me...""



Also I noticed that there are many titles that describe our field while searching job listings:

* Industrial Design

* Product Design

* Consumer Design

* Commercial Design


Edit: I get the feeling from your responses that it becomes easier when you have a focused area/industry to work within. Saying ""I design phones"" or ""Automotive Design"" is really less confusing

I think the hardest thing to describe would be if you worked for a consultancy and have no area of expertise since you work on a broad spectrum of things every day. I guess I would lead with the companies you design for most.",,t5_2qiv5,1373218675.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/IndustrialDesign/comments/1fn2up/industrial_designer_oh_so_like_you_design/

First Topic- During my freshman year, white eraser, sketch pad, and etc. But then he listed 'markers', which obviously doesn't explain anything about brands/colors/shades/quantity. When we asked him, he said ""Buy which ever color you like and also two others- one that is lighter and darker."" But as the year went on, i realized that i needed to buy more markers than what he suggested. At the end of the year

So

**TL;DR- Topic 1** A color-customizing marker that customizes specific colors (maybe through color picking an image,) by using CMYK. [Similar to this.](http://www.gearfuse.com/color-picker-lets-you-grab-the-colors-of-nature/)

Second Topic- From what your just read, something that may look like [a carrying case of a hand drill](http://www.p-wholesale.com/upimg/17/700a2/impact-drill-kit-kf-6005-183.jpg). But instead of having tools it would have..

I randomly ran across you today... Maybe you can offer some advice?

I'm in the process of patenting a little device that a friend and I are working on. We're super excited about it and have high expectations for it but we've hit a speed bump and we're having a hard time getting over it.

Problem is I've spent a decent amount of money with an industrial designer here in town and have gotten nowhere with him. He's super nice and had what I thought was a genius plan but that didn't work out so now I feel like he's scrambling for ideas and not getting anywhere. 

I've approached a couple of other industrial designers separately and they all assure me they can give me a solution but want $$$ first to make it happen. Well that didn't really work out the first time so I'm not too eager to pay someone else to experiment. I've also now waited four months while this guy drags his feet and am still right where I started.

So what expectations am I allowed to have from the industrial designer? If he cannot produce should I request some of my money back or is that out of line? I'd like to move on but I don't want to waste my time or anyone else's time anymore.

I don't mind paying for the solution either! I'm confident that I'm not looking for anything that is impossible to make.

Maybe I can set up a contest? 

Or approach a school or organization?

I'm open to ideas. I have found that there are not many industrial designers in town. Google searches turn up a bunch of people with furniture in their portfolios but that's it. Lots of people know about metal and wood but I need softer material expertise like silicone and/or fabrics.

Oh and basically what I'm looking for is an enclosure for bracelet. There are electronics involved. 

Thanks for reading.

I absolutely love sketching. Give me a day to myself to do whatever the hell I want: First thing I'll do is grab a pencil and a sketchbook. I love drawing cars, Medical Device Design) and got a lot of experience sketching mechanical functions of products, mechanisms, blow-apart drawings, cross-sections, plane and perspective product views, etc. I find this stuff a LOT of fun. I wouldn't say my sketches will blow your mind

I'm currently working on a portfolio website where I showcase all the stuff I've done so far. Aside from ID, print design, and photography. I'm putting all of this into my portfolio.

To cut to the chase, foam models, scale models, functional hardware prototypes, proof-of-concept models, or anything like that at all. Most experience I've got with this is a couple gargoyle mugs I made out of clay which I glazed and painted later.

I just got a new assignment for school and I'm pretty stuck and without ideas. 

My assignment involves using a cardboard box to create something that could be useful in a docters without borders field hospital. We're supposed to use the same box that is now used for shipping medicine and emergency supplies. 

The first things I had in mind was to transform the box into some sort of cabinet which then could be used to store the medicine in an organized way. But that is the only thing i can really think of. And it's pretty obvious.

Pretty much anything useful in a field hospital/disaster context would be allowed to be designed with that box.

Does anyone have good ideas or things that could inspire me?

Thanks
