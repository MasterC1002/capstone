**What do you think is the most underrated philosophical argument

&gt;There are many, a mistaken direction partially rectified in the 17th century.  In his framework, a house is a combination of matter (bricks, timber, etc.) and form (design, intended use, etc.).  It follows that the way the word is used to refer cannot be specified in mind-independent terms.  Aristotle’s account of form only scratches the surface.  Further inquiry shows that it is far more intricate, raising further questions.  Extending these observations (which to my knowledge apply to almost every simple word), undermining a lot of standard philosophy of language and mind, for example the central role he assigned to what has been called “the creative aspect of language use

**In your mind

&gt;In its modern usage, say, apes (who have approximately the same auditory system), songbirds, etc.  In short, it would take a discovery that would be a biological miracle.
There is massive confusion about this.   Consider, and plenty of counter-evidence) that what we are now doing is just the interplay of cognitive capacities available generally, perhaps also to other primates.  If true, then UG would be the complex of genetic factors that bring these alleged capacities together to yield what we are doing – how, would remain a total mystery.
There are plenty of other confusions about UG.  For example, it is “fiendishly difficult” (to quote one) to identify the genetic basis for even vastly simpler “traits” than the language capacity.

**Professor Chomsky, as too complex to be handled by a simple context-free grammar. What are your thoughts on grammar formalisms in the class of mildly-context sensitive languages, such as Combinatory Categorial Grammars and Ed Stabler's Minimalist Grammars? -surrenderyourego**

&gt;Some crucial distinctions are necessary.

&gt;My work on these topics in the 1950s (Logical Structure of Linguistic Theory – LSLT; Syntactic Structures – SS) maintained that human language is outside the scope of CF grammars and indeed outside the scope of unrestricted phrase structure grammars – Post systems, hence also the extremely marginal matter of crossing dependencies.
The question here does not distinguish sharply enough between formal languages and grammars (that is, a derivative and dubious notion that has no clear relevance to human language,  for reasons that have been discussed since the ‘50s.
Any theory of language has to at least recognize that it consists of an infinite array of expressions and their modes of interpretation.  Such a system must be generated by some finite generative process GP (or some counterpart, GP will weakly generate the set of terminal strings derived by additional operations that strip away the hierarchical structure.  It could well be that the correct GP for English weakly generates every arrangement of elements of English.  We may then go on to select some set of these and call them “grammatical,” and call that the language generated.  
As discussed in LSLT and brought up in SS, a great deal can be learned about language by study of various types of “deviance” – e.g., the striking distinction between subjacency and ECP violations.  Hence in two respects, it’s unclear that weak generative capacity tells us much about language: it is derivative from strong generation, a linguistically significant notion; and it is based on an arbitrary and dubious distinction.
Study of weak generation is an interesting topic for formal language theory, and the significant issues of inadequacy of even the richest phrase structure grammars (and variants) lies elsewhere: in normal scientific considerations of explanatory adequacy, of the kind discussed in the earliest work.  Further discussion would go beyond limits appropriate here, but I think these comments hold also for subcases and variants such as those mentioned, though the inquiries often bring up interesting issues.


**For the greater part of five decades, you've got to retire at some point, and the field will at some point be without your guiding hand. With that in mind, where do you envision the field going after your retirement? Which researcher(s) do you see as taking your place in the intellectual wheelhouse of linguistics? Do you think there will ever be another revolution, where some linguist does to your own work what you once did to Bloomfield's? -morphemeaddict** 


&gt;That’s quite an exaggeration, increasingly so over the years.  There’s great work being done by many fine linguists.  I could list names, but it would be unfair, because I’d necessarily be omitting many who should be included.  Much of my own work has to be revised or abandoned – in fact I’ve been doing that for over 50 years. This is, after all, empirical science, not religion, I have my own ideas

""Buffalo buffalo Buffalo buffalo buffalo buffalo Buffalo buffalo""
(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffalo_buffalo_Buffalo_buffalo_buffalo_buffalo_Buffalo_buffalo)

and ""James
(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_while_John_had_had_had_had_had_had_had_had_had_had_had_a_better_effect_on_the_teacher). 

Then my housemate and I thought: what if we combined the two sentences? Could an even more confusing sentence be made? The answer appears to be an emphatic 'yes'. 

Here is our first attempt:

'Buffalo buffalo that buffalo Buffalo buffalo that buffalo Buffalo buffalo, while John had had 'had', had had 'had had'; 'had had' had had a better effect on the teacher”; “James, while John had had 'had', had had 'had had'; 'had had' had had a better effect on the teacher” had had a better effect on the Buffalo buffalo Buffalo buffalo buffalo that buffalo Buffalo buffalo than “Buffalo buffalo Buffalo buffalo buffalo buffalo Buffalo buffalo” had had on the Buffalo buffalo.'

A sentence to buffalo anyone... Kudos to anyone who can work out what it means!

I always talk about how phonetics and phonology are my thing, if I can. I've taught introductory linguistics classes before, so I have no doubt I could put something together for phonetics/phonology. I would offer to do other things, but I don't really enjoy them and I think you would learn best from someone who is passionate about those specific subjects.

So here's the deal. I can start with how I taught the beginnings of phonology in an Intro to Linguistics course. After that's done

Currently the only thing I'm upset at myself about is that I threw out all my phonology worksheets from undergraduate a long time ago, that would be great. I wouldn't feel good saying, ""Here's yet another constructed dataset for a fictional language!"" for every lesson, or having to read through a phonology paper on a random language to look for transcriptions and their meanings in various languages.

What do you guys think? I can't guarantee the ""lessons"" would come very quickly, so I would have to look up examples for British/Australian/Canadian English unless there are other Redditors who speak those dialects and would be willing to give a short summary in the comments on how their ""national"" dialect differs.

What does Yoda's syntax look like in non-English versions of Star Wars?  For those who aren't familiar with Star Wars (all two of you), uses what seems to be an OSV syntax instead of the traditional SVO syntax.  

So how do foreign translations of the script handle this?  I am particularly interested in what it looks like in non-SVO languages.  Are there any translations where Yoda's incorrect syntax is emulated by using an English-like syntax?  Or are other languages' syntax so free that mistakes in the use of case or verb conjugations must instead be used to emulate Yoda's ""alien"" speech?

Does anyone have any information about how Yoda speaks in non-English versions of Star Wars?

**EDIT:**  We've gotten some great and informative responses from many of you, Finnish, Persian) is particularly appreciated.

**The Master List so far...**

* Czech:  Free word order.  Yoda speaks consistently in SOV.  Interestingly enough

* Estonian:  Free word order language.  Yoda retains the English OSV order.  This is grammatical in Estonian

* French: An SVO language.  Yoda speaks in OSV.

* German:  A SVO or SOV language.  Yoda brings the Object to the front (OSV)

* Hungarian:  A free word order language.  There is nothing unusual about Yoda's speech.

* Italian:  An SVO language.  Yoda speaks in OSV.  Note: OSV is also the syntax used in the Italian of the less-proficient speakers of Italian from the region of Sardinia.  

* Japanese: An SOV language.  Yoda seems to use a more or less correct syntax

* Korean:  An SOV language.  Nothing is unusual about Yoda's grammar.

* Norwegian:  An SVO language.  Yoda speaks in OSV.

* Romanian:  An SVO language.  Yoda speaks in OSV.  He also places adjectives before the noun instead of after the noun

* Spanish:  An SVO language.  Yoda speaks in OSV.

* Turkish:  An SOV language.  Yoda speaks in OSV.  Note:  This order is also used in classical Ottoman poetry,False,self,t5_2qhos,True,,,t3_gfoov

- The French and Spanish words for ""right"" (""droit"" and ""derecho"" respectively) both originate from Latin ""directus""

- Finally

And as expected

So in conclusion, but I hope someone here will. Perhaps all these connotations originated in a single language (Greek? Latin?) and were later borrowed into others? Even if that's the case, what could the original reason be? Examples (including counter-examples) in other languages, especially non-IE, will also be appreciated.

A website that allows you to enter the vocabulary words you know in a language

With each article, and perhaps even includes an updated mnemosyne/supermemo/anki flash card stack.

I would pay for this! On a monthly basis

**Addendum for idea #2:**

So everyone seems to dig the second idea. Perhaps the most sensible way to use this product/website is from *day one* of starting to learn a new language, in your native language, on a subject you're really interested in, and it pull out the top *translated* words you'd need to understand a similar article in the language you're going to pick it up in. This could help to start that initial entry of vocab words that would be awkward to get the ball rolling.

So

**Phonetics**

Phonetics is, individual sounds themselves. Linguists will sometimes refer to individual sounds as *phones*. When someone says ""a 't' sound,"" that's a phone. Words in spoken languages are made up of collections of phones.

When dealing with phonetics, the way you make your [t] may be different from someone else. When we use the [International Phonetic Alphabet](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Phonetic_Alphabet) (which I'll go over later) to transcribe sounds, we're more saying that they're *similar enough* rather than they're exactly the same.

The idea we just touched on relates to *articulatory phonetics*. That is, if it's not meaningful, your brain has adapted to ignore it. However, just because something ""sounds the same"" doesn't mean that it is. Articulatory phonetics also covers wider things than just minute differences- it also covers, for example, the articulatory difference between a [t] ""t sound"" and a [k] ""k sound."" Using phonetics terms, you can describe how these sounds are the same and how they are different. This is an integral part of phonology as well.

Personally, voicing (vibrations of the vocal folds - the difference between [t] and [d]), and for vowel quality (basically where the vowel is made in the mouth and what vowel it actually is, acoustically).

So we've looked at how sounds are made and the characteristics of those sounds. Then there's *auditory phonetics*, but they sound exactly the same to you. This is strongly related to phonology, and as you probably know, it's impossible to completely separate phonetics and phonology. They do, however, work on different ""planes"" of linguistics. Let's talk about phonology and it should become a bit more apparent.

**Phonology**

If phonetics is all about cold, which are our best description of a real, acoustic sound that has been recorded. Phonology, on the other hand, introduces the idea of a *phoneme*. A [phoneme](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoneme) is defined as the smallest unit of sound capable of forming meaningful contrast.

What does that mean? It means that two words with different meanings can differ only in a single sound. For example

So, phonemes influence one another and can change each other into other sounds.

Phonologists look at cold

So we said that phones are cold, that's voiced"" (usually...). Phonemes are theoretical constructs used to discuss the sound systems of languages that utilize contrasting sounds. Phones and phonemes come together when we discuss *allophones*. Allophones are a phonetic variant of a phoneme, conditioned by its environment (surrounding sounds).

The best example I can provide for this comes from American English. As some of you may know, or the *surface representation*, you know that it's not really a ""t"" sound. People describe it as a ""soft d,"" but we're linguists dammit. We're going to call it what it is- a flap or tap [ɾ]. [] brackets are used for phonetic transcriptions rather than underlying forms. Don't worry about the IPA symbol for now. Just realize that it's not a [t], and that the /t/ is expressed outwardly as a [ɾ]. That's an allophone, and an important word for our next few lessons. (I should also add that the [t] in ""tip"" is also an allophone of /t/. An allophone need not be a completely different sound.)

**Homework-ish Stuff**

Consider the definitions of the following words:

*Phonetics*

*Phonology*

*Phone*

*Phoneme*

*Allophone*

Which discipline (phonetics or phonology) do the following best fit into?

Certain consonants are more aspirated in English than in Spanish.

In Japanese

In the Creek language

**Method**

1. *Sample collection.* I used a script to crawl the top fifty links in a selection of subreddits twice per day for one week. Each time the script found a new link, the script selected a maximum of one sample at random from the results of each search. A total of 3,898 samples were collected.

2. *Sentence categorization.* I created a web application (now offline) that allowed users to categorize sentences and then solicited help from /r/grammar. Each sentence was marked by two users. If the two graders agreed (99.1% of cases), has/does not have apostrophe, (3,4) contraction, has/does not have apostrophe and (5) bad sample. If the graders disagreed, the sentence was flagged for review.

First

* Exactly one hundred people contributed to the project

* Graders had a disagreement rate of just 0.9%.

* Fans of the [Pareto Principle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle) will enjoy the fact that the top twenty graders marked 80.01% of the sentences.

The [Turkish vowel chart](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7e/Turkish_vowel_chart.svg/500px-Turkish_vowel_chart.svg.png) looks a little funny, it makes sense - all the possible combinations of those three variables are represented.

But I've been looking into Manchu (specifically Literary

[Manchu Vowels](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2c/Manchu_Vowel_Chart.svg/500px-Manchu_Vowel_Chart.svg.png).

four different vowel heights on 6 vowels?

only one front vowel, all differentiated only by height?

[wat.](http://i.imgur.com/COhrwsa.jpg)

First thought - ""this can't be right."" But I found [this source](http://www.manjurist.net/Thesis_Final.pdf), Mandarin-speaking and Korean-speaking sources contemporary to when Classical Manchu was spoken and yep, this is about right.

Second thought - ""well, actual articulation be damned!"" But *nooo!* Guess which vowels form a natural class (due to vowel harmony)?

* ""Yang"" class - /ʊ/
* ""Yin"" class - /ə/
* Neutral - /i/

So

[wat.](http://i.imgur.com/2nLidBQ.jpg)

Manchu vowels *also* harmonize over rounding, /u/ are round, rest are not, as would be expected).

Then I stumbled across [this paper](http://homes.chass.utoronto.ca/~dresher/papers/BLSManchu.pdf), /i/ is pretty clearly [+ATR], yet it doesn't act like it! It acts like it doesn't have [ATR] specified at all!

The only way the Dresher and Zhang manage to get it all to work is to come up with an incredibly convoluted hierarchy of the articulatory features [Low], and [ATR].

Okay

So

However I also wanted to provide any interested parties the opportunity to ask me questions about either the research or the process of acquiring my MA (I also have a previous BA in Applied Linguistics).

I'm now carrying on to a degree in Speech-Language Pathology (SLP). This change in direction is partially motivated by the medical bent of my research interests

Finally: I won't be offended if nobody reads the thesis - it's quite a bear. If anyone does, but I hope that it has added some value to the (small) community of researchers in language and mental health.

This consonant is already readily available in Arabic's phonemic inventory

**EDIT**  

Not to answer my own question, /i/, and /u/.   In most cases, they are realized as such, but certain so-called ""emphatic"" consonants have a centralizing effect on nearby vowels.  Depending on the speaker, these vowels would be realized as something along the lines of [a], [ɛ]

So what's the point?  Well, the best Arabic approximation for the o-like vowel in democracy would be [u].  However, using a [q] would centralize this vowel to something closer to [o].  It would seem as though Arabic had a choice between preserving the European consonant, [k]; and preserving the European vowel, [o].

In the past few years a new wave of nationalism has hit Romania

As you might know, it was populated by [Dacians](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dacians)).

Not content with the idea that our language is the result of colonization, Latin is derived from Romanian, not the other way around.

How is this possible

- Modern Romanian is actually the same language as ancient Dacian. With some changes

- Ancient Datin is actually derived from Dacian in the following way: 1) Greece was created by people who originated from around the Black Sea area (Thracians). 2) Rome was created by people who originated from Greece. So ""naturally"" it follows that Dacians =&gt; Thracians =&gt; Greek =&gt; Romans. So when the Romans conquered Dacia

Some arguments they come up with to support this theory are:

- The fact that the monument dedicated to Emperor Trajan's conquest of Dacia

- The fact that later-period Roman statues seem to feature Dacians in preeminent roles

- A quote attributed to Trajan during his campaign of conquering Dacia

Just this year, who has said the following, during a TV interview:

&gt; ""I think what is not often remembered is that Romanian, not vice-versa, in other words Romanian is not a Latin language, rather Latin is a Romanian language, so I want to salute those people from Bucegi mountains and around Brașov, Bucharest. You are the ones that gave the great vehicle of western culture (the Latin language) to the world.""

&gt; Source: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luWa_vLgc2o#t=55s

Of course

With serious funding from nationalist circles, called *""Dacians, Unsettling Truths""* which you can find here, if you are interested in following this story:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PBdNU7xAcM

My question is: are any of these things actually ""problems"" with a natural language? It seems like this question is often just assumed and not actually addressed. I feel that much of art

This isn't strictly grammatical.  Since the subject of that clause is *I*

But shades of meaning are lost in that case.  I think it comes down to the ""essence"" versus ""state"" copula and the fact that this distinction is not made in the English verb ""to be.""  The structure of the phrase ""I am awesome"" suggests the ""essence"" version of the copula--I am always awesome, it's meant to be a transition from one state to another: I cease to be sad, and begin being awesome instead.

I could see a more grammatical version that maintains that distinction as:

1. English silver / Basque zilar ""silver""

3. English Troy (city) / Hittite (w)ilusa ""Troy""

4. English mead / Etruscan maθ ""honey

5. English bake (v.) / Greek Βάκχυλος ""bread baked in hot ashes""

6. English thumb / Sanskrit túmra- (adj.) ""big

Optional question: Get it right

---

***ANSWERS***

1. Related. English silver &lt; Proto-Germanic *silubra, Iberian, Basque, and Celtiberrian (which competed with the native Celtic word 'arkanto'). A classic Wanderwort. 

2. Not related. Troy &lt; Greek Truisa &lt; *Truisas. Wilusa &lt; *Wilus. Earliest Hittite records refer to Wilusa being a city in the land of Truisa

3. We are 99% sure they are related. While a small minority of linguists believes Etruscan maθ to be coincidentally similar (such as Proto-Dravidian's unrelated *mattu- ""honey"")

4. Not related. English bake &lt; Proto-Indo-European *begh- ""to warm."" Greek Βάκχυλος is from a Pre-Greek language that was not Indo-European (note the non-Indo-European geminate -κχ- and suffix -υλ-) but the name of this ancient language is unknown.

5. Related. English thumb &lt; Proto-Germanic *þūman- “thumb” &lt; Proto-Indo-European *tu-H-m- “to swell

Bonus. Related. English aegis &lt; Proto-Indo-European *ayg- ""goat."" A rare root noun with a reconstructed pair *ag- ""goat."" The rarity of *a word initials and the *ayg- / *ag- pairing betrays a likely loan source believed to be Proto-Northwest Caucasian. Abkhaz á-žma &lt; Proto-Northwest-Caucasian *ač:wa. One of the extremely few words believed to enter PIE from a Caucasian family and not the other way around.

I can come up with one guess as to why this is: as rulers of an Islamic state, I would still expect the Arabic dialects of the world to have accumulated a great sum of Turkish loanwords and expressions over the course of their centuries-long rule by the Turks.

Granted, a form based on the pre-Ottoman dialect used in the Koran.  However, to my knowledge, no Turkish loanwords seem to exist in the modern Arabic dialects spoken in the Middle East.

And a response post: http://www.reddit.com/r/Anthropology/comments/vamex/my_response_to_the_vanishing_languages_post/

The most upvoted comments seem to range from indifference to outright glee about this fact.  Many seem to think this is because the languages are unable to adapt/evolve (in a broadly darwinian sense) and are thus eliminated accordingly.

Facepalm-worthy comments are along the lines of:  ""oh well Latin/Sanskrit died out too."" (nevermind the 50 or so languages each one developed into)

The best defenses I saw in favor of language revitalization had serious sapir-whorfian overtones.  

Counter-arguments generally posited that the academic/cultural/psychological value of linguistic &amp; cultural diversity was vastly outweighed by the detriments it posed to the economy/politics/ etc.

*****************************

The best arguments I could think of:

*  Sheer amount of data that would be lost.
*  Cultural legacies shouldn't be decided by the entitled majorities
*  Strong correlation (yes I know the difference) of linguistic diversity to biodiversity
*  Each language loss is a permanently missing chunk of information that can be used to aid genetic studies

Some background:

English is my second language

I'm sure that I never learned to subvocalize as I read because I remember thinking to myself how strange it was that people mouthed words while the read silently and that it was weird that others couldn't read and talk at the same time. I also remember a conversation with a friend of mine in late elementary in which she mentioned a name that I didn't recognize. It turned out that it was the name of a character from a book that we had both read

A while back I thought the reason I might not subvocalize was because I had learned to read Chinese characters where

For example, I always thought this meant ""I have my doubts/reservations"" and that it was more a sarcastic utterance. I can see how it could be seen as sarcastic, but here in Poland no one really uses it the way my parents did, and that it really just means ""I have hope"". This spikes my interest, because as much as I love them, my parents are very cold and pessimistic. 

Other examples are the word ""miasto"", I had always thought ""miasto"" meant ""bridge"", and I struggle to get the image of a bridge out of my mind! It's only an assumption that this is where I got the meaning from. 

""Bogata"" is what you call a rich person here in Poland

4 . I've learnt how to use a breadmaker

Ask me anything within reason about the language or the work.  It's been a pretty intense few weeks so I can probably answer any questions you have about the language.

EDIT: About the language.  Sguuxs is a Tsimshian language.  It has roughly three related languages, and one village in Alaska.  It is an ergative absolutive language, with a wide range of ways to form plurals, both of nouns and of verbs.  A noun's position in the sentence is shown in part by its position (VSO or VS, or perhaps I should say VEA, or VA), but also based on what are called connectives.  For example a word preceeding a proper noun will have a t or an s attached to it based on its position.

Another cool attribute is that in transitive sentences the verb is plural or singular in agreement with the object.  Even though that's what would be expected in an ergative language

The language also has phrase suffixes, and wreak havoc as they double up on everything else.  I haven't heard many examples of this yet, and as the lady I'm talking to doesn't have much patience for trying to ask the same thing over and over again, and also remembers everything that has been asked her for the last ten years, I'm mostly just recording as much vocab as possible and trying to get examples along the way in the form of sample sentences.",,False,t5_2qhos,True

I noticed the fact that it was written in the present tense kept me aware that it was a joke with an eventual punchline coming up. Eventually

I know narrative jokes are told in the present tense in English, but it's not a very representative sample. Could present-tense joke telling be a _meme_ that has spread specifically among Western European culture? Is it specific to Indoeuropean languages? Or do other more distant languages also use the present for jokes and the preterite for stories? If so, I think it might be an interesting feature of human nature.

I'm afraid I have no training in linguistics, or even if I'm erroneously assuming the past tense is a global standard for storytelling.

I was just considering what the odds of some of our chatspeak that is currently used almost exclusively online actually entering the English language and changing our vocabulary or grammar.  With the high exposure of today's youth to online media (the average 8-18 year old is plugged into the internet or their mobile device 7.5 hours a day [source](http://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/20/education/20wired.html))

What kind of changes would you expect to see to English in the future thanks to the ""internet culture"" that we're surrounded by?  These are a few ideas I had:

* The use of ""lol"" within or at the end of a sentence to indicate lack of seriousness.  It's already done in written online language (does anyone ever really literally mean ""laughing out loud"" these days?)  *i.e.""Yeah my professor really must love us
* The inclusion of ""nom"" as an eating verb and adjective.  *i.e. ""I was noming my sandwich"" or ""The cake was nom""*
* The occasional replacement of ""o"" with 0 in certain contexts
* ""Hai"" becoming an acceptable spelling of the greeting ""hello"" or ""hi""
