For men

**1. Fashion**

**2. Fitness**

**3. Flirting**

I think if a man can get these bases covered, and be appreciated by women (and men) around him. Just a caveat: this guide is not for men who are especially strong in either one of these areas; it's for beginners who might not have considered the following:

---------


**1. Fashion**

* **Subscribe to /r/malefashionadvice. Check out the side bar for basics

Fashion might make some men feel uncomfortable or indifferent

In business

In dating, your lady will want to be proud of her man; make her proud.

Some pointers: (*These are general pointers. Obviously if everyone followed them to the T, dress age-conciously. If you are a 18 year-old drummer in a band, or a 35 year-old tech start-up CEO, you can dress accordingly. Check out /r/malefashionadvice for more information.*)

* **Glasses**: Something like [wayfarer style](http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_l3nqqnrUhv1qb7unno1_500.jpg) are timeless and quite in fashion right now. If you're wearing something [like these](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/_JBV6BhHmdZA/TYhPZIV8EXI/AAAAAAAAAFg/P8ujv6rZ3Z4/photo.JPG)

* **Basics**: Get some solid color and [plaid button up long sleeve shirts](http://www.gap.com/products/res/mainimg/flannel-plaid-shirt-comet-blue.jpg). Get some straight leg, but it's a safe, clean start; just make sure everything *fits* (probably relatively thin compared to what you might normally wear if you're new to fashion).** Hang your jeans for a day after wearing them to keep them fresh. Generally, you can wear jeans quite a while between washes if you air them out each time (given that you're not sweating excessively or getting sauce / dirt on them).

* **Fit**: Fit is king. All of the fabric should more-or-less be touching your body. [Look at the difference a nice (probably would you'd consider ""tight"") fit does.](http://finestitch.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/what-a-difference-a-tailored-suit-makes.jpg).

* **Accessorize**: Watch, facial hair, piercing, hat (*no fedoras*), etc. Once you get the basics down, start personalizing and expressing yourself

* **Haircut**: In general, or event context. Get some *good* gel or wax. You can style it [spikey](http://www.hairstylesforguys.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/2012-2013-Hairstyles-For-Guys-Mens-31.jpg) although this is admittedly going a bit out of style these days, or like the previous glasses picture: swept up and back (a more classic look; especially recommended for men over 25).

* **Acne**: This is personal preference, but I personally don't really do those things daily (only when really necessary). I just use this clean &amp; clear and have been fine.

* **Grooming**^4: Finger &amp; toe nails should be short (not much white showing). Scrub under them when you shower / wash your hands. Avoid athelete's foot by using products. Let shoes air out at least a day after wearing them (you should cycle in a few pairs of shoes

* **Socks &amp; Underpants**: One day for one pair of socks; no more. I personally recommend [No-show socks](http://www.target.com/p/hanes-premium-white-men-s-socks-10p-no-show-6-12/-/A-14126683#prodSlot=large_1_8). If you're wearing long tube socks

-----------

**2. Fitness**

* **Subscribe to /r/weightroom. Check out the side bar or [click here to get started.](http://www.reddit.com/help/faqs/weightroom#StarterPrograms)**

Start lifting. No matter what your goals are (fat loss, lifting will help dramatically. 

I personally suggest starting with this:

* [Stronglifts 5x5](http://stronglifts.com/) - It's a free program, and you track your success every day you lift.

I'd actually suggest purchasing **Starting Strength (Read Starting Strength, but just for ease of access, I'd recommend signing up at stronglifts, downloading the PDF and getting started tomorrow.

The idea is simple. You do compound lifts that work many muscles at once. If you can do **5 sets of 5 reps** with a weight (*always start with the empty bar to get your form down*), do the same weight next time. If you fail 2 more times (so, a total of 3 days on the same weight), drop the weight by 10lbs / 5kg next time.

You only end up doing 3 lifts a session

Keep your calorie intake lower ~~unless you're quite low fat % and want to start bulking~~ **if you are overweight or are skinny-fat and want to get rid of flab before bulking up. If you want to get muscularly bigger

* Lots of meat - If you don't / can't

* Lots of veggies - Also I suggest supplementing with One-A-Day men's health formula vitamins if necessary

* Fatty foods are ay-okay - just make sure your total calories aren't too high (if you're trying to slim down)

* **If you want to lose weight**^3 Avoid carbs except on lift days. Consider carbs (pasta, sugary drinks) as simply sugar. They are very calorie dense and don't add much nutritional value. You don't need to [eliminate all carbs (although this is a good way to lose weight, aka Ketosis / ""Atkins"" diet)](http://www.reddit.com/r/keto), but simply consciously limiting them is a great way to lose fat. **Otherwise eat yer carbs to keep your calories up, especially on lift days .**^3

--------

**3. Flirting**

* **Purchase [""Models: Attract women through honesty""](http://www.amazon.com/Models-Attract-Women-Through-Honesty/dp/1463750358) via Amazon Kindle app for your smartphone/computer right now. Start reading.** (or buy a physical copy. I suggest digital so you don't stall or forget; get it now)

If you're a 25, help is on the way! 

First off, it'll open your eyes and help you genuinely improve; it's honest and genuine. ""Pick-up"" books are, in my opinion, band-aid short-term solutions that are complicated and a bit unnecessary. Here are some of the bigger points from *Models*:

* **Be non-needy** - Don't be needy. Don't be so invested in what a girl thinks of you. I'm *not* saying to be a douche or ""alpha male."" But if you approach a girl totally invested in her opinion and holding your breath hoping for a good answer: you're being needy (and probably creepy). Instead approach a girl with the idea of ""*I wonder if she's interesting*"" instead of ""*I wonder if she'll like me*"".

* **Be vulnerable** - Don't take the safe, and she'll be impressed (and relieved) by you. **Be genuine. Take risks you might not have before, but don't just do it for sake of doing it; do it if you like her and are connecting with her. Don't do it just to ""go out and game tonight"" or something.**^2

What do we mean by being vulnerable? Here are some examples:

1. Walking up to a girl to introduce yourself. - You risk rejection. By simply going up and saying ""Hi! My name's billy. I saw you chilling out and just *had* to introduce myself"", and conquering it.

2. Grabbing a girl by the hand and bringing her to the bar - You risk rejection or coming on too strong. **You'd only do this after getting to know her a bit and knowing that she's interested in you as well as you genuinely being interested in her.**^1

3. Jumping on the stage to dance with your silly buddies - You risk looking stupid or losing social standing

4. Teasing her about her cute little nose - You risk her being offended or not liking you anymore. This also shows non-neediness

5. Standing your ground and disagreeing with her about something you genuinely disagree about - You risk her not liking you. Don't be a dick about it

6. Playfully smacking her butt / twirling her / lifting her up - You risk coming on too strong, you're not needy, and you embrace your sexuality (and it's just plain fun) **You'd only do these after getting to know her a bit and knowing that she's interested in you as well as you genuinely being interested in her.**^1

Make an emotional connection; learn how to converse. If you find you have awkward silences in your conversation, independance, cuisine, school, learning). Connect emotionally, be physical.

1373723772.0,1i7txz,Why teenagers should not be posting on this subreddit.,archaicmosaic,506,114,88,"I have two big concerns about teenagers posting on this subreddit. 

Concern #1

When you go through puberty as a teenager, you are stuck in the weird limbo of being physically and mentally in a state of constant flux. This is why being a teenager is so painful. You are in the midst of an identity crisis. As your body and mind are both changing, your perception of yourself is also changing. As you start getting more interested in what your peers and members of the opposite sex think of you, you start getting way more obsessed with your own appearance. 

Take me for example.

When I was a teenager, and I was chubby. Yay. Now apart from taking care of my skin and going on the pill, waiting, and growing a bit more while going to the gym and eating healthily, there just wasn't a whole lot I could do about my appearance at the time. Also, as a teenager, I had little to no control over my financial situation, because I had NO taste). Being a teenager was very difficult. It's difficult for everybody. Every comment anyone made about me and my appearance resonated in my mind for hours

However!

I look back at photos of myself now

Here are some before/after pics of me so you can see what I mean:

Me circa age 16

Me age 22

Me

Anyway, and the person I saw in my mind's eye was even more so. This is the same for all teenagers! Your body is going through so many physical and mental changes right now that you really are not in any good position to know what you look like. So, you shouldn't worry about it so much! Also, be comforted that everyone comes out the other end of puberty as an adult, and eventually you will settle into your new body and feel comfortable in it, and find your own style and way of self expression. So you really shouldn't be asking people on reddit ""Am I ugly?"" because your face and body are still changing and reddit will not know what the end result will be!

So don't worry so much about it!

Concern #2 will not be so long. 

My second concern goes out to all the redditors giving criticism (constructive or otherwise) to teenagers. These kids are at a very delicate age, is reinforcing a message that their appearance is the most important thing about them (even if that is not the poster's intention). My grandfather once made an offhand remark to my older sister about her ""puppy fat"" when she was about 12. She's 30 now, she still struggles to manage her eating disorder. 

Kids at this age should be encouraged to spend more time focusing on their futures, your skills, your experience, your education: THAT is your future. 

TL;DR

1. You never look as bad as a teenager as you think you do.
2. Everyone grows up and finds their own style
3. Don't give teenagers feedback about their appearance. It's reinforcing messages that their looks are the most important thing about them

**Commenters:**

1. This isn't a rateme sub. That would be /r/rateme. Here it's encouraged to give advice and details along with your opinions, and ""yes, ugly"". You gotta write something.

2. We don't question peoples' motives here as long as they're not posting excessively (more than once a month without any major changes). Please don't accuse people of using the sub as a hugbox just because they're attractive.

3. Anything that looks like personal information digging gets you a ban and reported to the admins.

4. Be honest but have some tact. Don't be a dick. Stay classy. (Telling people about how you're touching yourself isn't classy.)

**Submitters:**

1. No nudes. Keep it SFW.

2. Don't post pictures that aren't of you. That means none of your girlfriend, try to keep other people out of them, again because of privacy but also because it can get confusing for commenters.

7. Better photos get better feedback. Try to take them at arms' length away

6. Don't use Facebook or photobucket as a photo host. They're insecure and can be used to stalk you. Posts using them get removed for your safety.

4. Don't use this place as a hugbox. There's no way for us to tell, but please, if you just want someone to make you feel better, try [/r/mmfb](/r/mmfb) which is designed for exactly that purpose (and would love to have you)!

8. [Edit your thread to remove the photos afterwards.](http://www.reddit.com/r/amiugly/comments/ptvuc/how_to_delete_your_postphotos_from_ramiugly/) Don't delete the post

3. Don't post more than like

5. If you want to talk about the subreddit, and we're the only ones who are going to change anything anyway. **OR** post it in one of the **new** weekly meta megathreads! Unconstructive meta-posts like ""everyone here is pretty what the fuck"" and ""you're all attention whores"" just get removed.

--------------

**[Last time on /r/amiugly...](http://www.reddit.com/r/amiugly/comments/qmd8d/meta_megathread_1_lets_talk_about_ugliness/)** we tried to talk about definitions of attractiveness and ugliness, body weight, hygiene, genetics, [similarity to the average](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koinophilia), and hair length. Also proposed were more subjective properties like one's attitude, aesthetic, self-awareness

**Many of our submitters are underage, including me. Folks said we should have a referendum on whether to restrict the subreddit to users 18 or older. We may yet do that. 

But first

* teenagers are fragile and this experience may harm them
* teens are not done growing so any judgement is bound to be inaccurate
* teens are vain/shallow as it is and this will only exacerbate that
* teens may have serious psychological disorders (anorexia
* teens are idiotic and they shit up the place
* teens are many and have a lot of free time and clog up the place
* teens are generally just looking for attention
* teen insecurity will pass naturally (and thus doesn't need /r/amiugly's help)
* it's creepy for any adults to talk about teens being attractive in any context including this one
* this forum could attract pedophiles and aid them in doing bad things
* teens should be doing their homework anyway

Pretty damning. 

[I made some arguments against prohibition.](http://www.reddit.com/r/amiugly/comments/qmd8d/meta_megathread_1_lets_talk_about_ugliness/c3z828y) Summarized:

* teens are already anxious about their looks. we can help quell that anxiety so that they can worry about other actually important things
* we can't practically enforce an age restriction
* if this place becomes age-restricted
* while they are here we can challenge their concern with looks and engage them about it

And that's where we left off. This is the main topic of this thread

-----------------------------------

Other minor business:

The sidebar is hella long and unwieldy, and that instead of the rules inline we have an eye-catching advertisement-like image that hotlinks to another image which is an illustrated version of the rules. (If any of you have talent and want to make either of these it'd be much appreciated.) While usually I like to have rules right there on every page, in this case there's so many that I think a lot of folks' brains just shut off, and it'd be cool to experiment with the whole rule infographic kind of thing anyway. We're also going to get megathreads stickied to the top of the page with CSS, hopefully.

We're thinking about adding a new moderator: [RichardBachman](http://www.reddit.com/user/richardbachman). If any of you have any reasons why he and [/r/amiugly](/r/amiugly) shouldn't be joined in holy moderatory speak now or forever hold your peace.

1331158965.0,qmd8d,META MEGATHREAD #1: Let's talk about ugliness.,joke-away,203,35,65,"(Upvote this so it's visible

Every month we get a couple of meta posts talking about how everyone here is pretty, or everyone here is really bad at judging what everyone here is. And we mods have been removing them because they're crap. They aren't interesting, they lead to no interesting discussion, and generally they're made by people who have been here all of fifteen minutes. And they take up space.

But at the same time, many of them underaged, and are sent out the door having been judged by a small group of people based solely on their looks. Is that right?

I think that, we do need to at least discuss some things, together. But, so that it doesn't get out of hand, it's going to be in one weekly megathread, so it's easily ignored if it's not what your interested in.

Now

1. What is ugliness? What do you look for as far as attractiveness? Is it all looks?

2. What should the next megathread be about? 

3. Any other questions or concerns about this whole megathread thing.

Ok go.

Oh and one rule, so that it's easier to keep track of what's coming from inside the subreddit and what's from without.

I have been told I look like a light skinned Jay Z. As you can imagine, that everyone else noticed my snozz too.

I cut off my relaxed hair about a year and a half ago because I figured I was ugly whether I had straight or natural hair. Had my cousin mock me for looking like a guy back when it was still short.

I feel my features are too large for my face. My nose is big and my lips are big and it just makes me look ridiculously disproportionate. I'm incredibly jealous of white and black girls who look gorgeous

I just want to state a few things.

 * This subreddit was started so that people may ask others how they look
 * We want to foster a good atmosphere. It's unfortunate that the moderators do not have time to read every comment, PM me])
 * That said, sorry.
 * The only comments I remove without scrutiny are those that encourage suicide (a surprising number of people love to recommend this) and those that are purposefully hateful (whether it be on the basis of race
 * The fastest way to have your submission removed is for it to be NSFW / obviously not you. Sure
 * Lastly, please read the guidelines above new post. It gives you pointers on how to take a photo that is going to be better for you in the long run. Posting dishonest angles (myspace angles) or otherwise obscuring something about yourself is simply doing yourself a disservice (if you want the truth, anyway.)

Please stop posting on AmIUgly! I leave the same comment every time, which look awkward now because *you are still a kid*. Please allow yourself some time to grow into your features and develop as a person.

The fact that you have not dated in X amount of time or haven't had a serious relationship is not indicative of any exterior ugliness, making your own decisions and supporting yourself. This means that, while some lucky (or unlucky, as I prefer to look at it, since it never ends well) few will find some teenage romance, for the most part you are not ready for any form of serious relationship. If you seriously disagree with that point, please assume that most of the girls/boys your age might be dealing with such an issue.

Give yourself some time. Join clubs, do whatever you need to do, but do not fall victim to the ridiculous Twilight fantasy that you need to find the one you love before your senior year or your life sucks.

Also understand that finding a girlfriend/boyfriend will not actually make you happier. It's true! If you struggle with loneliness

Learn to be in the company of friends and form fulfilling non-romantic relationships. That's what the teen years are for! (That and getting caught jerking it by your mom.)

My point is, if by nothing else than your own brute will, and if you can learn to be a happy and healthy individual, there is no doubt that you will someday find another happy and healthy individual to share experiences with.

Until then

Love

Being morbidly obese for most of my life I still have a lot of issues now with self image. I have guys who think I'm attractive but with them being friends or nerds I tend to think they're just saying that or how low standards. 

As to the title I hate how I look in photos if I don't take them. Photos taken by me are fine and when I look in the mirror I don't think I look bad. However most photos my friends take I look like a different hideous person. I'm wondering if I'm just not photogenic or maybe I'm really that ugly.

Being overweight and a tom boy my whole life means fashion and make up are not my forte. I think I'm starting to develop a sense of style but I feel uncomfortable in a lot of the popular current fashion trends which I don't think helps my confidence much. I also hold myself to way too high of a standard sometimes

5'8 / 175lbs / US Clothing size 8/10 / 40-30-40 / 36D

Perceived flaws: Aysmetrical wide face, big calves, and waist isn't small enough to pull off the hour glass.

Also hair advice would be helpful I'm growing it out but not sure where to go from there. I'm very aware I need to get new glasses. Frame suggestions would be appreciated.

TL;DR Am I not photogenic or just ugly? Hair and glasses advice is good too. Also do I really look young? I get told I look anywhere from 16 to 19.

**Edit 2** Thanks for the comments so far everyone. I am reading them and will probably get the time to properly respond after work :)

**Edit 3** I knew the smile would come up... I don't know how to smile naturally. When I smile for pictures my face actually hurts and anything beiyond a neutral/slight smirk brings out horrible lines in my cheeks that just look bad. Got any smiling tips? 

Thanks for the glasses suggestions. I may consider contacts it's just I'm so used to wearing glasses I do not know if that would look good.

I'll do a follow up post next week with comparison pics of glasses smiling vs no glasses. I'd do it today but a very angry bee ran into my lip while biking yesterday. I look like a botched botox job right now.

Gonna save myself some time here I usually get my eyebrows done so trust me I know that one helps alot. I do appreciate the make up tips tho.

UPDATE: OMG so many more comments than I expected. Let me say that you can't imagine how happy and relieved these comments made me feel and I know that I definitely need to make some changes. Right now I would say that I'm in a transitional period in my life because to be honest last year was a pretty bad year for me but things started to turn around for me around December. So right now I'm trying to better myself and that's why posted here and it was pretty hard for me to do so but I'm soooo happy I did.

Any ways I can improve on this? I always thought about getting my gap filled.



edit: I know a lot of people don't think this belongs here but in all honesty I wouldn't know. I take a lot of photos until I can find one I'm semi satisfied with because I don't see me as a whole I just see everything that is wrong.
I feel like if I was to explain the deep root problems to my problems I'd be attention seeking.. but I'll say a little
I feel better seeing it from the perspective of your eye because I trust your eye more then I trust my own.

**EDIT** – FAQs

*Why not just lock the post at 30 comments but leave it up?*  
This is not an option Reddit offers. Deleting the post allows the OP to still see it

*Why does it matter if a few popular posts are at the top? There's lots of unpopular ones just a little further down.*  
Because most of /r/amiugly's 30K subscribers only see the top 1 or 2 posts mixed in on their frontpage

*Won't people just game this system?*  
Well, so the majority of users won't know about it. It'll also be silently enforced – people aren't notified when their post is deleted. We have several such ""silent policies"" already in place to avoid gaming systems.

1364385952.0,1b3t1j,[17/f] It is hard for me to tell.,anakedape,92,22,133,"Many people say that I am attractive. However I feel as though I am being lied to. Or I am lying to myself. Sometimes I stare at myself in the mirror for very long periods of time

I have a weird sort of obsession with the male body and its strength and I would also like to be very strong but I always seem to be quite weak. I try to work out often but my arms do not morph into the shape I want them to and my legs remain curvy. At these times I truly do wish I were male and I feel very very ugly.

I have very low self esteem because of these conflicting messages I send to myself. I am always telling myself that I should remain feminine and flirty and that I should wear dresses and that I should open my eyes wide and be cute, that I should be able to fight a man and win, that I should be able to run two miles and not get tired, that I should be able to feel only muscle on my body. So then when I see a mirror I see curves and feminine features and I feel softness around my thighs and stomach and I hate that. Then when I am telling myself to be feminine I see more tendons in my neck and muscles on my body than I would like and I hate that. This also translates to my face. I have a hard time recognizing my face, or, I mean.. I have a hard time seeing the same person twice, so that each time I look in the mirror I look like someone different

I don't know what to do. Do I look weak? Is my face very masculine (ugly for a female)? Is it very feminine (not ugly for a female)? What do I look like to you? 

1. This is when I was feeling feminine. http://i.imgur.com/6yzOvfX.jpg

2. This is when I was feeling masculine. http://i.imgur.com/OkmRTdO.jpg 

I think there is a large difference in the two. Does my nose not look more masculine in the second photo? 


3. Here is my arm. Is it weak (ugly) or strong (not ugly)? http://i.imgur.com/QtxD2Bw.jpg

4. This is my torso and most of my legs. http://i.imgur.com/DXZMbYk.jpg  I neither look feminine nor masculine in this photo and that bothers me.

1341973320.0,wd360,Been meaning to do this for a while now: THANK YOU amiugly!,mtpeach,107,40,12,"This post is long overdue

I posted here several months ago, forehead, skin tone, everything. I was doing everything I could to look my best, I wore makeup, was trying out new hairstyles, and smiled with my mouth closed as I hated my teeth and the way I looked when I smiled. I am 19, and had never received any (non-intoxicated) male attention

So I took a few pictures in my bathroom and posted them on here. I got mostly nice responses, that they thought it looked ""judgmental"", ""cold"", and ""off-putting"". Out of all the criticisms I was expecting to get that one just really threw me offguard. But I trusted the community and started practicing my ""terrible"" open mouthed smile I hadn't used since before puberty. It felt really awkward at first but after tons of persistence and awkward moments in front of the mirror it started feeling more natural. All of a sudden I learned what my best smile looked like (and I also learned how I should absolutely not smile). I posted on here again with my open mouthed smile, not having tried it out in public, and got drastically different responses.

That's when I started being a lot less self-conscious about who I was and what I looked like. I don't think it was JUST my smile, not expecting anything from him though he kept saying he was going to take me out on a date the following day. I just thought it was the alcohol, that he'd be telling his friends about the ugly chick he'd been with the night before. So imagine my surprise when he actually did message me the next day asking if I wanted to go to the movies with him. Well, I was even more shocked when he turned out to be the absolute sweetest (and hottest) guy ever and how well we got along.

What drew him to me in the first place? My smile, actress or singer. But he makes me feel beautiful and I can honestly say that if I had not posted on here that I would not be in the position I am in now. It wasn't just about the smile, it was about the confidence that comes with it and I think it just gave me a little bit of a confidence boost to put myself out there. At work I've been smiling with my new smile and my coworkers have started accepting me more, they actually chat with me now, and my classmates have started greeting me in the halls. Customers are also much nicer. I didn't realize my smile was scaring people off and no one but the people on here were even willing to tell me that. And for that, people of amiugly, I will be forever thankful. :]

I know some people may be rolling their eyes at this post, appearance does matter. Presentation does matter. And a lot of the time people are too nice to say anything. Just being able to connect with somebody and not feeling like you're scum, actually feeling beautiful for the first time in your post-adolescent life, it's empowering. I can't even describe it. This is getting to be way too long but thank you, thank you, thank you again amiugly. This community may have its flaws but you guys really are making a difference. I'm sorry that some people can't see past the community's name (which tends to get a lot of juvenile jokes) and see what it really does for people.",,self,,

I can't state enough how amazing and surprising this was. I'm still quite despairing of ever finding anyone as hot/ intelligent/ compatible as her- there are slim pickings here....but maybe one day!

I've been on r/amiugly for a while now, here, is that we can't always tell if you people look good or bad. So here's a few tricks you can base yourself on to get a maximum of feedback.

**Have a full body picture**

I know some of you like taking headshot photos

**Wear your everyday clothes**

Yes, but it doesn't hurt to try here also.

**Point out what part of you you want feedback**

This usually makes it easier to judge upon since people are often obsessed over this one part of their body. Do take notice that this **does not** imply that you should go for plastic surgery

**Use an Imgur album instead of multiple links**

I may just be difficult on this

Well that's pretty much what I have for now,False,self,t5_2rgjh,False,,,t3_ubcxp

I look at some of the guys here and I'm fucking jealous of how you look, the good kind of chatting up. Er, usually.

However

**SMILE!**
You all look like someone just insulted your puppy.  The majority of looking good is confidence - give us a smile like you just fucked the hottest person in the word

This goes the same for real life.  People want to fuck people that are smiling - if you are smiling, I want to know what it is and probably will sleep with you/date you/be your friend/whatever to find out.  Because chances are, that person you think is too hot to talk to is NOT smiling.  Make them happy.  You want to make them happy, right?  Yes, yes you do.


**GIVE US BETTER PICTURES.**

* Lighting is vital.  Don't. Put. Dark. Pictures. Here.  You'll look awful!
* No cell phone pictures - EVERYONE looks ugly in cell phone pictures!
* Get a good bit away from the camera.  Surely you're not ugly enough you can't figure out how to set the delay on your phone
* A couple of face shots are great

**HAIRCUT!**
This mainly goes for the guys here.  Try and give us a picture that doesn't make it look like a weed-whacker just tried to make love to your 'do - unless that is a good ""look"" on you.  And it likely isn't.  You will look better with a decent haircut.

**CONFIDENCE!**
Okay, that's too long.  But you get my point - virtually everyone here is good enough looking to not be ""forever alone,"" or fuck, even ""alone through the end of the week.""  

Y'all can head to [/r/fitness](www.reddit.com/r/fitness) or [/r/loseit](www.reddit.com/r/loseit) if you think you need more muscle/less fat.  Those two subreddits really shaped my butt up (both my real but

But seriously - put on some awesome, do your makeup (if that's your thing), listen to your favorite ""get amped"" song and go to the nearest bar with people your age.  Smile.  Make eye contact.  Talk to attractive people at the bar.  If it doesn't make you feel better after trying to talk to 5 people in a night, come back here and I'll personally give you a goddamned makeover, fitness program, and whatever else it takes to get that strategy to work for you.

You're all beautiful.

we debated whether young people should be allowed to post here. Most people understood that any strict rules would be counter-productive and difficult to enforce, and providing an audience for pedophiles.

You have spoken, as you did before, by telling the submitter why they shouldn't be worried about such things.

------------------------------

###Today's Topic:

There isn't one. It's exam crunch time for me and a couple of the other mods, maybe making it the topic of the next megathread.

-------------------------

###Other news:

**Automoderator** has been added as a mod to this subreddit. He is a bot, modmail or here in the megathread), and approve threads by folks with a lot of karma. Don't worry, if your thread gets removed he'll tell you why, and you can always message us mods if you think it's undeserved. That means hopefully no more getting stuck in the spam queue!

But it also means your **reports** are even more important. If you see a thread or comment that breaks the rules of the subreddit or is trollish

The **CSS** has been changed as described in the last thread

I've added in blackstar9000's vote faders

I've also put the rules in their own thread and linked to it in an image in the sidebar, they're more likely to click on pictures, I think. The image itself was made by me in paint.net in 20 seconds. It's temporary, so make a better one and we'll add it in! Otherwise, I'll go poking around and see what I can drum up. Anyway, if you and/or my fellow mods think that was a bad move, just say so and I'll revert it. 

Oh, in the hopes that this will make people more likely to leave longer comments. Worth a try.

To make a long story a little less long, because I cut my hair really short and only wore baggy, boyish clothes until I graduated high school. I was mistaken for a boy on an almost daily basis, but I found a weird kind of solace in it, almost as though it made me exempt from ridicule if I didn't try.

Fast forward to college: I started growing my hair out and dressing nicer. I get a little bit of male attention now, but the thought is terrifying (I have a giant forehead, my eyebrows are uneven, and my nose is big/hooked). I'm genuinely concerned, so throw politeness out the window and let me have it.

I've been lurking here for a while and I've finally bit the bullet. I know I'm not that bad looking and I understand that any flaws I have with getting dates is based in periodic lapses of confidence. (If I'm myself around the ladies, bullying all that jazz. I've grown past all that stuff and I'm pretty happy these days! Except I've never felt like I've been in the relm of being physically attractive. So i'm curious what your first impression is.

So if you have compliments, or showing how fit I am under the t-shirt (swimming everyday + abs workouts ;), but I tend to be the guy taking pictures instead of being in them :P. 

Thanks for your time!

1334733508.0,sfosa,Da Rules (updated),joke-away,55,8,26,"###Read These Rules You Gits

---------

###Commenting:

1. **Don't post ""3/10"" or ""would fuck"".** This isn't a rateme sub. That would be /r/rateme. Here it's encouraged to give advice and details along with your opinions, and ""yes, ugly"". You gotta write something.

2. **Don't question motives** here as long as they're not posting excessively (more than once a month without any major changes). Please don't accuse people of using the sub as a hugbox just because they're attractive.

3. **Don't dig up personal info.** Anything that looks like personal information digging gets you a ban and reported to the admins. Don't do it. Ever.

4. Be honest but **have some tact.** Don't be a dick. Stay classy. (Telling people about how you're touching yourself isn't classy.)

5. Try to comment on people of your own sex once in a while. Don't worry, so try to share the love.

6. **Don't send creepy private messages** to submitters. What's creepy? Professing your undying love, and invitations to be strokin'.

###Submitting:

1. **If you're under 16, it's no big deal. Go outside and have fun!

7. **Better photos get better feedback.** Try to take them at arms' length away

6. **Don't use Facebook or photobucket** as a photo host. They're insecure and can be used to stalk you. Posts using them get removed for your safety. Threads that do this get autoremoved by AutoModerator.

1. **No nudes.** Keep it SFW.

2. **Don't post pictures that aren't of you.** That means none of your friend or significant other, the person posting the photos, are also the person in the photos. The easiest form of proof is a [picture of you including the day's date.](http://i.imgur.com/IFG1FgC.png) This is to prevent abusive posting of others' photos as a form of harassment. If you don't include proof your post will be removed if reported.

4. **Don't use this place as a hugbox.** There's no way for us to tell, but please, if you just want someone to make you feel better, try [/r/mmfb](/r/mmfb) which is designed for exactly that purpose (and would love to have you)!

8. **[Edit your thread to remove the photos afterwards.](http://www.reddit.com/r/amiugly/comments/ptvuc/how_to_delete_your_postphotos_from_ramiugly/)** Don't just delete the post

3. **Don't post more than once a month

5. **If you want to talk about the subreddit, and we're the only ones who are going to change anything anyway. **OR** post it in one of the **new** weekly meta megathreads! Unconstructive meta-posts like ""everyone here is pretty what the fuck"" and ""you're all attention whores"" just get removed anyway.

9. **No joke threads.** There's too many possible jokes, M1, F-16, F-18, F-20, F-22, F-35, pat yourself on the back for being clever

###Voting:

* **Don't upvote/downvote based on appearance.** Upvote/downvote based on whether the person needs more responses. If the person has few responses

###Auxiliary subreddits :

* Check out /r/bodyacceptance for discussion about lookism and how a person's value depends on more than their appearance. Also if you're having trouble dealing with how you look.

* If you don't feel you're ugly try [r/AmISexy](http://reddit.com/r/AmISexy).

* If you need opinions on your fashion taste: Ladies please visit /r/femalefashionadvice

* If you need tips and opinions about your hair: Ladies visit [r/FancyFollicles](http://reddit.com/r/FancyFollicles)

* If you have any dermatological problems please visit [r/Health](http://reddit.com/r/Health). If you'd like to lose weight try /r/loseit

**What I'm working on**
*Used to be a endurance runner so I got stuck at 5'8 about 130 pounds.  I'm working on eating more and lifting to get bigger.

*I'd like to get my teeth whitened.  I drink a lot of soda and coffee and it has done a lot on my teeth.  I don't like to smile.

*Taking yoga class.  I like the strength/flexibility and it doesn't hurt that the class is full of women.  Makes me feel good/gets me out of the house

*I constantly struggle with acne

I'm a 21-year-old Asian woman who has *never* been hit on or asked out, and chubby (110-20 lb), with a Jackie Chan nose and tiny eyes and a wide face run over multiple times by the acne truck, I've always assumed it was my looks. Even my parents make fun of how ugly I am (as I look NOTHING like my pale model-esque mother), and men constantly ignore me in conversations when my prettier friends are there. 

My self-esteem's taken a pretty big hit over the years as every Y-chromosome-possessor my age has either friendzoned or avoided me. I try not to let it get to me, 'EW NO THIS FUGLY IS HITTING ON ME!' since I see this all the time (including on Reddit) when guys mention fat or ugly girls. 

I asked my closest friend and she told me I should only approach as a desperate last resort - if the guy were even slightly interested

I just don't know what to do. I can't afford a boob job or surgery for my acne scars, it just hurts when you're nearly 22 and *STILL* haven't gotten to second base, much less lost your virginity. :(

People posting on this subreddit always say in their posts that they've never gotten attention from the opposite sex, whatever, and it pisses me off. This is partially your own fault. ANYBODY can be attractive if they TAKE CARE OF THEMSELVES THE RIGHT WAY.

I've noticed the majority of females on here don't do anything with their hair, and then wonder why they don't get attention. As bad as it sounds, most of the time you will get more attention from guys if you make yourself look cute. Sorry, it's the truth. And when you look good, you feel good, so there ya go. Everyone wins.

Guys are just as bad. They don't clean themselves up. Their hair is either too long

Few months ago I was in a depressed mood and decided to make a post here so I could see what people really thought about me. Turns out I wasn't that bad but my hair was pretty off putting. So basically the advice I got last time were two categories: grab some flannels and grow a twisty moustache and be a hipster or shave and cut my hair. So I did! I bought a trimmer and took off the stache and cleaned off my beard and got a new hair cut. I also started lifting weights

Sorry for the poor quality on some of those. 

I usually describe myself as ""passably cute"", or compliments on just my eyes, but never hot or sexy. 

I think my biggest problem lies in my bulbous, but there was nothing they could do about the size of my front teeth. I've been giving thoughts to a nose job to fix the shape of my nose and for my teeth either veneers to make them all proportional at least, or even something drastic like  tooth shaving and reshaping. Think I should go for it?

I would like to point out that I suffer from trichotillomania (compulsive hair-pulling) and dermotillomania (compulsive skin-picking), I know I'm overweight.

Constructive criticism would be nice. :)

Although I'm really only speaking for myself here (although I'm sure the other mods will agree with the general tone of my argument), in recent months I've seen more and more examples of people leaving with general tips on how to improve themselves. I've noticed more and more submissions doing comeback submissions a few months later after using the advice they were given, and these sort of submissions that show a real positive, tangible effect on people's lives are particularly heartening.

However

Bear that in mind next time you want to call someone ""an ugly bitch/slut""

Sincerely

Scrumpy.

I used to weigh [290 pounds] (http://i.imgur.com/uep6RjN.jpg) and be sickly and be horribly out of shape. I wore a size 48 pants, Kit Kats, Skittles). My diet consisted of massive amounts of so much unhealthy. 

Around August of last year, pics, and all that so sorry. But I was told, bluntly, I was ugly. Yes, at first it hurt like a bitch. It did. I got mad. I got defensive. And overall it just sucked. The next day though I woke and felt like I was ready to make a change. So I did. I cut my hair, shaved my terrible beard, I had to do it.

Today I am a different man. I am now 180 pounds, and eat better. All because of this subreddit. So now I am here to tell you, the person who is reading this sad and lonely, that it can be done. Just try. Keep trying. And everything will be alright.

I've also been hearing about some pretty hurtful things that some ""friends"" have said about me lately and it just makes things so much worse for me. Even my parents have said some things so me.

Hi.

I used to be pretty big (196lbs at 5'5""!) and managed to lose 42lbs and become a size 10-12. I looked great

I'm also insecure about certain features, my feet, my hands, my skin discolouration on my face. I am pretty self critical in my head. But not alarmingly so, I don't think so. I also have depression, anxiety, was severely bullied for most of my childhood and have had a hard time growing up as a teenager

So I guess I'm just looking for some opinions on my physical appearence right now. Here are some more shots

About a week ago I lost my first kiss to some boy at a party who I thought was nice and stuff but it turns out that he's just a player and not anyone I want to associate with in the long run. :(

Now, the past couple years, I've gained some weight. I'm not overweight but I'm not skinny anymore. I have a very athletic body and I hate it. I love the sports I play but I love the lithe look and very skinny girls.  Ever since one of my (male) best friends abandoned me earlier this year (I really liked him) and since that boy at the party last week was only using me, I've been feeling very down about myself. It also doesn't help that I'm 6'0"" and about 160 lbs. I'm pretty much the biggest of my friends in college by a lot. I just want to know if I should be feeling down about myself or if there are other reasons that I haven't ever been asked out.

 Whilst I enjoy my work etc its not who I am so thought a change of hair

Im shy. I dont like looking in mirrors. I dont like photos. I feel like a gumpy wierdo

Last few months have led to weight-gain... im not uncomfortable with being larger now but most of the people I work with have commented that they think the hair, weight and glasses being pretty common round the office now. 

Is this them not being down with my lifestyle? Or am I actually ugly now? as a shy and naturally worried person I am now paranoid that I am some kind of hideous outcast from the normal world. 

So. Reddit. I am looking for some constructive criticism and honesty. Has the haircut and weightgain been unkind to me? 

Are there any ways you can see of me incorporating who I am into a look which would be attractive?

EDIT: Thanks everyone for the honest feedback! 

On the whole the consensus I think has been that the weight gain has been bad. check. that the old me looked more confident. check. and that the haircut has about 50% support. But that it hasnt turned me into a hidous beast.

Now that you've seen pictures, in case you couldn't tell. I'm transitioning from Male to Female so for any criticism you're going to give me, please apply it to me as if I had been born female.

I have had no surgeries yet and have only been on hormones (Estrogen and an anti-androgen) for 14 months. I started hormone replacement therapy at 19 years old.

The reason I came here for criticism is because I'm afraid all of the feedback I've gotten from friends and family or other trans people is too nice and ""sugarcoated"" because people don't want to hurt my feelings. My mom tells me all the time ""You look like a girl!"" but most of the time I have a hard time seeing it myself.


To those of you planning on replying:

* Please be honest and above all

* Please use female pronouns because that is what I identify as. 

* If you could, don't bother).

Read on if you want more info
--------------------------------------------------------

I used to be more shy

The only universal in my life has been that no matter how good of a job I do or how much I try I am never worth more than the dirt I stand on to women and to many others in general. 

I get compliments on my approaches relatively often

My most typical experience is to just be completely ignored or to, it's quite common for me to be getting along well with a woman only to have her suddenly go silent and seemingly drop off the edge of the world, leaving me clueless. I don't do offensive things or anything, I'm quite sure.

I feel like the only explanation at this point is that people are judging me based only on my experience and that I must be ugly. How else could everything I've done by now have not worked? I've truly gone above and beyond and it gets me nowhere. If I was attractive than something would have worked by now. I could just go on and on with all the things I've tried: everything from meeting at least 1 new woman every other day for several years, to talking to women in class (and getting along well too), but nothing ever works.

I've never had any real experience with love. I'm going to explode. This has tormented me for years. I can barely focus on school work. My whole college life and young adult life has been nothing but misery because of it.

Nobody give me any ""you need to love yourself before you can love someone else"" stuff. I've loved myself this entire time. I've been unwaveringly confident

When I ask women have told me either that I'm ""not ugly""

However, and alone. I deserve better than this. I've alreadly completely lost the joy of my young 20s and of my entire college experience... I can't live with losing anymore of it. I need something to change soon.

I need some help. Above all I need someone out there to actually give me a chance. I've never in my whole life been sure that anyone loved me. I'm passionate about life and my career (computer science

There's never been 1 day in my whole life that I've ever felt the kind of joy I see others experiencing constantly around me everywhere

I constantly feel like my whole life and youth is slipping away from me and there's nothing I can do to stop it

Please help me. I can't take it anymore. In 24 years of living why is it I feel like I haven't ever even lived a week. My life is a prison that keeps me from happiness. People say love who you are and what you do, telling me I just have to love myself when I already DO, and that I just need to meet more people when I already DO, and that I'm not ugly when everything I've ever been through and struggled with implies strongly that I am. But, the perpetual confusion and endless misery continues. I'm not trying to throw a pity party (that's another thing people tell me when I bring this up). I hate pity parties. I've just spent my whole life trying to make this work and it never does. I NEED it to work. 

I can't take this anymore. I can hardly bear even one more hour of it. Please help me. Nothing I do changes anything. I've tried everything I can in my power to do and nothing happens. Nobody understands. I can't just wait this out the slow way like many suggest. That would be a disaster. I must be proactive

I need someone to not judge me for my lack of romantic experience and see the truth that I just need to be given a chance. Or at least perhaps that's what I hope: that this is all some insane anamoly of behavior. But who can argue with hundreds of rejections? I've always loved myself and have been confident and calm but it hasn't ever worked. I've been emotionally starving for years. I need something to change. I can't take this anymore

Please help me.......

I am sorry for the post length, meaninglessjust like me in the eyes of everyone in the world it seems, regardless of how much I love and have confidence in myself. Every time there seems to be hope it is smashed. Every time a trust, I am betrayed. Everytime I think the hell might end it doesn't. I can't do this anymore... It's killing me. My life is wasting away and nothing I do does anything to stop it.............

What's true and what isn't? I don't know anymore. I've never been loved... I'm spinning my wheels on ice. I can't escape. I'm stuck in this prison that is my life. Why doesn't what I do change anything? It doesn't make sense. It should have worked by now. Will my misery ever end? I deserve better... What can I do? I don't understand. Nothing makes any sense. I""ve longed my whole life for compansionship and have never had it. Everything only leads back to more pain. Will I ever have a day where I get to feel loved by someone? It seems like I won't...

I don't know what to do... or what to think... or even what's real and what's not...

Most of you seem to be great people that give good, if they would be living in sweden

So what I am saying is that many of us non-americans seem to come off as douchebags and get downvoted when the fact is we have never met a person that big in our whole life. It is difficult to be ""nice"" to someone who passed the chubby level 50-100 lbs ago. I want to put up some examples but that would just be wrong to the posters ""tactwise"". Just look at the front page and you will probably find at least one. 

Many ask for us to be ""brutal"", but in Europe you would be the biggest person someone might ever have seen.
Another thing is also the fact that we ""brutal"" people are normally the ones that are wrong. When someone tells a girl that weighs over 200 lbs that she needs to loose a ""few"" pounds. In the rest of the world she crossed that ""few"" line at 160 lbs. 

We just had a mod-post concerning us downvoting sexy people and telling them to go to AmISexy. If we can do that to good looking people my personal opinion is that we should do it to overweight people too. But to r/loseit.

http://i.imgur.com/rDDav1x.jpg?1

I had just moved from a place where I was in a bad situation, viciously bullied, bad family life, and very little friends. I delt with that for 4 years.

I moved across the world to a whole new country,  involved person thanks to a good family life and close friends. 

Fast forward 3 years and in that time period I started really focusing on pulling myself together. I worked out, went 100% on hygiene, and really turned a lot around in terms of my looks. 

Socially, helped found one, went to parties, met loads of people, went to dances, dated girls, got out much more

Here's a barrage of pictures including me and my many hairstyles:

Now that I'm in high school, ""she would be pretty if she didn't have acne,"" and usually a girl prettier than I am is chosen over me. A girl without acne. Even my mother on occasion will comment on ""how terrible"" my face has been looking lately. It has gotten much better as I am now on a prescription, but it is not perfect and I have many scars. I would looove to go on birth control for it as I have heard many success stories with acne being cleared by birth control, but I am highly prone to blood clots so this is out of the question. I wash my face three times almost everyday so I'd like to think the acne is not a hygiene problem, but one can never tell.

Basically I am putting my pictures up for all you Redditors to see because I am going to college next year, or really anything else that I can do to improve my appearance. Thank you all!

I've been lifting weights a little bit -- in the last month I've increased my squat by 60 pounds -- but I'm unsure of my goals. Should I pig out? Do I need to lose weight? I think my posture is bad too. Also, etc etc etc.

Wow! I woke up this morning to a bunch o' comments.

Thank you everyone for the advice.

I'm going to style my hair after I play a small part in an indie flick. I have to keep the long hair as I'm playing a gypsy. I'd like to cut it an maybe get a bob. I'm not a brunette anymore

Sunken eyes

I'm not Indian

As for the weight. I'm going to lose it. I'm sick of being a fat fuck. If I lose maybe another 12 I'll be voluptuous.
Right now I'm sitting at 96kg. 

My friend who picked on my nose has her own insecurites. She's heading off to Malaysia next year to get a boob job. I think she wanted someone to tag along with
