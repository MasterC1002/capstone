1355432398.0,14sz2i,A Thought Before Seeing The Hobbit tonight.,Opheiliac,640,91,148,"On December tenth


It doesn't seem that long ago.  I remember skipping a day of school to be the first in line for tickets, and settling in with my popcorn, hands shaking and my heart in my throat.


Now, sitting in that same seat with the overhead lights dimming, the huge film screen flickering.


Now at the beginning of another Middle-Earth film trilogy


I'll be driving my own car to the cinema this year


I've moved twice, started a book, played onstage in Vancouver, found love, made friends (and lost some),have done lots, done nothing, wrote


I've grown, I'm reminded what moved me so much about this story the first time around.  


Within these epic, following through and the importance of peace (whatever one's peace may be).  That the good things in life are worth preserving, worth protecting,  down to the smallest, seemingly mundane things (a box of salt, a strand of hair, the memory of strawberries).


I forget sometimes in my plans and pursuits, or what to take at post-secondary, that it can be easy to overlook the simple and beautiful things and people around me, that are worth cherishing.


I'm reminded again that greatness isn't always money, standing by a friend, or shouldering a burden you weren't asked to.   Greatness can be a home, a place to sit and eat (however many meals a day one finds agreeable) and be at peace.


So tonight, with the excitement of a child, and an appreciation for the ideas values and imagination an excellent and moving story has brought to my life over eleven years. I will visit The Shire once more, and hold my breath as the opening credits run across the screen. 


And After that? My life will go on much as it has for the past decade, trials and anomalies.  And myself and my world will continue to grow and change.  But if I take anything from this, it will be that when I go home, to find someplace quiet, where I can sit down with a glass of wine , with a good friend, laugh, the best part is often coming home

**Gandalf's Speech to Frodo**

*Movie:* http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izSjEQ84OwQ

*Book:*
&gt;""I wish it need not have happened in my time
&gt;""So do I, but that is not for them to decide. All we have to decide is what to do with the time that is given to us."" (Tolkien, 50) 


**Sam's Speech**

*Movie:* http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JEMdXhfO-Wk

*Book:* 
&gt;""Yes, Mr. Frodo: adventures, as I used to call them. I used to think they were things the wonderful folk in the stories went out and looked for, because they wanted them, because they were exciting and life was a bit dull, a kind of sport, as you might say. But that's not the way of it in the tales that really mattered, usually - their paths were laid that way, only they didn't."" (Tolkien


**White Shores**

*Movie:* http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-3U52TcWmE

Drogo and Primula died from drowning on the Brandywine river in Buckland. Witnesses claim to have seen a struggle. This is Smeagle's MO. 

 Gollum only had two clues; ""Shire and Baggins"", this would have been Drogo. He wouldn't know the difference between Drogo and Bilbo, as he never actually saw Bilbo, and didn't know his first name.

What do you guys think? I couldnt find this theory anywhere. 

•edit for clarity

*Edit 2

Some good points (and some not so good points) have been brought up, add some extra elements to the story, and next time you read it imagine that this is what happened. You will be surprised with how much it changes.There are many things in LOTR that is up to speculation (Tom B for example), this is one of those things. Reading through it it adds a lot to Frodo and Gandalfs character. And all I ask is that you keep it in mind when reading it again.

Remember

**Gandalf said Gollum turned back before finding the shire**

Yes, the ring would have him, as completely as it had Gollum. This also brings up that the elves would know what happened, and the enemy as well. The elves wouldn't tell him because Gandalf didn't, and the enemy didn't because he never had the chance.

**Gollum was with Shelob in 2980**

This is the most convincing argument against my theory, that date was gathered by the elves during their interrogation with Gollum, who certainly wouldn't know what year it was.

**SnakeyesX lied about there being a struggle**
&gt;'... and he went out boating on the Brandywine River; and he and his wife were drownded, and he pulled her in after him.' said Sandyman, the Hobbiton miller. 'You shouldn't listen to all you hear, Sandyman.' said the gaffer, who did not much like the miller. 'There isn't no call to go talking of pushing and pulling. Boats are quite tricky enough for those that sit still without looking further for the cause of trouble.'

If you saw a couple get drownded, and not accustomed to thinking about foul play, it would look exactly as described. Gaffer shot it down because he shot down ANYTHING which put Bagginses in a bad light.

**Gollum didn't find the ring

Gandalf said that Gollum turned back from his quest of retrieving the ring before he got to the Brandywine. All I'm saying is that he didn't turn back until after he got his revenge on Baggins.

**Edit 3: Gandalf wouldn't lie!**

Yes, nor Sam, *ever* learning the truth (Otherwise they would revise the red book). But I insist that Gandalf would have lied to prevent sowing hatred in Frodos heart, and therefore giving the ring more power over him. Remember, Frodo wrote LOTR and therefor any lies Gandalf told would be kept intact.

**Edit 4: Why stop there

This is actually why I came up with this theory in the first place. He had a mission to kill Bilbo and never went through with it. That seemed odd. Frodo thought it was odd too and asked Gandalf about it, I am sure. No, something else drew him away. So my friends think, those that hunted him for me."" What I think is more likely, he went all the way to the Shire, killed Drogo (thinking he was Bilbo), and then, went to Mordor. Having had his personal revenge he then saught the true lord of the ring. This explanation

**Edit 5: Kyzf42 makes a more compelling argument than I can, if you know his true name ;-)**

(All quotes from *The Letters of JRR Tolkien.*)

&gt;Do you think Tom Bombadil, as I suspect, fully enshrined in the enclosed verses?

(16 December 1937)

&gt;As a story, for instance, rather stuck at the *Council of Elrond*. And even in a mythical Age there must be some enigmas, as there always are. Tom Bombadil is one (intentionally) ...


&gt;Tom Bombadil is not an important person - to the narrative. I suppose he has some importance as a 'comment'. I mean, though I would not be prepared to analyze the feeling precisely. I would not, however, have left him in, if he did not have some kind of function. I might put it this way. The story is cast in terms of a good side, and a bad side, beauty against ruthless ugliness, moderated freedom with consent against compulsion that has long lost any object save mere power, as it were taken 'a vow of poverty', observing and to some extent knowing

&gt;He has no connexion in my mind with the Entwives. What had happened to them is not resolved in this book. He is in a way the answer to them in the sense that he is almost the opposite

(25 April 1954)

&gt;You may be able to conceive of your unique relation to the Creator without a name - can you: for in such a relation pronouns become proper nouns? But as soon as you are in a world of other finites with a similar, who are you? Frodo asked not 'what is Tom Bombadil' but 'Who is he'. We and he no doubt often laxly confuse the questions. Goldberry gives what I think is the correct answer. We need not go into the sublimities of 'I am that am' - which is quite different from *he is* * . She adds as a concession a statement of part of the 'what'. He is *master* in a peculiar way: he has no fear, and no desire of possession or domination at all. He merely knows and understands about such things as concern him in his natural little realm. He hardly even judges, and as far as can be seen makes no effort to reform or remove even the Willow.

&gt;I don't think Tom needs philosophizing about, because he represents certain things otherwise left out. I do not mean him to be an allegory - or I should not have given him so particular, individual, and ridiculous a name - but 'allegory' is the only mode of exhibiting certain functions: he is then an 'allegory', or an exemplar, a particular embodying of pure (real) natural science: the spirit that desires knowledge of other things, their history and nature, a spirit coeval with the rational mind, of the World (Universe), distorted on the circumference


&gt;* Only the *first* person (of worlds or anything) can be unique. If you say *he is* there must be more than one

(Sept. 1954)

Also

&gt;There is no 'embodiment' of the Creator anywhere in this story or mythology.

All save one. There waiting, unmoving, steadfast as a graven image in Rath Dinen.

'You cannot enter here

The Black Rider flung back his hood

'Old fool!' he said. 'Old fool! This is my hour. Do you not know Death when you see it? Die now and curse in vain!' And with that he lifted high his sword and flames ran down the blade.

Gandalf did not move. And in that ver moment, recking nothing of wizardry or war, welcoming only the morning that in the sky far above the shadows of death was coming with the dawn.
And as if in answer there came from far away another note. Horns

I also love how passages like this subtly reveal the ""other-worldliness"" of Elves, is a clear example of the Elves' ability to perceive things more deeply and in a different ""dimension"", if you will, than other Children of Illúvitar. He sees the power of Aragorn's bloodline, majesty, and leadership manifested as an orb-like crown.

3) When Eowyn develops feelings for Aragorn during the trek to Helm's Deep: ""Pssh! He's taken by that dream lady! *Arwen appears in a flashback* Yeah that elf lady!""
4) ""So how many rings are there?"" I explained the Ring Wraiths, and then the one ring. To which she replied: ""So he wants that one ring to become the...Lord of the Rings? I get it now!""
5) After Theoden says ""Let them come!"": ""Just go up to them [the orcs] and say 'Go home!'""

1365859054.0,1c9mjx,"The more you know, the better it gets.",myeyesareknackered,94,12,http://www.reddit.com/r/lotr/comments/1c9mjx/the_more_you_know_the_better_it_gets/, my first experience with his writings struck me the same as I have heard other people express it: they opened my imagination like nothing else.

So as much as I enjoyed the books the first time around, Gandalf is an intriguing Walt Disney-type of magical character and he has lots of groovy cool adventures, but as I learned that he was actually a god and was sent on a mission by the Creator, it was like a re-discovery of the character.  

I saw the LOTR movies ten years ago but I didn’t realize Gandalf’s sword was King Turgon’s sword.  Now, but which an elf could still kill—awesome!) at the fountain during the fall of Gondolin.  

I could go on with hundreds of “aha!” moments I’ve had as I have learned the history of Arda, it separates out his work, profoundly, from all the sword-and-sorcery stuff that came in Tolkien’s wake.
