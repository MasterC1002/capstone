Take a look at [fork etiquette](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eating_utensil_etiquette#Fork_etiquette)

&gt;The European style, it is conducted straight to the mouth by the left hand. The tines remain pointing down.

And the American style:

&gt;In the American style, a single bite-sized piece is cut with the knife. The knife is then set down on the plate, the fork transferred from the left hand to the right hand, and the food is brought to the mouth for consumption. The fork is then transferred back to the left hand and the knife is picked up with the right.[3][7] In contrast to the European hidden handle grip, in the American style the fork is held much like a spoon or pen once it is transferred to the right hand to convey food to the mouth.

Now, using the European style of utensil-handling, as expected.  Then the camera switches to Hans Landa, SS officer, ""Jew Hunter,"" 100% pure German, and there he is with the fork pointed up in his right hand

My first thought was that this was an accident, even the finger placement to make a ""three"" was a major plot point.  And yet here's the primary German character eating like an American.  Must have been an oversight.

*However*, is Austrian-German.  I don't know how universal this European fork etiquette is, but it seems safe to guess that if Christoph Waltz is out of character and eating a strudel, he's got his fork firmly planted in his left hand.

So why the American style fork etiquette for Hans Landa?  My only other idea, when he's talking about why he's so good at hunting Jews.  He talks about his ability to ""think like a Jew,"" and ""get inside their head.""  Maybe here he's trying to find the Basterds now, and to do that he needs to think like an American, which for him means doing everything possible in the American fashion?  I don't know.  Just speculation.

Also nobody notices before that there is a hole in the front of the bank where a bus just crashed in? Not even one customer came to go into the building or something?

When Sarek visits Kirk at his home, because: a) Nobody knew at that point that Spock's body still existed, and b) as the high priestess said at the end of the movie, the re-fusion ritual ""has not been done since times past, and even then only in legend"". So I don't know exactly what Sarek planned. Perhaps the Vulcans have some sort of storage location where *katras* can be deposited, allowing the living to ""commune"" with the dead. But whatever his plans were, he clearly did not intend Kirk to go to Genesis.

So if the characters had behaved according to what they knew at the time, and the young, resurrected Spock would have died on Genesis as it tore itself apart.

But that's not what happened. Kirk, at which point (after the nastiness with Kruge and the destruction of the *Enterprise*), they took him back to Vulcan and re-joined him with his *katra*. But none of that should have happened, because none of them had any reason to go to Genesis in the first place.",,False,self,False,t3_1h6t72

While the show was very well done, how is it, that when the daughter dies, the weeks following NO one attempts to locate her (officials). A truant officer had come to the house before, saying that since she was missing school she would have to go to juvenile court if she wasn't back TOMORROW. weeks passed and nobody looked. And when the fumigator, or bug killer guy was killed in the crawlspace? his employer didn't think to check maybe at the LAST place he was? and the dad never thought it suspicious that the guy never came back to say that the job was done? and WHY could the ghosts kill people? that ruined the story! if the ghosts could cause physical harm to the living, why didn't they simply just kill everyone? i understand that some of them kept them there because they wanted the baby from the mom. But i mean there was a psychotic mass murderer living in the basement, yet only the agenda of a select few out of the MANY are actually enacted! and if the dead can also communicate, and try to conniving ploys to get people to make it so (the armenian guy). Also WHAT was the deal with the psychic lady? she came in like 3 episodes, not only that but the spirit mocks her for trying stating it is an archaic play

I feel like the show would have been perfect, she realizes that she is a terrible mother and perhaps, having a baby wasn't ACTUALLY what she needed. at this point she had her spiritual awakening, and then should have disappeared forever, moving on to the next world/ heaven/ afterlife what have you. same with Tate, who finally learned to love another person, and the root of his anger, finally had her body found, but for some reason they convoluted it

2) This is one of my all time favorite plot holes.

Naaah, nothing suspicious about five male adults who all appear to be shaken or nervous buying this stuff in presumabaly the middle of the night. Nothing to see here.

3) Boyd claims that bc he ""called the stripper personally"" that means no one knows she's there. Huh?? How does he come to that conclusion?? I'm no stripper expert but it seems logical that she would tell a girlfriend or fellow stripper that she's going to a vegas hotel room. But even if she didn't

4) The aformentioned electric saws? They definitely don't look like the type of electric saw it would take to dismember a human being. They looked more like something you would use to carve a turkey!

5) The guys were making so much noise that security was called. However, that didn't seem to annoy anyone.

So the first part of the film is the trailer that most people saw. Enterprise and crew are all on the planet Nibiru. Trying to save the planet from some form of volcano that is threatening the planet. Spock gets stuck in the volcano and the Enterprise could rescue him but would need to expose itself to native civilization to do so. Spock says, just leave me. Naturally Kirk and Co blow it off and rescue Spock.  

Now at this point, but no, turns out, they were on a survey mission. So wtf, did Spock just decide half way through the mission that he believes in the Prime Directive so much that he will give his life for it? I doubt he was reluctantly participating in the mission since he was the one who setup and delivered the cold fusion device to stop the volcanic activity?

While we're on that, the amount of energy would be massive, so it probably destroy the planet anyway, so its not freezing the stuff, its not fusing it. What does it do?

The alien who watches the Enterprise takes off then proceeds to draw a PERFECT plan drawing of the Enterprise despite only seeing it for about 30 seconds from a handful of drawings. Ok fine

So then the main part of the film actually starts. Kirk gets removed from command of the Enterprise and is due to be sent back to the academy. From Captain to Cadet in 10 seconds, Starfleet, which by the way has been militarized since the last film as demonstrated by their new [Nazi-esque style uniforms] (http://scifanatic.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/stid-img-34.jpg) similar to the job that [ starship troopers uniforms](http://www.cinemaview.sk/fotogaleria/Hviezdna_pechota/obr4.jpg) did as a plot device used to communicate how serious their military is. The bombing results in a super secret meeting of Starfleets top brass, all the captains of the local ships etc, you know, the head of the snake... which would be a very tempting target... Now it seems that Kirk (who by the way, has managed to go from being a Cadet to Commander and first officer of the Enterprise in the time it took him to leave his debriefing and fall into the nearest bar and have a quick shot) is the only one with half a brain here, but I mean, view able from anywhere in the city really, he manages to beat his previous record of Cadet to Captain. So wtf is the story with Starfleet


So the bomber fucks off to ~~Pakistan~~ Kronos to hide in an isolated part of some province. Admiral says he's worried about sending a starship to Kronos because it could potentially start a war, the Klingons wont mind that. Kirk agrees. Spock freaks out on several points, not least of which is that they are executing someone without trial, Kirk disagrees with him. Meanwhile Scotty is freaking out that there are 72 ~~cruise missiles~~ advanced photon torpedoes which he has no idea whats in them and how they could potentially affect the warp core... or something, resigns his commission and fucks off to the nearest bar with his monkey sidekick. Fine. On the way to Kronos, Kirk decides he's been following orders for too long and decides to alter the plan, he's going to sit the Enterprise in the Neutral zone (a violation of the Klingon Federation peace treaty/truce)
and send a strike team to catch the bomber in a ~~blackhawk~~ shuttle. They get there, he implies all is not right with the 72 missiles (as if we haven't already figured that out ourselves). They crack open one of the missles and they discover its got a person in it in cryo-stasis. They can't take them out though because technobabble....without knowing the exact frequency. Cool. Turns out, the bomber is Khan, (there are more obvious signs that he is Khan but they aren't relevant to the plot holes) and the people in the torpedoes are his crew. Turns out the Admiral wanted to kill Khan and his crew at the same time as starting a war with the Klingons. But why did he go out of his way to setup one of the most elaborate ways of accomplishing those 3 tasks all in the same move. Its so completely unnecessary, why could he not kill the crew separately, they were already in his control, why bother loading them up in as a bomb if not to make some poetic ending for Khan. Why would he bother to go to all that bother...

A few others that I wont go into more detail because I've already put in a wall of text already...

* Chekhov seems to forget how to transport people who are moving targets like he did in [this scene](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGNfrNJZin4) in the previous film.

* Kirk survives long enough from direct exposure to a matter antimatter reaction to slowly die of a radiation poisoning.

* Spock has more emotions than Data in Star Trek Generations

* How did Scotty manage to remain undetected despite the at least half dozen ships that were in the convoy he snuck into

* How did they avoid a war with the Klingons despite the fact that there was an attack on one of their patrols that left most if not all dead

* How did they suddenly realise they could detach the bodies in the torpedoes successfully without killing them?

* Why did Old Spock say ""I told you I wouldn't tell you anything from the future

Some of these might be more really poor writing

How did Simon (James McAvoy) make it to the hospital? After being attacked by Franck he leaves an auction house somewhere in Central London, corpse and painting in a parking garage somewhere in the East End of London.

So, Comstock (henceforth: ""bad you"") is killed by Dewitt (henceforth: ""good you"") but that's not good enough, so ""good you"" decides that the only solution is to go back in time to your baptism and kill yourself before it happens (or doesn't happen) so that ""bad you"" can never exist.  Which is exactly what happens.... but it makes literally no sense.

It's already been established in the game that when you travel to a place/time when you already exist, ""good you, ""dead you"" (Dewitt the Vox martyr), and ""bad you""... and ""good you"" specifically says he is confused because he suddenly has the memories of ""dead you"" as well.  If that's so, why doesn't he also have the memories of ""bad you?""

But that's not the plot hole I'm getting to, ""past you"" should, by the logic above, still be alive and kicking, headed to his baptism, ready to create ""bad you.""  ""Good you"" died for nothing because ""past you"" is still alive and nothing has been done to prevent ""bad you"" at all.  

TL;DR:  you go back in time and kill the you that went back in time, because if you did, you would have 'merged' with the antagonist at the beginning of the game, or (and?) the dead you in the middle.

HOW then does he manage to travel back to the 'fetus' version of himself at the end and choke himself? Was he having a tiny fetus blackout? or can he just travel back to any point in his life and in which case why did he limit himself only to his blackouts?
