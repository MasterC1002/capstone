Excellent. I endeavor to know myself better

It might be worth noting that the 55 things (flagged with annoying bolded numbers I'll remove, and it's quite clearly impossible to be both.

If you learn 55 things from this

&gt; If you're curious about the new dude in your life but know better than to grill him with 20 questions

Oh

&gt; You don't have to date a guy for six months to get the lowdown on who he really is. With the right clues

Men are so simple like that. 

&gt; ""A man's actions ‚Äî especially the ones you see in unguarded moments when he's not going out of his way to try to impress you (or doesn't realize you're watching) 

We're not at item 1 and we've already played the voyeuristic stalker card. Good job!

&gt; ‚Äî can speak volumes about his character and personality traits, a psychotherapist who specializes in couple's issues. 

It wasn't my idea

Would now be a good time to mention that some people become shrinks to figure out why *they* are broken? 

&gt; To help you decode a guy you've just started seeing

I want you to remember that phrase. A TEAM OF EXPERTS.

&gt; **His Favorite Sport**

Feverish masturbation. 

Actually, as opposed to ""player of mainstream sports"". But it seems to be more a grammatical failing than an implication that a marathon runner and an armchair quarterback are physical equals. 

&gt; As for the guy who's just not into sports at all

Of course, so presumably a person who's not into sports at all is one who gets no exercise, but I don't think of lazy people as independent thinkers. Or, the entire section was meant to be *fans* of sports, and the writer just twisted the words of the expert badly. Speaking of, our sporting expert was...

&gt; relationship-skills coach Steve Nakamoto

Rather than blaming my vile personality and corpse-like visage for my bachelorhood, several of the older women in my life repeatedly said I would never remain single because ""Some girl will get her hooks into you!"" I suffered some small trauma from that statement. This guy's not helping.

&gt; **How Long He's Been Hanging with His Friends**

Er... depends on the friend

With the vagueness of these so far maybe one man *can* embody all 55 traits without contradiction.

&gt; A guy who has been friends with the same posse since he was 10 years old can certainly claim loyalty as one of his strong suits. But ""you better like what you see, author of *Smart Man Hunting*. ""And be patient, because it will take a while for you to win his trust."" 

I find placing food nearby and holding still helps earn the trust of the wild dudebro. 

&gt; If your date has buddies from all areas of his life ‚Äî i.e., work ‚Äî don't be afraid to drag him to your cousin's wedding. 

Wait

&gt; ""He has no problem schmoozing strangers and adapts to new situations easily.""

Okay

&gt; **Credit vs. Cash**

Card 1 or card 2? I'm torn. Actually

&gt; A guy who likes to flash his plastic craves status. ""He may be ambitious and confident. He'll reach his financial goals, a licensed clinical psychologist and registered financial consultant. 

A guy who flashes credit cards a lot to his date has either already reached his goals or will *never attain them*.

Hold up... ""licensed clinical psychologist and registered financial consultant""? *Really?* 

&gt; ""If he always pays in cash

Or he doesn't want to be tracked

&gt; And if his wallet is dry? Here's a guy who's dependent on others to take care of him.

Or you know

&gt; **His Bad Habits**

I told you

&gt; Gambling men are risk-takers

Because sitting next to your date for three hours watching him pull a lever and bum twenties is *great* fun. Been there

&gt; ""But their over-the-top optimism that they'll come out ahead makes it difficult for them to face reality, assistant professor of psychiatry at Vanderbilt University, in Nashville. 

Really? I wasn't aware that a gambling addiction led to a detachment from reality. Thank you

&gt; ""Hard-core smokers tend to be anxious

No worries

&gt; And if he's a boozer

So

None of these are habits

I thought we stopped calling addictions ""bad habits"" (and thus sins of similar intensity to nose-picking) when I was about twelve.

&gt; **His Communication Style**

Grunts.

&gt; When your date opts to email you ‚Äî rather than call ‚Äî he could be a hard nut to crack. ""The fact that he chooses a communication method that allows him to edit what he says signals that he might not want to show his true self, professor of psychology at San Diego State University. 

Before telephones everyone was a hard nut to crack

&gt; An IM addict 

You can edit IMs before you send them too

&gt; craves your nonstop attention and needs that instant assurance that you're there for him. 

Do you do understand what ""asynchronous communication"" is? IMs are less instant than a telephone call

30 IMs in as many minutes? Yes

&gt; And the phone fan? He might be a little old-fashioned and likes to do things by the book. But

Great

&gt; **The Clothes You Wear That Turn Him On**

Something with Velcro down the front for easy tearing-open.

&gt; If your fave T-shirt and jeans or a cute little sundress do more for him than your slinky black number, low-maintenance chicks. 

Maybe he likes the color.

&gt; A man who's wowed by a woman who likes to get dolled up in high-end designer duds places a high priority on prestige. 

What about a man who's wowed by a woman who likes to get dolled up in duds that aren't insanely expensive? Is there a space in this world for the man who doesn't need to know who you're wearing?

&gt; And a guy who wants a Carmen Electra-sexy girl on his arm is looking for an ego boost. ""He places a lot of value on being admired and envied.""

I wasn't aware that ""a Carmen Electra-sexy girl"" was a form of clothing. Did someone shoot Carmen and turn her into a stole? 

&gt; **How He Likes to Party**

Party like 'sexy' party or party like 'social' party? Because it's completely naked either way.

&gt; He might be gorgeous, 

Okay

Also, damaged, introverted heart arranges for weekly ""nights out with the boys"". Call it a party? Hell no.

Oh

&gt; **How He Deals with Traffic**

Once again

&gt; If he constantly weaves in and out of cars, 

He's a fucking douche. 

&gt; ""it's pretty clear that he has a problem with aggression, professor of psychology at the University of Hawaii and author of *Road Rage and Aggressive Driving*. 

Why are we consulting a doctor focusing on *road rage* for relationship advice? 

&gt; If he's able to exude Zenlike calm when stuck in gridlock

Oh

Shame those hands-free laws weren't one year sooner.

&gt; **If He Always Initiates Sex**

After ""feverish masturbation"" three times

&gt; Does your guy jump your bones whenever,"" according to sexologist Sandor Gardos, MD. 

His names are almost anagrams

&gt; Surprisingly, 

Wait

&gt; ""he's likely to be an eager-to-please person or still healing a damaged ego from some serious rejection in his past.""

Or maybe he's not a rapist!

&gt; **What Time He Prefers to Have Sex**

When I'm erect. Works better.

&gt; You're dating a spontaneous go-getter if he's bent on a.m. booty. 

""Bent on""? As in ""determined

But sometimes it's just that getting older means it doesn't get up as often and not using the morning wood seems... a bit ungrateful.

&gt; While his high energy makes him a blast

It's worse when he IMs you at a party while he fucks you in the morning.

&gt; If he only wants nighttime nooky, PhD, author of Electrify Your Sex Life. Don't expect the Kama Sutra, but prepare for long, sensual sack sessions.

Have you *read* the Kama Sutra? Some of that shit takes a long time to set up! And is as useful as Cosmo's sex advice.

(TIL that men only have sex at one time in the day without ever changing.)

&gt; **What He Orders in a Restaurant**

More relevant is how he treats the wait staff. But... meh

&gt; A meat-and-potatoes-type guy is usually steady and dependable

An *image coach*? I... Brain. Hurt.

&gt; ""But he's also a little unadventurous."" If your date goes for exotic dishes

I'm surprised an image coach didn't come up with the obvious ""if he orders an exotic dish he's showing off for his date"". 

Also: Salad is neither meat-and-potatoes nor exotic. Once again

&gt; **Neat Freak or Messy Man**

I'm more of a clutter bunny.

&gt; A guy who puts his dirty socks in the hamper is one thing; a guy who color-codes them in his drawer is something else. 

Yes

&gt; ""This man is way too fastidious to have fun

So

&gt; A mildly messy man is looser and more open-minded. But if the inside of his shower has never seen a scrub brush

Well

&gt; How do I know all of this? Because many of my gay friends have sexual trysts with married men on a regular basis! 

So

&gt; While there is a small number of men who are completely straight acting and could fool anyone with the most advanced gaydar system

I live down the street from a swinger's club. Boy

&gt; Girls

I personally am grateful there's billions of people

&gt; If you think you‚Äôre found a sensitive

I don't know what's more offensive

&gt; No man is THAT considerate. If you‚Äôre married to a man and his behavior has all the earmarks of an affair

I wonder if he knows my best Negro friend? 

&gt; sleeps with a seemingly enormous number of married men each month

Okay

&gt; he‚Äôs helped me to compile some tips. The top 20 reasons your man may be gay. Now

So I've sat through 5 paragraphs of offensive personal fantasy for no reason. Gee

&gt; but there are serious signs mixed in also. 

I love it when things do that. Just last week I was bandaging up a sucking chest wound and the emergency instructions said ""Step 5: Stick your finger in and see if the lungs feel squishy."" Boy

So was that one of the tongs-in-cheek ones? It certainly would be if the author recognized the existence of bisexuals

&gt; - He listens to showtunes, Judy Garland, and Barbra Streisand.

And it was a homosexual male who helped you compile this list? Your real gay friend

&gt; - His profession is one of the following: visual merchandiser, event planner, ballet dancer, piano bar singer, beautician, CEO of a major fashion or cosmetics label, or works at Bloomingdale‚Äôs

Yeah, I guess the entire Faktorowicz family was living in denial. (You know the patriarch better as ""Max Factor"". His sons and later grandsons were all part of the family business.) Oh, and Ronald Perelman (no, not Hellboy), who's had more wives than Six Flags has swing. 

...

SEE HOW STUPID IT SOUNDS?

Though now that I think about it

&gt; - Doesn‚Äôt know what the difference is between a tight end and a fullback

I know this one! It's directorial shorthand in gay porn

&gt; - You‚Äôre out in the park playing baseball and all he wants to do is to be in the outfield.

That doesn't even make sense. It's like Guest is mashing her face in her magic keyboard with the special ""Sports Metaphor"" hotkey.

&gt; - He says he‚Äôs ‚Äòmetrosexual‚Äô but he‚Äôs had more manicures and pedicures in the last month than you‚Äôve had in the last year.
&gt; - You go shopping and he knows more about designer handbags than you do.
&gt; - He owns more designer handbags than you do.

That's less homosexual and more ""needlessly expensive transvestite"".

&gt; - You go to the video store and he suggests a chick flick.
&gt; - You look over during the mushy part of the chick flick and he asks you for a tissue.
&gt; - He owns plaid Ralph Lauren shorts that he likes to wear with a pink polo with the collar up and penny loafers without socks. And he‚Äôs put the pennies in.
&gt; - You come home from work and he‚Äôs redecorated in a pink motif.

PINK! I SO FUCKING CALLED IT!

Sorry

If you want your eyes to bleed a bit more

&gt; - You go to a bar and he orders a cosmopolitan.
&gt; - He punctuates every sentence with
&gt; - You go shopping and he knows the difference between 400 and 600 count Egyptian and Suprema cotton.
&gt; - He wears male cosmetics.
&gt; - You open his medicine cabinet and he‚Äôs got more skin and hair products than you do.
&gt; - His favorite talk shows are Oprah and Ellen.
&gt; - He has a collection of John Waters DVD‚Äôs.
&gt; - You go to Starbucks and he orders a tall, no foam, soy, sugar-free vanilla latte.

**The A-Z of kinky (Abridged)** 

&gt;I (i.e. you): are you turned by you? There are lot of fetishes that involve self-love and some of the more random include autovampirism (imagining yourself as a vampire) or autozoophilia (imagining yourself as an animal or plush toy). Learning to love yourself (even if it's as a vamp) is never a bad thing

God damn did that get a little out there fast. Leaping straight towards furry territory pretty fast there cosmo. 

&gt;Objectophilia: Is your BF hot for his car? Some peeps can get turned on by objects (and we‚Äôre not talking vibrators). Anything from sofas to the fridge can be a hot spot for certain dudes

He said he liked the new couch - LET'S HAVE SEX ON IT. Sigh Cosmo

&gt; TENS unit: This is a medical-device-gone-kinky - it sends out electric currents. Its ability to create steady but adjustable (!) tingling sensations means it‚Äôs favoured by some fetishist for the not-so-medical aim of getting off.

This shit is actually pretty fucking important to get right. Side effects include death, place the electrodes on certain areas (pacemakers, necks, inside you) or you don't know what you're doing. It's some pretty serious BDSM shit. Don't for the love of god just tell some poor girl to by devices to electrocute herself or her partner without mentioning that people need to do their fucking research. 

&gt; YOLO: You only live once

The people writing this have degrees. 

&gt;Zoophilia: Do you find the idea of pretending to be a cat, which means you like to role play as an animal. This is different from bestiality, where the person actually wants to have sex with animals, and that‚Äôs just gross!

Yeah cosmo... That's not zoophilia. Wanting to role play as an animal is one thing
&gt; Umm... Zoophilia actually IS sex with animals... you may want to change that - ""zoo"" meaning animals, or at least a desire for sex with animals. Whilst zoophilia and bestiality are considered synonymous terms, it has been argued that zoophilia is the DESIRE for sex with animals and bestiality is the ACT of having sex with animals. At best, you could make this about talking about people who have a fetish for animal skin or fur but it's pushing the boundaries of the word. What you have defined as zoophilia is actually just called animal-play, puppy-play, pony-play etc but is widely considered either a component of role-play or part of the 'Furry' fetish. Regardless Zoophilia is a synonym for bestiality, you have just given it an incorrect definition

Okay

&gt; ""Most men want to appear strong and in control,"" says Henry Cloud, PhD, author of *How to Get a Date Worth Keeping*.

One thing is definitely true: Henry Cloud did write that book.

&gt; **2. He takes fights to the finish.**

Well

&gt; **3. He guards his guy habits.**

Like peeing standing up?

&gt; Men are fiercely protective of their buddy time.

""Having friends"" is neither a ""guy"" thing

Who the fuck are you? No PhD

&gt; **4. He stops talking as much.**

Well thank God. 

&gt; So when you start dating a dude who's willing to talk to you for hours on end, until you're an actual couple and he adopts a monosyllabic conversation MO.

I've known people who never get to that ""shut up"" phase. Yes

&gt; **5. He wants less sex.**

Cosmo normally devotes pages to averting this cardinal sin. 

&gt; That's what Lucy, Peter and I had tons of amazing sex,"" she recalls. 

Nice choice of a fake name there. Claaaaassy.

&gt; ""So after a while, when we got home late from a party and he didn't want to get it on, I called him on it. He looked at me like I was crazy, then explained that he was simply tired ‚Äî no big deal."" 

So, *obviously* he's secretly gay.

This should not be a revelation at age 28. 18

&gt; **6. Goat rape.**

Nah

&gt; **6. He shows his kinky side.**

&gt; As you and your guy get closer, 

Not the best choice of slang

&gt; So don't judge or reject him when he does bring up some new erotic ideas. Of course, and you will probably get what you want in bed as well. 

So. shoot him down and immediately use his guilt at having some shameful fetish to push him to indulge your own? 

&gt; Even if you don't turn him down

THEY USED THE C WORD!

Eugh

Not every night is the night of your 5th date, but more relaxed sex. There will be more ""alone time"". There will be more verbal shorthand and less need to provide biographical info. Occasionally your personalities will clash because you are not photocopies of each other. In essense, there comes a point where both of you stop being ""a stranger who's got a stranglehold on your hormones"" and start being *friends*.

**Wanted**: a restaurant with good food

But alas, D. and I finally found a restaurant with so-so food, dim lighting, and a table in the back‚Ä¶ unfortunately without a long tablecloth. 

It wasn't perfect

In preparation for the evening

After sitting down in a booth in the back, got myself in tip-top shape then walked back to the table, taking in the view. Yikes, **people would see.** Not necessarily my business. **But that funny business was happening.** 

I relayed this to D. 

""If there were no chance of being caught

**""You're finger blasting me in a crowded restaurant in Manhattan. I don't think we need the entire clientele watching to make this interesting.""**

But he had a point. The idea was that we could get caught at any moment. **That's supposed to make it extra-hot

We ordered drinks

*He let out a little squeal* and I immediately chastised him for making a scene. D. promised to keep a straight face and even used his left hand to pick up his drink while his right hand reached for my thigh. As soon as he got under my skirt and was touching my upper thigh

After I calmed myself down

He *jabbed* his hand in the general right direction

""Enough meetings on my mound

***I'm pretty sure the granny two tables away knew exactly what I was talking about. But she seemed to approve.*** 

D. contorted his hand and managed to get to the bullseye. And ladies, I just put on this **goofy** grin while trying to look really busy with other things. Nothing going on here. Just taking a sip of my wine. Why, no, my boyfriend's hand is not up my skirt, I'm simply eating a forkful of salad like one does at a restaurant. 

And then suddenly our lovely server was coming at us. 

""Stopstopstopstopserveriscomingserveriscomingserveriscoming

*""Well
D. slid his hand back to his own lap. I don't think the server noticed. 

This happened, and I became convinced‚Äîconspiracy theory style‚Äîthat the entire restaurant staff knew what was going on. I swore the busboy was smirking at us, I was sure the chef who came out to talk to the hostess only did so to get a look at my spread knees, and I would have put money on the fact that our server was texting the rest of the people in the kitchen, ""**U have to come see this!**"" 

We decided to wait till our main course was served to avoid being caught red-*handed* again. Once our dishes were on the table, plus he also covered so much more ground. 

***Unfortch***, he threw me down on the bed, lifted up my dress completely and went to town. I was so primed from all of that foreplay that I orgasmed in what might have been record time. I attribute it to him using his patented new move‚Äî*I‚Äôve been referring to it as the Knuckle Ball, but that feels utterly unsexy.* Any ideas for a better name?

Aesthetically, a left-up toilet seat is the **most offensive, irritating faux pas a man can possibly make.** Akin to being caught in the rain, pouring the crumby bits of your cereal into your bowl, hearing a knife scraping a plate...  Ok, you get the picture. 

First of all, it‚Äôs not something I want to touch, even with a toilet paper glove. Returning the seat to its natural position is just good manners. It‚Äôs totally reasonable to ask your man to be considerate and pop down the lid. Yes, you can argue why should he have to put it down but if (heaven forbid), he‚Äôs made the seat less than peachy clean, then he should DEFO be the one having to deal with it.

Plus

Don‚Äôt get me wrong, thus averting WWIII. This seems like a pretty fair deal. Perhaps this is something to suggest next time you get the rage when you see the throne with its lid up. And breeeathe. 


&gt;**Deputy Features Editor

Right. Ladies. It‚Äôs 2012. We‚Äôre facing the collapse of the global economy, endless pressures to be perfect and the prospect of The Voice being re-commissioned. Yet still ‚Äì still ‚Äì we care about whether a guy puts the loo seat down?

Admittedly

But the main argument against it seems to be, then lift it afterwards? As someone who has worked as a cleaner in university halls, I can confirm that w**hen men live alone, they basically just go everywhere, like a fire hose** ‚Äì so frankly, we should be grateful that they bother to lift the seat at all.

A quick straw poll round the office almost resorted into actual **fisticuffs*** breaking out on top of photocopier. Cosmo‚Äôs Web Editor, it‚Äôll probably extend to the rest of his life, and he‚Äôll be shown the door.** While our Features Director, Fiona, isn‚Äôt bothered either ‚Äì but admits to leaving all her kitchen cupboards open, which is basically the girl equivalent.

It‚Äôs clearly a contentious issue. But if your man is funny, thoughtful and sexy (and if not, why are you with him?), I really don‚Äôt see why a loo seat should be capable of causing so much kerfuffle. In fact, I‚Äôd probably let a man like that leave the kitchen cupboards open, too.

That‚Äôs why Cosmo uncovered time-tested methods used by the most successful animal trainers on the planet. Then we got top psychologists to show you how to apply those techniques to your guy. Read on and you will soon be able to teach him some new tricks.

**BOYFRIEND BUMMER 1: He‚Äôs Allergic to Chores**
Indulge His Playfulness

**As Used on Chimpanzees**
These primates are big mischief makers, you have a good shot at getting them to pay attention. ‚ÄúWhen we need the chimps to perform a task, we get on their level and play with them for 5 or 10 minutes,‚Äù says Eugene Cussons, rescue director on Animal Planet‚Äôs Escape to Chimp Eden. Once they‚Äôve had some fun, they‚Äôre more willing to heed commands because they instinctively know it‚Äôs their turn to return the favor.

**Apply It to Your Guy**
No matter how old they are, ‚Äúindulge him with a few minutes of acting goofy,‚Äù says Anthony Riche, PhD, author of Finally! How to Stop Dating Losers Forever. Then tell him you‚Äôll finish playing with him later, as long as he takes out the trash or does whatever else you need him to do. Since his mind and body are now surging with feel-good chemicals from your brief, fun exchange, says Riche. Use this technique consistently and

**BOYFRIEND BUMMER 2: He Lacks Social Graces**
Reward the Good

**As Used on Dogs**
Pretraining, trainers reward the dog when it behaves and ignore any actions they don‚Äôt like,‚Äù says Sutherland. Since dogs crave affection, they slowly begin to avoid bad habits and opt for good ones.

**Apply It to Your Guy**
Perhaps your man could use some finessing when it comes to social situations too ‚Äî say

‚ÄúMen don‚Äôt want to be treated like children,‚Äù says Patricia Covalt, PhD, author of What Smart Couples Know. Instead, ignore him when he‚Äôs being obnoxious, and give him some PDA (think a kiss or a tap on the butt) when he‚Äôs acting sweet. Since guys ‚Äî like dogs ‚Äî aim to please, he‚Äôll instinctively begin to avoid the behavior that makes you freeze him out. One caveat: Timing is crucial. Be sure to reward him at the exact moment he engages in a positive behavior; otherwise

**BOYFRIEND BUMMER 3: He Bolts When You Argue**
Keep a Cool Head

**As Used on Horses**
Beneath the powerful stallion exterior lies a skittish animal. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs why they generally respond well to a calming voice and touch from trainers, equine-behavior specialist in New Mexico.

**Apply It to Your Guy**
Like horses, collected manner (remember, as hard as it sounds, this is all going to benefit you in the end). For instance, if you are pissed that he hasn‚Äôt been planning enough date nights or can‚Äôt stand when he forgets to call while he‚Äôs out, your instinct might be to yell or get huffy. Instead, keep your composure by taking a few minutes alone before you approach him, even-toned voice. ‚ÄúCalmly telling him what he did wrong will make it easier for him to tune in to what you‚Äôre saying

**BOYFRIEND BUMMER 4: He Stands His Ground**
Use Proper Body Language

**As Used on Cougars**
When trainers want a cougar to bend to their will,‚Äù says Sutherland. They walk tall with squared-off shoulders. This stance ensures that the trainers don‚Äôt look like prey but they‚Äôre not threatening either.

**Apply It to Your Guy**
Even the most liberated guy can feel emasculated by a fearless chick. So when you‚Äôre having a sticky conversation with him,‚Äù says body-language expert Patti Wood, author of Success Signals. Similarly, if you stand meekly and tilt your head while talking to him, he might take it as a sign that you‚Äôre too submissive. ‚ÄúThe best way to stay on equal ground is to stand with good posture, your head up, and an open frame so he sees you as being on the same level as he is. This way,‚Äù says Wood.

**BOYFRIEND BUMMER 5: He Won‚Äôt Drag His Ass Off the Couch**
Approach Him at the Right Time

**As Used on Lions**
Lions are, they sleep for up to 20 hours a day and only move when they see it as beneficial to themselves. ‚ÄúTrying to get a lion to do something when it‚Äôs in resting mode can be very difficult and even dangerous,‚Äù says lion wrangler Dave Salmoni, host of Animal Planet‚Äôs After the Attack. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs why we make use of the animal‚Äôs active time instead of trying to force it into doing something it doesn‚Äôt want to when it‚Äôs chilling.‚Äù

**Apply It to Your Guy**
A man in veg-out mode is unlikely to move his rear no matter how much you try to engage him. ‚ÄúYou have to gauge when he‚Äôs in a productive mood and then pounce to get him to do what you want, bribe him. ‚ÄúMotivate him by making it worth his while,‚Äù says Riche. When you feel like you haven‚Äôt been able to have a heart-to-heart but he‚Äôs in a coma in front of the TV, try plying him with his favorite snack. If his cravings for the food outweigh his interest in the TV, he‚Äôll eventually cave.

**BOYFRIEND BUMMER 6: He‚Äôs Not Romantic**
Take Baby Steps

**As Used on Elephants**
These mammals can learn a variety of tasks but only on an incremental time line. ‚ÄúA trainer would never expect an animal to learn something without teaching it how to do it, they‚Äôll first show the animal how to curl its trunk around the brush. Next, they‚Äôll have it dip the brush into the paint. Only then would they show it how to create brush strokes. Animal trainers call this process of using small steps toward learning a new behavior successive approximations.

**Apply It to Your Guy**
The average guy is plenty romantic, like candles and a sultry soundtrack. Have your favorite chilled wine on hand so you can ask him to open it before dinner. This creates a ritual in his mind. Eventually, not only will he get a sense of what your romantic needs are, but he‚Äôll also start making a game plan of his own.
