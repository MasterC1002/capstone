Route 7 - Inbound to UW via Columbia will **not** divert via Regina Street. Outbound from UW via Columbia will continue to do so.

Route 12 - **Elimination of service west of Westmount.** The 12 will go west on University and straight down Westmount into Kitchener. For service west of Westmount (e.g: Keats Way

Route 29 - New two-way service between The Boardwalk and King/University and new evening/weekend service to replace the discontinued route 12. Service will be every 10 minutes heading to UW between Fischer-Hallman and King/University during AM rush until around noon. Service will be every 15 minutes during rush hours and every 30 minutes at other times. The 29 will **not** enter UW

iXpress - Will be renamed route **200**.

NEW Route 201 - New iXpress route servicing mainly along Fischer-Hallman, east on University, north on Hazel, and west on Columbia. Columbia Lake Village residents, **you can use this route as an alternative to route 13 to get to UW**. Note route 201 will **not** enter UW; you will have to get off at Columbia/UW stop. Service will be every 15 minutes during rush hours and every 30 minutes at all other times of the week.

Fall schedules are now available on the GRT website with the exception of route 201

As someone who lives on the west side of campus - no more detours: 

* a) around Bio1 / greenhouse
* b) through Bio2
* c) dismounting across Bomber's patio
* d) up the stairs northside of SLC

I'm Sean Hunt, the Board considered and approved the increase in tuition fees, effective for the Spring 2013 term. I've pulled out [the sections on the fee increases and the budget](http://csclub.uwaterloo.ca/~scshunt/uw-tuition-june-2013.pdf) from the Board agenda. Everything in that section of the agenda was approved as submitted.

**All governors of the University, staff, alumni, or just people from the community, are fiduciaries of the University. At a meeting of the Board, we are legally obligated to base our decisions on what we believe to be the best interests of the University, above our own interests and those of our constituents.** The requirement is re-iterated in the [Board Governance Principles](https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/governance/board-governors/governance-principles). After asking a number of questions and listening carefully to the discussion, the positives and negatives of a tuition fee increase

I've been disappointed with the relatively poor communication from the University to students about the timing of the fee increases. The administration could have and should have better explained this to students both in advance and this week when they rolled out the increases on Quest. I spent most of this morning running around trying to get critical information, and about the impact it will have on everyone (me included!) this term.

**Update 2:** Ok, and Metro News. Didn't expect all this!


I should say... Although I didn't mean to mislead anyone, but I think **it's really the concept of the event that's causing the reaction - not that it was called an orgy**. Unsurprising, there were shocked responses even when the event wasn't referred to as an orgy in my [original thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/uwaterloo/comments/16elg3/would_you_go_to_a_student_sex_club_adventure/) before it was deleted and remade as this. I wouldn't expect most people to be very open to the idea of going on a ""student sex club adventure"", though I know there are some who are open to things like this.

Describe the culture at your current co-op workplace for problem-solving. You can discuss your specific department or the entire organization. Who is involved solving problems? Who ultimately decides which solution to implement?  What processes or avenues are there for solving problems? Identify some of the pros and the cons of this culture.


Someone posted this answer:
This term I had trouble finding a job on Jobmine. Luckily, some speak Cantonese, and some even speak broken English.  Although my mandarin is not great, I get by. I also get by with the pay, which is 1.21¥ a day. The working hours are 6am to 9pm. An autocratic management style is implemented, as there is one boss and many workers. For example, lunch is recommended to be optional. I guess it is due to a lag in the project schedule. I work at a small desk, some other work at desks that are 1.5ft by 2ft. Along with my desk I was given a sewing kit. When it is dark outside
 
When solving problems, only the boss is involved in solving the problem.


For example, I was getting yelled at for not stitching fast enough. I was stitching as quickly as I could! I did not know how to tell him this. The main problem arose when he yelled at me for bleeding on his products. I bled because I tried to stitch faster than I am capable of. He did not believe this when I told him because he kept yelling. I don’t know if it is because my mandarin is not clear enough, which makes it a communication problem, or if my boss is just going through a rough patch in his life and taking his frustration out on me. He did not tell me how I could improve or breakdown the process and leave feedback. Instead he constantly yelled “更快”, which means “faster” in mandarin. Anyhow, I was able to increase my efficiency overtime, therefore solving the problem myself.
Another problem that occurred in the workplace began with a fire started by a soldering gun. To be honest, but he had told me to be quiet and continue working. He took a pale of water and threw out the fire which has spread from the 1.5 by 2ft table onto my fellow co-worker. My boss had single-handedly solved the problem again.


Another problem that occurred between specific co-workers and my boss occurred when it started to rain. Our building has a leaky roof


One problem that we were unable to resolve but eventually went away, I thought they were his friends who were going to ask him out to play baseball because they were all carrying bats. This mindset of mine changed when I saw them start hitting my boss and demanding that they pay them back. I wanted to call the police but there was no phone line at our company. I stood up and tried to run to help my boss but he yelled at me to get back to work. I was going to help anyways if I wasn’t restricted by the chain locked to my ankle. My co-workers in the other department, specialized in making iphones. I saw them frantically trying to assemble the iphones as quickly as possible so that they could call the police. By the time the men were done their bi-weekly meeting, they had left before my co-workers completed assembling their iphones.
 
There is only one process for solving problems: you either solve it or you don’t.
 
As for the pros and cons, so when I was bleeding, I have to wait until the day is finished so I can go to the local convenience store and spend my day’s pay on a bandage. Those days are inconvenient because then I wouldn’t be able to afford dinner. As for the pros, there are many! Our boss is kind, displayed by the leaky roof problem; forgiving, displayed by my bleeding problem; non-violent, displayed by the workplace violence problem (he never hit back).",False,,http://www.reddit.com/r/uwaterloo/comments/otzov/some_guys_pd6_exercise_lold/

I had the script try each ""word"".uwaterloo.ca site in turn and log the return code. If the result was 200 or 404(which was the code that it was giving for  redirect pages for some reason)

Two days later

A large number of them are ""Web server configuration/'Under construction':"", but never got around to it. Artifacts of a growing institution.

The ""Printers"" section seems to be the most likely to be abusable (from a security perspective). Obviously

""Permission Denied"" are interesting simply because I wonder what is lying behind the permission wall.

I've added a section at the bottom called ""Of interest"", or simply different.

Hopefully someone else finds this fun/useful. Going into the future

There are no official crosswalks on ring road. This means CARS HAVE RIGHT OF WAY. As explained to me by one of the campus police officers

Now let's think about this practically. I drive on ring road, drivers on ring road often yield to pedestrians and let them either cross or finish crossing without issues. But there are terrible spots on ring road, like right in front of CPH. It's a long curve and it's hard to see pedestrians with the wire fencing that's up around that corner. And at night, forget seeing pedestrians ahead. Pedestrians really have to be careful - I've had to jump on the brakes more than a few times because people either didn't see me or thought ""Hey! I'm gonna cross the road and the almost 4000 lb chunk of steel on wheels is just gonna magically stop on a dime!"" (Those are the best, I just figure Darwin's law will get 'em...*down the road*) We all know or have seen the suicidal idiots that don't look both ways before crossing the road.

REMEMBER: If the job/position is NOT currently in your active applications

**Applications Available** - This means this job is still taking applications and HAS NOT gone the process of screening through resumes. However

**Applied** - This means you applied to this job

**Screened** - This means they have screened everybody's resume.

**Selected** - This means you have been selected for an interview - go pick an interview time slot!

**Not Selected** - Unfortunately this means you haven't been selected for an interview.

**Alternate** - If one person or more decides not show up for an interview or something else happens

**Scheduled** - This means the scheduling for the interviews for this position have been filled and ready to go.

**Ranking Completed** - Here is where it gets tricky. So you can tell 3 things from this status.

1) If it says Ranking Completed but it is NOT in your active applications

2) If it says Ranking Completed and it is IN your active applications then congratulations you got ranked! So here you can check if you got an offer or not by looking at your active applications number and the number of applications you have left in your job inquiry. If you add these two numbers up and get &gt; 50 then congratulations you got an offer!

3) If not

**Filled** - The position has been filled by students.

**Employed** - Congratulations! You have been employed by this company!

**Cancelled** - The position was cancelled

**Unfilled** - The company did not fill up all the potential slots they could have.
 

Many companies tend to NOT update things on Jobmine so don't get your hopes up if it's the final week of ranking and a company still says APPLICATIONS AVAILABLE - they probably did interviews already and picked their candidates. Also

Lately I see more and more people coming to /r/uwaterloo for very sensitive questions that have to do with their plan, and possibly the next decade. While this is a community with the all-in-same-school predicate, please do keep in mind that more often than not, we are students without much authority, especially on official business, often with only anecdotal evidences to support our points.

Granted

If you have some grave situation or sensitive situation which require opinions of authorial

Solving a problem must always proceeded with gathering sufficient information. Only after preparing with sufficient information can you start asking for others' help, the second stage.
 **If you see your sensitive questions answered with multiple replies like *you should talk to your advisor*

*You should talk to the advisor if your questions are:*

* of academic planning(such as change-of-program) that you are not sure if you will be allowed to undergo.
* of intricate matter that may affect your (academic)career( *can I graduate with this average? without this course?*)
* of admissions issues that you need to know precise answers to( *what if I pass this course with a 54 and not 55?*)
* of intricate financial issues with regards to the school/admissions (*can I get OSAP this term? How much OSAP? What are my options?*)

*You should probably discuss here first if your questions are:*

* of academic planning that you are not sure if you can pull it off
* of intricate matter that may affect personal lives(*to counterpart the  second point of previous table.*)
* of admissions issues that you wonder what other people have done in past in similar shoes.(*could actually be the next step after talking to the advisors*)
* of financial issues with regards to the personnel ( *what's the best way to conserve money? earn money for tuition? etc.*)

Talking with the advisors help vastly just to understand your situation precisely

I've met a guy who relied only on anecdotal evidences for two years, that they couldn't even fit in the elective pool. It's dangerous.

**TL;DR: talk to your advisor

We're a group of UW students and alumni who have started an **unofficial** wiki for all things related to the University of Waterloo's history.

It's called **[The Warrior Wiki](http://warriorwiki.ca)** and can be found at **[warriorwiki.ca](http://warriorwiki.ca)**. It's based on the Mediawiki platform and looks and behaves just like Wikipedia.

**So much of the university's history has either been lost or forgotten

Students should have a repository where they can go to discover the facts about what happened on campus throughout history. Creating it in a wiki format enables students

The site is just starting out

Check it out. Perhaps you're president of CTRL-A

We'll also answer any questions you may have. So go ahead

Some highlights:

- A new 202 iXpress route along University Avenue, University, Labrador, Northfield. Stops at UW-Seagram (south entrance), University and Phillip. 15 minutes midday Mon-Fri service.

- The 201 iXpress has been modified from its previous terminus at Laurier to terminate at Conestoga Mall. New routing continues along Columbia

- The 200 iXpress has a new stop at UW - Columbia (the north entrance). This gives a transfer between the 200 and 201 iXpresses at UW - Columbia. The 200 iXpress still stops at UW - Davis Centre.

- Conestoga Mall will now serve as a hub for all three iXpress routes. The transfer between 200 and 201 at Laurier has been eliminated due to the change to route 201.

- With the new 202 iXpress, or 202.

- 31 Lexington now renamed 31 Columbia

- 13 Laurelwood routing modified to run between The Boardwalk and UW - Davis Centre via Laurelcreek Village neighbourhood. Offers two-way service in the Laurelcreek Village area instead of looping one way.

- Increased midday service to every 15 min on the 9 Lakeshore bus between UW - Davis Centre to McCormick and the 13 Laurelwood bus from Davis Centre to the Laurelcreek Village neighbourhood.

- 12 Fairview Park/Conestoga Mall modified routing between University and Weber and University and Lincoln; now runs south on Weber

- 5 Erb West has been renamed 5 Erb and combined with 6 Bridgeport. 5 Erb travels between The Boardwalk and the Bridgeport neighbourhood via Uptown Waterloo.

Just wanted to tell the story of Double Double Pizza and how they are by far the worst pizza place in waterloo. They have alright pizza

First, but nothing on the pizza. I suppose they thought we were too drunk to notice the difference, and maybe we were, but when we got back to our house we saw on the receipt that it had a few orders of ""Bacon Kromboo"" which.. who the fuck knows what that shit is.. but that was like, $4 for it. As well, extra cheese for $2, which we didn't get. Just to note

Second strike: a few months later we were lazy and the pizza place is right there. So, which the call center gives us a $5 off our next purchase.

The *only* reason there's a chance at a third strike is that they gave us that $5 off. We place our order through their call center

So, my follow up to that promise. I'm throwing it to you that this is *the worst* pizza place in waterloo. In fact, the worst pizza place I've ever been to, ever.

I was wrapping up my 1b term at the University of Waterloo

Fast forward to September 2011.
The new year was beginning and we started moving in. We pick up our keys, but this basement was nothing like the apartment we saw. 

*sidenote

Our suite was directly under the main entrance of the building, the other suite, had laminate flooring installed, and none of the aforementioned problems. We sent some emails to them and nothing really got repaired.

Throughout the year, the lock at the front of the building was broken, the glass at the back was shattered, and really sketchy people started showing up everywhere. We emailed and emailed and called to no avail. 
Also, and caused burns to the carpet.

Fast forward May 2012
I had just moved back in after 4 months on coop. There was a new problem. In the corner of the living room, the whole carpet had started getting visible moldy. We just gave up hope and fabreezed the fuck out of it at this point.

June 2012
We woke up one afternoon and saw that the puddle had grown. And every week it just got bigger and bigger. Now it was covering a quarter of the living room. I called and report flooding. I had to call 3 days straight before we finally noticed that someone had come. All they did was cut a hole in the wall and rip up the carpet.

So we took it to them. My buddy and I went to their office and complained. What was their response you ask?

'You guys are pouring water on the carpet to cover up burns.'

10+ litres of water (this carpet was SOAKED) 
The burns were on the other side of the fucking room

They gave us an air blower to dry it out. We agreed to this, and as soon as we took it away, the water spread again. 

On top of all of this

This is the email that we sent back: (after some legal help from a law clerk)

*To the owners and management of ------------------------:

Please be advised that we will not be paying the amount indicated on
the invoice. Pursuant to Residential Tenancies Act
(the “Act”)
to the rental unit or residential complex caused by the wilful or
negligent conduct of the tenant” (s. 34).  We categorically deny
causing any such damage to the unit during our tenancy.

Pursuant to the  Act
maintaining a residential complex
in a good state of repair and fit for habitation and for complying
with health, c. 17,
s. 20 (1)). Furthermore
to pay any amount as a result of a breach of a tenancy agreement
person entitled to claim the amount has a duty to take reasonable
steps to minimize the person’s losses” (2006
in breach of both of these sections of the Act. At the beginning of
the lease term
deemed to be ""not sufficient grounds for carpet replacement."" You did
not even bother sending anybody to clean it. When you finally did send
somebody to inspect the water damage to the carpet
the wall that was not even directly above the problem area. There is
no way to see the floor behind the wall with the hole that was cut.
(We have a video documenting this.)  We  also noticed that the water
spot tended to increase in size following heavy rain storms
indicating some sort of damage to the building's structure. However
when we brought up the water damage issue with the landlord
accused of ""pouring water on the carpet deliberately”
ridiculous
about the carpet for months. If you had bothered to investigate the
cause of the moldy smell properly when we first complained about it
the mold issue could have been dealt with sooner rather than later
minimizing the damage to the carpet.

We note that there are other outstanding maintenance and repair issues
with the unit and building. There is a large patch of black-coloured
mold behind the sink-side of the kitchen counter. We  informed you of
this and we were told that it would be removed. It was not removed.
Also
the building leading to the suites has a broken lock.

Given all the outstanding maintenance and safety issues with our unit
and the building, who
is in breach of certain of its obligations under the Act and our lease
agreement. As we have not caused any “undue damage” to the unit during
our tenancy
reiterate that we will not be paying the invoice.

Holy shit I got this email today! They must have redditors in UW Housing!

Good Morning Residents:
 
 
In 2012 the University installed window limiters in all UW residences across campus.  Over the past year many concerns due to the style of the original window limiters have been brought to our attention.  After much discussion and research we have resourced and purchased a new style of window limiter which may be removed when required at the tenant’s discretion.  Being able to safely and securely operate a window which has safe guards in place to help control the windows opening so as to prevent accidental falls
 
We are currently in the process of booking contract staff for next week to remove the old style of limiter and install the new style.  Another notice will be sent to you prior to completion as soon as the exact date has been finalized.
 
Thank you for your patience

Original post:
 
I live in CLV North. A couple of months ago, is to protect (kids assume) from falls from heights above ground level. They said the safety provided by these limiters will far overweight any disadvantages, and in case of emergency (like fire), the fastest way to escape is to break the window with a chair.

I can't help but think they are hiding something. They wouldn't remove the limiters for residents without kids (I tried). And the fire escape method is just ridiculous. I'm a girl with little upper body strength and no chair in my bedroom to break the windows in case of emergency. This is making me feel very unsafe because there are no good escape routes on the second floor. It's also preventing me from using AC in my bedroom.

Does anyone know of any housing bylaws that specifically prohibits these? Any help would be greatly appreciated.",self,t5_2rb5s,1367505291.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/uwaterloo/comments/1diq3l/is_this_legal/

The columns are divided equally so the main column with the content I care about gets the same screen real estate as the columns on the side that users rarely look at? I don't like reading the main content like it is a newspaper columns with a few words per line.

I’m 18

I did go on to university in the fall… I went to the University of Waterloo for Computer Science. I did horrible in my first term. I failed Honours Calculus, but I didn’t have to take the advanced CS. 

This was a punch in my self-esteem. I had graduated high school at the top of my class (95% avg) and math was one of my strengths. Moreover

Since I did so horribly and now had to repeat three courses for my next term

So my plan was to return to UW for CS after fixing and improving myself. Enter my toxic and controlling parents. They don’t want me to back to doing CS

They want me to go into nursing. Ryerson nursing. They want me to live at home and be a commuter. I might as well just kill myself now. I don’t want to be a nurse. I don’t think I’d be good a being a nurse. Although I am empathetic and compassionate, I’m guaranteed a job.
Also… I don’t want to live another 4-5 years with my family. I hate them. I am the scapegoat and the outcast. I need to get away from them. But I don’t have the resources. I don’t have money. And I am ill. But who gives a damn if I’m ill

I took the time off to study and attempt to cure my mental issues

“Get a job!” you say. But there are problems with that too.  First of all, mentally and physically, every fucking day. But who cares because my pain is invisible, right? It’s not like you’d yell at a cancer patient that they’re lazy for not getting a job.

I only have five more months till fall term begins again.

I don’t know what to do.

I should also mention that my parents threatened to cut off all support if I choose to go back to UW for CS. They’ve given me an ultimatum

I am already $6k in debt cause of my first term… I need to somehow pay OSAP back soon.

I only have one close friend who is also my boyfriend.

I want to die.

Help.

TL;DR Abusive parents gave me an ultimatum – they’ll cut of all support if I don’t do as they say. I have mental health issues and lack resources. I feel like I’m at a dead end and should just kill myself.

There wasn't.

Thankfully, so that they can show that the new system really is an improvement and that students will like it better. Based on the numbers I've heard, this is correct, and I would like to see this project come to fruition because I think it will improve students' timetables. But right now, nobody knows for absolute sure. The Registrar's Office is looking for feedback from students, and wants to know what questions to ask so that they can tweak parameters to produce a schedule that's as close to ideal as they can get.

**What I'm asking you to do:** Think about the things that you would like to see in scheduling

* What is your favourite time of day for classes?
* What is your least favourite time of day for classes?

Banning the sale of bottles of water will only result in an inconvenience for students rather than promote a better lifestyle which includes recycling and consuming less.

**WHERE TO VOTE**

If you are living in residence right now

If you're not on campus

**WHAT TO BRING**

Most people do not change their polling place from their ""family home""... despite the fact that you are now spending the majority of your time in Waterloo (at least 8 months a year; and with co-op

As a result

*YOU NEED*

If you are an eligible elector (Canadian citizen over 18 years of age living in the riding)

If you just moved into residence

According to the website, say some oaths, and affirm that you are a valid voter (I do this every year on principle)

**WHY IT MATTERS**

This riding has historically been very close:

* In the last provincial election
* In the last federal election

Polls have declared each major candidate this election as a likely victor (Lib

**POSSIBLE OUTCOMES?**

* Lib win: Liberals now have a majority. *BIG FUCKING DEAL*
* PC win: Increased support for Tim Hudack's platform
* NDP win: Pretty much nothing happens; except a show of support of the NDPs request during the Liberals last budget to impose a surtax of 2% on income over $500

**IN CLOSING -- VOTE!**

Everyone should try to vote tomorrow. And you should probably vote NDP :)

Or research the issues yourself. Feel free to take a look at each party's extremely nebulous platforms on the web.

**Bike on the correct side of the road.**
Its great now that its summer a bunch of people have pulled out their bicycles to travel around Waterloo. But come on

While we're on this...

**Bike on the road
Its very annoying to have to get out of the way of cyclists when I'm walking along on the sidewalk. Seriously, then walk or take the bus. Nobody gets to drive their cars on the sidewalk ""because they're too scared to use the road"".

**Use some form of turn signals.**
Again, wait your turn, and go. Making a left turn? Don't just stay in the bike lane, then zip across the pedestrian cross walk, you are going to freak out the cars around you.

And last for you bicyclists...

**WEAR A HELMET.** Just do it. What's the deal with nearly everyone not wearing one? Oh, wind in your hair feeling, but is risking your brain worth it? 

...And to those walking around on campus...

**Look before stepping out onto the road!** Just because you don't hear a car doesn't mean that someone isn't coming. More times than I care to think have I almost hit people because they'll just step out onto the road without looking. Of course, see me heading towards them, and just freeze there!",,False,self,t5_2rb5s,,http://www.reddit.com/r/uwaterloo/comments/i7opu/regarding_bicycling/

Here are a few things I kept in mind that helped lavished my first year with unforgettable memories:

1) EVERYONE is on the same boat as you (they don't know anyone here either). They are looking for the same thing. Treat everyone like you are their first friend EVER.

2) Forget who you were in high school. No one here knows who you were and they don't have to know. That chapter of your life is done...you can be who you are around people here

3) Don't limit yourself to one social circle. You may be inclined to stick with the first friends you met and clicked with but this is so if there is ever a falling out within the group social dynamics

4) Be neutral with the girls you meet...they are neither superior nor inferior to you. By this I mean, your work is 90% done. 

5) Don't drink before you try weed.

6) Devote at least 20 minutes each day to work (20 minutes is nothing and you will soon realize you will have to put in more hours but this is to get you started). This will be by far the most difficult thing in first year...way above making new friends and getting laid. 

7) Work out. Any way you can. Join intramural house teams. Buy a pull up bar (25$) and make an effort to do a few reps every time you walk in and out of your room.

1322683468.0,mv3w7,Why don't we pay equal fees for extra courses?,eastlog,19,5,25,"We all know that people in different programs pay different tuition fees. This has always been justified by the school by the fact that some departments require more money than other. For example the engineering department needs more money to fund its classes and support its labs than the Arts department. This would justify the higher tuition during a academic term  but I fail to see how this justification could be used for extra courses taken during a coop or off term.

A student in Engineering taking ENGL 101 in a non-academic term would have to pay $1127. An Arts student sitting in the exact same class would have to pay $611. If these are both extra courses any hidden fees hidden in the course price to offset department costs shouldn't be needed. It is costing the school the exact same price for each student to take the course but one student is paying almost twice as much.

TL;DR: Some students are required to pay higher course fees for no reason.

Company A wants to give me a base salary of $90

Company B wants to give me a base salary of $105

I'd rather work for Company A. Company A already knows about the salary from Company B and they used that knowledge to decide on their own offer. They also use the average salary of new grads (but I have a lot of internship experience)

I feel uncomfortable choosing Company A with such a big difference in the guaranteed salary but they seem like they'd be open to negotiation. What's a reasonable amount I should ask for from Company A so I can get the highest base salary that they're willing to give?

Can I even ask for more since technically $108000 &gt; $105000? Do I have to give reasons or can I say that's just what I want? I'm not sure what reasons they'd want.

**EDIT 1:**

I looked at my offer from Company B and it mentions something about a bonus but it doesn't say anything about percentages.

Does it sound reasonable to ask Company B about what this bonus usually amounts to or what percentages they've had in the past and then use that when asking for a higher base from Company A?

**EDIT 2:**

Company B emailed me that the last time they gave a bonus (which they do twice a year)

So based on this

We are currently in the process of adding the webform module to the profile, we started to ask ourselves ""why just do this for forms, why not do it at the server level for all content""?  

The most common objection is that it is a big CPU hit

 - Sites that need to embed 3rd party content that can't be delivered over https will end up with those messages saying that ""not all the content on this page is secure"".  

I don't think that this will happen often

 - Some sysadmins may block https on company websites. 

Shouldn't these people just be fired?  They're forcing employees to make less secure connections to the outside world.  Is this really still a thing that happens? 

Some popular sites have already started auto-redirecting traffic to https (github and twitter) and I get the sense that times are a changin'.. but maybe there is something I am missing.

Oh by the way

- What is the best way to get a part-time job. I used to just randomly distribute my resumes to stores or ask my friends to refer me when I was a high school student 5 years ago.

- Whether I should mention my co-op history or my current job (which is not related to customer service at all) on my resume. I don't have much experience in customer service, I was encouraged to write my work experience whether it was related to the job I applied for or not. It's just a good way to show you have some sort of professional experience interacting with people. Is this the same in this case?",,False,self,t5_2rb5s,1374959784.0,,
