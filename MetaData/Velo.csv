I still hang out with a lot of friends I knew before I got myself wrapped up in this spandex riddled world.  Now if I were to see one of them at a party or a bar their first question is usually

“how is the whole bike thing going for ya?”

Cycling has become a part of my identity.  They don’t know

Waking up at 5 a.m. so I can meet a few teammates for a ride before work or class started

I have been racing for a few years now.  Most of my teammates would probably describe me as a “pretty good rider.”  They likely would not embellish my talents any further than that. 

I wouldn’t argue with that description.  I consider myself pretty good.  Nothing special. 

I rarely if ever win a bike race. 

I put in months of preparation each year

In the heat of the moment I was disappointed

That said

I think this whole bike racing thing applies a lot to life in many ways.  We are all trying to improve ourselves no matter what we do.  We all want to win the race.  We all want to get that new job or a bigger salary.  The thing to realize

For my first post I’m going to talk about riding in pacelines. This may sound counter-intuitive, so I’ll make a follow-up post next week. In the next regular entry (two weeks) I’ll start writing about what tactics to employ when it’s time to make a move for the win. 

I apologize in advance that this may not be as exciting as a discussion on winning the Tour

[Open this diagram in a separate tab for reference.](http://shreveportbicycleclub.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/paceline_inset.jpg)

**P A C E L I N E S:** 

Pacelines are the most basic formations for a group of riders. They can be small (2 riders), good paceline skills and communication are essential. For now, let’s assume that everyone is working evenly on the front and the group is not attacking each other, like in a team time trial. You can still save energy compared to your break-mates!

**Single Paceline:** This is the most basic formation, corners, and the strength of riders in the group. After a rider finishes his/her pull, s/he will pull to the left and go to the back. Here are some tips for saving energy:

* Avoid braking. If you have to brake in the paceline, so you will need to pedal harder again to regain your speed. The best way to do this is NOT to look at the rider/wheel in front of you. If you are new to the sport this will feel uncomfortable and it may take some time to learn. Try looking 3-5 riders ahead and spot changes in pace ahead of time so that you can pedal *easier* for a few seconds instead of braking. If the rider in front of you makes a sudden move, your peripheral vision will catch it and respond. Trust your instincts, and focus your attention on what’s happening near the front of the group.

* When the person in front of you rotates off, you’ve had the longest rest in the group, you’re feeling strong, and you don’t want to look like the weak rider. The best way to ensure a steady change is to stay in the same gear and keep an eye on your cadence (or use speed). This should become habit, but the first few times you focus on it you may be amazed at your tendency to speed up when you pull through. In a team time trial, the surge will only hurt your teammates and break the rhythm. In a breakaway with opponents, you’re only doing more work than others and should be saving that energy for one big surge to get away later. Don’t waste it while they’re drafting you. Example: I was recently riding with a guy new on our team. I was riding at 300 watts, but after about 15 seconds I could return to 300w and cruise right by him. The bottom line is that surging like this tends to slow the group down

* Start accelerating before you’re at the back. You just pulled off and you’re tired; the last thing you want is to miss the tail end of the group and chase back through the wind. You should know how many riders are in your paceline and count them as you drift back. Shift to a higher gear with one or two riders to go and return to the group’s speed to get on the back of the line.

**Double Paceline:** A double paceline is just two single pacelines side-by-side. Riders pull off to the outside (beware or traffic on training rides as this makes the group four-abreast). This tends to form in larger groups when a rider would spend a long time rotating to the back after pulling in a single paceline. The same basics apply to this formation

**Rotating Paceline:** A rotating paceline can be one of the most efficient formations as long as all members are working together. Communication is really important, just ease up a little bit. Don’t show off by taking a longer pull; doing so only exposes the slow lane to the wind and ruins the power savings for the rider that should be behind you. When you get to the back of the slow lane, accelerate and get back in the fast lane. The acceleration is easier than in a single paceline because there are two people, side-by-side, protecting you from the wind. This formation tends to work better with medium sized groups (6-12), but can work in smaller or larger groups with good communication.

**Echelons:** Echelons occur when there is a crosswind, riders line up diagonally across the road to find the most protected area from the wind. Wheels will overlap, and riding in this formation requires good bike handling skills, good communication, and trust for the riders around you. As a reference point, I typically get my brake hood as close to the rider’s hip in front of me as I think is safe. This depends on strength of the wind and how much I trust the rider in front of me.

If the wind is from the right, ride behind the echelon, and rejoin on the back left side. The acceleration is harder since you will need to go around the last rider and move forward.

* * * * * 

OK, we’ll start getting to the fun stuff like attacking out of the group and, hopefully, winning!

1335888812.0,t1ne9,Things I learned as a first time support car driver,flourandbutter,42,1,13,"
Hello again r/Velo!


So a few weeks ago I posted this:
http://www.reddit.com/r/Velo/comments/shh8w/tips_for_first_time_support_car_driver/


Having done the race now I thought I'd share what we learned in case you might be thinking about volunteering yourself. There's also some tips for riders with support cars farther down.


a) Practice beforehand. I got my best friend (who's a cat 5) to ride next to my car while we practiced taking and handing out bottles on both sides of the car as well as fast wheel changes. Made for a lot less surprises at the actual race.


b) No ""Sticky/Turbo/Booster"" Bottles unless you're driving behind an elite race where the riders might know how to do that.


c) Turn off your music so you can hear the race radio. All hail the mighty race radio.


d) Do all your feeds on the right side of the car if possible. This puts you in between the rider and oncoming traffic. Plus your co-driver can lean out of the car if the rider doesn't want to get too close.


e) Open the wrappers on bars/gels/bananas before handing them to the rider. 


f) Put your blinkers on


g) When you stop to swap wheels, I'd go to the bike and get the wheel off while she grabbed a new wheel from the back of the car and brought it to me. I'd put the new wheel on while she'd put the old one back in the car and then get back in. I'd give the rider a push and then get in and get moving again.


h) Ask the organizer or an official if it's ok to let riders draft off you at this event. For Quabbin the dropped riders from earlier races could draft but the ones for the race we were following couldn't.


i) Give the dispatcher updates on your location from time to time. It makes it easier for them to keep the EMTs nearby.


j) 9 times out of ten, stay with the pack.


h) Avoid passing dropped riders on descents. If you have to (like if you're stuck behind dropped riders and the pack is getting away)


And here's some tips for racers at an event where there's a wheel car:


a) Quick release lever goes on the left side. Also, or straight towards the center of the rear triangle. For front skewers don't put them flush with the fork leg. That way the wheel car can get you back on the road much faster.


PS: Don't over-tighten your skewer. That slows things down.


b) If you need a  rear wheel


c) Do not lean on the side mirror of the support cars. It will abruptly fold back and you might fall. If you need to hold on to the car, or the roofline. Practice leaning on the car with a friend you trust.


d) Don't get pissed at the person changing your wheel or fixing your bike on the side of the road. They're doing the best they can and cussing them out won't get you moving again any faster.


e) Check your bike before the race. If you aren't a competent mechanic


d) If you want to draft off the car


e) When you've been dropped


f) If you have been dropped and the support car is beeping his horn at you

g) Lastly, sit in a car driving fairly slowly (for a car) for a few hours wishing they were on their bike, and then drive back home wishing they could be on their bike, usually without getting paid. In all likelihood they woke up earlier than you did and will have to stick around until well after the race. Saying thank you really means a lot.",,False,self,True,t3_t1ne9

1361894180.0,199i5n,Tactics Series Entry 2.5 - Pack Riding,like2ridebikes,39,0,12,"Hi everyone! Today I’m making a follow up post to last week’s post on saving energy in [pacelines.]( http://www.reddit.com/r/Velo/comments/18tjl4/tactics_series_entry_2_pacelines/) Like last week, but without the legs to execute it your move will go nowhere. This is important for conserving energy so you have the most energy possible to commit to your attacks.

**PACK SHAPE:** 

**Wide -** When the pace is slower

**Narrow -** When things speed up, and at the highest speeds the pack will evolve into a giant paceline. Often we see a long paceline on the front with a “V” shaped pack attached to the back. At a certain point, someone has decided that they’re willing to sacrifice some draft because they’re just not willing to go any further back. [Note that in professional races the pack will be spread across the entire road at the highest speeds as they set up their leadouts for the finish. This is an exception to this generalization; we’ll definitely talk about leadouts here. This happens a lot less frequently in amateur racing.]

**POSITIONING:** Ask anyone for advice on any race, but if there are 50 people in a race, all of whom want to be ‘at the front,’ some of them will be left at the back. There are certain advantages of being near the front – better cornering, lower risk of crashing, visibility of race tactics, pack splits

When the race is approaching a section that can split the field (i.e. crosswinds, all it takes is one person who can’t hold the wheel in front of them, and all of a sudden you’re in the second group and may need to bridge to the main pack. This is a huge waste of energy. Many times you may not even realize that the pack is splitting, especially if you are suffering and not focusing so far ahead.

**MOVING UP:** The race is coming up on a critical moment, the lower your chances of expending a lot of energy.** When the pace is slow, the pack often takes up the entire width of the road, and even though you’re not working hard and have plenty of energy, there simply isn’t a path forward. Try to get to one side of the road, and you will have to wait for a path to open up. Luckily, as the race approaches a critical point it will speed up and lanes will open, try to do it in a tailwind section. **The worst situation is to move up in a headwind on your own.** You’ll probably burn so much energy that you’ll go straight back at the next surge.

Another great time to move up is when the pace slows down, but when a surge lets up most people are happy for the break and start coasting, leaving the lanes open for a few seconds. Keep working for just an extra 10 seconds and you can make it right up to the front.

Of course it’s ideal to be near the front all the time, technical corners, and crosswinds. We’ll talk about these situations in future threads.**

**CORNERING:**OK, and bad cornering can make you go from the front of the pack to tailgunning in a single lap. You will be amazed at how tight of a corner you can take while still pedaling and not clip a pedal. If you have a normal 2-lane road and 90-degree corner, you should be able to pedal through the corner as long as it’s not downhill or tailwind going in. It’s a good idea because using your Zone 6 has a much higher physiological cost per energy than Zone 1 or 2. If you can take three or four easy pedal strokes through a corner that could save one really hard pedal stroke on the way out. Do 30 laps of a six-corner course and that adds up.

Eventually I will make a whole post dedicated to crits

After the normal spiel of rules, once the downhill leveled off, the guys in the front would drastically slow, which caused several close calls. One junior locked up his rear wheel and almost took someone out. The hill repeats I've been doing must really be paying off, because the short climb didn't phase me. I easily could have overtaken most of the pack on the hill, but opted to stay in the back. I continued drafting with minimal exertion for a while. Kept forgetting to look at the lap counter, so I had no idea how much longer we had. I just kept my head down and stayed on whatever wheel was closest. I finally looked down once as we were on the back climb and my timer on my computer said something like 26 minutes. My heart started racing. Could it be! Were we about to hit the final lap?! Was I actually going to finish the race with the pack!? I couldn't believe it! I had tons of energy to spare and decided I was going to give it my all. As we crossed and the bell rang, which really gave me a boost. Everyone dropped the hammer. I stayed on a wheel in about 15th until we came to the hill. I made my move too soon and got spent. I thought for sure I would get dropped and finish last. I grabbed a wheel around 10th and managed to catch my breath. The finish line was in site. The final lap had averaged about 28 mph, I was right around 6th...maybe 7th or 8th. As soon as I crossed the line

Everything I've learned over my 1 year of racing finally meshed. I stayed on a wheel almost the whole race, shifted at the right times, braked at the right times....it just went great. I really think that if I hadn't made that mistake on the back hill on the final lap, I could have won. Maybe next time. Next week....CYCLOCROSS!",,False,self,False,t3_1k3jea

[This is the finish](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=VDFb79qenaI#t=612s). It should play from 10:15 and I’m in the blue top coming up the left. I feel like my move might be considered dangerous (too close on the inside?)

Anyway

1. Definitely attack at some point. The first time I ever attacked I got a small gap but quickly redlined into uselessness and I finished last. I was really hesitant to have a go again. [My attack this weekend](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=plOk60MQgIk#t=933s) didn’t stick, I went up with the peloton and then powered up and over the top. I held a 9 second gap with another rider for ¾ of a lap, but we didn’t really have the juice to extend it and make it stick so early in the race. We got brought back, but had time to recover. The guy I broke with eventually came in second place. So the break didn’t work, but we gained some insight on the course -- where it was difficult solo, how it felt to charge toward the lap line, things you don’t get a feel for in the peloton. It got our bodies ready for that kind of push, but I slowly crept my way back to the front after recovering, guaranteed. 

2. Read your opponents. I spent a lot of time looking at people this race. Trying to see what their bodies were saying, trying to see if their physical state showed in their face, little things that can tell you a lot about where a person is at and what they are planning. I oddly found this to be kinda, calming in some way.

3. Conserving energy is not just about staying in the peloton. Practice different seat positions that will use different leg muscles. In that break, so I wanted to make sure I had those muscles ready. The last 3 laps, I sat up, handled the bars near the stem, and sat as far back on my seat as I could and climbed that way, gearing as needed to stay with the front ten. I ended up needing those legs as we charged up the hill later and made a long sprint for the finish.

That's it from this race. Right now

**Every ride should be broken into intervals.  Every interval should be as intense as you can continuously sustain for the given time period.  As the season progresses from the beginning to end

That's it.  There's no magic

Ok, Base3, Build 1, Build 2, Peak/Race, and Rest.  With the exception of the last two, there is no clear distinction between periods

Base1: (ALL Z2 ALL THE TIME!!)Start with as many hours as possible in zone 2.  20 hours/week or more is preferable, not because you blasted up the hills.  If you go on standard group rides, you'll get dropped anytime the pace picks up, but you'll drop them when they all slow down to talk or be lazy.

Base 2: (Z2/Z3)  Keep the Z2 stuff up on your longer days, see keep it well under Z4, but do as much Z2 and Z3 as you can.

Base 3:  (Z3/Z4)  Start working one or 2 Z4 workouts in per week.   Options include 1x15

Build 1:  Z4.  3 (or more)  LT workouts per week plus one ridiculous group ride. (destroy/get destroyed by your friends)

Build 2: (more Z4/less Z5) Work in 1 or 2 Z5 workouts (3x5, etc.) while keeping the Z4 going strong.  Group rides should start to feel like long races.

Build 3: (less Z4

Peak/Race.  This is personal

Some things to keep in mind:  You obviously can't do this for every race.  Pick the most important race of the season, I did this and won 2 major (to me) races on back to back weekends.  If you have an important race relatively early in the season, take a week of rest and start over at Build 1 (or 2, whatever you have time for).
Each period should last about a month


This post got super long and I haven't said nearly enough yet.   I skipped the 'why' and just talked about (some of) the 'how.'  If you want to know why this plan works so well, I'll ask any questions you'd like and I'll get more specific in the next post.

Credentials:  I started cycling seriously at 25.  Upgraded from Cat 5-Cat 1 in 5 years.  I spent 1 complete season as a 3, and now I work a full time job that doesn't permit the sort of hours necessary to race against 1s and Pro's.  I'm not interested in being mediocre at racing, so I now ride for fun and enjoy sharing what I've learned on the internet.

Disclaimer:  You should read The Cyclists Training Bible, what I've picked up by critically reading stuff online, and the experiences of myself and my teammates.  If you think I""m ripping off Friel, I probably am, but he wasn't the first or the only person to have published what I'll be referring to as 'the plan.'  His book also has a lot of what (in my opinion) is just filler designed to kill time and fill pages.  No matter how effective, you can't sell a training plan if it's only a few pages long.  Also, if you have 1 hr of intervals to do on a particular day, you need to fill the rest with something.  The solution to both of these is the filler that doesn't really make you faster on the bike:  Spin ups,"" which is really what they accomplish.",t5_2s4ji

Starting from the beginning, but I'll make sure to leave earlier the next time) with /u/SneakyKiwiz. Then the time came to line up at the start, I wasn't incredibly nervous and I was just trying to remember all the tips you guys had given me. Once the whistle blew I clipped in an next thing I know I'm in the middle of the group doing about 27 mph. The first corner wasn't bad and I held my line through it and didn't get yelled at so that was good but I definitely got a feel of the accordion effect. So it continued pretty steadily like that, continuously jockeying for positions and whatnot, all the while I just kept remembering what you guys were saying, if you're not moving up, you're moving back. So I had worked my way towards the front 1/4 of the pack around the 10th or 11th (out of 15) lap and my lungs were burning but I felt good, big mistake.

First let's talk about training zones.  First I'll give a name, however if you can afford it, a power meter (and the correct training plan to go with it) is the best money you can spend in cycling, outside of a simple bike and healthy food.  You use roughly the same percentages for HR or rate of perceived exertion (RPE)

Zone 1: Recovery (0-50%)(all day):  The hard part about Z1 is forcing yourself to ride easy enough in it.  It's very common to creep up into Z2

Zone 2: Base.(50-75%)(all day)  The biggest misconception about base is that it should be easy.  It shouldn't.  Base rides are very long; and at the end of a 4 hour day, but you should be dropping them when they stop to chat afterwards.

Most people just use base as an excuse to ride easy in the early season.  There is a time for riding easy, base should be swapped out for endurance and LT work.

Zone 3:  Endurance(75-85%) ~~(30 mins - 1 hour)~~ (1-4 hours

Zone 4: LT(86-105%) ~~(10-30 mins)~~(15mins-1 hour);  Lactate Threshold.  Also called anaerobic threshold (AT), and what is going on in your body

LT is the holy grail of cycling.  Of course other things are important, the power at which you can recover goes up, so at a certain speed in the race while others are working a little, you are recovering.  Similarly, when others are dipping into their V02MAX reserves during a surge or hard effort, if you can hold the same speed but stay in your LT zone, you can ride for twice as long as they can before giving out.  Everything done in terms of fitness training is about raising your power produced at LT.

Zone 5: V02Max(106-140%) (15 mins - 1 min)  This is the power associated with a surge or an attack in a race.  It's not an all-out sprint

1.  Surges tend to be when people get dropped in races.  Attacks are how you get away.  You can have LT for days, but they can't get away or sprint, so they finish 20th or whatever.

2.  Training V02MAX intervals can increase your LT.   I was hesitant to believe this because I don't like the short

Zone 6+:(150%+) (0-1 min.)  Anaerobic/Sprint.  What it sounds like.  If you get to the end of a race and you aren't alone, and the majority of their training isn't even on the bike, it's weight training and plyometric stuff.  I'm a horrible sprinter and won't be giving much advice on how to sprint in groups larger than 5.  I'm sure a pure pack sprinter can give you all the advice you need if you're willing to ask.

Intervals:  An interval is simply a stretch of time where you're doing a single effort.  It doesn't have to mean 2 minutes of pain.  It could be a 20 minute LT interval

Intensity:  Intensity refers to how hard you are riding.

Volume:   Volume refers to the duration of your ride.  Most people will measure volume in hours

2x20, but represents the rest between intervals in that set.  If I go out and do 3x10's that means I'm riding for 10 minutes, resting, and repeating for a total of 3 intervals.  5x2x2 means 5 intervals, 2 minutes long, with 2 minutes of rest in between.

Power/weight.  (measured in watts/kilo) is a popular metric people on the internet use to compare against each other.  It's often called the eWang, it's a great way to track progress and take into account weight loss or gain when gaining or losing power.  The value commonly accepted as the maximum human capacity at LT is 6 W/kg.  This is the number guys like Schleck, Contador, and Cuddles are capable of in recent years.  Lance (and most of his team) regularly did 7 back in the day....

It was my fourth race ever. Not a big deal, so we just race with the slower of the two men's groups. 

Last week we raced with the men. First race of the year. There were 3 women - two very good, I fought to get back on, and did successfully for a good portion of the race. 

So this week

So the race starts off. It's super windy. I hang out in the front 1/3rd - but not right at the front, it feels like there's no wind, and all the girls in front are doing the hard work. My cornering is much better than last week. I can tell some of the girls have never raced because they're swerving all over the road - I just about got my wheel taken out a few times. 

Most of the race goes flawlessly. My positioning is right to deal with the wind, but I don't care as long as I finish in the pack. They put up the sign - 3 laps to go. 

Two laps to go. To this point the pack has been pretty tight - it's not overly competitive. There are girls here that could take off and destroy everyone if they wanted to. 

But then my mistake - the 4 girls from the same team at the front put out an attack with a lap and a half to go. Right into the wind. I'm right behind them (and I should note - the only women on my team so I have no one to work with). But I waited too long. The stupid thing is.. I saw them getting ready. I could tell from their body language that they were preparing to take off. But I waited too god damn long - they were 10 or 15 feet ahead of me when I decided to get way too cocky and think I could catch up with them. I went for it, I would have ended up right back where I was, not wasted my energy, and been in a fine position to end the race. Instead, I'm in last. 

By some miracle I managed the JUST about get back on the group with a ton of hard work. The group was speeding up and girls were getting dropped left and right. The stronger girls had already taken off off the front and it was a pretty spread out group. I passed 3 or 4 that got dropped

This was the first time I raced where the competition was actually fair, cost me my first chance to actually place. Considering I race with the men and generally keep up for a good portion - this should have been easy. I should have had no problem against a bunch of girls that had never raced. But I ended up at the back of the pack, and for a bit - last. 

So mad at myself. 

**TL;DR** Did well in a race until 4 girls broke off the front and I tried to catch them on my own because I got cocky. Instead died from the sprint and finished poorly.",self,t5_2s4ji,1367413980.0,,ca,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/Velo/comments/1dh7yy/race_report_first_allwomens_crit/

I picked this race in particular because the course looked pretty newbie-friendly. It's a wide course - there are two 90-degree left turns and then a long gradual curve to bring you back to the line. I got to the race early this morning, and waited to start.

The pace was a little easier than I expected. I've been doing some practice crits and hard group rides lately that killed me by comparison. That's not to say the race was *easy* (otherwise I would have had a better result)

Once I realized that I probably had the fitness to finish with the pack, I found myself at the front even though I didn't intend to contest it. It took me a while to realize that everyone was going to sit on my wheel for as long as I'd let them (or until I blew up). I think I burned some matches, especially when I backed off the pace to let some riders pass and got blocked out of some wheels. I had to fight to gain position all over again.

During the last few laps

I've got the bug and am looking forward to racing again in a couple weeks. I think that I've got some work to do in terms of tactical awareness and sprint power (probably more the former). I'm pumped that I was able to meet both of my goals this time around.

How long is the learning curve? I suppose it's probably different for everyone

1. **Protect your front wheel at all times.**
If you always look out for your front wheel then you can get out of most bad situations. The only place I would ever overlap is if there are two cyclists in front of me to either side so it is impossible for them to come over and hit my wheel.
2. **Look ahead**
Don't stare at the person in front of you. Look 3-5 maybe more people ahead of you. It's easier to see how to pack is moving and you'll be able to anticipate surges/slow downs better. 
3. **Hold your line**
Pretty self explanatory
4. **Be predictable**
Don't make sudden movements. It is possible to put out a lot of power and be smooth at the same time.
5. **Know when to back off**
Be aggressive, get in a good position. 

That's basically what I can think of now. I've been in plenty of races with sketchy riders

1362526375.0,19qml5,Training Series Entry 3 - Leadouts,like2ridebikes,26,1,22,"Today I’m going to write about leadouts. Leadouts are one of the most basic tactics in principle

TV commentators almost always describe a leadout as

* Giving your team leader a head start

* Putting a large percentage of opponents out of contention

In order for this tactic to work you need to have a group of riders who are able to ride at the very front and also be willing to sacrifice their result completely. Ditch your Mark Renshaw illusions of coasting across the line in second place with your arms up celebrating your teammate’s win. Think about all the hours you spend at work each week; those guys are out practicing their leadouts. You squeeze in an hour each week with your teammates to practice this. They are professionals

In an amateur race, your best bet is to have one or two domestiques and try to use other riders to start your leadout.

**So

Remember last week we talked about pack shape. When the race gets fast, all hovering near the front. As your teammate increases the pace and the pack narrows, some of them will not get a good spot in the line, and are forced either to burn their energy in the wind to stay near the front, or they take a bad spot in line. It’s a catch-22 for them, because if they stay at the front they won’t have any energy for the actual sprint, and if they stay back in the draft they won’t be able to make up such a great distance in the final. Now, there are three. 

Assuming you have four riders (one leader,here’s how this would go. Your ‘other’ [sorry, couldn’t think of a good term] will make sure that your team is near the front with about 5km to go. He won’t ride the front, but if people start moving up he’ll go into the wind briefly to match those moves and keep you out of the wind. You don’t want your team to get boxed in, so this rider’s job is basically to keep your team in a position where you can take the front when you need to. Your first leadout rider takes the front with 1500m to go and just goes as hard as he possibly can until 500m to go (about 90 seconds). He needs to commit to this, 500m to go is his finish line and he sprints like it is. This pace should also serve to discourage any attacks.

**The head start.**

Now you’re at 500m to go and there is one leadout rider in front of you. His finish line is 200m to go. If he doesn’t go fast enough, you don’t need to be the fastest sprinter to win! You already have at least a one-bike-length lead on everyone else.

**Other uses of a leadout.**

TV commentators really only use the term ‘leadout’ when talking about a sprint, descents, or any time you want to ensure that you are in a good position.

This can all sound easy in theory

**Looking for help here:** I’m not a sprinter

Mr. Johnson

I would like to express my displeasure with USA Cycling and UCI'c enforcement of your rule 1.2.019(the registered Pro team fine for racing unsanctioned event fine). I have raced mountain and road bikes for over 10 years. I have bought day licenses many times as our local sanctioned series has been on the verge of bankruptcy for years and one of the poorest run businesses I have ever seen. Races start late, this letter is to inform you that me nor any of our team will race any USA Cycling event on a one day licence or a year license. We are also sending letters of support to ALL local and national promoters that are not converting to USA Cycling.

I'm not really a cyclist

Anyhow, which was what I was most nervous about pre-race. I took my turn in the wind at the start of the last lap. Whoops. I dropped back into the pack to recover for a few seconds before the sprint and was able to climb back up to a 6th place finish, of about 10 in the pack and another 10 off the back.

So [this is the bike I did this on](http://i.imgur.com/jyj6Hl0.jpg) (EDIT: I did have clipless pedals though). Don't worry, and a bunch even had carbon wheels. My wheels are deep V's with extra beefy spokes that I built up when I weighed 280.

I'm thinking about renting a low end race bike for next week. Do you guys think it would make a difference or should I stick with my 30lb monster that fits perfectly?

EDIT: Thank you all so much! There's an incredible amount of great advice in here and it's all come from such a small community. Plus not one person made me feel unwelcome as a beginner or called me a fag. I like you

This week has been crazy with studying and taking all my finals for the semester. Yesterday

There were about 75 guys who signed up for the race, only 55 showed up. The race started on the same 5 mile climb that we would finish on. We slowly went over it, and it took me the whole climb just to move to the front. As we got up to the top, hail started to come down. I moved to the front and led the descent so that I wouldn't be in any danger. It was tough to even look up with the stinging ice coming down. Eventually we got low enough and it turned in to rain. Not much better because it started pouring down. Within 20 minutes of starting the race, we were completely drenched.

After the descent, the grade picked up pretty steep and so I made a little move, just to check out how strong the field was. I noticed two things. One, my legs felt like jello from the cold. Two, the whole field stayed and seemed very strong. We got over the top of the climb and out of the rain and hail only to descend into the wind and the cold.

The next forty miles I spent mostly sitting in. There were a couple solo attacks, just to try and warm up and get my legs going a bit.

About a mile before the last climb up to the finish

A couple of teams starting forming in the front to lead out their guys and bring back any solo attacks that went off. I hovered behind them and stayed with the accelerations. At this point guys starting popping. We were probably a mile out from the finish and the grade started to pick up again. Another solo attack went and got a pretty good gap. The only guy with a teammate left in our group put his guy in the front to close it down. The teammate popped after closing most of the gap down

The guy who had his teammate bury himself launched first and early. At that point I was sitting 4th or 5th wheel. He bridged the gap quickly and moved on, about 75 meters from the line, maybe 5 guys on our wheel. I picked it up and kicked as hard as I could, putting a small gap on everyone. I held it to the top and managed to hold it all the way to the line for the win.

The bad weather makes this one so much more satisfying. This race was also the first real race in Utah of the season but I'm pleased that I can throw down with the 3's and 4's.

I had given my legs a good thrashing the day before at the 53-mile Cat 4 Page Valley Road Race, and indeed I hadn't even planned on racing them at all until a teammate said he was considering them earlier in the week...and then decided not to race *after* I registered. So I was racing without teammates to help -- but I did have friends on other teams in the same fields, and so at least I wouldn't be alone and might even be able to form an alliance. Warm-up was fairly *blah*, just spinning on a trainer in Z1-Z2 heartrate (and maybe 80% FTP) for half an hour, with a few minutes at FTP thrown in (which barely bumped my heartrate into Z3), and then a lap of the course.

In the Cat 4/5 race it became VERY apparent that I was racing with Cat 5s - many riders seemed to have a lot of trouble clipping in, left a lot to be desired (including myself, though I did better as the laps wore on). Several laps in we have a slow-down caused by a slight rise (I did say there weren't any real climbs - I meant there wasn't anything that we'd need to go in the red for), and of course the peloton bunches up...and we have our first crash of the day which although it was just in front of me, I managed to avoid. One lap later, a rider seemingly flips himself out of the peloton and into the grass for no reason (looking back at the video, he seems to have crossed his own front wheel and overcorrected). The rest of the laps were pretty uneventful

On the final sprint, this means that I should get 2 points towards my upgrade. I had 16 points going into the race, and so 2 points gets me to 18 and will help make my case for upgrading (along with the pack finishes and top 10s that I've accrued over the past couple seasons).

The Cat 3/4 race was faster and longer, a 4 man break popped off the front and I was able to jump into the chase, and then bridge across when the chase stalled. However, I wanted to latch on and become dead weight to the break to shut them down, since I was still a little unsure about being able to finish well and I wasn't really interested in working that hard anyways. I followed a few more attacks, but ultimately the group stayed together and it came down to a group sprint at the end. Again, I started from wayyy too far back

So I had fun, and cemented my decision to apply for the upgrade to Cat 3 after this weekend (even though I don't quite have the points).

I had my helmet-cam mounted

Thanks also to the people in this [thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/Velo/comments/xsxoq/hey_rvelo_most_road_race_seasons_are_winding_down/) everyone's advice was extremely helpful!

I worked this morning

The course is a short 1km loop with two sharp turns and 2 not-sharp-at-all-turns.  The home straight had a nasty head wind today, did my registration dealio, and talked to some guys on my LBS's race team.  We warmed up together and then got to the line.

I had myself position in the middle of the line at the front in the field of 15-25 riders.  The ref say go

The peloton enters the turn no more than 2 wide and I'm sitting between 10-15.... All of a sudden I see a duck just waddling across the road.  He's approach from the inside of the turn and he's about 20m ahead of me.  He gets to the outside of the road where us riders are swinging to from exiting the turn and he, both of which I'm behind...  The duck seriously could not have given less fucks.  The two riders both have slam on their brakes (skid marks were made) to avoid nailing the duck and I'm thinking to myself ""Are you fucking kidding me.... first race, first lap, and I'm going to crash... all because of a retarded duck.""

I quickly ease on the brakes and appropriate amount to try and avoid hitting the riders and to avoid getting rear-ended.  Everyone makes it through the turn without crashing.  I think to myself ""Fuck yes, and behind now by quite a margin.  We get organized once more about 1/2 through the front stretch and head wind.  I sit towards the back of group two getting a feel for the speed and trying to take in everything that is going on around me.

After a few laps sitting towards the back of the group

This was a very bad idea... The 2 riders I had been sitting behind were clearly more experienced and stronger than I

I **think** this is what ended up happening... but I can't be sure... a little gap formed between me and the rider whose wheel I wanted to get onto and the head wind proved too much for me.  I lost the group two and took a few riders with me T__T.  After one lap of me leading this small group the rider behind me signaled to grab his back wheel when he took off to catch group 2.  I jumped slightly too late and got crushed again by the head wind trying to keep his back wheel.  Now all I could do was suffer as I was in no mans land.  I pushed as hard as I could being alone and after 4 laps of me being alone the leaders caught me.  

The cat 2 rider who I've been taking to a lot at the LBS told me when this happened to get up and sprint to insert myself into the group.  That's what I did.  I hung with them for 2 laps and it was so much easier than being alone

I didn't stop moving after I crossed the line.  I kept riding (thanks for the advice velo! :D)

All in all it was a good experience.  Didn't crash, booyah.  I had done a lot of riding during the day and my ride to get to the crit area was longer than every other rider.  My actually riding time before the race started was an hour and a half... I don't know if that has anything to do with my performance but I'm sure it doesn't.  I'm going to have to ride that much every time I go anyway so might as well get used to it... haha.

I think I can safely say I'm addicted

1367243378.0,1dc56s,Race Report: First Cat 5 Crit,smithtys,21,1,18,"I know /r/Velo just couldn't wait to have another Cat 5 race report

Spoiler alert: It ends as you expect it to.

So this season a local bike shop and brewery decide they want to enter the team sponsorship fray. For reasons wholly unknown to me (other than I spend too much money at both places) they ask me to join the team. I sign up and then find out they've decided to launch a brand-new crit in our downtown as part of a local heritage festival. No problem, but I owe it to my sponsors to be in this race and support their cause. Suck it up.

We get lined up and right away my teammate and I are in a bad spot (no fault of our own; the way they lined us up was screwy

We spend 2-3 laps (don't remember exactly) moving up by surfing wheels before a guy we know is getting back in after a mechanical. Having ridden with this guy a few times in the past I know he's going to kill himself to get back to the lead group and that's exactly what he does, is riding on a CX bike with CX gearing) catches up about a half lap later. We've both used more energy than we'd have liked to at this point, but we're top 15 now, in the lead group and feeling ok. 8 laps to go.

As the laps tick away, pass the less experienced folks with 1 lap to go, and then have a decent finish (we weren't going to win, but we could maybe do top 5, certainly top 10).

2 laps to go and friends are emphatic that we need to move up. We do jump up a few spots and are now somewhere around 10-12 in the lead group. But it's starting to string out

Just as we approach the Start/Finish for the last lap we make our move. I get on my teammates wheel and we move up several spots - probably 8/9 or thereabouts, and things start to get sketchy. Hit the first corner and we're carrying some speed (90-degree right turn) and it's a short straight into a 90-degree left-hander. Problem is the straight is 4 lanes wide and it slams down to 1 lane for the left. I'm out of position (more in the middle of the road than I'd like) but no biggie - I can handle the turn from here, I just can't carry as much speed as I want out of it. Hit the left and a guy on my right panics - doesn't hold his line, hammers his brakes, and starts forcing me into the curb. I start yelling ""Inside! Inside! Inside!"" which he seemed to take as some sort of instruction for him to deviate even further from his line. I laid my bike over as far as I could and hoped for the best, but it wasn't to be...lost the rear wheel and down I went (thankfully I didn't take anyone else out and, due to being the the break, but could have been a lot worse.

Definitely bummed because I actually felt ok during the race and wasn't as terrified as I'd expected. My teammate ended up finishing 12th as he lost a couple of places looking around for me after the crash and then couldn't do much to wind up his sprint with a 46T big chainring. But it was his first crit

Lessons learned:

1. There's no truer adage than

2. You don't need your brakes as much as you think you do. Get off the gas a bit sooner, apex, and then get back on the gas. A lot faster than pedalpedalpedalBRAKEBRAKEBRAKEpedalpedalpedal and your legs will thank you for it.

3. Be in the top 1/3 of whatever group you're in. At the end

4. Don't wait until the last lap to move up. Get in the position you want to be in with at least a couple of laps to go.

5. Crashing sucks,False,self,t5_2s4ji,False,,usmi,t3_1dc56s
1361936381.0,19b0bo,First time racer,MtnyCptn,26,7,32,"Hello everyone

So I have my first race ever coming up in just over a month. I am 25 and rode recreationally starting two years ago. I'm around 5 foot 7 and 135lbs (I dont know if this information is usefull). This past summer I decided that 2013 would be my year to start racing. During the past summers rides with my club I would ride with my clubs 2nd fastest group and try my best to take my pulls on the front and continue to hang with the pack. Other times I would ride with my clubs fastest group and just try to hang with them instead of taking too many pulls. I didn't have a HR monitor or computer at this time

This past winter I've been riding a trainer indoors a few times a week and seeing a trainer once a month or so. I have ordered The Cyclists Training Bible from my local Chapters but its been about a week and it hasn't come in yet. Most of my training from October to December was just long efforts in zone 2/3 (HR). From January until now my training has been intervals

I will be racing either in a ""Begginer"" category or in the lowest ranked category in Ontario Category 4. Last years speeds of the races I will be racing were between the 33-41km/hr average range and it has me quite worried as I don't know if this will be too fast for me. Can you guys give me any advice on testing my race readiness? I've never competed in any type of racing sport before and I feel like not finishing would be very discouraging and fear putting myself into a situation where I am unlikely to be competitive. 

Thanks for any help you can give!

1336236277.0,t8hpp,I wrote out the story of my first race. thought I would share,jpreston2005,20,4,11,"Three summers ago I was finishing up my bachelors in biology at the Ohio State University. I had just moved back in with my parents after a tumultuous 3 years of living with my friends who were so embroiled within the Columbus drug scene that I was beginning to fear for my life, twenty miles south to the university campus. I started this during the summer and loved it. I was so tired when I came home the first day I lay flat on my bike on the kitchen floor in an attempt to cool off against the tile. 

The next day I could barely walk. But I kept at it. It felt so good, the smell of the beautiful mossy loamy patches of green surrounding ponds that seemed so haphazardly scattered about. That second day I didn't feel so bad when I got home. Then the next day I felt even better. I started timing myself to see how fast I could go. from an hour and a half to an hour fifteen. then down to 1 hour. I was getting faster and it felt so good to be like a normal person. The rush of accomplishment from achieving something, anything, after what seemed so dire a situation just months prior. I wanted more. On the weekends and breaks from school I would find century rides. 100 miles. My first one took 6 hours and I ended up riding with a firefighting father who told me all kinds of tips and tricks for how to pedal efficiently, how to not lose energy, and how to keep a pace. After a while and a few more centuries, someone suggested I race. I had never even considered it before. I eagerly looked up the website they spoke of and found a race was that weekend! 

The race was a ""criterium"" which I later learned was a short, How could I fail? That night I slept the sleep of a man disturbed. no dreams came, only an excited and nervous smile kept vigil over a restless bed. The race began at 9 AM with the beginners, I arrived at 8 in order to register and warm up. 

I talked nervously to fellow racers who were in line at registration which turned out to be a plastic canopy covering an older woman at an equally plastic table. I could see the other racers glistening carbon fiber bikes by their side. I held my old 93' yellow schwinn road bike close, and then moved to the side, whistle in his mouth, staring at his watch. 

The whistle screamed and the ""click-clacking"" of bicycle shoes clipping into their corresponding pedals surrounded me. We started off rather slowly, and another. Soon the pack wasn't picking them up so quickly. I realized I had to follow their lead. With one man up the road, just 100 yards ahead, I slipped out of the pack and charged forward. The difference between riding behind someone and riding into the wind was incredible. I stood on the pedals, caught up to and settled in behind the lead man. I glanced backwards and for a second I thought no one else would join us, but the thought faded as the group slowly but surely reeled us in, except now we were tired. panting for breath. Each gasp of air filled our lungs with cold. The two of us settled back into the protection of a large group and tried to catch our breath the best we could. In seeing our failed attempt, and another few laps passed uneventfully. We were 25 minutes into the race and we started seeing lapped riders appear ahead of us. Old overweight men who decided to try it out on their commuter bikes were being given harsh reminders, as if he had forgotten his own attitude just seconds prior. As we passed the start/finish line we saw the lap cards

I had thought about that tactic myself, it seemed silly now. Most of the group caught up and the aggressive one was now relinquished to be the front man. We followed him for another lap before more attacks were sprung, I was having trouble keeping up with each of them, but we were so close to the finish. 2 laps to go. Another rider went for it and no one responded. The one slight uphill section of the course was the perfect place to attack such a weary group. I doggedly marked him only to find that no one else followed! It was him and I crossing the the line one last time, 1 lap to go. We careened past the cheering crowd as they blew whistles and rang their cowbells. 

We both knew that if we at least wanted to finish 2nd, but now who was going to win? I was still in the lead and we flew up the small hill and turned right. I thought ahead through gasps of air and knew I wanted the inside curve. I could feel him on my right, trying to get in between me and the curb. He wanted to box me out, make me turn wide while he raced home on the final stretch. I couldn't let that happen. I edged right and rode in the gutter, and he was forced to brake slightly and take to my left. I had the inside curve, the race was mine! 

The turn came up and I rubbed my brakes, not slowing, I thought ""the fool, he's not going to be able to make the turn!"" I was wrong. He did make the turn, but what I hadn't counted on was his turn interfering with mine. Going faster, he swung left and dove into the turn, edging past me slightly, but that thought was dashed as quickly as I was. my bike skidded out from underneath me and I came down, packed up my bicycle

My mother anxiously waited in the kitchen and let out a cheer as I walked in. She smiled and asked ""How did it go!?"" I sat down at the table with a half full water bottle, and adorned in my bicycling gear. After a long drink I replied, ""It was great.""",,False,self,t5_2s4ji,,http://www.reddit.com/r/Velo/comments/t8hpp/i_wrote_out_the_story_of_my_first_race_thought_i/

""Where your team for the day isn't your team at all."" - (Quote goes to a teammate after he heard the story)

Sequim overall was way more fun than my Mason Lake run last weekend, and a few other teams brought out some big groups to play around with. Because it was my 2nd race, I had a few personal goals for the day: work on threading forward and back through the pack, work on spotting surges, and finish better than last week at Mason Lake. 

For the first lap I felt awesome - speed was great, and I was able to maneuver my way over to the right or left side of the group where I could wheel up when people were braking needlessly. Sequim had a handful of 90 degree corners at road  junctions and most were staying within the confines of the painted lanes. To keep from hitting the brake shockwave, I was late-apexing corners and using as much of the paved inside as I could to make a better line. Every time I went for the dive I'd jump 5 to 10 people and slot myself up nicely - all very good.

The group kicked up in Lap 2. In a (seemingly solitary) moment of brilliance, but I was laughing on the inside because the leap came so easily. 

Every action has an equal and opposite reaction and this is where I started feeling the lack of base miles and endurance hit. My recoups weren't coming fast enough and (had I more experience) I wouldn't have pushed myself to hold the pace. Having found myself in the front

Ever headstrong - I wasn't going to let it go without a fight. I caught a junior from JLVelo that was struggling and told him to latch on and rotate out, never spending too much time pulling and we caught up with a Motofish rider - up to 4. Hey lookee here, we almost have a decent paceline and BAM, another Bikesale rider and shortly after we soaked up a guy from House Wines as well. I was coaxing and prodding the group along, barking commands to make sure no one ever spent time up front, running in true tank-tread rotation, ""NO SPRINTS!... KEEP THE PACE!"". We weren't running anywhere near enough to catch the peloton, race #1 for a couple of the others. I kept us chatty to keep our minds off the pain that I knew we were all feeling and we were calling each other by jersey since we didn't know each others names. ""House

The junior eventually dropped on a hill and, finishing 6:46 back. The guys awarded me the lead finish of our pack with thanks all around for the work we all did to get us there.

In the crit, he proved incapable in helping me chase down the breakaway of two riders from the same team.

Here's my story:

The .7mile track was on a wide city streets

I got a good warm up in, and seeing them power through the turns made me reconsider my decision to race (only for a moment).  Once I got on the trainer and focused on my warm-up plan, heart rate and liquid intake, my anxiety went way down.  

I couldn't have picked a better spot on the line to start.  I was front row

After about the 3rd lap, but it was surprisingly easy.  

I spent the next several laps ranging from 10th to 20th place.  There were some teams riding, I was pleased with how well people communicated though.  For such a fast cat 5 race, it was a well disciplined group and nobody went down.  

At one point, so I decided to try and move backwards in the pack.  I came out of line expecting to be able to fall back, just as the front of the pack decided to try and make a break.  The pack responded and I wasn't able to fall back in until the end of the pack.  Unfortunately, the guy I was behind let a gap form and I wasn't able to make the jump back up to the pack.  I ended up getting dropped.

It turned out that there wasn't 10 minutes to go, I would have been able to respond to the attack and stay with the pack. That's what I get for ignoring the ""laps left"" sign.  

Even though I was dropped

I just joined my college's team

Your body uses a chemical called ATP to make your muscles contract (as well as a whole bunch of other stuff).  At any given moment, most ATP production comes from the breakdown of sugars.  The most efficient way to do this is to use oxygen in a process called aerobic respiration.  In this process, a single sugar molecule will get you about 36 ATP molecules.  Anaerobic respiration on the other hand, will only get you 4 ATP per sugar, and will produce lactic acid, which as we all know, hurts.  A lot.  Aerobic respiration is much more efficient, and how fast you can get it where it needs to go.  ATP production from anaerobic respiration is practically unlimited in the short term, the force they're capable of delivering to the pedals

As road cyclists (and in particular, so our legs are plenty 'strong' in terms of how much force they have to deliver to the pedals *2.  What we're really working on when we train are the first 2 mechanisms: Aerobic and Anaerobic respiration.  It's a weird way of thinking of it, but at the end of the day, the strongest cyclist is simply the one who is the most efficient at turning food into forward motion.

As long as your body has stored sugar and oxygen

Ok, but the TL;DR is.  **Aerobic respiration is good for sustained efforts below a certain intensity and Anaerobic respiration is necessary for high intensity efforts.**

Here's the part related to training though:  **Aerobic fitness takes longer to gain, the intensity required to get performance gains isn't sustainable over an entire year.  Having pure aerobic periods early, and mostly anaerobic periods later in the season allows you to partially isolate each system, and get faster as a whole.


*1.  Molecular biologists and physiologists will say I'm oversimplifying most if not all of this

*2.  Track sprinting is almost a different sport in this sense.  Sprinters are much more focused on pure force strength than any sort of endurance.

*3 It isn't this simple.  Your body is always using both types of respiration, you've crossed over your LT.",,False,self,t5_2s4ji,False,,

I got to the course a bit early, or form, but after a little while I got more comfortable and settled in.  The pace was brilliant, it wasn't demanding at all.  Then, things started to disintegrate.  I took a corner a bit wide and scared one of the other racers (sounded like he had to jam on his brakes).  I think I also jumped out in front of someone else who was trying to pass me.  Eventually, I found myself towards the front of the group and bolted with a couple guys who went off the front.  I held with them for a bit, then realized I had almost half the race left and fell back to the peloton, someone was passing on the outside of me.  He got a little ahead of me, bounced off the rider next to me

After sliding across the pavement, I half crawled, half lunged off the course and watched the pack whiz by.  Luckily, no one came down with me.  After taking a moment to collect myself, I hopped back on my bike and rode back to the starting line.  I wanted to wait and rejoin the race, but after stopping for a moment I realized that I was bleeding profusely.  The race director and a helpful spectator helped patched me up, and I rode home.

When it was all said and done

Despite the crash, I felt very green and I'm worried I might be a liability.  I guess I'm also just discouraged.  If I can't even finish my first race, how can I expect to make through my second one?

I guess I could use advice.  Should I keep racing?  Is there anything I can do to improve my bike handling skills and keep this from happening again?

I've been riding since I was a kid (mainly mountain biking back then), and became  serious about training last June (more road than mountain, especially lately).  I’m now age 27.

Since June, stopped smoking pot, focused on minimizing fat &amp; simple sugars, maximizing carbs, protein, &amp; vegs in my diet.  I try to eat 4 to 5 small/medium sized meals per day.  Typical training week goes like this:

* Monday (rest)
* Tuesday: intervals - 4 sets of 3 @ 1.5min each
* Wednesday: tempo ride - 2 hours
* Thursday: hills (high intensity) - 1.25 hours
* Friday: recovery ride – 30 to 60 minutes
* Saturday: group ride - 1.75 hours
* Sunday: group ride - 1.75 hours

I always drink a protein + flax + banana + strawberry + water shake and eat some grains after a ride.

For now

I love bicycling, and I'm really pleased with the results so far.  

My question is

Thank you in advance
Mike

Edit: Formatting

Edit 2:  Just want to express my appreciation for all of this advice

* Incorporate some ""Sweet Spot Training""
* Mix up the length of the intervals
* Replace a group ride with a 3 hour ride/do more endurance + distance rides
* Start perioditizing my training
* Do an easy ride
* Read up on the Training Bible
* Save some money for a power meter
* Do some kind of eating during the long rides (still looking into this)

1331096418.0,qlayc,[Review] November Bicycles RFSC 58s Wheelset,mike_burck,15,0,17,"In another thread I mentioned that I have a set of November wheels.  There were a couple of inquiries about how the wheels perform

**About me:** 

I've been riding seriously for only a couple of years and I only recently started racing. Given that

At the same time, and though my skill set may not merit the finest mechanical offerings, I want quality gear.

I'm a college student with a pretty nice job, Williams and mysterious Ebay no-namers and eventually settled on the November RFSC 58s (I'll explain why later).

I guess it's also important to note that I'm 165lbs.  

**The Company**

The reason I went with November over the other value brands was because of their business model and customer service.  I could write 1

[The guys that run it](http://www.novemberbicycles.com/about-us/) have [an excellent business model](http://www.novemberbicycles.com/economics/) that makes a ton of sense to me. Spend some time reading their blog and you'll realize that they're racers who sell products to other racers.  Their ability to communicate frankly and without bullshit really resonated with me.  

If you're at all interested in buying something from them, and they went above and beyond what I expected of them to satisfy my requests.  

They also offer a [nice warranty](http://www.novemberbicycles.com/warranty/)

**[The Wheels](http://www.novemberbicycles.com/rfsc-58s/)**

I ordred my wheels with the 20/24 build and the standard Novatec hubs.  I missed their pre-order, valve extenders (with tool) and brake pads. All new orders also include 3 tubes.  

I built mine up with Bontrager race X-Lite tubes and Michelin Pro Race 4 tires.

The first thing that struck me with the wheels was the stiffness.  I had never ridden deep profile carbon wheels before

The stiffness also makes for excellent handling.  My descending skills have improved immensely since I've been riding my new wheels.  Because they're so responsive

Another thing I love about the Novembers is their weight.  At 1525g for the set

The standard Novatec hubs are quite nimble and have caused no problems as of yet.  Informal ""spin-those-fuckers-and-see-how-long-they-go"" tests indicate that they are, but there's not much to say about hubs besides ""they spin well"".... which they do.  

Like with all carbon wheels (or so I hear), so my opinion might change, but for now I give the brake performance a C.  

Aesthetically, and it makes my ride look extra-ninja-like. 

**Summary**

Pros:

- Great Customer Service
- Super Stiff
- Light Weight 
- Reasonably Priced
- Fast

Cons 

- $900 is *relatively* cheap
- Brake performance is lacking
- Not a lot of flash

We're around 60 guys in Cat D at the start line. The course is 4 x 27 km and totally flat and on many narrow roads, nothing happens. I take notice on the crosswind sections and stay in front (4th-15th pos). 

Second lap is pretty much the same

I realize I don't have the power to make another jump and bridge the gap, but everyone is wasted. I have two options: bridge the gap myself or accept my faith. I try to bridge and go with all I got for 3-4 minutes, but the deal is done. The front group is now 250 meters up ahead and I'm blown.

5 or 6 other guys then join us, but we know they are gone. I win the second group sprint by going out in the wind alone on the opposite side of the road, while everyone is trying to get shelter and find a good wheel to follow, but I'm the first guy to not get points... Fucking fuck.

Here's a pic of second group sprint with me in front (sorry about the quality):

I really don't know how I am planning on structuring this post

I was an elite highschool runner, etc etc. I did this on, what my coach called a lot of ""talent"" and some hardwork. I didn't train as much as my competitors, slacked off a lot and was injured a lot. I didn't accept my scholarships and decided to go division 3, no scholarships not as good of competition.  I did this because i wanted to be with my friends and was scared to go off on my own to a different state, sometimes i regret this decision as I'm in a lot of debt now.  I ran at this school for 1 year, and was injured almost the entire time, because of my injuries.  I quit running july 2011

I sat on my ass, work, school until late june this year when I decided to start riding my bike to work and cancel my car insurance.  My commute was short and easy but I had a good time.  After commuting for a few weeks I thought to myself ""Hmm. Let's ride this bike far.""  I found bikeit, velo, and peloton and was hooked, started riding my dad's steel racing bike from the 80s ""a long ways"" did a half century on a whim one day and it was awesome averaged like 16mph and felt like a fucking badass.  Then I started going into a bike shop a lot, found out they had a weekly ride.  For 10 days after my splurge week (the week I decided to ride my bike a lot

My first group ride was great (July 25th). I showed up in old running tights and a drifit tee shirt. didn't think i'd be the only young person there or the only steel bike rider there, and it was hard. I got through it but it was tough.  Was a 30mile ride at a tougher pace than I was used to, but it was a no drop ride so it wasn't too bad.  

From there I was hooked, I love it.

All of August I spent riding that thing, even 2 crits! Many of you might remember my post [""fucking ducks, my first crit""](http://www.reddit.com/r/Velo/comments/xvage/race_report_first_crit_fucking_duck/) or something like that.  That took place the first week of august.  I didn't even own a kit yet, was still riding in old running tights and running shirt.

I have a kit now. 2 actually. Bibs are pretty great. Wouldn't ever ride without one again.

I guess now that the history is over I'll get onto the main point.

My second crit was the last week of August. I had been riding all month long and felt a lot stronger. It was a cat 4/5 and again had a massive head wind on the home stretch.  Pretty much I led 1/3 of the race alternating the lead with a bunch of other riders all the while the more experienced riders just let a few of us do all the work for them.  No one really knew who I was and they all had confused looks after the race.  I didn't finish well as in turn 3 on the final lap with 200 or 300 ft left my inside pedal hit the ground and I bounced a foot into the air.  Ended up staying up-right but was shocked and scared so I didn't sprint, could I be good at this?""  

The following weeks I really tried to push myself on rides. (I know strava isn't a good measure of ability but it's all I really have to go off of) I was beginning to post times that were right up there with cat 1/2/3 riders in the area. Just this week I took two KOMs from a cat 2 rider i have become friendly with; he works at the LBS I bought my bike at. (I bet him $50 I could take his times in 6 months, and if you do I'll cut your spokes"" (jokingly of course).

So I'm just wondering, not just ""Oh, I wanna go ride that hill today"".

I have just over 1000 miles logged in the 2 months I've been riding. I turned 20 less than a month ago.  Where does my future lie if i keep it up?  What can I do to become the best cyclist I can be?  I've bought the bible, advice, tell me I'm a moron, anything! I'd love to hear from you guys here on velo.

This leaves me with two questions:
1) Do sports-specific products really work better than 'normal' food or was my experience down to ineffective fueling prior to eating the bar?

2) If sports nutrition products are worth it
Some brands I quite like the look of:
Powerbar - favorable experience
SIS - British company (I'd like to support my own country's products) and sponsor lots of cycling teams
High5 - British company and sponsor lots of endurance events.  Seem very popular on wiggle.  Their packaging do make their products seem very low-tech though

**A** Will we be required to register as a team with USA Cycling? (We're all Cat 5) 4 Cat 5 men

**B** Will we be required to register as a corporation to accept money from these local businesses? I've been told we'll need a Tax ID if ~~we want our sponsors to be able to write off their contributions

Thanks!

1332208739.0,r4fj6,Race Report: Tagalongs,ayhsmb,12,1,19,"I feel the need to vent so bear with me:

We rolled out at 6:45am for a 35mi circuit race in a local park and my team showed up deep - eight guys controlling the front for most of the race. We were trading turns following breaks for the first two laps and then one broke right in front of me and not to be a slouch I followed it despite having just pulled the field up to a doomed break. 

The guy who broke away was really strong, putting down ridiculous power and maintaining our gap and this other dude just sat in for a while. Initially, my thoughts were ""it's cool, he just killed himself in no-man's-land trying to bridge, we'll let him rest for a few turns, then we can really solidify this break."" 

After about ten or so leg-crushing pulls on the front of our pitiful little break

Sure, tried to shake him; but nothing worked, he simply refused to do any work. We got him to take the lead only twice, but each time the pace suffered dramatically and we wasted valuable time cajoling him into the wind.

Then, the initiator of the break motions to me that he wants to shake the tagalong. I was nearly cooked but I was game. We both broke away in beautiful harmony. Then we did it again. and again. 

The whole time this tagalong dude was absolutely glued to my wheel

Luckily, a teammate, slaps me hard on the back as he passes and says ""we got 'em."" They caught the other two up the road and managed to stay clear of a field that had forgotten about them entirely.

My teammate ended up getting 4th

I know this is all totally legal in racing and it happens in pro races all the time - where one guy just sits in and snakes the sprint - but I can't not forever think of that guy as a complete and utter scumbag for doing that ""legal"" as it may be. What's your take r/velo? sitting in on a 3 man break for the majority of a race

tl;dr: out on a 3 man break for most of a race with no help from one guy who then sprints onto the podium - cool/uncool?

Reading the other threads it seems the general pace for a cat 4/5 is around 22 mph for the slower rider and around 25-26 mph for the winners. Right now I can ride the same distance as the crit (~12 miles) on a slightly hillier course with an average of 20.7 mph but it doesn't have the corners like the crit course has.

1366636551.0,1cv0cd,(First!) Race Report - Mooresville Challenge (Crit),studentengineer,10,1,16,"First race ever!

4/5 Start was at 10am. I was at the park at 7am to watch the Masters race and get a feel for the track. 1 mi loop; first half is curvy with nice 5-10ft rollers ... then a sharp ~30ft drop with a right hand turn

Did not really do much of a warm up; I rode the course 3 or 4 times early in the morning at Z3 to get a feel for lines.

Lined up and saw a familiar face at the start; a fraternity brother from a different school

The 50 minute crit race started and everyone got up to speed. I settled in the back for a majority of the race behind my fraternity brother and observed everyone else's tactics. I remember looking at the official time every lap we did and thinking ""we're only 12 min in?!"", and figure I can burn my final match here where there is minimal chance of me screwing things up for others. He is falling off the back of the group, so I get next to him and ask him if he wants to grab my wheel and go up the right side. He nods and gets behind me, and I bust my ass and take him up the inside for 3/4 mi and drop him off back in the top 10. My buddy ended up in the top 10; I finished with the group; 25/30. 

Things I learned:

1. I don't know why I put two full bottle waters on my frame for this race; I never even thought of drinking during the 50 minutes.

2. (At least in this race) CAT 5 was not as sketchy as everyone on this forum made it out to be. If anything was even semi risk in terms of movement

3. You can make friends just doing a little small talk in the back of the peloton.

4. The last lap is stupid fast.

5. I need to do more group rides ASAP. Though I was fine being square in the middle of the peloton

6. I could have done a MUCH better job of hiding from the wind

7. It felt really good to sacrifice for others; that is what I enjoy about racing the most so far.

-My current training routes are something like this: I've got a back road route that gets me to Caumsett Park with few traffic lights (For those of you who don't know, there's an 8 mile stretch of road with rolling hills and a large hill in each direction.  The loop at LIU Westbury campus is ~3.5 miles long with rolling hills; it's very safe and relatively close to my home town (in Nassau County). Kissena Velodrome is a 30 minute car ride away (though I haven't invested in track cycling yet) , and there are training crits at Floyd Bennett Field (in Brooklyn~ 45 mins to an hour and 15 mins away) every Tuesday night during the summer. The hill climbs we have around here are 2:30 ~ 4 minutes max (the short hills are very steep while the longer hills are pretty gentle inclines) so, it's hard to get any real climbing in without driving 1.5 hours to Bear Mountain. In other words, there are no real hills to climb, or flats to hammer around my town.

I belong to a medium size club: 50~60 strong, and slow), with about 20 cyclists in each group. I am currently the fastest cyclist in the group (I don't mean to brag; I'm just trying to give an honest overview in hopes that some of you will do the same).

[The podium](http://i.imgur.com/7u5zY.jpg)



**TLDR:**  Shit was hot, the finish was chaotic &amp; painful, and I managed to take 3rd.
 


**Also, but feel free to comment/critique/etc.**
 
 


Bakersfield is really hot.  The Garmin was reading over 100 degrees at the race start and it says the average temperature during the race was 99.4.  But thankfully the heat didn't overwhelm me like it did a few weeks earlier at De Vlees (similar course, another bottle of the icy cold that Sean picked up at the feed for me, and a few extra splashes of water from Sean’s extra water.  Don’t get me wrong though, it was uncomfortably hot out there, just not overwhelmingly hot.
 


In fact, but Sean hung in there like a boss.  He kept a close eye on the front of the group as mini breaks would form and identify whether or not they were a threat.  Small gaps formed on some of the rollers, but Sean brought me right back to the front group’s wheels, always with a smooth consistent tempo to make it easy on my explosive-power-lacking muscles.  I thought for sure I’d set some MMPs for the race on the second lap up the first climb since it felt a bit harder than the first lap, but my 5 minute MMP was on the first lap up the first climb – only 93% of FTP.  Part of that’s the heat – it really saps power out of everyone’s body.  Part of that’s the beauty of sitting in the pack with a domestique who knows when to chase and when it's safe to sit in.
 


The group was mostly together after the turnaround on lap one (Eat some Gu, keep on Sean’s wheel), but shortly after, Tommy (a friend &amp; cyclist with a reputation for his incredible power) managed to build up about 30 seconds off the front.  On one of the mini climbs after the turn around, it looked like Sean was approaching explosion zone, but those bad asses from Die Hard (the original, of course) correctly cut the red wire, guts intact.  On the way back to the feed zone Sean decided the best risk/reward at the feed zone would be for each of us to grab one bottle of the icy cold.  Sean gave his bottle to me.  The plan went off without a hitch.
 

Oh right, there was a solid 10-15 person pace line going and it wasn’t long until we had Tommy back with us.  Sean relieved himself of his domestique duty and received an honorable discharge, having done everything I could have asked of him and even things I didn’t know I needed (like to not risk grabbing two separate bottles at the feed).  At this point there were probably about 25 people in the front group out of the 85 who started the race.
 


So the rollers out to the turnaround were pretty uneventful.  A few minor attacks were quickly brought back without gaining more than 5 seconds (Eat some Gu, but everyone knows what he’s capable of, so that was shut down pretty quickly.  We mostly soft pedaled on the flat approaching the final kicker &amp; finish line.  I made sure I stayed near the front with shelter from the cross wind. 
 


2 minutes from the line, but surely it’s bluffing (No legs, you’re not cramping, you’re pedaling, so shut up and pedal!).  35 seconds at 575 watts later (HR is 196), I’m one wheel behind Tommy (Jim is on Tommy’s wheel) and dear god I’m in a world of hurt as I start to fade.  Tommy seems gassed and so does Jim.  I sit behind Jim for another 15 seconds at 315 watts [HR is 197].  **“HERE THEY COME HERE THEY COME THEY’RE COMING AROUND ON THE LEFT THEY’RE SPRINTING!”** shouts someone behind me.   Two guys wiz by me.  I pull around Jim as my legs are begging for me to stop the pain and my heart &amp; lungs are overwhelmed with oxygen debt (something something financial Armageddon, bailout, so much so

1332601463.0,rbfle,Race Report - Not having much luck!,ductions,9,0,16,"*WALL OF TEXT INITIATED. Scroll down for tl;dr!*

[Last week I wrote about my first race of the year](http://www.reddit.com/r/Velo/comments/r23ub/race_report_first_of_the_year/) . The week leading up to it all I could think about were things that could go wrong. Which didn’t really help my nerves. That race started ok

Today I had my first proper criterium race at Victoria Park in Leamington Spa and compared to the lead up to my first race I hardly thought about it during the week and was relatively calm. I’d even go as far as to say I was feeling pretty confident

Andy, not something I’d want to experience at the start of a race. I then joined Andy riding around the course to get a feel for it. Very smooth and very fast. Also a lot of carbon!

At 9:30 we lined up ready to start. By now the adrenaline and nerves had set in, and I felt confident enough to move up and to the side without feeling like I’m going to kill someone. I think maybe I did get shouted at once for going a little wide on a corner, but I like to think this is part of the learning experience.

As the course was basically an oval there were no sharp corners

Fitness wise I felt great, but didn’t want to risk it - maybe next time. 

When the final lap bell rang, and was keeping up fine. People started moving up (or more accurately, overtaking me) coming out of the first corner. I’ve read many times that there is no point sprinting to finish in a race like this if you aren’t in the top 10. And it makes sense, you’re not going to win anything and will probably cause a crash.

But that is what happened next. Coming to the last “tight” corner I heard shouts and a loud pop, but as it was such a sudden stop I went right over my handlebars, narrowly avoiding a tree and landing head first on the grass (not the first time this has happened!). I’m not entirely sure what had happened in front of me, but I’m really glad I hadn’t caused the crash. I lay on the ground for a bit, and the St. Johns guys made sure I was ok. I sat up to see [Andy bloody faced](http://yfrog.com/ketlrtcj) being treated on the track. He lost half a tooth and split his chin open. 

So frustrating as it was the last corner with the finish line in sight. As I hit my head I decided not to take part in the second race of the day, Andy and his friend.

Video (of race and crash) is uploading on youtube right now.


(I appologise if I have accidently any words - I’m probably concussed or something)

**PICS**

[My Steed and I](http://i.imgur.com/j2bKZK7.jpg)

[With My Competition](http://i.imgur.com/rChZbjt.jpg)



Just came back from my first road race at CAT 5, icy and 6th month long Winter this week in Minnesota.

**Temperature in the 70s, had a little  trouble clipping in so I had to up the pace a little bit to get back on the tail end of the peloton.  Now in the back I'm finally able to get a chance to get a feel for the group flow.  Moved up a couple positions.  Man are we moving fast, and holy shit does this feel easy!  We were going probably 25-30mph (Didn't have time this morning to install my computer) but it really felt like a very easy, leisurely warmup pace despite how fast we were actually going. It was almost mesmerizing, the unified hum of many hubs and tires on the asphalt. Lots of yelling, mostly ""HOLE!"" and ""SLOWING!"" (Winters here in Minnesota are very harsh on the roads causing many a large cracks and potholes).  Couple close calls of guys slamming on their brakes. After some long miles of straightaways, there were of course 90 degree turns for the next 5 mile straight away and hills


**About 15 miles in** or so I couldn't find a safe opening, I yell chain myself, move to the right and slow down as I go into a shifting frenzy trying to get the chain to latch on.  Finally got my chain to latch back on but the peloton was already 30-40 meters away. Of course I sprinted after them to catch the rear but it seemed they were very eager to drop a man while hes down.  


**Now dropped**, me and this fellow in a Motobecane kept Yo-Yoing.  He'd catch up to me, I'd break away, then I had to stop and readjust my bars again and he would pass me, I'd catch up again and leave him a half mile back, Stopped for a pee break, he'd catch up again


**Eventually** two different breakaways of women passed us, I LOOOOVE descending as fast as I can but this was outright **sketchy as fuck** with my tire like this **I** and my handlebars like this **/**. There were some pretty long, steep hills towards the end too, which weren't really much of a problem except my legs literally locking/freezing up on the final hill on the last lap. I completed the race though, that's what matters.


**My Excuse** for not thoroughly checking the bike on a long ride as soon as I got it back from the overhaul at the LBS is that it was snowing and freezing rain thundersnowing all the past few weeks here in MN and didn't want to get all the salt on my clean ride I just got back from the shop.  As soon as I got back home from the race I went in to the shop and chewed them out for doing a sloppy job on my ride


**Couple Things I learned**

* **1.)** If you want something done right

* **2.)** Thoroughly inspect your ride before the race.. To paraphrase Muhammad Ali

* **2.)** I'm a much stronger climber than I previously thought (At my 5'8""

* **3.)** I need to improve my leg strength and sprint endurance to make sure I can catch the peloton if that happens again.  Not really an issue since I'm naturally a very fast sprinter and endurance was my ultimate weakness so I've been primarily working on my base for one year now.

* **4** I can confidently say I'm too much engine for my wet noodle of a frame of a 1974 Raleigh.  Will be using my much stiffer and lighter [2004 KHS Flite 500](http://i.imgur.com/U6P91v1.jpg) from now on.

* **5.)** A lot of people throw a LOT of money into this sport.

Firstly is it worth getting Ultegra over 105 hubs? The price difference is about £15.

Secondly what lacing pattern should be used on a front wheel used for racing and training? Does it matter? I weigh around 68kg

Of course, can't afford it and I'd miss the data gathered from my powertap. 

UPDATE: I ordered an Open Pro, I couldn't bring myself to spend an extra £20 on Ultegra hubs. I went for radial spokes, as this is what I have on my other front wheels.

I typically don't have a problem with going 'hard enough' on my 'hard' days.  I ride with a few guys who can legitimately destroy me.  All I need to do is say 'put the hurt on me today' and they're more than happy to do it.  The training benefit of this is, I find myself in the situation of riding 2-3 hours at 'tempo' pace on Monday, then going out and getting my head hammered off on Tuesday, then going out to my local group ride on Wednesday and barely being able to hang on, even though I *should* be the guy putting the hurt on most of that group.

Then Thursday I'll rest or just commute

OK, 2 days of VO2Max work, plus a couple long rides, plus some other stuff... I just wonder how they're fitting it all in without getting totally destroyed and compromising basically all of those workouts.   I've got a good base from years of long-distance triathlon.

1307730126.0,hwkin,First Crit Race. Featuring Stats/Story for those thinking about going out for the first time.,orwell,9,1,12,"Hi:

I did my first race the other weekend. Thought I would post the stats for those who were in my shoes and thinking about racing but worried about it (if there are any).

Here are my exports:
http://connect.garmin.com/activity/91412447 (has heart rate)
http://app.strava.com/rides/707790

I messed up my start time and missed resetting the lap timer until 4 min into the race. So

Race was in Folsom, in a business park - 30 minute total. 

I was worried about racing for a bit, riding in a large group (generally the corning part). 

I've owned a road bike for about 4 years

I started ""training"" about 1.5 months ago, also triathlons are expensive!

**Race run-down**: My goal was not to get dropped. It was my first race (cat5). I got there, when they asked who've raced before, I was pretty much the only one who didn't raise my hand. A fair amount of older guys who looked pretty prof. and seemed like they raced a 1-2 cat5s a yr (if that ) to avoid moving up :P 

Starting out, the lack of wind resistence in the middle of the pack was more than I was expecting. I ended up leading for about 5 laps throughout the race. Wasn't my intention, I just followed someone moving up front and ended up in the front. With 5 laps to go, a team sprinted ahead of me and I decided to conserve as the pack wrapped around me -- thinking, I will conserve for 2-3 laps, then make a move... Well, I ride pretty conservatively, I was like fuck-me; I cannot do anything but I've got all this energy left. The finish was right after a decently sharp right turn

My heart rate monitor said I was ""working"" hard, I wasn't winded or sore.

I would like to make a dynamic leaderboard on our sidebar displaying our best racers.  Problem is, etc.  Does anyone have any ideas as far as a formula or rubric for ranking?

Okay guys

BrainInAJar would like weighted values for our 5 categories

I'm thinking we'll assign points for the top 10 places

One idea Hellvis and I have thrown around is running three categories, and C.  A = 1/2, B = 3, C = 4/5.  We'll have podiums for top three racers in each category.

From johnybutts: 
The scoreboard should be based from 25 pts for 1st place down to 1 point for 26th place.

It should be category independent - after all a win for a cat 5 feels just as good as a win for a cat 1.

We should separate road, and Mtb though.

If y'all feel like those in more southern climbs will race more and therefore have an advantage

I think a mid-season upgrade should also be worth 25 points. And it'd be worth defining the season as Jan 1 through Dec. 31 for road/track/mtb

Anyways

I'll be compiling this based on the race results page

I came mainly to learn a lot; as long as I wouldn't crash I'd be happy. For the first 20 minutes or so I managed to keep up with the main peloton, a guy from my club who was riding  behind me even tried to pace me back, but I didn't manage to catch up anymore. The rest of the race I just tried to keep going at a good tempo, got picked up by 3 others who I rode a few laps with, then the group grew to 8 or 9 and that's how we finished. We got lapped by the main field on the penultimate lap, but I didn't really mind because a club mate was out on an attack with 1 other :). (He didn't manage to keep away though.)

So that's a recap of today

- I tried to follow the ideal line

- The tactic I tried to follow is that if most people around me held there legs still for 10 seconds or so (which seemed to happen when an attack got caught)

EDIT: 1 more question I just remembered:

- Having been lurking on this sub for a while I've learned that you should keep pedalling as much as possible in curves.

Thanks a lot!  I have been a lurker for a while but will start contributing to this community.



Back story (optional reading):
I got into running when I was 17 and trained by myself for a few years and got quite competitive without really being very scientific with

I picked up a bad case of trochanteric bursitis and didn't really do much rehab and took a year to get over it.  I came back super motivated and did some incredible base training to the point where running 95 miles per week 'was so easy' according to my training diary.  I also really educated myself of endurance/running training and adopted team sky's principals of marginal gains and trained with the mind set if I want to be a pro I got to act like a pro, used compression, foam rollers, core workouts, recovery products.

All going well then a medical nightmare happened.  Long-story short

At that time I had an undiagnosed atrial septal defect

This blood clot in my leg traveled up to my heart and went through the hole and then up to my brain.  This caused a stroke.  I lost use of my left arm and could not use my mouth properly. I also had delayed reactions.  After being in hospital for two weeks

I trained for a bout 7 months since then but kept getting constant minor injuries (hamstrings

But I have recently decided to ditch running and take up cycling.  I feel like I have sacrificed to much of my life to running and had nothing in return.  I find cycling more fun and running just reminds me of how good I should be by now if it was not for injuries and health issues.",self,t5_2s4ji,1371412796.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/Velo/comments/1ggydl/former_runner_now_cyclist_has_some_questions_plus/

My preferred type of cycling is track however I am essentially on standby for our team's upcoming road series so I will be doing training for distance too. The keto diet worked for me because there were simple rules as to what macro nutrients I should consume - low carb

Now it seems I need an unknown number of carbs, presumably the same amount of protein and an unknown portion size.

I'm currently ~225lbs and would love to get close to 200lbs.

The reason I ask is my physical therapist says my pedal stroke is quad dominated (i.e. the majority of my force occurs during the down stroke and I slack off during the pull back &amp; lift up) and in his experience many of the cyclists he treats for [patella femoral pain syndrome](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patellofemoral_pain_syndrome) and to some extent, stretching, &amp; foam rolling, but I trust that part of the rehabilitation process)

I'll start I guess.  Last year I didn't do any base training, I had tapered too much and lost a lot of fitness.  So I got advice from some athletes and made a new schedule which included racing a lot...  I got slowly better, but I was still lacking the endurance emphasis since I could make good attacks and sprint, but couldn't keep up on hills or keep the pace in breakaways.
