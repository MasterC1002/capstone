We're playing with a rookie QB and a rookie RB starting. We suffered several huge injuries both before this game and during this game. We had no right stepping into the Giants stadium and putting up a fight.

But we did. The Redskins gave the NYG one hell of a battle. We converted on numerous 4th downs. RG3 showed incredible athleticism and heart

Hold your heads high, keep your hopes up, and keep on routing as hard as you can for the Washington Redskins.

But I don't want to add to the negativity.

So you know he'll truly ball out then, and this season he'll do what he can help Rob Jackson or whoever else is filling his role.  He's a true team player and a true Redskin.

**Final Edit:** That's that!  Those who've won the passes have been notified.  If you've received no word either way

IMPORTANT: If you've received a pass, and we could re-purpose your pass for them.

IF YOU DID NOT WIN A PASS:  As I mention above, Maryland, and Virginia assemble in Richmond to watch our boys tune up to defend their NFC East Championship title.  I'll be mingling with both groups, and I'd love to meet the people I've been chatting with for almost 2 years. :)

___________________

Also, Fred Smoot has announced he will be joining us for the meetup! Your own FredSmoot21, a former Redskins great will be in attendance for camp on Wednesday, and he might bring a +1 who you'd also be interested in meeting. Please, whether you've been awarded a pass or not, come on down and make your presence felt. This is going to be a blast!

Hello

I know what you're thinking.  ""Ramses, subscribers, several months ago, Reddit founder (and our burgundy and gold brother) /u/kn0thing approached the Redskins social media team, inviting them to host AMAs in /r/redskins, /r/nfl, and /r/ama.  The same social media team he talked to has reached out to /r/redskins again, THAT'S why.  The passes will get you much closer to the team, right?

So here's the deal.  The meetup is for EVERYONE who has/can get that Wednesday off.  Come on down and show your support for the team, surround yourself with fellow fans, and get psyched for the new season.  It might be tricky, but I'd love to get us all in one spot at least for a bit to get a huge group pic.  If you're going to play hookie from work, do not pose for the group pic.

If you want to throw your name in the hat for the VIP access passes, we will select at random who will receive the passes.

* Camp facility info: http://www.redskins.com/news-and-events/training-camp/index.html

* Parking and visitors tips from WaPo: http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/football-insider/wp/2013/07/24/redskins-training-camp-in-richmond-if-youre-going/

* Some common sense stuff: Check the weather (disposable ponchos cost nothing and you won't regret having one), bring water and snacks if you don't plan to budget for concessions, and lawn chairs if you want a place to sit. Practice is at 12:40, but get there EARLY if you want to find a good spot.  D.C. to Richmond is 1.5 to 2.5 hours depending on our state's oh-so-predictable traffic.

Please feel free to use this thread to ask questions, PLEASE share your experiences and make suggestions on meeting spots, parking, or any information you think is useful.  That's about it.  We'll see you guys a week from tomorrow. **HAIL!**


**EDIT:**

Answering a couple of commonly asked questions.  We will be making the selections on Friday afternoon

We've also gotten a lot of requests from people who'd like more than one pass, but we can't have people loading the proverbial ballot box.",,False,self,t5_2r4wc,1376087321.0,old,

It isn't easy to write this.  Hearing your name as our new kicker, but maybe somewhere deep down, hope....

I won't pretend to know you. But, Shh. Don't speak. Let me finish.  I know we both have pasts. I've run around with kickers in the past. Sure it often started great, seeming like this was it. I had finally found someone who could do what needed be done to get that ball between the uprights, the uprights of my heart.  But it always quickly soured.  And it hurts.  This time it was easier. A month ago the name Cundiff was on my heart, and it made me smile. But I quickly learned that my latest infatuation wasn't kicking the ball, only kicking me in my balls. Metaphorically of course.

And I realize you have a past as well Kai Forbath.  Had always heard good things about you, maybe, occasionally you could throw in a 50+ yarder?  To help me learn to love again, to feel complete again.

Please Kai

Love
A Redskin Fan.

I've been obsessed with RG's knee. With figuring out why, because we care about the team and that dude's future.

**Q: General Question: What was your ""Welcome to the NFL"" moment?**

A: It took me to the facility after I got drafted, the cold tanks they had in the league were the ones that we had in high school. It was my welcome to the NFL moment - you might not all have the best equipment but you have to make it work. - RGIII

--
**Q: Addressed to anyone... Do you think college players should receive some kind of financial compensation for their work

A: That's a whole issue on it's own. Not every sport makes money for their school, they should be paid. -RGIII

--
**Q: General question: 1) What's your favorite video game? 2) If you weren't a football player

A: My favorite video game is Assassins Creed and NCAA and Madden. Truthfull if I wasn't a football player

--
**Q: General question: Who is the one current player (collegiate or professional) that you would not want to line up against?**

A: If it was just me and another guy on the field by ourselves

--
**Q: To anybody- Who was the player you looked up to as a role model as a child?**

A: Michael Jordan. - RGIII

--
**Q: What's the most frustrating thing about playing football professionally; interpret that however you would like.**

A: You're provided with a stage to help people and inspire people

--
**Q: General Question-When looking at your journey to the heisman and the nfl

A: I think every athlete has to work for it. Everyone's going to be blessed with some natural talent, height, weight - but it's how you harness and use that talent is what counts. -RGIII

--
**Q: General Question: What was it like to shake the hands of all the previous winners when you won the Heisman trophy? Any memorable remaks from the former winners?**

A: They all told me welcome to the family. It's a moment that not everyone gets to participate it. I really take it to the heart and will never forget it. -RGIII

--
**Q: To all: Favorite NFL stadium to play in? Least favorite?**

A: Favorite: Fedex Field

--
**Q: To anyone: what was it like walking onto the field for the first time as a starter?**

A: A dream come true. Turn your dreams into reality and you go out there to play with the best of the best. It's what you live for. -RGIII

--
**Q: Who was your funniest teammate?**

A: Chris C. last year. -RGIII

--
**Q: To all- What is your favorite memory from your high school football days?**

A: Growing up with the guys that you played with

--
**Q: RG3

A: Super Bowl

--
**Q: RG3

A: Just not forgetting what I did to get me where I am. Just cause you're at the next level doesn't mean you don't stop doing the things you did at the lower levels. -RGIII

--
**Q: RG3

A: I''m wearing some bright neon socks with a nice design on the back. -RGIII

--
**Q: What other sport would you want to play if it wasn't football?**

A: Basketball

Now my family (mainly my father) is a Skins family through and through, it has your name on it!"" I would always roll my eyes and say something to the tune of ""That's his last name Mom...blah blah blah...angst."" One day I decided to watch a Redskins game in full, first time I had done this, and I made sure to pay attention to the guy with my not technically correct name on his jersey.  

Long story short, that I had to stay glued to the TV. No matter what the score I'd stay in front of that set, his raw talent could change the game (see that crazy Dallas game with the kick block, you know the one). I finally saw what people got from football, watching men perform feats that we could only dream of and, by playing with friends, trying to emulate such feats.  

I haven't missed a game since that day and I'd like to thank Mr. Taylor for that gift. Rest in peace.

I am STUNNED by the ""fire Shanny, *finally* has management that abstains from what we've been bitching about for 13 years.  They didn't trade youth for expensive has-beens that'll move jerseys.  They converted currency into quality draft picks.  They've replaced prima donnas with captains and team players.  They've begun to address both lines.  THE LINES!

Fire them!?  We've been floundering for this long precisely because we've had a revolving door of coaches who don't stay long enough to get the team walking in one direction.  No cohesive vision, kid) learning a new offense every six minutes.  **Fun fact:** Since Snyder bought the team in '99, exactly ONE head coach has had longer than 2 years before getting yanked.  One.  His name was Joe Gibbs, and despite the fact that (Hogs forgive me) his mind for the game was not exactly compatible with the new NFL, HE STILL TOOK US TO THE PLAYOFFS TWICE IN 4 YEARS.  That is what a stable environment can do, even for a team built by Danny and Vinny!

We got shut out last week, but because there was no good move to be made in free agency or the draft.  We couldn't hit on Newton, and everyone else was a question mark.  People rave about Dalton, but forget that he didn't come packaged with A.J. Green.  Gabbert, Ponder, Locker, Mallet, **especially** with knowledge of the next year's depth of talent at QB.

Hasslebeck's getting very old, and I'm thrilled we didn't make it.

I know the offensive unit looks like a bunch of monkey poo at the moment, and saying, “OMG WTF IT’S EVEN WORSE THAN WHEN I BROUGHT IT IN!!!1!”  We finally have some grownups running the show, and if they’re as efficient and productive with FA and draft acquisitions next year as they were this year, we might not be dominant, but expect to see some fireworks.  For now, stay strong.  Don’t be Dannys.  I’m out.

1365170199.0,1bqdps,I'm more excited for next season than I am for Breaking Bad. Here are a couple reasons for why you should be also.,jkangg,47,1,34,"1. Our star QB is coming off of a terrible injury and sudden departure from the playoffs and will be exponentially motivated to show the world that he can play at a high level without getting injured.

2. We have the Sex Cannon back, just one.

3. Garcon's foot injury should be fully healed. He's the Redskins best receiver, speedy and makes sick catches like [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AxPvFAY6hj4). We also get to see Fred Davis tear it up after missing the second half of the season. I know he's not a media darling or mature to a certain standard, but he brings a level of physicality that the Redskins severely need in the receiving corps. This guy is a straight up bull. Also, he did say he's going to make every other single team that didn't sign him pay, so it goes without saying that he's going to be motivated. 

4. Adam Carriker and Brian Orakpo are back! Rob Jackson, Rob Jackson tricking the shit out of QB's, intercepting them then licking their tears, Ryan Kerrigan snatching his own tipped balls then running them back for TD's, and Perry Riley bringing physicality and making tackles out of nowhere we have one of the most versatile and balanced, no, I think we have the BEST 3-4 in the league. Chris Neild too!

5. One of the major reasons why our secondary allowed so many big plays last year is because we had no hard-hitting safeties to punish deep routes. [Brandon Meriweather](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hfPEjI1cKkc) really has a knack for finding the ball

6. We don't have many draft picks. You might ask why I say this excites me, Kirk Cousins. Went from rebuilding mode, 4-12 to NFC East Champions and we kept all our rookies. Tell me one team that drafted better than us, just one. With less rookies coming in to the team, the coaches and the players get to focus more on refinement and building team chemistry and less on teaching/mentoring rookies(not to mention more cap space). Guys, for the first time in more than five years, we aren't in rebuilding mode anymore. We don't need to rely on the draft for hope anymore

7. This is the best Redskins team I have seen since 1991. 

Edit:

We get to play elite playoff contenders like the Packers, but these games are going to show us what the Redskins are made of.

P.S. Can we get a countdown in our sidebar for when we get to see our Skins play again? I CAN'T FUCKING 
WAIT!

**EDIT: Some very bitter and pathetic individuals are down-voting comments so show them how it's really done by UP-VOTING comments like crazy! Just because you don't have parade doesn't mean you have to rain on ours. And please fellow Skins-fans

We're posting early to get in on all the pre-game chatter! If you're at the game

The Redskins are coming off seven straight wins including a huge victory at home which sealed the NFC EAST division title and knocked off The Dallas Cowboys from playoff contention. Now they'll host the red-hot Seattle Seahawks who come roaring into the playoffs as one of the most feared teams in the NFC. 

Arguably the two best rookie QB's will lead their respective teams into battle. This should be an intensely competitive brawl as both of these amazing young talents want it bad and are good enough to get it done

I've wandered over into ""enemy territory"" to see what the reaction was to our new found loss of cap space.  While I'm not happy about the cap hit the one heartening thing I've found is that the Redskins fans seem to be just as belligerent about this situation as the Cowboys fans are (and rightfully so).  What upsets me the most about this whole situation is the timing of it. If we (Cowboys, I can deal with the consequences. Even the fact that other teams may have taken advantage and aren't getting punished, fine, I can deal with that too. But to enact the punishment 24 hours before free-agency begins is absolute crap. This could honestly ruin free agency and even the draft for both teams.  The way I see it is even if legal action is taken and the teams are successful, it will already be too late. The high impact free agents that both teams will need their cap room for will be signed and off the market. The damage will done.  Anything done retroactively will almost be another slap in the face as we can't go back and re-resign free agents.  The NFL knows what its doing and anything after the fact will be like the asshole who cuts in front of you in line and then says, ""OH!? Were you waiting here? Sorry!""


As an outsider looking in I don't know nearly enough about the Redskins to make deeply informed comments but from what I see the team was headed in the right direction.  It was a lot of picks to give up although realistically the team only lost 3.  However, and athleticism.  In addition, with the cap room the Redskins had the team seemed poised to throw all sorts of money at big name WR(s) and possibly additional OL help to reboot the offense.  However, now that the cap space has been cut I'm wondering what you think the Redskins will do to adjust to this crapy situation.  Does the team follow through and finalize the trade for the #2 overall or do you rescind your offer and account for the lack of cap space? 


As a couple asides, I can't help but wonder that if the Cowboys and Redskins have to deal with this kind of asshole behavior from the league for paying players ON the books, what the hell is the league going to do to the Saints for paying players off the books?

1366833157.0,1d14pt,Shanahan's draft history and who we could pick for our RT spot,AlcoholicZebra,39,3,15,"We know that Shanahan loves his athletic lineman

Going back to 2004 (so the past 9 drafts), and 6 of the 9 Guards or Centers have had an agility score of 12.29 or lower.  Josh LeRibeus got that 12.29.

* Ryan Clady - 11.8

* Selvish Capers - 11.95

* Trent Williams - 11.96

* Tom Compton - 12.19

* Ryan Harris - 12.3

NFL Average for an OT's agility score - 12.51 (lower is better)

If we consider Ryan Harris to be the absolute slowest Shanny is willing to draft at OT

* Lane Johnson - 11.83

* David Quessenberry - 11.94

* Eric Fisher - 12.03

* Tanner Hawkinson - 12.03

* Justin Pugh - 12.08

* Luke Joeckel - 12.08

* Braden Brown - 12.13

* Vinston Painter - 12.27

* Reid Fragel - 12.3

Guys just outside of the cutoff at 12.34 are Nick Becton and Terron Armstead (why not

So let's seperate these prospects by draft estimates and ignore the 3 guys that are probably going in the Top 10 picks.  We can now ballpark in what round Shanny might draft a RT depending on whose still available.  Some guys are sort of in-between rounds

**Round 2:**

Terron Armstead

Justin Pugh

**Round 3:**

Justin Pugh

David Quessenberry

**Round 4:**

David Quessenberry

Vinston Painter

Reid Fragel

**Round 5:**

Vinston Painter

**Round 6:**

Nick Becton

**Round 7:**

2. Gear - bring something to get signed, but virtually no chance of autographs. If you are going to the standing areas by the sidelines, bring a blanket to sit on instead.

3. Bring your kids! The guy in charge of running the training camp is all about getting kids involved with the Skins. There is a kids zone that is going great from everything I’ve heard. There is a special viewing area at the far endzone for kids only, which is amazing.

4. Be prepared for heat and yelling! Things get hot with the sun beating down and having very little space to yourself

Cowboys:

* Good.  Their o-line looks bad.  The Tackles looked average and the Guards and Center looked worse.

* Good.  Murray couldn't do much until the Giants d-line completely wore down.

* Good.  Romo struggled when the pocket collapsed

* Bad.  Romo's still Romo

* Bad.  Their defense looked very good.  The corners are far improved from last season

* Bad.  Dez Bryant turned it up a notch

Giants:

* Good.  Their Tackles looked atrocious in both run blocking and pass blocking.  Their Guards were also struggling

* Good. Wilson has fumble-itis

* Good.  We can expect Cruz to rebound from his drops issues

* Good.  Their secondary blew.  They had to use Justin Tryon a fair amount, but then again maybe that's just because Dez Bryant looked nasty with how he set up his routes.  Coe was meh.  They really need Amukamara back.  And the injury to the other corner, Thomas hurts them.

* Good.  Osi and Tuck weren't a factor.  Their d-line started hot but wore down heavily as the game went on.  Marvin Austin and Chris Canty might be back by the time we play them though.

* Good.  Their linebackers were not good in coverage.  On Ogletree's first TD, but one of the linebackers should have been deep mid.  Instead, they were all about 5-10 yards in front of the end zone, meaning Ogletree was gifted an easy opportunity to get behind them, which any WR in the league should be able to do.

* Bad.  JPP looks even more like an animal.

* Bad.  Cruz won't drop those passes again

* Bad.  Before Keith Rivers got hurt

1345516430.0,yk5es,"Griffin, Cousins, and expectations.",RamsesToo,31,18, and as usual I am compelled to chime in with my positions to counteract the media's ""crazy."" And if this is anything like last year many of you will chime in to counteract MY ""crazy

First, he's looked more poised in the pocket than Griffin has.  As everyone has pointed out, this is due in great part to the fact that he was playing the Bears 2nd and 3rd team defenders.  Cousins would have looked a lot less cool with Lance Briggs and Julius Peppers breathing down his neck.  I believe he also looks more comfortable than Griff for the same reason Andrew Luck does.  What both of them are doing now in the NFL is a LOT closer to what was asked of them in college than what was asked of Griffin.  Griff spent a whole lot of his time at Baylor taking snaps from shotgun rather than taking the ball from under center and dropping back.  Luck, Cousins, and others are simply enhancing skills they have been cultivating for years, while Griffin is picking them up from scratch.  Cousins might actually be more ""NFL ready"" than Griff based on the kind of offenses they ran, but of course the ceiling on Griffin is about a mile higher than the one on Cousins.  I'm MORE than happy to see Cousins flourish in the background.  We'll either have a suitable backup for years to come, preseason games

The second insane thing is the idea that Griffin has taken a step back in this second game.  Whaaa?  He hasn't taken a step back, and realistically, he's not going to look as good as Cam Newton did making them.  Griffin is extremely rough around the edges right now, and this year is about sanding those edges down.  Once he's relearned his role as a QB, THEN we'll be able to exploit his usefulness as a dual threat.

That second one is my favorite kind of prediction.  I either look like the calm, but screw you, buddy, my QB is doing totally awesome right now; you can't even hurt my feelings. Anyway, good luck to us all in the coming season.  Hail!",,False,t5_2r4wc,True

The Redskins are red hot after three straight division wins but still need to make up some ground in the playoff race. They'll look to do just that against a Ravens team hobbled by injuries and suspect on the road. The Redskins need this one to keep pressure on the New York Giants in the NFC EAST division race as well as stay relevant in the wild-card discussion.

I thought this couldn't be right.  I must have made some silly game choices

You guys still came out on top.

Let's look at the Cowboys.  They're playing subpar and they have been all year.  I've watched a lot of of their games and they just don't finish games.  They play a stretch of tough games @Bengals, at worst you guys split the series.  

To the Giants.  Because of 07 and last year the media seems to love the idea that the Giants will strengthen up in their last few games

This won't happen this year.  Their schedule it too tough.  In fact

Best case they go 9-7, you'd still have the advantage.

Best scenario for you guys, but I have Giants with the same range (9-7 to 8-8) and if you guys take care of business against them you guys have the tiebreaker advantage.  I believe the Cowboys will at best be 8-8 and most likely worse.

Practice starts at 12:40 PM, and you want to be there BEFORE that.  If you live in D.C., Maryland, or NoVA and you leave after 8 AM, you are BEGGING to have a bad spot on the sideline or miss the beginning of practice entirely.  I'm going to be on the road at 7.  Get up and get going!

You also need a poncho.  There are disposable ones you can get from the supermarket.  They're dirt cheap

If you don't want to budget for concessions and drinks, I believe.


* For those who did NOT win VIP passes:

I've done extensive scouting and asked a lot of questions, pass or no pass, you can identify yourself as being a part of this meetup, which will help us all to connect and gather up.  I really do want this event to be bigger than the very generous giveaway the team extended to us.  I will post a meetup thread on Wednesday morning to serve as a way for people to organize.  ""I'm on the left side of the far end zone, get at me!"" etc.

* For those who did win a VIP pass.

You need to pick yours up at the social media tent.  When entering the facility, gathering up should be much easier.
