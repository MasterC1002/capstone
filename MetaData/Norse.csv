1. The night before the Winter Solstice (December 20th most years, the driver of the sun chariot, undertakes her darkest ride, leaving the world without her light for the longest night of the year.
The Ancient Germanic and Norse people would typically light a Yule log, as the Solstice dawns.

If you don't have a fireplace or cannot get a log (and let's face it, if not outside, at least close to a window where Sunna can see it.  Even if you are not a literal believer in gods and goddesses (like myself), this is the proper way to honor our ancestors' traditions.

2. After Mother's Night, each day grows brighter than the last, and even in our modern age of electric heating and lighting, that is cause for celebration.

Some years you may choose to spend Yule in a cabin with only a fire to warm you, so that you could one day have the better life you have now.

Some things to do during Yule:

* Sit around and have some meaningful discussions with the people close to you.  The internet and Reddit will still be here when Yule is over

* Put up a tree.  The ""Christmas Tree"" originally had nothing to do with Christmas whatsoever.  Our Germanic and Norse ancestors were decorating evergreens during Yule long before the Christians showed up.  In the Old Tradition, knowing that they are unwittingly supporting the spurned beliefs of their ancestors as well.

* Drink some hot

* Give and receive gifts.  This is another tradition that predates Christianity among our ancestors.  The ancient Norse and Germanic culture highly valued the idea of ""A Gift for a Gift

* If you would like, even if you don't literally believe in supernatural forces.  And if you do, that's great.  With how little we really know about the universe, you might even be right.

I hope you find these tips helpful!  Feel free to add your own!

HAPPY YULE!

I want to establish a very large ""commune, but land is very cheap, and I'd be buying a pretty vast quantity - say, a minimum of 3000 acres (1220 hectares.) The difference between this project and the others currently around is that this project would aim at being inhabited year-round, and more or less self-sufficient. As far as I know, the present establishments don't grow their own food, and typically are only inhabited in the summer months. 

I'm thinking I would rather manage this all privately, without concessions to modernity. I would imagine having to go through some sort of organization would result in increased regulation (constructing houses to building codes, health and safety regulations relating to the slaughter of animals, and so on) which as far as I'm concerned would undermine the point of the project.

I imagine how I would do this is by buying up vast quantities of land and then allowing people to rent from me. Perhaps they would initially pay for the privilege of the use of the land, labor for me, and so on.) This whole operation would of course be a vast money-drain, but I thought I could offset these costs by offering tours of the place, charging for a chance to live on the commune for a week to ""Experience Viking Daily Life!,"" and selling handwork and crafts. (I would imagine selling produce would be difficult, due to the fact that there's unlikely to be much to spare - after all, submitting to food safety inspectors and so on.)

In addition to offering a chance to understand more practical matters - farming, or see how proficient people might become in medieval military skills when in an environment where seriously training for two hours a day is a possibility. 

Obviously any such project would be quite a ways in the future. At the moment I'm still in my undergraduate studies, or anyone with knowledge of law, nonprofit organization or anything else like this could offer advice on the organizational aspects of such a project.

Finally (and at the moment this is of course purely hypothetical, build a house, and establish a working farm. After the land is fairly well developed, it would be easier for newcomers to get involved - they might have the option of taking over the farm of someone moving on, or join an established household as a hired hand (during the *fardagar,* of course.) In exchange for the backbreaking labor, we'd come away with a truly unrivaled appreciation of daily life in the Norse era.

Thanks

One morning mighty Thor woke to find that his hammer, but none of them had, and became quite upset to hear that Mjollnir was missing. Mjollnir was the most powerful weapon that the gods posessed, and if their enemies heard that Mjollnir was missing then they might attack, and the gods would be powerless against them. Loki, the trickster god, had an idea about who had stolen Mjollnir, the king of the giants. When Loki found Thrym, was made his bride. Loki flew off to tell the gods the bad news. They debated and argued, dressed as a bride

Averøya is a small Island close to the capital of the region, and were reliable places to live due to usable soil, and amazing fishing opportunities, which was obviously what the communities of that time were living of.

Why would they make *one* day for just one Roman deity?  
  
* Sun's day  
* Moon's day  
* Tyr's day  
* Odin's day  
* Thor's day

Ymir is formed from the clash of fire and ice from Muspelheim and Nifelheim. The cold molecular cloud that our solar system began in formed in the cold (Nifelheim) of empty space (Ginnungagap) and from the remnants of an exploding star gone supernova (Muspelheim). Ymir was not alone. Also created was a cow named Audhumla. Ymir drank of her milk to sustain himself. The cold molecular cloud eventually collapsed inward and then forced gas out into a protoplanetary disc. The core then ""fed"" off this disc of gas and debris to form a protostar. Ymir was then killed by the other Gods. His remains were used to create the *nine* worlds. The protostar eventually became our Sun. The debris it threw out into its disc collided and accumulated into the *nine* planets.

Another interesting parallel is the story of Surtr. It is said that Surtr will one day rise from Muspelheim brandishing a flaming sword, possibly engulfing the Earth in the process, before becoming a White Dwarf. It's interesting to parallel. They had nine worlds in a tree called Yggdrasil. We have nine planets in our solar system.

Another one is about Thor. ""Thor"" is from Germanic languages and ultimately means ""thunder"". Thor married Sif

The halls Thor (thunder) resides in are called Bilskirner (lightning). These halls are located within Thrudhvangr which can be translated as ""power field"". The Earth's upper atmosphere (where Thor is depicted, electrically charged and the Earth's electromagnetic field does help protect it from things outside of it. Thor's hammer, Mjorlnir, can be translated to ""crusher"" or ""grinder"" which is precisely what space rocks do when they enter the Earth's atmosphere. They are pulverized.

Not a creature was stirring
And I in my armor
Was drunker than anyone else in the Realm.

I staggered upstairs and fell into bed
While four quarts of mead were ablaze in my head.
Then up from below came the sounds of a brawl
So I grabbed up my axe and ran down to the Hall.

I missed the last step and crashed down in a heap
Thinking
When what to my wondering eyes should appear
But two brawny strangers

I said to myself
Then I noticed ten warriors laid out at their feet.
I gave out a yell and leapt into the fray...
I'll always regret my poor choice of that day.

For the one laid his hammer to the side of my nose
And up
Then came a lone frightened voice from the floor
""Those are no mortal warriors -- that's Odin and Thor!""

Then they looked at each other and they said
Now they know who we are
Then Thor raised his hammer
And with a loud crash

I crawled through the Hall and flung open the door
Not really sure that I'd seen them before.
The snow bathed in starlight
I saw them ride off on an eight-legged steed.

And I heard them exclaim

Weren't they just a bunch of rapers and pillagers? Looters and defilers?"" Never have I heard such a powerful lie. Upon delving into this culture

Let me preface the following with the acknowledgement that I'm an atheist. I do not believe in the Nordic Gods, so that this post isn't a giant wall of text, the Nine Noble Virtues and the acceptance of mortality are the two pinnacles of their ideology that I really love. The way H. R. Ellis Davidson puts it:
""In spite of this awareness of fate, men writ large, who led dangerous, individualistic lives, yet at the same time were part of a closely-knit small group, with a firm sense of values and certain intense loyalties. They would give up their lives rather than surrender these values, but they would fight on as long as they could, and they did not demand that they should. We find in the myths no sense of bitterness at the harshness or unfairness of life, and the wonders of life are matters for thankfulness

The second big thing I love about the Vikings is their love for words, pillaged and burned many Christian churches, and the literature and records they held. This very well may be true, but they had an understanding of how powerful and lasting words can be. By passing down stories from generation to generation, you implicitly create the only thing we humans can make everlasting, the reality of our reputation. Its the only thing left behind when we die. And since they knew that every man is mortal, they did all they could for kin and country to be immortalized in skaldic poetry and stories. The following two quotes, sum up exactly what I'm talking about.
""More than their warrior image and wide-ranging conquests, their sense of beauty, and their powerful drive to explore the world in search of a better place to live, and prosper. The worldwide and sustained fascination for the Vikings endures. Thousands of companies, products, sports teams, and even space probes bear the name Viking. It is a badge of honor; a symbol of conquest and exploration. The best of the Viking Spirit sails on.""

1315170970.0,k4ojz,Hello. I'm an author in need of wisdom from fellow Norsophiles. ,jon819,11,0,10,"I am currently writing a series of eight novels which deal heavily with the mythology of Norse Paganism. Each book contains three or four story arcs

So, detailing long bloodlines, great heroes, fantastic events, etc. If I were to force myself to include all of this lore most readers would become bored, as there would be no pages left to actually build my story and my own characters. Therefore, simplification is necessary. 

My question: At what point would simplification annoy you

Example: The cast of Asgard, I need to cut this down to about thirty, at most (since the Midgard arcs will have thirty or forty unique characters, also). Do you think that I should take several paragraphs to explain why these characters are no longer around, or should I simply not mention them? I'm tempted to do the former...but this would mean conjuring a war or a conflict of some sort; another act which may annoy Norsophiles rather than placate them.

I'd love to hear your thoughts.

As you can see April this year was our busiest month so far

Our userbase is nearly at 2000 so i'm thinking that when we get to that putting a little '2k' in the logo or something

I'm hoping that we'll reach 2k users by christmas eve or by looking at the progression of uniques we can assume it will be last day of the year which would make for a nice end to 2012. Also looking at Thor 2 to be bringing in some new users who want to learn so when they do be nice to them.

Besides the stats we can look towards maybe adding some new bits for Winter on /r/Norse so if anyone has any background images to submit go right ahead for that

But what books should I get? I'm primarily looking for books that actually tell their stories and not just list interesting facts about them. Something to dive in and where I can lose myself in the stories. But accurate enough that I can be sure I'm not just reading an interpretation of the Norse Mythology by some Author.

I researched a little myself and apparently the Prose Edda is a very important book about the Norse Mythology.

Thirdly

I know this is a bit far fetched, if we were to assume that both stories were non-historical and entirely mythological or apocryphal, it is reasonable to assume that the author of Egil's Saga (in my mind, Snorri Sturluson, who also compiled the Prose Edda, which speaks of the Trojan War) had a working knowledge of Ancient Greek literature

69. No man lacks everything, one in abundant wealth, one in his good works.
70. It is better to live
71. The halt can ride on horseback
72. A son is better
73. Two are adversaries: the tongue is the bane of the head: under every cloak I expect a hand. 
74. At night is joyful he who is sure of travelling entertainment. A ship's yards are short. Variable is an autumn night. Many are the weather's changes in five days
75. He only knows not who knows nothing
76. Cattle die
77. Cattle die,—judgment on each one dead.
78. Full storehouses I saw at Dives' sons': now bear they the beggar's staff. Such are riches; as is the twinkling of an eye: of friends they are most fickle.
79. A foolish man, but wisdom never: he goes on more and more arrogant.
80. Then 'tis made manifest, which the great powers invented, and the great talker painted, that he had best hold silence.
81. At eve the day is to be praised, a maid after she is married, ice after it has passed away, beer after it is drunk.
82. In the wind one should hew wood, but a shield is for protection, a sword for striking, but a damsel for a kiss.
83. By the fire one should drink beer, but a dog at the farm.
84. In a maiden's words no one should place faith
85. In a creaking bow, a chattering crow, a grunting swine, a rootless tree, a waxing wave, a boiling kettle,
86. A flying dart, a coiled serpent, a woman's bed-talk, or a broken sword, a bear's play, or a royal child,
87. A sick calf, a corpse newly slain, a serene sky, a laughing lord, a barking dog, and a harlot's grief.
88. An early sown field let no one trust, each of which is doubtful.
89. A brother's murderer, an over-swift horse, a horse is useless, if a leg be broken, no man is so confiding as to trust any of these.
90. Such is the love of women, on slippery ice, a spirited two-years old and unbroken horse; or as in a raging storm a helmless ship is beaten; or as if the halt were set to catch a reindeer in the thawing fell.
91. Openly I now speak
92. Fair shall speak
93. At love should no one ever wonder in another: a beauteous countenance oft captivates the wise
94. Let no one wonder at another's folly
95. The mind only knows what lies near the heart
96. That I experienced
97. Billing's lass on her couch I found, if not with that form to live.
98. ""Yet nearer eve must thou, if thou wilt talk the maiden over; all will be disastrous, unless we alone are privy to such misdeed.""
99. I returned
100. When next I came the bold warriors were all awake
101. But at the approach of morn
102. Many a fair maiden, when that discreet maiden I strove to seduce: contumely of every kind that wily girl heaped upon me; nor of that damsel gained I aught.
103. At home let a man be cheerful, he must often talk on good.
104. Fimbulfambi he is called who' little has to say: such is the nature of the simple.

A few notes: Merrill is declined on the same pattern as Egill (Agli) as a joke. I'm not sure if I'm better off tacking on a nominative case terminal -r on the names Lars and Erin or just leaving them be - is there a standard practice for dealing with foreign names in modern Icelandic?

Standing strong against the storm

Mighty Thor watches for the giants 

As he spots the giants Thor sounds his great horn

With the sun glinting off the giants tridents

They make an easy target for Thor’s heave

Mjolnir streaks across the field lightning flying all around

Cutting through swathes of giants before they could even breathe

Nothing can stop Thor’s ceaseless pound

The giants swarm all around Thor

Hoping to get the lucky strike

But Thor just swings his hammer and causes it to rain and pour

Crushing blow that smash head

Lightning strikes from the sky as Mjolnir begins its toil

And then Odin’s answering call

Odin charges forth on Sleipnir’s proud back

Gungnir pointed down and onward

Soon there are no more giants threatening Asgaards monumental walls

Odin and Thor take a moment to revel in their glory

The sun sets over the mountains standing ever tall

They reflect over the giants plan and make their way to the mead halls

Thor returns to his home ready to embrace his wife

Sif

Although Thor might be lord of his fief 

Sif will always remind him of his humility.

Secondly, like Hedeby? For that matter, was the Viking-age city situated exactly where the modern city is? I ask because I'm curious whether the surrounding geography would have been the same.

A few other points - were there dedicated priests in Norse territories? I don't really recall any popping up in the sagas outside of England and other Christianized areas. It would really help to convey the theme of Scandinavia's Christianization if I could have a fellow in vestments present alongside Olaf. Also, as did many other Germanic leaders, but I'm wondering about the Norse particularly. The fact that you have towns like Sigtuna filled to the brim with churches constructed by the kings supports such a link, but I'm not finding anything hard and fast.

Did the Christianized Norse tend to display crucifixes and the like? The only one I've been able to find is the famous example from Birka. Again

1359716433.0,17otcy,Are there any similarities from the norse myths to the society today? Reasons/examples to explain the different things in the society. (example in the text),guakelerotk,2,2,0,"The oxford dictionary defines myth like this: 
&gt;a traditional story

Can you easily look at similarities from the norse myths
An example; Skades and Njords marriage is why people want to have cabins both in the mountains and with the sea. 

Skade and Njord are both different; Skade grew up with the high mountains with wolf howls
Neither of them liked the others environment
This can be an ""example"" of why people want to go to the ocean when the summer approaches

It can also have a deaper meaning; it shows how hard it is durng a marriage to free ourself from our childhood enviroment. You sometimes have to move away to a strange place/family. 
Some often longs after their 'childhood landscape'; the sounds and smells

Is there any other similarities we can find within the norse myths/stories? Reasons/examples for why the society is like it is today.
