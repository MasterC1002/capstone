We all know the demographics of reddit and this sub pretty well. There are a lot of students and young professionals here. With the summer approaching, there are also a lot of people that are looking for employment. I thought I'd take a few minutes to try and help. Below you will find a few of my major tips for junior or mid positions (senior positions are harder to generalize). I am also committing to answer any question submitted in the next 24 hours (AMAA). Some of the tips may seem a little obvious but I promise you these are all very common mistakes I see during the application/interview process.

About me:

I've been in the industry over 10 years. Prior to that I was in IT for another 10. I wont give too much away about my company

Tips:

* If you REALLY want a job
* The online application is extremely important. When I have to go through 100 applicants for one job, previous salary, etc) I may never make it to your resume.
* If you're out of state
* Be honest about your expected salary or don't put anything at all. This is my second disqualifier. Most people are humbled when they first enter the job market thanks to universities inflating their salary expectation. Don't let your inflated expectations cost you the job interview.
* Don't give me your GPA unless it's 3.75+ or it's 100 percent required on the application (which I doubt). We have an optional text field for GPA on our application and most people will write down there 2.X GPA.
* Try to fit in! If you make it to the interview stage
* If you haven't touched ArcMap in a while, I have to question if it's because you haven't been on the bike in a while or if you simply don't know how.
* If something is important enough for me to list in the job description as a ""desired"", you should at least figure out what it is and why my company might be using it.
* When i asked why you left your previous position, including my company. Don't tell me you can't work with them. I good general answer is ""I couldn't see a future there"", unless you're a habitual job hopper because then I know you're BS'ing anyways.
* I'm sure I'll think of a few more tips and I'll add them as I think of them.

Now it's your turn. Ask away. I'll try to answer as many questions as I can through Tuesday evening. On Wednesday I leave on a business trip for a few days so I'll cut it off then.",self,t5_2qmpb,1368588072.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/gis/comments/1e8n8k/gis_hiring_manager_amaa_and_tips/

I don't think people are really doing themselves a favour by not trying to problem solve these themselves.  If you are really wanting to work in GIS you are going to need these problem solving skills and be able to work through problems.

I've always been fascinated by maps, very cursory knowledge of programming languages like Java and Flash--of computers, and a friend recently suggested I look into GIS.  Naturally, the first place I looked was Wikipedia, followed by checking to see if a sub-reddit for GIS existed.  Lucky for me, it does.  I was hoping to find some basic information about what exactly GIS is, but I found nothing in the sidebar but related sub-reddits.

So, but I'm not even clear on what the applied difference is in those certifications--basically, what is the difference between regular GIS and geospatial intelligence?

Essentially

- What do you wish someone had told you about GIS before you embarked in a career in the field? 
- How would you explain your job to an elementary school student?  

Also

I very much appreciate any information you guys can share!

**Edit:** THANK YOU for all of the incredible insight.  I really didn't expect to get so much quality, to now having a fairly good understanding of what it is, and where to start looking to learn even more--exactly what I was looking for.

I have to do a Masters Thesis in GIS and I thought I'd pick your brains. My thesis has to make a hypothesis or ask a question in a spatial context.

As an example, predict, and explain observed spatial patterns of Culicoides species at the national scale”. He spent a good deal of his thesis explaining such background technologies as the Internet, PostGreSQL, Mapfish, etc, and another good deal of his thesis explaining bluetongue. Only part of it was actual GIS.

Any suggestions?

So it looks like there are three main areas that I'm seeing as important to most of y'all:

1) CPU speed: Given the fact that ArcGIS is apparently not coded to take advantage of multi-core processors or multi-threading

*Corollary*: A really high-end GPU may not make much difference at all.  I had considered the possibility that a machine marketed as a ""gaming computer"" might be a nice off-the-shelf option

2) Memory: Obvious

3) SSD: This is something I had not anticipated, end up being the real bottleneck.

I'm a little afraid of how much some of the machines you guys are using cost, it may be that I have no choice.

- C++ interface.
- Comprehensive coordinate system database. The software will be used worldwide
- 2D coordinate conversion. Vertical datums are largely optional for our application.
- Mature API.

I loved every minute of it and then I took another technical elective course which is called ""Introduction to Remote Sensing"", loved the subject more.    

I was not a bright student because of my lack of interest, thermodynamics etc., so the instructors in my department did not know me well.    

I have applied master's program in our department and got accepted. This was a shock for me

And she called me yesterday and told me that she had a project which will begin in September and she choose me as her assistant, ArcGIS and Matlab really well. (I don't know anything about Matlab, but I have an intermediate knowledge about C..) Because during the project (the project is for 2 years) I will handle the GIS related workload of other assistant, who is a doctorate student. She told me that there were many candidates for this position that she gave me, who are much more informed and experienced about GIS but she choose me for my ambition and told me that she trusted me in this project.

1) How are career prospects looking in the field right now? How likely is it that a new college graduate with no employment experience in the field can pick up a job relatively quickly?

",7,20,http://www.reddit.com/r/gis/comments/10rkwr/gis_for_anything_other_than_oil_gas_energy/,"so i was exposed to GIS as an environmental tool mainly for forecasting the future and spatial analysis.  I have always thought that this limited the scope of where GIS could be useful.  I know some businesses use it for planning and obviously the real estate industry relies heavily on GIS, but I'm wondering if there is demand out there for small, private or public, and am only really finding GIS jobs in those specific industries, organized by custom attributes. i.e. types of practice, etc.? or how about a site suitability map of best colleges to attend when planning in high school
So, defense, or energy industry?
Have you seen demand for GIS anywhere else? or do you see any place currently without demand where GIS could be useful? 

EDIT: i should clarify...i guess what I'm wondering is if there are just straight up GIS professionals, rather than the current state of GIS which i have found to just be a tool that is  useful in many industries rather than an industry all its own.
overall, I'd like to find a way to get paid while working with GIS, but i seem completely unappealing to most hiring companies. I have some experience, both academic and professional, but my degree is in environmental studies. any suggestions?

A little background: At my work we have a small GIS department (3 people) and our current process is to create file geodatabases for each client. The main issue is that we work in a high-transaction environment and we are constantly locking each other when we work on the same project. This is extremely annoying so we're trying to move to a relational database like PostgreSQL.

While it would be nice to switch over to SDE ESRI Canada gave us a quote that is way too much for a staff of three people (something like 40k install and 20k/year maintenance)

1. User adds article to [wheretogoscouting.org](http://wheretogoscouting.org/)
2. User adds one or more geotag (via the {{coord}} template
3. Some piece of software (perhaps written by me) scrapes the databases for {{coord}}-tagged articles, for example) or on the server.
4. Users will then be able to use the KMZ file and Google Maps or Google Earth (or any other KMZ-aware application) to find locations in the wiki that are geographically near to them, etc.

Some notes on the KMZ file:

* The wiki will make extensive use of categories
* Each point in the KMZ file would have
* All objects will initially be point objects, which would exist alongside points marking trail shelters and parking areas.
* I will probably offer a NetworkLink implementation to ensure that users always have the latest data. I will also off a full ""static"" release.
* I will implement KML regions, having all of the items on-screen at one time is visually cluttered and bogs down Google Earth on my 27"" iMac.

A bit of background about myself:

I'm currently enrolled in a small university in my home town (lucky, an independently operated GIS firm that works under the university's name.  I've worked there full time as a GIS tech for about a year and a half - figured it wouldn't hurt to get my foot in the door with some applicable experience while I'm still in school.

As far as experience, am teaching myself Python and have fooled around a bit with Postgres to set up the SDE.  I've used open-source software like BASINS, CAMEO and MARPLOT, and have experience with hydro software like AquaChem and Modflow.

Now

Eventually, I definitely need a break from school.  My boss has promised me a temp position once I do have the degrees, but I don't think it would hurt to see what other opportunities are out there for me.

For the professionals that have been in the industry for a while, my first ""big boy"" job out of school - I haven't ever had to make a resume before, I'm hoping for a little input so that I might have a bit of an edge.

Also

Thanks to anyone who decides to indulge me.

Today we tried a small test using the LAS to Multipoint tool, and, when compared with a basemap, kind of inaccurate (it was picking up houses and buildings in addition to trees).

1) Are we going about this the right way? Should we even be using this slate of tools for what we're trying to do?

2) We found the point spacing with the point file information tool. For our test ground layer we entered the point spacing at 5.22

3) There seems to be another program called Fusion that also processes raw LIDAR. Is this is a better route that just bringing it in with ArcMap?

4) In the LAS to Multipoint tool, for canopy data, we tried entering 3, 4, 5 for low, medium and high vegetation, but we were confused as to what output to select.

I found [this paper][1] about low-cost orthorectification and it almost makes sense. I understand the basic premise: use some feature-detection algorithm to generate feature matches among all the images. On some test images I think I've generated enough to not even require hand-designated feature matches

Initially I was going to create a homography between each image pair-wise (since each image is processed in order and there is overlap) but I realize that this is known as ""rubber-sheeting"" and is an easy way to create awful discontinuities.

The paper recommends bundle adjustment for the camera parameters of each photo. In theory, I just ... don't know what the algorithm for this would be. It may be that it's late, and it may be that I just need to let it stew for a little while, but I thought I'd ask this here anyway.

It is roughly 100 Maps

EDIT: I have found the solution to the problem. Maybe if anyone else is confronted with this, at least for GeoTIFFs, which is the case for me. For example: In 9.3. the reference shows as expected and is set the UTM32N. In ArcGIS 10.1 however, the very same GeoTIFF and the very same projection is identified as WGS84 Geographic Coordinate System. Hence there is some sort of unexplainable offset and distortion. The same goes with any other projection I had (ETRS_1987, Germany_Zone_3 etc). All of them are falsely interpretated. Thus when opening these GeoTIFFs in ArcGIS10 alongside some Vectordata stored in Geodatabases, there can be huge offsets.

I'm about to graduate with a BA in Geography and minors in GIS and Planning from a college in New Jersey. I'd really like to find a job related to one or both of my minors. But one of my problems is that, have barely any programming experience, and am just not overall a great student even in my non-GIS classes. Obviously, I'm not going to get a job right out of college and I'll be lucky to land an internship that would give me the required experience to get a job anyway. It's tough finding work in general, but in my case I have to start looking at other post-undergrad options.

I don't know if getting a Masters is right for me, since most of my non-minor classes were based on human geography and I did well on the Praxis II for social studies (although this would not be nearly as rewarding financially as GIS).

Could I please get some opinions on those options and some ideas for more options? It would really be helpful. Thank you so much!

Somebody please just help me understand why things are the way they are, or help me have an equal fighting chance to land a job! NETWORK is KEY in the line of work I earned my degree in, so what better way is there than to contact the people of reddit!?  ",,self,,

Currently we just use a projector and I make bookmarks in ArcMap.  Then during the meeting, aerials and the site loaded up.  Then someone will make notes and try and get back to me with what edits they want.  This is aggravating since most peoples notes are crap.  

So what I'm looking for is something that I can create and editable feature class for the meeting and have people draw their edits or something to that effect along with being more interactive for the less computer literate.
