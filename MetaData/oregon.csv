The Constitutional Amendments:

**Measure 77: Catastrophic Disaster Amendment**

*  Authorizes the governor to declare a catastrophic disaster and bring legislators into session. Authorizes suspending specified constitutional spending restrictions.

**Measure 78: Government Branches Amendment**

Summary: The proposed measure changes the terminology in the state Constitution for the three state government branches. Makes grammatical and spelling changes. 


**Measure 79: Real Estate Transfer Tax Amendment** 

* Result of ""Yes"" Vote: ""Yes"" vote prohibits state/local governments from imposing taxes, except those operative December 31, 2009.

* Result of ""No"" Vote: ""No"" vote retains existing law prohibiting local governments from imposing real estate transfer taxes/fees (with exceptions)

Summary: Amends constitution. Current statutory law prohibits a city, or other political subdivision or municipal corporation from imposing taxes or fees on the transfer of real estate (with certain exceptions). However, the state legislature has the authority, subject to Governor approval, to impose such taxes and fees or to change current statutory law. Measure prohibits the state and any city, county, district, fees, 2009. 

**Measure 82: Privately-Owned Casinos Amendment** (side note: Measure 83 is related to Measure 82 and even if Measure 83 passes it is not valid unless Measure 82 is passed) 

* Result of ""Yes"" Vote: ""Yes"" vote amends state constitution to authorize privately-owned casinos; requires such casinos to give percentage of monthly revenue to State Lottery for specified purposes.

* Result of ""No"" Vote: ""No"" vote maintains the current state of the law

Summary: Amends constitution. Currently, provided that the particular operation is approved through initiative law. If the privately-owned casino is to be located within an incorporated city, city electors must also approve casino location. The privately-owned casino shall pay 25% of adjusted gross revenues each month to a fund created by law for the purposes of fostering job growth, educational achievement, vibrant local communities, protecting and improving natural environment, and supporting all federally recognized Indian tribes in Oregon. Amendment does not prohibit operation of privately-owned casino within 60-mile radius of existing tribal casino operating on reservation land. 

**Measure 85: Corporate Tax ""Kicker"" Funds for Education**

* Result of ""Yes"" Vote: ""Yes"" vote allocates the corporate income and excise tax ""kicker"" refund to the General Fund to provide additional funding for K through 12 public education.

* Result of ""No"" Vote: ""No"" vote retains existing corporate income and excise tax ""kicker"" that requires refund to corporations when revenue exceeds estimated collections by two percent or more. 

Summary: Amends constitution. Before each biennium, social services other state-funded programs/services. Current law requires an automatic ""kicker"" refund of corporate income and excise tax revenue when that revenue exceeds estimated collections by two percent or more. Measure allocates the corporate income and excise tax ""kicker"" refund to the General Fund to provide additional funding for K through 12 public education. Measure does not change the constitutional personal income tax ""kicker"" provision that requires a refund to individual taxpayers when personal income tax revenue exceeds estimated revenue by two percent or more.

Fine of 375$ + Police Fees (average 800$) per violation.  What causes a violation?  Many things

A noise violation is any sound that can be heard at a 40 decibel level on the street after 10pm (for reference 30 decibels is whisper quiet and 60 decibels is normal conversation level).

Littering can be as few as 1 item of trash on your front lawn.

Which means virtually every house party is in violation

What's more is that after 4 violations at the same address (not even by the same tenant) will cause a fine against the property owner.  Property owners are not allowed to evict tenants based on their violation of this ordinance and even if they could

Which means there are only 2 ways for property owners to protect themselves: Do not rent to students or charge higher rent to make up for possible expenses.  With both fewer places to be rented for students (lower supply,False,self,t5_2qhjg,False,,,t3_19ngpg

---


My girlfriend and I are coming all the way from Sweden this summer for a “See the USA” trip that will include NYC, and a roadtrip section to take us from Portland down to San Francisco. We have been doing homework for the trip for quite some time, but of course there are still questions, so I’m wondering if you guys would help us out?

This is obviously a once-in-a-lifetime thing for us

Here are our questions:

1.	We’re arriving in Portland on a Saturday morning


2.	The coastal route wins over inland, with such an abundance of sights and scenery, plus it takes us right down among the Redwoods in California?


3.	The classic question: Any secret tips for what to see? We have done a lot of googling and are aware of the Undersea Gardens, and we plan to keep our eyes open for surprise signposts along the road as well. Anything we still might miss, and really shouldn’t?

4.	How lucky would we need to get to see whales off season? Can we find out somehow if any have been spotted once we're there?

5.	Should we be pre-booking places to stay? On earlier US trips I’ve always been able to find a bed at random roadside hotels and motels

6.	All those national forests and such along the coast are just too many to google – can you guys tell us some favorites for some light hiking stops?

7. We keep reading about ""tide pools""

If you want some extra info on us: We are a regular m/f couple, although GF has never been to the US before (I have, several times, but not to the west coast). We have a decent budget for the trip. We are nature lovers, but also of course like all the usual travel stuff, such as museums, great restaurants, so no Portland breweries or more than fairly light hiking. We are also not into huge crowds or motorsports.

A big thanks to anyone who wants to help us!",self,t5_2qhjg,1367913216.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/oregon/comments/1dtgum/coming_5000_miles_to_see_your_fair_land_a_few/

The problem is that because of the distance and financial considerations, so we want to hear which cities/towns you all would recommend!

To help narrow it down a little bit, VT, and we love both of those cities. We've heard that Corvallis matches up favorably with them in population size and being a college town, but are worried that the job market there might be too small. Our current leaning is towards Eugene, but that's just based on gut reaction and not really on hard facts. Other places like Albany, Bend, and Salem have had their names come up but we don't know a lot about the pros and cons for those areas. We love nature and camping and hiking. My girlfriend wants to find a job where she can help people and make a positive impact on a community

We would love to get any and all input for places to live, and things to do. Also, if you think we're crazy to  just up and move to Oregon you can tell us that too. All input is welcome!

Thank you so much future neighbors!

I grew up in Southern California for 25 years, the pretentious Hollywood crowd, the severe poverty and rampant crime, and the terrible lack of a natural environment. The smog alone stole 20 years off of my life expectancy, I'm pretty sure.

I moved up to Reno NV through a series of choices about five years ago. It's nice, the extremely fast paced lifestyle, and the sheer California-ness of it all changed my mind. I then realized if I got up the coast, I will be closer to forests, still in driving distance of Seattle and San Francisco, and able to finally visit Vancouver. So I'm kind of thinking Oregon is the place. It looks like Eugene works perfectly.

Ok, but I won't hold my breath. I'm a mythology obsessed non-religious person, wife is a classic Pagan. I am looking to major in Anthropology and Linguistics for my Bachelor's degree, as well as a fascination in Japanese and French. I'm a very open minded, easy going, pacifistic, full of wonder person. My wife and I will be raising a child

I've seen that [Faireworlds](http://www.faerieworlds.com/) and the [OCF](http://www.oregoncountryfair.org/) are both in Eugene. I've also heard there's a lot of very organic food

Any advice?

Inside the car the interior lights are on (they stay on for 30 seconds) and my night vision is ruined. As soon as I close the door I can't hear anything either. I am lit up like a Christmas tree and I have no idea what's outside my car or what it's doing.

At this point I think about starting the car and getting out of there, like a dog but deeper and throatier.

Finally my lights turn off and I can see a little. And there's nothing out there. It's already gone. I leave, or what.

* At this time

The ""Vote Yes on Measure 79"" campaign is simply fear mongering about the possibility of State government imposing a tax that does not yet exist (and already prohibited at certain levels of government). Nor does it repeal the transfer tax that is currently in place in Washington County!  The signs imply that a real estate transfer tax is going to be implemented by our State government if we don't amend our constitution. I think we should be careful when it comes to amending our state constitution.

Hey all! I previously posted in r/Portland and was directed to hit up this subreddit considering you would all be from all over Oregon instead of one area. (I'm moving from Chicago. I want to get away from the city feel and frigid ice pick winter.)

That thread brought me information about cities, I'll list so no one has to read the entire last thread or repeat themselves.

**Cities:**

* Corvallis - great food

* Forst Grove - Small town

* Eugene - College town, town/community feel 

* Bend - Beautiful

* Rogue Valley - pot capitol, activities, diverse group of people

* Coast - depressing/old people

* Grant's Pass - small town

* Cave Junction - same as Grant's

* Ashland - Hippie Mecca

* Cottage Grove - not much info

* Roseburg - not much info

* Vernonia or Amity - 1950s or 1970s feel

* Mt. Hood - gorgeous

* Mcminnville - beautiful 

* Silverton - 45 mins away from Portland

* Beaverton - not nature

* Hillsboro - not much info 

I was told to watch Dead Man - Johnny Depp to get the feel for Oregon's winters. And to learn the lingo/jargon before I arrive so I'm pronouncing Oregon correctly. =P 

I'm trying to learn about the job market, activities. 

Pretty much any highlight

I am planning on looking into a few colleges while I'm there to finish my BA but that won't happen until I've lived there at least a year and gotten a feel for the area and figured out where I can go to school. 


Thanks in advance for all of the help! I appreciate it tremendously.

I decided to do some reasearch. I know what to expect with the weather, dirty hippies who can't stay out of others business. I've heard people are lazy, have no work ethic and that money wise the place is rather underwhelming/dying. Also I've read about everyone being miserable and unwelcoming. Also about the bums and just the general suckiness of alot of things there, including many restaurants and even the Rose Festival. And also how it's a place where hipsters and artists go to die.

I just really want an honest opinion. Personally I LIKE the fact people there give a shit about the earth. Hippy or no. The concept of no cell phone use while driving AND no smoking. That is fine, including a certain few meters from entrances. And talking on your cell while driving is completely illegal there. And the Oregon nature is right up my alley. I live for nature.
 I'm also an artist (digital)

**TLDR;
I've heard Oregon has terrible people (miserable, everyone lacks work ethic so expect to have shitty service everywhere, it's the place where hipsters and artists go to die, and how pretty much the whole place sucks. :/
Honest opinions please?**",self,t5_2qhjg,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/oregon/comments/1hyzq9/moving_to_oregon_from_az_heard_some_really/

* Someplace that has a fair amount of sun. Not necessarily beach weather all year long but at least some sunshine would be nice.

* My  mother hates the big city feelings but my grandmother wants a place where she can walk to the stores/markets/book stores and still retain a level of independence. Shes fairly healthy so a 20 minute walk would be cake for her.

* It'd be really wonderful if someone knew of a place kinda near Portland so we could visit often.

* My mom works in medical billing
