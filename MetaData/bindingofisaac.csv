1357158487.0,15udyy,Binding of Isaac Mechanics Guide,Chiraa,193,30,91,"Here's the work I've done on an ongoing guide for all sorts of gameplay mechanics in The Binding of Isaac:

https://gist.github.com/4419061

It's still very undeveloped

**My favorite notes**

* Character damage is a multiplier
* There is no damage cap
* Brimstone works amazingly with The Inner Eye (total x9 damage)
* The way that pills are randomly selected is quite interesting
* Despite popular belief
* 3 Dollar Bill sometimes gives you Magneto or Lucky Foot for a room
* Skatole has a 1/13 chance of being shown each time you play (I always thought it increased over time)
* The bonus chance for getting a Devil room if you don't take damage is reset at the beginning of the game and is disabled when you take damage from any enemy
* You don't lose credit for the above or the no-hit achievements via blood donation machines
* Negative luck actually gives you a higher chance to see certain items. You can confirm this with Cheat Engine by taking a lot of Luck Down pills and every room you clear will have a brown chest at the end. -2 luck will give you the most optimal drops

**Where to go from here**

What kind of things would you like me to look into? Any specific items? The things still on my list:

* Room creation
* Formatting. The guide is quite ugly and could use some changes to make it easier to read.
* Slots in greater depth

**Newly added**

1. ""How random items are selected""
2. ""Incidental item pool removal""
3. ""Luck"" stat and ""Clearing a Room"" for random drops
4. ""Slots""
5. ""Brown Chests
6. `5.05` was brown chest
7. ""Boss Rooms"" (messy)
8. ""Dead Sea Scrolls""
9. ""Mini-boss Rooms""
10. **Correction:** Lasers (Technology, you get the x3 damage bonus that was stated. This does not stack more than once.

1366182137.0,1cipvm,List of Rebirth details from Ed's interview with Northernlion,ZAKagan,170,18,49,"Seeing how Ed gave some interesting details in his interview with Northernlion today, by clicking here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxhIDco3sXo)) then just follow along below.

First a quick disclaimer: Nothing here is definitively confirmed. There's still a lot of development time left, Ed didn't confirm quite as much this time, at least compared to his interview with Twinfinite last year. But there's plenty of stuff to like in this interview, and I think Northernlion did a good job of keeping the conversation interesting even when they weren't focusing on Rebirth explicitly.

**On to the juicy details...**

* **Progress Report**: All of the pre-Rebirth content art has been completed

* Ed says that he wants everyone who has played the flash version to have a reason to come back and pick up Rebirth. Rebirth will take advantage of its new engine

* Again

* It's been confirmed before

* **The Mystery Man**: Ed has hinted at this character before, it all depends on what you roll at the start of the run. The catch is that you have to pay some sort of token to play as the Mystery Man. You receive those tokens from beating mom's heart, so if you try and fail as Mystery Man you may need to go back to other characters to earn more tokens. Ed says there will be some balancing mechanic preventing you from rolling a super-powerful (or super under-powered) character right from the start.

* **Rebalancing Soul Hearts**: Soul hearts will not be able to go off the screen. Ed says ""what you see is what you get."" That means 12 heart containers max

* **Rebalancing Items and Trinkets**: Some of the shittier items will get a buff. Others will be turned into trinkets. For example

* **New familiars** with differentiated abilities (meaning that they won't just be turrets)! In Rebirth you will be able to have more than 6 maximum familiars at the same time. Yay

* There will be plenty of bug fixes as well as more clarity on what items do. A lot of the bugs associated with Isaac are due to the limitations of flash and Action Script 2. With the new engine you can expect items to behave as intended. Ed also wants to make the game a bit more clear on certain things for players. By that he doesn't mean flat out telling you what items do

* But there will **more mystery** as well. Ed wants the wiki to have to take a bit of time to catch up with all of the hidden content. The community will have to work together to find all of the extended secret areas (sort of similar to the secret areas in Spelunky).

* **Rewards** for completing bosses/floors/runs under certain times to incentivize speed runs. By reward Ed usually means a new item unlock.

* **Rewards** for ingenuity: What happens when I use the shovel in Sheol? Nothing in the current game

* **Co-op Multiplayer**: Ed has already hinted at some of this before

* There are also plans to allow players to compete in fair races in Rebirth. Although there is no online multiplayer, enemies, items, and floor maps for both players. This will make it possible for players to share runs and thus make it a more fair competition if you and your buddy want to race to Sheol.

* Ed is not a fan of Isaac on touch screens

* **New cutscenes and voiceovers?** Only time will tell. Ed say he will not just remake the old cutscenes with 16 bit graphics. Either he will reuse the old ones and add to them, it's certainly a possibility.

* **A hint at one of the 100+ new items!** This was already covered by reddit user elucidater. Check out his post on the [item (tiny planet) here](http://www.reddit.com/r/bindingofisaac/comments/1chuqq/edmund_reveals_possible_rebirth_item_tiny_planet/) and give him an upvote!

1373034214.0,1howre,PSA: Debunking Isaac Myths - The truth about Poly and Quadshot,elucidater,142,14,30,"So many people claim that the combination of taking Polyphemus and then quadshot is inferior to the combination of taking Quadshot and then Polyphemus. Despite the baseless claims

Apologies for the length of this post but if you believe this myth to be true

*****

###**The Code (Quad+Poly vs. Poly+Quad):**

So let's break down the source code^[1] and prove that the order in which you take items doesn't matter. If you take a look at [this code snippet](http://puu.sh/3vD9C/e175fe3fb7.png) image and you'll see that the game determines damage based on simply if you have those items or not. Firstly it checks if you have Polyphemus and if that comes to be true, damage **per shot** is increased by +5. This damage increase happens whether the player took Poly first or Quad first; **it doesn't matter.**

This is not a new thing which has been discovered

However, that would give a final damage value of 15 (damage = (3.5 + 4) * 2). However if we apply the same base damage to the quadshot+poly calculation, we get a damage value of 8.5. However, this is **damage per shot**, meaning if two shots hit an enemy, that's 17 damage, three shots is 25.5 etc. This scales the same with increases in damage, Poly alone would give you a final damage of 108 and quad would give you 55 per shot

Based on those calculations, so it's a situational increase.

^[1] - [Isaac source code](https://github.com/Xaiter/Binding-of-Isaac/blob/master/source.flr)

*****

###**Theory put into practice:**

Blah blah

Using cheat engine I started a new game and gave myself Quadshot and then in the next room gave myself Polyphemus. After doing so I went to the first boss (which was a non-champion Monstro)

As you can see in [this image](http://puu.sh/3vDHj/0e0bd6fd5d.png)

If we do the math on this

The whole point of this being that the in-game test proves the math from the first section is correct

^[2] - [Isaac Boss enemy health totals](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AnWLI9jOsvdqdHhJUGdxMTR6Tlh2MTdEOTFGWUVHblE#gid=0)

*****


###**""B-but taking Quadshot after Polyphemus is a tears down also"":**

It's also falsely reported that taking quad after poly reduces your rate of tears significantly as opposed to taking poly after quad. Again I tested this in game and timed how long it took for me to fire 10 shots under four different combinations

* Quad then poly = 10 shots = 7.634 sec
* Poly alone = 10 shots = 7.600 sec
* Quad alone = 10 shots = 7.605 sec
* Poly then quad = 10 shots = 7.630

As you can see

Apologies for the super lengthy post

*****

###**The important part:**

The real discussion should be ""should I take quadshot after poly"". 

They give the same result when mixed together but the real debate is what you have BEFORE, if you have Poly first, taking quadshot on top of that would be less effective as the damage *per shot* is actually reduced by roughly half.

This was explained far better by /u/JCXtreme in [this comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/bindingofisaac/comments/1ho38k/psa_poly_after_quad_youre_gonna_be_a_god_quad/cawdc7s)

**EDIT:** Something I didn't take into account is what if you also have a tear modifying item which will actually prevent you from shooting four tears at once with quad shot? And example of this would be if you had Polyphemus and Technology 1. Poly + Tech 1 is 45 damage. However, our damage is cut right down to 25.5, with no extra benefits. This is something I forgot to take into account and was braught to light by Bisnap, so thanks for that.

1342969597.0,wyuvb,Custom Isaac launcher *update*,BubblegumBalloon,127,15,76,"Hi there

Screenshot
http://i.imgur.com/ufzYv.png

Video (week old build): http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0Oys-01Adg&amp;list=UUmURiK_il4BsS5_mAQZJfjA&amp;index=2&amp;feature=plcp

**Things added:**

1. Search Functionality
2. Offline functionality (Loads the wiki locally now which also means a speed improvment in the sidebar loading)
3. Full screen support works again.


**Plans to add:**

1. Xbox controller support. I already kind of got this working using XNA but key presses were being sent to the game rapidly and there wasn't much I could do about it. For example if I held UP on the dpad it would send lots of W key pressed to the game rather than being registered as being held down. This caused controls to be very unresponsive so I am looking to work around this using SlimDX.

If I can get this to work this will also mean that in turn I could create rebindable keys for the game. :) 

2. Pill list. Pretty easy to add

Hard to explain but somebody might understand what I mean.

**Plans for release:**

I'm not sure how to release this yet. I have tried contacting Ed but haven't had a response and I likely wont get a response. For now I will just say ""when its done"", that is something that you guys will have to add yourself to get it to work. Dont worry though, I am going to provide detailed instructions and to make it as simple as I can for those of you who own the game on Steam. It will basically consist of you ripping the swf from the game and the launcher will do the rest. :)

TL;DR probably release after adding xbox controller support.

**Suggestions:**

Any suggestions are welcome :)

1355128843.0,14lh9s,Ed McMillen's Rebirth details from the Twinfinite twitch interview,ZAKagan,124,23,35,"I figured a lot of people didn't watch the twitch ([you can check it out here](http://www.twitch.tv/twinfinite/b/346803604))

**Rebirth details!**

* Nicalis will focus on remaking the entire game (original + Wrath of The Lamb) with some tweaks

* The art style will remain 16bit and the old art will not be included. Ed says that the style is getting there but needs some work

* Isaac's design especially is a WIP. His face will be bigger than it is in the original game because pixel art limits the amount of detail they can add with items

* Arcades will be retooled so they aren't such a time sink

* In general there will be a greater incentive to spend less time on floors. Some new items will somehow be sensitive to time

* Choosing between going to Sheol or the Cathedral will be more meaningful. Ed admits that in the flash version there's not much point in going to Sheol if you've unlocked the Cathedral. He hints that there will be some extra floor equivalent to the Chest after Sheol and that the choice between them will be more interesting. 

* There will be plenty of new challenge runs

* There will be some other feature that ""touches"" on the concept of custom challenge runs, but couldn't due to technical problems. ""People who want custom runs will be very happy with this feature, but in a lot of ways it can be a challenge.""

* There will be no wiki-like feature

* There will be a new ending but Ed hasn't figured it out quite yet.

* In a response to the wiki breaking everything down

* The stats screen is up in the air. Ed says he hasn't thought about it

**Edit: more stuff!**

* There will be a Skatole-like item for spiders.

* The remake will run ""perfect"". Little to no drops in the frame rate are a high priority. Fun fact

* Lemon Mishap will get a buff. The creep will stay on the screen longer and it will recharge a bit faster. Overall

* Ed says that he ""overdid it"" with flying items in Wrath of The Lamb. Flying items will not get cut

**Trivia!**

* Florian programmed much of Isaac in German. Ed will have Florian on to translate his code for the remake.

* Soul hearts going off the screen was a bug. You were supposed to only be allowed the visible number of hearts

* Ed dropped out of community college after some weird guy got the same grade as him in a 3D animation course.

* Edmund admits that he never really had a clear vision of the story (what actually is going on in Isaac) and that it's developed over time. ",self,t5_2sxpk,1355305421.0,,sloth,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/bindingofisaac/comments/14lh9s/ed_mcmillens_rebirth_details_from_the_twinfinite/

Range stat doesn't change how far the knife goes. You can check it yourself very easily.

Range stat actually affects Knife's **damage**.

It is known that the Knife multiplies the damage stat by a number between 2 and 6. The number is actually based on the range stat.

I also tested it with minimum/maximum range + Mom's Knife vs Krampus. The damage difference is very noticeable.",self,t5_2sxpk,1368296785.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/bindingofisaac/comments/1e51iv/psa_moms_knife/

As you can see there as been a graphical overhaul of this Sub-Reddit due to the announcement of BOI:R. We also thought it was time to clean up, either down below or in PM's and we will make anymore changes next weekend.

Note: Toki here and I would like to say that though I have completely re-drawn the graphics for the Sub-Reddit and hope you like them you like them very much  if you have any suggestions for graphics please make sure they get to me. If you don't like it now please explain why down below and hopefully I can get the updated graphics done for next weekend where I will update again *with* feedback.

[We would also like to throw this out there. This month we already have had almost double the amount of unique visitors than subs we have. Don't lurk


Thank you for your patience

Here's the rules the new room follows when its position is determined:

- The new secret room will always be adjacent to only one other room

- The new secret room will never be adjacent to a special room (treasure room

- The room can never extend beyond the borders of the map. (This may seem obvious but is important to take into account)

Here are a couple examples where I've identified possible locations with red squares. (In the second one

1355311337.0,14pyo1,Finding the game too hard? Here are some tips for you,Ritza66,71,10,30,"So we know how frustrating this damn game can be at times. Here are some tips to help get you through to the end.


1) Learn the pattern of the enemy - Every enemy in the game has a pattern to their attacks and movements. Whether it be a sound they make or a certain movement before they attack


2) Book of Revelations - Get on that shit. For me this is the best item in the game. It adds a soul heart and recharges every 6 rooms. If you are having real trouble with the game this is the item you NEED to get. Try to get it as early as possible and build a giant stack of soul hearts for the end game. You can use it in conjunction with the habit to have essentially infinite life until you get to the womb. I know other items will tempt you but trust me this is the one you want. The only exception is if you have some really decent health but pitiful damage. Then something like the book of belial helps out more


3) Get some shields - What I mean by this is things like cube of meat. The more things you get circling around you


4) 1st floor items - Unless the curse of the labyrinth occurs


5) The shop - The shop is something that can be a life saver or just make you tear your hair out. The general rule I use with the shop is I will only use a precious key on it if I have 15 or more coins (or I have a lot of unnecessary keys). This is because the most expensive item is 15 coins. Unless you are in dyer need of a bomb or hearts then it's not worth wasting a key otherwise. 


6) Be careful with your bombs


7) The secret room - On every floor there will be a secret room and a top secret room. You can get x-ray specs or spelunker hat to reveal both of these for you without guessing. The map will reveal just the secret room. If you have none of these then you need to guess. It's crucial to get to the secret room of every floor as most of the time they will give you a lot of coins or a really nice item. To find these by guessing you want to look for an open space not on the map with at least 3 rooms connecting to it on either side. 
To put it in perspective imagine that all of the O's below are the rooms on the map.

                       OO O
                        OOO
                       OO O

Now the secret room will have at least 3 rooms connecting to it so that means there are 3 places it can be which I will show below marked with an X.


                      OOXO
                      XOOO
                      OOXO

Hopefully you see what I mean here. Now you want to plant a bomb right in the middle of the wall that could be hiding the secret room. If it's there then great but if not then try a different wall. Don't bother trying to guess the top secret room though because that doesn't have to be connected to at least 3 rooms. 


8) The devil room - You can get into this room sometimes after you beat a boss. It's not the only way but it's the main way. This room will offer you items in exchange for hearts or soul hearts. It's important not to just rush in and get these items. Firstly you want to look at your hearts and see if you'll have enough to get through to the end by exchanging them. This is where the book of revelations comes in handy because if you have a large stack of soul hearts then your regular hearts become somewhat redundant. You want to know what the item you are exchanging your hearts for does because some of them are really not worth it. Things like the mark


9) The Binding of Isaac Wiki - This is so unbelievably useful I can't even describe how useful it is. I use this to look at devil room items


Also pills are really useful but be prepared for some negative effects unless you have the luck foot or PHD. It's always nice to find the angel room as well and like the devil room it can randomly appear after beating a boss. Hopefully I haven't missed anything out with these tips and hopefully they help you out with the game. If you have any questions for me feel free to ask. I love this game and I am always happy to help out anyone who needs it.

1376157131.0,1k3k8w,[PSA] Range Up != Damage Up with Mom's Knife (?),elucidater,67,10,27,"**Preface**:  
I'm not 100% certain about any of the following information
I already posted something about this on the [Isaac cheat sheet FAQ](http://www.platinumgod.co.uk/faq/#Knife) and noticed a few people talking about this topic since I posted it
If you want to skip all the pointless maths bullshit I really don't blame you at all

******

###What?! Why would 'Range Up' make the Knife do more damage?

For those who don't know

    knife.dmg = dmgdo() * (2 + Math.min(Math.max(knill

And then the following line which links the 'knill' variable to range:

    knill = Math.min(20

This was all documented very well on the [Binding of Isaac Mechanics Guide](https://gist.github.com/dpatti/4419061) by /u/Chiraa

##**Code Understanding:**

**dmgdo()** - The function which calculates the player's current damage.  
**_root.firrr** - The player's current Range Stat.  
**_root.knif** - The current 'charge' of Mom's Knife.

*******

As a result of these links, I've tried and tested every single combination of range stats with Mom's Knife and in terms of damage done, the values always stay the same in various different methods of damage observation:

* *Using the 'Show Damage on Hit' function* - The Knife seems to do the same damage if you have -5 range

* *Using the 'Internals &gt; Show Stats' Menu* - The stats menu in [Spidermod](http://spider853.byethost17.com/BOI/) takes the values for damage, meaning the numbers there are to be trusted somewhat. I noted down the Damage stat values for every equivalent Range stat from -5 range to 35 range and found something similar. It's worth mentioning that **Base Range for Isaac is 23**, but for every range value *ABOVE* base range, the damage of the Knife in the stats screen stays at 21. However, it appears that if you reduce your range below 23, the damage stat will reduce very slightly until a range of 19, where it caps at 18.89 and stays that way for every single range value below 19 (even into negative range).

I dumped all of my observations into a Google Spreadsheet

So if we base these observations purely on those two sources

******

###**The Mathsy bit (aka the part where I go too far in depth)**

First of all it's worth mentioning that this snippet of code is a giant clusterfuck of variable manipulation and I literally have no idea what Florian was aiming to achieve with it

&gt;knife.dmg = dmgdo() * (2 + Math.min(Math.max(knill

**Uncharged Knife Shots:**

First let's assume base damage Isaac with only Mom's Knife and dealing damage by uncharged shots. The second line of code which deals with 'knill = ...' will actually only execute if the player has a _root.knif value of more than 0.35
Putting that into the formula, 4)), which ends up being 7 damage.**

That perfectly fits in with the information we got in SpiderMod where it shows that all uncharged shots do 7 damage

**Charged Knife Shots:**

For the sake of the formula, the Knife charge value can be anything betweeen 0 and 10.

Referring back to the Google Spreadsheet with the maths, which probably makes the values vary slightly. I honestly can't be bothered to go through and investigate how the game makes these slight alterations to the numbers, because the change appears to be so minimal that it won't actually effect the end result anyway.

Either way

***********

##**Summary of Results:**

At a Knife charge of 0.36 (minimum possible), so it would suggest that basically **A base damage charged shot from Mom's Knife will always do 21 damage**.


###**The Important Part**

TL:DR; All that bullshit basically means I can't find any evidence to suggest Range up = Damage up with Mom's Knife, but my goal here was to basically see if this was true or not and if anyone who (for some bizarre reason) read all that maths crap can actually correct me if it's wrong and to just generally see what people think. It honestly didn't take me very long to stick a few numbers into the formulas and write this; probably no longer than someone who makes an Isaac video and posts it here, so I hope it wasn't completely pointless ;)

1. Always try to teleport out of the boss room after killing Mom. This is because you may come back to the boss room and find a devil room or angel room. (I'm sure some of you have heard the angel room music after defeating Mom.)

2. There is a rock behind both the Satan and Angel statues. Sometimes this is a ""tinted"" rock

3. Destroying any machine (fortune teller, so do it whenever you can.

4. If you pick up Mutant Spider (quad shot) after Polyphemus

5. Taking a ""health up"" pill when you have zero red heart containers will give you a new heart container

After Isaac does that, he just won't be able to be like anymore. That kinda correlates to the person playing the game realizing that he/she is running out of things to do.
Alternatively
Whatever it is, is Isaac melding reality with imagination, giving himself the greatest, final challenge: Leaving his imagination game behind.
Including the toy he uses to hang himself?
Considering what monsters he made up
I desperately want this to be true. I really do.
Perhaps Isaac is so obsessed with the imagination game that he starts spending all his time in the chest and begins to ignore the real world and his basic needs for survival. The Dead Baby is a warning from his mind that if he doesn't stop soon
Wouldn't that explain neatly why all the rooms you explore all have the exact same shape as the chest? Also, no matter how hard he trys.

(BTW

EDIT:
Isaac's Dad abandoned the family a long time ago.
In Wrath of the Lamb

Another edit ._.: -WHEN DEVIL ISAAC READS THE BIBLE IN ENDING whatever-

Isaac tries to find new ideas and begins to realize that he is slowly outgrowing his game. He sees his devil form in the mirror as a lot more awesome form of him that

-SATAN/SHEOL (how did I forget this??)-

Satan in-game is actually Isaac's dad.
Basically, and beforehand we see a lot of sad Isaac, so clearly there was a messy divorce, causing Mom to go mad from despair. Therefore, in Isaac's imagination, the only one that could cause such suffering is the devil.",,nsfw,littlegish,

I say this because I see a number of interpretation posts here that are a bit lackluster when it comes to their scrutiny of certain elements -- Dad, Sin, God, the Chest, the Isaac bossfight... something gets left out. I'd like to, if possible, help to lay out the things we know

Dad is someone who's given rather sparing attention in the Binding of Isaac, Dad, and Isaac; the photograph containing only Mom and Dad; and the photograph of Dad's departure.

Dad's key is ""unlocked"" when one beats the chest for the first time, but a common idea is that the fight against ??? represents Isaac fighting his desire to kill himself by suffocation and detachment, or against the last remnants of his attachment to reality that he slew at the end of the Cathedral [implying that the ??? boss is the dead Isaac boss]. These are rather contradictory ideas, but you can still make out the idea that by killing ???, Isaac escapes either his fate or reality.

This seems like it's further reinforced by the actual power of the Dad's Key item -- to open locked doors. Note that it doesn't grant Isaac access to locked Treasure rooms or Shops or Libraries, fling open all the exits to a room in the heat of battle, and unbar the gate on a Challenge Room once you've taken the contents of the chest, or the item, inside. Once again, Dad's Key allows Isaac to escape perilous situations, though sometimes using it simply thrusts Isaac into another equally dangerous rooms

Then comes the matter of the photographs. Though it can be hard to tell

However, the demonic shadow behind Isaac in picture #3], they would seem to imply that Dad left in order to escape the troubled home. This and the use of Dad's Key says to me that the Key represents Dad's abandonment of Isaac and Mom, and that by using the Key, Isaac follows in Dad's footsteps, leaving his troubles behind him and abdicating responsibility for them.

[Hell yeah

A wave mode where you play as one of the Seven Deadly Sins. You are stuck in a room with one door. Every 'wave' is where a new enemy (Issac, second they have 1, third they have 2 etc. But each time it can be a new character with completely different upgrades.
You start as Greed and go though and unlock a new playable Sin at every 5 waves you pass through. Eg. at wave 5 you unlock Wrath and at 10 Lust etc. Then on your next run you can pick each one just as you pick each character at the start of a normal run.

Obviously the way Envy plays will have to be changed but I have yet to find a good way to do this!

It is just a 'see how many waves you can get through' concept.
