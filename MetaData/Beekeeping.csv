1332857256.0,rfunj,"Watching, catching, and moving my first swarm... aka the best story I have about beekeeping yet. ",pippx,38,9

Some of you may remember my rather frantic post about a week ago - I was seeing swarming activity in my yard and didn't have a clue of what to do with them. So what did I end up doing? Nothing. Because the bees did nothing. I watched as the swarm cloud got smaller and smaller until there wasn't a single bee in my yard that wasn't busily going into or out of one of my hives.

So I had a normal week of school

This weekend was a mini vacation at the beach for some friends and I, and what to do you - the bees were swarming again! However, this time is different - they aren't just sitting in my backyard doing nothing. They are actually traveling. Panic!

I go outside and watch as the cloud moves (quickly!) from my yard into my neighbors yard. My husband joins me and we start to wonder - *are they going for that tree? Will they go farther? What are they doing?* Eventually we realized that the bees were all clumping together on a yard swing that the wind had knocked over. Clustered together on the back of a seat cushion

I called my beekeeper friend, spray the bees down with sugar water, then shake them off and into the box. 

I send my husband inside to make sugar water while I try and figure out how we're going to do this. I don't think one person can lift the swing and hold it while the other is thrashing at it, has been very interested in my bees and asked if I would install a hive in her yard). I ask her ""Want to come catch your bees?"" and she, thrilled, arrives with her daughter to help. 

The process went pretty smoothly - lifted the swing, but we watched as the bees made their way straight into the box.

We decided to leave them until it got dark, and moved the box from the ground to a wheelbarrow. There were still a lot of bees attached to the cushions, and I worried that if I moved the box, I took the chance of leaving the queen behind on the cushions. So I wet them down again, then used a broom to sort of scoop/sweep the cushion bees into the box. Most of them got in, but there were still a good amount on the swing. I decided to leave them overnight, hoping that when the sun woke them up the next day, and move there.

And, my husband went out and examined the bees. Everyone was in the hive, safe asleep. I took a few dishtowels and blocked the front and back entrance, then covered the top with an old towel (I didn't have a lid for them, so they had a Rubbermaid lid on top that wasn't quit doing the job). 

Then came the hard part - moving them. The neighbor whose yard they had landed is in the process of fixing a drainage problem in his yard. Our neighborhood sits on nothing but clay, and beyond, his gate door. He's been adding sand and gravel to it in hopes of improving draining, so right now, there is about 8 inches of water-soaked sand and mud between me and the bees, and my yard. 

I gently lifted the wheelbarrow and started making my way through his yard. The sand and silt made it tricky, just for added bulk around the bee box (both to keep them from flying out as well as to keep them a little calm [this is me making wild guesses about bee psychology right here]). 

Then, wheeling this large, blanketed box all the way. Many a car drove by, and I wondered what they thought I was doing. Baby smuggling? Robbing people? I dearly wanted someone to stop and ask so I could say I was transporting bees!

Finally we get to the house of my neighbor who has wanted a hive in her yard. It's about 9:00 at night, and when he realizes what I'm here for, his face lights up and he goes running up the stairs to get his wife. They both come down, and we start the process of planting the bees. 

I had no idea what would happen when I lifted the blanket. Would they stay calm? Would their reaction be cartoonish, make-shift base and all, and set them on the square of bricks that her husband had set out for the hive to rest on. We gently straightened the box, as it had become quite crooked on it's plywood and 2x4 base, then removed the towel from up-top. No bees flying around menacingly, so I pulled away the front and back blockers. Slowly, a few bees crawled out and walked around the outside of the hive

Seeing my bees in another yard was so cool. I talked to the neighbors about putting in a water feature somewhere so the bees would have fresh water

The whole time I was wheeling them down the street, and I just had to share it with you guys!

So I took the frames out and I had basically taken the nuc box and flipped it upside down on the ground. Well I figured I would place the box in the rack and and clean up. While not even thinking about I grabbed the box and man handled it and than got my a bunch of angry bees crawling all over me. 

Apparently a swarm moved in shortly after I flipped the box as there were 3 small pieces of comb but also there were a good number of bees in the box.

I've been stung 8 times at once before

While checking the mail, and running is fun.

Get into house, all calm and mellow. Then the itching starts. OMG, the itching. Everywhere and all at once. I hop into shower so I can rub my skin rather than scratch. By the time I get wet, I can start to tell that things are getting bad fast, and I'm past the point of caring about itching or scratching.

Hop out of shower, no energy, all muscles hurt. My abdomen feels like a slab of pain. Keeps getting worse. Really no swelling at all.

Call 911. Open pen and give address to operator. Ask if I should give myself shot. They don't give medical advice. ""I'm fixing to give myself the shot."" Stab leg with epipen

Some amount of the shot must have made it into my system. Within a minute, who is at the front gate. Give combination to gate. Look in mirror on way outside, and I'm red as a beet with a ghost white face and red eyes. Go home with neighbor to keep an eye on me. 

Took neighbor 18 minutes to get here. Pretty remote out here. Ambulance told operator they were half way here. From the moment of itching to epipen squirting at the wall was about 8 minutes I would guess. 911 call was less than 13 minutes. I would guess 5 or 8 minutes. From the bee sting to itching was about 2 or 3 minutes. Maybe 4. Was in shower maybe 1 minute. Lump in my throat went away in about ten or 15 minutes after shot. Maybe 25 minutes.

I was scared. I don't think I was hyperventilating

Things I did right: Kept the epipen in an easy to find and grab place. Called neighbor and 911. Used epipen. Kept consciousness.

I have no doubt the epipen made it stop. Got better in like 30 to 40 seconds. After a minute or two

We were having a birthday party and had my whole family and some friends over when someone mentioned a huge cloud of insects flying by off in the distance.   I walked closer and immediately noticed it was a swarm.  They flew right over the crowd of us and went right for the empty hive.

Recently the new head of the Apiary division of the Florida Dept of Agriculture decided they are going to bring back enforcement of a law that basically makes all feral hives pests. You now are suppose to have a Pest Control Operators license in order to be able to charge to do bee removals. 

http://swfbees.com/blog/?p=219

Just today the lobby group the Florida State Beekeepers Association that is suppose to represent beekeepers just sold out every small time beekeeper to a group that does not effectively or by design represent them. A group call the Honeybee Technical Council . With a demented sense of pride the FSBA stood with the governor as he signed an unconstitutional bill into law making the Apiary Division now the bee police. 

 http://www.flsenate.gov/laws/statutes/2011/586.161

The HTC can now make whatever codes and ordinances they see fit. The only recourse a beekeeper has now is to sue the state of Florida. 

The Florida State Beekeepers Association leaders are shown here with the our governor (a convicted felon) signing away the rights of beekeepers.

About me: I'm 26 years old


Location: South Florida

Methodology: I'm really interesting in the treatment free methods of beekeeping and have been reading a lot about it.

Bees: I'm three days in with my nuc of Italian-Carniolan and have installed them in their permanent hive box. A feral colony should be acquired in the next week or two as I've made plans to assist a beekeeper who consistently does at least one swarm/cut-outs per week. The plan is to grow both and split both. 

Hive setups: Currently running a Langstroth setup with plastic foundation. Once my hives are split then I plan on switching two of the splits to foundationless. Experimenting with a Warre' hive and Top Bar is something I'll do at some point since I really enjoy crafting. I also have interested family who I'm thinking of making a Top Bar for as a Christmas present.

Side goals: The reason for getting a feral in addition to supplied nucs is because I would like to develop my own queens. Mixing the proven ""survivor"" traits of the feral bees with the characteristics of my Italian-Carniolans

I'd like to branch into small scale pollenation next year or commercial queen raising next year. It'd be nice to focus on the bees as a small scale operation instead of relying fully on part time work while in college.

We have three very large (approx 4'x4') rosemary planters in our front yard that are pollinated by hundreds of domestic bees every year. Because we live in a desert climate

One of the neighborhood kids told us that the hive is not far away

* If the bees are gathering pollen primarily from the rosemary

* (**This is her potential science fair question**) If the bees gather pollen primarily from one flower (in this case, will the ""baby bees"" grow up with a preference for that flower? Will they pass other flowers if that kind is near?

I'm wondering if any of you can help with the answer from what you've seen with your bees, is not an option. However, I do have friends with beekeeper connections that I could utilize.

Thanks!

Edit: formatting

**Edit 2**: I really appreciate all of the informative answers you've given. It seems we really have a lot to learn about bees and the different types of things they will forage for! We learned that while our rosemary planters seem large and abundant to us, this single diet would be seriously detrimental, if not fatal, to the bees, due to lack of constant availability.

We have learned a lot from you Beekeepers and bee enthusiasts. Thank you so much for your time, and advice. We'll be looking elsewhere for her science project, but we'll definitely be watching our bees and learning more about them.

While I was not around, I knew that the remaining comb/honey had to be removed to avoid later infestation of pests. The exterminator contacted the owner and advised them that this task should be done. This task fell to me. Sadly

The hive completely filled the space between one pair of studs on an exterior wall, and the top of the next cavity.
  I filled a 4 foot kiddie pool nearly level to the top with the wasted comb/honey. I was sorely tempted to at least recover the wax
  When I began, and honey began to pool on the floor, 6-10 became at least hundreds, robbing that ruined honey. If I were not aware of bee behavior, I would have been concerned. I was nearly done when the man I work for came out for a look. You should have seen the look on the face of this rugged tough guy of 76 when he saw the mass of bees in the air.
He could not wait one moment to dispose of that comb. I wanted to merely dump the contents into an established burn pit, and that the wax would make the next pit burn a bit more interesting. He would have none of this, as he was concerned about the continued presence of the robber bees. He insisted on burying the old hive immediately.  
   There was just one problem, and that I will do the final clean up at a later date.


tl/dnr: Hive found, I had to clean up, lots of robber bees exceeded my comfort level.

I did not intend for this to become a book
I am wondering if capped honey in a hive that was fumigated would pose a hazard to the hives of robber bees? Perhaps it was best that the remains were buried. Would the wax be recoverable? Of course

I was wondering if anyone here has information about honey-bee behavior in response to hive destruction.  In particular, particularly in Africa.

Maybe some of you work with wild hives in southern Africa (I know that farmers in that region do occasionally harvest honey)

Keep your hives out of the public eye

BRAND (or paint) your equipment with your name or other identifying marks

Strap down the hives to make it difficult to move.

Notify authorities if your hives are stolen to at least make a official report incase someone else gets their hives taken.. A case can be formed then…

* Maximum 1 hive per 1/10 acre
* Minimum of 8' between the hive and neighboring property
* If the hive is less than 30' from the neighboring property
* You must notify all neighbors within 100' of the hive in writing of the proposed design and location
* The hive must not be put in a place where it can become an ""attractive nuisance"" for children.

This is the second time my hives have been checked

Today was my first solo. It's is a lovely sunny day, had on my jacket and veil and gloves (rubber, not leather, may reconsider, read on...) and was trying not to quake in my boots. Literally boots, worn under a long dress. First hive, all's well, and frames 1 and 10 are almost drawn out completely in the top deep. Bunch of burr comb

Realized that it might be a good idea to have pants on when I felt a bee up inside my dress, smush free.

Put on long pants.

Inspected the second hive, Bee stings are *good* for you!), but I did chicken out a little and did a much lamer inspection, because their comb was drawn even more in the top hive body, and because they were annoyed with me.

Closed up (probably a little rougher than the first hive, I was more *confident*) without further incident, chucked the gloves, scraped out the stinger, and am waiting for my heart to stop pounding.

Am wondering if I ought to (not today) go address the burr comb or just figure the bees know what they're doing. And also wonder if I ought to put the shallow honey supers on, if I do put the supers on, should I use queen excluders? As with all I've learned re beekeeping, there are conflicting opinions. 

FWIW, but did not give them sugar water. I almost feel guilty about robbing the honey when it's time. But not that guilty.

Thanks in advance for your advice.



TL;DR 1) Is it okay to leave the burr comb at the bottom of the frames
   and 2) Is it too soon to put the honey supers in (these are a first year hives
and 3) Do you guys use/should I use queen excluders?

EDIT: It's four days since I posted this, yay! I WAS much gentler and more careful, jhdawg). One was bursting with bees, frames 1-10 were filled on top, so I put the excluder and medium honey super on. (I couldn't move the top deep to check if the bottom deep was full too, it weighed about 100 lbs and I couldn't lift it alone! I hope that's okay.)

The other hive does not have comb drawn in frames # 1, right? I plan to wait a week before checking that hive again to see if it's ready for the super. Or two, if you think I can go that long. Any idea why two hives on the same 1/3 acre property are so different in terms of drawn comb?",,False,self,t5_2qtzm,,http://www.reddit.com/r/Beekeeping/comments/i0g0p/so_my_first_solo_hive_inspection/

Did a hive split (with multiple queen cells left in) on May20 and the math I've been taught is that the new queen will emerge on day 19 or so - Jun8.

Did a hive inspection on Jun16 and not a single egg found. We did find two hinged open queen cells and found one queen.  The next time I can go in is Jun24 and the plan is if she's still not laying by that point

The thought of killing her is awful!  Heck

I've also been told that it's a good idea to wait a few hours between removing the queen and putting in a frame of eggs.  It gives the hive the chance to realize that they've lost their queen and when they get the new eggs

Oh, I never hesitate to take care of it....

1366241670.0,1ckhsb,When cut outs don't exactly go right,brendhan,15,3,3,"So today was the day we removed bees from a drain pipe along the bank of the canal. The drain pipe was part of an older system and wasn't in active use. 

The hive had been there for at least 3 months but not more than 6 months. This was one of those where the age of the hive was a factor but not a great one. The drain pipe went into one the many canal water ways that exist in south florida. They prevent sofla from becoming a swamp again. The pipe was about 10 feet from the top of the canal bank. Since the canal water level was low it was almost another 10 feet to the water line. 

The water was about 12 inches deep but the muck would suck you in for another 3 feet easy. The wall of the canal bank is basically sugar sand. When the survey was done it was noted the bees came with attitude. Just approaching the pipe caused them to not like you. 

We had set for today to do the removal. We knew this hive was a bit larger than some of the other drain pipe removals we had done. So we were going to do things a little different today. Some of those ideas worked. Others not so much. 

We had to dig back on the drain pipe and find the back part of the nest. That was done by shoveling the sand from the sides and top until a small pilot hole drilled in the top showed there was no more comb. It is important to note the sand on top of the pipe served a purpose for the hive that was a negative for us later in the cut out. 

The bees were not happy but after about 20 minutes just buzzed more than they actually stung us. I wore my veil for the initial bit and took it off later. Mike wore the jacket with the built in veil for the cut out. Mike probably lost 20 lbs in water weight. I did pretty well myself

The plan of attack was to uncover the pipe and use a sawzall to cut the drain pipe and lift up the upper half and put it on saw horses and then cut and frame comb. 

My first factor is young comb does not stand up to vibrations well. It will collapse under the vibrations of a sawzall or a diamond blade. Old comb holds better. This works well as a rule of thumb with a hive on a tree limb. Note this a metal pipe

The digging and the cut went pretty well. It took 3 sawzall blades because of the thickness and angle of cut. All seemed to be ok. We decided to work on the canal bank when doing the final cut out. This was an incorrect decision also I will explain in a bit. 

Also did I mention it gets warm in south Florida? And things actually conduct heat in Sofla. 

So lets get to brass tacks. Rust is flaky and not the prime example of tensile strength in a metal. The vibrations from the sawzall did not cause the comb to break they caused the rust to separate from the pipe. The bees literally built their nest on a layer of rust. When we cut and lifted the the top half of the pipe most of it stayed in the lower  pipe. You could see the rust layer on the top of the comb. Some of the comb stayed with the pipe. We got about 50% of the hive to stay with the top half. 

So now we are in scramble mode to rescue the part of the comb left behind in the lower half. The upper half is on saw horses embedded in the bank of the canal. So we spend about a hour and half getting comb into frames and trying to rescue bees and vacuum them. Did I mention the sun?

The sun is now warming up the pipe sitting on the saw horses. A dark metal that is absorbing as much heat as fast as it can from our generous sofla sunlight. Did you know bees wax has a very low melt point. Literally as the finishing is being done on the comb in the lower half the upper half is starting fall off the upper piece. And as the commercial says but wait there is more. 

We decided to work the pipe on the canal bank because the upper area was next to a parking lot. We did not want people getting stung. However just as we are almost finished with the upper part of the pipe the sugar sand gives. The upper part and the last piece of comb fall into the canal. We rush and get it. Bring back up with a minimal loss. Just as we finish where we had dug out the pipe where the lower half remained the sugar sand had avalanched into the lower half. Fortunately most of the bees had been vacuumed out. We also believe we got the queen with the vacuum. 

What I would have done differently in hindsight is interesting. We could not cut with a diamond blade on an angle grinder ( no torches either- melts comb) the vibrations still would have caused the separation. However I would not work it in the sugar sand if I had the choice again. Getting the pipe up on the grass would have also meant about a 10 degree difference. I also would have tried to work it under a shade basis if possible. I may also have place rods through it before we lifted it and secured the rods to the upper half to move it up in one piece. 

The sand that covered the back end of the pipe also kept the pipe cool. I probably would use a sprayer with water to keep the pipe cool before during and after the cut. 

What did we lose? Probably about 100 lbs of honey and 20% of the hive population. What did we gain? A lotta wisdom about the next one. 
Even after all the years

My bee buddy, canceled monthly ""bee school"" three times now, but also said no, they'll find water. So I seem to be on my own.

I noticed today that they are stopping under the garden hose nozzle, and on top of the recycling bin lid (of course it is! now I'll worry if every time I lift it I am crushing a bee...). 

Should I move the hose so it drips elsewhere, i.e. no sugar water, no mite meds, etc. So a natural water source seemed the most preferable.

I just recently have subscribed myself to a local beekeepers club, I was hoping you guys could help me out a little.

first of all: **what time of the year is a good time to start a new colony**? My guess is that june

Which takes me to my second question: **how long does it normally take to be proficient enough to keep bees**? I want to be sure that I treat the bees with the respect and care they need; something I don't think will work if you have little knowledge about beekeeping.

Thirdly: I'm confident that bees can thrive in almost any environment. Currently we see more and more urban beekeepers which all have success stories about thriving bee colonies. Now I do not live in an dense urban area myself

Is this something I should bare in mind? **Does a large body of water or a highway close to the beehive have an effect on the population of the bees? More specifically: is the given location good, good enough

Finally I was wondering **what would happen if you don't harvest the honey**? Do you still need to feed them with sugar water? Would they have a higher/lower tendency to swarm? The reason I ask this is because my main motivation for keeping bees is not to harvest the honey

Last weekend it was so heavy that I could barely lift it and it was starting to get so big that it was merging with one of the ones beside it.  It's been recommended to me to harvest the honey from one side only so I'll give that a try.

  The only commercial equipment I plan to buy

My city requires hives to be 30ft

Therefore
My brother has a small property
He keeps a small tank for growing aquatic plants, any available dry surface on this tank is covered with bees and wasps collecting water.
**Question** could there be benefits or problems from this bee traffic for my hive/hives.(should I check a few of these bees for mites?)
I have two additional prospects for hive locations:
A friend is starting a [CSA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community-supported_agriculture) and this could be great for both of us. This property also has an existing bee tree from which I hope to catch possible swarms.
Some other friend have a small nursery
I don't think I will have a problem finding convenient places to place hives.

I plan to start small, or by products. (self supporting hobby, I hope)

I was first exposed to Beekeeping when serving as an Agriculture Volunteer with the US Peace Corps in The Gambia (2011-2013).  I loved it there.  I came back to SF Bay area in January '13 and started building my hive numbers on a shoestring budget.  I currently manage 11.  That's enough for a serious hobbyist.

I'm wanting and willing to expand to 40-50 in the 2014 season.  I have a really good idea about how to bring top-bar beekeeping to the USA as a economically viable way to beekeep.  I am going to incorporate some of the wisdoms shared by Wyatt Mangum

Basically our setup is that the Bee Hive is indoors with a 1 ft. pipe that is through the wall to the outside on the 2nd story. The bee box is actually made of plexiglass so that children and adults alike can actually see the working hive. The building temperature is a stable 63-65 degrees every single day. The lights are turned off at night though sometimes the cleaning crew has them on until late. We do not cover it at night but maybe this is something we should have done. The box has plenty of room inside of it with sheets for combs as well as a sugar water dispenser that is easily excessible. Our facility is in a temperate california climate and I believe we most likely lost the queen while it was still beautiful outside. We noticed the numbers slowly decreasing untli there was only a few live bees left by last week. The hive survived for about 4-5 months before this actually happened. I have no idea if there is anything that we could have done differently. We have a bee keeper who is a little off(aren't we all) and isn't the most social person. He was great about checking the hive every couple of weeks and when it failed said that it happens and he didn't really have any answers.

Is this normal?  About half of the dead bees are in a desicated condition so my guess is that these ones have died in the hive and were brought out when the weather was warm enough for some housecleaning.  The other half are in perfect condition so perhaps they are the ones that stepped outside for some fresh air and the cold was too much?

So far Vancouver has had a very warm winter and a drier than normal one as well.  Daytime temperatures reach about 6-8C and at night it hasn't dropped below 3-4C in quite some time.

1.  I wanted to build my own hive

2.  In terms of the frames

3.  Do you ever catch your own swarms?  Buy nucs?  Where do you get your bees?

4.  What are some helpful tips or tricks that I should be mindful of?

Thanks for all the feedback

Beekeeping sounds pretty straight forward from what I have read and is there any ""go to"" books that you guys would suggest for a novice?

I'll just add that I live in Melbourne

Came across [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/wrqiz/midair_bee_collision/) in r/funny today and it gave me a much needed laugh!

It was a pretty stressful spring: split done to prevent swarming

Everything was looking great in both hives two weeks ago with very healthy queens in both and laying like mad, no eggs and no larvae with a scattered capped brood pattern.

Thankfully there is one queen cell in the works (capped and starting to get nice and long) in the big hive and my small hive is still doing really well.

A laugh though is always appreciated! :o)",self,t5_2qtzm,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/Beekeeping/comments/wsvc3/much_needed_laugh/
