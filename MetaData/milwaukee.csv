So excited I could puke.

They found it abandoned on N 5th St off MLK Dr. Nothing was broken, which is fine, it wasnt anything special. Plus I already bought a new one and installed it today. Thankfully they didnt cut any wires, break anything, or screw with anything. They also stole my Honda manual, a case of burned CDs that are all about 10 years old and didnt even belong to me, an empty dollar store address book, my new rainboots

So all in all

No one knows who did it

FUCK YEAH (╯°□°)╯︵ ┻━┻

_______________________________________________________________________

My car was stolen last night. From outside the federal building downtown on Wells St and 3rd St. from metered parking spot 4880 between the hours of 3PM and 9PM while I was at work. I cant even believe someone stole an ENTIRE car. My mind is blown in every way.

So some jerkoff in Milwaukee has my dark green (almost black), has a rear fin, and a sunroof fin on top, tan leather interior. Three windows (not passenger window) and rear windshield are slightly tinted.

I would do anything to get it back.

I just wanted to let you know that my wife and I really enjoyed the crap out of your city. Here's a brief overview of what we did. 

We got into town around 11 and went straight to Discovery World. It was a totally enjoyable little museum and we loved petting the Stingrays and Sharks. The science side was also fun but a lot of stuff didn't seem to work. It was delightfully uncrowded though. A Saturday late morning/early afternoon at the Museum of Science and Industry or the Shedd would've been a madhouse and I mean that in a good way. 

After that we decided to hit Sobelman's for lunch. I'm not going to lie to you

After lunch we went to Collector's Edge South. I was glad I did a little research because I was hunting for a couple of specific (and not necessarily rare,500 dollars. I got a serious nerd boner holding it. 

Books in tow we drove to the Bronze Fonz and snapped a quick photo. As we were walking back

We tried to go to the Brady Street fair but we couldn't find any place to park and it just wasn't worth driving around looking any longer than we did. We went to Alterra on the Lake for some coffee and read for a little while and then we went to the Third Ward. 

We walked around the Public Market for a bit and then walked around the Third Ward trying to decide where to have dinner. We wound up at the Smoke House and it was amazing. The second best BBQ I've had in my entire life (Slow's BBQ in my hometown of Detroit is the best). I wanted to have the whiskey ice cream, we headed back home. 

Here's a photo of us at the Bronze Fonz. Maybe you saw us

All discussion about the planning of the meetup is going to end here. We need to stamp out these details or this isn't going to happen. I have read all the comments and have made a couple of decisions based on them and we are going to go with that.

~~1. **We need a permit**. We are planning on Lake Park. We have a little over fifty people RSVP'd but that was opened long ago. I think we can assume we will have a little less than fifty. If not, we can look to other parks as central as possible.~~

2.  This event will be BYOB. We will be mixing minors and adults and we just don't want it to get messy. 

3. This event will be a pot luck. I will try and bring a grill/charcoal. Barbwirebird has also offered to bring grills/charcoal. EVERYONE ELSE NEEDS TO BRING SOMETHING FOR PEOPLE TO EAT. Everyone doesn't need to bring something for fifty people to eat

~~4. There are a couple things that we need to make sure we have but aren't general food items. I am going to assume the general food items will all even out. These items are: Plates/napkins

If you want to give people an idea of what you are bringing


EDIT: The Time IS NOON

We will be at Site #5 at  Lake Park. [A map can be found here](http://county.milwaukee.gov/ImageLibrary/Groups/cntyParks/maps/Lake1.pdf).

The permit was taken care of by a member of our community and all is well in the world. See you Saturday!

So

We stayed at a La Quinta on North Port Washington Road

That night we went to Y Not II to check out that bar (again as recommended). It was pretty cool. We had a couple of liters before decided to drive around some more

Holy shit. Maybe a weekend night wasn't the best night to check out Brady Street, Bob, was really cool and gave us some suggestions for other things to check out in town.

Sunday

After Comet, bought some Wisconsin cheese and took it across the walkway to the wine bar where we had some flights.

From the market, which is fucking awesome nonetheless, but not what I was expecting.

We decided to check out Water Street next and ended up in one bar (I forget the name) that had an overwhelming smell of what might have been stale beer. It was enough that we didn't stick around to order anything because it was just far too pungent of a smell. That led us a little further down the street to Trinity Three Irish Bar, friendly, and I have no complaints about them at all. It was just the fist-pumping patrons. (I shit you not, there was fist-pumping while we were there.)

Our last day there, and for only $8.50 for each person.

We then went on to do the Lakefront brewery tour, we asked the girl at the counter which of the bars she's recommend for a couple of out-of-towners about to drive back to Illinois and she suggested Wolki's.

Wolski's was a great bar to go to. The family/divy feel was great and is something I've really been missing since I moved away from all of my home bars in Tulsa.

After Wolski's, because parts have a great city vibe but you can still find parking.

**tl;dr**
Went to Milwaukee for a few days

Conejito's - Fucking great and surprisingly cheap

Y Not II - Not bad. Good deals on the liter mugs of beer

Thurman's ""15"" - Pretty cool bar. Bob

Comet Cafe - Great brunch early in the morning

Public Market - Wine and cheese. What else can I say?

Oakland Gyros - Pretty damn good salad on pita

Trinity Three - Fist pumping. Not my favorite place

The King and I - Great Thai lunch buffet

Lakefront Brewery - Awesome tour with cool people working there

Wolski's - Favorite bar so far in Milwaukee

Conejito's again - More good

I thought we should start this thread to talk about a fundraiser or direct donations.  This is heartbreaking to me that this happened to our community and I think we should start talking about what we can do.  I called the bank to set up an account

Should we start a direct donation fund with an accompanying name directly to Freodtert?

https://my.froedterthospitalfoundation.org/page.aspx?pid=298


 EDIT: I am going to call Feodtert tomorrow and see if they have something set up or if we can use their donation page with some dropdown/comment combo to make sure it goes to the victims.

About a year or so ago I started a side project involving urban hiking/exploration in Milwaukee. I've been gradually expanding my little operation to invite others to join me on my expeditions. 

Basically we start from one point of the city and make our way to the other side or more often than not we loop our way back to our start  point. Along the way I find graffiti, and anything that really catches my camera's eye. 

If you ever needed an excuse to explore the city here it is! 

I have three hikes lined up every other week. The first one is this saturday (July 13th) and is dedicated to exploring Milwaukee's south side. All are welcome and details below.

But I need to GTFO of New York. It’s just too much of everything -- too big, too constantly aspirant, too exhausting in its tedious fashionability, too sure of itself. What I liked about Milwaukee is that it was large enough to be interesting and adequately cultured, but small enough to feel “knowable” and accessible and down to earth. Not to mention, it’s way more affordable. I miss the East Side, Downtown, Riverwest. I miss riding the 30 and 15 buses (I know

I left Milwaukee not because I disliked it but because I thought I was taking the obvious next steps to bigger and allegedly better places in life. It’s true that I improved my education and broadened my experiences

So now I am wondering, some revitalization of the former Pabst zone, the new train station and Harley museum, and what seems like a reversal or at least stoppage of the population decline that has plagued other Great Lakes cities. Oh, and I see that Walker’s Point is now being called the “Fifth Ward” -- it’s comforting to know that greedy real estate agents are the same everywhere...they always want to rename neighborhoods to sell more condos...

Anyway, let me know about that, too.

tl;dr - I want to leave New York and come back to Milwaukee after a decade away. What should I know?

1) If you are on Bradford Beach, beer cans left in the sand, and food in the sand that was attracting seagulls to where people were trying to lay out and play volleyball.  It is depressing enough that we have this big beautiful lake that no one in their right mind should swim in thanks to pollution, lets try to keep the beach clean, alright?

2) If you are walking down the sidewalk, walkers, etc., all have to share the same path, but it gets old having to stop completely at times because people will step right in my path on my bike without even looking.  I certainly know that this is the cost of trying to bike on the lakefront, but I don't think bikers should take full responsibility for the safety of others.

3) If you are a biker

4) If you are walking with a small child that isn't old enough to look around and be careful for themselves, biking, and car traffic to just let your kids walk along without supervision.

Unfortunately he hit a deer on the way and caused pretty considerable damage to his car.

As a way to help him pay for the damage to his car i told him i would put our CD's up on band camp for a lower price and give him what ever profits we make for the next two months.

You can listen to both of our albums in their entirety (in lossless format) on the site also btw

The gray/white cat is your typical lap cat. She wants nothing more than to cuddle on your lap all day long. She is a bit more shy than the other one and will take a bit of time to warm up to a new home.
