Build me a son whose wishbone will not be

one who will learn to laugh
one who will reach into the future

They own and control the corporations. They've long since bought, the city halls

Well we know what they want. they want more for themselves and less for everybody else

You know what they want? they want obedient workers. obedient workers, the reduced benefits, the end of overtime and vanishing pensions that disappear the minute you go to collect it, and now thy're coming for your social security money. They want your fuckin' retirement money. They want it back so they can give it to their criminal friends on Wall Street, and you know something? THEY'LL GET IT. They'll get it all from you sooner or later cause they own this fuckin' place. it's a big club and you aint in it. You and I are not in the big club. By the way, it's the same big club they use to beat you over the head with all day long when they tell you what to believe. All day long beating you over the head with their media telling you what to believe, what to think and what to buy.

The table has tilted, it doesn't matter what color shirt you have on. Good honest hard-working people continue - these are people of modest means - continue to elect these rich cocksuckers who dont give a fuck about you. they dont give a fuck about you.
