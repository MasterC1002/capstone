1274789019.0,c7vub,Hurley Time!,BuddyZero,517,146,201,"Honestly, and then Christian Shepherd has left the building

""That's how Jacob ran things. Maybe there's another way. Maybe there's a better way.""

Fuck yeah there is. It's Hurley Time.

What's Hurley Time? It's drinking The Water from a crappy plastic bottle, but real, grey water scooped from the creek bed. It's not about invoking references to Shiva's blinking eye; it's about quoting Star Wars. It's about asking Ben (help me Obi Wan!), the character who embodies so many dark sides of human nature, as well as the fallibility that comes with devotion to an uncertain divinity, to work with him, so that Hurley can learn from him and account for these shortcomings. ""It would be my honor, and Hurley just replies ""Cool."" 

If you thought the story's surface reading was happy, and with it he became self-alienated, able to view both his internal and external human psyches as they wreak their own forms of havoc. Consider the show's ensemble cast: by including a blisteringly wide array of philosophies, it invited more tailored opportunities for identification and ultimately self-reflection for more viewers than practically any other show. In short, the cast allowed viewers to examine the externalities of their own philosophies and hopefully even recognize the shortcomings. 

Hurley is unabashedly Dude-like. He's practically a modern Buddhist who doesn't get hung up on the edifices. Hurley is right behind Desmond in accepting that time is not necessarily linear, as Buddhists believe of the world itself.

Hurley isn't out prowling around the jungle, as well. Hurley knows that finding a cache of fresh food can be a curse, or that winning the lotto can be a damnation. The best that he can hope for is peace through understanding and balance.

Ultimately, and that understanding human nature is important, and that the same mistakes can echo on unchecked. He knows that there is nothing to be gained from hunting down the great mysteries of the universe, and that seeking the light can be fatal at best. But he also knows that it's necessary to pull the plug out of the wall and put it back in to get things working again. Hurley knows that a reset is necessary to overcome the inevitable failures of machinery, and that window dressing is nothing more. 

So why not make Hurley the star? The exact same reason that you would drive a show like Lost with a mystery system that goes unanswered: because, etc.) come out the other. American Christians want to see Good vs. Evil, and they want to see pure evil embodied. And they want to see a Christ cycle, where Jesus sacrifices himself for the good of mankind and rises again to heaven. And they want to see all the mysteries of the universe laid bare and all the answers given, and that's the promise that gets everyone's attention. But Lost won't give it to them. And Lost will give them a Christ cycle where the Christ figure is practically Byronic and so thoroughly redeemed that he's barely human by the time it ends. And Lost will give them an Evil that isn't really evil, and then they won't even give it a name in order to show just how ridiculous and projection-based the idea of personified evil is in the first place. Lost conjured the Christian mythos and then teabagged it in the face. But the best part is that most of the audience hasn't even realized it yet. They're just confused, or bitter or disfranchised, instead of the answers that they'll never find

So hats off to Damon and Carlton. Like it or not, welcome our new fat Hispanic overlord.

**The Numbers:**

Obviously, but there's an important symbolism that kind of got left behind in all the explanation and demystification.  They all add up to 108, which was also featured on the mural in the Hatch second season, alongside the very Buddhist DHARMA symbols.  Take a look at something I found a couple years back.

&gt;The ‘108 Bodhisattva' Terma is essentially a search for ‘108 Beings of Great Compassion, who will, in this age, be ‘catalysts for change and transformation on the earth’.

So that'd be the Losties.  It's important to note that a bodhisattva is someone who should have achieved enlightenment and escaped from the endless cycle of death and rebirth

**Games/Black and White:**

Obviously all alluding to the eternal battle between good and evil, which paints existence as a struggle for the souls of men between a creative, good deity and a destructive, evil one.  Take a look at this:

&gt;Zurvanism's principal feature is then the notion that both Ahura Mazda (MP: Ohrmuzd) and Angra Mainyu (Ahriman) were twin brothers, that is, Angra Mainyu chose to be evil: ""It is not that I cannot create anything good, but that I will not.""

In addition, repeated indefinitely for its own purpose.

**Fire:**

A very important symbol in Zoroastrianism

**Various Egyptian Imagery**:

Mostly ties into the Egyptian concept of the afterlife

In addition, a place where life originates, from the light at the heart of the Island.  They were kind of explicit about this in Across the Sea.  The light at the center of the Island is what enables the universe and all the things in it to exist and live.  That's why the waters can act as a fountain of youth and revive people.  (As a side note, I'd like to go on record as saying that the fountain DID revive Sayid, as that sort of resurrection seems to be out of Smoky's jurisdiction.)

**Eyes:**

This one's fairly straightforward

&gt;When [Shiva] opens His eyes, with no beginning and no end. Lord Shiva is the Master of Yoga, as He uses His yogic power to project the universe from Himself. The half-open eyes also symbolize His yogic posture.

So

**So what's my conclusion from all this?**

They used a lot of symbolism from ancient religions (and more contemporary ones, a protoreligion of fact that's being grasped at in parts but never on the whole.  Most of the focused religions place an emphasis on a complete cycle of death and rebirth as necessary opposites that create one another.  The series has also been chock full of other binary opposites that create one another through their opposition (the existence of science creates the need to have faith, for example).

By ""moving on"", and created it anew, beginning the cycle over again.  ""There is no now"" because ""now"" has not started and has already ended.  They are between creations.

This is obviously just one reading, especially since I'm sure I missed some stuff.

*Edit:* I forgot to mention that the final conversation between Jack and Christian took place in front of a stained glass window featuring the symbols of all the major world religions,False,,t5_2qhag,False,,,t3_c7izf

[video](http://www.collegehumor.com/video:1936291)  
  
Do any of these questions really matter to the overall story and to the characters?  Feel free to add on to these answers and correct me if I am wrong.  
  
**1. Why did the monster kill the pilot?**  

It’s been said so many times that the island won’t let you leave.  Killing pilots and/or captains (authority figures) is a recurring theme: Both pilots of Oceanic 815, even Frank’s Ajira 316 copilot all died immediately after crashing on the island.  Frank seems to be the one exception.  Perhaps the island let him live because his purpose was to take the Ajira Six off the island.  By the by, “Ājira” is Arabic for “afterlife.”  
  


**2. What did Locke see when he first saw the smoke?**  

In “The Cost of Living” (season 3
  

**3. What’s with the polar bear in Walt’s comic?**  

It was a polar bear in a Green Lantern comic book (en espanol).  In said issue Green Lantern and the Flash fight a polar bear.  
  
Is this really a mystery?  It’s a clever piece of foreshadowing.  We know how/why polar bears ended up on the island.  DHARMA used polar bears in their experiments; they tried to adapt them to the tropical climate.  At some point DHARMA trained one of the polar bears to turn the frozen donkey wheel.  Thanks to Ben and Locke
  


**4. Where is Christian Shepard’s body if it’s not in the casket?**  

The Smoke Monster took the form of Christian and likely hid the real body somewhere so it wouldn’t be found.  

One of the most ambiguous and confusing aspects of LOST is Christian Shepard.  Smoke Monster Locke claimed he was pretending to be Christian.  But was he really?  It seems to me like he was lying.  I think the Christian Shepard seen on the island was really the ghost/sprit/soul (whatever) of Christian Shepard stuck there like Michael and so many others.  That would explain why he was in Jacob’s cabin protected by the circle of ash.  When Christian told Locke he had to move the island he was setting up Jacob’s grand plan (long con?) to defeat the Smoke Monster.  
  


**5. Why did the psychic say that Claire had to fly on Oceanic flight 815

Richard Malkin the psychic was a fraud.  He admitted this to Mr. Eko in “?” (season 2, Jacob and his brother being the best example.  Or maybe he really was a physic and Jacob told him what to do.  
  


**6. Why did the Others want Walt so badly?**  
 
Probably the same reason Charles Widmore wanted Desmond so badly: He’s special
  
Another reason: The Others used Walt to get Michael to get Jack
  


**7. Who sent Kate the letter telling her about her mother being treated for cancer in the hospital?**
Who the fuck cares?  It’s Kate.  Everybody hates Kate.  It could have been anyone
  


**8. How does Walt know about the hatch and why does he warn Locke not to open it?**  

Was Walt referring to the hatch?  He wasn’t specific.  Walt is psychic and too young to control his abilities or even know when he’s using them
  

Walt is special.  Children are special.  This is a trope used in countless sci-fi and horror films.  Think Poltergeist.  Every child we’ve seen on the island has had visions
  


**9. Why does the Smoke Monster make mechanical sounds?**  

That’s a stupid question.  If you want to complain about how an imaginary monster made out of black smoke doesn’t sound like all the other smoke monsters you've encountered in your worldly travels
  


**10. How was Walt able to “apparate” before Shannon?**  

Was Walt really there?  Or was Shannon just seeing things?  It was established in “Special” (season 1
  


**11. How did Walt communicate with Michael using the swan computer?**

**12. What is the deal with Kate and that horse?**  

Kate is the glue that holds LOST together.  Glue is made from horses.  Not good enough?  OK, episode 11) Beatrice “Bea” Klugh’s horse is tied up outside the Flame, the DHARMA communications station where Mikhail lived all by his lonesome.  Or maybe the horse Kate saw wasn’t there at all.  Maybe she was succumbing to the stress of surviving a plane crash and being stranded on a craxy magical island.  Also, does the title “Enter 77” foreshadow Jack, Kate, Hurley and Sayid entering 1977?  
  
**13. Why are supplies still being dropped on the island after the purge and by who(m)?**  

If you got one thing from the DHARMA Initiative storyline is that they’re a bunch of well-meaning techno-hippies who are fairly brilliant scientists but who are fairly ignorant when it comes to other areas of expertise, paid for by trust funds or whatnot, and then having said drops continue long after the Initiative went defunct?  
  

DHARMA is still dropping supplies to their men inside the Swan hatch
  

**14. What triggered the lockdown and why on earth would anyone design it so that during the lockdown black lights go on?**  

The food drop triggered the lockdown.  DHARMA doesn’t want their people to see where the drops come from (probably why we, the Swan was designed and built in the seventies, man.  
  


**15. What happened to the original Henry Gale?**
Henry Gale’s balloon crashed on the island.  He broke is leg
  
Here’s something that will blow your mind: Henry Gale is Rose’s brother!  
  
No he’s not
  
**16. What happens to the original timeline Libby between the mental hospital and getting on the tail section of flight 815?**  

Libby’s husband Dave died.  That caused her to have a breakdown.  If you want more information on Dave and Libby I suggest you re-watch the Hurley-centric episode “Dave” (season 2
  

**17. Who built the four-toed statue?**  

The statue is Taweret.  The Egyptians probably built it sometime before 1800 BC, once lived there.  “Across The Sea” takes place in 23 AD.  We know there were people on the island before then.  
  


**18. Why does only one specific bearing get you off the island?**  

We’ve seen what happens when you go to and fro the island at the wrong bearing.  The island is protected and hidden from the world.  It regularly moves around various oceans; it’s not just confined to the Pacific.  Ever wonder how a drug plane taking off from Africa,,False,,t5_2qhag,True,,True

1274738518.0,c7ov2,"I think the most important question was, in fact, answered...",kentomc,227,108

We miss the answer to this if we get too caught up in the details.  I see it like this:

What we already knew:

1) The island was a fragile gate at once protecting the world from annihilation and providing its life-force.

2) An individual has always been charged with protecting this fragile gate.

3) Messing with the gate has serious consequences to the basic foundations of our world

4) MIB wanted desperately to leave the island but couldn't do so once he became the smoke monster.

What we learned from 'The End':

1) The smoke monster's ultimate goal was to open the gate (destroy the island).  He knew this alone would free him
  
2) He did not know this would make him mortal again.

3) Opening the gate turned the island and possibly the whole planet into a colorless and chaotic hell-scape. 

What we can infer:

1) All the warnings about not letting MIB leave had nothing to do with him being evil or what he would do if unleashed on the world, what would happen if he managed to open the gate.  MIB was not evil.  He was selfish.  He did not care what the consequences of opening the gate were.  He just wanted out.
 
2) The protectors were simple flawed humans, passing it to one of these twin boys.

3) Jacob was just as human and flawed as anyone.  He made the mistake of killing MIB in such a way that his continued existence as the smoke monster was bound up in the preservation of the gate.

4) Much of what Jacob did over the years was damage control to make up for his initial mistake.  In the process he played fast and loose with many lives.  He did not have all the answers.

5) Jack


I think what was hard to swallow about all this is that we wanted Jacob to be something he wasn't - divine, but he ended up being a flawed man, thrown into his position against his will and the will of his predecessor, and creating more problems than he resolved.

But in the end

Most importantly, ultimately found purpose and love in their lives.  Regardless of his intentions, Jacob's machinations managed to give these lost souls purpose and helped them achieve peace.

Pretty excellent way for it all to wrap up if you ask me.

Take out some time today to read this article. If you do, but it is by far and wide the best explanation of LOST's overall meaning, and what the Island truly is. The article seriously ties all those missing ends together that the writers kept ""ambiguous,"" and methodically explains how monumentally intricate, yet clear, the shows underlying themes and meanings really were. 

Anyways, in the show and the story it told. I'm currently rewatching the series, I'm on S2E16, and EVERYTHING he points out makes complete sense and ties the whole damn story together. It also makes me appreciate that the writers DIDN'T explain everything, rather have us in true LOST fashion, figure out the puzzle for ourselves. Anyways, I hope we have some good discussions about all this... (Even if you're not convinced)



tl;dr If you're a fan of LOST

EDIT- Wow. I didn't expect the wide variety of opinions you guys have. I guess the reason why I like this explanation, I like to think that the head writers (DARLTON) working on a show as ambitious and popular as LOST had an idea from the get go on what the island was, and how it would affect the writing process when creating the characters story acts and the shows overall themes. 

EDIT 2- Check out these lyrics from 'Time' By Pink Floyd.... ""And you run and you run to catch up with the sun but it's sinking. Racing around to come up behind you again. The sun is the same in a relative way but you're older. Shorter of breath and one day closer to death. Every year is getting shorter

THE DEFINITIVE AND UNIFIED EXPLANATION

Many people are torn about the Lost finale. Some feel it was a cop out. Some feel that the writers took the easy way out. Some do not like it because they wanted all the answers handed to them on a silver platter. Below you will find a total explanation of the show that sufficiently answers every aspect (of course, so all of you feeling conned by the finale can hopefully get some closure and better understand things. Once again, these are not all of MY ideas. Many are borrowed, and put together in ONE UNIFYING EXPLANATION. 

 1) THE ISLAND

What was the Island? Why was it there? Did it have a purpose? Yes. It is believed by many that the Island was in fact the MAIN CHARACTER of the show. Stop for a minute and consider this: What if the entire show was not told through the characters perspective, specifically, what the light was in the center of the Island. In the episode ""Across the Sea"" Jacob and the Smoke Monster's mother shows them the light, and says a little bit of this light is inside every man, but no matter how much they have, they always want more. I believe that the light in the center of the Island... is TIME. Yes, I did say time. Here are some reasons for this:

1) You see the light each instance that there is a TIME jump in Season Five
2) Every man has a little bit of time (our lives) but we always want more
3) Jacob's mother goes on to say that the light is a physical manifestation of ""Life, then time fits the description almost perfectly. 

So if the light is time

If the light is time, and future. This means that the light in the center of the Island holds the memories of all of those ever to come to the Island. 

The Island gets the memories of those who go there?

Yes. What if flashbacks and flashforwards aren't JUST a storytelling device? What if the Island is able to GAIN ACCESS to someone's memories when they come to the Island? If the Light is a physical manifestation of time

From here

So what is the 'Island's goal'?

Its goal is to escape. You see

Could you explain that a little more please?

Sure. In Season Five, Miles, Faraday, Jin, and Juliet are sent back in time. These time jumps land them in many different eras. Pay special attention to one of the jumps, where the characters find the well. John Locke climbs down inside to adjust the wheel, hoping to end the time jumps. Let us quickly go through the history of this well: 1) It is built by the settlers who are searching for the core of the Island
3) Our losties jump back in time to somewhere in between numbers 1 and 2. John goes down the well. 4) There is another time jump

This means that at the time of Number 4, Sawyer, Miles, Faraday, Jin, and Juliet. All of the things these people have seen and done in seasons 1-4, the Island now knows.

So what does this mean?

Basically, Faraday, Miles, and Locke. This means it knows what will happen for the next TWO THOUSAND YEARS. And because of the rules of ""Whatever Happened Happened"" it has no choice but to carry these things out. How is it supposed to carry out the future? It's an Island.  That's the thing. It can't on its own. The Island itself cannot make all of these events occur out of thin air. It needs someone to help. And that's where Jacob and the Man in Black come in. Now remember, in the center of the Island is Time itself. The Light. And within this light, the past, present, the Island (if it wishes) can piece together memories into dreams

Yes. And Jacob's mother was the one before him.

Then what is the Smoke Monster?

There is a perfectly logical explanation for the Smoke Monster, first I'd like to cover the history of the Island so you have some background.

Alright. Explain the history

I'll try to make it quick.
Several thousand years ago, Egyptian in descent. At some point in time they discovered the cave, and the light within. They built several structures around the area, including a statue of Tawaret, a temple, and series of waterways and tunnels underneath the ground. How did it become an Island? What were these waterways for?

The Egyptians discovered the cave

What was that structure doing?

Well

So what does that mean? Manipulating the water and the light? Was was the stone pillar and the wheel doing this?

Well, slowly draining from the reservoir. However, the Egyptians designed a system where the light is covered in a pool of water.
When light passes through water, and sent backward to where it came from. We know from Season Four that the electromagnetism within the Island forms a field around it.
So, Paleozoic, and Mesozoic era the continents were constantly shifting, it is very possible that the land had been on many different places on the Earth's surface. Submerging the light in water is what causes the Island to move, by refracting it backwards, and in turn, sending the Island to previous locations and times in its past.
Today
I suspect that the Island continued to move through time and shift position after it had departed from Tunisia. It was moving constantly. However (as we know from season five) this has negative physical effects on people. In order to stop the jumps, animals, and plants on the Island. I mean the original land. The stone and earth and rock's aging is near stopped.
Before continue
The Source/Heart of the Island: Located just beyond the bamboo forest where Jack wakes up. It is the largest pocket on the Island
The Swan Station: Also called ‘the hatch’. This pocket is buried deep underneath the ground as a reservoir of light. It was inactive until the DHARMA Initiative discovered it, and it was nearly all released. We will get to more on the hatch later.
The Orchid: Discovered by Roman settlers, as well as a wheel. When the wheel is turned, it will open a waterway that allows the pocket to be flooded, which in turn causes light refractions and the Island moving. Theoretically, the water should drain out after the wheel has been turned. However, it is very old, and was jolted from its axis when Benjamin Linus turned it. It is hypothesized that the water drained out

Here is a review of some of the basic concepts:
1) The water refracts the light
To stop the Island moving, causing the time of the the Island to SLOW DOWN.
The Swan and Orchid station are reservoirs of time that were inactive until discovered by DHARMA

2. DESMOND AND THE FLASHSIDEWAYS

Now that the Island's history has been explained, first I would like to cite some information about Desmond Hume, and explain what the Flashsideways is that we see in Season Six.
Remember
Now we will take a look at the effect of the Island holding the memories of all the Island’s inhabitants. 
Our personalities are made up from memories. They define who we are, they will not REALLY fully die. This is because their memories still exist SOMEWHERE, which means that THEY still exist somewhere. This is the flash sideways. It is the dream world that they all created together, constructed from their memories by the Island.

The shows I've watched chronologically and followed to conclusion can be counted on one hand. What I do like, and you'd never forgive him if he didn't put his all into the last line- even if it is

It was obvious going into the last season that there would be no perfect resolution to every mystery, though, I was sort of amazed at the number of clean, interesting explanations we DID get along the way- and I'm grateful they weren't ham-fisted and usually required the viewers to make some of the connections on their own. All I asked from this finale was one thing- it needed to ""feel right."" 

It felt absolutely right. 

There were some missteps. I'm still perplexed about why Jin and Sun were reunited in the purgatory world without their daughter (as she wasn' ""born"" yet....and yet actually existed in the ""real world."" Meh.) I'm unsure why Sayid was with Shannon in the purgatory world instead of Nadia,"" was never able to completely let go of his flaws and mistakes (if you remember his conversation with Hurley)- and he'd always considered himself undeserving of her. I was impressed that without really noticing it, by the end of the Season 6 flash-""sideways,"" though, every character (except for Ben and possibly Sayid - which is fitting) were able to move past the worst parts of themselves in life; this, of course, because of the experiences they shared together and the ""place"" they created to find one another, love

The most important line of the episode, no do-overs. What happened, happened. All of this MATTERS."" 

The lack of detailed mythology explanation -- to me-- made the Island make more sense. The ""Magic Box"" Ben and Locke talked about early in the series was in reference to the Island's ability to make miraculous things happen--I think that was always the intended metaphor. A spinal surgeon falling from the sky when you're dying of spinal cancer... becoming inexplicably unable to die when something more important requires you to live... discovering the ability to walk when broken... unexpected family reunions or fateful showdowns with the past when needed... And so on.  

The ""heart of the Island"" was the most wonderfully understated, to make a place beyond the world and time and space and matter and even spirit where some could have happiness- those who were there to experience it firsthand, and those the Island chose. This is a character drama, a mystery, science fiction, and a fantasy- an element like this isn't out of place, and needs very little in the way of more explanation. I loved it. 

There was a lot I loved. It was Hurley- of COURSE it was Hurley. He was the only innocent- the only one who, and so did he. Much of the struggle between Jack, Locke, and Ben was about the question of leadership- and whether the best leaders are the ambitious who seek it at all costs, or those truly good souls who have leadership thrust upon them, and make the choice to accept it, even if reluctantly. 

I loved that Jacob and the Man in Black weren't Egyptian gods. They weren't good and evil incarnate. They were just guys. Powerful guys, just a couple of brothers. Flawed, broken brothers, whose mistakes had no easy fixes. No do-overs. All of this matters. 

I loved that Juliet's line ""it worked"" had nothing to do with the bomb- it was in reference to the vending machine. 

I loved the final scene between Jack and Christian. I loved the implications of the stained-glass window in the room with the coffin. I loved that there was no music during their conversation. I loved that even if at first, there was no other way it could have been, and I bought into it completely. Some tears were shed- of course they were- whether we wanted to or not, we were forced to say goodbye to everyone. ""Everyone dies sometime, kiddo."" If this wasn't gut-wrenching, we'd never cared about them in the first place. But it was, and we had. 

I loved the last lines between Ben and Locke. Everything that needed to be said was said. Locke, but as he said in Season One, he'd seen the heart of the island- and it was beautiful. At the end of the day, he was right- and his faith was justly rewarded. 

I loved the last lines between Hurley and Ben. No doubt it would have felt ""wrong"" to have Ben move along with everyone else- even in a place where time doesn't exist, to make his peace- or perhaps he just needed a little more time with Danielle and Alex, living in a peaceful world that, even if fabricated, was necessary.  

For the major unanswered questions, I could have done without some of the explanations they DID give- the ""whispers,"" for example, or Richard's entire ""Ab Aeterno"" episode- it was good, but added little to the overall experience. 

As for the untold stories that continued in ""the real world"" after Jack's death, or possibly centuries, after the Man in Black was destroyed. I wonder if Ben took MUCH longer to redeem himself after attempted power grabs and the temptation of falling back into his old scheming habits. I get to wonder what an elderly Richard was like, with his centuries of wisdom, trying to re-integrate with a world that's long passed him by. I can think about whether the Man in Black was lying to Jack and maybe our visions of Christian Shepard on and off the island WERE, indeed, Jack's father intervening from a previously unconsidered perspective. I can wonder how or if Desmond ever got home. I can consider the implications of newer threats to the island, Hurley having an existential crisis

And I can do that knowing that it can all fit.  

""There are no shortcuts, this is the voice of the writers. ""We know what we've given you is imperfect. We're storytellers around a campfire, and some of these things we came up with on the spot because we loved the look in your eyes as you sat on the edge of your seat and roasted marshmallows, and we got as caught up in its mystery as much as you did, hoping you were having as much fun listening as we were having telling it. We don't have the ability to go back and fix our mistakes, but if you've followed this long and cared about these characters along the way, even if it is flawed

**The island's purpose was, it appears that the light is what allows people to cross into the afterlife and so what they did on the island was important because it is what allowed  them to 'move on' at the end from the FS world.

**Jacob did have a plan.** Widmore really did talk to Jacob and bringing Desmond to the island was necessary to bring down MIB. Just like Sawyer had to unplug the vending machine to let the candy fall out and then plug it back in

Letting the characters have closure was important. It was necessary for us to feel like the story was over and this is what most people liked about the finale but it leads me to what was wrong about the finale.

**We watched the show because of the mysteries of the island.** I'm not using hyperbole when I say that every single person I talked to about the show thought that the flashbacks and character histories were the most boring parts of the show. I definitely cared deeply about the characters by the end and got very emotional seeing them reunited

**The show runners used a trick from BSG that pissed a lot of people off.** People had been saying for years that the island was purgatory and the creators vehemently denied it. So technically they were right in that the island wasn't but when people asked if the show was about purgatory they denied it this whole time so that at the end they could say ""Haha gotcha. It really was about purgatory."" On BSG they did the same thing by telling people that one planet was Earth so that at the end they could say another planet was Earth. It was lame then and it's lame now.

&gt;Chris: Hey Meg

&gt;Meg: I don't know... banana?

&gt;Chris: Aha

**Comparisons to Star Wars not explaining the force

Every now and then on this subreddit, let’s start a re-watch for real this time, and if people feel like participating, that will be great. Here is how it will work:

Next Tuesday (one week from now) I will make a post entitled “Lost Re-Watch Episode 1X01, one for each episode. In that post, I will link to the Lostpedia article on the episode and ask some generic questions, such as “How would you grade this episode?” “What is something you noticed this time that you didn't notice the first time (foreshadowing, continuity errors, etc.)?” “What was your favorite line from this episode?” “Was there anything you really disliked about this episode?” etc. People can answer those questions in the comments and hopefully that will lead to some good discussion.

A bunch of attempted re-watches failed after a few episodes or didn't even begin, more about just having a chance to discuss each episode individually. There are a lot of great episodes of Lost that we never really discuss, and I hope that this will help with that!

Feel free to tell me what you think of this. Even if you don’t think it will work, please let me know!

**Edit:** Alright, one on Mondays, one on Thursdays. Some people have suggested doing multiple episodes per post, but I think it would be best to stick to one per post. The reason I wanted to do this was because there are so many episodes we never discuss individually, and I'm pretty sure that if we discussed multiple episodes at a time, a lot of them would end up being ignored. Also, I will title the posts ""Episode Discussion 1X01, Part 1*,"" to emphasize the fact that this is about discussing episodes and not necessarily just re-watching them. We'll test this out and tweak it as needed. See you all on Monday!",t5_2qhag

- Everyone worked to save him from being trapped under the tree (instead of leaving him

- He got to stay on Island

- Hurley gave him that job because he really needed Ben's help, indicated a new era on Island was being ushered in.

- Ben said to Hurley that things can be done differently than how Jacob ran things. Ben has seen first hand the damage faith in Jacbo's rules could cause

- Hurley's said Ben was a great number two

If instead of just ending it at Season 6 (like they should have at the end of S7 in XF or the Office) they kept the show running, Claire, Sawyer, etc) while the main actors that wanted to move on (Locke, Jack, Kate), left the show and only came back as reoccurring characters on really important episodes like Duchovny did in XF S8 and 9.

Where do you think our characters would be for a plot two years later? Which questions would have been answered by now? Who would have been killed off? How many shitty characters like Paolo and Nikki would we be introduced to? Would LOST have it's own spin off or two by now? Different opening credits? Would you still watch the show at this point or would you have given up when the show eventually started sucking?

Just think if we had a Richard centric episode 2 seasons ago. A lot wouldn't make sense and it would also completely ruin the set up of other characters - mainly Jacob and MiB. Richard is a character who has a lot of dealings with some big answers, it does not flash between times due to the sheer volume of content, which I'de assume they've been itching to give us.

Would it have been nice to learn a bit more about Walt? Sure. Would it have been cool to know the true significance of the numbers? Hell yeah. But at the end of the day

It's now 5:26 am, watching this clip over and over again, with tears in my eyes. I don't cry very often. I cried when my best friend died a few years ago, but other than that I can't remember the last time I legitimately shed tears. Admittedly, I am drunk so that sort of enhances the emotions I'm feeling right now, but it also reveals an innate truth to them. This fucking show has changed my life. It has done things for me no therapist, no friend

Locke's pain in this season is almost impossible to watch. It's extraordinarily difficult to endure. Why? Because we all feel his pain in this moment. We ALL know what it's like to be completely and utterly confused and lost in life. No direction, everything spinning out of control. His frustration, anger, and sadness resonates so well with me that I literally struggle to watch this scene anymore (at least not without crying). Like I mentioned earlier, I'm in a pretty shitty place right now. I am not suicidal by any means but I am seriously having a hard time just getting by. This show is one of the ONLY things that keeps me grounded. It is one of the ONLY things that keeps me motivated.

I know it's silly to say this about a television show

At the end of the day

Anyone who has watched LOST in full knows what I'm talking about. Even the people who hated the ending. They can't deny it. They may never admit it publicly but they know in their heart of hearts what this show means to them. It is inspiring. It makes you want to get more out of life. It gives deeper meaning to the things you do care about. It forces you to look inwards to find your strengths and your weaknesses. It does so many things that a television show has no business doing. Television is supposed to entertain you. It's supposed to give you an escape to another world or reality where you don't have to confront the problems of your real life. While LOST certainly offers escapism

That's about all I've got. I hope I'm downvoted for this. I really don't care if nobody reads this and it falls off the front page quickly. That doesn't matter at all. I really just needed to get this off my chest. I needed to tell SOMEONE. My friends wouldn't understand. I do have a lot of friends who watched LOST, this post wouldn't have happened without the alcohol, but that doesn't mean that anything I have just said isn't true. It's all totally real. I am being as sincere as I possibly can. Truly. In the name of Jacob, I swear.

LOST changed my life. If you can't find the beauty in this show then...I don't know. Fuck you.

Namaste and good luck

TPaine

Mother had always wanted Nameless to become the protector of the Island (Smoke Monster) because she knew, you'll have to do bad things, like lie and kill, things we found out Jacob either can't or won't do.  When Nameless ran away, she was forced to manipulate things.  That's why she took Jacob to the Source that night.  To get into his head that the worst punishment of all would be to enter the cave of light.  Then, she told Jacob, falsely, in hopes

So, protector of the Island, and Jacob is the figurehead.  Which might be the system Mother had planned all along.

""But, quite simply, he followed the rules.  He stabbed her (maybe with a knife imbued with the magnetism of the Island) without letting her speak (or speaking to her).  That's how you take down Smokey.
