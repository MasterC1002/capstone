I did some digging and found their offices in California. The address is:  
Cartoon Network Studios  
300 N 3rd St.  
Burbank

After writing the whole thing I realized I didn't know who to actually send it to to read it. Took me a long time but I found out Jay Bastian is a production manager in charge of a bunch of shows

[Here's the letter I intend to send him.](http://i.imgur.com/QtwPbHT.png)

Someone from here emailed Wepolls and asked for any help we could give. We're fans of the show and we think using a poll is a great way to show interest in a Kickstarter. It's also not the first time people have used Wepolls in this way before. 

We're going to send your poll out in an email blast. We've tweeted it out to DC, and some fans. It's on our Facebook and our Google+. 

We'll need more votes than there are members here. I'd go for 10, Google+. Tweet it to big players. Retweet ours since they're already going to the big players. On Facebook post it to groups. Comic groups, video game groups, and on walls. On Google+ join communities and post it there. 

If you're posting the poll

What about Reddit?  Are there other subreddits were people wouldn't see voting in the Save YJ poll to be spam? If there are subs that would be sympathetic

It doesn't end there. Someone is going to need to step up and build a professional looking Save Young Justice website to organize from and plan email and social media bombs. You guys also need to figure our the names

Someone who's good at graphics should make wanted posters for Kid Flash, Superboy, et cetera, to spread around the internet. Reddit, Pinterest, Imgur, Instagram, Twitter. 

Most important thing right now is that someone build a website and go buy SaveYoungJustice.com for $10 because it's available right now. http://www.godaddy.com/domains/searchresults.aspx?ci=54814

Back in the day I was part of the Save Farscape campaign. We didn't get a 5th season

Wepolls isn't that big of a social network. But like I said

Divide your skills:

* writers 
* marketers 
* graphic designers 
* web developers 
* photographers 
* whatever else you need 

Be organized and win. ",self,t5_2t3l1,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/youngjustice/comments/1aixmn/so_you_want_to_help_save_the_show_huh/

SMGO. **Not going to happen**. Sorry. We'd all like to chase the dream

Objectively SMGO has probably done more to damage the Young Justice brand than it has helped it

YOUNG JUSTICE COMPANION COMIC BOOK 

* Issues #0-19 have all hit the stands and are available at comic shops or online.

* Issue #20 hits the stands this week. It's the start of a six-part story that is BIG. REALLY BIG. It updates the book, plus, by the end of the six-parter, a little story from immediately after Season One. Christopher Jones is just doing some stellar work on the book. And I'm pretty proud of the story and script, if I do say so myself.

* Issue #21 is being colored by Zac Atkinson as we speak.

* Issue #22 is being pencilled by Chris.

* Issues #23 &amp; #24 are both fully scripted and waiting.

* Issue #25 is plotted. I'll be starting on the script tonight.

The problem with the show is that it doesn't have the ratings and ad revenue to warrant its slot on saturday mornings. Adult Swim while they too need ratings and ad revenue

So we take Young justice a moderately grown up

So how do we do this? We need to mobilize! Any and all YJ fans you can find. Get on twitter, Toonami, and Adult Swim request pleading begging demanding young justice on adult swim: Toonami.

Recently I have been brainstorming. So what if we buy all the toys off the Mattel site? And most of us probably can't justify spending money on toys either.

So I started to think a bit bigger: Could we essentially run a toy drive  where we buy Young Justice toys for kids in hospitals

It's a different sort of *Young Justice* and if big enough could garner some media attention:&gt; Fans of Canceled Television Show Give to Charity to Show Support .
 It's also a different approach taken to saving a show which

The way I see it we would need:

* To gather the Facebook, Twitter and other Young Justice AND Green Lantern fan bases.
* Get in contact with a secure charity organization.
* Once in place get in contact with media. 

Anyone with knowledge on those things should speak up now.


Finally: I know it might be considered a shitty means to an end. We are only donating to get our show known about and it might also make sense to keep efforts coupled with informing about children in need.

This is only a very rough draft. More focus would be needed but I wanted your thoughts and input.

**Introduction**

I've been suggesting this in the comment sections for a while now

It all started with Fringe. The severely underrated show was in dire ratings territory during its final seasons

Why a new hashtag every week? Because Twitter's trending algorithms determine top trends by what is being talked about *right now* more than previously. Since we've used #SaveYoungJustice before

It caught the attention of Fox

---

**#JusticeIsOurs**

I'm open to debate as to what hashtags we should use

I want to test this strategy immediately

We will all begin tweeting simultaneously at **9:30 A.M. Eastern Time

---

**GUIDELINES**

1) **Don’t use #JusticeIsOurs before the designated time: 9:30 AM EST


2) **One # term per Tweet. Use only #JusticeIsOurs**

3) Lots of people tweeting matters more than the number of tweets.

Spread the word to all Young Justice fans. There is strength in numbers – remember that the more unique tweeters we have

4) Those with lots of followers help out a lot!

Let's see if we can get the show creators in on this

5) We want to pique the interest of non-YJ fans.

This is the key to our trending duration success. It gives a chance to get our message about YJ out to another audience. Try to construct a list of thoughtful and informative tweets before the event. These can be copied and pasted for easy tweets. Use some Young Justice quotes – link some of the official promo videos – speculate about the show.

6) We can discuss aspects of the show in our tweets.

TRY to include the title ""Young Justice"" (with no #) in your tweet if possible. Talk about the characters and the actors.

7) **Private accounts must have their locked status removed

8) **Retweets are the easiest way to help out the trending effort.**

Just search for the hashtag

Whew. Everyone still with me? Trust me

Secondly, but I suppose this isn't the comics and names are flexible).

Ok, who reveal that since Jaime Reyes isn't going to co-operate, they'll have to ""reboot"" the scarab by putting it onto a new host.  Black Beetle is also there and whole-heartedly agrees that this is the right thing to do.

The Team isn't helpless through all of this, and Bumblebee get captured, and follow them to the ship holding Impulse, Beast Boy, Blue, and a number of teenage civilians hostage, and start freeing them.  

However, Superboy, and Miss Martian put together, and even Blue at full strength can't do anything other than fight him evenly.  They eventually tear a hole in the ship, allowing the team and the civilians to escape to the surface.

However, not even the team, seems to know about.

One question seems to be natural after watching this episode: why would the Light want to partner with these aliens?  They all seem to be playing for the Earth Home Team

Seeing that Blue Beetle is the evil Impulse was sent back in time to prevent puts a whole new spin on knowing that Impulse failed to save the future

In my view:

* Best moment of the episode - one of Aqualad's ""soldiers"" suddenly beating up Tigress and several other mooks before revealing himself to be Superboy in disguise.
* Saddest moment of the episode: Miss Martian looking through Aqualad's brain and seeing

---

Remember in the season one finale when Vandal Savage and Clarion the Witch Boy took total control of the Justice League and the Watchtower? **NO

Those geniuses spent a whole season trying to take over the Justice League and in a single episode they lose? After all the tricks they pulled in other episodes

**The whole point of Vandal Savage’s plan was to get those six members off-world for 16 hours.** (Batman, Martian Manhunter, Superman, and Wonder Woman) The faces of the Justice League, the most powerful members, are criminals because of those 16 hours and are removed from Earth in season 2. Savage’s goal was to get the Justice League off Earth for season 2.

Look at the members of The Light, the most powerful industrialist on the planet, the strongest evil sorcerer, the genius brain, the woman who can control world leaders and the dark king of the ocean. When working together, they have the perfect skill set to take over the world. But they are all “the bad guys”, and are known for not getting along since they all want to be in charge. **The odds of The Light gathering together willing on their own are beyond slim.** These people didn’t make The Light, each member has something *He* wants.

And in season 2, an army building.

Two alien races are causing a power struggle between themselves

The Reach is developing a juice that can enslave mankind

The Reach is trying to isolate the Meta-gene to weaponize it.

**Who would benefit most from all this chaos?** In whose best interest would it be to get Superman off Earth? Who would get something from the enslavement of mankind but not benefit from killing them off and who would have a need for a Meta-human army?

They call themselves The Light, that chaos makes sense. They see the Light at the end of the Boom Tube and they know who is in charge, who can use their skills and make them Gods.

So please join us Sunday March 10th at 5pm EST/4pm CST for an AMA with these two talented and comic book artists! What follows is some stuff you should keep in mind
----

First: Etiquette!

**PLEASE


They do art for the comic and therefore have no input on the sudden issues we are having with the tv show. 


Please also keep in mind that they are doing **US** a favor by doing this AMA, we want them to feel welcome and not put off by our community (think more of /r/community ama’s and less rampart). 

----

Second: How this will work


Chris’s Reddit Handle: ChristopherJonesArt


Zac’s Reddit Handle: ZacAtkinson


----

Since we have 2 people for 1 AMA we will have Chris post it and both he and Zac will answer within as two separate users. 




Within the post when you write your question or comment format it in this way: 


@Chris:


Blah blah ART AND STUFF!


@Zac:


Blah blah Did you watch transformers as a kid?


And they will try to respond.


Also inorder to further establish that they are answering pay attention to their custom text flair

wassup guys and of course gals its your friendly neighborhood wisesonAC bringing your a little some some you know that spark(i hope) in any case this is the ""young justice 30 day challenge"" something interesting i found people were doing with other things shows etc. i think the original comes from tumblr. but i digress. 

the basics-its a thing that happens over the course of thirty days.you answer one question per day. i figure it would be fun and get everyone involved.today(night) is day 1 for me.(i figure everyone can do theirs in the comments and update daily(miss a day no worries just make up for lost time).) also be as detailed as you want. :-) no worries. i also thought it would be a fun for everyone to compare notes and keep discussion fresh(somewhat)

Day 1. How you found out about Young Justice?-i found out by promos hear say and me basically googleing(spelling?) all the info i could. the show sounded amazing on paper. and it looked beautiful too.

Day 2. thoughts on the season 2.5 trailer recently released.- man it was epic! Static

Day 3. Favorite villain and why?-honestly ill go with black manta. he seems like he is gonna play a bigger role in coming episodes. he is intelligent,and he just joined the light. he will be a force to be reckoned with.

Day 4. Least favorite villain and why?- i never really cared for ultra-humanite

Day 5. Favorite male character and why?- that would have to be Aqualad for a few simple reasons, a good leader, very perceptive, has unique and useful weapons and is just an all around bad ass. 

Day 6. Favorite female character and why?-rocket;for many reasons explained [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/youngjustice/comments/tiyk0/my_fellow_redditors_gather_around_boys_and_girls/)

Day 7. Least favorite character and why?-lagoon boy. honestly seemed like an asshole. not the lovable woleverine asshole the annoying water based bad catchphrase having  asshole.

Day 8. Best mentor and why?(EX. Aquaman, Martian Manhunter,Icon etc.) favorite mentor icon but best would have to be well batman. he atleast somewhat respects the teams space.hes not overbearing he  lets them figure things out on their own.which is sometimes what  kids need. plus he's fucking batman.

Day 9. Worst mentor and why?(EX. Aquaman, Martian Manhunter Icon etc.) none are bad perse just not as good as others. i vote for aquaman. nothing person just wish he would have been honest with aqualad.but overall i guess he's a pretty good mentor.

Day 10. Best friendship and why? gotta god with the friendship between wally and dick.they seem to know alot about each others past,and just seem to have real good chemistry. all that equals to a great friendship.

Day 11. Superpower/skill you’d want and why? i would to have a powerset like [Idie Okonkwo aka Oya](http://worldofblackheroes.com/2010/10/06/idie-okonkwo-oya/) Idie is a high level thermo-kinetic mutant able to generate both heat and cold from her body. Not only can she generate Ice and fire but also control their shape and intensity she is also immune to temperature extremes. that just screames bad ass. look [here](http://worldofblackheroes.files.wordpress.com/2010/10/oya7.jpg)

Day 12. Favorite ship and why? id have to  say wally and artemis. it was just a long time coming. through out season 1 they really teased it and it warmed up to me. plus i think artemis will straighten wally out.

Day 13. Least favorite ship and why? lagoon boy and megan. honestly lagoon boy is a douche.

Day 14. Favorite from the Justice League team and why? icon.he's black, alien who crash landed in the southern usa circa 1839 and lived thtough slavery harlem Renaissance great depression and so many other historical events. and he can go toe to toe with superman need i say more?

Day 15. Least favorite from the Justice League team and why? hmm honestly i didnt really dislike anyone.

Day 16. Robin or Aqualad as leader and why? aqualad because even though he wasnt groomed to be leader since age 9(robin) he is very capable of making sure the mission gets done.

Day 17. Favorite quote ""youre overwhelmed freeze was underwhelmed what isnt anyone just whelmed?"" -robin

Day 18. Favorite Superboy/Miss Martian moment-when superboy accepted her appearance even though she was really scared of the reaction. i found it really touching.

Day 19. Funniest moment-i remember when Artemis made some jokes about alomst drowing like twice that was pretty funny.

Day 20. A mentor and protege you’d want to spend the day with and why?robin and batman. because hes fuckin batman. and just spending time with them would teach alot to anybody.

Day 21. Favourite “Red” tornado hands down. but firebrand was pretty cool.

Day 22. Favorite episode and why? the episode where all the adults disappear. great episode that took place on my birthday! nov 5th.

Day 23. Favorite mentor/protoge relationship and why?i really like batman and robins relationship. its really unique. bruce cheered robin up by playing basketball with him. among other things. its just really really cool.

Day 24. Thoughts on episode 207 ""Depths"" its a great set-up for whats to come.and i love the twist at the end.

Day 25. Who you want to see more of on the show. rocket hands down!

Day 26. Explain your thoughts about the show in general-i feel its  a very diverse and unique show that shows great stories, its funny and just all around amazing. something tv needs.

Day 27. Are you a villain or a superhero and why. probably a villain. because powers corrupt everybody. and im only human. plus i could chill all day no need to rush out at all hours of the day like heroes. ill be sensible lol

Day 28. Any character you’d want to be- mos def Aqualad. the triple C Kal'dur who leads the team

Day 29. Any changes you’d make to the show-

* make it an hour long. this way we can have more character developent


* honestly i  cant really think of anything else. well maybe more milestone.thats just me.

Day 30. Who you’d add to the show-wow man i could write a moutain about this. i'd only add characters if they actually get used to their potential that being said [heres](http://www.reddit.com/r/youngjustice/comments/ugqmd/if_you_could_add_one_member_to_the_team_who_would/) my answer.",self,t5_2t3l1,1344359406.0,,Milestone,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/youngjustice/comments/woksv/official_mod_post_hey_you_yes_you_no_more_lurking/

/r/YoungJustice Community Comics!",18,70,http://www.reddit.com/r/youngjustice/comments/1aeq02/ryoungjustice_is_happy_to_unveil_our_secret/,"The beginning and the end, alpha and omega, like everything else in life all good stories have a beginning and an end. Sometimes stories and worlds die all too soon (Firefly) and other times they hang on by a single tread slowly and painfully writhing into its own death (The Office). And even though Cartoon Network, and Time Warner have all decided to abandon Young Justice there is no reason why we should at all. The simple fact of the matter is no matter what happens, a little spit ball of an idea


We are going to be writing our own comic

So now what is this? What does all of this mean?

Simple. We can tell any story we want. We can use any character we want. We can do whatever we want. But we need the community to participate in order for this to work.
Now this isn’t a contest. There is no singular winner

Here is the basic format of how this works:

&gt;Week 1: Story

&gt;Week 2: Art (by the community for the story from Week 1)

&gt;Week 3: Story part 2

&gt;Week 4: Art (by the community for the story from Week 3)

&gt;Rinse and repeat until the story is finished. 

We will decide on an arc and start writing for it.

At the start of an arc we (the mods) will post a short paragraph introducing the story that we will write about

Next is where you guys come in.  Your job for week one is to fill in what happens in between those two events.

We will then compose the story you decided on and wrote and post the final product of week 1 on the following week for people to draw art for.

Now I know that may seem daunting but I want to assure you guys that I am not asking you all to write a full story by yourselves or draw an entire page by yourselves. For the story all you have to do is contribute “Oh he should drop down from the rafters here

Any work
 
Now I know this sounds like fan-fiction but the thing about fan-fiction is that is very hit and miss. Not a lot of people will enjoy fan-fiction while others do. Unfortunately I am in the former of that group; I personally can’t bring myself to read any fan-fiction. So I don’t want this to turn into a fan-fiction like project. I don’t want users to write huge blocks of text
 
So this week we since we have this announcement and the final episode of this season debuting we will start this bright and early next Saturday! And just a little teaser for you guys

Forget my last post, even a new series can bring back our beloved characters. 

I understand if you are getting through the stages of grief

We have a couple routes to go at the moment that we can campaign for. We can pitch WB ideas for new series taking place on our beloved Earth 16. Justice League, but get someone's creative juices flowing. Then, hopefully, we get a great dark gritty show in 2014 that can have a good toy line (I know... The whole toy line thing... But it's really the only way to keep the show going) 

We can contact their animated movie division to get at least one movie to tie up Darksied. To me

We can try to revive the companion comic. This to me is the least realistic thing we can do

We can also cross our fingers and hope for a place in the 2014 lineup. This is what I want the most. Contrary to popular belief

Finally

This small defeat isn't the end of our fight,False,self,t5_2t3l1,False,,Superboy,t3_1dni4e

**INFO**    **ROCKET**                 
firstly, most crime-ridden neighborhood in [Dakota](http://dc.wikia.com/wiki/Dakota_City). rocket is such a believable character for many reasons. firstly, because She yearned to become a writer (""just like Toni Morrison""), but lacked the motivation. That is, until she met Augustus Freeman IV AKA Icon, a alien that has been stranded on earth since 1839. also rocket was comics first teenage mother superhero! it addressed an issue that was prevalent in America and still is. you see Shortly after she began adventuring with Icon, Raquel discovered that she was pregnant by her ex-boyfriend.She decided to keep the baby. She gave birth to a son, and ""Augustus"" after Icon's human alias.also her pregnancy caused her to give up being a super hero for a time.she eventually took the mantle again.also

**INFO** **Mal Duncan**                                               
Mal is  pretty new character to most people. but believe it or not he was created in 1970. he was a member of the teen titans and the dune patrol. and as we all know he is currently a member of yj.  Malcolm Duncan was the wielder of the Gabriel Horn.and in the comics his wife is Bumblebee.i personally think the way he originally joined teen titans was really cool he  saved the Teen Titans from a street gang called the Hell Hawks by beating their leader in a [boxing match!](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-aRlsFLu0MA8/TWEXmP1klPI/AAAAAAAAE20/aJMeXJfQFzg/s1600/Teen+Titans+26-21.jpg) Also in the comics He is an accomplished jazz musician and owns a nightclub named [heralds horn!](http://www.titanstower.com/assets/whos%20who/_whos_80s/Herald_whos_80s.jpg). During the JLA/Titans event, and briefly joins the short-lived Titans LA. In the Titans Tomorrow storyline, the Mal of the alternate future becomes president of the Eastern United States! And last time i checked like a year after the events in Infinite Crisis(could be more), Mal has joined the Doom Patrol alongside his wife Bumblebee. he goes by vox at this point.Mal speaks with a synthesized voice box which can create sonic blasts and open dimensional portals similar to the Gabriel Horn.

When the mystic scarab of the Blue Beetle landed in El Paso, he found the strange bug-like artifact. That night, the fabled scarab found a new symbiotic host by fusing to Jaime's [spine](http://www.titanstower.com/assets/whos%20who/aapanels/teentitans3OYL/BlueBeetle_IC5a.jpg). Jaime awoke babbling alien languages and hearing unintelligible communications from the scarab. It was trying to tell him that whenever he faced danger, the scarab would expand to create a super-powered carapace(armor) around his body he even joined the [teen titans!](http://www.titanstower.com/assets/whos%20who/aapanels/teentitans3OYL/bluebeetlejoin_tt61.jpg)!.personally i love blue beetle as a character. he's cool humorous has a unique skill set. i also love the fact that he is Mexican American. its always a good thing when dc gets diverse with their characters.

Dick Grayson started off in season 1 as the experienced crime fighter but woefully unprepared for leadership Robin. He, loves to laugh as he disappears and hacks computers, and he has a very good skill set. 

We got to see some real touching moments from him, we learned that he didn't trust everyone, not even Batman.

In season two, and in the show that he was willing to go to extreme lengths for the mission, including not telling his friends and teammates about Aqualad and Artemis's undercover work.

He didn't get as much development in season two due to all of the new characters. It was interesting to see how he gave the leadership of the Team back to Aqualad after wanting it so much in season one. It was also interesting to learn that his not wanting to be Batman extended to not wanting to be a hero

Perhaps one of the most interesting things was his refusal to join the Justice League, that's why they learned of Superboy.

TLDR; The DCAU was awesome but it was lacking in the level of crossover/expansiveness and more serious stories later on.

So, and the makings of a Red Hood Outlaw's gang. We have several villain groups, political opposition and the seamless crossover of basically every major DC superhero. But it is one show, and it seems like a missed opportunity to not do more. We all loved that Justice League voting scene. It's clear this league is more complex and more mature than the DCAU one.

Anyhow it is clear that even though there is a lot of acclaim for the YJ things are looking grim because of poor merchandise sales which is a key part to children's television. 

So on top of tweeting @cartoonnetwork with the #saveyoungjustice we should support the show in other ways. 

Buy episodes on iTunes and [Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/Independence-Day-Part-1/dp/B004IDISOK/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1350249565&amp;sr=8-3&amp;keywords=young+justice)

And of course when YJ: Legacy is released consider purchasing a copy. It may be the last original story content we get regardless.

I know spending money isn't very exciting but I know personally I rarely watch episodes live and honestly haven't spent a cent that would help support the show. CN needs to see revenue before they continue this. 

The hiatus might be helpful if we can use the extra time before the season ends to show interest.

This particular sub doesn't show up often on my front page

Anyway, or possibly at all, holds many possibilities.  
There is of course the Light's deal with Darkseid
There is the growth and development of many of the season two characters that didn't get much attention due to the number of them.  
And there is the introduction of new characters/returning characters.

Let's look at what we can assume:  
*There will be another time-skip. Not really necessary

*Nightwing will not be an active hero, I'd like to see him as a cop, that would be cool.  

*The Flash will be thinking of retirement. After all, at least for a while. This will probably upset Impulse/NKF  

*Let's see some development of those characters shall we? With the original sidekicks all grown up, Cassie and Wonder Woman.  

*And of course
second thought

Now
*The Red Hood. What better way to get Dick back into the costume than a new villain that is targeting him and the rest of the Batkids and seems to know who they are? This would also be a good way to transition the Batgirls, you'll know what I'm talking about.  
That was a long one.  

*I would also love to see the return of Wally West. Now, suddenly to return and dressed in a different Flash costume. He could have been sent to an alternate timeline for the last five years and joined their Justice League while trying to find his way back home. Obviously he was super-charged by the Speed Force and is now the Fastest Man Alive, and ready to take his Uncle's place. The Team and the League, dealing with the return of other previously thought dead heroes, would no doubt be untrusting of him. Eventually he would prove himself though.  

*Some femme fatale development. I would like to see Cassie more fully developed, these three are some of my favorite female teens from the comics, they need to be introduced and developed. I would really like to see Cassie get more comfortable and take on a leadership role like she held in the Titans. And more Zatanna!  
Some more Justice League time. With some of the original Team joining the League at this time, and lots of crossovers.

I can't think of anything else right now

1362898782.0,1a0iwn,[Hypothetical Situation] An animated movie and a Bat-family series set in the same universe,jade-E,18,1,8,"How would you guys feel about this: 

Due to fan outcry Warner Brothers realizes that there is high demand for a continuation of the Young Justice series. The ""Beware the Batman"" program does not fare nearly as well as YJ did--but they both were lacking something for WB: numbers. Merchandise numbers for the Young Justice show--and viewer numbers for the Beware the Batman show. 

So Warner Bros decides to return to the YJ Earth 16 for television

But WB knows it cannot return to animating Earth-16 without wrapping up the Light story--the fans simply wouldn't have it and they're banking on bringing in the fanbase to help sustain the new show. So they make a DC Animated Feature called Young Justice: The Light or something that would give closure to the story. Perhaps even do a two-part feature like they did with The Dark Knight Returns

With that wrapped up they pull in this new series: ""Batman: Incorporated."" In the past year or two in the comics, Gotham is under the watch of Dick Grayson (Nightwing), Batgirl, and Damian Wayne (Robin); he also sends Tim Drake (Red Robin) with his own team, The Outsiders, to do covert ops like YJ functions in the animated series. 

This leaves the show with three intertwining story-lines; similar to the multiple ones YJ juggles. 

1. We get to see Batman team up with various heroes around the globe in the vain of ""The Brave and The Bold

2. We see Dick and Damian (along with whomever else happens to be in town) solve crimes in Gotham for more traditional styled Batman stories. 

3. We see Tim Drake lead his Outsiders team (who could very well have members of Young Justice

This also allows for more exploration into certain Batman stories (like the Hush arc or even Batman's death and Dick taking up the mantle) and introduce members of the Bat-Family (like Damian Wayne

So Warner Bros gets both its viewers and merchandise. Would you be interested in this at all?",self,t5_2t3l1,False,,Robin,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/youngjustice/comments/1a0iwn/hypothetical_situation_an_animated_movie_and_a/

Firstly

Evidence: We know that there are two histories of the Reach Apocalypse: the one that Impulse came back to avert (`T1`) and the one that is “currently” playing out (`T2`).  In `T1`

Secondly, not merely homicidal ones.  So right up until the instant before the “successful” reboot, the scarab would have been fighting for its life, just as we witnessed in “Darkest”, “Before Dawn”, and the beginning of “True Colors”. I predict that it manages to subvert the Reach’s influence in some manner similar to Red Tornado’s trick for Starro-tech.

1) He is becoming much more powerful than the rest of the team as shown by ""War"". There's no tension if one guy is much better than the rest.

2) I don't think he will be able to get the Scarab back to the way it was and if he cant it removes what was interesting about his character essentially just pushing him into the background

3) When they defeat the Reach his arc will most likely be tied up. They could have been planning to start a new arc with him next season but with another time skip and many new characters (and old ones we know nothing about) it would be foolish. But he cant just be pushed off to the side because of how important he has been. It would be like Wally all over again.

4) He is going to feel terrible when he gains control again and the easiest way to redeem himself is self sacrifice to bring down The Reach.

If Nightwing was going in order

So who was Delta Squad and Epsilon Squad if all team members were accounted for on Alpha, and Zeta?

I think this might have been a small foreshadowing of Aqualad's role in this season's story arc.  And possibly another secret mission Nightwing might be directing.

It's really cool that some of the lessor known characters are getting put in the spotlight.                                              

And now on to the bad: some of the character development for some of the lesser known characters is lacking in my opinion.  Prime example is rocket.  A really cool character who hasn't been used to her potential. Would go into detail but you know would go off on a tangent.  Next thing is.... Wow i can't really think of too many things I don't like about the show... Wait lagoon boy...  There we go those are my few gripes and grievances.                                   

And lastly I what I would change I would just make the show an hour long show.   I think it would be great for the ability to have character development and be able to do alot more with the show.

Watching some of my favorite episodes, its substance, can only be fully appreciated by people who grew up on DC. Many things go unsaid, some of which it seems like they are saying ""this is a detail from the comics that carries over to Young Justice"" without saying anything at all. The show is full of Cameos, all of which we would love to see expanded because we know who they are, but that's all lost on new viewers.

Another interesting thing I noticed, except for the fact that the Reach ambassador, the Reach's representative and de facto man in charge ordered Black Beetle to save them. If Black Beetle were indeed on mode, surely he would have done as ordered and saved the ambassador and the scientist without question. But the fact that Black Beetle was able to refuse and even cite Reach protocol leads me to believe that he is indeed able to act autonomously of the Reach and perhaps even fooled the Reach ambassador and scientists into thinking he is ""on-mode"".

If this is true, but because he may be ""off-mode"" he is willing to take those steps and do so without the Reach or anyone stopping him from doing so.

I take this evidence from how we've seen the Reach interact with Blue Beetle. One could argue that the Reach allow more autonomy to those scarab infused servants that have been in the fold for some time. I could accept that as a valid argument

All hope isn't lost though, although some are probably subscribed to both this one and Green Lantern as well, that brings the total number of Redditors to 17,964. So now, each person only has to shell out $556.67, which is a much more reasonable, although impossible amount since not every person will want to or can donate that much. 

At our best, which means that each person needs to donate $500, which I'm willing to bet will never happen. Of course, there are other outside sources of funding such as those people on Tumblr, DeviantArt, etc. that would be willing to chip in but we won't get that unless there is an active effort. 
This post is in no way a post to demotivate anyone from donating. It is only here to bring a little realism and reality to the scene. If we can raise that money, but may just close it after that season no matter how successful it was. 

A couple baseline things to cover if you do decide to fight for the show.

1) Don't stop: Once you start, social loafing just makes the whole system come down.

2) Be polite: This should go without saying. I know we all get mad at TTG and Beware the Batman (BTB?) but there is no reason to curse them out or just be rude. No one wants to debate with someone who is being rude and being rude will not help us get our goal, hate filled email/tweet/whatever-cool-people-use because it will not be received well. Be respectful

3) Organize: Don't do this alone. We have a great community here with great mods who can lead us to do great things. If you want to send emails or tweets in a spam form, but also get others to help. We should plan a day where we all just simply continue to spam one inbox or account to lower the bar they want for a new season. 10 million is simply an impossible amount that they want to deter us. But if we organize and set up a better relationship between us all, we can get this done as a team. In fact, we can be The Team.

Honestly YJ and these shows were what I looked forward to most to watch in the past couple of years. Both fan bases grew than expected.

MLP: FIM was intentionally for a younger audience but got the attention of a demographic beyond the age group and came on early mornings on a channel that most people don't have. 

Avatar: LOK was supposed to be a miniseries but due to a wide number of audience

Is there something that we're not doing that these shows have? I know some will have preferences over others but I love all of these shows and I'm of the older demographic and Im sure there are plenty others like me too. I'm sure fans of the other shows would enjoy YJ and GL for many reasons:

Good storyline and episodes, and many Voice Actors are getting recognition that some of the fans love ex: [Grey Deleslie](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0217221/), [Mae Whitman] (http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0926165/), etc.

Hear me out on this. What if Cartoon Network is smarter than we are all thinking right now?

Think about it. This is the perfect way to see just how popular that block really is. The phrase “You don’t know what you’ve got til it’s gone” comes to mind.

My thought process is this (and this is purely speculative):

* CN started this block back in March with only two shows and some shorts

* CN didn’t know just how popular this block was going to end up being

* CN might have had some discussion as to whether they should continue

* CN said they would add two new shows to the block

* CN was debating how many episodes to order of the new shows

* CN wasn’t sure just how strong the fandom was for their block

* CN abruptly pulls DC Nation to figure it out


It’s really a brilliant publicity move here. Sure

Because nothing can stop the strength of a fandom. ",self,t5_2t3l1,False,,Nightwing,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/youngjustice/comments/11foif/this_new_hiatus_could_be_a_good_thinghear_me_out/

Firstly

**BASIC INFORMATION**                                                          
For my pick i feel compelled to go with my username namesake [Wiseson](http://www.comicvine.com/wise-son/29-59910/all-images/108-213183/wise_son/105-702638/).I linked a picture for people who haven't seen(or heard of him before)his real name is Hannibal White. he is 18-19 years old in the comics.I believe he is a good fit for yj in many ways.He is a natural born leader(in fact he is the second Leader of the [Blood Syndicate](http://www.comicvine.com/blood-syndicate/65-44509/all-images/108-195884/blood_syndicate/105-1172282/)).Admittly

**POWERS**                                                                            
his skin is made up of an ultra-dense molecular structure, beyond the reach of physical harm.And to a degree super strength. He can still be stunned or knocked unconscious (as demonstrated in his fight with Icon), though this requires quite a bit of effort.Also he discovered in the latter part of his career that he could also temporarily bestow some of his protective powers upon others while touching them. i think that if he joined yj he would be a powerhouse of the team.Who would immediately contribute.                                                                                               

**HISTORY**                                                                                                  

Wise Son is a Bang Baby, most of those exposed to the tear gas died, and the handful of surviving gang members that lived had all developed superhuman abilities.   

One of the Bang Babies, the Blood Syndicate, with the aim of achieving substantive positive social change. They took over an abandoned door factory, which they simply dubbed The Factory. Operating from The Factory, the Blood Syndicate smashed crack houses throughout Paris Island, trying to rid the neighborhood of the dealers while taking the money captured in these operations to fund their activities. In the course of their work they would acquire new members, and put an end to many threats in Paris Island.

Wise Son assumed leadership of the Blood Syndicate after the death of Tech-9, and became an active influence in the community as a whole ; he was even able to stop a riot during the Utopia Park project by speaking to the crowd. to quote him ""We are men and women. The most powerful, beautiful, most intelligent creatures on the planet...in life itself...despite what we believe of ourselves sometimes."" (...) ""We can't let this anger...this outrage get the best of us. We can't let anyone else get hurt now. Because we are human...because we are men and women. We have to stop.""                                                                                             

**PERSONALITY**                                                                                            

Wise Son *was* a very angry man : angry with the injustices of American society, but only followed the trappings and eschewed the actual teachings and lifestyle. During his time with the Blood Syndicate Wise Son has matured a great deal, learning to deal with his emotions more rationally and embracing Islam as an uplifting influence instead of simply paying it lip service. Wise Son has become a very inspirational person, and was actually able to quell a riot by addressing the crowd, as i stated earlier.

A similar progression of maturity can also be seen in Wise Son's personal life. Initially he was a self-serving misogynist who actively avoided responsibility toward the others in his life. The events of the Blood Syndicate series and even more notably the Wise Son: White Wolf mini-series made him rethink his priorities. Wise Son consequently became more actively involved with the lives of his family

**CLOSING COMMENTS**                                                                                   

i honestly feel that Wiseson would be a good fit for yj. of course they will have change somethings about his back story.that comes without saying. (hell it was the 90's superman had a mullet.) lol things change.Wiseson is a very unique individual,and i believe if given a chance he could become a fan favorite.

Okay so here it goes
Here are the bullet points of my life from when I had to disappear:

* School and Finals


* The Coma following Finals Week


* Family Relations

* *Personal* Relations

* Work


And here we go.

----


**School**

So as you know my school life is hectic

My finals themselves were brutal they were three days of nonstop torture and trying to stay awake. I had one final in particular that I was really honest to god worried about (to be completely honest I did not do all that great in) and so I had to really maximize my study time. 

Now right before I could leave I had to take care of a few errands, filling paperwork, good byes, the usual stuff. 

Fast forward 2 months (and then back 4). Since I was finishing my second year I got to finally declare my major (which is when you say what you officially studying and apply for entrance into your colleges school of X [also let’s be honest I would love to be a mutant, the department head and so on. So they helped me schedule my classes and plan out the last 2 years of my bachelors. Now here’s where we flash forward; the majors that I decided upon with the so called professionals apparently no longer exists. That’s right my major and all my classes as well as everything I've been doing has been for naught. So what happened was that I got a letter in the mail saying something along the lines of:

&gt;Oh hey there we notice that you are in this major

Which lead to the past 3 weeks of being on the phone for hours on end trying to get this sorted out. Brightside ive read 3 books during the entire time I've been on hold. 

----

**Coma**

This one is pretty self-explanatory after finals and packing and paperwork when I finally got home I feel into a near coma like state and slept for what seemed like a week. 

----

**Family**

So the only thing that disrupted my coma like state is my family. Now at first glance that may seem like an adorable concept but let me reassure you I was not a happy monkey.  We had our yearly family reunion and being an Italian… well lets just say that it was a weeklong process, preparing; it was grueling. 

----

**Personal Relationships**

So some good news from my disappearance is that a week before finals week I started dating a wonderful girl. The week before finals they offered a trip up to New York for free and I took the opportunity to take a girl I knew up there out for a date, followed up by watching the sun set and then the night at her place. Great girl. I actually knew her from back in high school, we were cool and all but we never really ran in the same circles, when out of the blue last year she got in touch with me and we started talking. Turns out she moved to the city was in school for business while in her free time was a model. So this was uh pretty big for me and I wanted to make it work so after school, after my coma, and after my family event I would spend every other day commuting from PA to NY (this average commute was about 3 hours) most trips I would often spend the night and leave the following night.  This took up a huge portion of my free time and for the past 2 months cost me *a lot* of money. 

----


**Work**

So since school is out and whatnot I once again started up my job (I worked every now and then when I was at school but for the most part a 4-5 hour commute for work is well a lot and costs more to drive there then what I was being paid. 

So now I was working every other day (week days from 7am until 8:30pm and weekends from 5am until 6:30pm) Now I was working 4 days a week traveling to NJ from PA just for work (about a 2 hour commute with traffic) and then visiting my girlfriend 3 days a week traveling from PA to NY (about a 3 hour trip every other day and one time it was 5 hours since traffic). That was what my week looked like for about 2 months, traffic, code compiling, and a passing comment here and there. 

Following all of this I actually ended up getting my third promotion at my job

As you can see work has pretty much been dominating my life. 

----

I had originally wrote a lot more touching on my various health and bodily issues as well as going more in depth on my family events  but after thinking about it I decided to take it out. If you guys have any more questions feel free to ask. 

Listen I know that I let you guys down and I cant say sorry enough

Now to close off: Community Comics. We have a lot to discuss. Expect a separate discussion post tomorrow. 

Also good news for you guys

Hello ladies and gentlemen! We are proud to present you all with our completed story for week 1! Now that we have chapter one finished it is time to start our first art week for our project!

 

Here is how this works is below is the story for week one you all have a week to submit and create art to go along with the story thus far. You will use the character designs that have already been established (such as Nightwings outfit in the present time) and designs designed by our lovely user /u/GoldandBlue for creating our custom designs that haven’t been in featured in the show.

 

You guys have a week so don’t rush and take your time. **ALSO REMEMBER** there is no bad art! I (Shiniholum) will be submitting a very crappy ms paint submission. Its more about just doing what you can. Talk to other people and communicate! Also remember you **do not** need to create an entire page of art if you dont want to

 





----

 

The characters involved are **Dick, and Jason (as robin)**. Since the first week deals with primarily a flash back we haven’t been introduced to Jason as The Red Hood nor has he died yet.

 

Here is what Jason looks like: [Jason as Robin]( http://imgur.com/AGvC38w) courtesy of the show

 

And here is what Dick looks like: [Dick as Nightwing early days]( http://jasonh537.deviantart.com/art/Young-Justice-Nightwing-Discowing-Version-360162785) courtesy of /u/GoldandBlue

 

Now the reason why we chose to use Dick’s DiscoDick original Nightwing outfit is because we wanted to bring it into the show and since this flash back happens a month or so after Dick left the mantle of Robin he just wanted a sense of “freedom.”

 

You guys shouldn’t have to worry about any of this yet because **this week is just for the first chapter**

1364656483.0,1bayzf,Congratulations! You just got put in charge of the story ark for season three. How do you do it?,offdachain,15,5,18,"No limitations. You don't have to follow the things like season 3 will revolve around magic or any other limitations.

For me

Slowly tensions rise through the season with filler episodes mostly about The Team, it's to start a revolution. The revolt is about if Earth should start playing a bigger role in the rest of the Galaxy. But Darkseid isn't leading either sides, he is just egging them on and profiting from the new Civil War.

Heros and villains are split down the middle. The Team splits down the middle and forms two new teams. Slowly as tensions rise. We get more and more intense battles from both sides. We see fights like Artimas Vs Nightwing, Batman Vs Superman, etc.

But as tensions rise Darkseid's true intentions come into place. He wants the Earth to be split so he can lead a secretive envision. He wants to infiltrate the Earth

One of the teams is lead by Red Hood, Dick and Jason get surrounded. They get an enemy of my enemy thing going and we see the most badasses fight ever. They work together perfectly. But then we hear a blaster go off pointed at Nightwing. It goes into slow motion. It shows a memory shown in the first episode of when they first met. Jason dives to protect Dick. The Red Hood has fallen.

It goes back to the Leagues fighting over the war in their last battle in the war. Soon, the teams just saved the day. The crowds around the battle weren't cheering for them, they were cheering the war world was finally destroyed.

But the finally of the season isn't over. It shows the screens the Light uses to communicate. It slowly pans to someone. It's Jason in his full Red Hood outfit. ""Everything went according to plan"" Cut to black.

Season 2 on the other hand was kind of wack to begin with. First off this is 5 years after the events of season one. Why? I just spent a season getting to know and care about a cast of, and I do until the ""hiatus"" in december. 

Every episode since the return in january has been awful. The characters have no consistant character traits and way too much time is spent with characters that are boring and by this late in the season are unimportant to the plot. 

These opinions being stated and now i'm left thinking that if the 5 year gap between seasons had been filled in some way. Be it a season of one off episodes with day to day teenage superhero situations which would lead into the events of season 2. Or what I was expecting to happen this season

I love, nightwing, kid flash, aqualad speedy and superboy. I love how they introduced Artemis and Zatanna as well. The whole season was near perfect with few miss steps. I just would have loved to see what got these characters from S1 to S2. 

To me Young Justice was a show about teenagers who happen to be superheros. It was about family

Now the reason why we chose to use Dick’s DiscoDick original Nightwing outfit is because we wanted to bring it into the show and since this flash back happens a month or so after Dick left the mantle of Robin he just wanted a sense of “freedom.”
 
You guys shouldn’t have to worry about any of this yet because **this week is just for the first chapter**
 
 ----

July 5th
 
Dick is looking at a holo of Jason he dozes off into a flash back
 
it’s of his first time meeting Jason after becoming Nightwing.
 
**.... (this is what you fill in will fill in)** *what you guys want to hit on is Dick being unsure that of Jason since he is so “rough” and eventually accepting him*
----
 
At the end of the metaphorical day Dick now thinks of Jason as younger brother no matter how rough his edges are…
 
Suddenly
 
Kal'Dur asks what he is here since he is on a break
 
Dick mentions that he needs to speak to Bruce... Continued next story week.

*In the other corner*: [Sphere](http://youngjustice.wikia.com/wiki/Sphere). Arriving on Earth in a Boom Tube, so her offensive potentials are widely unknown, since we mostly see her acting as Superboy's vehicle.

So this will be the last match of the first half. This tournament really is taking a while. I hope people stay interested. Perhaps some ideas for interesting Round 2 stuff? Especially because the show will be back on at that point.

* Back when we used to do it I spoke of prizes

* **THERE IS NO BAD ART, ACTUAL PAINTINGS, SKETCHES, FAN FICTIONS, COMIC STRIPS, RENDERS, CREATIONS IN MINECRAFT

New Changes:

* Monthly themes! Basically you can still draw what ever you want but there is the theme if you wish to observe it. For example for the remainder of this month we could have a Happy Holidays or Christmas Theme for the show!

* Fan art does not have to be exclusive to the show. Meaning if you want to submit a picture of Starfire

The glow of Gotham at night feels so much brighter than it does at day. Jumping from rooftop to rooftop has always felt more natural than my old acrobatics in the circus. It’s gotten so busy with the team that I’ve barely been able to get out and when I do just running is the most calming thing I can do. Not running away just…running. But tonight it’s different. Tonight I’m running for a different reason.

Yesterday, running along the tops of buildings I’ve grown to love. Soon I arrive, finding a skylight open that shouldn’t be open. I jump down, landing next to the boxing ring. I walk around, seeing where this mystery guy is.

“Well, taking out my ecrima sticks right as a man jumps down onto the training floor.

“Who are you and what do you want with Dick Grayson?” I ask to the man with the red helmet and black biker jacket. New scarecrow? One of jokers new goons?

“I’m hurt
	“Never seen you before in my life.”
	“Oh wait
	Red hood…No way! That was one of Bruces oldest enemies. But he died in that chemical plant years ago. 

“I’m not going to ask you again

“It’s red hood, make sure you’re doing okay.”

I barely have time to think before he throws a knife straight towards my face. I dodge and I hear the knife make a loud THWAK in the wall behind me. He charges at me, I block. He’s putting me on the defensive, that’s not good. I have to take control fast. Fortunately, he gives me an opening when he goes for a sweeping crack at my head. I jab once in his gut with my left, and a one-two in his face, followed by powerful kick to his midsection. His feet lift the ground and he flies back, landing on his shoulder. The pop from the dislocation echoes throughout the building. He gets up, he gets his shoulder back.
“Still as good as ever

Might as well drop any pretense of playing dumb “Who are you

“Is it really that hard to figure out? Ah well

“You expect me to just let you get away? You don’t know me at all.”

“Oh I know you won’t. Tell Bruce I’m gonna stick around. I’ll be watching. Oh and tell Tim to not ruin the name. Lots of memories wrapped up in there

He immediately abandons this once he is free. Was the suit only needed since he was underground and therefore could not harvest the sun himself? (I seem to recall in the traditional Superman comics Superman's cells act as batteries that can store solar energy to fuel his powers).  In one comic he actually fights a vampire (Dracula I think) and when bitten the Vampire explodes since he is basically ingesting stored solar energy. 

So once Super Boy is above ground his cells can harvest the solar energy directly without the suit? Or maybe since Super Boy was only chronologically a couple of months old when they found him the suit was used to jump start his cells (i.e. accelerate the rate of charging since he is starting at zero charge).

=========

Way I see it

Why is the War World still in orbit? First of all, I don't know, sent it hurling into the sun, or Jupiter, or something? 

Unless the Reach are able to boom tube in more forces, Blue Devil, Flash, and Aquaman are badasses. Flash is fast enough he could vibrate through a scarab and disable it. Mera and Zatanna are powerful magic users. Miss Martian is about as strong as her uncle. Speaking of, one of the beetles is a Martian. Anyone ever see *Justice League: New Horizons*? Batman to Martian Manhunter: ""I have a $1,000,000 sliver of radioactive meteorite for the one from Metropolis. For you all I need is a penny for a book of matches."" Green Beetle is out of commission from fire.  

Earth has two Green Lanterns besides Jon Stewart. Though the Guardians have a treaty with the Reach

I guess if the Reach somehow gets control of the War World, I don't get why it's even around. 

Will Earth villains side with the Reach? Perhaps not all of them. After all, is the Light really aligned with the Reach, or are the Reach being used as well? It seems that the Light are really Earth villains, and I don't think that they'd be pleased with a Reach apocalypse. 

And then there's Sphere

TL;DR... Unless there are some massive reinforcements called in

Another shot for the Terror Twins comes right after Tommy's defeat. Also, but try to think about this in terms of a fight, not a popularity contest.

--------

**Deep Sea vs. Deep South**

*In this corner*: [Lagoon Boy](http://youngjustice.wikia.com/wiki/Lagoon_Boy). When we first met Lagoon Boy, derpy transformation. I for one think it's pretty cool.

*In the other corner*: [Tuppence Terror](http://youngjustice.wikia.com/wiki/Tuppence_Terror). Not much to say about Tuppence that I didn't say about Tommy. Usually villainous pairs have a strong one and a smart one

--------

So let's see how this goes. Sometimes I think I'm weird because I personally like Lagoon Boy a lot, person... no, um, humanoid being win!

Sorry about the lateness. I'm moving about a bit before the holiday

--------

**Full Speed vs. Full Force**

*In this corner*: [Impulse](http://youngjustice.wikia.com/wiki/Impulse). The boy from the future fills the speedster role in the new team

*In the other corner*: [Tommy Terror](http://youngjustice.wikia.com/wiki/Tommy_Terror). One of my personal favorite villians, and super-thick southern accents. Like all characters introduced in the first generation, we are assuming he is in his smaller, pre-timeskip shape.

Finally we have a round with Aqualad. I'm not trying to tilt the results, I'm still looking for suggestions to replace the Klarion and the Riddler.

--------

**Alpha-male Altercation**

*In this corner*: [Aqualad](http://youngjustice.wikia.com/wiki/Aqualad). The de-facto leader of the first season team is a serious contender

*In the other corner*: [Wolf](http://youngjustice.wikia.com/wiki/Wolf). Like Mr. Tawny, and smart. After all, anyone Superboy would pick as a best friend has to be tough.

Due to some talk in the last post, if anyone has any great ideas for some new combatants, I am looking to replace the Riddler and probably Klarion. They are both outside the appropriate power level for this tournament, though in opposite ways.

---------

**Daughter of Fate vs. Sons of Ivo**

*In this corner*: [Zatanna](http://youngjustice.wikia.com/wiki/Zatanna). In season 1, she showed real promise in a handful of situations, and clearly she has stepped it up enough to join the Justice League during the timeskip. For this fight, we are assuming it is **pre-timeskip Zatanna**.

*In the other corner*: [Six MONQIs](http://youngjustice.wikia.com/wiki/MONQI). Although fairly weak as individuals, their name stands for ""Mobile Optimal Neural Quotient Infiltrators,"" which is awesome. They would totally win a name tournament.

I'm going to need some input with the members of the team that don't have an emblem (Beastboy, etc) so if you guys have any ideas please let me know in the comments.

I hope you all like this update and be sure to let me know if you find some kind of bug or something not working properly. Thank you!

Now until then I am absolutely certain that until we roll out the new plan this will continue to piss people off so until then tough luck. 

I ask that if you do what to list your reasons why we should deviate from the quo you do it here so we can refer to this thread in our discussions. But **PLEASE DO NOT GO CRAZY AND PLEASE REMAIN COURTEOUS**. Also any complaint in any other thread discussion or other that has to do with this issue that is not within this thread will be removed since it does not add to the discussion

However we have not decided on anything right now and until then we will stick with the current plan.

HERE IT IS:

* From 10:00 am EST - 11:00 am EST - Timekpr will be responsible

* From 11:00 am EST - 12:00 pm EST - Shiniholum (me) 

* From 12:00 pm EST - 1:00 pm EST - John

**The Youngest Child vs the Wild Child**

*In this corner*: [Tim Drake](http://youngjustice.wikia.com/wiki/Robin). The new Robin brings his own style to the job. Sure he doesn't have the mad acrobatic skills of his living predecessor, he might be the smartest of the three boys who have donned the costume.

*In the other corner*: [Shimmer](http://youngjustice.wikia.com/wiki/Shimmer). Until recently, though not perfected, the power to melt things that she touches. We can assume that she is highly dangerous in close quarters.

**A Badass Belt-Based Brawl**

*In the other corner*: [Rocket](http://youngjustice.wikia.com/wiki/Rocket). Although we didn't get to see a lot of her in action, otherwise we have a full-fledged leaguer fighting a child.

In the past we have had Batman: The Animated Series, Batman Beyond, The Batman, Teen Titans, Static Shock, full-fledged movies such as Under the Red Hood, Justice League: Doom, its fantastically scripted and animated

One of the only draw backs to the show is the frequent hiatus’s the fans have to deal with but

This Saturday DC Nation returns to television with it comes the rest of the second season of Young Justice

So we from /r/youngjustice would like to invite anyone who might be interested or even already watching the show to join us this weekend at /r/youngjustice for the discussion of the show and even for people to sort of get accustomed to it just from the sub. 

----

Features that we have at /r/youngjustice:

* [Young Justice IRC Chat](http://centralchat.net/chat/YoungJusticeIRC). The IRC was implemented so that until the mods of the sub can get up the official discussion thread for the latest episode members of the community can discuss the episode.

* We have a wide selection of image flair that is always changing

* After the show returns we will probably have another text flair give away where I will post a self post saying that anyone that wants any titles has 4 (or so) hours to post and Ill give it to them.

* We have Fan Art Fridays where the community can submit any fan art at all whether it is a drawing, a poem, you name it.

* We have our own [twitter feed](http://www.twitter.com/youngjusticesub) where people can check the status of the sub if there are any issues or anything

* Presence at Cons. This is something new we are trying with NYCC where we will have a presence at a con to report on all related news through our Twitter account. 

So please come on over to /r/youngjustice to enjoy the show with us!

Thought this comic was really great.  I've bought a few other issues of the comicbook and came away feeling pretty lukewarm about most of them.  This one, but all of Dick's scenes were gold, and seeing Connor and Megan's flashback was a treat.  Plus, the cliffhanger for the issue makes this feel like a much more ambitious comicbook than it was before (all of those were basically two-issue stories).  That only makes sense, since this is the lead-in to the Invasion storyline we're getting in the show.  And that's another strong point of the issue:  even though it's set just a month before the start of the show's timeline, it doesn't feel pointless.

Day 1. How you found out about Young Justice?-i found out by promos hear say and me basically googleing(spelling?) all the info i could . the show sounded amazing on paper. and it looked beautiful too.

Day 2. thoughts on the season 2.5 trailer recently released.- man it was epic! Static

Day 3. Favorite villain and why?-honestly ill go with black manta. he seems like he is gonna play a bigger role in coming episodes. he is intelligent,and he just joined the light. he will be a force to be reckoned with.

Day 4. Least favorite villain and why?- i never really cared for ultra-humanite

Day 5. Favorite male character and why?- that would have to be Aqualad for a few simple reasons, a good leader, very perceptive, has unique and useful weapons and is just an all around bad ass. 

Day 6. Favorite female character and why?-rocket;for many reasons explained [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/youngjustice/comments/tiyk0/my_fellow_redditors_gather_around_boys_and_girls/)

Day 7. Least favorite character and why?-lagoon boy. honestly seemed like an asshole. not the lovable woleverine asshole the annoying water based bad catchphrase having  asshole.

Day 8. Best mentor and why?(EX. Aquaman, Martian Manhunter,Icon etc.) favorite mentor icon but best would have to be well batman. he atleast somewhat respects the teams space.hes not overbearing he  lets them figure things out on their own.which is sometimes what  kids need. plus he's fucking batman.

Day 9. Worst mentor and why?(EX. Aquaman, Martian Manhunter Icon etc.) none are bad perse just not as good as others. i vote for aquaman. nothing person just wish he would have been honest with aqualad.but overall i guess he's a pretty good mentor.

Day 10. Best friendship and why? gotta god with the friendship between wally and dick.they seem to know alot about each others past,and just seem to have real good chemistry. all that equals to a great friendship.

Day 11. Superpower/skill you’d want and why? i would to have a powerset like [Idie Okonkwo aka Oya](http://worldofblackheroes.com/2010/10/06/idie-okonkwo-oya/) Idie is a high level thermo-kinetic mutant able to generate both heat and cold from her body. Not only can she generate Ice and fire but also control their shape and intensity she is also immune to temperature extremes. that just screames bad ass. look [here](http://worldofblackheroes.files.wordpress.com/2010/10/oya7.jpg)

Day 12. Favorite ship and why? id have to  say wally and artemis. it was just a long time coming. through out season 1 they really teased it and it warmed up to me. plus i think artemis will straighten wally out.

Day 13. Least favorite ship and why? lagoon boy and megan. honestly lagoon boy is a douche.

Day 14. Favorite from the Justice League team and why? icon.he's black, alien who crash landed in the southern usa circa 1839 and lived thtough slavery harlem Renaissance great depression and so many other historical events. and he can go toe to toe with superman need i say more?

Day 15. Least favorite from the Justice League team and why? hmm honestly i didnt really dislike anyone.

Day 16. Robin or Aqualad as leader and why? aqualad because even though he wasnt groomed to be leader since age 9(robin) he is very capable of making sure the mission gets done.

Day 17. Favorite quote ""youre overwhelmed freeze was underwhelmed what isnt anyone just whelmed?"" -robin

Day 18. Favorite Superboy/Miss Martian moment-when superboy accepted her appearance even though she was really scared of the reaction. i found it really touching.

Day 19. Funniest moment-i remember when Artemis made some jokes about alomst drowing like twice that was pretty funny.

Day 20. A mentor and protege you’d want to spend the day with and why?robin and batman. because hes fuckin batman. and just spending time with them would teach alot to anybody.

Day 21. Favourite “Red” tornado hands down. but firebrand was pretty cool.

Day 22. Favorite episode and why? the episode where all the adults disappear. great episode that took place on my birthday! nov 5th.

Day 23. Favorite mentor/protoge relationship and why?i really like batman and robins relationship. its really unique. bruce cheered robin up by playing basketball with him. among other things. its just really really cool.

Day 24. Thoughts on episode 207 ""Depths"" its a great set-up for whats to come.and i love the twist at the end.

Day 25. Who you want to see more of on the show. rocket hands down!

Day 26. Explain your thoughts about the show in general-i feel its  a very diverse and unique show that shows great stories, its funny and just all around amazing. something tv needs.

Day 27. Are you a villain or a superhero and why. probably a villain. because powers corrupt everybody. and im only human. plus i could chill all day no need to rush out at all hours of the day like heroes. ill be sensible lol

Day 28. Any character you’d want to be- mos def Aqualad. the triple C Kal'dur who leads the team

Day 29. Any changes you’d make to the show-

* make it an hour long. this way we can have more character developent


* honestly i  cant really think of anything else. well maybe more milestone.thats just me.

Day 30. Who you’d add to the show-wow man i could write a moutain about this. i'd only add characters if they actually get used to their potential that being said [heres](http://www.reddit.com/r/youngjustice/comments/ugqmd/if_you_could_add_one_member_to_the_team_who_would/) my answer.

In Young Justice so far, she has twelve sisters on Mars (Artemis's introduction), and the White Martians do exist and have a deep racial conflict with the Greens (Targets). On the latter occasion, she explains the conflict between the races first, portrayed the Whites as a persecuted underclass, referred to neither color as ""we"" or ""us"", and then hurriedly tacked on a statement to the effect of ""I'm Green, she was disturbed when Black Canary told her she'd turned white

In J'onn's appearances, H'ronmeer's Curse, or any other family members.

So... is this a legitimate difference between Earth-16 and New Earth

If what she's said about Mars is all true, which I think is a pretty huge divergence from normal New Earth continuity- not to mention, you know, *human history.* here might actually *be* visible canals on Mars in this universe. 

Also, Martian mutant  and *architect* of Hronmeer's Curse. If the writers don't want M'gann to be someone who lied to her friends, even just to be accepted despite her heritage, then the introduction of her father as a bad guy would still be a similarly-sized bombshell.

On the other hand, and one subquestion:

1) Is there a sizable Green Martian population in this universe at present?

**Edit: Yes. Greg Weisman says and tie-in comic issue 6 confirms

1a) What does human history look like if there's a thriving race of telepaths on the next world over?

2) Is M'gann actually J'onn's niece, after all, and even if there's some deception here, the fact that he corroborates her story means that either he believes it (he does regard her as family by either adoption or some other bond) or he's decided to help her conduct said deception.

**Edit: According to info from tie-in comic issue 6 on the YJ wiki

&gt;  M'gann entered, Martian Manhunter kept his word, and brought her to Earth.

**This means that J'onn considered her his niece before she became his protégé. So if there is deception as to their relationship, though.**

2a) If M'gann is J'onn's niece- is Malefa'ak her dad?

Edit: The confirmed lack of Hronmeer's Curse in this universe so far sharply decreases Malefa'ak's importance as a character. Still,,False,self,t5_2t3l1,True,,True
