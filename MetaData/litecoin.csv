1364672293.0,1bbfdc,Will mining Litecoins make me more money than Bitcoins? (Answer: YES),Normif,106,27,40,"Hi

I think a lot of the activity in this subreddit is from people realizing that GPU mining of Bitcoin is becoming unprofitable;  you are looking to Litecoin as your latest venture.  If that's what you're here for

Litecoin is by far the most popular alternative cryptocurrency, it differs in well thought and beneficial ways.  Where it doesn't, it inherits the time tested strengths of Bitcoin.

In particular

The big difference though is that Litecoin's proof of work algorithm is Scrypt.  Scrypt replaces Bitcoin's SHA-256.  This is a major change which affects the type of computers that can be used for mining.

Bitcoin over the next half a year will become almost entirely mined by ASICs because GPU miners are so much less efficient at computing Bitcoin's SHA-256 algorithm.  The difficulty will become so high that GPU miners will actually lose money to electricity costs.

On the other hand, but Litecoins are already consistently more profitable to mine than Bitcoins.  If you watch the charts [here](http://dustcoin.com/mining), you'll very often find Litecoins producing 10-30% better yields than Bitcoin.

And that's only at the current exchange rates!  I personally find Litecoins to be undervalued relative to Bitcoin by a very large margin.  This is for multiple reasons.  First

You could think of Bitcoin currently as a toddler and Litecoin as an infant (with other altcoins being still in the womb and looking for a reason to be birthed).  Bitcoin can now be easily exchanged with most major world currencies and there is a growing network of tools which make it easier, but it is coming!   It is already easy to exchange your Bitcoins for Litecoins through btc-e.com and I expect the better Bitcoin exchanges and merchant services will adopt Litecoin support as interest continues to rise.  When it's ready, we'll see a wave of value increase similar to what Bitcoin has seen.

I have seen a lot of people question why Litecoin or any altcoin needs to exist outside of Bitcoin and had to question it a lot myself before I jumped into Litecoins because I didn't see many good arguments out there.  Most were based on poor assumptions of the fundamentals of the architectures and didn't really establish a solid ground for the longterm coexistence of multiple cryptocurrencies.

Then I realized that it is important for at least two cryptocurrencies which are secured by different classes of hardware to exist because it provides greater security and stability to the system of cryptocurrencies as a whole.  For one, it ensures that markets can't be brought to a halt if there's a temporary issue with one cryptocurrency.  Finally, a coin which can be secured with general purpose hardware (that is, Litecoin) is harder for governments to regulate against because it means that EVERYONE can mine them no matter what; governments won't ban general purpose computers, but they might ban crypto-hashing ASICs (and there are already countries which are unable to import the existing ASICs).

Imagine when all exchanges and merchant tools integrate Bitcoin and Litecoin

So my best recommendation for you is to mine and (mostly) hold Litecoins.  Spend them whenever you can, I am mostly buying Litecoins because I think they're more undervalued than Bitcoins.

P.S.: I go into more depth on why cryptocoin diversity is good and why it's good to have a coin which is efficient to mine on GPUs in my earlier posts on [Cryptocurrency Market Evolution](http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1ampih/cryptocurrency_market_evolution/) and the [Long Term Future of Cryptocurrencies](http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1b5e3f/the_future_of_cryptocurrencies_long_term/).

**EDIT:**  A few days after I posted this a Venezuelan posted [asking about Litecoin](http://www.reddit.com/r/litecoin/comments/1bny62/litecoin_for_the_3rd_world/).  In Venezuela

**EDIT 2:** Litecoins are trading around $4 each.  I recently wrote about why I think [Litecoins are still undervalued](http://www.reddit.com/r/litecoin/comments/1bpml0/litecoin_4x_undervalued_at_4/).

**EDIT 3:** Litecoins are now valuable enough and the mining levels are high enough that the network is becoming pretty secure.  Now is the perfect time to get more people to accept Litecoins for goods and services.

1366553494.0,1cssqr,The Math: Why litecoin is more secure than bitcoin,sup3,82,23,48,"###Background:

This came out of some research I put into finding out the probability of a 51% attack for bitcoin.  You'd think that mining 6 blocks in a row would be hard to do, if you do it enough times, it becomes not only possible, but [downright likely, even with a mere 100 coin flips](http://wizardofodds.com/image/ask-the-wizard/streaks.pdf) (warning:pdf).

With bitcoin mining 144 blocks per day a 51% attack with 50% hashing power is just as likely.  [Even with 35% hashing power it's relatively trivial to pull off](http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1cr2r2/a_pool_with_35_hashing_power_has_a_992_chance_of/). The reason most people probably haven't thought about this before is because the math itself isn't very straitforward.  According to askamathematician.com, and a probability of .35 for 35% hashing power.  The result is about a 70% probability over a 1 week period and a 99.2% chance over a 1 month period.

Sense all the legwork had been done solving this problem for bitcoin I thought I'd run the math again for litecoin and what I found is actually quite surprising.  Litecoin isn't just more secure than bitcoin

　

###Gambler's Ruin ／ why litecoin is more secure than bitcoin:

I figure the reason is in both cases you're trying to ""beat the odds"" and mine every single block for a 1 hour period but with more ""roles of the dice"" occuring during that same period of time it's a lot harder to keep up your winning streak with litecoin than it is for bitcoin. 

While a bitcoin pool with 35% hashing power can reasonably expect to be able to pull off a 51% attack within one week, but for an entire year, even for 100 years!

The numbers here are 4

　

###How many litecoin blocks give you similar security to bitcoin?

With the numbers so dramatically in litecoin's favor one would assume you'd need overall less time to verify a transaction with litecoin than you would with bitcoin.  Generally we have assumed it takes 4 litecoin blocks to equal the security of 1 bitcoin block but this has always been a guess.  Even the people who run the litecoin-project on github [know this isn't true](https://github.com/litecoin-project/litecoin/wiki/Comparison-between-Bitcoin-and-Litecoin) (see bullet #3 on *Faster transaction time*).  The problem again is the math not being a simple equation that you can easily solve for but [using that same calculator](http://www.pulcinientertainment.com/info/Streak-Calculator-enter.html) at the 50% threshold I've found that 8 litecoin blocks give you about the same security as 6 bitcoin blocks.

The nature of this problem is that it's not a linear relationship -- at 30%, so much so litecoin offers similar security at 20 minutes as bitcoin does at 60 minutes.",,False,self,t5_2szgd,False,,

Excerpts:

Market Cap

With 333201 blocks mined,660,050 litecoins in circulation.  The current market price of $2 USD gives Litecoin a market cap of over $33 million.

This may sound like a lot,157 million USD with the current market price of $98 USD.  If litecoin had the market cap of bitcoin, each litecoin would be worth over $69.  

Granted, litecoin is much younger and has not reached the halfway point to its limit of 84 million litcoin.  If we factor in that there will be four times as many litecoins as bitcoins, each one of the 84 million litecoins would still be worth over $13 if litecoin had the bitcoin’s market cap.  


Litecoin Mining Difficulty

 A while back

As anticipated,673,000 with the next difficulty estimated to be near 9,000,000.  News of the impending deployment of thousands more is forcing miners to rethink their allocation of existing infrastructure.  

Faced with bitcoin’s increasing mining difficulty

 Keep mining bitcoin at a potential loss as electricity costs become much greater than the return on mining.
Turn off their miners and sell or retire their hardware.  
Look for more profitable applications for their existing infrastructure

This is where the power of litecoin is very apparent.  Due to it’s use of the memory intense scrypt algorithm

In the short time I have been litecoin mining, litecoin’s mind share will increase, and it shouldn’t be a quickly passing event.  Miners can take confidence in litecoin knowing that their infrastructure will be valuable for the foreseeable future, and this confidence is bound to poor over into the market price of litecoin.

It is also a way of makeing bitcoin more anonymous by diversifying into another established crypto blockchain.

3. The introduction of LTC on Gox will provide liquidity between exchanges, and you will be left with small and easy gains.

4. LTC might get pegged as BTC 2.0 if and when daily highs are made consecutively. We know all too well how quickly the media and community can become intoxicated by the prospect of making money.

I haven't seen this considered as a metric for ""awareness"" before, and even above 600% briefly.  Even if people wanted to immediately convert their LTC to BTC, they could make 3 times as much mining LTC right now.  Instead, we've only seen modest growth in mining rates.  If awareness of LTC among the BTC community were as high as people have suggested, LTC mining profitability would be near parity with BTC.  I don't think that we should consider the news very well disseminated, and thus very well ""priced in"" until we see this happen.

Consider too all these factors when evaluating whether the MT.GOX news is ""priced in"":

* The only people trading now are those willing to deal with BTC-e.com.  Many refuse and say ""I'll wait for MT.GOX""

* The only people trading now are those who were already tuned into LTC enough to hear about MT.GOX being rumored to adopt LTC within a couple of days

* There are many BTC traders who haven't even heard of LTC and will learn about it only after they see it show up on MT.GOX.  

* Supposedly just the identity verification queue at MT.GOX is still over 25

Now another factor:  There are many people in the BTC community who fear other cryptocurrencies will hurt BTC.  As someone who held BTC since they were around $1, and why I think they'll help BTC and P2P cryptocurrency in general](http://www.reddit.com/r/litecoin/comments/1bbfdc/will_mining_litecoins_make_me_more_money_than/).  Now I've converted most of my BTC to LTC and am glad I did.  I think that it will take a lot of time for more people in the BTC community to follow down the road I did and stop considering LTC a threat, but that it will happen inevitably.

Along the trend of BTC supporting LTC, it will be in these companies' interest to also support LTC before a competitor takes that market.  BTC and LTC can gain mainstream acceptance and usability synchronously, instead of (as I've seen some people predict) LTC lagging behind BTC a couple of years.  I expect that services like BitPay will integrate Litecoin very soon and [hope that you write and ask them to](http://www.reddit.com/r/litecoin/comments/1bpdw8/ask_bitpay_to_support_litecoin_and_ask_every/).

So those are some general trends I see, so I think we can consider that a fairly conservative value.  Now, consider that since ASICs weren't mining BTC at all at that time and that the network was secured only by GPUs. All of those GPUs will be moving almost entirely to LTC as acceptance of LTC grows in the BTC community and ASICs push GPUs out of BTC mining over the next six months.  So lets say that the $13 value is a conservative estimate of the value of a coin with a network of GPUs securing it the size of what we should soon expect to see securing LTC and with a stretch of services and available goods comparable to what we should soon see available for LTC.  You see what I'm getting at?

So let's say $13 is a conservative estimate of the value of LTC right now.  If we add in the fact that we didn't know more widespread acceptance of BTC was coming when BTC was valued there

Now consider that after MT.GOX supports LTC and news really breaks out about it, Euro, and GBP combined.  Not only will that raise awareness of and interest in LTC, but also many people who might have initially brushed off Bitcoins as a fad will start to think ""maybe there's really something to this.""  So both BTC and LTC would benefit and more people would convert their national currencies to BTC and LTC.  If I'm conservative about the effect this could have by the end of the year, I'd say that could easily double the value of both.  That would make for a $32 Litecoin.

So yes,False,self,t5_2szgd,1365134573.0,,,t3_1bpml0

user /u/casualredditreader gave his idea [over here](http://www.reddit.com/r/litecoin/comments/19obj6/litecoin_prbegins_lets_do_this_day_1_05032013/c93pv2v) i quote:

&gt; * I think that it would be good to get together a list of companies and write to them about litecoin support (I've already asked namecheap and Valve). But

 &gt;* I think Litecoin needs the most is businesses. Litecoin PR team should collect a small purse and use it as a reward. Sort of like how cities use development funds to improve things. Collect a pot of like 10, assistance to people trying to implement LTC in their online store. ""Will you accept LTC? No! Would you do it if I offered you $20? OK.""

 &gt;* Litecoin needs better graphics. I tried finding a Litecoin logo in SVG the other day and couldn't find anything. 

 &gt;* Documentation and help (someone owns litecoinwiki.com but

&gt; * Write to the other exchanges and ask them to support LTC. If it's a minor tweak

&gt; * Someone should set up a a Litecoin Foundation similar to the [Bitcoin Foundation](https://bitcoinfoundation.org)

&gt; * Someone should set up a legit auction site (like bitmit.net) for Litecoin auctions. Atlantis is nice and probably helps with PR but


 I may sound a little too enthusiastic but this is what is needed :)

- The pool operator realized his mistake

- People start to realize that litecoins are missing from their pool accounts

- Another thread with more info here:  https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=172667.0


I had already stopped mining at notroll.in a couple days before the incident, high stales/rejects, and share simply disappearing with no record).

It doesn't look like notroll.in's total hashrate has changed at all because of this - it's still one of the largest pools, or whether they were even mining at all during the double-payment window. All of this was done with zero communication on his site, and followed with accusations that everyone in his pool is a cheater, and lucky he didn't take more, or simply shut his pool down and take everything (seriously, read his comments in the bitcointalk.org threads that I linked).

Since this has happened, and p2pool] to make sure it was not the server that was infected and sending such emails/malware.

I am in NO WAY looking to use my mining pool for such things. I was just hoping to start a small pool without any real issues. If someone else is using my pool to mine using these infected machines


EDIT: I should add some corrections here. The server that I own and pool that I run was not compromised. The email is stating that p2pool is acting as a command and control center for a botnet that is being used to mine litecoins. It appears that the botnet is spreading via email and also DDoSing mtgox. While I could setup iptables to block connections, but how can I see if a miner is a compromised machine before allowing it to mine at my pool? Especially when there are massive amounts of them coming in and mining under different LTC addresses.

EDIT #2: No one has access to the server.
Someone is spreading a .exe file via email.
That .exe is then connecting to my mining pool.
That .exe is then sending itself to all the contacts in the infected persons email client to spread.

Due to this

Here is a copy of one of the abuse emails for further clarification:

Been into bitcoins for the last couple of years and I've just made the switch to litecoins on my GPU miners. Love the promise of a bitcoin-like currency with faster confirms for transactions so I'd like to do what I can to help out the budding litecoin economy. We handmake minimalistic leather belts and wallets in Canada and I'm contemplating the addition of litecoins as a payment method as an experiment of sorts. I've looked into BitPay for accepting bitcoins

What I'm looking for is functionality for our new website that'll enable a ""pay with litecoins"" functionality. I would like it to do something like, an address for it to be paid to, and a receipt generated upon receipt of the payment to that address. I'd like the process to be as automated as possible given the fluctuating value of litecoins; I feel like any value swings between invoicing and payment are either bad for the customer or for my business.

Litecoin support is listed as a 3 BTC stretch goal

&gt;Litecoin Support - 3 BTC
&gt;
&gt;Supporting Litecoin would be a great feature to offer a common location for Bitcoin and Litecoin management. &gt;This feature would specifically entail the following:
&gt;
&gt;--Multiple address formats designed in
&gt;
&gt;--Additional wallet types to encompass LTC addresses and derived Electrum &amp; BIP 32 chains
&gt; 
&gt;--Handle multiple SPV types - one with SHAd256 and one with SCRYPT
 &gt;
&gt;--Connecting to multiple backends simultaneously to collect data for each address space
&gt;
&gt;--Construct a useful user interface where summaries of both coin types are effectively communicated
&gt;
&gt;--Work with individuals offering to serve up Electrum Litecoin nodes to get setup with the latest working code
&gt;
&gt;There is quite a bit of work to get this working smoothly, I expect that after some periods of time reliably &gt;hosting a node, portions of the proceeds for this stretch goal will go towards a donation to the node maintainer. &gt;An example schedule could be: 0.06 BTC for every month of reliable operation up to a year. Beyond that, I hope &gt;other donations can sustain the node maintainers. The value would depend on the time required to implement &gt;this feature.

Litecoin is becoming a very strong contender to Bitcoin [1]. It will soon be on Mtgox, which has been around since 2011, is still a strong contender with long term potential and value. The main difference between Litecoin and Bitcoin is the hashing algorithm used. Litecoin also has faster transaction confirmation times, since blocks are mined at a 4x rate. In my best opinion, Litecoin is better technology than Bitcoin.

Anyways it is a worthwhile thing to look into these before the mainstream gets to them. There are two main exchanges to trade alternative cryptocurrencies

I believe if you run your litecoin client on a dedicated secure OS (a small Linux distro that you don't use for anything else), see the [rationale for the original post](http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1jd3wi/guide_how_to_make_a_secure_yet_practical_wallet/cbdgwl6).

----

### STEP 1: the operating system

To install Lubuntu

- [Install to a USB drive](http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1jd3wi/guide_how_to_make_a_secure_yet_practical_wallet/cbdgwyg)
    or
- [Install to your disk](http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1jd3wi/guide_how_to_make_a_secure_yet_practical_wallet/cbdgy36)

Installing to USB is more secure because if someone takes control of your primary OS, so feel free to install to your hard disk if you want.  
Remember that you need less than 8 GB of space (Lubuntu takes 4.5 GB, but if you can, leave more just in case. Resizing partitions can be a PITA.


### STEP 2: the client

Unfortunately we don't have the equivalent of Armory or Electrum for litecoin yet

0. Download Litecoin-Qt for GNU/Linux from https://litecoin.org/. Make sure the download page is secure (https://).
0. Open the file (you may need to open your Downloads folder and double click it there). There should be a folder inside named ""litecoin-0.x.x.x-linux""
0. Right click your desktop, stupid I know).
0. On the next screen, then find the litecoin icon in `litecoin-linux/src/share/pixmaps/bitcoin256.png`.
0. Close the dialog and launch Litecoin by double clicking your new icon. Select Settings -&gt; Encrypt Wallet

    Since keys can be bruteforced easily, [[2]](http://www.fourmilab.ch/javascrypt/pass_phrase.html). Litecoin says ""eight or more words"" but that's completely crazy.
0. Restart Litecoin. Click on File, **if you lose it you will lose your litecoins** (you can't make a paper or brain wallet). Due to change addresses, you have to backup your wallet regularly after sending coins. Litecoin-Qt keeps a pool of 100 addresses, so you should only lose your coins if you make 100 transactions without backing up, but it's safer to do it after every time.

    I recommend using a directory that gets automatically backed up (for example
0. That's it! If you already have litecoins somewhere else

    
    


To keep this system secure

- Launch this system only to send or receive litecoins. Avoid installing other software or messing with configuration files. If you just want to test something on Linux
- NEVER leave your computer alone near untrusted people with your wallet open. At least close litecoin.
- Install system updates as soon as you get prompted.
- Keep litecoin updated. It will probably warn you when there's a new version.

**Background:**

I was looking for a small ticker that would show LTC prices in BTC for Chrome, it made sense to make another one for BTC. 

**What:**

Three Chrome extensions, with the following features:

* Shows current exchange rate on its icon

* Supports BTC and USD exchange rates for LTC and PPC

* Alert notifications, or setting up several rules, which, well, ain't nobody got time for that, these extensions take one single threshold. If the price goes up or down this value, you'll get a notification, if you set it to 10 USD and the current BTC price is 135 USD, 155, see if it works for you aswell.

* Alerts work even if you hide the extensions

* Alerts have memory: go offline or hibernate

* Doesn't require signup and doesn't ask you for your email address or any other data for that matter unlike other web services dedicated to alerts.


So without further ado:

* [Tiny BTC Ticker](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tiny-btc-ticker/phegclbgebimkcbmddleefnbnphckgeb)

* [Tiny LTC Ticker](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tiny-ltc-ticker/bdaippkmonkpdmjgabfmheecfgcfpaec)

* [Tiny PPC Ticker](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tiny-ppc-ticker/nknlbflgcifnoipobbndhhjilbailplh)


**Why:**

I built them mainly for myself out of necessity, but it does the job for me at least.

---

**FAQ** 

(Aka questions that nobody actually asked yet

**PERMISSIONS. Holy shit dude, a troll from btc-e?**

I tried to explain it a bit in the extension page but I'll give it a go here aswell. Chrome permission system is a bit strict: there's no granularity. In order for the extension to be able to fire a request to say https://data.mtgox.com/api/2/BTCUSD/money/ticker I have to request permission to mtgox.com. But even if the extension requests permission only to ""https://data.mtgox.com/api/*"" which would only give it access to the API, which I will, but in the meantime you can review the extact content of the extensions, with original code indentation and comments and all (it's not minified or obfuscated), by pulling it directly from the chrome web store as a zip file. [Here's](http://www.labnol.org/software/view-source-of-chrome-extension/21284/) how to do it. I'm suggesting this just so anyone can already review the code today before it's up on Github, it's basically a very simple script in JS with no backend or external communication other than the exchanges and the extension.

**Does the extension talk with a backend/server of yours?**

Nope

**Wait, support any cryptocurrency within a single extension?**

In Chrome each extension only gets one icon, you'll need one extension for each. This is the main reason why I chose to do one extension per currency.

**Where do you get the data from?**

Currently this is set as follows:

* BTC to USD: mtgox.com

* LTC to BTC: btc-e.com

* LTC to USD: btc-e.com

* PPC to BTC: btc-e.com

* PPC to USD: vircurex.com


This can't be changed at the moment but I may add more data ""providers"" later on.

**The tickers price lags a bit

I'm inclined to believe exchange services, I'll look into it further but so far it hasn't been a tremendous problem, it's definitively not an issue for alerts/notifications.

**Can you add SMS notifications?**

Nope

**Can you implement XYZ?**

Sure

**Can you build a Tiny Ticker for {insert cryptocurrency here}?**

Sure

**I found a typo! You can't words!**

Easy

**What color is your underwear?**

Usually white

I'm new to the world of BitCoin and LiteCoin mining, even though I don't see a massive profit to be made just yet.

I'd like to share with you my ""budget"" rig; I've seen some rigs that are very expensive

**This setup is giving me an average of 630KH/s in total**

1) Annotated picture of my rig **[HERE](http://imgur.com/BHjYNZG)**

2) If you'd prefer a video walk-through

Aaaand the full spec of my machine as follows:

* Gigabyte GA-Z77-DS3H Socket 1155 VGA DVI HDMI 7.1 Channel Audio ATX Motherboard @ £57.44
* Intel Celeron G540 2.50GHz Socket 1155 2MB L3 Cache Retail Boxed Processor @ £27.49
* 2x PowerColor HD 6870 PCS+ 1GB GDDR5 Dual DVI Dual Mini DisplayPort HDMI PCI-E Graphics Card @ £183.30

* Be Quiet Pure Power L7 630W PSU @ £55.82

* **VAT** @ 20% = £412.84 plus delivery.

The case and the hard drive are what I found lying around in my place of work, I don't deem it necessary at all. I just took the sides &amp; top off an old case I found, so everything was nicely exposed and open.

For cooling, and I've not really pushed anything over about 70 degrees C - the fans on these particular cards blow air onto the heatsink, which then dissipates around the cards, so passing air over and through seems to be the best way to remove heat, lastly it's in an inherently cold room that nobody ever goes in (around 6 or 7 celcius all the time) tucked away in a corner.

**A word of advice about the PSU** - If you're thinking of scrimping on a cheap PSU, daisychained 3 more PCI-E plugs from a single molex and the PSU sparked and went out with an almighty bang within about 3 minutes flat. Whatever GPU card(s) you buy, AMD has a list of reccomended PSU's that will work with them. Use one of those.

All of my gear was purchased from eBuyer online, at trade price, for personal use (gutted!).

I'm running W7HP with all the performance settings switched on, a Powershell script that emails me to let me know if my system has rebooted itself, and one that emails me total system uptime every 2 hours. This basically means I don't have to keep checking on it as often, because if something goes wrong, I won't get any emails, or if the machine reboots unexpectedly, I'll be notified.

I've got a dedicated VPN pointing right at it, from my laptop at home, or from my Android phone where-ever I am.

Any more info just ask - Happy mining :)

However, if that is the case

I also [read the thread](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=153460.0) earlier on bitcontalk.org where someone offers to pay people to attack the litecoin network? Stranger still is the moderators have not even deleted or locked the thread? What sort of message is that giving out?

Myself, but it just leaves me even more interested in LTC now. I can't help summarising that if *some* of the BTC community feel so threatened by LTC to the point that they are prepared to pay for a 51% attack, then there must be something in LTC!?!

So why is this? Is it to do with a few personalitys and resentments that have been around a while (I know most communities have there dramas) or is it that LTC is seen as a real threat? Perhaps they don't want others to invest in another

That went great and we expect Litecoins to be traded there soon.  I've asked you to ask BitPay to support Litecoins and they've told us they're willing to when the mining level increases enough that they trust the network (it will be soon!  Bitcoin gpu miners will be coming to Litecoins in droves as ASICs make the Bitcoin mining game unfair for them).  They also said that even before that they will definitely be enabling all merchants using their service to accept Litecoins (by converting them to Bitcoins at the point of sale). This community outreach is very successful so far and is what will bring LTC into the forefront.

If all of us can contact a new service every day telling them about why we like Litecoins and why we'd love it if they accepted them or supported them

Now is the time to get major Bitcoin accepting merchants to start also accepting Litecoins; Litecoins should be accepted wherever Bitcoins are.  We should be particularly targeting merchants which already accept Bitcoins because they will be the easiest to convince of the value and will already have the infrastructure in place to make it easy to accept Litecoins.

Please email your favorite merchants to ask if they'll accept Litecoins.  Here's a couple of lists of Bitcoin-accepting merchants: 

* https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Trade
* https://www.spendbitcoins.com/places/

Also email anyone you'd like to buy from every time you want to buy something online and ask if they will accept Litecoins for what you want.

Here is an email you can adapt:

*Hi

*I want to buy stuff from you with Litecoins and hope that you will support them.  They are similar to Bitcoins

*Litecoins are currently worth about $4/each, so if you are interested in Bitcoin as a still-deflationary currency I think you will be even more interested in Litecoins.*

*Please let me know when you plan to provide for this.*

*Respectfully

I live in a 3rd world country and is incredibly hard to buy $ or another Litecoin accepted currency to buy some LC. In fact, but we have an extremely good flexibility to adopt new threads. 

Correct me if Im wrong but, or mining (I have no practical experience so I wont know if could get like... 50 litecoins while leaving my PC on and mining 48 hours, or get nothing in a month, IDK if that is viable), but I think that, to introduce it to the Venezuelan market, someone here has to have a load (BIG LOAD) of litecoins and then start using them here. If you think Im wrong, but remember

Do you guys think that I should invest time + money on mining litecoins (since I cant get a ASICs to compete in the bitcoin mining) and try to talk to big fishes to make it a viable non-government way of payment? Or better not seek for trouble and just try to think little

Based on my budget, after poking around BTC-e for a while, was to use one of their very sketchy looking Russian credit card processors.  Because I didn't trust their processors, I bought a Visa debit card to use for the transaction.  After buying the card and getting back to my dorm room, I saw /u/zdiggler's reply to my [post](http://www.reddit.com/r/litecoin/comments/1bt5eq/how_can_i_buy_litecoins/) here, and realized that I should follow their instructions.  

So I went online and set up the transaction, I finally got to the register, only to be informed that a Moneygram transaction had to be paid for in cash.  Having no cash on me, I ran to the bank to get cash.  

After visiting the ATM up the street, when a stranger walked up to me, and offered me tickets to see the Bob Dylan concert tonight.  Of course, being a broke-ass college student, I accepted.  

Thus, lose money, or break even with Litecoin.  It got me free concert tickets.  And that's good enough for me.  ",,False,self,t5_2szgd,,http://www.reddit.com/r/litecoin/comments/1bue16/bob_dylan_and_litecoin_or_how_i_broke_even/

the litecoin infrastructure is weaker than bitcoin. 

the ltctip is missing in action

the blockchain explorer is not nearly good enough for litecoin

there are not any trustworthy litecoin markets or exchanges

the mainstream bitcoin services don't have a bolt-on tool that lets them easily go litecoin

finally, a truly compelling story

moreover its positioning is confused. some people use the silver:gold analogy

there's no litecoin page on wikipedia

even techies who've heard of bitcoin

there aren't a lot of mainstream services that take litecoin.  there are no tools for them.  there aren't a lot of online illicit services that take litecoin (silk road

faster transactions

another crypto chain adds robustness to the underlying bitcoin ecosystem (serving as a money laundering back alley)

In my view what would really help extend this lead is being first to add support for the zerocoin protocol.

Bitcoin is now too big and cautious to be first with this. In addition it would bloat the blockchain even more at a time when managing blockchain size and dust transactions are already taking a significant portion of development efforts.

Litecoin is presently in the fortunate position of having enough uptake and mindshare to be important but there still being relatively little real world implications of relatively major changes to its protocol.
My prediction is that the current relevant alt-chains to add zerocoin support will get a significant boost in popularity and uptake. 

It should be litecoin.

To send the funds out the exchange would take the public key of the transaction used to deposit and use it to generate an address in the opposite currency. The user could then import the private key they used for litecoin into their bitcoin account or their private key from litecoin to control their bitcoin funds.

To make all this user friendly a website and or software client could be created to show the funds in the litecoin and bitcoin addresses so that people can see the exchange rate for the current round. A software client could read off of the users own copy of the blockchain or from a server like how electrum works and the location of the exchange itself could be kept hidden to prevent denial of service attacks. 

This method of exchange is [batch trading](http://financial-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Batch+Trading) which has its own positives and negatives but it would provide another choice that I believe would have some resistance to denial of service attacks. This form of trading would also have different characteristics when it comes to price manipulation.

So what do people think?

Oh. One more thing. There have been times I've lived off of pizza purchased with btc or ltc earned with my music over the last year and a half. I actually received the first piece of ""fan mail"" of my life from someone who bought my album in 2012 and as far as fan mail goes it was a good booster to get me to put this whole thing together and finish it. For that experience I cannot thank all of you enough. 

In celebration of that, so if you guys want to make donations and send me encouraging messages I will also send you something digital and something that will be unique from the public release.

Good evening Reddit community

Firstly

We are now also ready to offer a very unique opportunity to a lucky few: the chance to invest in the site! That's right. It is truly a defining moment. I must be very clear and say that this is investment only

We are offering 300 investment shares of 0.1 percent of the income of the site (income excludes running costs &amp; management's share, and the amount we will be paying out equates to 25% of the sites income.

There is no limit to the amount of shares any one person can buy. For a 0.1% investment you will earn $200 per month, we will be the FIRST company/website/blog to offer shares in Bitcoin.

Money invested is going to be used in the short-term to finance more servers and to cover more staff to enable us to make Reddit faster and better than ever before, and the amount which will be updated hourly. You will also find options here to change pay-out schedule (weekly, monthly, annually), cancel investment &amp; change view types. We are done beta testing how the new layout will look.

Pay-outs will by default be paid monthly into a BTC wallet address that you will supply us; the schedule can be changed to weekly and a wallet address can be specified for payments. If you decide to cancel your investment

Payment for your shares need to be paid to the address specified below

Payment address - 1K9n6GhReaBWqdBttUYMs3rka9Pj5L8RRd

If you receive an invalid wallet address error

Once you have opted into your shares

Your new investors section will become active 8-10 hours after payment is received. You can speed up this process by messaging the Reddit Support here [1] http://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=Support with your Reddit User name &amp; Amount of investment shares and total BTC sent.

Example:

Subject - Reddit Investment Op JohDoe [Your User name goes here instead] 4 x 0.1 BTC 14.1024

This is strictly first come

Thank you and good luck!

If they know about Bitcoins

If they know about mining

If they know about other chains (PPcoin, etc.) tell them how they all have fatal flaws (they would all cannibalize hardware that could be used to mine Bitcoins, for instance).  Tell them how most are created by unethical developers (Novacoin and PPcoin were created such that an absurd number of coins were generated in the first week and very few are now... basically a premine, and Novacoin was even worse by actually premining coins and using them as a bribe in order to be accepted on the BTC-e exchange).  Litecoin on the other hand was created in an ethical way with no premining, no serious deviations from the Bitcoin philosophy, and in a way that allows it to coexist with a purpose alongside Bitcoin.  Litecoin's creator was even invited to speak at this year's Bitcoin conference and is well respected among the Bitcoin community.

If they aren't familiar with Bitcoin

1366968232.0,1d57ts,"Repost from /r/Bitcoin: Authoring Books on Bitcoin, Litecoin, and Other Cryptocurrencies - How Do You Suggest I Publish?",furuknap,8,9

I'm a seasoned author with 20 IT books under my belt as well as hundreds of articles online and in print

I've been thinking about writing books on Bitcoin and related technologies

I'm not very concerned with making money; I have income from my professional services that take care of that. I write because I love to write and for the conversation to which these books lead when I encounter people in communities. 

That said, and so on that cost me money, so I would like to have some way of recouperating at least direct costs, usually around $1,000 per book. 

I only do electronic books

My options for distribution

- Traditional publishing
 
I set a fixed price, iBookwhatever, B&amp;N, etc. 

Pro: Most likely to get direct costs covered. I also know very well how to do this. 

Con: A lot of people in the world simply can't afford even low prices ($5 will run a family for two days in Cambodia). Also, but I can't accomplish that through external distributors like Amazon. 

- Pay anything
 
I can set up a 'pay anything but must pay something' store

Pro: Drives adoption; users must adopt Bitcoins to pay for books. Also allows anyone to buy book. 

Con: I'll likely end up covering most costs myself, it's only worth $0.01, anyone can write something valued that)

- Community investor funding
 
To cover minium cost, a community funded project and sell 'shares' that will cover initial cost and yield any proceeds back to the community investors. 

A variety of this is that readers can pay anything for three months or until the investors get their money back plus a risk premium

Pro: Makes sure costs are covered and can yield some return to those that agree to fund a book in return for their risk. Also allows me to learn how assets in these markets work (and I want that).

Con: Complex to set up

For option 3, for example a book on cryptocoin mining will be more valuable early. 

I would love your input on how I should publish. I'm sure there are far more ideas than these, my motivation, and not cost me too much money, in that order. 

I understand well how traditional publishing works after having published almost 20 books myself and ran an industry magazine for several years

I may be without Internet access this weekend so I have scheduled an estimated dividend now for Sunday. It is based on the revenue generation so far this week extrapolated up to Sunday. I shall redress differences next week.

Early next week

One that priority is out the way I shall also raise a motion to decide on whether we should leverage the business be issuing a bond or loan instrument with which we would purchase additional mining hardware.

-Kate.

This sentence ""Thanks to the cost of ASIC hardware falling at a similar rate this does not actually affect us as badly as one might think."" should be absolutely terrifying if you are a Ciphermine shareholder.  This statement would only be true if equipment delivery for new hardware kept in pace as well.  The fact that future products are cheaper in $/GH means very little if none of the equipment is deliverable in the near term.  

Also the yield on Ciphermine is going to be almost 10X less than the bond they are offering

The functionality and promising futures of these currencies are really bright. Especially in light of the abusive central bank money printing policies undertaken at this time. I became a member of Mt Gox several months ago where I learned to purchase and trade in BTC. The exchange was very pleasant to work with. I soon came to hear of BTC-E.com and how many more options are out there for trade. I became a confirmed member last moth and purchased some LiteCoin. The LiteCoin was on a roll, and requested an investigation. A few days later BTC-E sends me a list of login times and IP addresses. GREAT....It is plain as day someone from a completely strange IP address logged in and stole my LiteCoin. How? I didn't receive any notification of sucessful login as is usually sent out by BTC-E.com when the account is accessed. So How? I received an incomplete sentence saying, let alone have access to my password. So I am only left to believe someone on the inside of BTC-E.com is strategically targeting accountholders and transferring out LiteCoin for their benefit. Be careful everyone.

1363639963.0,1ajpgv,GPU-friendly mining. 1m BTC market cap. 84m coins. 2.5 minute blocks. A Bitcoiner's report on Litecoin.,dsterry,5,0,0,"Litecoin

In early to mid 2013, 2) password recovery and security testing and 3) non-Bitcoin cryptocurrency mining. Since Litecoin is the cryptocurrency with the next greatest hashing power and is most efficiently mined with GPUs, understanding the current status of the Litecoin network and economy is desirable for those studying the options. Below, I have gathered information to help inform a decision on whether to commit resources to Litecoin.

**Miners**

The current hashrate of the network is roughly 3 gigahashes per second (GH/s). Due to Litecoin's scrypt-based mining algorithm

Source: [http://litecoinpool.org/pools](http://litecoinpool.org/pools)

**History**

Litecoin's genesis block was mined on Thursday Oct 13,000 blocks. The network releases 50 litecoins per block which are targeted to be found evey 2.5 minutes on average. The block reward will halve every 840,000 blocks which will cause the network to produce 84 million litecoins in total.

The currency has traded in the 1.22 mBTC to 17.3 mBTC range since its birth. Trading is highly volatile with 40-50% changes occuring on a daily basis. Most trading volume can be found on the BTC-e exchange (https://btc-e.com) in the LTC/BTC market by a margin of 2:1 over the next highest volume of LTC/USD also at BTC-e. Other supporting LTC/BTC exchanges include Vircurex (https://vircurex.com) and BitParking (https://ltcexchange.bitparking.com).

    All-time price statistics
    -------------------------
    BTC - high: 17.69 mBTC on 3/12/2013     low: 1.22 mBTC on 8/15/2012
    USD - high: $0.75 on 3/7/2013     low: $0.015 on 8/15/2012

The current exchange rate for Litecoin at BTC-e is 12.3 mBTC or $0.55 for one litecoin.

Source: [http://cryptocoincharts.com](http://cryptocoincharts.com)

**Early-adopter advantage**

The ability to acquire currency units cheaply through purchase or mining provided an important incentive to Bitcoin's earlier-adopters. By risking the loss of their time and money they have shared in financial gains proportional to the exchange rate and

A large proportion of early bitcoins were mined when it was extremely unclear if Bitcoin would last beyond a brief experiment. It is then reasonable to expect that many early users did not keep their wallet files or private keys and that a large proportion of early coins will never be spent. While it is difficult to estimate the magnitude of this effect, most of which were familiar with Bitcoin, could expect that Litecoin's success would make their coins worth keeping. The %-days-destroyed metric tracks what fraction of the money supply has moved since it was mined and for Litecoin is 60.3% versus Bitcoin's 43.7%.

source: [http://explorer.litecoin.net](http://explorer.litecoin.net)

**Diversification**

Diversification helps to reduce risk and increase reliability of investments and technological systems respectively. Since Litecoin is the second-most established cryptocurrency and is also blockchain-based it may be used easily to diversify Bitcoin-denominated investments. The unique ease of currency exchange beween this currency pair results from each currency's decentralized management and low transfer fees. While current trading volumes and high volatiltiy limit Litecoin's use for significant and stable diversification, and BTC/USD exchange rate relationships is advised.

From a technical standpoint

Since Litecoin is very similar in use

**Development**

The core client Litecoin-qt/litecoind is based on Bitcoin-qt/bitcoind. It is currently at version 0.6.3 and is based on the same Bitcoin software version. It is 8 months behind the current Bitcoin client. The Litecoin codebase is maintained at https://github.com/litecoin-project/litecoin as a fork of the https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin project. While the same revision control system is in use

Outside the core client codebase, or have disappeared completely though a number of new sites and services have appeared in recent weeks.

**Service Availability**

While Litecoin services such as a block explorer, there are a number of important services that are not yet available. There is no client-side encrypted web-based wallet comparable to Blockchain.info/wallet or the extensive macroeconomic charts at that same site. Mobile software is also limited to a few mining programs with no mobile wallet or exchange rate monitor apps available. Finally, exchange volume is highly centralized on the BTC-e exchange and there is no payment processor that provides any functionality similar to Bit-Pay or Coinbase.

**Conclusion**

This report has provided information on the Litecoin peer to peer Internet currency and will likely be obsolete within hours of its release in many of the figures quoted. The reader is encouraged to retrieve updated information from the sources included in the report as they will undoubtedly affect any decision on whether to support Litecoin.",self,t5_2szgd,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/litecoin/comments/1ajpgv/gpufriendly_mining_1m_btc_market_cap_84m_coins_25/

1366165109.0,1ci8c1,LTC vs BTC: A noobs perspective,bonksnp,5,2,8,"*Disclaimer:  As the title says

So I see so many posts about which is better

Let me begin with this fact.  From my research

**Value:**  With the big spike we saw in the last 2 weeks it's difficult to gauge which one is better.  BTC are obviously worth more now and I believe will remain so.  Why?  Two reasons.  First, if you look at charts over the past month, BTC and LTC are virtually identical in their rise and fall. See links below.

(BTC) http://i.imgur.com/coTnc2K.png

(LTC) http://i.imgur.com/F4lNZzz.png

So why would LTC's surpass BTC's in value if the charts from the past month are any indicator?  Sure it's only a month

**Profitability:**  Let's be honest.  Most people want to make money by either mining or trading in this currency.  Sure there are those who are in it for the science/crypto knowledge
* Mining: Well, but LTC's are still more efficient.  So why mine?  Because in the long run you'll probably edge out those who are sticking with BTC.  Might not be by much, but just enough to justify going the LTC route vs the BTC route.  And this is also going to depend on the hardware you're running, electricity costs and depreciation of your hardware.  And this is all assuming the difficulty for each remains the same.
* Buying: So what if I don't have any hardware to justify mining but still want to try and make some money with LTC/BTC?  You can buy BTC from several different sources.  You can also exchange them for LTC however you're going to get charged some fees along the way, if LTC's hit the MTGox like everyone is saying, this point may be irrelevant.  And again as stated above, BTC are the more popular, stable currency.  Just because BTC are worth more per unit, doesn't mean that it's dumb to buy when LTC are a fraction of the cost per unit.

**Bottom line:**  If you're going to mine, still worth the effort.  If you're going to buy, I'd go the BTC route.  It's a more stable currency and you're probably not gaining anything by buying a less popular currency that may or may not stick around.
