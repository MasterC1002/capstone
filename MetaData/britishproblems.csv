EDIT: Wow, so I'll explain:

The title was sarcasm. I think discrimination, my problem with this news is that the bank gave their reason for adding Jane Austen to the new set as them needing to have a woman, rather than because they believed her contributions to be great enough.

My other gripe is that I personally believe Jane Austen to be a bad choice. This is not because I believe her contribution to be inferior to anyone elses' but because she is already widely famous. I remember when I first noticed Elizabeth Fry on a fiver and it compelled me to find out who she was. I believe that there are many great people, and I feel that including Ms. Austen, who is already a household name, is wasting an opportunity to celebrate someone whose contributions would otherwise go unnoticed.
