Last week, by herself, and I brought up the events of new years eve.  She stopped talking to me and gave me the silent treatment for three days.

I went on a business trip over the weekend and kept in touch with her every day.  When I got back we spent valentines day together.  Yesterday, which I knew about and supported, but what I didn't expect is that she was sending photos to guys via PM.  I continued reading.  One guy asked ""What's the wildest thing you've ever done?""  And there it was.  She responded with, ""On NYE I had my first threesome with a member of a famous 90s rock band and a friend...""  

The first thing I did was speak to a lawyer about my options.  Then I confronted her about it

I got back several hours later

My whole life has been shattered.  We were married for less than a year

Here's what happened...

I met a girl on OkCupid. We met up and had coffee. It ended on a positive note. She even said she wanted to see me again.

Years ago

Over the next three days, two texts per day. She always responded.)

I asked her if she had any plans for the weekend, so she's clearly decided to ignore me; I must have made a very bad impression with the few messages that I sent her over the past few days.

Looking back over my own messages, and, admittedly, I'm actually quite desperate for someone to reciprocate my feelings.

My question is

It's not a matter of hiding how desperate / clingy / love-starved I am. It's a matter of finding a girl who doesn't care.

My question to you is...how exactly do I meet a girl who won't instantly disqualify me for being desperate?

I love her very much. She is to be frank the most beautiful woman I have ever seen. She could easily be a model. She is many guys ideal woman and a certain 10/10. Whenever she goes out she gets hit on CONSTANTLY. Whether i'm there or not actually.

Me

Generally our relationship has been fantastic. Neither of us has been unfaithful and we are very much in love. I certainly love her very very much.

The last six or so months have been stressful however. Work has been into overdrive for both of us

Fast forward to around 2.5 months ago when we were both invited to separate reunions with old friends across the country (neither of us are originally from the area we're living in now). It was a great opportunity for both of us to blow off steam after working so hard and neglecting life for a few months

So we kissed

Lets just say

Hers involved going to a party where in her words

When she came back she was the most loving attentive girlfriend you have ever seen. I was still too tired/exhausted for sex

Fast forward again

She is the most sorry and frightened woman you have ever seen. She even asked me to physically assault her because she is so angry and upset that she cheated on me. She will do ANYTHING I want to make things ok. It's a bit scary actually. She is frightened and literally shaking at the prospect of me leaving her.

If i'm honest with myself I think most of the fear is about the baby. She is crying saying she can't get rid of it and she is terrified of keeping it and raising it alone.

I was completely and utterly numb and heartbroken.

I said to her that before I go any further

The facts were horrifying and made me physically sick. I actually threw up. Basically my girlfriend was this guys personal porn star for the weekend. Some highlights:-

* It was the roughest most aggressive sex she has ever experienced
* She had several powerful and intense orgasms during their weekend in bed. She has never ever cum like this before with anyone or solo.
* His dick was the best she has ever taken. 9"" (he made her fucking measure it during one of their sex games) which rubbed all the right areas and he could keep going for hours
* They didn't use protection (obviously) and he came in her mouth (she swallowed) all over her face
* He smacked her during sex (not too hard)
* He caught some of the above on his camera phone. So there is a video somewhere of my girlfriend basically acting like a pornstar in a cheap hotel room.

So

Currently therefore I have a girlfriend who is pregnant by a male model BDSM hero with a magic cock

We have been talking about marriage and kids this last year and she is desperate for me to commit to that still. She keeps promising to spend the rest of her life making this up to me and will be the perfect wife I could possibly want.

I don't even know what to think right now. I feel like every sense I have has been shorted out and I am now totally numb.

My first instinct is to just wait for her to work in the morning

So I can literally leave and never speak to or hear from her again.

The only problem is that I am so in love with her. I don't feel like I'll ever get over her. Fuck. I'm hesitating. I'm second guessing myself.

What do you think reddit? Is it possible to overcome a situation like this? I can't think how. I simply cannot raise this guys kid. I can't. Fuck.

My heads all over the place. Rational thoughts would be awesome about now.

1271414188.0,brqux,An update on how things went with the 8 year old daughter I never knew I had.,NotReadyForThis,380,66,157,"Hello again Reddit. I came here about 5 weeks ago to ask for advice regarding [my possible daughter](http://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/b9oed/i_desperately_need_help_please_help_me_do_the/).


5 Weeks is an Eternity. 

I got together with Frank and Janet (my exgirlfriend's parents and grandparents to an adorable 8 year old girl who I was told was the daughter I never knew I had). We all sat together for dinner where I was yet again introduced as a 'friend of Mommy's'. I didn't mind telling Cora (not her real name, Cora *knew* about some of these stories too. Mommy had told her about our more memorable roadtrips West and sleeping under the stars and our one trip overseas. Mommy even had some of the photos. Nothing's more surreal than seeing photos I've forgotten about and places I forgot I've been to. Later, when she went to sleep, I spoke with Frank and Janet about the need for a Paternity test. I was worried they would take this the wrong way, like I was trying to shirk off responsibility, or that I had doubts about my ex's intentions. But they were fine with this and so with their help, I arranged to have the test on a Tuesday morning. We also agreed it was a bad idea to tell Cora what the test was for


It only took me a week to realise I couldn't work while I waited since I could not think straight. Lucky for me, even typing this reminds me of just how tightly wound I felt at the time and my eyes get puffy). He told me not to worry and that he'd take care of everything - I can take 2 months off right that day until I sort everything out. (Colin Ackehurst, if you ever read this you're a true gentleman and a friend, and I'm proud to work for you). 


So I found myself with plenty of time to plan my next steps. I spent a lot of time getting to know Cora


I couldn't understand why my ex would tell Cora about our trips together, Cora was playing with her cousin and I had to remind myself of this as she told me I wouldn't never get custody as long as she lived. I told her as calmly as I could that I did not deserve her anger; I did not know about any of this until very recently. She was determined not to care or to listen. She said she'd sought legal advice already and that any court would rule in her favor. The rest of the afternoon was tense as I was determined **not** to go home like a dog with his tail between his legs. I was invited by Frank and Janet for lunch and lunch I will have. If anything, this made Auntie even angrier. That kinda made me feel a bit better. As soon as she left, Frank and Janet were all over me, apologising and telling me not to think too badly of her. They reminded me she had only just recently lost her younger sister, and that she was afraid I was coming to tear their family apart. It calmed me down a substancial bit to put myself in her shoes and to remember that I was the one that needed to reassure them, not the other way around. 


My next incursion was more succesful. Janet put me in contact with Angela - my ex's best friend. Again, who she saw as an 'irresponsible influence' on her sister. I found out just how lonely and how determined my Ex had been all these years. Though they met later in life through work, she knew most of the history between my Ex and I. And I believer that she gave me the answer I've been after. I believe I understand now why my Ex did what she did and how she rationalised it as being the right reason all those years ago. Her decision locked her into a future she had not planned for and she did the best she could. I accept that Cora is the precious gem who she is because of her mother's nurturing and guidance. I still wish she had contacted me many years ago - who knows how things would have turned out? Something else I learnt: I now know that 2 years ago she *did* attempt to contact me. I haven't made a serious attempt at keeping my online privacy and a quick search was able to bring up my cellphone number. She tried calling me the day she found out about the Melanoma. My phone didn't answer and it went into voicemail. She didn't leave a message. She didn't try again, though she had my number and knew where to find me. Again, I can't begin to imagine what must have gone through her mind back then. 

---------------

I wrote that almost 3 weeks ago. At last

While most of the results page consists of six-letter acronyms and numbers

*""the alleged father

So

She is **our** daughter. I'm a father and I have a lot of work to do.

Many weeks ago, she gave me another one. She's excited about being an Aunt once more. Next, I told Frank and Janet, who believed her daughter and were glad their faith was affirmed. 

Tonight, which is why I'm writing this instead of getting ready.

Things were going really well, however, your comments were swirling in the back of my mind and it wasn't enough for me that this girl I shared a home with was smiling, bubbly, happy, back to 'normal', whatever -- because she *never spoke about what she did*. I didn't bring it up myself because I thought she would come to me and maybe even **apologize** about it when she was ready, she just hummed around the house like some sort of innocent princess.

Well, how she could just do something so deranged and then cover it up. And I realized with the way things were going, she was *never* going to acknowledge her behavior or take responsibility for her actions. So I finally said something, but I hid my rage by speaking slowly and calmly: ""So what was that thing with you masturbating?""

I realized it was another pretend-she-didn't-hear-me moment for her as she just stood still for a while in silence, she got a knife. I immediately backed away in the sinking realization that she might actually be crazy enough to stab me, but she then pointed the knife at herself, or more specifically her vagina, and said she ""didn't even need it"" because I ""don't appreciate it"" and ""no one has genitals in the afterlife"". I didn't want to be around for it to escalate further so I booked out of there while she hurled insults at me. Right away I called her mom, since her parents live very closeby, but her mom didn't even let me finish explaining before she was screaming at me over the phone saying she ""knew what I did"" and that I was a ""Satan shitplane"" so I hung up and had to ignore her **literally 37** calls afterward.

1284088182.0,dbwqo,Girlfriend saved some semen -- UPDATE,stolen_semen,384,83,325,"Okay


She called me in the afternoon and told me she'd be back around 7 or so and I was normal on the phone and told her that I'd come over after I was done at the gym (I put the condom back in the freezer in case she went to look -- I didn't want her to know I'd found it until I told her).  So I get to her place and she's in the kitchen putting away groceries and she says hey giving me the warmest smile and so I start getting a little nervous about bringing it up but I figure I need to do it now and not let it build up inside me anymore


Her expression becomes very concerned and I just tell her I found the used condom in the freezer while looking for a leftover ice pop and her face turns bright red.  She bolts for the bathroom and locks the door and I'm now standing outside telling her I don't care about it and the only thing that matters is whether it's mine or some other guy's.  I can hear she's crying and I tell her that it's okay and she can talk to me and I love her and whatever it is we can talk about but she isn't saying anything


It takes her about 10 minutes until she agrees to come out.  She's still crying a little and I sit down on the couch with her


I plead with her to explain it to me.  She begins telling me it's from her ex-boyfriend.  She says she saved the used condom because it made her feel better knowing she had it when her boyfriend dumped her (she's never really mentioned much about previous relationships and I never really prodded as she didn't seem to want to talk about them and I never really cared to know about guys that have slept with my girlfriend so we just didn't talk about it).


I'm thinking about this for a second and it's not seeming to make sense.  How did she get it *after* he dumped her?  I hate to start doubting her already but I have to know the full truth


""What do you mean?  How did you get that from your boyfriend after he dumped you?  And why do you still have it?  I love you so much just tell me so we can get through this.""


I think saying this helped her get it out.  She tells me that when we started dating she was still not over her ex- completely and during the first few months we were seeing each other he was calling her up for sex


She says she was distressed and for some reason when he walked out after he got done one night ""fucking me"", and that he's a piece of shit and he's out of her life now.  This is when she starts crying even more.  And I can feel this isn't everything and I have to ask.


""When was the last time you slept with him?""  


Six months ago.  It hurts.  I was in love with this girl six months ago and I thought she was with me.  I know six months together isn't that long of a time but still that's how it feels.  So I'm crushed.  At first I thought maybe those first few weeks we were just dating was it but apparently not.  She says it was the only time that recent and before that it had been only when we were first seeing each other.  I was out of town and he called her up and said he needed to see her, and that he brought over a box of wine (what a classy piece of shit, right?), they got drunk, and he seduced her.  After that she says she felt horrible and realized what an idiot she was and had been and that that was it and she told him never to speak to her again.


She said she'd forgotten the condom was there.  I asked her if she still had feelings for him and she said no but I worried she still has some strange attachment to this fuckwad.  She says she wanted to tell me but didn't know how


**edit**: Thanks for the support.  Those of you telling me to run away and get out, you don't just give up on it.  That's really something that's upset me about a lot of the suggestions in RA I've seen in the past.  So many of you are always so quick to tell others to just give up, break up, and move on without really knowing how this person feels about their significant other.  I'd like to think people who believe they're in love would be willing to work at it and not just throw in the towel.  There's no such thing as an easy ride.

*I get it, relationships can fail because sometimes, to a man, a relationship is like furniture - you buy it once and you use it and never think about it again.  Whereas, to a woman, sometimes, a relationship is like a living thing that needs to be tended or else it is being neglected.*

*What I think is going on with the women who are writing those posts is that these women feel the relationship is being neglected and thus she starts to thirst for signs of affection: ""I love yous, etc.   But if she wasn't feeling dissatisfied in the first place, she wouldn't fixate on these petty things.*

*Men, so small it may only take between 5 seconds and 10 minutes, but it will make a world of difference.*

Here are some ideas to get started:

(3) Once in a while, smile, and kiss her   
(4) Make-out wildly without it leading to sex    
(5) Leave her a note that she'll find later that says ""Hello
(6) When she comes home from the gym and gets in the shower
(7) Buy her a roll of Lifesavers    
(8) Once in a while plan a date
(9) If you see something she might like and it is less than $10
(10) Go to a restaurant that serves a kind of food she loves
(11) Bring her her morning coffee in bed.    
(12) Ask her what a dream vacation would be to go on together.     
(13) Tell her how much you like a special part of her body

Thank you very much for the plentiful and very considerate advice. I met with Lee today and hammered away some details

I officially declined his marriage offer and asked that he not propose again in the next year. We are officially in a committed relationship. He has agreed to the following:

* No more gifts

* He's getting his teeth fixed (he's such a dork sometimes

* Start eating healthier and exercising

* Better respect my boundaries

And here's what I agreed to:

* I'm applying for a job in another department

* I will help Lee in his quest for fitness

* I'm giving this relationship the attention and consideration it deserves. I'm not just viewing him as an old man trying to buy my love

I was panicked last night but feel really good about everything now. Thanks

I was honest and told her my feelings weren't as strong as hers, but that I wanted to give it a try. As per some advice, I took her out on a date (just dinner and a walk in the city), held her hand and basically stopped acting like a friend. It was kind of weird in the beginning, but we stopped there. I actually had a really good time.

Since then, and basically been getting closer (if that's possible). We both agreed that being open and honest was the way to go.

The other day, she told me that she had a huge epiphany to have a child.  This caught me off guard, as she seemed too mature to make a decision like this so hastily.  I don't think she'd be able to support the kid very well, she's a college student who can barely afford her loft.  She doesn't want to have it with a guy either, because as she put it every guy she's dated in the past has been an asshole and she doesn't trust the father not to walk out on her and the child.

This is really frustrating to me

 I even had the passing thought of ""donating"" my sperm to her

**EDIT:  Thanks for the huge response everyone, I agreed to consider the idea of having the baby with her.  I realize some of reddit thinks this is a bad idea, but I convinced her that it would be much better for the child to have a loving mother and father and how difficult it is for a single mother to raise a child on her own.

I know reddit isn't supposed to be a personal blog or diary

So today was the day I picked to ask her out. I'd been off work for the past few days and had made up my mind that when I got off (I work nights

Since I had a few days since my first post I really tried to not dwell on it too much. I've been plenty guilty of building things up too much

I was nervous when I got up this morning though and that had me a little concerned. I mean

What I did though was just do everything like normal. I drove to work, I wasn't really sure if this was going to take my mind off of things or not given the subject matter, but it worked.

So after working like normal, grabbed my stuff from the break room fridge and set off across the store to find her. 

Since I hadn't seen her in a few days

But still, she told me about what she had been up to and she also mentioned she had no plans this weekend.

So I asked her.

I probably could have been a bit smoother

I'm sure if my inner man raptor was more developed

Now the few times I've ever sacked up and been forward with a woman, you see, I'd like to, but ..."" sort of answers that I'm just not ""raptory"" enough to field. 

But I didn't have to worry.

In fact, her whole body seemed to light up. I don't think she could have said ""Yes"" any faster. 

Then she just right out gave me her number.

It felt **damn** good. Really damn good.

So if anyone is still reading this who had replied to my first post - thank you. This really helped me get some perspective.

Now I know I'm just going on a date, I'm just looking forward to getting to spend a fun time with someone who I like.

I'll let you all know how it goes.

Thanks again.

1291495534.0,eg917,"Hey, Forever Alone guys, here's some advice from a she-geek. ",satiredun,341,213, and I'm an observant person

First and foremost, don't try to goad her with how much you know or how much she doesn't. Don't revert to sixth grad 'I hit you I like you' type behavior. 

Second: Never, etc. Where guys get into trouble is actually being self-deprecating. It's not a good attitude to have, and even if you aren't attracted to the girl you're talking like this to, remember this: girls know other girls. A lot of times, girls *like* to hook up single friends together. And I know from experience- mine and others- that we don't want to hook a girlfriend up with someone bearing that attitude. 

Third: have a sense of humor about dating. If you don't, mean, or rude- like ditch you- try your best to laugh about it, realize they're a bitch/cunt/not worth your time, and move on. which leads me to..

Fourth: Approach a date with the expectation to have fun, or -gasp!- both- head out looking forward to getting to know them. It's sexy when a guy is having a good time, and it's obvious when they're expecting something later on. 

Fifth: to meet girls you'll like, tech parties, etc). Conventions or lectures or other 'extracurricular' activities are great places to meet girls who are into the same general things you are. Start up a conversation. Be casual. I've always been much more receptive to random conversations during these daytime or casual get-togethers than bars, clubs, or fancier parties.

and here's one more thing about first dates: Movies are shitty first dates. Don't get to fancy, or other mostly-unstructured activity where you can chat is a great idea. Why unstructured? If there's no spark, you don't have to suffer through the rest of the dinner/day/activity. You can just laugh it off, realize there's no connection, and go home. 

That's about it. I'm happy to give more advice (hah) if you ask for it. For some info: I'm a 26 year old super geeky lady. I started a soft-circuit company

TL;DR:

1. don't act like a troll

2. forever alone attitude is unsexy

3. laugh it off

4. expectations get you in trouble

5. if you don't like clubs,False,,t5_2r0cn,False,,,t3_eg917

1372541959.0,1hbxdi,Fiance kissed another guy last night and pulled a gun on me,mr_universe,277,46,213,"Reddit
I need your advice.  Last night, I am talking to a girl next to me and I look over to see my fiance kissing another guy.  I was ready to beat some ass at that point but it came to light that she initiated the kiss.  I called her out and we drove home at that point, arguing with each other the entire time.  As we pulled into the driveway, she sprinted into the house unexpectedly.  I got worried at that point but did not immediately pursue.  i decided to go in the house about two minutes later and found my fiance holding our gun, trying to put a bullet in chamber.  I walked decisively toward her and disarmed her before she could use the weapon.  I wasn't sure if she wanted to use it on me or herself; but regardless, it was completely unacceptable for her to act in that manner.  At this point, I ran upstairs and locked the weapon in the room.  She ran after me up the stairs trying to get the gun from the locked room.  She discovered that the gun was not accessible and then proceeded to try to jump down the stairs to kill herself.  I restrained her from jumping but she bit me on the arm and elbowed me in the nose.  After, ran out back

Now for the advice part.  We have been together for three years and are ready to be married in August.  There's no way we're getting married at this point and I am dead set on booting her from the house immediately.  Reddit

TLDR: Fiance freaked

UPDATE: Went and visited her in the hospital and told her that it's over between us.  the next step will be breaking apart the life we created.  Step after that will be gym, and put my life on a new path.  Silver linings. 

UPDATE 2: Her mom and brother will be here Wednesday to help her pack her things.  I'll be out of town during that time to make the transition easier.  I trust her family and know they will pack only what belongs to her.  I'll seek some therapy myself to get over this.  Thanks for the advice Reddit.  You really did help steer me on the right path. 

UPDATE 3: Some new information came to light and I feel like it is very important.  Apparently this guy kissed her and not the other way around.  I trust this and believe her in the story as she pulled away from the guy about two seconds after the kiss was initiated.  In addition
She has committed to entirely stop drinking regardless of whether or not we stay together and is committed to getting therapy for this incident.  I am still leaning toward ending the relationship but will give her the opportunity to say her peace and at least have a rational discussion.  If she had initiated the kiss, it puts me at fault for not defending her honor and browbeating her for something she did not do.  During the ride home, I told her it was over and that she's out tomorrow.  I crossed the line and pushed her over the edge.  That was no excuse for pulling a gun and that in itself is most likely the deal breaker.  But there are two sides to every story and we owe it to each other to end or mend our relationship like adults.  I'll follow up with the conclusion on Thursday.

My wife and I (married almost 5 years) hit a rough patch.  She admitted to me that she checked my email and saw an email from my ex-wife saying she (my ex) still loved me.  I got curious and looked for that email.  It was dated 2004, and pondered why I even kept it or if my wife even bothered to read it or look at the date.

So I got a hair up my but and decided to check my wife's email.  I've had no reason not to trust her...I just felt violated and decided my method to take care of the situation was to do what she did to me.  Except, boring, boring.  Almost decide to just stop and see a message from one of her friends (a female friend) she doesn't really see anymore.  I open that up and scroll through and right before they stopped talking and see just dozens of messages about how my wife is trying to plan on a vacation with her 'soul-mate'.  

The time on the messages was late last year.  I keep scrolling and learn that she has a soul-mate (SM) and it is not me.  He lives in another state.  She's talking about how she's and the SM are willing to drive half way to hook up.  She also talks about leaving me and how she hates to leave me, just have to figure out how I'm going to give hubby the news"".  

I am absolutely floored by this discovery.  Now I must believe there is this ticking time bomb on our relationship.  I feel absolutely horrible that I even saw all this

I sent my wife a text saying ""I wish I was your soul mate"".  I have not confronted her yet and she has no idea what I saw.  She replied with ""You may not be my soul mate

This is done

**tl;dr**: saw messages from my wife to one of her friends talking about how she wants to leave me for another man.  Considers me her best friend and not a soul mate.  This is my exit

**[UPDATE 5/3]:** Sorry about no updates.  I still have not talked to her about this.  I'm not trying to avoid the situation

She sent me this email last night...

*The thought of losing you makes me hurt. Really bad. I am sorry you are hurting from me and from whats going on with your dad. I want you to be there for your family, I'm sorry that things I said hurt you. I love you with all my heart and I will do anything to keep our family together. I can't change the past, but I will do my best to make it right. I love you so much. I'm sorry that saying you were my best friend made you mad, but you are my best friend, my lover, my partner, and I believe that. I want us to be together forever like I said I love you forever. please come home. please come back to me.*

She was satisfied with that reasoning.

I turned to her and the following ensued:

Me: ""How much do you love me?""
Her: ""More than anything...""
Me: ""I love you more than that.. and more than anything in this world, and I want to spend the rest of my life with you, so I have a question for you..""

I've seen so many posts on here about people who leave long term relationships, because they 'don't know who they are anymore' and 'want to see what single life is like'. Now, from what i see, most of the time people are trying to get into a relationship to escape single life, but when they get it, they seem to lose interest extremely quickly. I come from an Asian background and no on in my family has ever gotten a divorce, nor would any of them ever leave a marriage or relationship that has lasted a decade in order to 'find themselves'. Even in Indian and Arabic cultures, to be alone?
I've also noticed my Asian friends tend to remain in 1 or 2 serious relationships their entire young adulthood and then get married in their early 20's. However, to decide to end it in order to 'explore themselves' and 'have fun'. 

And what i find most baffling about all of this is that, countries where arranged marriage is rife and dating is pretty limited, the marriages seem to last much much longer (for example, Sri Lanka.) Funnily enough even countries where dating and pre marital sex is common, like Italy, also have astoundingly low divorce rates.

I have struggled financially. I have done my best to provide well for my son

I met this man, he's on the Charity Board of Directors. He comes from family money and has invested well. When he asked me out the first time I politely declined. He's 45, over-weight, and not my type. He was very persistent and I agreed to lunch. At lunch he gave me an iPod, he had asked other nurses on the floor and he found out mine was recently stolen. I tried to refuse it, but he wouldn't accept it. 

I felt obligated to him after that and didn't like it. When I attempted to return it, with a sweet note about deserving to be pampered. 

At this point he won me over. No man has ever been so thoughtful or kind to me. I went out with him again but made him promise to let me treat him. We had a nice time, it was like kissing my uncle. That night there were flowers delivered to my door with this note ""Please keep trying. I think we could be something special. I'm falling for you."". I felt terrible. I felt like I was leading him on. I planned on seeing him the next day to end it. 

But I didn't. I thought about all the losers and the men that never called after they had finally gotten me in bed. I realized this was the first time I had EVER gotten flowers. Even when my son was born... I took his advise and kept trying. We went out for a few more weeks and it was clear that he was in love with me. The gifts were still coming and he started talking about 'our future'. I decided to see if we were sexually compatible. It was pretty good

I felt like a whore. I was insulted and angry. I drove it to his house and left it there with my own note ""It's over. Leave me alone and don't even think about bringing this back"". Maybe I over-reacted. I don't know.

He called me and asked to see me one more time, and have higher education provided. I can quit or work less hours, or go back to school or sit at the pool all day. Basically, free to do as I please. He travels often and I would get to see the world. He has a vacation homes in Kona and Italy. No pre-nup either. He said that he'd expect me to be faithful, but would do everything in his power to keep me satisfied. Also, no matter what my choice; the car is mine. 

That was yesterday. There's no deadline on my decision but would like to give him a firm answer by the weekend. He wants to fly me to his parents' house on the coast to announce the engagement. The car was returned to my driveway while I am writing this. I will never be able to provide for my son like this. He'd be a good step-dad

I really don't think he wants a shiny new toy

On the negative side: I worry I will always feel beholden to him. I worry that I will feel like a prostitute. I worry that my son will sense that this is a union of convience and it will hinder his mental growth toward healthy relationships. I worry that I will never grow to love him and be resentful toward our marriage. I also have a very small worry that his family will see me for what I am and treat me poorly. I worry that I'm cheating him out of the possibility of being with someone that really loves him. I worry that I won't respect myself after.

I feel jaded, if i come back and this has happened then i am done. Thank you all for such sound advice, it kept my level head and helped me see through trapping manipulation.

Update: she deleted this guys # and is getting off this medication call busperone. Anyone have an experience with this?shes been taking it since this started. She says this is why she was acting strange and she feels normal now. I took her and my son to the zoo and we have had a great family day. Idk how i feel

Final edit: so after a counceling session, despair and sadness since then but it gets weaker everyday. Im a strong guy.(Listening to the Rat pack and plenty of beer help a ton)My gf(or ex now) is looking for work and to get her drivers license(she has been afraid to get it for years)  so, as her longtime friend and since shes my sons mother, im helping her by providing this houshold, transport and food until she is on her own.

She is as sharp as a tack, I've had very little success with the site.  There was a spark between us, and the same can be said for her..  We understood eachother's innermost thoughts and feelings.  We were able to see eachother in the deepest sense.  

The next 2 weeks were the best of my life.  The sun shined brighter, a sonnet, a confession of love.  She made me feel like the only man on Earth, and I tried my best to make her feel the same.  For the first time in 5 years, I felt like I truly mattered to somebody.

One day I received a call from her.  She was on the other line, ""I need you to be here."" So I left work and drove 3 hours to be by her side.  She was in the ICU and her kidneys were shutting down.  The next 3 weeks were spent by her side.  Through all of the pain, the tears, and suffering...we found ways to continue our love for eachother.  I quit my job for her, and I don't regret it for a second.  And there we found ourselves, just the two of us...no friends, no family.  Two 20 somethings who were complete strangers less than 2 months ago, I said I'd be a live donor.  To be given the chance to save the life of somebody so dear to you

Before I was scheduled to donate, fear, but most importantly love.  We developed a love so pure and deep that her doctors asked us if we were married...at the very least engaged.  Neither of us had the heart to tell her we had barely know eachother for 2 months.  Every day I am greeted with a gift, an artistic creation, an account of last night's dream of me...so many amazing things.  We really did act like a married couple. One day I just decided that I was going to give a name to what we were.  In her hospital bed, I proposed to her.  Navigating all of her IV tubes we embraced eachother and all words escaped us.  Finally she said ""I feel like I'm the only woman in the world."" I kept whispering, ""I love you so much.""  

So here I find myself, and we're trying to make every second of our time together as fulfilling as possible.  Fear always surfaces and I'm having increasing trouble quelling it.

So after reading the comments and adding my own, which gave me some more time to think. I got home, and gf was waiting for me, as expected. We stat on the couch and talked about what happened, and what it did to us. She apologized, stating it was a drunken night, and her swinging at me was from her picturing me penetrating friend, but right as it was about to happen, and that is what brought about her tremendous passion, and how if the roles were reversed

We stat on the couch for a bit in silence, and she walked away. So I kept to the couch for a bit, unsure of what exactly to do to make things better for me.

I went out for a cig, and what it meant to her. I asked her if she truly wanted a relationship, after everything that has been done and said. She said yes, of course. I reminded her I would not be in a good place of mind for a few days, and would not be wanting any sexual contact for a little while, with her or anyone else. She understood.

I waited a minute, let her know if she ever hit me again like that, I would be gone, no matter what. She understood, and agreed.

I gave it another minute, stern voice. I told her I when I come back to myself, I will not be begging for what I want sexually anymore. I'm a 30 year old man, and I should never have to. If she will not help me feel desired or wanted, then I will leave, and find someone who does. I do not deserve that. She got scared, and stated she would be worried I would leave her at any minute, we both are grown adults

The past 7 months have had a lot of ups and downs.  I'm in a much better place than I used to be

I have a large pool of friends now.  The friends that I spent New Years Eve with hang out every Tuesday for trivia, unrelated to these posts.  We text every day and hang out every other night, and if one of us absent for more than two days we miss each other a lot.

I took a trip to Puerto Rico with my mom and my Aunt back in May

As for my ex - the easiest, that requires 18 months of living in separate residences while not having sex with each other.  No problem there, 6 months down, 12 to go.  I look forward to the day she no longer disgraces my last name.  There is so much she is still lying to me about and so much I will never know the truth about.

For a while we talked about spending time apart and after a while see if there was something there to save.  She called me to meet with her a few months later and after a long and deceitful amount of small talk she told me she had given up.  She no longer wanted me back, good for her.  She will either wake up one day and realize how much better her life could have been with me, or she'll have a better life with this guy.  Either way, I never would have wanted to hold her back from a higher state of happiness.  In the meantime, I never want to see her again, outside of a courtroom.

To cope with my deflated ego, and took my new body to college parties.  I went on dates with old friends I hadn't seen in 5 years.  I slept around, with girls as old as 30 and as young as 18.  To be perfectly honest, none of that made me feel any better.  I thought that I wanted to feel young again and sow my wild oats, but the truth is I just wanted to be loved.

So I'm actually dating someone right now.  We connect deeply on a mental and physical level, while still having someone who cares for me and goes out with me a few times a week.  Will it last?  Don't know, don't care.  Living in the moment has been one of my coping mechanisms this year, so long as I live responsibly.  When I'm with her, I'm happy, and that's all I care about.

So this is getting long, but the show of compassion and empathy from strangers has been truly heartwarming.  I like the new me, and I hope to be better for the experience.

I could use the practice, and it wouldn't hurt to become friends with her,"" but I was intimidated and barely spoke to her. The class we had together ended, and I figured I'd never see her again. Fine by me.

Then, we were talking on facebook, making inside jokes, and even watching movies together at my house... but she still had a boyfriend, and I wouldn't help a girl cheat. While we still flirted, we were, by definition

Eventually, I recommended trying to communicate, trying to make it clear to him how uncomfortable that would make her, etc.

Over the summer, while her boyfriend ignored her (since she was out of the country). When she finally returned, after having ignored her all summer long, he tried to make a move on her the first time he saw her. It became clear what she needed to do.

A couple days ago, talking, laughing, enjoying each other--and I kissed her.

The problem? I'm gay.

I'm physically attracted to men and not women

I didn't get the opportunity to tell her. We started making out passionately and before long, and it quickly became apparent that she did, too. It makes absolutely not sense to me, but it was all I could do not to try to seduce her right there.

I've never been physically attracted to girls, and that I have such strong feelings for her. I wanted to make her feel amazing. I could've, and that idea caused me to be almost the most aroused I'd ever been in my whole life.

So I asked her out. She's my girlfriend now, as much as it feels like I'm living in a wonderful, impossible dream, I've constantly got a sinking feeling in my stomach. I have to tell her that I'm... what? Gay? Bisexual? Gay but attracted to her? All I know is that I have to tell her, but I don't know WHAT to tell her.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Hello Reddit. Wow, boots etc I said out of anger - not because I hate poor people. Money does mean a lot to me but my ex-girlfriend meant a lot more. Family, friends, loved ones all come above my work.

So it's been about a week now since it happened and I can just say this Reddit - I'm heartbroken. I was angry and confused last time I posted but now I'm just lonely and devastated. I've been taking long walks in the evening

The day after I posted on Reddit I met up with her at a Starbucks to find out some answers to my question - **Why?**. The truth is she didn't have any. She said that she didn't know why she did it. That she does love me and that she does want to marry me but that sometimes when she was with me lately she just didn't feel like she really wanted to be there. Then I said that I feel like that sometimes but I don't go out and fuck waitresses. The she turned and went all crazy - saying I'm too possessive and that she should have some freedom. She said that cheating happens everyday and  I shouldn't take it so personal. I couldn't believe what I was hearing. Then the tears came. And then the begging. I asked her what it is she loved about me and she couldn't say anything beyond the standard clichés. I listed off a huge string of things about her and finally said ""Those where things I love**ed** about you."" I told her how betrayed I felt. How I never imagined being in another relationship apart from ours in my whole life ever again. I told her that this was probably the worst thing that anyone had done to me personally in my whole life. Her tears set me off and before I knew it we're two bawling idiots sat in Starbucks with everyone looking at us. Finally I told her that despite how destroyed I was now - that there were some signs that it was coming anyway. I told her that I don't think she felt the same way about the relationship as I did - at least not in the last year. She was still crying and I said: *""Joanne

Since then well, smelling her perfume walking past a chick in town, seeing her shampoo in the shower, coming across pictures on my computer. All of it takes a toll.

She's got a great family and a brother I go fishing with every weekend and I'm becoming pretty close with them.  We've gotten in a few fights (that weren't that big) which admittedly involved an ex- of mine who I see somewhat often because of mutual friends


Anyway, everything has been great until the other day.  My girlfriend is visiting a friend and is away for a few days so I've been going over to her place to feed her fish.  Well, I was rummaging through her freezer which is a mess with boxes and crap looking for some ice pops that might have gotten lost when I found a rolled up plastic sandwich bag.  At first I thought it was pot and was sort of surprised because neither of us smoke marijuana but when I opened it up I found a disposed condom that had been tied with a knot.  Admittedly this is how I dispose of the condoms after we have sex.  I tie it off and throw it in the trash.  That means she dug it out of the trash and put it in the freezer.


I have no clue what to make of this but it's distressing.  The only thing I can think is she's saving it to get herself pregnant.  Is this even possible?  What should I do?  


**edit**: Thanks for all the comments and feedback. I've decided not to say anything about it to her until she gets back but that's not until tomorrow evening and she's definitely going to text or call me tomorrow (I texted her saying I'm tired and going to bed.. she's out at a bar so too busy to want to talk fortunately) but she's gonna call me tomorrow.  I'm going to try and act normal and ask her when she gets back.


In response to some of the comments:  As I said


I'm not 100% sure it's mine but like I said, we always sleep together when we're not away, whether it's my place or her place.  I can't imagine she'd be cheating as I don't know when that could take place.  It might be old.. it's hard to really know.  It definitely looks like the condoms I toss but that's not saying much I suppose.  I don't think I could pick my condom out of a lineup.


I can't imagine she wants to use it to frame me for sexual assault.  We've been together for a year and know each other's families.. it just doesn't make sense.

I thought we were happy. How does one cheat on someone they love? And is there any coming back from this?

He's so ashamed, will do whatever it takes to make it right, blah blah blah. As of yet, the wedding is ""postponed indefinitely"", but that's only until I can figure out something to tell my mom.

Known her for 10 years, while I was making dinner in the kitchen, my wife approaches me and tells me she made out with a girl. I was heavy in to my cooking so I couldn't really just stop what I was doing and take in everything that was said. I was more like-

..*""..oh
her: *""so what do you think?""*
me: *""why are you telling me this now?""*
her: *""so you wouldn't be able to walk out on me""*
me: *""why would I do that?""*

I fucked up right there. I didn't really convey what I was truly feeling (which was confusion) and it led to her thinking I was alright with it. From there she began to downplay her ""experiment"" saying that they were watching a movie and starting making out. She showed me the hickies and confessed that part of why I was finding out was because she wouldn't be able to hide them (huge red flag

I recall times where she mentions she was always curious about women and I, after a bit of delay, my foresight kicks in and I begin visualizing problems that can arise from this. 

* She may realize how much she likes being with this girl more than she does with me. 
* This may be something I will hold against her if I ever fuck up myself in the marriage
* Bringing STD's in from her other ""partner"".
* I work a lot of nights and travel for business. I'm worried she will become unsupportive of me when I'm homesick and I'll obsess about who she might be with. 

I bring up all four points to her explaining in detail of each one. Somehow, dinner is served and we called it a night.

**Last Week:**

We go out to a friend's party at a local venue. I disappear outside with a friend for a smoke but when I get back

It finally hits home that this may not be a fling and seeing it was obviously worse than just hearing about it. I'm kind of angered/ heart-broken that my wife would leave my side to make out with her girlfriend. Night was ruined

**Last Night:**

She stands me up as I wait for her to get home so we can watch a movie. I call her and she tells me she's hanging out with people and she forgot. It's not like her to forget and I knew what she was really doing. I'm left waiting until late at night until she finally gets home. From there I let it all out, that this wasn't going to end now and she wants to live the life she wants to live. I had no control, I got that. It escalated from there and somehow we ended up talking about living separately and possibly a divorce. There is more to this part that I'll put at the end.. it's just more sob story b.s. 

**Start emotional ramble:**
I don't know what to do or if I can even find anyone to relate with. I feel pretty alone in this and would like some input. I love her very much and I'll admit, sneaks out at night) and it's starting to eat away at me. A part of me is willing to end it because I just can't stomach the hiding and the lies. I told her I wished she was more open with what she was doing and maybe I'd be more accepting of it.



**TL;DR:** Despite what you may think

edit: I realize she may stumble upon this because I don't think there are many ""wife is leaving me for a chick"" posts around.

She goes to the concert and they wait outside near the band bus after the show is over.  The bassist from the band starts to talk to her

Now our new years eve plans are ruined, this is her favorite band, and I don't want her holding this over my head for the rest of our lives, so I let her make the decision herself.  She decides to go with her friend from work (who she now says she's only 80% sure he's gay, WTF?).

She texts me on the long drive there.  Then when she gets the tickets, and she says she is waiting at the subway station to go back to HER hotel.  She eventually gets home around 4:30 pm.  

I ask her how it went, and that she must have slept in the band suite (what?).  She blames her amnesia on a hangover.

Fast forward a day or so.  She gets out of the shower, it's a present for me!  She left for work and I found a package of summer's eve feminine wipes in her overnight bag.  Here's the other thing, I've always secretly thought she's had an odor problem, but she's certainly never done anything about it for me.  This was a brand new pack, why did she have them?

So what do you think?  Is she cheating?  With the bassist

**TL;DR - Wife goes to a concert with a guy from work on NYE.  Stays up all night in band suite.  Can't get her story straight.  Abnormal attention to vaginal hygiene.**

Edit: Sorry this is such a horrible read.  I'm literally shaking as I writing this since I don't know what to do.

Edit 2: This is a fucked up situation for sure.  But I should mention there's a reason we got married.  She and I share an affinity for so many things

Edit 3:  I think I should clarify that she got the concert tickets as a Christmas gift

Edit 4:  I'm trying to avoid keywords that might lead her to this thread

Edit 5:  She'll be home soon.  Wish me luck.

**Update:**  I sat her down last night for a talk.  I asked her to walk me through the night so I could better understand the details.  They had tickets waiting at will call, so she wasn't wearing her dress when she went up there.  It was a pretty large party, with the bassist, guitarist, cellist from the opening band, and the entire road crew.  She said her friend from work was hovering around her all night, to the point of being annoying.  She said she fell asleep on the floor of the living room

I asked her why she shaved, but said she bought them during our last Walmart shopping trip, which was the day after Christmas.  If that's true, she couldn't have known she was sleeping out without me on NYE.  She said she didn't even open them.  When I checked the package again, I was positive it was unopened.

I asked her to look me in the eyes and swear that there was no kissing, repeating those exact words.

I also told her how hurt I was about the whole situation.  I told her that if she has tickets to something, then she wasn't ready for marriage.  She was very resistant and used a lot of hyperbole in the conversation (you always this, I never that).  The most hurtful thing she said to me was that if I was able to go on NYE, she thinks she wouldn't have had as much fun.  I told her that's a fundamental blow to our relationship that should call our marriage into question.  She said I was being ridiculous.

So I'm pretty much right back where I started.  Still not sure if she cheated.  It's possible she lied.  I have no way of knowing.  She's acting pretty much normal at home,,False,,t5_2r0cn,True,,True

&gt;Sound advice. I'm 32 now, as you young people say. I have quite a bit to say on the matter Moridyn brings up, but I will try to start with some brief points.

&gt;The most important things to know about pleasing a woman (a list of perhaps a dozen important things

&gt;1. Comfort. A lot of her orgasm depends on her mental state, her breath, what you think of what she's wearing, if she did or said anything foolish... You need to make her feel totally comfortable and un-judged. Make her feel safe and protected. You are cool, confident and in control. Let her see that, and let her see that you approve of her and see her as desirable and sexy.

&gt;2. Audible feedback: moans

&gt;3. Every girl is different



&gt;     Explore, once you're in the act. While every girl wants to be respected, she also want you to be shocked and pleased by what a dirty little whore she can be. When she's feeling confident, she also wants to feel manhandled and used. It's a different line for every girl, so you have to be careful and pay attention while riding it.

&gt;4. Keep sex friendly. Whether it's casual or serious

&gt;5. If you have any lesbian friends, learn through trial and error. Push up the skin on either side of the hood, at the top of the vaginal opening to expose the clitoris. Hold like this to increase blood flow to the area and intensify physical sensation and strength of orgasm. Place your upper lip against the pubis just north of the clit with a bit of pressure. Make your tongue flat and wide, then touch the clit using constant contact. make small steady downward thrusting motions with your tongue, don't lick it up--that's like rubbing a cat's fur the wrong way. Keep the rhythm and pressure steady. Her moans will cue you in about when to go faster. Just follow her rhythm when her tempo speeds. If you slip a bit, you can place your entire mouth around the clit and suck for awhile, but don't change things up too much, now is the time to stop licking or it will be painfully intense and she'll shove you away. Instead




&gt;    This is general advice

&gt;6. Most breakups happen because things about you and things about her are bringing out bad qualities in each other. That doesn't mean she's a crazy fucking bitch




&gt;    If you've gotta break her heart, and don't be passive aggressive. Tell her you wish things were different, but it's just not working out and you want to end it. Don't let her drag you into a fight or put you on the defensive. Tell her that things are too emotional right now to have a worthwhile discussion, and when you're both able to talk it out calmly, you'll be willing to talk it out with her, just not now.



&gt;    At your age, and so they don't have mental scars from past boyfriends to project onto your every word and action. The more careful you are with each heart, the more of them will survive into their twenties or even thirties without becoming completely cynical and jaded.

&gt;7. You are probably not going to meet a girl you should marry before you're through college. It's not that you won't find someone to love intensely, and love freely, and let love go freely, too. Be graceful about it. 

&gt;8. Sometimes the plain girls are unbelievably better in bed than the hot ones. Not always, girls talk. If you treat her right, every single girl she knows will know just how good in bed you are. This has serious advantages in the long run.

&gt;9. Don't be afraid of them. Being rejected happens, sometimes you'll just cut your losses, but always show dignity, grace and class. If a girl tries to make you feel small for asking her out, she just did you a favor. 




&gt;    She showed you that you can do a lot better than her before you even wasted a dime on her. That's one girl off your list

&gt;10. Have fun. The goal should never be to score, it will lead to a lot more sex than trying to score ever did.

&gt;11. Girls appreciate little creative romantic gestures. There are all sorts of things you can do. Simple, just test it out on yourself first to make sure you're not going to burn the shit out of the poor girl. A water glass with ice cubes in the summer makes another awesome, free sex toy. Reach over partway through and rub a piece of ice down her sweaty body, around her nipples, across her lips.




&gt;    Girls loves notes or poems folded into origami. Learn how to make a napkin into a rose. Maybe learn a couple magic tricks. Often florists will sweep up fallen rose petals and bag them for you, tie a weighted bead to the bottom so it hangs straight, then use a hot glue gun to glue rose petals around it in a spiral, making a spinning stream of rose petals.




&gt;    I explained this plan to a woman at a flower shop once. She gave me ten dozen roses worth of petals for free




&gt;    You can do much simpler things. Girls love to steal a piece of clothing that smells like you. Girls are very smell-oriented creatures. Pick a nice cologne




&gt;    Cook for her. Write her a song. Take her on a picnic. Spread a blanket by a lake and play the song for her on your guitar. Take up photography. Take her picture. Learn to draw or paint. Get her to pose for you. You have all of these options.

&gt;12\. Don't let the bastards grind you down. 




&gt;    Your heart will be broken. You will feel cynical and jaded. You'll feel like you've been made a fool. You'll demand an explanation. You'll tell yourself you'll never let another girl make you feel this way again. You'll feel misogynistic and make nasty statements about women. You'll listen to angry music and write breakup poetry




&gt;    Try to keep the perspective proper. There's a great line from the movie Suicide Kings. Sean Patrick Flannery is telling Christopher Walken about how amazing his girlfriend is.




&gt;Sean Patrick Flannery:  She's the kind of woman that'd make your heart stop. And then start it back up again. You know any women like that? 



&gt;Christopher Fucking Walken: *Yeah*. All of them.

I agree that rape is a harsh word as I don't think he had any intention of really hurting me and it wasn't violent. Plus he could have been fairly drunk.  The reason I pretended to be black out is because I had woken up the week before sore (like from having sex) and didn't remember doing it (after a night of drinking).  I asked him if we had sex and he said yes. I asked him if I had been passed out and he said he didn't know. I wanted to see if it would happen again. 

I really do love him which is why it is hard to classify this as rape. I just didn't know if this happens to other people.

This morning

My wife woke up at 8:30 in a panic because she hadn't checked her calendar to see that her youngest child has an appointment with a doctor (specialist - hard to get in to see) today. The child is already at school. The appointment is at 9am.

She throws on clothes and starts frantically getting ready. I ask her ""what can I do to help?"" She says ""find my purse""

She asks me if I can ""do Lucky"" (a job where we go to someone's house that we used to pet sit for and cycle their blinds and lights because the client is in the process of moving). I say yes and I walk her to the car (carrying her stuff for her) to get the keys from her. I kiss her goodbye

Before I get in the shower my phone rings. Its my wife. She's asking where the child's hand brace is. I say I don't know. She tells me where to look and I find it. Now she's pissed because she needs it for the appointment. I say ""Do you want me to meet you in the driveway with it? Do you need me to drive it to the appointment? Should I delay my shower?"" She says

I shower. I get out of the shower. I check my phone. Several texts from her. The last one says ""here!"".

I look out the window, no shoes still dripping wet. It is cold outside. She says ""Can you help me..."" (looks at me in the towel) ""...no you can't.""

I go inside, ""Shit!"" and ""I need you!!"" ""Right now, pls!!"".

I text back, pants. Just as I'm tying my shoes the phone rings. Its her. She's pissed because I texted ""What do you need?"". I was intending to ask her if she needed me to *bring* her something from in the house. She is pissed because I didn't help her move the child and her things back and forth between the two cars which she ""wasted several minutes on"" which is my fault because I didn't remind her that her car has a flat tire before she moved her things. I asked her, ""did you expect me to just come outside in my towel again not even knowing what you want?"" She said ""yes"". Ugh.

So, etc. as she drives to the 9am doctors appointment. I remind her that its now 9:03 and I have to be at work for a 9:30 meeting AND I have to stop and ""do lucky"" for her.

I agree that our life is complicated. Especially hers because she does different things every day. She doesn't just get up and go to the same place each day. Kids have appointments. There is soccer practice. One kid is disabled and has extra appointments. We also run multiple businesses. The car she was driving that was ""out of gas"" was purchased to rent through car sharing websites and I really prefer she not drive it

The car with the flat tire just needs to be aired up.

Also

This is very stressful and I was late to work. I don't want to piss her off, it will make her think I don't want to help her. I do want to help her, but I don't like just being blindsided by endless random requests that are demanded hatefully.

I have no idea how to react.",cptgreatcpt,198,151, his wife is 21/f. I've know him since I was 5 and they have been married for almost 4 years. I've only gotten to really know her in the last 8 months or so.

A week ago I went to a bar with the two of them and around 12 my friend had to go home so it was just me and his wife. We decided to go dancing which started out innocent enough. But after a few drinks she starts getting pretty dirty. She could tell I was uncomfortable so reassured me that my friend was ok with it. An hour later of sweaty grinding the bars close. 

So we walk back to my car, how if she wasn't married she would have sex with me. How she wishes she could just marry both of us. She kept saying that she loved me but she still loved my best friend too, just in a different way. I lay awake in bed all night just repeating ""fuck"" in my head over and over again.

The next day she calls me and asks to meet up to talk about everything. This is when things get mind-blowing in my opinion. She talked to my friend about how she felt and supposedly

I asked what exactly the relationship would be seeing as how we couldn't be physical

I tell her I have to think about it. Really my mind is just full of fuck. She seemed shocked that I didn't just jump right in. She said she wasn't expecting me to hesitate the way I did. I can't honestly believe she proposed this to me.

Seriously what on earth am I supposed to do? I should say that although I'm physically attracted and (not so much anymore) emotionally attracted to her I have no interest at all in this proposal. I have yet to talk to my friend about it. I feel like she's requesting the most selfish type of relationship you could have. She gets two guys and expects me to stay close with her in case theres a chance we may get to have sex? Why on earth would I agree to that? The worse part is she genuinely feels like this is a good thing. She would truly feel broken hearted if I said no. In her mind there is nothing unnatural about this and she fully expects that it would work. 

So I guess what I'm asking for is advice on how to say no without ruining my friendship and without creating drama. Also any general opinions or thoughts would be appreciated. I hope this is all coherent and it doesn't sound like I'm rambling. I'm still trying to sort it all out and I'm not the greatest writer out there.

Edit-----------------------------------

 Ok so i figured I would do a follow up for those interested. I talked to my friend alone and told him I felt weird about it and that she mentioned long term wanting to get more physical i.e. sex. turns out she didnt mention that part. He seems to be in a bit of a denial state. Saying things like well I don't think she would ever do that.  He was ok with cuddling and danceing stuff but thats about it. He knows she can be a little crazy

Later I talked to her. Or I should say tried. It felt like I was talking to a brick wall. I told her I wasnt comftorable with the situation and that I just wanted things to be the way they are. I didn't want to be alone with her and I couldn't dance with her anymore. I figured I would try to resolve it without just cutting her off. She kept trying to convince me to just give it a try. Saying my friend was ok with etc etc. we talked im circles for about 10 minutes before I realized it was futile to reason. 

So unfortunately im going with option B. It's only been 15 hours since our conversation but im essentially cutting her off. I'm sure ill still see her but only when shes with my friend. shes texted me twice today but I havent answered. Shit sucks

On a related note some people are saying i'm being closed minded in all of this. I have nothing against poly relationships. But she chose to marry into a monogamous one and I don't think my friends is ok the fact she now wants to change. She is also not telling my friend the whole truth. 

So there you have it. Sorry for typos and bad format im on my  phone and im lazy.

So, along with about 12 other people, and we helped her move all of her things out along with my little brothers and sisters things. She's moving in to a house about 30 minutes away from me, and she can't be happier. She told him if he made the effort to work on things she would give him another shot. He hasn't and she is actually relieved. At first she was really emotional about the whole thing... Saying how she didn't know if she could do it. But I kept telling her as soon as she had her freedom she would wonder why she stayed so long, and I was right.    

Since then some people have confessed that the only reason they didn't tell her about the affair was because he was telling everyone that they had an open relationship. She's really embarrassed

The other girl has been calling my mom and saying how that's her bar now and how much she loves him. Most times she's drunk and my mom has stopped answering

The worst thing that came out of this though, but I won't say which one because I feel bad for her.. she also contracted an STI from him as well, which is being treated right now.   

I'm happy to say this is a new beginning for our family and I'm happy to never have to see or hear from him again. She's over him and over his sociopathic tendencies.

1297743769.0,flm1q,What's worse than being Forever Alone on V-Day? Let me tell you.,worsethanalone,206,42,196,"TL;DR up front - married for 8 years

Background: we've been married for 8 years. We have 2 kids. The past 3 years have been incredibly trying for me. 

In this time, I stayed up late making a crafty valentine which she ended up tossing aside and which got buried under a pile of papers and junk mail on the desk. For my birthday, we went out to a restaurant and she told me that she ""thought"" about getting me an iPad, but then changed her mind. Gee, thanks for the ""thought"" about getting a gift with our money.

In addition, token attempts every 2-3 weeks or so. I take care of all of my own laundry and the kids laundry, sweep the floors, mop, and general pick-up. Her dirty clothes cover various areas of our bedroom and closet. I used to wash and put away her clothes too, but she insisted that I wasn't doing it right and was causing spots or other problems with the clothes, so I stopped doing anything with them.

No sex in 11 months. 1 year is closing in. This isn't due to any great betrayal or insensitivity on my part. I'm an affectionate person at heart

Somewhere about 1 1/2 to 2 years ago, and from that point forward there has been almost no physical contact whatsoever.

 I have to keep reminding myself that 'this is not normal' because nobody else in the world has to put up with this kind of treatment to be in a relationship. My memories of all the good times we once had are almost repressed - it hurts to think about what once was.

We went to counseling. My opinion on this is complex - I have always felt that the only way for two people to work out an issue is to talk between those two people with mutual respect. I don't think a counsellor is necessary just to talk

Week after week, and I haven't had a chance to call the counsellor to reschedule - he has no office staff and works by voicemails, so it is a pain to call and schedule a time with him, and she won't take the initiative to do it for us.

She gave me a card for Xmas which gave me the slightest hope that she actually cared about me. We had a dramatic conversation a few weeks ago where I sent the kids over to the grandparents house for the night, a lot of emotions from the past came out, and after a long emotional battle she finally told me that she was willing to try to fix things with me, but it was going to take 'baby steps'.

I tried to make some of those baby steps for V-day by doing the right thing - I ran out Sunday night and got a dozen roses

I put the roses in a crystal vase we already had

I woke in the morning - to nothing. No happy V-day said, no thank you for the flowers. I helped to get the kids ready and out the door, she said goodbye and left. I never really expected her to plan ahead, but I thought at least she would use her time during the day to try to do something to show me I still mattered to her.

When I finally got home - nothing. The only thing she 'got' me was a free ecard that she sent to my work email at the end of the day just before 7pm when I was on my way home. No greeting, I'll get up."" She gets up and lets me take the seat to finish my last few bites of pizza, rather than cleaning off the table and being hospitable to me in the first place.

I eat and I clean up

It's time to put the kids in bed

I've been through this 1, and how she just doesn't have the time to do anything for me for V-day, and how *dare* I criticize her for that. This is one of her little defense techniques, turning around whatever hurt she's caused through her actions and pretending like she's the one who needs an apology.

I say ""No

She basically headed straight for bed while I put the kids on bed. Lights out and straight to sleep for her. I put the kids to bed

My heart hurts like you wouldn't believe. I have been through so much and I haven't gotten anything out of this relationship in *years*. She said she would take baby steps, she should just choose divorce - move on, make both of us happier. But she seems intent on using me for all I'm worth, while extending nothing to me in terms of benefit from this relationship. 

I have supported her in everything she has done - in the past 5 years I supported the whole family while she went back to school and started a new career

There's more that has happened in the past 3 years but I can hardly sum it up. I'm just totally broken by the V-day experience. Our anniversary is coming up and I am wondering if it is even worth bothering to get an anniversary gift.

Sorry if this is rambling, and now she can't even be bothered to show me the slightest affection. WTF am I missing?

I saw he wasn't doing the dishes

This is the problem with my DH.  Around other people he is pretty docile.  I've had friends comment about him being an asshole

So last night, saying the ticket is my responsibility and he shouldn't have to pay for it, and he starts SCREAMING at me about how I've been nothing but a bitch all week to him about doing the dishes, and about how I don't do fucking anything around here. (I guess cleaning, laundry, childcare, and working full-time is me not doing anything)

I remained calm and told him that I wasn't asking him to pay my ticket

He keeps yelling at me and calling me a stupid bitch

His reaction was as follows: Grabbing me by the throat until I couldn't see and throwing me on the ground.  I got up to defend myself and he put me in a full nelson while I screamed at him to let me go.  When he finally did

(Side note: our infant is in the next room wailing while this is happening)

I sat in the bedroom and cried for a few minutes

""Get the fuck out of here

2) Who the hell is he to tell me where I can and cannot go in my own home?

I am so conflicted

This is not the first time he has laid hands on me, besides the pushing and kicking to get away. 

The worst part is he didn't leave bruises.  I'm sore all over, but there is nothing concrete enough for me to tell the police.  No one would believe me because I don't have proof.  Sometimes I wish he would break my nose, or give me a black eye, anything that would indicate he had hit me, so I could go to the police and they would take me seriously.

Four men.  She had an affair with four different men over the past five months.  

The first was a guy from work she start sexting and sending racy pictures to back in october.  Then she met a random guy at a concert and kissed him.  She met up with him again when she was at a drive-in movie theater with a friend, they fought, and broke off contact after that.

One night in mid december I came home from work at 6pm, an hour and a half later, the police were in my living room, and I was giving them her description.  I held her so tightly.  I was so scared that something had happened to her.  I was in tears.  A minute earlier, she was making out with the guy from work, in his car, down the street, she would have had sex with him.

Then theres new years eve.  The bassist guy likes it up the ass.  When my wife and her gay friend went up to his hotel room, and then the guy told him to get lost.  He then had unprotected sex with her, with possible vaginal insemination.  She took the morning after pill, and had a pregnancy scare when she was late for her period.  They continued to chat via text/email/video chat after that.

Finally, and she found that to be the better option.  As far as I know, she never met the guy.

She continued to flirt and chat with three of the four men up until last wednesday when I found out.  I only found out about the other two yesterday

I know this doesn't count as verification

I could never hurt or kill myself.  But believe me when I say I wish I was dead.  I wouldn't wish this pain on someone I hate.  I'm weak.  I'm exhausted.  I can't eat or sleep.  I miss her so bad but I'm repulsed by her at the same time.  I told her not to even be in the same room as me until she gets tested for STDs.  I told her to email her entire family and tell them everything she did.  She has a very tight family and this will likely shame her for life.  I told her she needs to cut all ties with everyone and burn every bridge, it's very likely that there's nothing to save.  

I feel so alone.  I have friends that I've been relying on, I am in no condition for a new relationship, and there is no way I could be intimate with this woman again.  Everything I had was just ripped away.

I need some cheering up.  Again

EDIT:  She had sex with the guy from work.  I'm fucking done.  Its over.  I didn't make her write any letters or tell anyone.  She can rot for all I care.  I'm free from this bullshit.  Anyone for a beer?

She planned it out in advance, and no one has showed up.  All this morning she spent time cleaning up the living room, setting up her entire display, and buying and making refreshments just in case someone showed... and, no one showed.  I feel so sad for her.  She told me she was going upstairs to take a nap... which is probably true but I can tell she wants her alone time as well.

This is one of those times where I need to say the right thing to her.  This sucks... She put so much ton of time and energy in this event

**EDIT: Reddit, but I didn't even think about it at the time.  I surprised her with it, and told her how sorry I was that her event didn't go as planned.  She wept pretty hard for a moment as I held her, but I think that actually helped her get the remaining sadness out of her system.... because after that, we started playing with the kids until it as their bedtime.  Then we just laughed and joked for the last few hours.  She's upstairs right now learning to create a blog or something.

My career is in computers and her understanding of computers is limited to browsing

She has the standard complaints: She's bored at home. I'm not exciting enough anymore. We never go anywhere.  We never seem to have enough money.  In my defense I'll admit the the responsibility of being the sole financial support for six people (and two dogs) makes me a little more dull than I used to be.  Having to do things like pay for the mortgage, utilites and whatnot tend to do that.  I will freely admit that I am quite a bit less reckless than I was in my Harley riding, motocross racing, beer chugging college days (when we dated).  'We never go anywhere' apparently ignores the 2-3 family vacations we take each year.  I suspect she wants to lock the kids in the basement and head to Vegas for a week.  As for the 'never enough money', the disparity in the comparison between our house/lifestyle to her two-income friends never seems to dawn on her.

As I mentioned before

I'm torn about what to do here.  Part of me wants to step in and stop it (we have four kids dammit!) but to be honest

And since I know it will probably come up:

Sex: Very regular and surprising very good.  5-6 times a week at least and she is multi-orgasmic (no

Going out: I'm sure someone will ask why I haven't planned our going someplace 'special' with her.  We did before kids.  Alot.  But now I ask....  why hasn't she planned something?  She's the one who's home all day in front of the computer.  Would it kill her to put any effort forth?

So what do you think reddit....  stop it or let it go?

**edit:** Ok reddit

Two things I'll add:
 
- I never saw the original add.  I think she deleted it (or someone flagged) when the flood of messages came in.  All I know it the bits and pieces that were copied into some of the email messages (and they were pretty graphic).  The idea of replying to the ad myself is... interesting but now impossible.

- The 'no more excitement' thing is really setting me off.  Mainly because SHE'S the one who wanted me to get rid of the Harley when we started having kids...  because it wasn't safe.  Go figure.

**FINAL EDIT:**  Holy CRAP!  I can't believe the response this received.  Thanks Reddit.  You've been a huge help.

- The Camry never made it home last night.  In its place is an F-150....  with a cycle trailer attached (no cycles though.  yet.)  She came out with a 'what the hell' look when I pulled in.  I said something along the lines of 'What?  I wanted a truck.' and she made some comment about this being the first impulsive thing I've done in 10 years.

I might be a little OCD, have to leave the room. In the first 2 years of our relationship, I would often bring it up in the nicest way possible. The only way I know how to do that is the way my mom would tell me: ""Baby, sorry, try to chew with your mouth closed."" She nods in agreement and makes an adorable concerted effort to do so for the rest of the meal. I almost wish she was punk and defensive about it, so I wouldn't feel guilty. Problem is, she needs reminding for every meal. I gave up a while ago because I start feeling like a dickhead dictator. It just won't take. So now, I sit at the table while she sits at the couch. ""Sit with me,"" as I wait for us to both finish our dinner. Usually, walk around

Having eaten with her family a hundred times now, audibly mixing everything with his saliva, as if he were giving a performance of his opinion of every bite. You can hear him from the next room. It's so bad that I regularly decline her invitations/insistences to have dinner with her folks.

**EDIT:** A few people have posted replies that suggest they think I'm referring to some objective standard of beauty.  I am most definitely not.  ""Remain attractive *to each other*"" means just that.

----

Several years ago

The relationship continued for three years.

At the beginning, very intelligent and we had fantastic conversations and fun together.  And she was fit (although not tiny / super skinny) and I was very attracted to her.  Our sex was terrific.

I should add (for full disclosure, embarked on a fairly serious fitness program.  I was (and am) in good shape when she and I met - reasonable muscle although not overly built, ""athletic,"" I guess - and I generally find people attractive who also take care of themselves.

Over a couple years, but we only saw each other one a week or every two weeks, and it was clear she was not being particularly active when we weren't together.  She began to put on weight.

At first, and that began to affect other things in our relationship.  She knew something was wrong, and even though we still had great mental chemistry, the physical part just wasn't there.

Finally, and rather promptly decided that we needed to break up (which we did).  It wasn't the worst breakup I've ever had, and she recently got married, and I'm very happy for her.

When I told her what I told her

That seems like kind of an empty promise, and that I'm very likely going to continue to exercise regularly and do my best to stay in good condition, both because I knew it was attractive to her, and because it's a part of who I am.

My opinion on the matter is that adult relationships are both sexual and mental, and should have enough respect for their partner to make an effort for that person.

To my mind, and disrespectful to abdicate any responsibility for one's own appearance by claiming that your partner should love you, regardless.

Now, I think *both* partners have a responsibility to each other and to the relationship to not become complacent and just assume that whatever happens, the other person will love them regardless.

Am I making any sense here

I found out on the 30th of December that my wife was having an affair with one of my good friends from February until October.  They had sex a half dozen times; they had sex less than 48 hours after we returned from Hawaii.  My wife started pulling away from him immediately after that

There are a few factors here that make things worse.  This guy was my hunting partner; we spent a lot of time together.  He planned my bachelor party.  He used things that I trusted him with to get closer to my wife.  He was relentless; I've seen the text messages and had my wife explain to me what happened.  I cheated on her very early in our relationship with a girl.  I immediately told her the very next day and I thought we'd worked through it.

The last 9 days have been so hard I cannot express it.  I had to leave my job for the week because I just wound up crying in the bathroom every hour.  We had an emergency counselling session last week and it helped me a lot.  My wife and I are sharing more, and that she needs some of my time.  The counsellor recommended that I don't talk to her.

I feel like I don't have a real choice in this situation.  She's pregnant with my baby (I am as sure that it's mine as anything, even though a large part of me feels that letting this go isn't doing right by myself.

Well I'd be lying if I said that didn't suck.. not sure which hurts worse

He didn't do quite what I predicted.. instead of making me the bad guy and using her as an excuse.. he pretty much stuck with the excuse of being broke.. which I told him was complete bullshit and there is noway in hell she is his only option.. to which he replied after arguing for a bit.. that he was taking the easy way out. 

He adamantly denied that it had anything at all to do with her and that she would never be home and will be giving him $300 a month.. more arguing about why her blah blah.. went in circles.. he then uses the argument that he hates asking anyone for help more then anything - I say you never once asked me for any kind of help whatsoever and I've been your girlfriend for 2 fucking years yet you turn to your ex - he then asks me if he would have asked me to move in would I have.. fucking seriously?? this is when I can't take anymore.. I gave him back my key to his place

Unfortunately the one kind of big flaw in my plan was drinking an entire bottle of wine in a very short period of time and not eating. Clearly I couldn't drive.. I sat outside on his porch and cried for a long time, I sit on the couch and cry.. trying to sober up.. he tries to comfort me and I push him away - finally I basically said you've clearly already made your choice.. you chose money/her over someone you say you love, but you don't throw love and 2 years away for money.. if you really loved me, this idea never would have crossed your mind.. he swears up and down that he does love me.. I take off the bracelet he gave me last Christmas and set it on the table next to his key and USMC ring and dog tags - I stop talking and eventually leave.

That's it Reddit.. my heart is in pieces. I haven't heard from him today

Thanks to all who gave me advice.. and I'm sorry I don't have a happy ending for you. Your kind words and support gave me the strength I needed to do what I knew I had to.. I just wish he never put me in the position to have to do it.

Great guy
When we first hooked up he was working out everyday and well on his way to reaching a healthy weight.  He was beginning to look as fantastic as he is.  A year later

Worst part:  I am having crazy difficulties looking at him when we make sexy time.  Doggy-style or me on top with my face smashed into his pillow over his shoulder pretty much rule the roost right now.

Can't thank you ladies and gents enough for talking me through this complicated situation.

She was playing pool by herself and I went up and asked her if she wanted to play.  We had a great time and I asked if I could see her again.  She told me from the start we could hang out but she wasn't looking for any kind of relationship.  We met at the same bar for awhile and got to know each other.  She always made it clear she thought  I was great but just wasn't in the mind set for a man.

She was never flirtacious with anyone, was an amazing artist, played golf...She literally does EVERYTHING I do! 

I haven't been pushy to get her to myself but every once in awhile I'd drop a joke or a hint about how I wanted her to be mine alone.  That I thought she was beautiful

Anyhow...Now you know why I have been head over heels for the last 9 months.  The other day I ask her if she wants to meet up for lunch.  I decide I can't help but wonder why she doesn't want to be with ANYONE

Finally she gives it to me.  It all makes sense now. She tells me the reason she can't be with me is that she has herpes.  She tells me everything and its not even her fault.  Her boyfriend cheated on her and gave it to her.  She hadn't been with anyone not even a one night stand in almost 2 years.  Its made her feel ugly and diseased.  She said she couldn't just not tell someone so she chooses to remain alone.

I wanted to cry.  I wanted to hug her and tell her how sorry I was and how she is still an amazing person.  The only words that come out of my mouth though are

But now I feel like I can't be with her

TL'DR  I meet the perfect girl whose been my friend for the last 9 months

EDIT:  I just texted her and told her ""I'm sorry being kind of cold the other day. It was just a real shocker, ""I didn't know how you'd react, it could have been worse. Lets go to Vincent's""  (Dirt track) We're gonna go ride bikes in about an hour here.  I think I will continue being her friend and I think I might just talk to her and maybe a doctor about the safest way around all of this.

I told my parents about this last night as she has their email and home phone and said I don't want them communicating with her. They understood completely. I stopped in a few minutes ago and they said they received a long email from her

She also called and left a message (I left my parents her # so they know not to pick up) and it was nonchalant about what she should do about a family event that is coming up in a few weeks

I then got 2 more calls around the same time from two numbers I didn't recognize. I didn't answer either. Neither left a message. That was the last contact attempt she made (probably 6:30ish

Original post TLDR; I cheated and got caught

First let me say thank you to everyone who commented. I read all of them and they helped me more than I can ever say. Thank you

What a difference a week makes. I came to reddit a mere 5 days ago

After reading all the comments last week, not my warden. She took it pretty well, and seemed to understand where I was coming from and recognized the huge amount of work ive put into myself and this relationship. It felt like a fairly major breakthrough. We even discussed picking a new therapist and giving that another try. 

But there was something nagging me the whole time. A redditor said to me that he went through something similar

After a couple days

Friday comes and I am excited to see my buddies. We talked a little before I left, answered txts and phone class in a timely fashion and got home 20 min before I said I would as a show of good faith. My wife is in bed already but sleepily asks how the night went and I said it was great. 

Saturday morning we discuss it at length. She seems genuinely happy and understanding, I decide that trust is not made with a key logger. It was dumb to install it, and will only create paranoia in me. I should also mention that while she has full access to my email, I have the same access to her email and facebook. So really it seemed that a key logger was overkill. I go to uninstall it.

Of course curiosity gets the best of me and I check the very limited 2.5 days worth of logs. Nothing jumps out at me; amazon, gmail, etc. I get to the end of the log and it's looking good. Until I see another trip to gmail, this time for an account I have never seen before. I remain calm, I keep an old hotmail account for spam/sign-up crap. I've advised her to do the same and only let friends know her real email. 

Either way

Now this folder is full. Full as in hundreds of emails. However none of it is tax related. All of it is to or from ""Steve"". I have a 65yo  step-uncle named Steve

I made a new gmail account, I pay closer attention to the dates. This affair has been going on for a very long time. All the way back to roughly a year before my son was born. (or 1.5 years before I cheated). That hits me like a ton of bricks. What if my son isn't mine? What if my 1yr old baby girl isn't mine? I fucking lose it. I verify my tracks are covered and bolt out of the house saying I'm going to the gym. I sit in my car for 2 hours crying at the thought they might not be mine and how do I ever move forward. I have no idea how to confront her. 

I head home and find her best friend is there. They have decided they want to go a movie. Im still in shock, repeatedly. No answer. I call about 10 times, no answer. 

It's 1am and I'm sitting on the couch and she walks in. Surprised to see me up, cant talk in a movie. And then she forgot to check it when she headed to the 'bar' for one drink. She makes her way to the stairs and I say ""How is Steve doing?"". Her face goes white. ""Uh, your uncle Steve?"" she says. ""No, the Steve you just got done fucking 20 minutes ago. How is he?"" I say. She says nothing. I tell her I found the gmail account. I saw her email planning to met him after the movie tonight. With what little composure I had left, I asked ""Why didn't you come clean when you found about me cheating? We could have fixed this together."". She starts bawling and runs upstairs. 

I follow. What ensues is the worst 4 hours of my life. She comes clean that she met him back when she was working, while not right, I cheated because we didnt have sex. But obviously she was having sex elsewhere, so she didnt need it at home. So I asked why she cheated, because I know prior to ""Steve"" we had sex 2-3 times a week, and she came 1-2 times each time. She says he was relentless in pursuing her which made her feel sexy, and that the relationship was taboo, but liked the thrill and the taboo.  I could go on and on, without a blood test

I stand up, and that I need to go for a walk. 

I walk for an hour and come home and crash on the couch. Sunday was beyond ackward, Id be struck by the fact that I dont know what Steve looks like. Perhaps he has big ears too, and that's where my son gets them. 

We talked briefly Sunday night. Despite wanting to ask more and understand more

It felt good to get that out. Im not sure what to do from here. Part of me thinks that neither of us will likely ever trust the other. But the other part thinks that she could have left 2 years ago to either be alone or be with Steve. She gave me another chance

UPDATE: I got home from work and she had the kids at her parents for a sleep over. She kept trying to get me to say what I thought or felt

She did eventually get me to talk. I basically said that I don't know what to do, perhaps Im not the person she loves but instead loves the idea of ""us"". She saw my point and said she did love me but understood that some time apart might help. ",,False,,t5_2r0cn,True,,

By contrast, a guy who lays 50 women in 3 months is a ""pimp"", because he is doing something challenging.  A woman who has sex with 50 men in 3 months isn't necessarily more sexually appealing, just more willing to have sex.

Now, etc.

This is bullshit.  Some evolutionary psychology is helpful here: men want to impregnate as many women as possible.  This mentality is evolutionarily desirable and thus has been selected for over millions of years, she must be picky.  After all, if she mates with just any old man, her offspring will be less likely to survive, and her genes will be less likely to be passed on.  Thus, she picks the most fit male to mate with.

Let me repeat: **For men

But to top it off, her pregnancy might not be *his* offspring.  When he invests resources into feeding the child, he'd better be sure it's his.  Second, if a woman is having sex indiscriminately, her female children will also be more likely to have sex indiscriminately, which will ultimately negatively affect his own genes' survival.

It gets even worse though!  If one woman is having sex with all the men

**TL;DR: Men have evolved to be promiscuous.  Women have evolved to be selective.  Men have evolved to prefer women who are selective.  Women have evolved to dislike women who are promiscuous.**

*Note - I am attaching no moral judgment to any of this.  I have no problem with men who are chaste or women who are promiscuous.   These are just the very deep-seated reasons why our biology compels us to think of men as pimps and women as sluts.*


**UPDATE:** I feel somewhat compelled to defend my points

**Criticism 1:** *We're not animals

**Criticism 2:** *Promiscuity isn't controlled by biology*  Why would it not be?  At the risk of appearing to fall on the wrong side of the nature/nurture divide, over the course of evolution, promiscuity levels, like every.other.trait in human beings, was selected for in some way or another.  It's common knowledge that on a species level, the size of the male's junk is directly related to promiscuity.

**Criticism 3:**  *Women who are promiscuous are likely to produce promiscuous male offspring too, again, not a great leap.

**Criticism 4:** *Women can't have evolved to dislike women who are promiscuous, but the basic idea is that females who prohibit other females from becoming too promiscuous are more likely to survive.  Anyways, people have biologically-based impulses that result in value judgments all the time.  This berry tastes weird (it's poisoned), this milk smells bad (it's gone sour), this man is creepy (he's likely a rapist), the dark alley scares me (i'm unable to defend myself).  It's in no way a stretch to think that women could develop an aversion to women who were monopolizing male sexual attention.

**The Big One: Criticism 5:** *Evolutionary psychology is bullshit*.  

Maybe.  But I submit that if you believe that thought and behavior has a biological basis (certainly the brain itself ought to convince you...) and you believe in evolution (not a great leap on Reddit)

Here's a question.  Have you seen the process of the evolution of the human eye?  Of course not.  We haven't found the intermediate steps in the puzzle.  But because we have the evolutionary framework, rather than the actual genes, because in almost all cases of macroevolution, *we have to do that*.  I have no idea whether cavemen millions of years ago were promiscuous or not, just as you have no idea what particular shape the eye took when it was first developed.  In fact, the best Richard Dawkins can do is point to the possible ways that the eye evolved and the *evolutionary pressures* that caused that evolution.",,,,

I'll try to make this as short as possible. I'm a 34 year old guy who has never had sex. My problem is a total lack of confidence due to a reason I deem so grotesque I feel I should warn people to not read on if they have weak stomachs. Basically I suffer from what is known as nodular acne or cystic acne, and all over your entire body (even genitals and ass sometimes). I've tried every treatment all the way up to Accutane which is this super harsh medication with horrible side effects. I've tried 3 rounds of Accutane over the last 15 years but it returns quickly and with a vengeance (my last round I had to stop within a month because the side effects were so bad). I've been to more dermatologists than you could imagine and the consensus is there truly is no cure for this. It's like a kind of modern day leprosy.

I've seen a lot of wacky stuff on the internet but I assure you I've never seen someone who looks as gruesome as I do naked. I completely understand why girls want nothing to do with me just based on what they can see (acne on my neck, the new acne would just ruin my skin all over again.

I've never had a girlfriend, sometimes I'll go days or even weeks where I feel so horny that I can't focus on anything, masturbation doesn't really solve much anymore, and even if I could have sex right now I'd be so disgusted at having my body be seen I'd find the situation a total turnoff, and the idea of a prostitute doesn't appeal to me one bit. To be honest I want love/relationship more than sex. Seeing all these happy couples enjoying their lives just kills me with jealousy and self pity.

To give a little more background info on myself: I'm self-employed (and fortunately I do rather well for myself), smoking herb and windsurfing... fairly ""normal"" on that front, I suppose, but I feel so infantile and embarrassed about being a virgin that I have no confidence, I'm super shy around any girl and it feels like each of these problems exacerbates the next problem, etc.

What should I do? Every single girl I see is so hot to me and I'm out of my mind craving girls but if I smile at one they either turn away instantly or give me a look that reduces me to nothing. This is really embarrassing to post but I'm just going to post it and hope for some helpful advice - I need it because I'm losing my effing mind and it's really hard to describe how sad I feel over all this.

She was actually very nice about it, though we were both clearly uncomfortable. We spoke for maybe 3 minutes in the middle of a crowded mall and it felt like it was *hours*. She did most of the talking, by asking me out for coffee after the holidays. That was today.

It's interesting to see how people change and how we all cope with that change. Some of us manage better and seek catharsis by re-evaluating, really.

Okay, me mostly because of all the hormones and sleep deprivation, and for him I think it's more the fact that we haven't had sex since the baby yet.

I have been waiting to feel all in love and sexy again, but I just can't stop it. I hate it. I have the best husband, he takes care of me and the baby and gives me everything I want. He's been able to take my mood swings for now, but I'm afraid it won't last forever.

So here's my plan that I thought of today: I'm gonna ""fake it till I make it"". Try and start acting like I was when we first fell in love. Hug and kiss him spontaneously, tell him I love him, etc. I think this will stop the gap between us from growing, and I will actually start feeling better and won't lose this wonderful relationship in the meantime.

Any suggestions to what else I can do? Or what do you think about this plan in general? Any perspective will be helpful and kindly appreciated.

People, but they had their own lives and concerns to deal with. My initial attempts at rebuilding a social life floundered and failed.

I'm despairing. True love and faithful relationships don't exist. The people who stay together are fucking miserable, manipulative, mean, and in return are easily manipulated and seduced.

Been together over a year.


I'm leaving him. I went to see a free crisis therapist and they helped me call him to tell him what was going on. I'm getting a restraining order
hopefully... But I'm not pressing charged.


He was sorry and said he under stood and he'd leave to his parents in a few hours and stay there. I got a police escort home when he said he left


This is hard and heartbreaking for me...


Also, I didn't. I really did only toss them and he even admitted that after he hit my head into the wall that he realized how insignificant my act had been. It wasn't aimed at him, the fish, or the wall and it wasn't hard.


I do get out of the house every day without him and go on walks. I love my alone time redditing and such and want to make friends. I don't follow him around all day, just not all the time.


The argument was that he did tell me positives, so what does he really think? No, I wasn't calm or collected, yes I did cry and not accept the good he said. Yeah, I am part of the reason we had the argument, but I didn't do anything that deserved my head put into a wall and a fucked up face...


TL;DR Boyfriend's gone. Thanks guys for all the help.

I went through a very normal adolescence.  But my parents could not handle this.  I liked boys -- nice, kind, boys.  The kind of boys you would WANT your daughter to date because they are so respectful of her.  As I began sneaking around with my first boyfriend, teachers, other parents, and my friends encouraged me to just tell my parents and stop sneaking around!   After all, the relationship was SO innocent (we had barely kissed) and so very age appropriate.  So took their well meaning advice.

That night, I learned that the well meaning advice of others is not always correct.  My parents freaked the fuck out.  They got me tested for STD's (I had not, as yet, had sex, though I did end up fucking a couple years later). They also called the police.  It began four years of terror.

I developed Anorexia

I could go on

They pulled me out of therapy for my anorexia because, she liked me and that just wasn't right to them. *This stuff is just the tip of the iceberg.*

Here is a good summary of how I spent my teenage years.  I am the oldest of 5.  4 girls, crying.  And she screamed to my siblings in the back, ""KIDS.  Promise me you won't be like Jessica.""  There was silence.  ""Say it!"" she yelled again.  And from the back came 4, quiet little voices mumbling, ""I won't be like Jessica.""

Like I said

When the phone rings and it's them

**My family doctor is also a psychologist.  I have been in therapy with him and he is great.   He believes it is time for me to write my parents an email and ask them to acknowledge the abuse.  If they refuse

I realize this will hurt them.  But that is not my PURPOSE.  I no longer feel anger and I no longer actively wish harm on them.  Quite the opposite.  With therapy, and not visiting for years at a stretch with no explanation.**

I would like a relationship with them that is somewhat honest.  I need to be myself

**Has anyone else done this?  PLEASE give advice.**

All he cared about was fucking strangers and smoking weed. I told my parents

Then one day he came back to my hometown and looked like he was on death's door, and spend the week I wanted to use to introduce my girl to my parents hand-wringing over my brother. When I visited him, all he could talk about was how it sucked that he couldn't have sex anymore with random strangers and how smoking weed was great for the physical pain. Again, no comprehension of how much he has hurt the people who love him or regret at not listening to us when we told him he was acting like a psychotic teenage manchild (couched in nicer terms, of course). And now my parents have to take care of him for the rest of his life because he's unable to do it on his own, and his HIV treatments (paid for by my mother) cost so much money my family is going into debt.

All I can do is feel absolutely disgusted and angry at him. My parents are good people and raised him well, although in high school he dated a heroin addicted emotionally abusive guy. He is completely self-centered and unaware of the damage he has caused himself and the people who care about him by acting so irresponsibly. But I can't fucking say it to anyone because when a family member has a chronic/terminal disease, you're supposed to be lovey and supportive because they will be gone. I don't feel like being lovey and supportive. I actually hate him, because my family is breaking apart over this and my dad is close to suicidal, and I want to know if you think I'm overreacting.

Of course, it's not possible to talk to them without talking about him. And it makes me rage inside.

**edit: Thank you everyone for your kind words and advice. **I will definitely be talking to him in the next few weeks, really fucking angry at him and his callous stupid behavior. But I can moderate that and try to have a constructive conversation. I will also be looking into alternate avenues for antiretrovirals with my parents so that he is not such a drain, and suggest that they might test him for meth or have the hospital do so next time he is there (which is a lot lately.) For now, though, I need to stop talking about it on reddit and focus my mind elsewhere.

Seriously guys, here's a reminder.

* Shower daily. Yes daily
* Brush, if you want your women to make the effort to look good, you gotta look good yourself and the long haired hippy look? Yeah does not look good. (On the opposite scale, buzz cuts-- no. Just no. Unless you are in the army, don't do it.) (Oh, btw, best place to get a haircut? Not in your bathroom with a pair of scissors or a rusty razor,at the hairdressers. Don't worry, to choose a style that will look good on you. And trust their advice)*
* Deodorant
* DO NOT wear the same clothes everyday
* And along the same lines, you don't have to wear it all the time, but if you wanna pick up, you wanna look good.

We have been a couple for almost 6 months

This is the first serious relationship, she is my first.

My girlfriend has always been a bit insecure about her body (she used to be overweight a few years ago

We've been having sex for the past 3 months now (we used to have a problem at first

I thought this had something to do with her insecurity

She would also often ""refuse"" sex, but always in a giggling way so I rarely took it serious, thinking she was just being playful. If I did stop completely, she would sometimes go back to heavily making out, or going down on me. So I honestly have no idea what to think.

A few hours ago though

That already made me feel a bit weird. So she got up and sat down at the end of my bed. I got up next to her and asked her what's wrong and she basically told me I sometimes have to accept no as an answer.

She made it sound like every time she told me no (which quite frankly, and not in the playful way like I thought.

I honestly feel very sad/disgusted with my self right now. I can't stop thinking how every single time we have had sex right now, I am honestly too ""scared"" right now.

I don't really know what advice you can give to me

I’m posting this in light of the events that have transpired over the past four weeks of my life. Little about me – I’m a guy, living in a pretty big city. I was in a 2.75 year relationship leaving high school, and nothing going on. I made no friends. After not even a full month of living up here

Fast forward to about 5 weeks ago. I was sitting at a bar (120 beers on tap, and entirely too shy to go up to her and say anything. My friend and I finish our meal and get ready to head out. That girl whom I’ve been playing eye-chase with all night just so happened to be leaving too. We walk out of the bar and stand on the corner to cross the street. That girl and her friend leave too, and walk right behind us crossing the street the other way. Me, still too nervous to look. We cross the street, and as soon as we do I get the feeling to look behind for her. Sure enough, I caught her doing the exact same thing. I tell my friend about it, and tell him about how badly I wanted to go talk to her. He jokingly told me to go do it, and we drive towards them. After a little more debate I jump out of the car and sprint towards them. A thousand different things are running through my mind as I'm jogging towards them. 5 feet behind them my mind went completely blank. I had absolutely NO idea what I was supposed to say. What the fuck was I doing? I startled them at first. I looked at her and asked her name, just as I did to my friend. I didn’t get her number. We departed with a laugh and “it was nice looking at you?” Holy shit

The next Sunday I managed to talk my friend into going to the same place, locking eyes with her every so often. Too nervous to go up to her, we left. My friends crossed the street and I stopped dead in my tracks and said to myself “no. fuck this. I didn’t pass this up the first time and I’m sure as hell not going to pass it up again.” I told them I’d be there in a second. I went back into the bar, and motioned her away from her friends. I gave her my phone number this time, and she blushed. She textd me a few minutes later. Holy shit, that worked?  We’ve been in contact constantly since. Either texting, calling

We meet up at the same bar a week later and talked for six straight hours. I felt like she was in to me. I met one of the most funny, beautiful girls I’ve ever met. We met up again a few days after, and kissed. This girl was great. She was 28, moved here 4 years ago from a very large South American country, and is training to work in the airline industry. She loves animals, loves good beer, and has a tiny scar on her eyebrow from riding a tricycle into a wall when she was a little girl. Shit, and the only reason she is in this city is for the job training. Our time was limited. Whenever we hung out we would sneak away from our friends to go kiss. Yesterday at the park I had her show me where the bathroom was so I could pull her into some trees to kiss her. She pulled me into an alley after lagging behind our friends while bar hopping just to sneak in a kiss. Whenever we get together we can just talk for hours on end. I haven't met anyone in over a year and a half that when they talked

Last night was the last night I think I’ll ever see her again. We spent 3 hours talking in my car until 4am after a night out with friends. (she had to be up at 6 too, that she really liked me. Her training is done, so it is finals week this coming up week and she is flying home on Friday. No time to hang out. Bear in mind that if there is any chance, we will see each other again.

This is the first girl I’ve been even remotely interested in

I'm sorry

I have been dating the woman I thought was perfect for me since last Nov. But things haven't gone all that smoothly and I have asked you guys for advice once before, and things looked up for us.

So last night, and another friend of her's shows up, a gorgeous woman we both find attractive, and know she is attracted to both of us, even though she claims to be a lesbian. The four of us hung out, and enjoyed ourselves for another hour or two, when our friends both decided to head out.

After a short time, just the gf and I relaxing on a nice weekend. Surprisingly, the beautiful lesbian friend arrives, and we get a few more rounds, chatting and playing pool and games. Later in the night, while we are playing games, I notice the friend becoming touchy and trying to kiss the gf. So when we get a second free, and will never tell her what she can and cannot do. The friend lets me know she has been trying to kiss my gf

I leave them alone, my gf finally calls for me, and I walk over and tell the gf she can do whatever she likes. Happily, she starts to enjoy her friend, and they kiss, dance, and fool around in the empty bar. 

The gf and I have discussed our sexual relationship many times, and has told me she is done with doing anything crazy like that anymore.

So the gf and her friend really start to get things going in the bar, as the kissed and groped. She grabbed her and they ran off to the bathroom, and I quickly followed. We locked the door, and they kissed for a bit. My gf tells her she doesn't want to leave me out, and the friend better be ok with that, and the friend kisses me deeply. So I'm cool. My gf pulls my dick out, and shows her, and the slight curve hits perfect. The 'lesbian' agrees, and I tell the gf to head out of the bathroom first, the gf punches me in the chest

At home get in the house, and they start making out. Gf tosses her on the counter, and grinds against her, pulling her clothes off. Of course I join in, and when we are all finally naked, we stop, and head to the bed.

They start making out, and I lay with them, helping. We all get a taste of the girls, a little at a time, and the friend lays back, as the gf gets on her hands and knees and eats her out. So, being the good bf, having sex with her while she eats her friend. She enjoys this for a good bit, not touching her yet at all, and she winds back and hits me again

A few minutes later, and come back in the house. The gf apologizes, and tells me to come lay in bed. I go to the couch and lay down, and she gets me to come to bed. I can only lay there for a few minutes, and I get up, and lay back down on the couch.

This morning she got up when I did for work, mad. She apologized, and tried to talk, but I couldn't.

I've gotten over a lot of what happened, and attractive. I try to fool around at times and be a little exciting, but she always shrugs me off, especially in public. I never get the type of attention or desire she showed last night, and I don't think I ever will from her.

She sent me a text this morning on my way to work, and she loved me so much. I told her I just wanted a bit of the passion she gave her friend, and I have been begging for it for a while now.

So, because of the way she made love to the woman, and how much she put in to it. I wish she would make love to me even close to that, with half the passion and want for the partner. I have told her on a couple of occasions, but I guess she doesn't have it for me. What do you guys think? I really could use some help.

**Update**: Thanks for all the comments, want me to leave. Still don't know what I'm going to do, but I'm siding with Redditors. Plus, I found out I'm being abused, many ways, and I'm sexist. Awesome.

Friend: It's all good. You two going to be alright?

OP: What would you have done?

Friend: What do you mean? What would I have done?

OP: Yea. Sorry, I will never see. She never lusts after me or desires me like that. Sorry to have brought this drama to your life.

Friend: It's ok. I've had my share of lond term relationships

OP: Well, there will be no sex between us. So you will have a chance for alone time with her.

Friend: That's not what I want. I just wanted to have fun with you both last night. I don't have that kind of connection with her. Furthermore, she turned away because she thought I was going to kiss her and she didn't want that she just wanted you and not to share you.

OP: I'm sorry, and she pushes me away. I can't get her to even touch me in the bar, let alone dry hump and make out in the bathroom like last night.

OP: And I don't know what she told you

Friend: Didn't think about that. I'm sorry

A day or so after I posted, I tried to initiate a talk about it with my girlfriend, and she shut down completely.

In late Janurary we began messaging and texting on a daily basis.  I was a little reluctant at first because I had ended my engagement with my bf of 7 years in October and I was still a little nervous about seeing anyone. 

I fell for J right away, my friends, his family?  In a matter of weeks I lost 12 lbs and I was completely head over heels for J.  He was the polar opposite of my fiance, tall, charming, talkative, and confident.  

We went to dinner for our first date and I was very timid and nervous, naturally I wasn't ready for a new relationship.  

Valentine's Day came along and I was pleasantly surprised when he asked to take me on a second date

In a span of several weeks we went on two more dates, that's all it became.  He would text me everyday with pics of himself, his friends, dinner, or whatever it was he was doing.  Again, I told myself he's just a bachelor and he's having fun.  He'd make plans with me for real dates then he'd bail or cancel.  Yet, I convinced myself that since he looked for me everyday, if sex was the only way I'd get to see him I continued to stick around.  I did make it clear to him that since he didn’t want to take it further with me
It’s now been 5 months of this and last week I finally mustered up the courage to cut it off.  It hurt that he was totally ok with it, he shared a link and he had a comment that said “I love you!” from a girl I’d previously questioned him about and he’d said she was nobody, just a friend.  I was determined to find out once and for all if he just didn’t like me, or if there was someone else all along.  I found her instagram and it was there that I saw it all .  Even though I suspected it, I was still lied to and it hurt like hell.  He’s been with her for 10 months, and seeing me for 5, she’s so in love with him it makes me sick.  

Obviously

TL;DR: I was someone’s f buddy for 5 months

I'm sitting here staring at the long email I typed out for her.  Last night he had the audacity to text me at 2 am, he respected that and that I should do the same.  He said he's sorry for what he did, and that she's not his gf and I don't understand their relationship, for me to stay out of it.  I know for a fact that they are not in an open relationship, and the comments and pictures on her instagram say it all.  I'm 26 and I'm an elementary teacher, I have a decent reputation and my biggest mistake has been this idiot.  I feel she should know he's a cheater but I'm truly embarrassed to be caught up in this.

For well over a year and half

There were sparks and romance and adoration and entirely too much clingyness from each of us. And it never, but we still give each other butterflies and it's been over two years now.

This is not to say that everything was perfect. We hurt each other quite badly at times. But whatever happened, and by committing to staying together and becoming even stronger.

Nobody else I've ever met holds a candle to her. I'm crazy in love with her

But we may have come across a Kobayashi Maru -- a no-win scenario.

She's bisexual, mutually fantasizing over girls let us have MORE fun, haha.

But it's that bisexuality that's keeping her from totally understanding where I'm coming from lately

Back in November, and judge the community's reaction to similar circumstances in both roles.

What she found was that in the male persona, she kept seeing relatable patterns in her own life.

Eventually, a man in a woman's body.

Thus the no-win scenario for us. I'm undeniably straight. And if I wasn't so close and so in love with this person

Alas

Every time he talks about getting testosterone, we've reached a point where what makes him happy makes me incredibly uncomfortable, and vice-versa. Even just referring to him AS a him hurts.

Nothing's changed physically yet, ""Why did it have to be you? Why did you have to see me as I am as being so perfect and so wonderful?"" And she's right. She was absolutely perfect for me.

But this is not something either of us can change. As Lady Gaga said, but I don't know what to do.

tl;dr: My girlfriend of over two years has realized that s/he's a man in a woman's body. I am attracted only to women.

EDIT: My partner made a comment in response to a lot of what we're seeing. A lot of people quite fairly figured this was just a case of her seeing how she might be treated as a man, it might make for a reasonable conclusion. I'll post the comment here for visibility:

""Okay

I've had gender issues since long before I did that project. I had been wrestling with things for years and I didn't have the resources to understand a lot of it. I had been a guy online for years prior because of what I thought was a easier social environment. Being a guy was nothing new. I have never been ""girly"" by nature. I used to pass a boy when I was little, wore makeup, high heels, tried to talk the way they do, but I was never happy. Relationships were weird, people always reacted to me in ways I couldn't understand, and in the end I said fuck it. For years now I've been the tomboyish Rainbow Dash type of person I felt I was since I was a child. I have always preferred women sexually to men

When I met my current partner I was lucky as fuck. This man is as nerdy as I am. He gets me. He didn't ask me to be more feminine, or that I curse like a bloody sailor. I have never been happier.

After I started the social experiment online, things I had not wanted to face for years out of fear of losing the life I had built for myself. I freaked out. I fought the urge to run away and started doing research on gender identity. I felt instantly that I was like a man in a woman's body, but I was terrified to say it. I identified as gender queer for a few months. I tried to reach out to other people, sought counseling. I couldn't find anyone in my area to help me. One of my old friends reached out to me after seeing my posts. He was now becoming a she and wanted to give me some advice. I found her words to be more than helpful. After that I knew the only reason I was trying to say I was gender queer was because I was afraid of losing my lover. That wasn't healthy for me. I am not going to go jumping into this like an idiot. I'm still researching and I'm still trying to find an appropriate therapist. The surgeries I need are expensive, and I am broke. I'm going to have to spend years earning the money I need, on top of trying to finish college and make find a place to live. This isn't a whim I got on, or some fun social game for me to do like a teenager trying to escape into a new identity. This is serious shit people. I'm aware of that. 

Trust me.

I love my partner, but at the same time, he has surprised me many times. I am not going to expect anything. I am going to go through what I have to and hope he comes along with me. It's asking a lot, but I wouldn't ask if I didn't think he was worth it.""",,False,,1369443357.0,t3_1eym15

It eventually became a must, and we would have a threesome with another guy, then later with another girl, just to be equal. I had never had any experience with another guy prior, I suspect she had some same-sex experience prior, the idea of having sex with her hot friend and her outweighed the potential horror of doing another dude. We figured it wasn't cheating if we went together and I was a good sport about it.

At this point, but I seemed to notice a change between us and in our mutual friends. I began to wonder about her.

I come to ask for relationship advice


Let me tell you something about myself. I'm 33 this year and my life so far has been uneventful and unremarkable. I go to work every day. I come home at night. I pay my bills. I have two great parents and two great siblings and we all get together every weekend. Both my siblings are married and with kids. I love my nephews and nieces and hope to find someone special to start a family with sometime soon. 


Oh


I remember this girl I dated back in College. She was so pretty and so beautiful. We were *perfect* together. She loved me and I loved her and we made such plans like only lovestruck college kids can. But like most college kids


Her mother contacted me last week. 


Skin cancer is a horrible


A week ago


No


I don't know how to be a father. I didn't even know I was a father. In my heart, thinking about how to proceed. For now, we've agreed that it would be wrong to subject her to any further stress by putting her in an unfamiliar and frightening situation: she's staying right where she is, with her maternal grandparents. And I've not worked up the courage or even the right words to tell her who I am. How does one even explain this to a bright 8 year old? Will she hate me? Her Mother? I don't know what to do and I feel so alone. I *want* to tell my parents, but I don't know what they'll think of me. I want to ask my brother for help. Mostly, I just want to cry. I feel so helpless.   

How do I even begin to forge a relationship with a daughter I've never met?
--------------------------------------
**EDIT:** Sorry folks. I posted this pretty late at night and sleep got the best of me. I want to thank you all for your words of wisdom and support. 

I understand that there are many things I need to do and put in order before I dive headfirst into this. I need to settle the question of Paternity of this child without a shadow of a doubt if I intend to be a father to her and to seek custody in the future. But I will proceed under the assumption that she is my daughter as at the moment I don't have any reason to doubt my exgirlfriend's word or just the logistics around this (the dates match). I have made plans to meet once more with the grandparents at the cemetery this morning (Saturday here) and I will ask them afterwards if they consent to a Paternity test to make things legal (they in fact suggested something similar earlier - I didn't think much about this then


After that


And for those of you who have suggested I seek professional help. That I **will** do early next week. I will find out what my rights are in this situation and what I need to do to exercise those rights if it comes to it. I need to come to terms with my shellshock and grief ASAP

They say paternity tests take 4 to 6 weeks. That's a long time to ponder 'what if'. I will let you all know how this goes. Thanks.

    And to those who think it was silly to rely on the Reddit Hivemind: I agree with you mostly
    great benefit in drawing in the advice of well-intentioned and wise people and parents who can help me
    with their experiences and encouragement. Sometimes

The next morning we had picked up the conversation and were talking it all out when her mother told her the good news: The nice man at the tent place was kind enough to give her deposit back in full! annnnnnd thats how she broke the news to my Fiancée  that the wedding was cancelled and she had gotten all of her deposits back from the band, etc. 

She said she did it because my Fiancée had doubts. Doubts which I feel were planted by the mother and aunt who have been telling my Fiancée for the last 6 months that I wasn't good enough and that she doesn't love me as much as an EX from 7 years ago. 

Now, or being walked down the aisle. We have had to contact the 200 some odd people that were coming to our wedding and tell them its cancelled and she is still not sure that she loves me the 100% that she thinks she should. 

All of this has happened while I have been out of town on a business trip and I don't return for a week. When I get home she wants to discuss what we should do in person i.e. do we want to get married? do we want to stay together? What are we going to do?

Intriguing choice of terminology. I guess fending off unwanted advances is a bit bitchy

&gt; *DDB:* ""Doggy Dinner Bowl"" [Look] - The look on a chick's face when she's tranced out or lapping up your words with a phased out look in their eyes. In that state

Welp

&gt; *VC:* 	Victim Chick. A chick which comes with a lot of emotional baggage (possibly of past abuse) who gives guys the opportunity to be a rescuer, you'll hear this type of girl say ""I've never told anyone this..."" when talking about her messed up past.

Indeed

I could go on if you'd like.

**e3:** How could i have forgotten kino? Ah

*Kino:* Kinesthetic approach (physical touching). Usually of a sexual nature, stroking her hair, cheeks, stroking her hand or wrist, etc

1286496431.0,dobeg,"Married, very unhappy, and maintaining a facade that I can't keep up forever.",desparado,160,78, it’s a long post.** No

Backstory:
I’m married, both working, own a condo, two cars, have a pretty close earning level. No kids, though we’ve talked about them around our 30s. On paper, everything’s fine.

I don’t know if she thinks everything is fine – she might! - but certainly we both do a good job pretending that it is. I know I pretend that everything’s fine

Why would I want out?

Well, whether our schedules line up, whether we’re in a good mood, etc. But, be that as it may, it has translated to me having sex perhaps once every two months at best.

I’ll admit that I don’t really ask for it anymore, but since we’ve been living together it’s been pretty bland, unless I put a lot of effort into it… mostly, she just lies there. I enjoy performing oral, which she seems to appreciate, but rarely if ever have I received it in return.

She’s a good-looking girl, and is sometimes lax about her hygiene. She has no interest in exercising whatsoever and instead coasts on her fast metabolism, which is slowing over the years – it’s not a sustainable way to keep her appearance, and I worry that without a change in the next few years, she’ll never manage to be in good shape. 

I don’t think my lack of desire for her is necessarily connected to how she looks, if she wanted to, but it doesn’t happen. So I’ve given up on that front.

To add to this, and I’ve listened to her rants when she comes home. Ultimately, though, they end up being about the same sort of issues over and over again, and there comes a point when I can no longer try to make her feel better about them when it’s clear they’re not going anywhere. Instead, her stress just makes me stressed, and we end up feeding back on each other

Now
I’ve even commented before that we’re always arguing about petty things, these arguments most often happen late at night when I’m tired. I virtually always capitulate because I know she’ll stay in the fight longer than I will and that it’s better for me to just end it early by losing as gracefully as I can. Of course, when you lose to get out of a fight, it’s not like you’ve actually given up your opinions – you’ve just apologized your way out of the situation. The problem remains.

On another note, and she let a lot of them go through lack of maintenance of the relationship. She does still have a core group of girls, but they get together once every two months, max. She gets along with my core group of friends well, and their girlfriends, but never calls them to hang out.

Why is this important? Well, and then sit on the computer all night “unwinding”. At least she’s not playing an MMO or anything, mostly just reading forums, but it results in a life that’s got to be ridiculously monotonous and stressful. 

My suggestions to find things to do (Take yoga! Go swimming! Paint a picture! Walk! Bike! Run! Hike! Go to our free condo gym! Call your friends and hang out!) are always met with criticism or “meh”. I’m willing to have us shell out whatever money it takes for her to find an interesting activity to do
 
I go hang out with friends, which has increased as of late. But the vast majority is because she either doesn’t want to go along, or if I bring her I will have to babysit her all night and I won’t have any fun.

For example, that meant that instead of me dancing and having fun, we sat at a table in the corner of the club all night, not really drinking, not really talking, mostly just moping with nothing to do. Few things are more depressing to me than being a wallflower for no reason. 

I think that I’m a good husband, I stay in shape, I’m nice to her and compliment her, I tell her that I love her. Every morning, I make her breakfast and help her get her things in order, and when I get home I tidy up any mess from the morning before she gets home. I do all of the ‘hard’ chores, all of the “man’s work”, and all my own laundry. Yet

I don’t know how much longer I can deal with this and keep putting on a façade that Everything’s Okay before I crack and make a mess of it all.

I just keep feeling that I’m in the prime of my life – I look good, and I have a ton of friends – including single women. I have decent earning power and skills, and I love talking to people… couldn’t I probably find someone that I’d actually be happy with? Someone who I’d look forward to coming home to? 

And if that’s true, smart, sexy women that are still single in my age range drops every year. If I wait until I’m 35 and have two kids to do this, it’ll be the biggest mistake of my life. I don’t know if I can do sixty-odd years of this when it feels pretty damn rough already.

Yeah, as far as I know, she doesn’t know I feel this way. How the fuck do I even explain any of this without putting her massively on the defensive? How can I deal with the emotions she’d feel if I told her any of this? I still love her, but I don’t know if I want to be with her.

Things were going fine until the last 6 months of last year, no kissing, no time alone, no sex.  She says I should always be able to trust her and that she ""NEVER cheated on me"".  She convinced me she was a good person, being respectable enough to break up with me BEFORE she cheated (sex) with this guy.  She apologized a lot and acted really sorry she was dumping me this way.

She complimented me saying I was really good in bed

Even though she was dumping me, she hopes we can stay friends but she is dumping me for this guy.  7 Years down the drain overnight, with no warning.  That was fucking brutal and I'm still devastated by it.  She reiterated how she ""NEVER cheated on me"".  There was a lot of talking during the breakup and a lot of deep confessions and things came out between us, but nothing seriously bad.  She did admit to lying the final weeks about where she was, to hide the fact she was hanging out with this new guy, but that's about it.

Then I find out she had the new guy MOVE IN with her the NEXT WEEK after she dumped me!!  WTF???  And slowly I woke up from my state of shock

**The Ugly Times:**
A few weeks ago from today (3 Months after the breakup)

**In these logs were the most shocking and disgusting thing I have ever had to find out: She had been cheating on me repeatedly over the entire relationship with her old ex boyfriend!!**  He asked her at one point if I ever suspected anything with ""all the fooling around we used to do"".  I nearly vomited!!  So I guess she cheated on me a ton somewhere during the beginning of our relationship.  Then in the logs from 1 and 2 years ago

We were hanging out often during this time period, and then hanging out with me the days before &amp; after, WITH NO SIGNS OF GUILT OR REMORSE!!  I never had a fucking clue!  It evidently didnt bother her at all!  WTF???  How can this be the same girl???  She was also making plans for us to move in together at this same time!!!

So after I find this out, because then I know you'll only admit to what you think I know.  I want you to come clean so I can at least have the comfort of finally knowing the truth about everything.  She absolutely refuses.  She actually had the nerve to say ""I dont know why we have to dwell on this.""!!!!  Are you fucking kidding me?  I find out she cheated on me the entire time and lied to my face, and she's irritated that I wont get over it instantly?  She was VERY OBVIOUSLY not prepared to take responsibility for what she did.

The ONLY thing she said was she was ""sorry you had to find that out.""  She's only sorry she got caught!

She said it was 2 guys, she never thought I would find this out, to which she replied ""Obviously"".  WTF!?

The chat logs prove she was cheating on me for at LEAST the first year and the last 2 years

Since then she has refused to respond to me to this day.  I sent her an angry email the next day

She has not responded at all.  This is so unlike her.  She talked to me a TON the first 2 months of the breakup.  She apologized repeatedly during that time, and it's been brutal as I slowly come to the realization that an apology may not arrive in my inbox anytime soon.

I seriously can't come to terms with this.  How could she be SO giving, and SUCH a wuss in general, but secretly be cheating on me the whole time?   How could it not bother her?  If I was upset at her for a trivial thing she'd be in tears normally, but she could cheat on me and see me the next day and show no signs of guilt??  And when I confronted her red handed on the phone, she didnt sound sad at all.  She sounded short and edgy and wanting to escape and to minimize the situation.

I have never been so deeply betrayed by anyone in my life.  Not even an enemy.  I am completely devastated.  I cant go 1 hour without being tormented by the pain of this.  I can hardly sleep at night.  The worst part is not knowing the truth.  As pathetic as it sounds

I have met pathological liars before and I hate them.  But let me tell you

Help me Reddit.  I dont have any close friends.  I am so fucking ashamed that I was tricked into giving 7 years of my life to this bitch

I'm mentally mind fucked by this constantly

What can I do to get her to address this to me?  It kills me that she got away with it.  She seems happy as can be with her new guy, I am tempted all the time to tell her how much I am suffering and how much she destroyed me and what a terrible person she is.  Without that, I feel she is able to pretend to herself that this has blown over and that I'm over it!  I want her to suffer for what she did!  She doesnt even feel sorry?

1. Nobody is obligated to have feelings for you.  Not even if you like them a whole lot

2. It's never wrong to like someone (but see point #1).

3. Keeping your feelings a secret to avoid rejection and not giving someone a chance to say ""yes"" doesn't do anyone any favors.

4. A relationship won't fix your life.  Neither will getting laid.

5. It helps a lot to figure out what you actually want when it comes to relationships

6. A lot of the stuff that initially attracts us to people isn't very relevant for good sex.  It's not all that relevant for good relationships

7. Just because you decide that the traditional standards aren't important doesn't mean that other people will.

8. There's nothing wrong with sex that's not part of a committed relationship.  There's nothing wrong with not wanting that

9. ""The number"" can mean so many things that it's meaningless.

10. Picking someone up at a bar or a party isn't a very useful model for sexualized interactions that don't take place at a bar or a party.

11. Flirting can be fun

12. If you can't decide if someone's playing ""hard to get"" or not, it's their loss.

13. No one gender is a gatekeeper to relationships or sex

14. If ""the mood"" is so fragile that one miscue can break it

15. Bad sex is not always preferable to no sex.

16. Men are not all commitment-phobic horndogs who will hump anything with a pulse.  Women are not all fickle

17. There's really no such thing as ""the one.""

18. If there's something you can't talk to your partner about

19. Sometimes relationships don't work out.  It doesn't always mean that one partner was right and the other was wrong

This is a throwaway simply because a lot of my friends and work associates use reddit and have me added as a friend. The truth is I'm embarrassed. In my line of work weakness isn't tolerable and I'd be a laughing stock.

I'm 32 years old. I met my girlfriend (we're calling her Joanne
I tried to track Joanne down through friends and the like - these were the days before facebook and I never used myspace. I finally got a hold of her number and when I rang she said she remembered me too. I asked her out on a date and we spent a lot of time together. Another guy in our social group fancied Joanne so we took it slow. We were very cryptic about how we felt and didn't even kiss until about a month of seeing each other. After that our relationship went off on a rocket and I'd never even dreamed of feeling that way before. We were inseparable (and intolerable no doubt). We went everywhere together and she loved the things I did and I loved the things she did. I'd never met a girl that got into things like snowboarding and surfing so quickly - and she loved it. I even took dance lessons and mastered the samba with her!

It's not been all sunshine and lollipops though and I'll be the first to admit - we've had our problems like any other couple. We broken up once about three years ago but wasn't apart for more than 3 months. We've lived both together and apart. Whatever happened I thought I'd been the most reasonable, that she couldn't abort it and I said I'd be with her no matter what. When she miscarried I took weeks off work to be by her side. I told her that I was there for no matter what - always. When she was kicked out of home because her parents moved to Australia I financially supported her until she got on her feet. These were tough times. It was hard for both of us but I felt we grew because of them. I felt that going through all this was something special. So I proposed on New Years Eve last year after taking her to the place we first met. (A bar with a rooftop balcony thing). I told her that we should see if it was open on the off chance before we went home at around 2am. She agreed but when we got there she noticed it wasn't a bar anymore. I already knew this beforehand and through my contacts I got in touch with the music shop owner and he let me use his roof. I took her up the fire escape and I had the whole roof almost exactly how it looked that that night, which included renting a huge fish tank and a bunch of Christmas lights, the whole thing set me back £600 - bitch. There was a table in the middle with two glasses and a bottle of champagne. I got down on one knee and she cried and said yes.

The last 6 months I've been working really hard. I'm in sales and we've had a potentially life-changing deal coming through that would make the company I'm with millions in the next 5-8 years. I haven't stopped working my arse off and I've told her it's going to be tough but that I'm doing it for us. if I get it, work was brilliant, the weather was beautiful, I had the perfect surprise and I couldn't wait to tell her.

Anyway when I arrived there was a shitty SUV parked outside that I had seen before but couldn't place. The penny didn't even drop when the door was unnaturally locked. I unlocked it and called her name, hug me - or something but I just threw her back down on the bed. I told her she disgusted me and I left.

I went straight to my car and she followed my out pathetically asking me to hear her story. I told her not to fucking call me and dropped my personal mobile out the window. I own a work one but it's blocked from anyone other than colleagues. I went home and got in the shower and just cried. I can't believe it. The more I think about the relationship the more I cry I thought about the miscarriage and cried and then my proposal and cried and the the first time I met her and I cried even more. I've not been in to work today. I called and told my boss everything. He's a great friend and on of three people who know. He's told me to have a holiday from work and that I've done more than enough in the last year. He told me to take a week and then see how I feel. She's been knocking on my door and calling my landline so I plugged it out. My friend stopped by earlier after he heard what happened from my boss. A lot of my friends are worried. They havent heard from me and can't get in contact because I dropped the phone.

**TL:DR: Love of my life cheated on me for some broke

Anyway reddit. I know the standard advice. I'm not looking for that. Can someone just please tell me WHY?!!!?? I loved her. I do love her. So fucking much. I just wanted us to be happy and I had worked so hard for that. All that hard work - it wasn't for me. It was for us. How could she fucking do this after she fucking miscarried my baby and I paid for stupid fucking art studies when her parents fucked off without a trace. I'm just confused. How could she fucking betray me after everything we've been through. I don't understand it. What would make a girl that loves you, that was with you for 7 years, that called you pet names, that you would cuddle and make love to. What would she do it? With this broke jackass. This piece of shit that couldn't support a fucking puppy.

As time went on she began to target me. She would call me (sometimes 7 times) just to ask me why I was ""trying to take her baby away"". She began trying to plant things in his head like, I have a job as a Computer Engineer and make a descent salary. In my opinion it is her that is constantly unhappy because her husband is a truck driver and she relies on him to support her.

Long story short, weird? Bc of her, he never was able to have a close relationship with his father. One of the final encounters was her bring the entire family (brother, sister, father, and herself) down and confronting me for turning her son ""against his family"". I began to cry because I had enough, she called me a bitch and my bf told them all to get out and hasn't spoken to them since.

We now live together and I try to speak to him about possibly reuniting with ATLEAST his younger brother and sister. He won't because he says his mom will find out and it is not worth the aftermath. He wont talk to ANYONE from his hometown because his mom has portrayed herself as a saint there and has only heard her side of the story. All they know is that her son

Please help me! What do I do? We live together now and it pains me to hear him say things like ""all I have now is you"", but it is different when your own family wont talk to you.

There is, but I suppose we've reached that reckoning point that happens about a year in where you really start to analyze the possibility of the thing being truly long term.

The sex is awful.

No, and I've had a lot. We're both aware of it, we've both talked about it, but it has never improved. The last time we spoke of it, she said that, in the grand scheme of things, she had come to realize that ""some things are less important than others"", and that good sex was worth sacrificing. Let me tell you - I WANT to agree. We're both in our 30s and have a great deal of perspective on relationships at this point ... but I guess my lizard brain is still fully functional

So

A bit of background - My sexuality was forged in the fires of fucked-upness. Aggressive, I am a long time musician with a great deal of rhythm. As you might well know, watching someone dance will give you a great deal of insight into what's going to happen in the bedroom. I really feel that, and I've always clicked sexually with jungle women that move sensually and polyrhythmically...

Now

On the dancefloor, and you'll quickly find that she's completely and utterly tone deaf.

In the bedroom? Watch how this matches up ...

Gentle as a fawn. Light as a feather. Stiff as a board. Plops down in missionary and lies motionless as she gets fucked. Rarely initiates moving out of that position. Doesn't thrust into me. Doesn't really make eye contact. Will *shush* me if i fuck her hard enough that the back of the bed hits the wall, but further complicates things) Doesn't suggest anything to me as far as making it better for her, and doesn't listen when I tell her things that would make it better for me.

She claims that she's had great sex before, I am really skeptical. She has even straightup admitted to me that the problem ""might be her"", but also I know that my own sexuality as described above might be a ""problem"" in the context of this loving, respectful relationship. In previous fulfilling sexual encounters, I got off on things like being punched, strangling, dangerous things ... and I can't even imagine bringing that into this beautiful

Reddit... What do you think? I can't stress enough. I LOVE THIS WOMAN DEARLY, I have unquenched raging sexual desire that is refusing to ignore this problem. 

She is SO, and helping people. I see that, I feel that and a part of me believes that PASSION is PASSION. Can it translate to sexual? How do I spark the fire in this woman's sex drive? Please help!

I waited until he'd woken up this morning to speak with him about all this. He immediately started off with another apology

I started by saying, then added, ""Especially knowing that I was just sitting at home, available to pick you guys up at a moment's notice.""

After a moment of silence

""But you were absolutely smashed when you got home

He shook his head. ""No

""Then how could you not have realized that when you got to your car?"" I asked.

He said, so that's why it didn't come out until I got back.""

I was quiet for a moment as I considered what he'd said. ""I don't really know what to say to that, regardless of how much you drank?""

He shrugged sheepishly. ""I guess not.""

We both fell silent. He looked fairly miserable.

After a minute or two, but you know the ramifications of drunk driving as well as I do -- probably better than I do.""

He nodded. Then he said

I cut him off. ""That doesn't make it okay.""

He pressed on: ""...so close to the house that it was even worse that I didn't call you. You could have been there in five minutes.""

""Distance doesn't matter, and I *still* would have come, without complaint.""

""I know.""

""I guess

To my surprise

We hashed it out further after that. Here are the main points:

* If he's going to drink
* If I'm unavailable to drive him
* If he's with a group of friends and they all end up drinking, even if he's positive he's sobered up.

After all this, agreeing to all the points I laid out.

I also informed him that if he *did* screw this up again, too, and apologized again, claiming firmly that he had no desire to hurt me (emotionally) or anyone else (physically).

All in all... everything went better than expected.

I'll talk to Jim (my best friend) today as well. From what my boyfriend's told me, honestly thought he was sober enough to drive. I just need to let Jim know that if the two of them ever go drinking again, they are to call a sober friend to pick them up, be it me, Jim's girlfriend, or any other friend they choose to contact.

So she finally came into the hospital and talked to me today. She sat down on my bed and started crying. She started out saying it was all her fault I tried to kill myself and that she was sorry for everything

So that “Friend” who got molested? That was her. She got raped by her grandfather when she was really young. Which I guess explains why she was always just as weird about sex as me. I just thought we had a quirk in common; it's one of the reasons we got together, because it was the most horrifying, fucked up story I’ve ever been told and she deserves privacy. Just suffice to say very very bad things.

She says she got this really bad case of fight-or-flight and kind of did both when I started talking about rape. She wasn’t expecting it and she couldn’t handle it. Which I can sort of understand

I tried to talk to her, slamming the door shut behind her. About twenty minutes later she posted to facebook. I almost didn’t read it. I wish I hadn’t.

Quote: “So [me] thinks he’s been raped. Fan-fucking-tastic. It just pisses me off so much when men think they can comprehend the pain women go through when they’ve been violated like that.”

A few of my friends reacted with surprise. Her friends all started ganging up to bitch me out as the bad guy and told her she was right to break up with me.

My cell phone has been ringing nonstop with my mom. I’m afraid to answer it. I don’t want her to know.

She blames us (me and my son) for ruining her life and taking away her dreams. She is a stay at home mom who hates it but doesn't get a job.

She has been telling me that she wants a divorce since our son was two years old - but has never gone through with it. My son and I have done our best to get her out of her depression (help with counseling, etc). But she screams at us at the slightest provocation (real or imaginary) and is verbally abusive towards us on a regular basis. 

Last week she and I had a horrible fight, do more than my fair share), that I must be gay, and that I am not a real man, etc. etc. So we got into a screaming match (my son was in school so he didn't hear/see it).  My son told me today that a couple of days ago my wife told him that she didn't love me, that she hated were we live and living with us, that she hates the people in our city and that she only stays because of him (and that he should be grateful to her for staying and making all those sacrifices for him only) - she told me the same thing during our fight.

I need to confront her as we had agreed not to involve our son in any of our confrontations - what would be a good approach to confront her without involving him?

I figured that was that....until he began bringing up having a MFF threesome again.  Honestly, while the MMF threesome was amazing.  When my boyfriend brought up the MFF threesome again, I joking suggested that he would have to reciprocate by inviting another guy to join us.

I don't want to tell my fiance who has just gotten over her grandmothers death from cancer.,throwaway21281,129,26,35,"Earlier this week I (31m) was feeling really bad abdominal pain and nausea left work and went to the doctor. The doctor ran some tests and sent me home. The next day I was still not feeling better the doctor called me to come in and said that my blood work was abnormal and that he wanted to run a ultrasound and a ct scan to find out what was causing the problem. After the tests he told me that he had found a mass on my pancreas and was going to take a biopsy. So they did the biopsy and the doctor sat me down and told me that I have pancreatic cancer that it is at an advanced stage. I asked the doctor what were my chances with treatment he told me 4%. He then went on to tell me how they were going to treat it. Surgery lots of chemo and that they would tackle it very aggressively but that the odds were still long. I asked for the night to think about it. He was reluctant but let me go and told me that if they are going to start treatment it is going to need to be very soon. came home and decided to ask reddit.

Now I haven't told anyone I didn't even tell my fiance lets call her Tiffany (27f) that I was going to the doctor because I did not want to worry her if it was nothing. About us we moved out to the country from the city about 8 months ago 2 months after I proposed. We did so because her grandmother was diagnosed with cancer of the lymphnodes that it was terminal and they gave her six months after she declined treatment. I quit my job and we moved in with her and cared for her for 8 months when she passed in July. Tiffany took it extremely heard trying to hold everything in before breaking down she still is not over her passing. she has started snuggling more tightly and has become more clingy and affectionate. Her family offers no support to her at all if not the opposite. 
She calls me her rock I am always there for her. I can not bear to tell her. I cant watch her heart break not again.  I don't know what to do. I really don't want to do the treatments I would rather have quality over quantity with the odds that low. I don't want to go to work either not when I don't have that much time left.

1306939663.0,hp3n6,Update: Asked for advice on marriage ending and getting out with the kids,memoryman,116,10,89,"**tldr; took the kids and GTFO

Here's the OP:
http://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/h0cgf/i_did_an_ama_over_a_year_ago_link_in_text_and/

and here's the link to the original AMA:
http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ajm2v/my_wife_had_total_global_amnesia_all_long_and/

Can't believe it's been almost a month already... I went back and looked at where I left off with the first thread and a LOT has happened…

Here's the abridged version

She was really starting to make me nervous

Went outside and called my lawyer (hadn't met yet)… told her what was going on before she jumped in and told me to GTFO now, just go. Told me to get the kids and stop by the local PD and tell them my lawyer advised me to GTFO and let them know what I was doing and that it was on the advice of my attorney. 

Went to the PD with the intent of just letting them know what I was doing but they wanted to chat. Turns out the officer I was speaking with had been at my house that morning. He seemed suspicious and while we talked the kids colored in the other room. Turns out they talked to my son but we told the exact same version of events. The officer left me to talk with his supervisor and when he came back his demeanor had changed. He told me my wife told him a similar version of events but without the violence towards my son... essentially she said we argued

Ended up staying at a friend's house

The next morning I met with my attorney and we immediately went down to the courthouse and I filed a protection order against their mom on behalf of both kids. It went surprisingly quick... the magistrate heard from me before talking to my son. My attorney said it usually takes a bit longer to convince the judge a PO is in order.

Full hearing was set for the next week but until then my wife could have zero contact with the kids. That weekend I met with a local cop to drop by the house and pick up some clothes for me and the kids to find about 8 garbage bags full of our stuff in the corner of the garage. She'd thrown out a ton of our things... cloths, medicine, you name it... and some of it was clearly mixed with garbage. I took the whole pile and threw it in my vehicle as well as anything else I could grab.

The next week we filed an abuse and neglect complaint against my wife. Thursday morning we met before the final PO hearing and decided to delay that until next week and come up some sort of temporary custody agreement that we could bring to the magistrate for the initial abuse and neglect hearing (abuse and neglect is out of the juvenile court and trumps anything from the PO

We eventually came to a verbal agreement but not until both attorneys told my wife she was being completely unreasonable and the magistrate could force an agreement down her throat if need be. The agreement was to get the kids back in the house and have my parents come down to stay with them until the hearing but come next for the initial abuse and neglect hearing my wife said she's not leaving the house under any circumstances. So she stays in the house and I get full temporary custody of the kids. Even the court advocate for the kids can't believe she chose the house over fighting for visitation.  My lawyer is really happy and its a big win for me but I'm running out of leave for work and now I have to find alternate housing and daycare. 

Before this past memorial day weekend I get an email demanding visits with both kids over the weekend. The agreement was that they would be supervised, especially my son, have been vocal about not wanting to see her. My son is extremely angry with her as am I. The more we've been away from her the more the three of us have realized how bad things were and there's nothing I won't do to protect them and make sure nothing like this ever happens again. I call my lawyer and explain what's happening and she shuts down all the talk of visits. On top of that my wife slipped and mentioned that her father was coming down to work on the house (another story) so I figured her plan was to have the kids meet her family for the first time. My wife has been estranged from her family for the last 15 years. Her mother kicked her out of the house after an argument (also slapped her up and choked her, holding her against the wall as she took her house keys from her) and she has had zero contact with them until I left with the kids. Now they've fully reconciled and she thought it would be a great idea to introduce the kids to grandparents they've never met during the same visit with a mother that abused and neglected them.

Its insane that she still hasn't had a mental evaluation and the kids and I have been in therapy the last three weeks. FYI I got a clean bill of mental health from my psych dr and he's not even recommending meds. Thinks I'm doing extraordinarily well considering everything we've been through. Kids are doing pretty well

So the next thing we have is a pre-trial in another two months unless my wife negotiates some plea and custody deal I find acceptable.

Ask away

1302158757.0,gkjzg,My ex was just arrested for DUI+child endangerment,hubbyofhoarder,123,16,50,"My ex ( http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/bqfae/iama_guy_who_was_married_and_will_soon_divorce_a/?sort=top ) was just arrested for DUI and child endangerment.

I got a call on my cell around midnight from her; it was a ""butt dial"". She didn't speak into the phone, or he was home alone (and he's 10, which would not be okay).  

I called her, who waited outside while I tried to get her to come out.  After about an hour, the police left. Although they didn't believe that she was in the house, they didn't have cause to forcibly enter.  They were apologetic, and gave me some good suggestions, but eventually left.

I continued to wait outside.  After about 10 minutes, she was arrested, and charged with child endangerment and driving under the influence.  I got her house keys from her, entered her house, and retrieved my son.  Before he came down, I had them put her in the police car, so that he wouldn't have to see his mom in handcuffs. I took pictures of her crazy hoarder house; if I stop freaking out

The cop was sympathetic, and let the DA figure out what charges would stick. She's already on probation for another DUI she got in December, and had been admitted to an accelerated rehabilitation program.  She's going to have both sets of charges leveled against her now, and is nearly certainly going to jail, at least for a little while.

Fuck

Update: This morning I applied for a temporary Protection from Abuse order from our local court system.  My ex is to have no contact with my son

Update 2: The advice about posting the pictures was very well received

Update 3: her hearing on the child endangerment charge is today. Please

Update 4: I submitted the pics I took during the incident, they would help her clean and organize.  Hopefully my ex will agree. I have a feeling she's just going to be pissed off, though.

Update 5: Went to court this morning for the Protection from Abuse Order.  Ex offered to sign over full residential custody of my son to me, but honestly it just feels shitty.

Update 6--I'm sure no one is still monitoring this, living in her bananas hoarder house.  My son is with me all the time now, she has 2 non-overnight visits a week.  

My ex signed papers to allow me to move with my son to a district that is one of the best in the state in which I live, and watch her continuing to descend into chaos.  I can't/don't want to fix her problems, but it still hurts me to watch someone who was a part of my life for nearly 20 years kill herself slowly.

Update 7--In new district, 2 B's, hooray!).  He was a little behind in his reading compared to his peers in his district, so he's getting daily help from the reading specialist.  His mom is in jail for 90-180 days.  ",,False,,True,t3_gkjzg

Edit: This couple isn't asking for their own place they want to move some other friend into my room. To say again with all honesty we are all on good roommate grounds i was really taken aback with this request. 

Edit Part Duex: For clarity the landlord knows about the dog and girl. She is absolutely furious and always bickers about it but other than that we are good quiet tenants whose rent is never late. It usually falls to me to go handle things with her because Tony is such a dick to her (straight up walking past her while shes talking, his girlfriend is taking the bar right now and has been moonlighting doing landlord property law stuff for tenants on the side! Yikes..


**Update:** I'm going to talk to him tonight. She is in full on BAR study mode and won't be there but even if she was it would be him and i having the conversation anyway. You guys have armed me with a ton of knowledge and a lot of ways to gain the upper hand but I'm going to naively have a conversation man to man about how this isn't fair because..... ----&gt;

In an interesting turn of events the landlord just came down because the room above me has a burst pipe and wanted to check my walls with the plumber. While he was doing his thing she informed me she called the doctors office where the fake service dog note came from and the doctor said he had no recollection of the dog

At this point i think no matter what i no longer want to live with these two. Talking to you guys had made me realize that i shouldn't have to put up with this stuff and i can have an awesome living situation with honest people if i go look for it. I feel like an abused spouse realizing i don't need to take this shit anymore haha. I will for SURE update with what ends up happening!!

One week ago I tried to initate some intimacy/sexy time with my wife after a TV show we watch together had ended as we were sitting on the couch snuggling and watching TV wile she was wearing a sexy camisole/thong set that I had asked her to put on earlier in the evening. She rebuffed my advance (kissing her neck softly and asking her if she would like to go to the bedroom) by telling me that she would be happy ""never having sex again"" (her exact words). I was devestated


She has since cut off any sexual activities and gets openly hostile when I try to initiate. This is the culmination of a slow decline in intimacy in our marriage over the past few years. I am 33 she is 34 We have 3 children together all under 4years old and she is at home on a maternity leave while I work full time Mon-Fri. When we were dating she was full of passion and put effort into making love. She is multi orgasmic and would normally have 5-10 orgasms every time we had sex. I have never had any erectile or performance issues.


When we were making babies we were having sex twice a day until she discoved that she was pregnant


I assist with housework and child rearing a considerable amout (much more than many other husbands I know) but I could be doing more in this regard (ie waiting on them hand and foot and taking no time for myself).


In the last month she has starting spending all of her free time playing facebook games and watching television shows to the exclusion of anything else. She has a passion for playing a particular sport and will be starting this month one night a week playing it on a local recreational team.


I do not suspect her of cheating on me and have never cheated or could cheat on her. I was cheated on once by a past girlfriend and know how devestating it feels. She in not on birth control and has not been on the pill for years. Birth control has been managed surgically since the birth of our last baby. I have asked her to attend marriage counceling with me and she has agreed


I do not understand why she has chosen to deny me the love and closeness that I need from sexual intimacy with her.


AMA or provide advice please. This situation has made me terribly depressed and I am willing to do anything and put in enormous effort to resuming a healthy relationship with her.

About a month ago, she asked me not to go to a BBQ with her that we had been mutually invited to, and later that night drunk texted me to pick her up (I didn't, she got a ride from the host.)

4 days after I left, walked in on her with another guy on my living room couch, totally wasted and semi-clothed.  Cops called, he left.

Since that time, waking up on the couch in the morning too drunk to take the kids to school, having her debit card stolen by another guy who slept with her on the couch.

She has previous substance abuse issues and seems to have rekindled that.  She continues to see the first guy who gives her Percocet and marijuana.  He is an ex-convict with a felony record

I was hesitant/proud at first to come here … thinking that I could always figure things out on my own. However I’ve come to realize that part of growing up also involves asking for help/advice … even if from strangers. Thus… thank you in advance.

**LONG BACKGROUND STORY IS LONG.**

Ex (F), sexy, intelligent girl could become such a special person in my life. **She had become more of a friend that my childhood BFF (M)**.  Until she came along he’s been the one who knows me like the back of his hand. There was nothing that he and I couldn’t talk about. He’s always pulled through for me when I needed him, and vice-versa. 

Now it was her whom I’d confide in; I would listen to her problems and give her the best advice I could. We would spend time together, here we are talking about someone so special that **I was afraid to lose that connection we had if things ever went sour**.


Ultimately it happened, but then I abandoned myself into the feeling and we ended up making out (quite heavily too, as all that bottled-in feelings came rushing out). From that day onwards we got to know each other better. 


We started spending more and more time together, and you can’t imagine how happy I was when she agreed to it**. 


Time went on, we’re both geeky and we get each other so well. Even when we were apart we would make sure we’d talk every day no matter the time difference. **I guess to the eyes of an objective observer, we were grossly cutesy with each other**. Communication had never been an issue with us, even when we argued we never fought, always tried to keep calm and deal with things in an educated manner. There was nothing we wouldn’t talk about and we managed to see things in a similar way. I think it was this ability of integrating to each other’s life which made things so smooth.


**I knew then that getting into a relationship with her was the right choice and I was happy with it
Our rough spots occurred when we had to switch into an LDR, and I felt helpless as I have difficulty in showing my feeling from far away. It started to really play around with my head, what did I really feel for this girl? Was I having second thoughts? And **seeing how everything else between us had gone by so quickly, (in the sense that since that first kiss… we moved forward insanely fast), I wanted to make sure that saying “I love you” would be something special**. 


Time went on and I still couldn’t shake off the whole friend thing. We reached the point were now we were dreading the day when college was going to end. She asked me on different occasions “what was my plan”


**HERE IS WHAT'S UP NOW.**


**We went our separate ways, there was a lingering hope that we’d try again as soon as we’d deal with some things. A couple of months went by and we started making new friends etc. **I offered to take some time apart for her to try to spend some more time with her new friends**. I felt as if she needed to invest some time in those friendships, go out and have some fun. 


During that time apart, I started seeing things so much clearer. I couldn’t understand how I could have been so blind, so stupid, so damn childish. 


I realized through time that this girl was not only someone with whom I had such a special connection with… this girl had become someone I’d come to love. **I was so fixated with the fear of losing our friendship that I kept myself from really seeing things for what they truly were**. Essentially I lied to myself … and shelled in my feelings so that I wouldn’t get hurt? **how could I have become so selfish?** Who was this hypocrite who stared me through bathroom the mirror? I gave it more thought. I tried to detach myself from it by trying to keep myself busy


I talked to her again and I confessed to her everything. **I told her how I felt about everything


I’d like to believe I always was good to her, I’m glad to have told her how I truly felt. I would hate to give up on this romantic campaign on my own accord because of how I feel, and because of how stubborn I am.


I wish I hadn’t taken so long to realize things


**TL;DR= Ex and broke up after approx two years (including some LDR gaps). I’m penitent for not having realized things earlier and I’d like to give it a second shot. I humbly ask for some advice on how to proceed with this.**

**tl;dr** *Dad has gone through crazy personality changes after brain surgery. Neither of my parents know how to cope -- he thinks he's right and she can't get past the fact he's so different. They want my advice and I don't know what to do



**Background context**
Out of nowhere at the beginning of January, he'd lose his ability to walk and might have to eat from a tube, as the tumor was in a location that controlled mobility and gag reflexes/swallowing. When he woke up, he was fine! He was able to eat, to walk, the works. But then we started noticing the other differences... the personality differences.



**Personality changes**

* *Old dad - Moderately religious:* He'd go to church on Sundays
* *New dad - Born-again crazy religious with a God complex:* I know this is kind of common with people who have near-death experiences, praise the lord!"" and all kinds of phrases he's never said in his life.  And you cannot have ONE conversation with him without it turning to religion. He even yelled at the preist from the audience one Sunday, ""Cut through the bullshit! Get to the word of God!"" 
(Ok

* *Old dad - quiet, polite* - He used to be so sweet and quiet. He never questioned authority and never went out of his way to cause problems for other people. He always tried to be as much of an inconvenience as possible. He would get really uncomfortable when my brother and I (both in our 20s) talked about things like sex, even in a joking context. Example: My brother mentioned something at Christmas about that one monkey that masturbates, and my dad was so uncomfortable he had to leave. He was polite, mellow. But now...
* *New dad - loud, then his brain tumor would have been a waste and I would have put him through it for nothing. (then, when I cried, he got super happy and praised the lord, thinking he had ""absolved me of my sins""). OH AND HE ALSO NEVER SHUTS THE F UP. Which is kind of nice, if he talked about things that made sense. But he talks for hours and hours and hours on end about weird things like the best way to eat soup or prune a flower. 

* *Old dad - very logical, so his English is a little shaky, but he’s extremely smart. He’s worked for Boeing, did aeronautical work for MacDonald Douglas. He’s very engineering and math oriented. I never thought he was stupid or made bad judgment calls in life.
* *New dad - irrational, he emailed all his bosses and his bosses bosses to tell him he came up with some solution at work. He works for the prison system in the state of California, so this means he emailed some really high-up people in the state. He emailed this ridiculously crazy-long rambles that made no sense and basically spammed the fuck out of them. This was to like 30+ people, which got him and his boss in some trouble.  He’s tried calling all the congressmen in California to tell them he came up with the solution to the debt crisis. He seriously believes he’s found it, but won’t tell anyone else about it because he doesn’t want us to steal his idea. He’s tried to get in touch with my friend who works in Congress to see if she can connect him with the president. He has asked my brother and myself to quit our jobs to help him with his startup. We don’t know exactly what the startup is, but from the weird use cases he’s explained to us in snippets, it sounds like Craigslist meets the IRS meets Flickr meets the Bible -- and that’s only “one-onehundredth” of the idea. He always thinks he’s right about everything and if you attempt to question his logic, he becomes irrationally defensive and brushes it off as us not having the knowledge to comprehend his high-level thinking. 

We try to rationalize with him. I try to understand the new way he sees the world and I try not to treat him like he’s crazy, it's 1 a.m. and we've been on the phone for five hours and I have to wake up at 6:00 for work so I should go"" he gets really mad and says that we're not worth his time and we don't deserve to hear his ideas since we're not fully committed. Says things like, ""But if you could possibly change the world by hearing my ideas, why WOULDN'T YOU skip a night's sleep to hear that?"" There's no rationalizing.

So these are just a few examples. And yes



 **What’s happening now.**

So, she gets frustrated and it all devolves into arguments. All day. Every day. Crying. Punching walls. Name calling. 

Here are a few snippets from both of my parents’ sides of the issue. Of course

An email my dad wrote to my mom. I tried to clean up the writing where I could but some of it still doesn’t make sense
&gt; I do the things I do believe it or not with the intention of making things better.  Until you believe that and are willing to listen to my cries, gotten that “you're weird” look, accused of being crazy (even retarted),  not taken seriously, pitied, yelled at.  People in general, wanted the old me, I was brought back to this World with this new me

So, but he thinks he's in the right and that he makes sense and that he's better this way. But he is also a huge asshole but completely incapable of realizing that he’s an asshole. It's so so sad. Here’s another email he sent my mom to explain, logically, why he called her an ungrateful bitch. Please note that he doesn’t apologize:

&gt; Why did I call you an ""ungrateful bitch""? I called you that because you don't seem to realized that I have unconditional love for you.  You don't realized that the things I do for you are unconditional.  I don't expect anything in return

When you hear this side, too. Here’s an excerpt:

&gt; I don't know how much longer I can do this. There is nothing I can do right. From the moment we found out about that fucking tumor to this minute I have done nothing but piss you off. I tried to care for you, you turn it into an argument or you don't even hear what I say because you are already formulating your comeback.  I leave you alone, stay out of your way and speak only when necessary,   you call me sulky, pissy, mad. I have tried and tried. No matter what I say or do you question it. Why did I say it like that? What does that mean? Even a simple 'good morning"" causes you to get mad at me. [ …] The only time we talk is when we are fighting.  I don't know how to be normal around you anymore. I'm afraid to do or say anything because I know how it is going to turn out. I can't put on a happy face and say everything with enthusiasm and cheerfulness like you want. I try to be supportive and encouraging but the more I try the harder you knock me down.

And more about that ‘ungrateful bitch’ line:

&gt;You say I'm an ungrateful bitch because I am not rejoicing in your recovery, more than you will ever know. I am grateful you have your memory, or most of it anyways. I am grateful you are walking and talking. I am grateful for you.  I carry so much guilt because I can see myself, hear myself get angry with you. Yes, I scream and yell. Today, I hit the wall. I don't know how to get through to you. I hate being this miserable, sad, weak person. 


**What I’ve tried to do**

I am so, “Listen to her when she talks. Don’t interrupt. Actually listen to the words out of her mouth and wait until she ends a sentence before you start talking.”  Of course, he hasn’t been able to do that. He really does know something’s wrong and he really does want to change, but he’s not capable right now. 

I’m also sad for my mom because she’s at home dealing with all this alone right now. This guy, reference old memories, etc). But that’s super easy for me to say when I’m on the outside. 

**In conclusion**

My mom started her own bank account and moved some money over in case she needs to get away. All they do is yell and scream at each other. They’re both incredibly unhappy right now and are asking me for help. I’ve never been married! I have my own problems to deal with at work and in my own life. In a way I feel selfish because it’s like

Does ANYONE have advice? What should I do? Anyone have experience with brain tumor patients who have had a simliar about-face? Did it end well? How do I help them both keep happy and understand each other? ANYTHING PLEASE.

I'm a very laid back person.  I'm also very sexually expressive and love to do kinky things in bed and hear stories that are ""wrong"" and ""nasty"".  My boyfriend and I have been together for three years.  Over the course of these three years, but not too crazy, and also knowing when we need to chill and just have ""normal"" sex.  It's been great being with someone, finally, that I feel I can share my sexual thoughts with and he understands.  We have a great relationship otherwise as well.  We have the occasional disagreement, but everyone does and it usually passes in under an hour.  We are both 28 yrs old and live together (along with another roommate). 
 
I met him through my sister...his, we actually all lived together with 3 other roommates.  At the beginning of our relationship, I was a bit suspicious that perhaps he had a crush on her.  They had been friends for so long, it was a little intimidating!  He reassured me that he held no romantic feelings for her and that I had nothing to worry about.  I had no reason not to believe him.  Now, this part may sound a little weird, but our group of friends is a little strange, and we behave as such.  Over the years, but occasionally)

This brings me to a few weeks ago.  I was on my boyfriend's computer...he has a desktop set up in the living-room and I usually just use this, well, until after this and now I feel as if I have to check everything).  It opened to a folder that was labeled ""p"".  I had never seen this before and was intrigued (even excited that he had some new porn that I hadn't seen), so I opened it up.  Right away, I knew I wasn't going to want to see what was in the next set of folders.  They were labeled with the letters of his exes...I recognized this at once.  I felt a pit in my stomach, as I realized that he must know these are still here, because my letter is there too, he could have at least spoke with me about it so this moment would never happen.  OR JUST DELETE THEM!!!  Well, again

I told my sister and she came over and looked at them.  She had taken them years ago for an ex and the only copies she knew existed were on her computer and perhaps, in fact, go onto her computer and get the topless photos of my sister to put on his own computer.  He confessed to me that he had masturbated to all of the pictures I mentioned previously, but not in a very long time (a year at least).  
Sorry this is getting a bit long, so I have been there for him throughout that, and now finally have a moment to sit and think.  We have kissed a few times and been intimate once since I found these.  I can't do stuff with him without feeling like I'm going to puke.  I get physically ill after we kiss a lot and just feel utterly disgusted.  I don't know if I can ever get over this.  Has anyone else experienced anything similar?  What did you do to get past this?  I realize the possibility is there that we will just have to break up.  I don't know...my sister is very upset still as well.  She isn't speaking with him at the moment and I know that's hurting him a lot (as it should).  I love him, and I would love to get over this and put it behind us, I just don't know if I can.  

Any advice would be welcome.

After finding him hitting on girls from his past on fb, I told him he had to go to counseling. He was diagnosed with a sex addiction and told it would take 1-2 years of therapy to kick. He went 3 times. 

He has gotten better

Last week I checked his browsing history again and found he was checking girls out on twitter. The porn was bad enough for me

He says he loves me and can't live without me, but then I found him looking at other girls. 

After I found him looking at other girls this last time

The kicker? I would have been gone a long time ago

EDIT: Just sent him this email:
You aren't going to like this email. I've done a lot of thinking while you were gone

I don't want to be your parent. I don't want to have to constantly check your behavior. I want you to make your own decisions based off of Jacob's and my worth to you. Thus far

I've been agonizing a lot since I discovered you looking at girls on Twitter. I've tried to find ways in my mind to rationalize your behavior. I can't find any. There are girls who will be fine with you looking at other women on fb and Twitter as well as indulging in porn. I am not one of them. I have been completely faithful to you and even deleted potential relationship interests off fb because I was devoted to you. You have not done this. 

I have been friendly with you in our conversations because I didn't want to distract you from your season. This has been hard for me because I hate acting a lie. I can hide this lie from you no more. 

When we first began dating, excited eyes. I no longer have that unadulterated love for you. When I look at pictures of you, I see a man filled with uncontrolled lust and his cock in his hand.

You don't appreciate me. I do so much for you and it isn't returned. I want a man who showers me with love and affection and you don't. Telling me how much you love me isn't enough. It just isn't. 

I think with your porn, funny, sweet, caring, thoughtful, and genuine, and I love you and give myself freely and yet you still indulge in porn of the trashy type. You have the best of both worlds. I can't give that to you anymore. 

I am looking for a job that will support Jacob and me. I will never take him from you

Me, things with us have been wonderful.  Things with our neighbor, however, have not.  I'll take this time to say how this is not her apartment.  It's her cousin Paul's apartment, whom Ted has had a nice relationship with before.  Apparently she is staying there because he goes away on business a lot.

The first interaction we've had I will take responsibility for.  It was late on a Thursday night/Friday Morning

Well at one point we heard banging on our floor, how she has kids and how she didn't appreciate us walking around in high heels at 2 am.  I felt horrible, my boyfriend basically said not to worry, just take shoes off as we enter the apt and basically live and learn (this is my first time living in an apt building, not a house).  

Later on that day when I get home from work there is another note taped to our door saying ""Paul says call him within 24 hours or he's going to call management"" I told Ted

At this point he explained to her that we get home late on Thursdays but we will do our best to keep it down as to not disturb her.  She understands.  He also makes a point to tell her that we may have guests over on weekends but never later than 1 or 2.  She understood and from what he said

2nd interaction:  One Friday night we have 4 friends over.  We were playing games at our dining table with the LA/VAN game on in the background.  The TV is no louder than any other night.  The table has a carpet under it but it doesn't go out too far.  At one point a friend pulled out her chair

Next day comes and another note... this one a little more aggressive.  It went somewhat along the lines of ""It's 1 am and I am disturbed by you again with chairs being pulled out and the TV blasting.  At this point don't bother coming downstairs to say sorry cause you must think you got game.  Well I'm gonna go down to management and that's gonna be the final game.  Don't bother coming down or calling because I'm done talking.""  My boyfriend and I are pretty livid at this point.  This woman basically expects us to be silent in our own apartment.  He tells me to not do anything, we'll explain our side.

Weeks go by and not a thing until Monday night.  We had spent the whole day (9am-7pm) moving my furniture over.  I spent an hour putting the bedroom together

While getting out I hear the doorbell ring.  It was the same security guard saying the same thing.  Noise disturbance

Yesterday afternoon after my boyfriends gets home from work, security rings the bell.  My boyfriend gets out of bed and answers it.  He said the same thing as always.  Noise complaints about banging.  My boyfriend opens the door all the way to show that the apartment is dark and that we are in bed.  The security guard says ok and leaves.  We go to sleep.

This morning my boyfriend wakes up and tells me he has a voicemail from the neighbor.  It went kinda like this 

""YO this is your neighbor from downstairs.  You have disturbed me and my children for the last and final time.  The banging at 1:30 in the morning is unacceptable. I guess you think its a game and that's why you would lie to my face and you say you are sorry and you continue to do what you do.  At this time I'm calling managements office.  I'm going to make an arrangement to speak to them face to face because you and your girlfriend are gonna stop the nonsense.  I don't know what crap you did while Paul was here but you know what Paul is not here now.  I'm here and I'm going to be respected.  Just like I respect others around me

Now like I said

So my question is

UPDATE: The property manager spoke with my boyfriend.  He said that when security gets a complaint they are obligated to go to the apartment in question and ""access the situation"".  The property manager said we're in the clear, maybe he can explain to her that our apartment is in compliance with the lease (as far as carpeting and whatnot) and at this point we aren't doing anything wrong.  Worse case scenario is if she keeps contacting security and they keep coming here we can call the police and bring them into it because at this point it's considered harassment.

UPDATE #2: It's 11:30 pm on Wednesday.  Doorbell just rang yet again.  It was security saying that they're getting complaints that there's ""a lot of movement"".  At this point the only movement was me moving the 20 feet from the bedroom to the couch.  We'll be calling Paul tomorrow.

Background: 
Im 31
I work 5 days a week
2 year old in daycare 3 days per week. 
4 year old in school 4 and half days a week
Married 3 years.

about me:
I have always had ED. Cannot have sex without viagra/cialis. Recently confirmed low testosterone which I am in treatment for but doesnt seem to be helping much.

My sex drive is low

about her
flunked out of college shortly after we got together
put on a lot of weight since she got pregnant with the first child
she is depressed
ambition to do 'something'; she doesnt know what yet

my issue with her:
I work all day every day in a very tough but well paying job.
This afforded us the luxury of her not having to work and could stay home with the kids. The plan was when the kids were both in school that she woiould go back to school and get a degree in something so she could get a fulfilling job. 
Meanwhile

My argument is that if I am working it is not unreasonable for me to expect 10-15 hours per week of housework from her.
Her argument: fuck you I am not going to do that demeaning stuff

I vented my spleen and told her that I think she is being lazy and making me feel like I am being used for money

She countered with ""if you wanted to have sex more I wouldnt feel so shit and would do the cleaning""

Maybe that's true

She then says that shes had enough of me not wanting to fuck her.

It's a catch 22

AM I being an asshole in expecting her to do stuff around the house?
Is it really possible that this kind of stress could be affecting my libido?

I have known this family for about 5 years now and they have been lovely to me since I taught their eldest son
I knew there was a lot of conflict amongst this otherwise glossy family at the end of the year. I also had noted that one of the things she told me about her new house/room that was exciting was a lock on her door. I thought it was weird but anyway. 
After a long discussion as a response to me planning on inviting her family to my son's birthday it came out that her brother had been sneaking into her room at night since she was 8 until 18 and raping her. Motivated by her boyfriend who found out she told her parents. 
They disbelieved her but eventually put a lock on the door and pay for her to see a psychologist. 
That's it. 
She wasn't feeling good about her psychologist
But then her Dad said the caring side had disappeared and she had turned into a B-- since going to counselling. 
So she's quitting. 
And she won't see someone else.

Story:


I am very depressed currently, being unable to attend school right now... And feeling insecure.


My boyfriend said negative things about my body in the past that have really hurt me. It makes it hard to believe the positive things he says now



Well, basically the whole time. He was telling me that he didn't mean that, or any of the other stuff he said and he thinks I'm beautiful and it's really annoying to have this conversations with me because I tell him that he doesn't really think that and bring up something else he said that was the opposite. I told him he wouldn't have said the negative so much if he didn't think that they were true.



He says I see him at the best of times and the worst when he doesn't want anyone around. Also that we just need a healthy amount of space, but that the other way is okay.



Anyway, and I tossed my shoes. Literally only a few feet and not with any force. He thought I was trying to throw them at his fish tank and freaked out. The rest of the story is in TL;DR, I don't want to type it again.



Anyway. Is there any chance this is a one time thing? It is partially my fault for purposely trying to annoy him


He apologized and we spent the rest of the night together, it's a long process for me. But, more than that, I love him so, so much. He is very kind a lot of the time, and we have similar interests. When we are doing well, we're so good. I feel like we can rise above this and it will work out.


TL;DR Last night, so he grabbed my head and hit it into the wall. After I went over to him, freaking out about what he did, he wrestled me to the ground, punching me in the shoulder, then round house punched me in the face so hard I saw stars and my face swelled up twice its normal size. I now have a black eye, but the swelling went down.

I went to the hospital this morning. I was choking on phlegm in the back of my throat and nose and just could not breathe. The lack of oxygen was making me dizzy too. I called the tele-nurse, saying that my wife was already in the shower and that I was certain she'd have no trouble taking me. After all, I'd take her if the tables were turned.
 
Instead, wasting our time and money by going to the hospital. In essence, that I was being a big baby. It was only after her boss TOLD her to leave that she came to the hospital. By that time, I was already there... having driven when I was dizzier than most of the St. Paddies celebrants on the road tonight.
 
When we left the hospital a few hours later, it was once again very clear that I was wasting her time. I'll be honest. I didn't have the energy to fight about it. On top of that, she and the girls spent TWO HOURS going to McDonalds after work... and when she got home I was informed that I needed to take Kairi to the doctor tomorrow on an unrelated issue. Because, after all, I'm not working on Friday.
 
This whole thing has just left me filled with a profound sense of anger... and of insight. Were the tables turned (and there are times that they have been)
 
This is nothing new
 
Maybe this is just a product of the various medicines I'm taking... maybe I shouldn't be taking this argument public now... but what it keeps coming back to in my mind is her whole attitude that my being in the hospital- by instruction of a medical professional- left her ""Annoyed"".

It just happens that my birthday also falls on Memorials Day this year and our anniversary is just 3 day afterwards. I want to clarify that he has made the decision to go, it was a simple ""I have decided to go with them to Cancun on Memorials Day weekend."" At first I assumed that I would be going too, but after asking him, he actually said ""i enjoy spending time with that group of ppl, i dont think its too much to expect to do something with them without you.""  

In the beginning of our relationship, I believe that I've proven through the time we've been long distance, that in fact I can handle myself quite well.  

Currently, he said that in fact he does care. He said he thought it would be fine since his friends picked a random weekend and plans to get back to the west coast  by 1pm (PST)--4pm my time--and is willing to skype me on my birthday. And he says we can Skype on our anniversary too. Conversely, I'd rather that instead of planning to go with his friends that weekend, he come visit me in the east coast to celebrate our anniversary and my birthday. It's rare that he gets a day off from work, and it was perfect timing that my birthday falls on his day off this year.

So people of Reddit

**EDIT: {semi-update}** I just talked to one of his friends (who is also a friend to me) who is also going. I asked him to get some details about how all this went down.

----

Deep breath...okay. Throwaway account here. I have been married to my wife for 8.5 years now and we've definitely had our ups and downs. There were times I thought she may be cheating on me but I never had enough evidence to prove it. Then, etc.

Lately we've had one of those down times. We have to kids (2 and 4) and are in a financial mess at the moment (credit card debt, twice a week or more. She also said she doesn't want to have sex because she's so depressed. Once again, I was concerned she may be cheating on me but had no evidence. Sunday night I looked her in the eye and asked her, ""Are you cheating on me?"" Her reply, looking me in the eye, was ""no, that's not even an issue."" I left it at that but wasn't convinced. I have noticed a few texts from random guys that I considered she may be sleeping with, last week

Then, as were a number of her relatives that work for the same company. After the party she slept at her uncle's house for a few hours (again, verifiable) and came home early in the morning. After she got home and had slept for a bit, she asked me to get her cell phone for her. I unplugged it from the charger and saw there was a text from that morning from a name I vaguely recognized. I didn't mention it but put a lot of thought into who it might be. Then I remembered it was the name of the guy she lost her virginity to 17 years ago, and realized that she had probably texted him while reminiscing about the first time they had sex, which happened to be in that same bed at her uncle's house. It was then I decided I needed to figure out her phone password.

Last night she went to the gym after work and said she did a spin class and weights afterward. I didn't think too much of it because she has been working out pretty hard lately; she likes to stay fit anyway but it's now obvious why she's working out extra hard. This morning I saw her phone laying on the dining room table and thought I'd give it a shot, however, a conversation with a co-worker of hers. That conversation sent my head spinning, hands shaking, and made my knees bend with weakness. While I was pretty sure I was being played, I now had proof. The conversation (paraphrased) was pretty much ""I haven't had great sex in a long time...I'll come over after spin class"", him saying his live-in girlfriend wouldn't be home until 9, I'm not sure they've slept together before but it doesn't matter. Even if they haven't I know this isn't the first time she's cheated on me.

So, I will not leave my kids. They are the most important victims of this whole thing and I don't want to lose custody of them. Seriously, I'm not planning to use them as bait, I just really won't give them up. If anyone leaves, it should be her. Of course, this is complicated by the fact that her sibling lives with us, but I don't really feel like adding to many more identifiable details to this post. Sorry this post is long (and possibly nothing new) but I have a lot on my mind and don't really know what I should do. Should I confront her tonight? Please help!

A lot of your advice (and I did read and ponder every word) swirled in the back of my head constantly, that I was a wuss for taking it, that we had no chance -- I hated the pessimistic reality of it all and I wanted it to be wrong. I wanted to keep faith in us. After two more nights of coming home to her doing the same thing again (and me trying to gently get her to stop with several ""hey""s, waving my hand in front of her face, and even whistling to no avail), I finally faced how much I was lying to myself about the true severity of the communication rift between us and how much we lacked the ability to connect on a level that the most basic relationship should have. And I went to sleep in a separate room (I couldn't handle ""lying"" any longer by sleeping in the same bed as her as if nothing was happening) feeling physically sick. 

The third night is when I finally got her attention. I didn't yell at her, I didn't join in with her. I just stood next to her and started reading her a letter which I had taken the time to prepare off and on throughout my work day. Her usually angered expression looked like it actually started to turn sad (maybe even regretful?) as I told her I loved her, and cared for her, and wanted nothing more than for us to work. I even included a poem that her and I had made together about our relationship during better times. She never stopped moving her hands and staring forward as I read, but I did notice tears start to come from her eyes and I started to get teary too. When my letter concluded, I asked her if she wanted to finally stop and she responded by screaming and turning up the volume of the porn, so I took that as her needing time to herself and left.

The next night, but this was a huge improvement that I can only imagine getting better as time goes on. Reddit, I think this problem was solved and I could not have done it without you. Thank you so much for your advice and willingness to help to the fullest. You have helped strengthen my relationship with this wonderful girl and I can't imagine life in a more beautiful way.

1351878087.0,12iv4a,"I [34/m] found out my wife [f/32] was sexting another man.  I don’t want to get a divorce, but I think we have to.  ",ta_realtionship,120,25,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/12iv4a/i_34m_found_out_my_wife_f32_was_sexting_another/

My wife and I have been together for a long time.  I am 34 and she is 32.  We have been married for about 7 years, nice cars.  She is the only person I have had sex with and our sex life is very good.  I have also always been there for her emotionally.  All in all, our lives are pretty good.  

For her she was a stay at home mom.  One of our kids is in 1st grade and the other is in their second year of preschool.   I know she was bored staying at home and although I have made several attempts to remedy this, and I think she did, but in an unfortunate way. 

A few weeks ago, in a single month there were over 800 texts back and forth.  I also noticed that there were many photo exchanges between the two.  I only had specific phone number details for the past 90 days, but it looks like this was going on for a while.  

I confronted her about this and after several days of her flat out lying, but I literally got sick over this, I even threw up. 

We are now about three weeks later.  I officially separated from her and I moved into an extra room in the basement.  Over the past few weeks I think I did the right thing. I tried to stay calm and think things through logically.  I decided to setup a time at night after the kids went to sleep to talk through everything.  I asked her every question I could think of.  At first she was still lying about things

I have been somewhat obsessed over this.  I have made calendars of the days they texted

After asking lots of questions and over several discussions

Now, I don't think I can only see them every other weekend. I know we have the option of split custody, but I really don't want to do this to them.  She knows she royally screwed up and she has also expressed a significant amount of remorse.  She said she absolutely doesn't want a divorce and she has said she still loves me.  

However, sending photos happened about 8 times and there were many photos sent.  I also don't trust her anymore, I feel like she is sugar coating things and I am not getting the whole story.  I am also very concerned that she may have done something in the past that she is not telling me about.  Lots of things are going through my head. 

Basically the logical part of my brain is saying I have to get a divorce.  Many of my emotions are also saying this.  Sometimes I am absolutely certain I want a divorce.  However, I want to work things out.  I feel completely bi-polar right now. 

A few days ago I told her that yes we are going to get a divorce

Also, I need a case number so my lawyer can get a backup of the texts from our cell carrier.  I am hoping once I have the texts I can get the complete picture.  

So, but a divorce is going to make the kids suffer and all of our lives are going to go into complete chaos.   This is a very tough decision.  


EDIT: Thank you everyone for your advice.  I may have mentioned that my wife and I try to talk every night.  We talked tonight as well

EDIT (2012-11-04 @ 1:00 PM ET).  Again, I had asked if she was sending someone naked pictures and she said no.  Then a little later that day I mentioned that I would hate to divorce her if she was doing that, but that was more of a passing comment.  But for her this should have been a very sobering moment that she was about to destroy everything.  Instead of stopping, she still continued doing this. ",,False,,1352052515.0,t3_12iv4a

Thanks RA for all the past advice


We're just begun marriage counselling and in her first comment to the therapist my wife shared that she hasn't felt any sexual desire for me in the past 7 or 8 years (her words exactly). It broke my heart to read this as we were married 4 years ago and now have 3 children. (Do you know how much fucking is required to get 3 children?) It makes me very sad to think that she faked all that passion.


For me this means that she married me without desiring me sexually and makes me feel that I am being used to support her desires to have children/habitation/bon bons/etc...


I have not yet shared my feelings on this with her


Regardless; I am committed to doing anything to repairing our relationship and am currently doing the one man cleaning army/scrub sponge things as well as spending all my free time with the children to give her a break. Know how she feels makes me think that these things are useless. I am more depressed than ever.

I read this quote somewhere when I was in the midst of struggling with a relationship. I had been seeing a girl that I found myself becoming strongly attracted to, she made it clear that she wanted no sort of relationship, and at the same time was very aware that I strongly wanted a relationship. We did all the things bf/gf's do, including physical intimacy, texting each other all day, talking, hanging out, etc. A couple times I pressed her to make it official

I posted here for advice

But it wasn't easy to try to put this into practice. Being such a small town

Finally, and she took the initiative and asked me out! 

That's what it took... suddenly it all made sense. I had been pining for a girl who only wanted me around when it was convenient for her. She was aware of my desire to make it something more, so to speak, even though her stance on relationships was always in the back of my mind.

But finally, but it will never work. The idea is to find someone who wants to be in your company just as much as you want to be in theirs. That's how it's supposed to be!

**tl;dr** - Tried to make something happen with a girl who made it clear she wasn't in for it. Took a date with another nice girl to make me realize I needed to get out of the thing with girl 1.

""Don't make someone a priority in your life when you're only an option in theirs."" Words to live by.

**I post this not to ask for advice

**Edit1:** I should have elaborated on the ""leading on"" part. It's true that she was always up front that she did not want a relationship ""at this time."" But she often said things along the lines of ""some day"" and ""when I'm ready for a relationship"" and led me to believe that if I hang around long enough

**Edit2:** One thing I wanted to add. This whole situation taught me that I view human relationships in a completely different way than girl number 1 in this story. To me, are physically attracted to, and find some beginnings of what could be a lasting relationship, you jump at the chance! Those things don't come along every day, especially in a small town when you don't have the opportunity to meet dozens of new people every day! I don't care what's going on in my life, if I meet a girl like this, I'm going to make every effort to see it through and see what happens. To me,,True,t3_dljv7

I've always been kind of an outsider in this group.  I met them in college, and I virtually never speak ill others. I have a suspicion that perhaps somebody spread rumors about me in college and that image has kind of stuck with me since.  I feel like maybe one person didn't like me at point, and that person talked to others and soon enough I was known as 'that guy'.  To give you an idea, many of my friends are Asian.  In asian communities, once you have a 'reputation' or sorts, it's hard to get rid of.  I have a policy never to speak ill of people behind their backs, so in a social setting I would definitely be more vulnerable than the average person.

I am ashamed to admit it, and I'm not sure if it would even be worth it as I'm now a grown ass man anyway, and almost reaching that age where friends are kind of unneeded any way.

Now, a lot of people neglect opportunities for social interaction, dating, etc., because they're fixated maintaining tight contact with people they already know who are nowhere near them anymore.

Case in point: the girl I posted about in another thread has a LDR (3 years) with a guy 6 hours away.  His job is not going to allow much flexibility in the way of where he lives

What kind of potential is there in a relationship where neither person has much say over where they end up (him less than her), and he's not changing careers.

In the years before Facebook and texting, these kinds of relationships (and I'm not criticizing hers, it's just an example) lumber on well past their expiration date, with people unwilling or unable to move on.

I did not give him any specifics because I realized the phone call was a mistake, or time to have this conversation and remained calm but he knew. He did not own it, he did play dumb on the phone.  Without me asking or mentioning, he immediately packed up everything and got on the next flight home.

Hi

My boyfriend (22M) and I (20F) have been dating for a little over a year and a half. We met on a dating site and the relationship just took off. We pretty much agree that we're as close to ""soulmates"" as two people can get. Our relationship is very close and we hardly ever fight (until now, and him even less, but the situations it was said in and the scarcity of it being said makes it all the more meaningful to me. He has quite a few mental/emotional issues, and I'm a pretty level-headed, sane gal. We're best friends, partners in crime, and usually our sex life is pretty good too. 

We've had a couple of problems before, maybe a little less than a month. He left the country for three weeks and we broke up the week before, but practically nothing about our behavior as a couple changed in that week before he left. We were spending just as much time together, having just as much sex, doing just as many couple things. After he left I decided I had best get over him because we were done for good, we had just spent the last week before he left together for ""old time's sake"" and to end on good terms. 

He tried to contact me a few times while he was overseas, he missed me so much, he had some conversations with the people he was staying with that made him realize that I was right about everything and I was perfect for him and he loved me and he wanted to be back with me and move in with me and all this other stuff. He was more open and affectionate than he ever had been before. I was really happy...... I had been pretty sad since we had broken up and I didn't really think he wanted a future with me. I was worried that he was just homesick and sad and was saying things he didn't really mean, but we talked out that concern. This was about a month ago... he came home just before the end of June.

Things have been awesome since he came back. He's been so sweet and affectionate. He even said ""I love you, which he had never done before. We were just spooning in bed and he said it. I teared up a little, I will admit.

About two weeks ago I got a message on some old obscure social networking site that I don't even use anymore from someone saying she needed to tell me something and asking if I knew a guy named (boyfriend's name.) I said yes, exchanging dirty pictures and sexting and stuff, and that he said he was single. She said he gave her his phone number and invited him over. (it's worth mentioning that she went WAY, WAY out of her way to find me on this obscure website and contact me.) I'm a pretty non-confrontational person but I was PISSED, so angry and upset I was shaking. I sent him a pretty stern text demanding that he explain himself. He owned up to it right away, never tried to deny it. He came over later that night to talk about it and my god, when he walked up to my front door he just had the saddest and most pathetic look on his face. I'm too empathetic of a person, but I don't fucking engage with these guys) and that since I'm really the only friend he has and the only person he sees or talks to on a regular basis (also true) it makes him feel lonely and he doesn't really know how to make friends so he feels like sexual attraction is the only way he can connect with other people. He said he never intended to meet her and was just manipulating her for sexy pictures and attention.

 Okay, hurt, upset, humiliated, and in general felt like absolute shit. My gut, and most of my friends, said dump his ass right now but I was hesitant because jesus, and I'm not the most assertive person in the first place, and he said he didn't know.

Fast forward to last Friday (weird sentence.) I receive ANOTHER message from this girl with a copy-pasta'ed message that he sent her basically saying that he was sorry, and that he ""absolutely swears he wasn't just using her for naked pictures and sex "" (SEX? what's this now?) and that he ""just didn't want to miss his chance to get to know her because it was the first time in his life something felt like destiny"" and blah blah blahhhhhhh and in general saying all this weird desperate shit that didn't sound like him at all. 

WHAT THE FUCK!?R2EGBQ13UQWEJSD I flipped out. I was so mad. I couldn't believe him. I sent him quite a few angry, I want to be better,"" ............. BETTER DO IT AGAIN, only this time even WORSE! He was blatantly, shamelessly lying to both of us and honestly I was waaaaaaaay more hurt by the things he said in the second message than I was by the fact that he was exchanging dirty pictures and sexting.

We talked about it. A lot. He agreed that it was absolutely fucking retarded and said that he wasn't really thinking when he sent the second message. He didn't really have any excuse or reasoning for that shit.

But during our conversation something came out, and he will only do missionary or me on top. Nothing else. At all. Ever. I don't mind because I'm pretty easy to please, sex isn't hugely important to me in a relationship as long as we're having it and we're both enjoying it. And he never even indicated before this that he wasn't enjoying sex with me :(

My gut reaction to this is to feel horribly sexually inadequate. What is wrong with me? What's so repulsive about me that makes him want to have sex with other people? He keeps saying there's nothing wrong with me

But I'm not okay with him having sex with other girls while he's with me, I am going to break up with you and probably not speak to you or see you for a little while so I can get over all this shit. You can't stay in a relationship with me AND have sex with other girls because I am not okay with you having sex with other girls. His reaction to this is that it's HORRIBLY unfair and why does he have to choose and why can't I just be okay with him having sex with other girls. I told him ""basically you just want to have your cake and eat it too. You can't do that,"" and he said ""why not?""

On Sunday I told him I was going to break up with him and he had better come over so we could talk about it in person. We talked about all the things I just mentioned for quite a while, it's cheating,) and when I offer him the get out of jail free card of me breaking up with him, he STILL desperately tries to hold on. He wants to have two mutually exclusive things at the same time and thinks it's unfair that he can't. 

SO. I know I should dump his ass, etc. I know that's what you all are going to tell me to do and that's probably what I'm going to do eventually because at this point there's no way I can trust him again ever, he doesn't deserve another chance, every time I think of what he said to that other girl I feel sick. I guess maybe I just need a kick in the ass from you guys and/or advice on how to do it since..... when I tried he started crying and bear-hugged me. It's hard to be angry at someone you love when they're doing that, no matter how angry you were before. OR, alternatively/in addition to breaking up with him, how on earth can I make him understand that he can't freaking be in a relationship with me and have sex with other people BECAUSE I'm not okay with it, that's just how life fucking is?

Thanks a lot if you read this far

1262216561.0,ak2cc,Too ugly for any kind of relationship...,cesterrible,108,15,78,"EDIT: Thank you all for your comments.  I am not trying to ignore anyone with my lack of replies-- I am just thinking about what has been said.

**TL;DR: I am a 24-year-old woman so ugly I get ignored by a lot of people, and I try to be nice.  Is there a way I can get people to interact with me?**

Basically I think I may be too ugly to easily make friends, don't have bad acne, don't have any physical deformities.  But I look in the mirror and my face is just so plain and different from everyone else's.  I was teased for being ugly since high school and I don't know anyone else who was teased just based on what they looked like.  I thought maybe it was just these few people in high school, but then it happened in college too.  I was at a sophomore dormitory seminar once on body image (lol) and the RA talking at the front of the group said something like, ""Not everyone is born a model.."" and the girl sitting next to me nudged her friend and pointed at me, then they both laughed.  I guess they forgot I have peripheral vision.

In high school I was fat as well, 5'7"" and about 140lbs.  I was wrong about the thinness thing.  It didn't help.  In fact probably the worst part was that my shoulders (which are kind of broad to begin with) got a little more muscular, and my boobs shrunk..though I don't have flat/nonexistent boobs either.  I have always kept myself clean and I wear my hair long in a ""feminine"" cut.  I try to dress neatly and not in anything weird.  Sometimes I wear fingernail polish because I hope someone notices that I'm putting out the effort.

In high school I had plenty of friends.  In fact I'd go so far as to say I was the leader in my little pack of buddies.  I got along well even with people who were not my friends

But the second I left for the weekend freshmen orientation I knew I was in trouble.  I couldn't find someone who wanted to be my roommate.  I couldn't find anyone who wanted to hang out with me.  Most of the time I felt like I was invisible, about 1500 undergrads.  My roommate left school over winter break-- she had never told me or the RA.  I got a couple of friends in my sophomore year, but one of them dropped out and then I dropped out at the end of my junior year.

I went back to college at a larger school the following semester.  I finally found someone who actually sought me out in one class and wanted to talk with me

So I finished my undergrad degree and lost touch with those two immediately afterward.  Now I am a grad student and I'm doing well enough in that.  I participate in a few extracurricular activities hoping to meet new people.  But at best I have a few acquaintances from my work and my research.  No one has ever invited me to a party.  Last semester a couple people actually invited me to get Chinese food after a day at the lab

I can't help but think my appearance is the causal factor here.  I have always tried to be cordial to people, i.e. I don't stare or talk *too* much.  I don't have problems being among large groups of people, or speaking to them (I would have a lot of trouble with grad school if that was true!).  My grades are fine, I still exercise so I feel physically okay.  I don't think my few acquaintances are aware I have no friends.

But I think the way I look just frightens people away

If no one can think of anything I haven't thought of already that's okay too.  It does feel nice just to type this out...which is probably why it's so long.",,t5_2r0cn,True,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/ak2cc/too_ugly_for_any_kind_of_relationship/

I just got out of a three year relationship. It was awful
Fast forward to last weekend. My friends had been begging me to go out with them every night, and my friends kept urging me to give him my number. After a few hours of flirting, I decided to leave him my number on a napkin.
We went on one date, walked around downtown. Had a great time, we were brutally honest with each other about everything going on in our lives and honestly tried to help each other. At this point he tells me that he is known for being an asshole. (MY FIRST RED FLAG, WHODU THUNK IT) At the end of the night we slept together, and then I went home.


I thought I had just experienced my first one-night-stand
But then he kept texting me and saying how much he wanted to go on another date with me


Here’s where it gets awful. 


As soon as I get there, not a few buddies, three people. But that will play in later. 
His ex calls him after I’ve been there for about 20 mins, grabbing at my legs. At this point I’m getting pissed off, but I don’t know any better and I stay around. 
After he hangs up the buddy decides he wants to go to the pool. I don’t have a swimsuit, cell phone, cigarettes and all. 
I get out of the water pissed as hell, but I was too drunk to drive at the moment so we started to watch the hockey game.
Well, anyone?) Trying to get me to touch it, trying to get me to look at it, ect. IN FRONT OF HIS FRIEND. 
I got super offended and left to go to the bathroom. Mind you


I get super flustered and use the excuse “your friend is still here.” 
So the only logical thing is to INVITE HIS FRIEND IN to try and convince me to have a three-some. TOTALLY. 
His friend feels awkward and eventually just fucking leaves because he’s tired of seeing the guy’s dick. On the way out he tells his friend that “he needs to stop and clearly she’s not into it.” 
When I finally realize that the other guy is gone, but it’s not like it was his job or anything. 
So when I’m peaking in a guest bedroom looking for the friend
This mother fucker took a picture of me. 
I left then in a rage



All the next day the dude was texting me



Here’s where I need your help. I think I want to agree to go on one more date, Reddit, hell no. 

Help me

TL;DR went on two dates

So we are completely through and she pretty much hates me. I don't think there was much I really could have done to change it. Here's what happened:

We had talked about what we could do and none of the options looked too appealing. While I was in Toronto

So, etc.). So I made plans with my friend to drive down on a Friday, snowboard on Saturday and then come back to Toronto. She said we could stay at the apartment.

We arrive at 8pm on Friday and something is obviously wrong. I go for a walk with her and we talked about it. She told me that she was extremely angry at me for doing this all during the holiday season and so close to her birthday. She said she doesn't know if she can ever trust me again that I wouldn't just run off on her. I said that I can understand where she was coming from and asked what she wanted to do. She said that she now doesn't want to commute, just speak english to us. We don't like speaking French"". She was absolutely unwilling to even compromise. I would've put them in French schools and taken regular vacations to Quebec (even would've bought a cottage there!). But no, she was 100% unwilling to consider this. *So*, basically her compromise was that there was no compromise. She was never willing to even consider moving to Toronto or Ontario. She hates this province and English. It was so apparent. I found is extremely offensive when she said that we have no culture. I never knew how ingrained Quebecois and Separatism were in her.

So

So

I'm sad. I wish we could've ended it better and I told her this. I told her I still loved her and she'll always have a place in my heart. It's just sad that we will never be able to live in the same place. I'm not happy as a person in Montreal

I feel I made the right decision by taking all my things that night. Previously she had taken my keys and threatened to kick me out and that she would ship all my things back to me and her convenience. I couldn't have let that happen. This was my only chance. She said I ran away like a coward and a thief but I was *not* going to trust her with basically every possession I have (a lot are irreplaceable)

Anyways

We had plans for today (this morning actually) that we talked about for a while. We were both excited and looking forward to it. But her friend was having a going away bar crawl type of thing, reminding her not to get too drunk and that I still wanted to get an early start.

She called me at about 12:30. She needed a ride because she didn't want to stay at a friend's house. I was asleep, she's *wasted*. Reeks of alcohol. Slurring her words. Stumbling around. Everything.

There was plenty of nudity and marital/relationship issues brought up in the movie. The second movie was ""Friends with Benefits"". During the intermission the argument began. The girlfriend began telling me that every movie I pick out has nudity and it makes her uncomfortable. I felt like I was being blamed for making the movie. 

She wont choose what we watch so I choose movies I think will be funny and geared the to the mid 20's crowd. She referenced every recent comedy with a nude woman in it and blamed me for picking them. She made it seem like I have a problem and always intentionally pick movies with nude woman in it.

I don't know if I can ask for advice...but I don't know if there is nudity in movies. Im seriously considering watching every movie prior to letting her see them like shes an 11 year old.

It isn't just movies though either. She hates the idea of porn (which I don't watch) and if i say the word bachelor party she freaks out. She thinks I cant live without a strip club in my life. I don't even like strip clubs! I went ot a bachelor party a month ago and waited outside while everyone else went into the club. I felt like a douche but she appreciated it. Believe me

Why does she get mad at me though

I just want to watch funny new movies that the rest of society thinks are hilarious

We left during intermission because I was afraid that the ""friends with benefits"" movie would have nudity. I don't know if it does....but I know I sure would have gotten in trouble if it did. I wish I coulda stayed. I know i did the right thing by leaving but i like Mila Kunis.

First, because she's gone through something terrible and I don't blame her for it.  I kept pressing the fact that all I wanted to do was make the two of us happier.  I then explained, delicately, how difficult it was to communicate with her, and how much I missed talking and having sex.  She responded by bursting into tears and saying she was fully aware of how she was treating me, but I had been so patient that it never occurred to her that she needed to change her behavior.  (Basically I was being an enabler by allowing her to treat me this way, and it put the idea in her subconscious that her actions were okay.)  She realized that the entire year had been spent taking care of herself, so now needed to start repairing her relationships.  I was so relieved;  this was not at all the reaction I had expected.  I hugged her and kissed her and told her how much I loved her.  I felt the happiest and saddest I had felt for a long time.

I then met with her private therapist and discussed alternative treatments for PTSD, then she would try the other treatments.  Of course I realize there might be some ways in which she won't be exactly the same, but she is so strong and so motivated and cares about ""us"" so much, that I'm willing to put in the effort to make this work.

It's only a couple weeks later, she is now much better about taking a deep breath and thinking about what to say;  sometimes she still lashes out, but always catches herself, apologizes ONE time, and initiates a rational reaction.  I'm also starting to speak up for myself more, since she is in a position to listen better.  She's starting to seem more and more like her old self, she's repairing other friendships that had been damaged because of the assault, best of all, and she was safe.

About 2 weeks ago, how she gets along with some and not so well with others, the usual ""how-was-your-day"" talk. I've never been the jealous type and always offered her complete freedom and never questioned her trust, even though her co-workers are mostly guys. We actually mock the boyfriends who are overprotective of their girlfriends and don't allow them to do something or get upset even if she would be talking to some other guy. 

Well, how well they get along, what great talks they have etc and I am genuinely happy for her that she finally has someone to talk to and make the day easier on her. So, I make nothing of it, and things go great while she keeps telling me how great that guy is. To be honest, I got a little jealous (who wouldn't?) but I didn't let it show and I was angry on myself for feeling jealous, afteral

Then 2 days ago, to chit-chat in her break, and she tells me that she just came back from a walk in the park with a girl-colleague of her, I say ""cool"" and she says ""oh, and also the new guy came with us"". I got a little suspicious here, not because he went along with them, but because she mentioned him coming with them at the last moment

So, as I always do, but I forget my phone to call her when to come out. I swear, and I know it might not be believable, but I actually forgot my phone. 

So, sitting in this guy's lap with her arms around his neck and his hands around her. If I didn't know any better I would say they are definitely together. She jumps up from the chair and from his lap and with this scared look on her face and shaky voice tells me ""why didn't you call?"". I tell her I forgot my phone and that I'll be waiting outside. 

At this point my heart is racing and I'm furious, her arms crossed around my neck, and ask myself if I would do that, if I would consider it out of line, and the answer comes easily to me: No, I would never hold another girl like that while I have a girlfriend. 

So, and I calmly explain to her that what she did was out of line and that I feel betrayed and that we should take a break.

So, did I over analyze the whole thing, am I in the wrong, is it just the jealousy in me talking?

My wife and I have been married for just over a year now. We've been together for almost 5 years. We have a child together

**The Story:**

She went to visit her family out of state over New Years. I wasn't able to go due to other obligations, then decided she wanted to spend the rest of her life with him (how someone makes this decision over the matter of a day or two, I don't know). She decided she was going to get a divorce, and move back with him. 

She was acting weird when she got home and I knew something was up, she agreed to give it a serious try to work things out before making any decisions that will affect the rest of our lives. 

I know some of you are going to think that I should just let her go and all (and in some ways, nor do I want to sell our house to split our assets. I know that chances are, she would get custody, and I am the primary income for our family, so I don't think she could give our kid a good life. There are a lot of other reasons that I want it to work, but the main one is that I really do love my family and don't want to see it ripped apart.

**The Problem:**

So, and give it a real try, so maybe everything will work out. Well, I found out that she's still texting the guy nonstop. I told her that she shouldn't talk to him like she is if she really wants to work things out. Her response was ""We're friends, so I still want to talk to him."" My thoughts are that she slept with this guy, so if she wants to work it out with me, she needs to choose between our relationship or their friendship. Is that a bad request? Is it wrong of me to make this request

I love her, is out of line if she's serious about working it out. If it wasn't for my kid, I would probably just cut her loose at this point and watch her fall. She makes $10 an hour at her job, has had 7 or 8 different jobs in the last 3 years, and has no real skills other than being outgoing. The guy is in the same situation, except with even fewer skills. I, on the other hand

TL;DR My wife and I are going to try to work things out after she cheated. Is it wrong that I ask that she end her friendship with the guy she cheated with


**Edit**
Thanks everyone for the comments. I tried to respond to most of them

I had already spoken to a lawyer before this post was made. The lawyer recommended counseling, but with our kid involved, and on the lawyer's advice, we are going to try counseling. Our counseling doesn't start for another week though.

As far as alimony

The biggest issue would be custody/child support. The easiest way for me to get primary or full custody is if she left the state (with or without our child). Otherwise, as child support is meant to cover that. Unfortunately for me, our state is also a big proponent of the Tender Years laws.

And I do agree with CursedBeIron. She didn't wanted to admit that she enjoyed it, but I guess I will find out later. As for us

Hey guys, I owe ya'll for the advice. :)

So Link and I have been going steady for about 2 weeks now. Everything has been awesome. I've been having some tough school stuff because of finals

An example would be the other day when I was freaking out about an exam. I was at school early and texted him at like 7am to see if he was awake/could come visit me at my study spot (he lives on campus). He showed up 5mins later in his pajamas and a hoody and we just sat there with his arms around me while I teared up on his hoody and he told me I'd do fine. I did fine! For someone who's never been in a relationship

In regards to his best friend girl person, we all went to the bar the weekend she broke up with her long distance bf and towards the beginning of the night she ""accidently"" spilt her drink all over my dress. She was all giggly and apologetic about it, but the way it happened in my opinion was no accident. No worries though, the night was young so I jumped in my car and grabbed another outfit. 

Other than this, but pretty much it all goes down to me getting to know her, and finding her to be a *MASSIVE ATTENTION WHORE* so I think she's just butthurt about losing a large percentage of that from my now boyfriend. 

I haven't bothered Link with any of her more recent actions since I can totally handle myself and it's really not affecting our relationship. I'm sure she's a good person at heart going through a tough time right now

[Source](http://www.askmehelpdesk.com/relationships/no-contact-rule-46556.html)

Here is something I have found about the no contact rule. I hope it helps others as much as me. 

So, you take the step of implementing this ‘No Contact’ (NC) that we advocate widely on the forum.

So what’s it about then? And what is going to happen?

Hopefully

While a seemingly simple question

1) You tell your ex that you won’t be contacting them and that they shouldn’t contact you.
2) You don’t tell your ex anything
3) You don’t tell your ex anything

In my opinion

When starting NC

You also may want to tell the ex why your cutting them out of your life – tell them it is so you can heal and move on. And in reality that IS why you’re doing it……


Why implement No Contact?

First and foremost, the benefits far outweigh the initial emotional turmoil.
No Contact allows you to get back on your feet and start to feel confident in who you are again. Remember a time when you were single and happy? Well No Contact is going to put you on the road to getting back to that point.
Some may be reluctant to take steps to regain independence

No Contact can also serve another purpose
And that is of course



Will No Contact bring my ex back?

Perhaps

There has to be some desire to reconcile inside your ex – NC will not create that desire



Will my ex miss me? 

To be honest
So
For those who have exes that want to remain friends: Why do you think that is?
It’s because they want you in their life. Exes very rarely stay friends…so in effect
They are not ready to let you go (yet)
Without NC you can be certain that once your ex is back on their feet emotionally (helped there by you)
No Contact is a far better option than staying friends. Being friends causes you pain and allows your ex to heal quicker. NC causes your ex pain and allows you to heal quicker 

Not exactly rocket science

When should I implement No Contact? 

ASAP but you must be certain that you can stay strong and stick to it. NC isn’t a decision that should be reversed until you are completely healed. If you keep implementing NC and then breaking it

That’s why NC should not be used as a ‘shock tactic’ – don’t expect to implement NC and for your ex to come running back to you in a week or even a month. If you use NC




Will No Contact push my ex away? 

If there is hope for your relationship
After a few weeks of NC
If that’s the way you’re thinking
It says to your ex “I implemented NC to move on and heal…and now 3 weeks down the track I haven’t moved on or healed at all.” 
The ex will again know that they can still have you if they want you…and even if they don’t hear from you for another few weeks
Not a bad little (HUGE) security boost for the ex there


How long will I keep hurting? 

For as long as you allow yourself to. Remember
It is perfectly normal to miss your ex
Go out

Thinking about the good times is pointless – there is no possibility of having them back at the moment

Ideally, not thinking about them will become normal.


What if the ex breaks NC and calls/emails me?

Two options: Respond or don’t respond.

If you have completely given up hope or don’t wish to reconcile with your ex – ignore the contact and keep ignoring any further attempts at contact. Easy.

If you are seeking reconciliation
If they are calling for a ‘catch up’, and make it clear to your ex that NC isn’t just a whim….you are serious about it. Remind them, if it comes up, that friendship is not an option.

Make it clear that you are respecting their decision to end the relationship
If you are seeking reconciliation


Tips

Remove any photos and reminders you have of your ex from your life. Put them in a box and pack them away. You don’t need things like that preventing you from moving on.

Copy down your ex’s email address and phone numbers on a piece of paper

If you are strong enough to delete their contact details without writing them down

Stop talking about your ex with your friends. They’ll get sick of it

**TL;DR** : Followed some advice from reddit and tried to communicate my problems to my fiancee.  This led to a sexual breakthrough and now I feel more excited about our relationship and our sex life than ever.  

First and foremost I want to thank everyone who tried to help with some advice in my previous post (I also cross posted to /r/deadbedrooms and advice there was useful as well).  A lot of it was hard for me and I may have felt on the defensive

Last night, and I learned a lot of things and was able to convey my point of view more clearly than before.  

It turns out there was a lot going on.  She was mad at me in general.  She was withholding sexual affection because she didn't think I was being affectionate enough.  She was self conscious about her body because she wasn't getting enough positive feedback from me.  She was intentionally taking all my ""effort"" in bed without reciprocation.  She didn't think I wanted her to do more

She had a hard time explaining this all at first.  And I recognized some of the things she was feeling were my fault as well

She apologized to me for all the things which were bothering me and I promised to work on the other things for her sake as well.  We felt pretty close then but she didn't want to do anything that night

Instead I suggested we talk about what we each want sexually - essentially baby steps.  I told her I wouldn't judge her for any fantasy / fetish stuff that she might want to do because I had my own and some of them were pretty crazy.  She explained to me what she wanted to do

Since I mentioned mine and said I had others she begged me to share.  So I shared one more and mentioned the mojoupgrade quiz that's linked over at /r/sex

As it turns out

And despite her saying she didn't want to earlier, depressed and at times physically ill.  Today I feel kind of like I won the lottery and my hands are shaking in anticipation.

1364188325.0,1ayiam,Wife (30/f) has a new guy friend...and I'm [30/m] going out of my mind,tablarg,113,23,259,"Wife and I have been married for 3 years

A new friend, in a different department but same location, same floor. He works a later shift and generally arrives to work as she's finishing up her day. They spend the first hour of his shift chatting while she finished up her day. He's ""very cool to talk to"" (exact quote). Apparently John has worked there for over a year, however his name has only been mentioned recently.

A few weeks ago several of us went bar hopping, the night moves on, conversations rotate, people move on with their lives and everyone has fun. John drinks...a lot...quantities of American Light Lager (barf) that will surely loosen the strongest of colons. The group thins as the evening progresses and John, who now needs a babysitter, stops being fun.  He inches his chair closer to wife (who has stepped up to the duty of den mother), touching her arm when he slurs to her.  John sees some other people that he knows and runs off. I and another friend are ready to leave. We convince wife that John, will be fine. She finds John as we make our escape to say goodbye. As we travel home


I'm informed throughout the weeks between then and now that she gave John a ""talking to"" about being so drunk. They're friends again. yay. They chat every day after work. awesome.

Friday. Her work has an event after which everyone is going to a bar. I'm sick (stupid fluctuating weather) so instead of infecting the masses with my plague, John was invited to join (event was not for his department). Friends text and FB some pics to me throughout the evening, just the usual (wife is weird poses or caught making an odd face) nothing special (no John).

1:00am - no word from wife (did she get drunk and is staying with one of our friends? is she on her way home?) I check find-a-friend app (which wife and I use when we dont feel like sending ""where are you"" or when she sends the daily ""why haven't you left work yet"" texts). She's not far

1:45am - She moves

Saturday morning - I'm up before she is and re-thinking the 1am - 2am events. Now, ""I'm going to stay with {Close Friend}"", ""I'm on my way...if I don't make it send help"", ""Irm two drnk...com gert me"" any of the above would've been nice.

Sleeping Beauty awakens around noon. We exchange pleasantries

""What time did you leave the bar?""  ""1""  ""Oh, yea I guess it took an hour then"" {She takes coffee and walks away to check her email...I didn't realize conversation was over}

""So seriously, he was too drunk to drive."" ""And that took an hour?"" ""Well, he didn't want to leave his car there and {blah blah filler}. So he moved it across the street and we left"" ""Yea"" ""And we sat in front of his house and talked for a few minutes""

...

""A few minutes?"" ""Yea


""Ok, yea I guess we talked for a while then. WHAT? do you think I did something? NOTHING HAPPENED! I WOULDN'T DO ANYTHING!""

 
""Ok fine. {I leave to do some shopping}."" She sends a few messages reiterating that she wouldn't do anything

 
After a few hours of thinking by myself, and I find it completely inappropriate that she's ""sitting in the car talking in front of his house for an hour."" If roles were reversed she'd feel the same. She agrees, she'd be pissed to, but wants me to like John. ""What if we all hang out in the future?"" ""I have no interest in hanging out with John"".

We continue through the day in normalcy, she shakes her head and continues some work. I'm still pissed about the situation and steal a glance at her computer when she steps away...she's chatting with John.

We decide the spend the evening in take-out and an old movie. She spends the evening sporadically messaging with John.

She goes to bed...I'm fuming. I read messages. She tells him all day about how I'm pissed that they talked and he shouldn't take the blame it's her fault and she enjoys talking to him.

We meet up with friends Sunday morning for brunch. She sends and receives several texts throughout our time with said friends. When I'm near her and her phone

We spend the rest of the day side by side

Any advice?


**TL;DR;**

Wife has a new guy friend from work that I don't like. They spend several hours a day talking. ""He's cool as shit to talk to"". I was sick...skipped a bar night...wife drove new friend home and spent almost an hour sitting in the car in front of his house talking. After voicing my extreme displeasure

She has a huge group of girl friends whos shes extremely close with, so if she was ""working"" it makes no sense that she would not wish them a happy new year, And their texts would all be deleted.

Her story is that she was working with her manager and her boss isnt supposed to know her manager is employing her for private home health care in a town 20mins from her work. She is willing to have her boss call me to verify she did work but who knows if her boss will be telling the truth or not. Every other fact I presented to her about what I noticed she does not have a logical explanation for. We recently have had NO problems. 
However I do know that before she was ""called into work"" she had plans to attend a party bus to go downtown. I am not friends or remotely familiar with any of the people who would be on it. That is my main suspicion for her to lie.

Please give me some constructive ways to go about getting the truth.

Her response to me finding out was to become extremely protective of her communications with other people, so a month and a half later I read her conversations with him. I left for the gym very angrily afterward and she pieced together why immediately, telling me that she had only spoken over the past few days. This was a lie. She said once again that she would cut contact with him. Obviously, this did not happen. Again.


Unwilling to embrace my inner naiveté and in truth being a very paranoid, fear, anger, etc) but I did it and that cannot be changed. During this period their (daily!) conversations were almost entirely about these topics: that he still loved her and would only ever been happy if their relationship was as a couple, and that she loved him but did not want to be in that kind of relationship; him asking her to take pictures for his fetishes and her denying him coyly, but obliging him in sending “normal” pictures via snapchat; her desperately trying to convince him to visit her in Las Vegas, which is a state we do not live in; him telling her that if they met he would need to have sex with her


These conversations took up the bulk of her time outside of the house. She would leave for class or work


Simultaneously, I just didn’t care about things very much. I became very fatalistic about our relationship. I stopped trying to “be better”, if that makes sense. I thought this might add some additional context, but who knows. I don’t consider it an excuse on my end. I read my girlfriends' private conversations for five months. I became insular and bitter. That’s wrong, and I accept it.


The final straw was Friday, so suffice to say this did not go well. She stared blankly while I explained what I had done and that I had read everything. She left after a weak apology and after crying a bit. She came home, went to sleep. Left in the morning. Came home, took a nap. Did not speak to me afterward. I couldn’t take it any more and confronted her again. Her stance is that what she did was not cheating, and that while elements of this relationship were inappropriate (exact words, there), I am overreacting and should be able to see that she values her relationship with me more than him. She says that she will stop talking to him. Again. For the third time. All of our conversations since have consisted of her defending this relationship


I think that it was cheating. I am hurt, but I would like to know if my reaction here is wrong and if I am being too jealous or...something. Anything.

He's forgiven me and wants to move on-- I'm having a hell of a time forgiving myself. How can I accomplish this and begin to move on as he has?**

--------

First

Yeah, but our subreddit interests are somewhat different that I didn't expect him to look at RA or R.

He hugged me and gave me a big smile. Mostly, rather I was looking for help as to how to take it on. And that meant a lot to him. As of then, I never wanted to look back again. It wasn't easy, but I achieved it: I forgave myself and am moving on. 

So I began talking. About my feelings, it's boosted his confidence and performance at work and, ah, well-- other areas.

In turn, it certainly has us butting heads-- because my confidence is growing, too. 

I began with dressing myself up a bit everyday, then it kinda grew from there. 

Since our confidences have shot up for both of us, and now I stand up for myself. A large amount of the issues that have plagued us from the very beginning of our relationship have been talked about and resolved. We're also beginning to speak in each other's language of love: his being touch/action, mine being talk/gifts. It's working out wonderfully. 

I'm currently looking for work in SF as I'm finish my paperwork for graduation: college is over, and it's great. 

To those who find themselves in a similar situation as I was: If you're truly sorry for your actions

But most importantly: truly learn from your mistakes

Because when you do

While I'm nowhere near an expert on relationships, and/or dealing with the consequences. I'm lucky as fuck to have a man who stayed. Even if yours doesn't, resolve the baggage: your next love doesn't deserve your sadness over another relationship. 
I hope this has helped. And thank you again. 

**Tl;dr: Forgave myself

--------

**EDIT:** I just wish to clarify that in no way, and active prevention against that is having a partner/friends to help check your blind spots and have open communication with your SO. At least, that's how it's been working out for me. These last few months since my last post have been like a large exhalation. I know hard times will come ahead, but right now, I'm certain that we'll be able to take on that challenge.

I'd like her to explain herself, I'd definitely need some proof, if she tells me it's just sexting. Can there even be such a thing? She's coming back in three days, should I wait or say something right nao?

Wife is 10 years younger - met when she was 21 &amp; have lived together for 5 years - tied the knot a month ago.

Rarely fight, friends/families both like each other.

The Heartbreak:

It seemed to be going so perfectly.  We live great together, so that I could make a better living and life together) and not enough time with her.  It killed me to hear because she's my everything and I've tried so hard to make more money so we could live a better life, but I told her if she wanted to call off the wedding, she should.  She didn't and we moved forward.  I opened myself up even more and even though we weren't there yet, considered myself as her husband (more romantic gestures, little love notes, planning dates--all the things I've always promised myself I'd do if I had a wife).  Two days before the wedding she did it again, and again even though it broke my heart, look after her things at home, I told her she was breaking my heart and described the pain I was in as she got more and more detached.  She then tells me that I'm an amazing person and everything a woman could want in a guy

The Now:

I told her I couldn't take the emotional distance--it is ripping me up inside--and she should leave.  I said she should pack a week's worth of clothes and go stay at a friend's and cut me out of her life so she could experience what life without me would be like.  No phone calls, absolutely no contact with me until she figures it out.  Once she gets her head clear, if she wants to go, she's free to be alone--It's the most painful suggestion I've ever put forward to someone who I love with all my heart.  And I can't talk to anyone about it!  Her dad thinks I'm great and has told her that she'll probably never find someone as good for her as me again, but he won't communicate with me (his loyalty is with her and that's understandable).  My parents are over-religious and only suggest a lot of prayer (it may work for them but I get nothing out of it).  Our friends adore us and I don't want them to gang up on her for hurting me.  I've never felt so alone.

The Questions:

Did I do the right thing?  Is there any hope she'll come back?

She says she was worried about money. She doesn't have a job where we're moving and she wanted to be comfortable (this is not very true; she has enough cash on hand to last a few months). She said she never wanted me to find out. She wanted to end this and then to bury it and start a new chapter. The email exchange I read was their back and forth after she had ended things between them.

Is it insane to move in right after this comes to light? Is it crazy to keep on with the relationship? Does anyone have advice on how to move past and act of dishonesty - but not of disloyalty?

Like I said, probably 30-40 lbs, and there are no signs it's slowing down. There is no mystery as to why, the girl never exercises. On top of that, she is always eating chocolate bars and candy and recently, over the last two months or so, she's decided she's going to have dessert with every dinner. I'm not exaggerating. Last week, on Tuesday she picked up a chocolate cake on her way home from work and had a slice of it after dinner that night

It's not even the weight that bothers me though. I'm still very much attracted to her and the sex is still amazing. What bothers me is that she doesn't even make an effort to be healthy. I am a very active person

I would love to be with this girl for a very long time, hiking, mountain climbing, and I want her to be able to do them with me for the rest of our lives. I don't want to worry about her getting arthritis or back problems or heart problems because if we end up together, I want it to be for as close to forever as we can manage.

I've tried inviting her on my morning runs and asking her if she'd like to come to the gym with me but she always makes up some excuse for not going. I've tried offering desserts that are less bad for you like fruit. I don't know how else to broach the subject. I brought this up to my parents

BUT THEN last month she did something crazy. Remember I said she broke up with her boyfriend a while back? And then all of you said she had deeper feelings for Link? Well *guess fucking what*... she **came out** about her feelings for him and tried seducing him while they were studying in her room one night (since they live across from eachother in dorms). She started like, I took him out for steak and.. a little treat when we got back to his place too that night, haha. 

So yup, and my favourite.. that she was just desperate and wanted what we had, realizing now what a great boyfriend he would be. He ended up blocking her number/deleting her facebook and all that and she eventually gave up. We see her now and then at friend group functions, but she knows to leave us alone and has stopped with the snarky comments.  

All in all things are super great! Kinda sad I didn't get to punch her in the face though. Ah well

At least a few times a day I hear her complain about being super horny and usually I'm busy at that moment with schoolwork or a conversation online or just in general occupied, she also complains that I never initiate sex either.

Its not that a conversation with a friend, or whatever activity I'm doing at that moment is more important than her. Its that I'm constantly getting badgered for sex so I'm desensitized to it.
At the risk of sounding disrespectful towards her, sex is a devalued commodity for me. Its constantly available and being asked of me so I'm not exactly running to meet it like I was when I was a teenager.

We don't really ever fight

The other night she was over at my apartment and we watched a movie. After the show was over we started kissing.

I'm really upset about this. I've never gotten along so well with a girlfriend before. Her parents think I'm awesome

When she's been drinking she's into physical stuff. But we haven't gone drinking together for a long time because she said she doesn't want all of our sexual experiences to be when shes drunk...

My girlfriend went away to a popular student destination with a lot of friends of hers

She asked me if I was alone and sitting down 'cause she had to tell me something; immediately I'm thinking 'oh shit what's happened, so I could tell she was scared and shaken about it. So I just stayed calm and asked 'were you raped?' to which she said after a moment's silence, 'yes.'

I was immediately in shock. What the fuck? I asked her how it had happened, she resisted and a struggle ensued. In the struggle her head was hit off the wall of the lift and she blacked out, waking up sometime later naked only with her shoes on next to this lad who had sobered up and was crying because he has a girlfriend and has only just realised what he's done.

She then started crying as the realisation of all that happened set in and she had just had sex with someone who isn't me. The guy then had the audacity to ask her if she could stay with him a while to comfort each other. She left, in the corridor or in his room, I don't know, but I'm not going to push for information.

When packing to come home she found a t-shirt of his and binned it along with all the clothes and shoes she wore at the time. Bad move

She doesn't know his name, she told me not to involve them so I'm not going to. That's her parent's job.

I'm just at a complete loss. I've sat here for the past two hours with a close friend just talking it through and I've decided to go home tomorrow to be with her and let her know that I'm here for her.

Has anyone else had this experience or any advice or anything at all? I want to find the guy and fuck him up something rotten but that would just make things worse... at the very least I want his girlfriend to know.

**tl;dr** My girlfriend got raped on holiday

...

**EDIT** Just got off the phone with her, to me, just proves more that this story is true... she's a hard knock and this is massive. Didn't really get much more information except that she was wearing a dress and it happened in her room (keycards are numbered in this hotel and she kept it in her clutch bag over her shoulder, easy place to find it). Going to suggest requesting CCTV from the hotel; lifts usually have cameras in nowadays.

...

**BIG EDIT** As I said, the man followed her from the elevator to her room, which is where the struggle started. That is my bad for misunderstanding and posting that on here. This explains how he got to her room and into it and all that.

To all the people who are pointing out plot holes; let me trust my girlfriend. The signal on the phone wasn't the best, but please respect that I trust my girlfriend and will be sticking beside her during this, you have to be here to understand completely I suppose.

**Massive thanks to all the kind words from people who are trying to help!**

**MAJOR UPDATE!**
I've just got back from seeing her in person for the first time since she went on holiday, bite marks and a bruise which is very obviously from where a hand has held her too firmly.

**She told me the entire story again

We went and got her hair cut; she wants to get rid of how she was. She went for her third shower of the day. She sat and cried in front of me

Going to the hospital first thing tomorrow for STI checks etc.
She's breaking the news to her parents as I type this

As for how she acts, then backed off, looked at me for a moment and said 'that wasn't as bad as I imagined it would be'. Before I left she wrapped her arms around me and kissed me, told me she loves me and thanked me for being there. She's going to be just fine, I think, given some time!

So of course, which I have to admit are valid. But he did admit that it was also a very physical attractiveness thing as well.

I have always had a love/hate relationship with food. Out eating full grown man regularly. I usually manage to keep my weight in about a 5kg (10 pound) fluctuation range by balancing my overeating with strict dieting and healthy eating, my personal life got dramatically harder for a while, and on top of that my ex boyfriend who I cared very much for committed suicide. This led to a 10kg (20 pound) weight gain (comfort eating). Once that was over, I plateaued out again and am not gaining weight, but have also not managed to lose the weight. I am mortified at it, but am struggling to lose the weight. Yes my confidence has been affected.

My issue now is that I don't know what to do from here. To be honest while he was telling me (over facebook IM) I felt nothing but amusement. I mean

Now that the conversation is over, that was never the problem, but now I almost don't now because I despise the fact that if I did lose weight, that it would seem like I was doing it for him, and not myself. I am someone who places my partners worth to me solely on personality, and who they are, and a weight gain on their part would not phase me at all.

How do I reconcile the fact that my mother loves me unconditionally and her desire to spend time and talk to me is not based on my weight

I would like to know if anyone else has gone through this. Have you also felt a complete numbness of emotion? Will this last permanently as I now have a very real insecurity that I have to protect myself from

Well, but reality is that I think I have been in denial and have been letting my feelings for her overcome what is logical here.  I really feel bad I invaded her privacy, but I was able to find out what I was looking for.

Then I'm told that he started seeing someone 2 weeks ago. He's 29. She's 19. She has been his friend for two years. She looks prepubescent and she's the most innocent person I have ever met. We were friends. He's going to destroy her. I feel bad for her. 

Only because he called me yesterday to tell me all of these things. To tell me I didn't put enough effort into chasing him. How can someone say that? 

Does anyone think it's absurd that he broke up with me and then is telling me he wanted me back

He also told me he moved on to her because he was Lamebook stalking me and saw that I was having a great time and it didn't look like I needed him. WHY IS THAT WEBSITE held in such regard? WHY IS IT IMPORTANT that I walked the fucking dog? How is it that my status provided you with so much information that you came to the conclusion

I feel like he's turning me into a monster. 

Another tidbit on him: He's NEVER dated anyone outside of his work. He's worked with Petco for 11 yrs. And the only girls he's EVER picked up, I was one of the girls...I just don't get the games or his insecurities.

1300995519.0,gapq3,My girlfriend wants to get away to a ~10 days trip with her male friend I don't know at all.,trowaway998,93,7,151,"We're together for almost two years. Happy relationship, she is regularly exchanging emails and what not with a guy who travels a lot around the world. I know about the letters

But today, I was shocked, it felt very bad, and I must admit I was quite angry as well. We had a brief exchange of bitter words where I told her I'm not really happy with her decision. She kept bringing up that I wan't to lock her up, which is not true. The deal is, I don't know this person, and after all this I wouldn't even like to get him better. She also told me that she's very eager to travel, I'm limited to my vacation days, I'm still quite upset as I'm writing these lines.

It's not that I don't trust her. I don't trust the guy. I don't know who he is

Should I let her anyway? Maybe I'm selfish to tie her down? If I keep negative, this is different. I am absolutely sure I'd feel really really miserable during those days she'd be away with another man. Not jut for missing her, as I miss her even when she's away for an hour, but now that feeling would be also undermined with a fear of losing her. She keeps reassuring my fear is completely irrational, but I just can't help it.

What should I do? 

**EDIT:** I forgot to mention that she invited me to come with them. Which is of course impossible

**EDIT2:** Quite a lot of responses

In about a year since we are living together, I just fell asleep. Before that, I've had another long talk with her. I've got more and more depressed about her decision, and it seems to me that she's absolutely unconcerned how much this hurts me (""This is an opportunity I don't want to miss""). When I asked more about the guy, she told me that I should meet him and get know him (frankly, I'm not too keen - I guess it's reasonable). She reassured me several times that the dude is totally honest and ""not the kind"". According to her, this is a great opportunity to her to see the middle east the way she never will be able to do again ever (the guy was already there, can teach her a lot about it

We've always had long-time plans together, the guy is ""not that kind""). That makes me a bit comforted, as I trust her greatly, she has rejected advances from other males while we were together, but it still won't take away my bitter feelings about this whole trip.

Now the money thing. I'm assuring you, she told me that she'll go and find a job and pay the trip from that if that's my main concern.

Last but not least. She asked me if my only problem is ""that her mate on the trip will be a male who I don't know too much?"". I said yes

I'd like to find a solution with an outcome which will make happy both of us. Yet, if she goes away, it will grind up every little piece inside of me. 

I really love her

**EDIT 3**: I'm not ""financing her lifestyle"". She never asked me for any money, the only thing that matters is to be toghether. And she adds to the household whenever possible, even when not asked to do so. If she wouldn't live with me, she'd live in a dorm (which is free here as long as she's studying), and would spend her student loan on whatever she'd like. So sharing that money is actually a commitment from her side. She's not using me.

**EDIT 4**: She's quite naive when it comes to advances from men. She honestly never suspects more than a friendly relation until a guy ""moves to deeper territories"". It was always kind of hard to explain to her how most of men's mind ""work"". Quote: ""don't let that concern you

**EDIT 5**: She's really the most caring, passion about life's several topic. As I see, she never tried to ""use me"", at least I have never felt like used. We have a great love life. We talk a lot, and even if we argue, we do it with great care about each others' feeling. This is really the first time in two years when I feel a bit dissapointed in her decision and arguments. I'm quite conservative when it comes to relationships and I simply can't get this thing down my throat too easily.

**EDIT 6**: One more quite important information I forgot to mention. She studies geography and travelling is her life. She's constantly on the move when she has the opportunity. Mind you again, I am a little bit annoyed that I was faced with a definite decision. She never asked my opinion about this trip in advance, just suddenly, out of nowhere, told me ""I'm going on a 10 days trip with him""* (\*I'm off, deal with it).

**EDIT 7 (for those who missed my quite important answer to noonan's comment)**:

**EDIT:** Here are some reasons I feel I  deserve a better explanation from her - the relationship status thing i can handle, the thought that we can never have pictures together, the fact that i have tell my friends to tip toe around it and not make reference to us on her page and give them no reason are all inconvenient, curious and irritating.

**EDIT 2:** Can I just reinforce the point that it isn't about the relationship status but about these three things most importantly:

* When we're out together
* I can't post on her wall. If there is something I want to say - I have to question myself in terms of if it's contains too much romance to post publicly. 
* My friends have had posts on her wall deleted that refers to a boyfriend or a relationship. Explaining this is difficult and embarrassing. 

**EDIT 3** Well I confronted her about it using many of the points raised in here and it looks like we're breaking up. Fuck you reddit.

Scenario: Me 19, we were together for just over 2 years.

Anyhow, we made good money, we bought a car with good payments, I put it in her name because I recently purchased a boat in my name, trying to be fair. We had been given a van from her parents as a 2ndary vehicle, as I wrecked my only car (brakes went out)

So, she's acting weird. So, one night I go to get on her computer, and it's locked, the password we usually have, is not it. I ask her what it is, she says ""here, what is it? did you change it?""... ""yeah, so I said, then I unintentionally checked her e-mail as she usually e-mails her mom every day

I said

she said: ""Of course not

So, you mean everything to me"" I smiled and hugged her and kissed her, and we went to bed. She (for the first time) initiated sex, and she did things she'd never done before, and I was amazed, and passed out right there after, comfortable once again with our relationship.

I woke up (at 2pm) to go to work, and she said ""Fine, did you know (name) was out here getting some of the boxes you guys left out here?"" and I said.. ""no she's supposed to be at work""... so, I thought she got off early and was going to finish unpacking the left boxes at my parents house (where we previously resided) and so when I decided to give her a call, there was no answer.. I texted her and waited about 15 minutes.. no reply, I stepped outside, called her again (as I'm going to my car to go home and make sure she's okay because I started to worry and I wanted to surprise her anyway) .. I couldn't find my car, this time, I thought to myself ""What did I do???? I hope she's okay!!!"" I hit the ""lock"" button on my clicker to try and find the car, the apartment was TRASHED and her stuff was all gone. 

On the fridge was a whiteboard written by her ""I love you sweetheart

She left.

It sank in

I called her

For the next 4 days, or drink, I lost nearly 20lbs. 

No reply, she said ""I don't know, I just did..."".. I asked her.. ""Have I ever raised my voice, have I ever hit you?"" she said ""no""... then why, I asked?

She said, I'm moving to (state) with my parents, and it's just not going to work.

I begged and pleaded

we talked, so we tried reconciling and we had plans of her coming up for Christmas and seeing how things go... she had sent me provocative images/videos to my phone, for the time being. She had constantly texted me I love you, and I miss you... and I bought a plane ticket to meet her in some location to drive the rest of the way back with her... then, she started acting weird again, staying out super late, at parties,ever.. 

then.. I finally had enough and I told her to leave me alone, to call, otherwise, fuck off. I never heard another word from her (this was over the course of 3 months that we were reconciling) and less than 5 months later, she had a baby with another man. that's 8 months.. it takes 9 months to make a baby (usually)...... can you do the math?

I was crushed

How could someone do so much damage to one person? How could someone have such a cold soul/heart and stare one in the eye and tell them they love you and they'll never leave you

Those questions are to this day still un-answered for me.

She cheated. She lied. She betrayed

I wish you other people in pain good luck, I'm having a kid myself in Dec. and I'm very ecstatic, and love my girl more than anything. Things get better, its hard to trust at first, but do it.. its worth it.. the pain only lasts for so long.

Thanks for reading

I hope nobody else has to ever experience such a crushing blow to the heart

tl;dr it's a story

EDIT: Thanks so much reddit

As far as I know, but I wasn't in a financial situation to do it, so I said no, it got repo'd. She's with a guy that in my eyes, isn't that attractive, but maybe he's a great gentleman, all the best to them. 

I hope nobody has to go through this, and this shit hurts!

As for the loss? Sure I lost what I listed, as a gift to her. But, that's $2500. Money comes and goes, but you know what? I'm glad she left. I'm in a great place now, like I said above, I've got a new girl, she's so beautiful and wonderful to me, a great job in the IT Field

I'm a saver, I lent him $1000. I was uneasy so I made him sign a contract and everything, I told him to please just pay off the school first. 

Now he's working full time and earns a decent amount of money but I just don't feel like he's making any progress trying to save up money and pay me back. I know it's certainly not my place to micro-manage his spending

It would make no difference to me whether he pays back the money now or later. I don't need it and it would just sit in my bank account. I just feel it's not right for him to be spending luxuries on himself when he owes me that sum of money. I try to gently remind him about the money he owes and he gets all defensive but assures me he will pay me back. So.. what should I do? Is it even my place to talk to him about his spending habits or should I just keep quiet?

--**UPDATE**--

Oh no

So I confronted him about his spending habits and as expected, but he was planning to. Then he tells me how he's saving up half of his paycheck every month and how he already has $3000 saved up... Kinda baffling why he couldn't just pay me back if he had that money saved up... So I bring that up and he promptly pays me back the amount he owes me. It ended with me feeling like the bad guy and him asking me ""Why are you causing these problems?"" So I feel like shit. I still feel like things are kinda sour between us. So now, his debt to me is cleared. It still doesn't change how different we are in managing money. So yeah, Reddit thank you so much guys for reaffirming that I'm not money-obsessed. This really gives me a lot to think about our future. From his spending habits, I've already decided that if we ever move in together or get married, we are keeping separate bank accounts to avoid more fights like this. And yup, lesson learned--I'm never lending out money to friends again. It is too much hassle

A couple of years ago, and we've broken up once or twice during it... so I'm not sure if they did anything. I ask, he insists no.

Although she and him are in committed relationships, ""I wish you were my first,"" and he said, ""I do, too."" (spoiler: we were each other's first). That's when I started to shake and lost my appetite.

I know this was hard on my wife as we had to visit a few hospitals in larger centres for care. (we live in Northern Ontario). It was hard on me too

My wife started gaining weight after that

After two years of very little sex, or to go to bed early, or to stay with the kids in their room when they woke in the middle of the night as ‘they needed her’. I talked to her about that not being good for the kids or our marriage but it fell on deaf ears.

Then I just quit coming to bed, we keep our kids busy and she really is a great mom.

Anyway

In the last month

Her suitcase hasn’t even been unpacked yet since her first trip in April and my curiosity got the best of me and I looked through it yesterday. I was surprised to find lingerie

In her top drawer at the bottom I found some American cash she had stashed away. This was surprising too has we have never hid money from each other as far as I knew. I counted the money, but I wrote the number down and put the piece of paper back in her drawer.

I Skyped the number so it would show up as ‘unknown number’

Now things start to fall into place, and she got up, went to the washroom for a bit and then went to sleep in the kids room with her phone.

So last night I tried to make excuses to see her phone at the kids baseball practice. I knew she had it with her, but I went though her text history quickly when she wasn’t around and it was blank – nothing there. This is a person that usually had 500 emails and texts saved on her phone because she doesn’t clear her inboxes. I sent a text to the number just asking if he was there and didn’t get a response back.

When I came back upstairs. She asked me if something was wrong. I told her I was upset about her going away again to Michigan. I wasn’t ready to tip my hand about what I knew yet.

I asked her if everything was okay with us. Ironically

I think she beginning to suspects that I may be on to her. So, I took that number our of her drawer again and wrote ‘I know about this and I love you’ on it.
Really, hidden money and trips out of town don’t prove anything, but things certainly don’t look good for her. I don’t know if she’s already cheated on me, or if she’s about to cheat on me and there’s still time to stop this.

My goal is to stay calm, people tell me all the time what a great couple we are. She always been a great mother, and this is totally out of character for her.

Okay, she really feels like she needs to have a break from my sexual energy. What happens for her is that she sees me constantly coming at her, and when that happens, all she wants to do is retract further in order to be safe. Yeah, some of that is because of her childhood abuse issues. But some is also just a life stage thing - she's done having sex for procreation, and wants to discover her sexuality post-children and post-procreation. And, for whatever reason

My hope is that after two weeks of experiencing me not pursuing her, she'll actually get the space she needs, and will start coming to me for physical affection.

All this being said, I'm going to have a straight talk with my wife about how I can start getting my sexual needs met elsewhere. Hopefully something could be worked out that allows us to stay together - maybe I get involved in kink activities, become an erotic massage model for training courses, take on a FWB, etc.. These things all seem pretty remote possibilities right now, but as I said, I'm not okay with this sexless marriage going on for much longer.

1361978105.0,19bvwg,My mom hit my car backing out of the driveway and says I'm trying to rip her off by arguing with the insurance company,mymomhitmycar,98,16,91,"TL;DR my mom hit my car in the driveway about a month ago. She says I’m trying to rip HER off if I argue with the insurance company for a more money for my car (it was a write-off).


My mom didn’t want to go through the car insurance company and wanted to see how much it was to fix, etc. The repair shops I got quotes from both said the crash bars in the door frames were damaged and the doors needed to be replaced. My lock mechanism also came out of where you put the key in the door and I had to disconnect and reconnect my battery to restart the alarm as it wouldn’t disarm.
About a week ago, I need new calipers, and some other stuff. Guy assessed it $500 for an easy fix or $1000 to do it all properly. Great. Anyways, my deal and a separate issue altogether.
After all this running around (university and work ~20hours/week) I talked with her and said maybe we should just go through the insurance. She has a $300 deductible and then her insurance rates would increase 15-20% (she is already at a discount) or she can pay the amount of the claim by her next insurance payment. I felt like I couldn’t do anything without her permission
I thought things were finally going to be sorted out. She would pay her deductible and I would go get my car assessed (which I was pretty sure would be a write-off

I got my car assessed and the insurance company offered $2800. I think it's worth more and was going to argue for more (I would maybe get $3200 at most). She said she heard that my car got written off. I told what had happened and said I was going to try and argue for more money on the claim tomorrow. I said the car insurance company always tries to lowball you and rip you off and I would have to buy a decent replacement vehicle as I commute an hour and over 50km each way to school. Then she got pissed and said that I shouldn’t argue for more as I was trying to rip her off. She said the more I argue for the more I’m trying to rip her off. I said I didn’t really think of it that way and was just trying to get the right amount my car was worth, money, money. She was just so mad it was horrible. I feel like I’m an inconvenience to her life. I feel like I’m the bad guy and it’s all my fault. I don’t think I did anything wrong though? I’ve never felt close to her and its creating such a rift in any relationship we do have.
I feel like any way I go

EDIT: UPDATE: First of all, more specifically BC. Everyone's car insurance is by one company, ICBC. I pay my own car insurance and my mom pays her own car insurance. I got some more clarification on the insurance. 

She has two options to pay off the claim. She can pay her collision deductible on her insurance, she would pay $300 now, and move up 5 steps from a 35% discount from base rate to a 10% discount from the base rate, increasing her insurance rate by 25%. Each year, you move down 1 step if you are accident free. It would take her 5 years to get back to the same insurance rates. The other option is she can pay off the claim directly. If ICBC gives me $2800, she has to pay $2800 by her insurance renewal date (Dec). If they gave me $3000, she has to pay $3000 by Dec. She said previously to me that she was going to go the deductible way, it would cost her the same amount regardless of how much I got on my car. She failed to communicate to me that she wanted to pay it out directly and now that I understand she wanted to pay it out

For clarification on the living situation, car insurance ($175 per month), $200 per month in gas to commute an hour to school and buy 1/3 or so of groceries. I am grateful for everything my parents have done for me and very grateful I can live with them while I finish school. I know a lot of people don't have that opportunity. I think I'm a lot more financially independent and financially responsible than a lot of students. I work my hardest to pay as much as I can on my own and come out debt free. I may not be completely independent yet, but I'm working on it. I think if you're going to school you can relate. 

Anyways, but now realised that if she just paid it out it directly increases the amount she must pay. I told her I didn't want it to affect our relationship and I would just get the brakes fixed and forget the whole thing. My dad was there that time and heard about our fight and told her she was being ridiculous and it didn't matter what amount I paid for the car, it mattered how much I could sell it for if the accident had never happened, i.e. the market value of the car I had before she hit it. He said I should get a fair price in order to afford something to replace it with. He said $200 isn't that much in the grand scheme of things, less than $20/month. He said my brakes were going anyways and it would make sense just to take the offer. My mom agreed and that's that. My car will be written off and I have to get a new one (well new to me).

Well this situation isn't ideal already.  It's odd that she's almost always hanging out with him.  She is very transparent in what she's doing with him, etc, so it's not that big of a deal.  

However, I'm not even welcome.  And she said if she brought up to him that I wanted to come, he would bitch and complain, saying it was their best friend alone time.

Again
  
  
**Update a day later**
  
So I was planning to tough it out until she got back
  
That went out the window while we were on the phone earlier. She woke from a bad dream and while we were talking the conversation went to the affair and I couldn't stop it. So we had the serious talk now
  
She had already confessed to having an emotional affair, she had decided to stay with me and the kids even though she was uncertain about our relationship. 
  
She had a trip scheduled, but I do have a smart mouth). She apparently asked me if that was really how I wanted to send her out of town, and apparently it was, because I did. She called him to come meet her on that trip. :-/ I don't even remember that trip, let alone what I said to her at the time.

She's not sure why she didn't leave then. It's been a long time, and that's when things started to turn around. They've been improving (roughly) ever since. Somewhere in there she told him it wasn't going to continue, and they haven't spoken since. The relationship started on AOL (yeah, AOL, what of it? ;-) and she doesn't go there anymore, hasn't for years.
  
Back to now: she says she read an article that husbands whose wives die are happier than husbands whose wives have affairs, btw -- and I feel much better. I'm not sure she does. There was a lot of self-recrimination. I told her repeatedly that I'm the only person who can judge whether she's what I want, and I'm happier with her than without. She's smart and funny, and still way out of my league looks-wise.

So... I'm pretty sure we'll stay together. I'm pretty convinced it was just a one-time thing, yes, she was tested for STDs at the time. I'll still probably get tested the next time I go to the doctor. Counseling is likely in our future, but if we keep having conversations like today's until she gets back, I'm betting we'll be talked out by then. I'll hit the gym tomorrow and run until I feel better or puke, whichever comes first.

She recently has been visiting with an old friend of hers who has moved back into town. He is obviously interested, I would've seen this as a prime opportunity to say something like ""Thanks, my boyfriend got them for me at the beach.""  And this would have been easy enough to *not* make things awkward and let it be known that she is unavailable. Instead, she said ""Thanks, the *person who bought them for me* knows what I look good in."" I don't expect her to go shouting from the hills that she's taken, that would be ridiculous.

First of all I wanted to thank all of those who responded to my first post. There were a lot of different views I hadn't considered and I appreciate those taking the time to read and write back.


To begin with, she needs some growing up to do. The problem though, is even though she graduates from school this year (its a technical school) she would still be living with her parents until its time for her to get married. Not to generalize, but I find a lot in the Spanish community (I'm Spanish too) to have this mentality. There's no point in leaving your parents until you get married. So she's always going to have that sheltered view and never really go off on her own and grow in that way.


What ended up happening, a couple other points. Showed it to two friends of mine so they could proof read and make sure I was being logical and rational.


Turns out she was completely offended. I apologized to her and let her know that wasn't my intention, I argued that this could be done on the phone just as easily. She said ""this is too important to talk about on the phone and sometimes saying sorry is not enough."" I asked her if she could drive up to see me instead to talk about it, but she said she didn't have the money and I was the one who screwed up (by sending the email). 


At this point I was getting upset, but if she thought I was going to drive down to see her, to beg for her back, she was mistaken. She then stated ""well it doesnt look like this relationship is working out"", and I respond ""I'll let you know when I can get my stuff"".


Thats basically where it ended. Now it also occurred to me, but all the shit that revolves around being with her, well I guess I was just getting tired of it. Taking a step back and looking at all the facts, I envisioned my future with her and everything that came with it and I'm honestly not sure if I would be happy with it all. Marriage is a huge commitment, and I don't think people should go into it with any doubts, which is why I let it get as far as us breaking up. 


So thats what happened

I'm a bit of a forever alone bachelor slob. I've been kept down for a few years because of my (recently diagnosed) bipolar depression.

In the last few weeks, cooking proper meals, and practicing piano again. A lot of these were just simple confidence building exercises, helping with self esteem.

Earlier this week, but this was the first time I had the balls to go and say hello. Chatting and flirting felt good :)

It seemed to me like she was flirting back. So with great balls of steel

Over the next two days, she mentioned that she'd text me if she couldn't make it. I guess that's when I realised that she had decided she wasn't going to come.

And on the night

I had a fun night with other friends, I actually felt ok. That's something very surprising for me, considering the circumstances.

I realise that either I read her intentions incorrectly in the first place, and get on with life. 

I just wanted to share this with everyone. It's exciting for me that I'm not an emotional wreck right after being stood up. Lithium is a helluva drug. :)",,t5_2r0cn,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/en9e1/just_wanted_to_share_a_little_story_about_myself/

Soon after we first met, she brought sunshine to my life in ways I never thought possible, etc.  About fourteen months ago she was attacked by some jackass on the street, physically assaulted and almost raped.  This, of course, was incredibly traumatic for her.  She's spent the past year in therapy, I make sure to talk to her on the phone whenever she's out alone to make her feel safe, but there are a couple things that have started wearing on me.

Before she was assaulted, she became extremely reactive and aggressive, lashing out at me when I proposed even the slightest hint of negativity or suggestion of something she might not like.  She's gotten much better about this, but it's still there, her personality has changed for the worse.  Whenever I bring it up to her she uses the assault as an excuse, starts screaming and crying and overreacting even more, and then she starts apologizing profusely

And, but we have not had sex even once since the assault.  The first few times I tried to touch her since then, she started crying and curled up into a little clenched ball of tears that absolutely broke my heart.  But now, a year later, she still shrivels away whenever I try to make a move.

Fourteen months.  I have not had sex once.  I know it sounds selfish, I need to have sex.  And on top of this, I'm not getting any younger.  I wanted to marry her and have children and lead a normal life, but it's starting to seem like this won't ever happen.  I've asked professionals about it previously, and they always say to keep taking her to therapy and to give it time.  Well.  Time has passed.  It's been fourteen months.  I miss the girl that I fell in love with.  What should I do, reddit?  Am I being impatient?  Or does this sound like a lost cause?

We had been flirting over the course of the semester(talking for hours at night, we actually hung out outside of school, and after our second date, we both confessed that we had feelings for each other. 

I feel great around her, and it had kind of ruined the anticipation for me. So I told her I wanted to take it slow.

Anyway, and other things. No genital/genital contact, but light manual stimulation on my part ensued. I stopped it at that. I honestly have never wanted anyone this bad. Everything seemed perfect.

Yesterday

So she tells me that she was with a guy 5 years ago(in college) that had herpes, and I just needed some time to think. I can't imagine how hard it would be to tell someone you cared for about this.

I asked her about it, but I know that the virus can shed asymptomatically(without sores present). If anyone can offer some insight into this situation, or give me some advice, I would really appreciate it.

Tl;dr: Girl that I'm totally smitten with has herpes. Not sure what to do.

I started dating this boy who I will momentarily name Dog Face. Dog Face asked me to move to New Jersey with him about a month ago and after much debate and planning, who I will name Broccoli. Broccoli and I are kinda tight — the kind of thing where we always end up chilling together at parties and such. Broccoli and I planned to go get Dog Face this weekend because we missed him terribly.

Well we got him nd it was awesome.... except not really. Like I said,  but this will be important later. 

So last night, like, teenager drunk. Dog Face and Broccoli decided to walk to 7-11. On their walk, Dog Face made Broccoli swear to secrecy. He then proceeded to tell Broccoli that he's been getting head from random women in Jersey. Broccoli was offended and told DF to stop that shit, because we're moving in together and I'm wife material. DF disagreed, saying something along the lines of, ""whatever happens happens"". DF then went on to say that he has herpes. Yeah, like I ask all of my partners, his ass would be kicked. Broccoli has bailed DF out of jail for assault and knows that everything that was said was serious.

But like I said, including transferring schools and jobs. I don't want to go to Jersey with Dog Face. In fact, I never want sto see him again. I don't want him to think he's getting away with shit. Broccoli has made it very clear that he doesn't want to get ratted out, and I understand. Broccoli didn't choose to get involved. And he appreciates Dog Face as well as his ass remaining un-kicked. 

I have no idea what I'm doing. 

If anyone has any ideas how to tell him that I know without saying that it was Broccoli who told me

Tl;dr
My boyfriend is a lying nd disgusting sack of shit and I want to let him know I know without telling him dhow I know.

1355150968.0,14lsz7,Wife cheated. We have two kids. What should I do?,,108,25,50,"Ever since we had our first child in 2009

My wife suffers from depression and major thyroid problems. With the relationship being in such a bad state, I never received a call back to enter their program.

Since the move and financial issues, do housework, and take care of the kids. She’s a stay at home mom with a small craft business. Lately, she’s been trying to get out of her shell, joining some meet up groups to make friends. She joined one last week, and Saturday, she ended up sleeping with someone she met from the group.

Lately, and this scene in general. Last night, I checked my wife’s text messages because the paranoia was getting to me. I read some really suggestive things with several people, and I became upset. She confronted me about my upset, and I told her I read her texts, and I left the house.

As I was driving, while I was out taking the kids to an event.

I honestly don’t know what to do right now. Last night, I’m at work, and I need to keep up a happy face. I feel like I’m not going to really make it.

**UPDATE**

I just wanted to let everyone know that I've been reading their comments

At any given moment, I'm going to try and help my wife with her mental illness issues for the interim. Some of you have mentioned that she has needs, too. And, although I think what she did was the most hurtful thing she could have done to me, I honestly don't think she went out of her way to make it happen; I think she got caught up in whatever was different, painful for herself even. She told me it wasn't fun, nor did it last long. With that said, either. With the precedent

Counseling will be mandatory for her and us for me to even warm up to trusting her again. Of course, but what I want, and what I've wanted for a while now, is stability. With waves like this, it seems further than ever to achieve.

To those suggesting divorce. It isn't off the table. In fact, and at the time we were hopeful.

Now, this event caused a seismic shift in attitude; and I feel a bit more dead inside than I did before, but I don't see it as necessarily bad.

For now, but it felt like something important at the time.

Throughout our relationship, and we'll get into an exercise regime which will last a month or so, then one or both of us get lazy, and the regime falls apart.  Whenever I suggest we start it up again, or notice her eating unhealthy foods, I'll ask her about it, or remind her, for fear of her lashing out.  There was an occasion before the wedding that I mentioned it head-on

She made a personal goal to lose ~30 pounds for the wedding, and I encouraged her all the way.  About three or four days ago, I casually mentioned that I was thinking about going back to the gym and asked her if she'd like to join me.  This turned into a defensive argument with her, where she accused me of having ulterior motives and thinking that she was fat and unattractive.  Ultimately I decided to stop ignoring the elephant in the room (no pun intended) and confront the issue directly: I told her that her weight was becoming an issue for me, and that I wanted her to want to do something about it.  She immediately shut off, and told me to leave her alone, and refused to speak to me.  She's interpreted my words as ""you think I'm fat and ugly"", cruel

That was three or four days ago.  She hasn't spoken to me since.  She waits for me to fall asleep before coming to bed.  I left her flowers by the bed last night while I waited in bed for her to come home -- she asked if that was my way of saying I'm sorry for calling her fat and ugly.  I tried to explain that I didn't think she was fat or ugly, told me to leave her alone, and went to bed.  I persisted (this is a few days of not speaking, for god's sake), and explained my bit in full: her weight was starting to be an issue; I know that it hurts her to hear it, but I couldn't keep it inside.  I didn't think it was shallow, or selfish, and I wanted to talk to her about it openly.  Regardless of her weight, it might become a serious issue in our marriage.  I explained all of this to her

I've asked her to come see a therapist with me sometime soon, and communicative with her, and talk to her about this issue as politely as I can, but I'm being met with the worst kind of defensiveness and lashing out as a result.

My fiancee made it clear to me that he hates the dog. He hates that he sheds, he hates that he has to buy food for him (we take turns as well), he hates that he lays its head on his lab if he wants to play, he hates that he puts the toy on the bed, he hates when the dog tries to jump on the bed(I trained with him and he is only doing it if he is really exited or needs to be exercised). 

The last point was the reason I am writing this post. He was overly aggressive to our dog in the past but today following happened:
We left the dog alone for 4 hours and when we came back he needed to get a walk. It was my fiancees turn to go out with him but he said he is tired so he just laid down. The dog

I am strictly against his impulsive behavior and he did something like this in the past. That's why I wanted him to apologize. I can not tolerate this behavior. I don't want him to abuse the pet we adopted.

He says he can't apologize honestly because he does not care that he hurt the dog. He wants be to keep him away from him.


I am shocked. I thought of giving the dog away so our relationship would be great again
How should I marry a person so cruel? That does not care about the dog or my feelings of his behavior. I honestly think something is wrong with him. Should we go to a therapist and talk about this? It is not normal right? help...

**TD;DR: My fiancee pushed the dog with force and it is bleeding on its head. He says he can't be sorry for it because he does not care if the dog is hurt or not.**

She has basically had to initiate everything from asking me out, meeting her parents, first kiss etc. It doesn't help that neither of us have done this before - we were both each others first kiss, first BF/GF and at the moment we're both virgins.

A week ago she got rather drunk and talked about how it annoyed her that she has had to do everything by herself. She asked me if I liked her before she asked me out and I said yes but I thought I had absolutely no chance with her.

A few days ago I annoyed her even more:
We both live with our parents and we had spent the evening at my house eating the face off each other for a few hours. We were on the floor of my living room staring into each others eyes with one of my hands up the back of her top and the other running up and down her body. She asked ""Are you trying to be such a fucking tease or are you just this much of a dick?"" which confused my useless slow brain

After another 10 minutes or so of cuddling she decided she wanted to go

Basically what I want to know is what the hell I'm supposed to do next. How to overcome my lack of confidence and make her happy. There's not much we can do at our parents house but hers aren't at home a lot of the time.
What do I say during those awkward silent staring into each others eyes moments?
How can I compliment her without it being immensely cheesy?

I'm not sure how to phrase this

She was fired from her last job for poor customer service. But she's convinced that she was fired because she was too good at her job

When I was in high school she tried (unsuccessfully) to get one of my English teachers fired, my mom didn't listen. She thought the teacher was unfairly marking me just to be a bitch.

Once she tried to return a couple skeins of wool to the craft store because she wanted a different colour. She had a little slip of paper saying that the colour she wanted was on reserve for her, she'd decided that the cashier was ""completely evil” because ""she just ripped up that receipt in front of "" us and stole the wool so there would be no proof""

She was a housewife for nearly 20 years. I'm 19 years old now

I need to go to school so I can get out of fast food service. I can’t go to school and support us both. We’ve already been homeless before I gained full-time employment. If I just up and leave her I’m almost certain she’ll end up homeless and eventually dead

At the moment she’s working an an essay or sorts to send to the government, and I don’t want to. I know it’s full of nothing but crazy. She’s been saying it will be finished “next week” for the past three years. In it’s very early forms, when I was still a minor, she yelled at me until I started crying and then video taped me crying, and made me say stuff like “the government is forcing me to go into foster care” and a bunch of other shit. She deleted it though, I think she must know that was a bit too far and would bring her criticism.

Sorry for the giant wall of text.

I’m not sure what to do. I feel like every day I go to my shitty workplace and not to school is wasted. I’m still young

Thanks Everyone!


Like title says

We have 2 dogs together and have traveled to Europe
I work from home and make pretty good money
She comes from a not so well off family

Anyway, lets call him K. they would be texting like high schoolers and playing games on the iPhone, even though they saw each other for 12 hours a shift, He is her Preceptor.
I told her in a nice way that this made me uncomfortable and if anything i would at least like to meet the guy to avoid any future problems.
She tells me not worry about K bc he is her boss and his wife also works with them and is about to have a baby. So i think OK..but still slow down on the texting a little bit. she agrees. 
After a week i notice she never leaves her phone unattended anymore

I went to walk the dogs and when i got back she had deleted the texts and many more

I tell her to stop all contact with this guy who clearly more than her friend. she says no because she just started this job and doesn't want to start drama there.

the fight escalates and we break up because she could not and did not want to stop talking to her new friend.

after 10 years she picks him over me.

fast forward 2 months:
-he was never married
-doesn't even live with the mother of his baby/ some girl he knockedup
-the mother of his child wrote her a nasty message telling her to stay away from K. this is after we broke up
-shes already dating another guy different from K
-she blocked me from her phone and fb
-im still telling her i love her like a fucking loser
- i feel like alien is coming out of my chest

I just needed to get this off my shoulders
if she came back should i give her a chance
i feel really shitty right now.

EDIT: what hurts the most is that shes already dating so soon
the therapy is helping im also taking flying lessons

EDIT: Her main problem with me is that i smoke some trees ever now and again

Being deceitful with another man=Smoking occasionally???

Also forgot to mention that on new years eve she went to have a mimosa with him after work...at 8am

However I'm not rude

But I only like this in very very small doses. Most of the time I like to be by myself. I spend lots of time reading books, etc, and am contented this way. When I do do social things, it's invariably with a small circle of close friends. I do not have trouble making friends, I just have all the friends I want.

The trouble is, so when I hit that age, I changed my life, as an experiment. I started saying yes to any social invitations, attending dancing lessons, dressing up and hitting the clubs every Saturday night. And sure enough, I hooked up with a couple of girls.

The trouble was

Now I'm back to my old habits. But I want some sex. However I refuse to pretend to be some social gadfly.

But how the hell am I meant to get any action?

I've considered the following:

* Fapping: Not the same. Real sex is better. Plus

* Making a lot of money: I'm content as I am. I have set myself up with a non-demanding job so I can spend time doing the stuff I enjoy. I am not going to become Captain Workaholic just so I can buy flash cars and score a trophy wife.

* Meeting girls at work or through work colleagues: I work in the computer field. It's a friendly workplace but there is only one female in my age group. She is not single and has no female friends.

* Online dating: Have reviewed sites in my area for potential hook-ups. I live in a fairly remote area

* Prostitution: Am not interested in sex without any emotional connection.

So what the fuck am I meant to do? I'm pretty damned sexually frustrated here

tl;dr: I don't like to go out much and so don't meet any chicks. What's the solution?

Let's say I'm upset for whatever reason.  Maybe I feel overwhelmed by work, from experience, nothing my boyfriend will say will help,  but unfortunately I can't hide my feelings very well and I'll probably sigh or something.  My considerate boyfriend, hearing the sigh, will ask ""What's wrong?"".  I'll tell him, and he'll listen and then respond with the worst fucking response possible:

""Hmmmmmm.""

WTF!  Boyfriend, I'll ask ""So what do you think?""

""Well

Argh!  It's bad enough when I'm only suspecting that you don't know how to comfort me

""I love you.""

Okay

That's it.  That's 90% of what I need from you.  The other 10% is a hug.

Let me backtrack more. When my friend “Jane Doe” was 18 she moved into a house with him, his girlfriend. Even though Jane Doe was sleeping with this guy she was too young to know any better. He was physically and emotionally abusive to both her and the girlfriend. Jane Doe eventually wised up and moved out, after almost two years. 

A year after that she started casually sleeping with this guy again. Then she went on tour. Two months later she came back and here I was

Then one night

Did I mention he is an alcoholic? Not just any alcoholic, obsessive and unhealthy in fucking love. 

He abused us both. We both loved him. We loved each other more because we were suffering together. It bonded us in a very serious way. We all eventually lived together. NOT in the same room. This wasn’t too much like that

I don’t hesitate to mention that in some ways he was amazing. He taught me to play Viola

 When I left him I moved in with her (roommates). She knew him

Two years ago he moved to NYC and got married. He was convicted for beating up his new wife and she currently has a restraining order against him. He came back and beat up another girl he started dating. He has been homeless and living in a half-way house with 500 other men for close to a year. He found out where “Jane Doe” works and started coming in. She started dating him again for some reason. Obviously it is ruining our friendship. 

I told her I couldn’t be a part of her life if she was going to try to have a serious relationship with him. She and I talk every day, or saw a good movie. It makes me sick. He doesn’t deserve her.  I can’t be a good friend and go along with her decision. Help me please. I need advice. She is pissed that I am giving her an ultimatum. I cannot help it. This is crazy!

1331913498.0,qziat,Boyfriend blames me for needing to find an apartment because I'm not ready to let him move into my house. Could use some advice. ,peapodpixie,87,7,68,"Hey all. I'm a 23 year old woman who has been dating a 24 year old man- let's call him Jake- for about 6 months. I'm also a frequent redditor

Three months into dating, 3 months was way too early to move in together, but I wanted to be there for him. I told him to stay as long as he wanted, but I thought he would look into other places while he was living with me. He didn't. Slowly, one closet became his, a second litter box to accommodate his cat was crammed under a shelf, and we bought new mattresses and a bigger bed frame so both of us would have a place to sleep. 3 months seemed too early for all this, kind guy

About a month ago, made a decision to move to a retirement community. He wanted me to have his house. We made a deal and at the end of summer I will be moving into a beautiful old house that I am getting for dirt cheap (love you, grandpa). 

Being roommates with Jake, I'm really not ready to share my house with a boyfriend who I've only been dating for six months. I move at a slower pace than that, and it just seemed a bit too much, too soon for me. 

I was honest with Jake about how I felt. I explained to him that I wouldn't be leaving the apartment until my lease is up at the end of  August, and told him that I would help out in any way I could.

I knew he'd be upset, and he blamed me for upsetting and depressing him by forcing him to move out. He told me that if he couldn't find a place to afford on his own, he would have to leave me and move back to his family three states away, and he indirectly blamed me for that. I apologized for all of these things, and I told him I'd help him look for a new place. He told me he didn't want my help because I'd just be condescending. 

A month has passed since then and Jake won't discuss the subject with me. We are still living together, and then asks me to stop talking about it because it upsets him. When this isn't on his mind, however, he continues to be a good, kind boyfriend, if a little moody.

I know how frustrated and worried Jake is right now. I'm trying to be understanding about it

Jake has always treated this relationship like the be-all

I am stuck on what to do. I don't know whether to break up with him now

1371487300.0,1givly,Nightmare Scenario: I lost my girlfriends dog. What steps do I need to take to save the relationship?,,99,22,160,"I'll start off by giving the back story

My girlfriend of less than 1 year and I live together, minds well, and sticks by my side even off the leash. Her dog is skittish most of the time and only is really comfortable when she is around. Even though we both knew that he was skittish, we both agreed that it would be ok for me to walk him. Honestly, I didn't mind walking him at all because I wanted to create a bond with him and get him to trust me.

Each of our dogs have their own leash. My dog's leash is just a regular straight leash that I loop together around his neck like a lasso. I don't clip it onto his collar because he is so big and it does just fine. Her dog is small and has a retractable leash that attaches to a harness. This is the key detail of how this whole nightmare unfolded...

Last Saturday (6/8/13), I decided to use my dogs lasso leash. There wasn't any reason behind choosing the different leash. It was just hanging up where it was supposed to be while his regular harness leash was in my gf's car. So I slipped the lasso leash onto him and took him outside for his walk.

Everything was going fine until we were ready to go back inside. I wasn't really watching what he was doing

He got about a 10 yard jump on me and I ran after him as fast as I could but he was not stopping. I ran as far as I could and eventually lost sight of him. At that point I ran back to our apartment and got my bike to try and cover more ground. I looked for about an hour on my bike but I was never able to find him after I lost sight.

I woke my girlfriend up and we started the search by notifying all the neighbors and putting up flyers. Its been about nine days now since he went missing. We have been doing everything we can (posters, but we haven't had any luck. So, That is the back story of how everything went down and I'll go on to how our relationship has been since the day he was lost:

The moment I woke her up and told her her dog was lost she was livid. She started slapping me, lazy, careless). I was telling her that I know you are mad but save that energy because right now we need to focus on finding him. As the first day unfolded she went on to saying things like ""You are so fucking horrible for doing this to me"", ""you are a murderer"", and "" I will never forgive you for this"". I understand that she was mad. I get that, but it really was an accident and I would never intentionally do something like that to hurt her. She eventually apologized that evening and said ""I'm sorry for saying those things earlier, and I understand it was an accident"". So I think she isn't as much angry as she is sad now.

Over the course of the nine days that he has been lost I have been doing everything in my power to help her find her dog. She still has the stance that she doesn't know if she'll be able to forgive me if the dog doesn't turn up. Basically

Everything was going fine in our relationship up until this point and we were getting along really well together. My questions are that is it wrong of me to hope that she will eventually forgive me? What should I do to show her that I truly care about her and that I want our relationship to continue?

I am truly heartbroken that this happened and she is so hurt. I can't even imagine how it feels to lose your dog

When I was 17 I graduated from high school (92) and joined the military. My first post was about a four hour drive from my house and I spent weekends and leave back home. I continued talking to a girl who had graduated in my class and we were eventually married. About 6 mos after I went on two deployments and then was sent for an unaccompanied tour (can't take spouses/kids). I was gone for 9 mos on the first deployment, I started to receive calls from creditors for unpaid debts that ranged from the hundreds of dollars to the thousands. It took a couple months to understand the full scope of what had happened, but my wife had racked up over 50,000 dollars in unsecured debt while I was gone, using my signature as cosigner to all these loans. This put a huge strain on our relationship, but I felt we were recovering slowly. Little did I know, she was also cheating on me during this time. We went to counseling and decided mutually we couldn't reconcile the relationship (partially because it came out during counseling

I was despondent about this whole process and its outcome and came here to post about it. The advice was varied but the general concensus was to grieve the loss

Update: 
   I lost 100 pounds that I had gained after leaving the military and going through the depression and strain of the divorce. I went back into the reserves and have a civilian job that corresponds to what I do for the military (ATC). During the divorce, I saw her (she had gained at least 30 pounds and looked like she had some bad botox) I also met her new husband and their 4 kids. The second night was a mixer at a local lounge. After a few too many drinks, my ex (who was a stumbling, sloppy mess at this point) approached me and began crying her eyes out telling me how miserable she was. Apparently she just found out prior to the reunion her husband was cheating and wanted a divorce. On top of it, she knew for sure that one of their kids wasn't his and suspected another might not be. It might be petty, but I felt vindicated.

**EDIT 2:  Just to clear up a mistake I made, and I was 20.  Sorry for the confusion, and thanks, everyone, for your help.  It means a lot more than I'm able to show...**

I apologize in advance

I am 22, and about a month ago, we had a little falling out, and we were considering spending some time apart.  We decided to not be so rash, and to think about it for a week or so.  She went out on a lunch date with my mother to discuss everything, and from what I can gather from my mother, was 110% adamant about staying together.  I had thought about it, and we were both quite happy about working together towards our future...or so I thought...


This last weekend, so they were coming to pick her up. (We live about an hour away from where they are)  The biggest thing I was worried about was her being stranded somewhere, so I asked her to just check in from time to time to reassure me that she was OK.  (I'm an excessive worrier, and I get it from my mother.)

Well, but I couldn't tell what it was.  While she was gone, she didn't call or text, and kept dodging my calls/texts, which didn't help my worrying at all.

When she got home, and after a small discussion (I can't say argument here, because it really wasn't.  We were both pretty calm about things), she suddenly said that she didn't want us to be together anymore.  This completely caught me off guard, and I didn't know how to react...After me asking why a lot, and her not really giving any reason, I asked her to sleep on it

I kept thinking that something wasn't right, I went home and we talked a little more.  I worked out of her that while she was with her 2 girlfriends, they invited over about 4-5 guys, whom all she didn't know, and they all got drunk and partied.  I will admit that I was upset, and I even said so, but I didn't question anything...that is...until I worked out of her that she did know one of the guys

I then expressed that things just weren't adding up, and confirmed that that was, indeed, what had happened.  I...didn't know what to say...

She then went on to say how much better in bed he was than I, so I left to my parents place for a shower, and some time to think...

When I came back

I'm still deeply in love with this girl.  Call me names, and they are resurfacing fast.  I've gone from having a pretty stable 5 year plan to not knowing what I'm going to be doing next week.  I'm lost.  Again, this being my first relationship, I don't know what to expect, nor how to handle all of this.  I just don't....know what to do...

Not really advice or asking for some

A week ago I broke up with my girlfriend because I couldn't handle her anorexia, I broke up with her saying I needed to look after myself, not her, and she said to me, without word of a lie - ""if you can't handle me at my worst, you don't deserve me at my best. You'll kick yourself when I'm better, get out of my house."" And that was that.

Since then she's slept with three different men

Anyway.

**How I found out she had been lying to me for 10 months**.

She was raped ten months ago. Or at least, I said to myself, she needs someone and just be here for her. So I was, for ten months as she used the rape to slip back into anorexia, stop us from going out and basically put both our lives on hold. She never reported it to the police and she never told anyone the full story. Her cheerleader friends didn't seem to care, which is strange 'cause I know that when one of their group was raped a while before they rallied around her like you wouldn't believe. So it was already ringing up little bells in my head. But I figured, I can't call her out because that would be fucking insensitive

So I just let it slide. No matter how many of my friends say her story just simply didn't check out.

She had thrush; apparently caught from the rapist in her lady parts, but I kept that tucked away. The fact that she was apparently screaming for help and her friends in the rooms beside her didn't help, rather thought it was just 'loud sex' also rings up alarm bells. But I kept that also tucked away.

Well

Over the week, before she could delete the post on her wall, I saw on there ""Hi, I'm *name* who you met in *holiday destination* and took back to your room for that crazy night. Just noticed you were single now so thought I'd hit you up to see if you wanted a repeat without any guilt after"" or something to that effect, I was so riled up I forgot to screenshot or copy paste.

Anyway

What the fuck, don't just brush them under the carpet if they're as big as what this was. My whole idea of mutual trust has been ruined. I told her that I was going to tell everyone about it, and she begged and begged me not to, saying that she will be ruined and everyone will hate her etc. I told her I didn't care, but I won't tell people on the sole promise that she does.

I know she won't

Since I called her out on it, has started eating again and has gone back to being the girl I fell for originally. Complete mind fuck except that I know now I hold the status quo.

So the day I posted I spoke with my husband and informed him that I'd stop nagging him, I agreed and said that I was separating our accounts. He flipped out, started yelling and actually threw a few things around. Told me it wasn't good for our marriage, etc. I had plans with his sister, and when I left he wasn't speaking to me. I went ahead and did it anyway, and spoke to his sister about it. She'd recently broken up with someone who wasn't pulling his weight financially in their relationship, either



Then I had to go to work and he still wasn't talking to me, but the house was a little tidier when I came home, and he was speaking to me and being nice. I'm not sure how long this will last, but I finally got up the courage to call my brother and tell him what had been going on. Needless to say, he was upset. He agreed with what I had already done and told me several times to stick to the deadlines I had set and not let anything deter me.



Back in February I had informed my husband if he didn't get a job by the end of April, etc.) and I'm definitely nervous about following through, if it comes to that. He seems motivated but still has yet to apply anywhere, and I just got hired to start a new job in a few weeks so I'm worried he'll use my change of schedule as an excuse. I'm mostly worried that I'll end up moving out and our relationship won't recover. I really do love him, I didn't marry him on a whim, but I need to make sure the people in my son's life are setting a good example for him.



TL;DR: I'm not sure if things are better



Also, it is still something I'm interested in. I have several friends whose parents are accountants who let me know about the field before I dived in, so don't worry.

I also feel the need to mention that I don't plan on, he will always be his father, and I will always allow him time with his son. I only said I was taking our son with me because I know that as long as he is with me, he will have everything he needs.",,False,,False,t3_1bll7g

Basically, but whenever he leaves we have to douse the room in Febreze (usually multiple times) because his feet smell that badly. I've noticed he'll wear the same socks 2 or 3 days in a row, and tried to bring it up once a while ago, but he got really defensive so I stopped.



The other big problem is his penis. He's really great in bed, so I honestly didn't know this was abnormal for a long time.

Most times it's not unbearable, but it was really bad today so I tried to bring it up in the least confrontational, least mean way possible (we were going to have sex but he really smelled, so I basically said hey, but you kind of smell off sometimes. Do you think you could clean up a bit?) and he got super upset

Context: I financially supported him for our entire relationship. I was open and communicative with him. We shared everything. When I was having a bad day, I told him. He was a wonderful boyfriend, but he never left the apartment, rarely took me out, rarely saw my performances (I'm a performer), and never liked spending time with my family. So, my sister went to Paris to finish her PhD

While I was gone

My boyfriend blows up over IM while I'm in Europe

He breaks up with me before I even understand what's happening. I'm furious that he betrayed my trust and read my emails.

He picked me up from the airport, and even tried to change all the passwords to my accounts. He managed to calm down and move out a month later. 

A couple weeks after the break up, and deleted it.
I made the mistake of letting him back into my life because he wanted to start over with a casual sex relationship. Before I know it
During all this time

He came over last Friday, pulled my hair, and slapped me. He shoved me against the wall and started throwing things at me. I finally got away and hid in the restroom and threatened to call police. He left instantly.

I moved back in with my parents after this situation. Ever since, I'm the crazy one, the abusive one, the manipulative one. The reality has been that he never listened to me or let me say no. He never listened to ""no"". I still have the bruises on my body from what he's done, but he still won't leave me alone. 

He's been cyberstalking me

But apparently

To make matters worse, and he wouldn't eat while playing videogames).

I did give him my reasons for breaking up with him

TLDR; I'm going through a really terrible violent break up. Help!

I've been married since last september.  It's been great for the most part. Our biggest issue is overcoming debt (mainly mine) so that we can afford to buy a house. But apart from the occasional argument

Recently an old ex-boyfriend of my wife's started texting her. She was honest and told me that he has and that he had told her that she was ""the one that got away"" and I know that he has said ""sweet"" things to her and played the ""I bet your husband doesn't do that for you"" card on her and generally just being a snake. One morning after attending the baptism of a friend's new baby

She deletes all her texts and always has as long as i've known her. And when I asked her about the vulgar text I saw she said she doesn't reply to those

She's going out of town back home to visit her mom this weekend, and she tells me that she's only doing it to give him closure, and make him get the picture that she's married and that theres no chance and that I should trust her since we're married. 

This week

I'm concerned but I don't want to be that overbearing insecure jealous husband that makes a self-fulfilling prophecy and push her to do something with this guy. I've been cheated on in the past and so i have a deep neurosis about this kind of thing

I need some help to know what to say to my wife to illustrate how much I love her

TL;DR My wife has been texting an ex from high school and will be meeting up with him while out of town visiting her mother. I'm not thrilled about it and need advice...Please read to get details.

EDIT: WOW FRONT PAGE!! I didn't expect this much response! thank you for all your help

**UPDATE:** Thank you all for your support and advice. It means worlds to me that you each took time out of your days to help out a stranger who was just feeling lost.  Many of you expressed that i should ""grow a pair"" and ""stop being a doormat (pussy)""  All things that are true

Last night after work, then it's her decision to make and I cannot command her not to. But my concern is that he, having made clear his intentions with the vulgar texting, does not respect her as a woman, or our marriage, let alone me. So my concern is what message that would send this boy about our marriage and commitment to one another

At this point, and said, ""I'll cancel on him right now and not meet him."" She then proceeded to tell him, via text (while letting me watch) that she would not be meeting with him out of respect for me. And that she will not be seeing him ever again. Within moments she received a reply, a very angry reply. He was swearing at her and called her a bitch and complained that he had changed plans for the meeting etc. etc. She then replied that she was sorry that he had changed plans but that she didn't truly care because ""My husband matters more."" and finally ended it by deleting his number and texting him to ""Lose my number"" which was what she had told him when she broke up with him in high school. 

We then had a decent conversation about my feelings and how appreciative I was of her understanding in this situation.  

Thank you all again, ohmygoditskatrina, for your real and honest advice and concern, and especially Helios410 for the book, I'm reading it already, and  its got great tools to help. And finally Deradius I can't thank you enough for putting words to my feelings. It was your suggestion that formed the framework for me to eloquently state my case and for that I cannot thank you enough. 

My wife and I stayed up late last night talking about it all; and you've all helped me to find something in myself that i had lost. Be that my courage or masculinity or whatever you want to call it. I'm on the road to being the husband that my wife needs and deserves. I told her that i was sorry for not giving her the attention that this guy was

She always says how she's going to save up for a car/apartment/tv/etc. but NEVER sticks to her word.  

A few months ago she made a pact that she would quit smoking

I occasionally point out these issues but she just basically says ""fuck you I'll do it when I want"". It's really damaging are relationship. 

Whenever I try to talk to people about it, lazy, coughing and smells like smoke. I feel like a douche even making this post, but it really **really** bothers me. I don't want to break up with her because I love her to death and can't imagine life without her.. but this.. this is really making me consider it. She says she loves me.. but if she did why isn't she trying to change? :/

1335372317.0,srz9c,"My girlfriend is sick, and there's a shitstorm brewing. [very, very long]",dudewheresmythrow,94,112, this post feels more like catharsis rather than a call for advice on what to do next. However I am willing to listen to anybody who feels like offering any thoughts

Nature of the relationship: boy-girl, living together in an apartment for the past eight months. We've had some difficulties before that I've posted under this throwaway.

A couple weeks ago, I waited with her while she awaited a diagnosis, and I stayed for her surgery and admittance to the recovery clinic. (The day didn't end until about 2:30 am.) For the next few days, they kept her in the hospital, making sure she was okay to go home with some regular medication. She came home for a few days, but then had to be readmitted to the hospital when she developed an infection. It took almost a full week for her to be treated properly and be discharged from the hospital.

During these couple of weeks, but it's been difficult to keep up. Back when I still had my job, I thought it'd be a good idea to give my girlfriend a credit card that was under my account. Turns out that was a mistake, and since I did that the debt on the card has been rampant. I am going to have to take drastic measures to deal with the debt because we can't pay it off in full at the end of this month. I was going to have a conversation with her about this, but then the appendicitis happened and it didn't seem like a good time any more.

Because of the stress, or my smartphone. I would waste some time on sites like Reddit, because I badly needed distraction from dealing with the situation. But, I was also trying to job-hunt. Additionally, it was not like I was not helping out. I watched over my girlfriend, helped administer her medicine, and ran errands for her. But to her, I didn't really know what my place in all of this should be. We live in the same city as her family, and ended up following her orders rather than trying to work with her as a partner in care of my girlfriend. This created some tensions.

One morning near the end of her second week in the hospital, and thought I needed to see a therapist. On top of that, she wanted me to go back and be with my family (several states away) for a couple of weeks or months. I felt somewhat shocked, but I knew that I hadn't been acting quite myself, so I immediately fell into guilt and pretty much kowtowed to her. Later I spoke to my parents, who thought that my behavior was pretty much to be expected given the stressors I was dealing with. They didn't think I was narcissistic, and they didn't think I should come home.

That same day, and was pretty out of it from drugs. She asked me, in front of her mom, if I had discussed with my parents what we had discussed earlier in the day. Because she wanted to talk about this in front of her mom, I balked at first, and my girlfriend angrily snarled ""bullshit"" at me, and her mom escorted me out of the room. I was pretty upset at this point...I didn't think things had gotten this bad. I talked to my parents again, and asked me what it was. At this point

Right before I went to bed that night, and found out she was having emergency surgery to deal with her infection. I rushed to the hospital, and texted her and her mom that I was there. Her mom came down to the lobby where I was waiting, and flipped shit on me. She told me my girlfriend had cried herself to sleep that night because she didn't know what had happened, and that I was bumbling, useless, and was not to see my girlfriend again until she said so, completely horrified and miserable.

A couple tense days pass. I pretty much get more of the same from my girlfriend and her mom. Yesterday afternoon, but I call my parents again to tell them about it. They urged me not to leave, for several reasons:

* I have paid the rent in full for this month and next month

* I have no money of my own left

* I am an actor involved in a theatre production

* She is from the city we live in

* On top of these more immediate things

My family helped me compose a letter saying all of this and that I had changed my mind and would not be leaving. After much hand-wringing, and I don't know what's going to happen next.

We sat down in the living room as I said. My girlfriend and I had prepared a little information sheet on me, he seemed to take everything really well.

My girlfriend even asked him if I could come with them to some annual event they go to, and he said that would be good. So it looks like a lot of progress was made.

I can think of a million reasons that she could regret the tattoo, trying on multiple outfits, and I don't think this can help. Her response is that she can put a band-aid on it. The larger problem is that I think it will embarrass her down the road.

I know my thoughts on tattoos are more conservative than some, its not so much that I don't like the idea of tattoos, as much as it is I know she will regret this down the road and I don't want to see her unhappy.

At least, be completely wrong. Perhaps I am only justifying my overly conservative value-pushing through mental gymnastics. At least I'm sure that's what she thinks.

I smoked about half a very small bowl every weekend for four years on and off. I also did ecstasy three times and mushrooms twice. There was also an instance in which I did methadone

Once in a while my boyfriend gets very upset that I did these things even though they happened years before we dated. I have since decided to stop doing drugs. This is a choice I made on my own. However

She would tell me the same things like ""I'm nervous that I won't have friends"" or ""everyone here is so nice, I don't know what to do."" (I still don't really understand why that last one was a problem). She never seemed to make any friends, and she started to come in more and more. I honestly wanted to be that friend that she never had and help her break out of her shell, but I didn't work out. I feel awful saying this, but she just became too much to handle.

It began to get out of hand, I would just be lying in bed, and she would come in the room and then literally flop on top of me and just sit there. She would lean on me, poke my arm muscles and just be generally creepy and pretty much intolerable. She also continued to talk about her problems which I really couldn't help her with.

I am gay, and one day when she was creepily flirting with me in my room when I really needed to be studying, I just told her that I was gay so that she would stop bothering me and back off a bit. She ended up leaving a while later, and it seemed to work.

I found out later that she began talking to my roommate about how sad she was that I wasn't interested in her

After a while she began coming in my room again, but on weekends I would have lots of friends coming in and out, and she would always find her way into my room. Sometimes she would wait in the lounge for someone to come into my room and then follow them in. She would make my friends uncomfortable while we were trying to have fun, and she continued trying to flirt with me.

I decided to send her a text after one night when she was acting particularly badly. I told her that she shouldn't waste her time chasing after me and I reminded her that I was gay and that it just couldn't happen. She said ""okay

One Saturday night my roommate forgot to lock the door when we went out to another dorm to hang out. He came back at about 12 to grab some food from out of the room and he found her in there alone

1360790423.0,18gw3c,I [M19] got told to marry my girlfriend [F20] or break up with her.,JigglyCow,83,10,70,"We have been dating only 2 years. I am extremely happy with the relationship and my girlfriend appears to and says she is happy with it. My girlfriend was originally never going to go to college and was just working a dead-end retail job. No one in her family has gone to college so they all said ""You don't need to go to college."". Both of us feel that I managed to give her a chance at a better life because she was raised to ignore her options. My family loves her and I get along great with her family despite some differing opinions. However now a wedge is being driven between me and her family.

I was raised from in a catholic family. They don't believe marriage is a good idea until you are at least 25 or have stable careers started. Living together is fine if it is must. They approve of my girlfriend and I living together due to both of using going to school out of town and not being able to afford an apartment alone, an uncle's, and a cousin's. All of them didn't get married until 26+ and dated for 3+ years.

My girlfriend's family is on the complete opposite of the spectrum. Nearly all of them have gotten married at 18 and had children before 20. Surprisingly
All of this is very hard on my girlfriend because she was raised and taught that getting married very young is completely normal and the right thing. She has seen no bad in her family with it and many of her friends (who I have 0 respect for) are getting married and even having children. She has the thought ingrained in her that if you are happy in a relationship

My girlfriend and I discussed everything last night. She admits her upbringing and feelings towards marriage might not necessarily be best. She told me that she understands my opinion towards it and will never push it on me because she is happy just to be with me. She says although she still has a strong desire to get married, we are young and our personalities are likely to change in the coming years, and I don't think 2 years is long enough to fully get to know a person. I'm not seeing why we can't just live our lives and not 'rush' anything.

Now

If my girlfriend tells them to stop bothering us about marriage, car insurance, school, and medical bills (over $2000 and rising due to surgeries/injuries) are paid by her parents. Her car is under her parent's name. They are threatening to take all of that away. My girlfriend has also got most of her hours cut for her job. She is having trouble paying her half of the bills. Her family doesn't want to help unless we get married so now she is forced to get help from my family. I have been told that her family is going to slowly make her life harder until one of these things happen:
1. We get married
2. I break up with her or she breaks up with me
If neither happen then they are practically disowning her until one of those happen. This brings a hard decision for me. Do I give in so that we can be comfortable during our college years

tl;dr: Girlfriend's family is pushing us to get married. Ready to push great financial burden on us if we don't give in and basically disown their own daughter.

Things were going mostly OK, and all demanding to know where I was. She was in the hospital. She tried to kill herself by overdosing on her antipsychotic medications. She was committed to a mental hospital for 3 weeks, and I was allowed to see her for only half an hour every day. I said I would stick by her as long as she promised to never miss a dose. She then stopped coming home, so I packed up my things, said my goodbyes, and moved out.

I cut off all contact with her. I was utterly alone, doing the things I always wanted to do when I was with her.

He tried it when he was 16, he didn't like it. He had always been attracted to only girls, and still was. The thoughts continued, the thoughts were unpleasant and bothered him, plagued him. We met when we were 18, and dated until now. He never mentioned the thoughts, sometimes less. Yesterday he sat me down and told me he had these thoughts, he got no pleasure out of it. He said that usually he could get rid of the thoughts by masturbating to them, he wants us to work it out. I'm shaking as I type this

I'm hurt, and betrayed, and confused. He loves me so much, is full of guilt and regret. We have talked about going to therapy, for him especially, and couples therapy. Even if that were to somehow help him not have the thoughts, I don't know if I can get over this and continue to be with him in the same way, very guarded.

I don't want anyone else. I want marriage in 5 years and kids in 10. I don't want to be alone. But I don't want that to be the only reason I stay, BYE. ""I enjoy having sex with and blowing men, but I'm also attracted to girls."" OK, BYE. But this is different. This is, ""I have thoughts only about giving a blowjob, and I enjoy the thoughts but hate actually doing it and am not attracted to men and don't want to do anything else with them."" The FUCK? Assuming he's telling the truth when he says it's just that one fantasy, he hated doing it, WHAT IS WRONG WITH HIM? I told my mom

Should we try therapy? Am I delusional to even think that we could get help, or just because we've already invested so much, or for some stupid reason; I would NOT do that. I want to stay because we can get past it, and because we love each other. I'm just scared if I can love him in the same way.

My hairstyle - I've been losing my hair for a while now (Not full blown bald, but it's really thin) - that I can't do anything about. My hygiene is absolutely not an issue - I take care of myself more than the average dude. I am not even chubby. I don't have the flattest of stomachs, but it's barely noticeable.

**FINAL EDIT: Just had a long conversation over the phone with her. I told her all my concerns, which shows me she cares. I asked her, like some of you suggested, exactly what it is she wants me to change. She said she doesn't care for how I look anymore, she's way past that, but she wishes I cared a little bit more as she things I have a IDGAF attitude about everything. She apologized for the word ""ugly"" - she said she couldn't express her thoughts well 100% with English not being her first language. She also said she doesnt care at all if I change, because she sees herself as the one with a distorted view of me and she will try to change herself. However, we are good. And I still love her a lot.

We used to do it like rabbits or at the very least once a day. Now getting him to do it with me is like pulling teeth. It doesn’t matter when I ask him the excuses are always the same (I’m tired

I’m reduced to sex *maybe* once a week and that thing sees action almost every day. I know I know sex with a real woman is exhausting

I’ve tried discussing it and he doesn’t like talking about his flesh light. He used to have a clear one that was just a clear tube with bumps and no attempt at looking like a vag (it was a freebie we got with a purchase) now he has this ugly thing that I think looks like a vagina if they came as Happy Meal toys. It’s an odd chewed bubble gum pink in an unsightly gold casing. I used to love watching him use the clear one and asked him to let me watch him use the new one but he refuses

I thought that time might be an issue at first since he likes AM sex, it’ll be too hot, he’s too tired (and stays up reading until 1AM), he just doesn’t feel like it, etc. 

I’m to the point where I have to ask about it fairly far in advance like I’m penciling sex in. I have to say “I wanna have sex tonight.” Or “We’re going to have sex this week.” He decides from there. He never initiates it anymore.

TL:DR I suppose I’m just bitter that he’ll turn me down then in the morning go use his stupid toy. Especially since he won’t talk to me about it.

He made me feel pretty bad about bringing it up and I know this is wrong. I have every right to protect myself by being honest. He told me all I have to do is just ask what his intentions are. 

He then went on to write a status about how anyone who believes chivalry is dead needs to take a look around them.

1336316960.0,t9qhk,"Husband may have undiagnosed PTSD, I think I want a divorce. Please, please help. ",sadwifethrowaway,84,52, but 2 pups that I love like children.

When I first met my husband, showed his emotions in the relationship well, and was an absolute blessing to my life. The most amazing thing that has ever happened to me. 

We got married while he was in the USMC. During his first deployment overseas, he shows up drunk, telling me he doesn't love me and he doesn't want to be with me anymore. 2 days later he comes home. 

We start working on our relationship and things are going well as he's getting ready for his second deployment. He left, find him a new job, etc. finally things physically settle down, but emotionally they take off.

I'll start by saying he has never once been violent with me, and I began to get frustrated. My frustration and anger caused him to lash out in anger and we spent most of our time together fighting about petty bullshit. 

It all came to a head when, I said I didn't want to talk about it and he went into the bathroom, and slammed the door. That made me cry even harder, and he came out of the bathroom and we got into a huge fight. By the end we were exhausted and just fell asleep with no resolution. The next day I told him that I wasn't sure how much longer I could deal with his aggression. He decided that he wanted to work on himself, but in order to do that he couldn't live with me. This completely fucked us financially. We had to cut the lease short on our apartment, and he had to pay additional rent to the guy he was moving in with. I moved back in with my mother. 2 weeks later he was living with me at my mom's (this was in December 2011).

In February '12, he manipulates it so that I'm the bad guy. He's constantly pissed off about something. If we fight and I cuss, he'll completely interrupt me to tell me not to cuss at him. Turn the whole argument around into how I cussed at him. 

Since his return from his second tour, he loved meeting new people and was never rude towards strangers. I'm such an empathetic person and when he says things like that about other people, it pains me and makes me so angry and uncomfortable. He just doesn't get that it's inappropriate. Just talking in the car one day, I asked him, ""You know I'm not, but how would you feel if I was pregnant?"" He told me, ""I'd pray for a miscarriage."" It makes me sick just thinking about it. Maybe I asked for it in asking that question, but I don't think that's very funny at all.

I'm just so sad and heartbroken. It feels like the man I loved when I first got married is gone. It tears me apart to think about leaving because I do love him so so much. I just... I don't even know anymore. When I think about him or I being with someone else, where my dogs would go. I just want to be happy with him. How can I be happy loving him, when he's just a cold, hateful shell of who he used to be? I'm so lost.

1321460043.0,mehqn,Is there an age you start to settle for anyone who's mostly right?,freelance_teadrinker,86,13,90,"Hello Reddit. First time on here. Eek! Anyway...

I'm 33. My SO is 31

All this is majorly confused by issues surrounding parental abandonment (my mother moved to the other side of the world when I was 15; I've seen her a couple of times since but otherwise have no contact with her) and still having feelings for an ex. 

I've been deeply in love twice and neither time it's worked out; they just didn't love me as much. One moved to the other side of the world (yeah

I'm wondering if falling in love is really realistic any more. When I have, and felt like nothing else on earth. But I ended up getting hurt and taking a long, long time to get over it. Maybe love like that burns out very quickly?

My current SO is lovely - supportive, nice to spend time with. I have an issue with the amount she drinks (fairly regular binges) but that's more because I don't do anything like that any more than any prudish anti-alcohol thing. I don't like her smoking, and she's said she'd give up but never managed to, and that's just about the way it makes her hair smell and the nasty kiss taste. Oh, and the things which niggle me a little about her make my best (female, married) friend absolutely detest her. But she's never approved of any of my relationships. I don't think she ever will.

Thing is, but because I don't love her yet. Maybe in enough time I will. Maybe I don't need to; maybe in time it would just grow into a decent enough, not passionate but therefore simple long-term thing built on friendship.

So, wait for true love again, and possibly never end up with what I want?

1318951935.0,lgcy3,S.O. weight gain makes sexual attraction difficult,soweightproblems,98,26,109,"I have been with my girlfriend for a little over two years.  She was heavy when we started dating but not overweight and she was working out regularly.  However since that time she has steadily gained weight and become very inconsistent with working out.

About nine months ago I asked her to please start trying to lose weight and work out for her health.  She agreed that she probably should and that she would start watching her food intake and workout regularly.  I offered to help her in anyway that she might need.  She preferred to keep me completely in the dark about what she was doing.

Since then I would try to ask her about her weight from time to time because it seemed like she was continuing to gain weight.  She always responded with either crying or getting mad and leaving the room and then crying.

She has continued to gain weight steadily.  This past weekend I decided I needed to talk to her about the issue.  It turns out that she is happy with her weight and thinks that she is healthy.  Her blood pressure and such is always okay with her yearly physical.  It also turns out that we met at a thin point for her weight and she usually weighs about what she weighs now.  Since it was clear that she felt that she is healthy I

It was a big surprise to me that she is okay with her weight.  She can be very vain when it comes to her age (she is 28)

We live about an hour and a half apart and generally only see each other on weekends.  I have never asked but she has probably gained about fifty pounds over the past two years.  Enough that she has had to purchase new clothes a few times

Other than the weight issue she is smart, she has gained so much weight that I have become somewhat grossed out by her body which has lead to severe issues with intimacy and is starting to spill over into other areas of our relationship.  

Sex now feels like a chore to me and neither one of us is getting off.  I used to be able to get her off, which is not long enough to get either of us off.  A lot of positions are more difficult now, she refuses to get on top and we can't do some of the things we used to because I'm not strong enough with her added weight.

I've never thought of anyone else besides my current partner while having sex before but now I am sometimes forcing myself to so that I can get off and finish inside of her.  I feel pressured to get off inside of her because she puts so much emphasis on it happening and takes it as a sign of my love

It might be possible that what I do to maintain my level of fitness intimidates her.  I was a fairly successful runner in high school and college and continue to run heavily today.  I absolutely do not expect her to be as fit as I am.  I just want her to be more attractive and healthy.  I'm afraid she is overly stressing her body as she is already having issues with her knees and back.

Am I jerk for asking her to lose weight or is it reasonable to expect a significant other to maintain a certain level of attraction?  How do I talk to her about this?

The Story;
I stumbled upon her vibrator in a suspicious spot the other day, but then I remembered her telling me she was going to send me some dirty pics a couple of months back, and then chickened out. She has recently gotten a new laptop and she barely uses the old one very much (if it all) since then, so I chalked it up at the truth.

She went out tonight, a hunch led me to search her mail for his name, then I noticed a bunch of attached files she had been sending him. Pretty much the first email I opened was a few nudes shots of herself. In fact, they were the ones I found on her laptop earlier. These pics go beyond anything she has ever sent me, and go way beyond porn.

After a little more hunting I found about a dozen similar emails she had sent before last Christmas.

My blood pressure went ape shit

In a mad attempt to hide my actions I sent her a text that I was using her new laptop. She logged out of gmail almost immediately. I managed to save 2 of the original files before i got kicked.

I check over her old laptop to find the original pics

The Dilemma

  What the hell do I do? 

  She was probably only jerking off with this guy so I am not entirely sure if it counts as cheating. I definitely don`t want it to continue and I feel betrayed and emotionally destroyed.

  I really really love her

  How the hell can I point the finger at her if I was snooping through her private email? Its pretty fucking hard to call her untrustworthy when I myself was committing a huge breach of trust.

1307465434.0,htuv7,I have definitive proof that my girlfriend is cheating on me. Now what?,detective_in_love,87,14,207,"**The setup**

So I've been with this girl for 3 months now. We have a great relationship, and I respect that because I trust her. Yesterday she received a message from one of her good guy friend. He is a guy she works with sometimes and they have been friends since before I known her. That guy is married and has children (this is important). The message was, literally, ""I want your ass"". I ignored it, thinking he might be joking. But then my girlfriend started to chat with him, and would always minimize the messenger window each time she sent a message. And when she was receiving a new message (the icon in the taskbar glowing orange), she didn't open it immediately. She would ask me things like ""can you go get something"" or ""can you start the movie"", I managed to see a part of the conversation and it looked like they were flirting hard. I should have ask her or confront her about it but she clearly didn't want me to see that and I thought I was just imagining things. Later she just turned off her computer saying ""I'll turn this off, from that same guy: ""where are you now?"" and ""at lunchtime?"" I was more and more suspicious. She was also more ""loving"" than usual. Little kisses

This morning she chatted with him again but they were talking business and she didn't hide anything from me this time. She usually wear makeup

**The proof**

I'm all for privacy in a relationship, I had to be sure. So I check her messenger history. Shame on me. But strangely, it was almost empty. There was only her conversation of this morning. At first I was kinda relived because I feared I would stumble upon things that I didn't want to see. But then I noticed that the recycling bin was full. I looked at it and there it was, the history folder. Copied it from her laptop to my computer, took a shower to calm myself before starting to read, and then I read it. It was not a long history. It seems that she is deleting it from time to time. So I got straight to that guy's history and started to read. And there it was, the final proof that I needed. With all the sexy details, they were having a affair from before I was in relationship with her. I don't care what happened before our relationship

**Now what?**

Now I don't know what to think or do. I was not suspicious of them since the guy was married and had kids. But now I remember all the time that my girlfriend was acting weird when talking about him. How she told me he was cheating on his wife and how it was ""so stupid"" and how she would never have sex with that guy. I want to forgive her but I just can't let that be without talking to her about it. And of course I can't tell her that I read her messenger history. She's guilty of cheating on me but now I'm guilty of spying on her. But even without the messenger history


**tl;dr** : I was suspicious of my girlfriend cheating on my. I looked at her messenger history for proof and found out I was right. How can I talk to her about it without reveling that I look at the history? I still love her and I still want to be with her but I don't know what to do.


**Update**

So just before coming here, etc. She tells me that she would never sleep with that guy, because he has a wife and kids. So I tell her more specific stuff, like how she told him that ""last time was perfect"" while they were talking sex yesterday. Then she says that yes, they had sex in the past but it was some time ago, and that yes, it was good. (seeing a contradiction here?) At that point I wanted to forgive her. Maybe I was mistaken? Maybe she wanted to have sex with him last weekend but didn't because of me. Then she was less calm, that I didn't want her to go out with her friends, saying I was stupid to have told her that just when she got rubbed

I don't feel so bad about it now. I think her last action, saying she was with me everyday for a week now and that there was no way she would have cheated on me, etc.

I guess I will know how I really feel about it in a couple of days.


**Update 2**

I wrote her a big message on Facebook right when she left. I told her why I was upset and why I asked her about that. Mostly what I felt about yesterday. And I told her everything I knew about her and her friend. I told her it was clear that she was in love with him but couldn't be with him because of his family

She texted me back later to tell me that I was right about her loving him and that she was dating me to forget. She told me that she was really falling in love with me. But she ended her message with ""too bad!"" Then she told me that if I had never been snooping, and we would be happy now.

Hello RA

Well it's 6 months after I found out my Wife had been cheating and a lot has changed. After finding out the first thing I did was get the kids DNA tested. Then I spent the next two weeks sleeping on the couch and having endless conversations with my wife. The more we talked the more I felt like the world's biggest chump. I had poured my soul into fixing the relationship and was wracked with guilt while she was out fucking some guy. 

But I also couldn't see myself just walking away. She'd been in my life since we were 15 (we are 29). So I agreed to start therapy immediately and see how I felt after talking to someone else. To say the therapist was a bit shocked by our story is a bit of an understatement. This lady was pretty blunt in saying that nearly all of our problems stem from my Wife’s actions and she needed counseling just for her

My other ‘conditions’ were that she cut off all contact with ‘Steve’ and that we talk openly about everything. Any lies, but I figured that since I’d been lied to for 3+ years I had the right to do a bit of spying). 

This puts us at roughly 4 weeks after I found out and finally the results from the kids DNA tests come back. ALL MINE! That was such a relief that I can’t even describe it. It almost felt like I didn’t care what happened with my wife anymore because I knew my kids were mine and I’d always have them. And one thought stuck in my mind the whole time was “I can accept that people make mistakes

Therapy was going well

The next day I confronted her and told her I couldn’t forgive what she had done. I told her I could probably move past the cheating

That Monday I contacted an attorney. Fast forward 4.5 months and I have my own place, but I’m just no where near ready to trust anyone. Part of me thinks I’ll just put off dating until the kids are out of HS. The kids are sad that we aren’t together but we keep all of this away from them. No arguing in front of them and no bashing the other when they aren’t around. 

But either way I think I'm on the road to recovery. And feel free to ask anything

I don't want to believe that my wife is cheating on me with another couple

**Summary**

I'll give the summary first, and somebody else now wears her face.

**Long Version**

We've been married for ten years. We faced everything together, and we still have an active sex life (at least 3 times a week). However, things changed a few months ago. We both moved to a new city and took new jobs. My attitude towards work has always been that I should do the job, get paid, and go home. I never work overtime unless I'm getting time-and-a-half, unless I fucked up and need to fix it.

My wife has a different attitude towards work. She gets obsessed with it. She won't put it aside unless she has to. It was never really an issue before because she worked in places where she couldn't bring work home with her, and expects me to sit there and wait for her while she ""finishes one more thing"". She doesn't drive, and has no desire to learn or get her license.

I talked to her about it this weekend, but it's strictly perfunctory, as if she was using my penis as a sleeping pill. There's no love or foreplay any longer; she just wants me to lube it up, get it hard, and put it in. 

She won't read anything I've written any longer, with no end in sight, and no compensation for her time and effort.

I told her I was worried about her

I asked her to tell me what was wrong

I have posted in the past about my abusive relationship but now it just took a turn for the worst.

It started last night where I wanted to sleep early (10PM) due to lack of proper sleep the previous night ( I was re-organizing the apartment and have a small chat (less than 5 mins) with a buddy via FB); so as I proceeded to sleep yesterday night

She went with me to my parent's pad to use the PC (we don't have one/Internet at our place) so I said OK. I was in a frustrated mood due to lack of sleep and was mostly quiet in the car trip from LA. Fast forward after eating breakfast, I told her I was simply tired/frustrated due to lack of sleep and nothing against her at all. So out of anger, she punched me in the street corner in front of people claiming she's tired of my excuses; and out of pain, I called her a bitch and walked hunched-over to work. 

As I was en route to work again, she won't be there, all my stuff would be trashed. So I told her that I'm going to call the police and she told me: **""who are they going to believe in domestic abuse? You over a woman?!""** and then walked away.

The time I got to work

**tl;dr:** 
My anger-problem ridden gf just assaulted me in a street with people witnessing it, and I'm afraid I have dug a grave for myself.

Part of me still like her but I'm both mentally and physically scarred from now on and in dire need of any help but my issue might not be taken into consideration and swept under a rug.

Background. We are living together for about a year now. We both don't have or want children (had this convo when we started having sex). Neither of us have been married before. We can usually talk about anything. He's the man I want to spend my life with and he tells me he wants to spend his life with me. There's trust

When we began dating he'd make jokes about past girlfriends wanting to ""tie him down"" how they'd want him to say ""The L Word"" right away and when his ex got married he said ""dodged the bullet with that one!"" Though this sounded like an odd way to communicate I still respected his boundaries. I was sensitive to allow him to move the relationship forward on his terms. 

So we dated about a year

Fast forward a year later, I wouldn't break up with him, I am asking only for clarification not his hand. Sheesh. I feel as surprised about this as I was when he asked me to move in with him. Wondering if this is turning into a pattern. I feel like I'm pulling him into this kicking and screaming. Again.

**edit** Thanks for all your responses

**edit 2

His response: 
* His last girlfriend of three years was constantly trying to get him to marry her. She was married before him and got married about 5 months after they broke up. (So it becomes clearer why he went all deer in the headlights. I really tried not to take offence at this. Yeah
* Almost his entire family has experienced broken marriages (not his parents

After he was done explaining his reaction I told him it's not right to lump me in with people he didn't respect. I understand now the word marriage is a trigger for him. He heard me say it that first night and nothing I said could have stopped his mind from reeling into the past.  He said ""marriage was not completely out of the question, I told him flat out that ""deer in the headlights"" reaction was never acceptable. When we fight it's okay to take a step back and cool off... but never revisiting the issue is detrimental.

Basic synopsis is that I [27/f] snooped on my SO's [33/m] laptop(s) after living together the past four years. We are in a serious DB situation and I wanted answers. Holy fuck did I get them. The usual porn, a little surprising, I just read

Some Background: 
Less than a year into our relationship we were pretty much in a DB situation, and my already faltering self-esteem. Slowly, our sex life faded into nothingness at about year three, which is when this phone sex incident with his ex went down. I was working full-time between two jobs, he wasn't working at all, and I was pretty depressed. We had a miscarriage right around this time, with a pregnancy that was unplanned. From this point on, we talked about marriage and kids in the future, but this priority goes on the back-burner amongst all the other shit going on in our lives. I want to marry this man and I believe he wants to marry me. However, but I'm still paying about 80% of the bills with 100% of my income and no health insurance. So we may not be having sex

The Confrontation:
When I confronted him about what I found when I was snooping, I ended up giving him a second chance. I demanded to see phone bills in the near future to prove he wasn't still talking to her. He said he'd do anything to prove that this was a one-time, selfish mistake.

The Aftermath:
Never gained access to the phone bills. I snooped a few more times after the initial time. Not proud. Tried really hard not to. Knew he was still not being 100 with me. Found that he had talked to the ex at least once, being a very empathetic and sensitive person. But the fucking circumstances! In three more years, I'll have been with him for the same amount of time he was with her...will she still be in his life? Am I wrong to want her out of it? She cheated on him towards the end of their relationship and he cheated as well...am I destined for the same long-winded fucked-up downward spiral that only becomes hot once he's lost me and is with someone else? Is the only thing that turns him on the fantasy and dirty-talk associated with cheating on me? Can I ever gain confidence in this situation? Can I ever be a domme? I want to be. I want to be everything for him. Everything but our sex life is so good when it's good. Everything including our sex life is so bad when it's bad. At what point is it worth it and at what point am I just in fucking denial? Can't talk to my old friends about this because they will simply say to leave. Can't talk to fam about this because it's pretty explicit. Feels better just to vent to strangers, as dysfunctional as that may be...and I can't afford therapy right now so thank fuck for y'all.

I've known her practically my entire life and we've always been great friends, and it pains me to think about life without her, but I'm beginning to suspect that this feeling is not exactly mutual. She is still technically married to their father, but they rarely see each other and jealousy is a non-issue. However, she did basically leave her husband to be with me. I did not push her to do so, but I feel quite guilty whenever I consider breaking things off.

The main problem seems to be that we've gone back to just being good friends. Raising two children in addition to working and taking care of a house certainly takes its toll, but at this point it feels like she's not interested in anything more than cuddling. Our conversations about the issue quickly turn into arguments, and she insists I'm trying to attack her no matter how delicately I bring it up. I hate to put such importance on something so trivial but I can't imagine spending my life with someone who seems to have such a different sex drive. I'm worried we're simply too different in this regard, and it will always be an issue. She's currently not even on the pill, or any type of hormone therapy.

Another problem stems from her job. She works a 9-5 at a local shop in town, and stave off boredom. I have the luxury of working from home and running my own business, so we're very secure financially. But lately she seems to think that because I work from home, that means we must cater exclusively to her job. One of the kids gets sick? She goes to work and I take care of them. Kids home for a holiday? She goes to work and I take care of them. She has to stay late? I need to drop what I'm doing and pick them up from school. She doesn't even ask me anymore. She just assumes I'm capable of dropping everything, no matter what, no matter how important, to care for them. I'm not sure if you've ever tried to do paperwork or talk to customers with a sick 3 year old on your lap, ""what would she do if I had to go into an office every day, or caring for them when sick isn't what bothers me. Instead its the fact that she doesn't even bother to consider the fact that she might need to make sacrifices too

It feels like we've become nothing more than just roommates, effort, emotion, and money into someone (my gf) who seems to be going in the opposite direction emotionally.

To be honest, but maybe I just needed to vent.

My fiance used to be really, he is always worried about his weight and his appearance. He wears a size small, but still frequently asks if he looks fat.

Now, working 50 hrs a week while in school full time getting his doctorate. His schedule has been tight, and he had to cut out exercising from his routine. He hates it, but he's barely finding time to do anything these days, the poor guy.

So we've been dating for nearly 6 years and have lived together for about 5 and a half of that. Basically we are very close and do most of everything together. 

I just graduated college and started my career. Things have been ok for the most part recently (no more school stress has really helped!) except my birth control Id been on for years suddenly started causing a lot of hormonal issues for me the past 3ish months. I've been in and out of the doctor trying to figure it out and finally start new stuff this weekend. Anyways it has resulted in me being unstable where I get very upset over things for no real reason. Not all the time but several times a week. It's been rather difficult for us both and I have felt really out of control and terrible about it all. I've been doing everything I know how to control my outbursts but it feels like I have reverted to a 6 year old with no impulse control. I feel very lucky he has stuck around this long.

Well last night I had a really rough day at work and wanted to just curl up and watch a movie with him and was annoyed when he wanted to go and get ""medicine"" from his friend because we still had plenty and I didn't understand why he couldn't do it the next day. I was irrational about it and got much more upset than I should have like has been happening lately. He went and did it and it really irritated me so when he came home I was not happy and we started arguing. I raised my voice and he came over and slapped me. I don't have any marks and I'm fine today so it wasn't like he punched me or gave me a black eye

I don't know what to do, seemed pretty annoyed at me still though.

Also I've wanted to marry him for years but he keeps coming up with reasons why he isn't ready, not sure if that is normal or not after 6 years. I mean I've known for several years I wanted to marry him no matter what happened and even though I get annoyed when he goes through rough phases I never don't want to be with him. He has it great, I cook, clean, he gets blow jobs nearly every day, I have a great career, am a real looker

If I should leave him, laundry, and to just hang out. I love them to bits and they would be crushed as would I if we didn't work out. I'm strong but I'm not sure I'm strong enough to not go back to him.

We were together for 10 months until she ended things because she wasn't in love with me anymore. This happened 4 months ago. She now has a new boyfriend and I am currently involved in a FWB situation with her best friend (though I've known this friend before I met my ex)

This is last night:


I went out last night to a pub, haven't you?"" I was like what the fuck? Since I haven't talked with my ex for a good 3 months now. We ended up talking a lot. Well ""talking"", just me telling her how much she has changed negatively. That sounds really rude but it's basically what I told her, I'll be honest.


My friends then left because they were drunk. I stayed there with my ex, literally waiting until I was looking and then making out with him, while she knows I've been seeing a psychiatrist because I relapsed into an old depression after the breakup (all is good now though).

The pub we were in closed so we both agreed to a truce for tonight and moved to another pub for one last drink.

There we continued talking about how life has been/our future plans, been traveling a lot lately while she's just a general mess really, getting blackout drunk every Friday/Saturday night, embarrassing herself and her ""friends"" (not my words, that's what her 'friends' say)


She was drunk last night as well and she ended up telling me she cheated on her boyfriend, that I've moved on. I then told her goodbye and asked her to please not cheat on her boyfriend again (he doesn't know about the first time) because it's not a nice thing to do.

10 minutes later, it was crazy and I could totally have scored with her again but luckily I told myself fuck it, you've came this far, not going to ruin it all by doing her) and how she was really thinking of doing something and how she felt really attracted to me. She then again begged us to be friends but I told her that that's not an option at all. That I've tried plenty of times to be friends and that she rejected every single time, and that I'm now rejecting her offer and hung up.

I am not sure if this is what adult relationships are supposed to feel like? Are all these crazy strong but usually unrequited feelings from our youth really purely hormone induced? Or am I just numb (after a lot of rejection and way too much self reflection about every single aspect about me and my feelings)? Or ist it films and books that make us think we should have these incredibly strong feelings all the time with these incredibly flawless partners?

Also: When I was young, not knowing anything about them. Today if I see someone really sexually attractive or cute but realize they would not be intelectually stimulizing to me, then there is just no way I could really feel something more than just hornyness for them. On the other hand, when I am attracted to someone intellectually, I might not be as incredibly horny all the time and craving them every single minute of the day.

She was quite shy but I had a huge attraction to her and asked her out

We've been living together 3 years with some small downs

She has no friends, she just sits there on her own, never making any attempt to talk to anyone of them.  

The next day she'll be in a bad mood, no desire to engage in conversation, i'm guessing she feels awkward about the night before, and then she says that my female friends hate her and are rude to her.  From what I can tell they just don't talk to her as she makes no effort herself, they would have no reason to dislike her.  If I dare suggest that they aren't rude to her, i'm always told that I side with them and don't listen to her.  Honestly, they are not rude to her and anytime she isn't out with me they ask why and send on their regards.

It's very hard for me to be myself around my friends when the girlfriends are out too

She also has no hobbies

She always says I never want to do anything with her and gives out to me, doesn't share any of my hobbies.  We end up just walking around and grabbing dinner.  She never suggests anything really to me, but I feel like I'm constantly putting on a show for her to keep her happy.

These issues have caused rows before

I'm confused

She was very suspicious of some of my female friends when we first met and kept telling me she knew they were into me, if they did like me that wouldn't be my problem.  Also anytime a girl friends me on facebook that she doesn't know she always has to know everything about them and questions why I would friend these people and that it's ""strange"".

However, 4 years ago when my gf and I got back together, I only told her that girl and I kissed once. It wasn't until a year and half ago where I told my gf thr truth (the girl that I hooked up with transfered out of my school 3 years ago). Additionally I did lie about the names of themes of mixers that I attended, and hid some information about them a few years ago. That has been why she has some trust issues.

My girlfriend has some interest in being a writer, because she said it was good practice. She's not especially popular, as far as I know, but she's successful enough that we get a little extra money from it. However, she won't tell me her author name (she publishes under a pseudonym) or let me read her work before she puts it up. She's pretty private, so this didn't surprise me, but I was always interested in checking out her stuff

Usually she turns her computer off when she's not using it (I don't know her login info), while she went to work. I didn't have work that day, and realized it was on. Obviously I shouldn't have looked at her stuff, but I mostly just wanted to see if I could read anything of hers. Along with the stuff she puts on Amazon, which I did find, I also discovered that she writes a lot-- a lot-- of stories about boys having sex with adult men.

I didn't read all of it (we're talking tens of thousands of words) but I skimmed through some of the files over the course of the afternoon

* They're all about boys.

* They're usually 8-12

* Some of it was pretty nasty stuff

* Maybe 80% of the stories I looked through were from the POV of the kid

* Some of the stories pretty straightforward sex, actual plots, etc. She had obviously put a fair amount of thought and effort into coming up with them, even though they featured kids having weird sexual relationships/dynamics with adults. Also some of them were more romantic? 

* She wrote other stuff, both of which had sixteen/seventeen-year-old girls as the main characters and no sex, and the erotic fiction she publishes (all of which is between adults).

I have my own kinks as well, except that I also found a folder she has on her computer that has pictures of boys in it. There were a couple hundred files, and I didn't look through all of them, but the few that I opened didn't appear to be illegal, mostly kids in bathing suits/shorts/etc. Sleazy, but not actually pornographic. That seems much more borderline than writing, though. If it were just her own stories/imagination, but this seems like legitimate attraction to pre-pubescent children.

After I'd looked around for a while

This came out of nowhere, but this is really sitting kind of weird for me. Neither of us has kids, and my GF has stated a couple times that she doesn't really like kids and doesn't want to be a mother (I don't want kids either). As far as I know, she was never abused or anything as a child. I'm also kind of worried, because like I said, she's pretty private, and I don't know what else she might have on her computer.

We had sex the other day, but when she asked me about it I just sort of brushed it off. Do I break up with her? She hasn't committed any crimes, but I'm not sure how to forget this, or even if I should. I have no idea how to bring this up, especially since it's something I'm definitely not supposed to know.

thank you so much in advance.

Let me begin by saying that BF and I have been dating since high school (both 16) and we’ve been together for the past 4 years. I’m not about to go on a tangent about how loving and compatible we are for one another, it was a long and forgotten issue but now im not so sure. 

Okay, the friend moved away for a job as a manager for a tech company and the girl, let’s call her Kate, had grown on my BF’s friendship circle, so much so that she integrated herself into the clique.  I don’t like the idea of a recently single girl that I don’t know hanging around BF, I get curious about this Kate, so I search social Medias but I just can’t find her anywhere. I resort to reading text messages between BF and Kate to find out more about her (they mostly about talked about things like cars, and other people) but then I found some that were obviously about me. They weren’t anything sexual but just as bad, she was actually trying to HELP him repair things. We fought about the fact that he was texting her so regularly

Through the BF I find out she doesn’t use Facebook. I’m still uneasy about the fact that I know nothing about this girl, we have nothing in common and I don’t really like them too much. We have absolutely nothing to talk about besides a standard greeting and the awkward offering of a drink when I have to tag along with BF to one of their houses. But that’s another issue… 

.......................................................................................................................................

Kate had been dating his friend Bob for 6 months and for the whole duration of their relationship I had never met her, her hobbies or what not, and instead of laughing along, I would become infuriated. He knew how insecure I was about the texts but he justifies his time spent with her because its in the company of all his other friends. It’s not like he was trying to make me jealous, but the topic of Kate was a frequent one. I envied how much fun he had with her because I know I can be abit lazy and unenthusiastic about some things sometimes, but that’s again another issue...

4 weeks ago BF threw a little get together in his apartment, knew me by my first name, engaged in awkward small talk (on my part unfortunately), asked why I never came out with them, and left me to go mingle with my BF’S friends. This made me feel inadequate because I felt like I, the girlfriend of 4 years should have been on better terms with BF’s friends. Not this Kate. That night I made a giant effort to get to know his friends and we’ve been getting closer ever since. I go out with them occasionally, but Kate is always there

Firstly, she seems carefree. It’s affecting me every time I go out as a group with BF because I’m constantly trying to show her up (that’s so pathetic to see on my screen typed up) I try and come across as happy as possible with BF by leaning on him and stroking his hair and laughing really loudly, she hardly looks my way when we do and if she does, she smiles! I just have this fear that she’ll steal him or he will leave me for her, and if you saw her, none of you redditors would blame me. Everybody thinks shes so damn funny, he laughs like a loon whenever she tells a joke

I’ve become obsessed. I constantly surf through BF’s iPhone pictures and messages with hopes of coming across her (not because I hope he’s cheating on me, I linger on that photo and it makes myself feel like shit even more. I emulate the way she acts sometimes (playful no fucks given attitude) because I know BF finds it attractive. I have recently pretended that I’m into her kind of music, the slow metal/metal/psychedelic kind which I absolutely loathe, just in hopes that BF won’t leave me for her. Ive started talking about science and Philosophy to appear smarter, i find things that shes clicked on on reddit and read up and learn everything about it. ive started runing and doing sit ups.

She’s into everything I’m not. She can talk for hours with BF and his friends about camping, travel, culture, cars, fitness, computers, for Chan, the experiences she’s relayed as “profound” and “life changing” can go for hours with everyone engrossed except for me. I just dont find her hallucinations interesting

She’s become the object of my obsession. I know its unhealthy and that I need to stop. I keep telling myself that he chose ME, what if he wants something new? What if he’s tired of 4 years with me? It tears me to fucking pieces having to think about all this shit.

So this may be a little soon to be making a whole new thread for it

I got off work a little early today thanks to the holiday tomorrow. I went home to pick up her flowers and some cookies. When I got to her house they were both home, and said if my mom didn't leave this time she was moving out and going to live with my dad.   

My mom came out of the bedroom shortly after I got there and told me my step dad was very apologetic and calm, stand to look at him, understand how he can do what he does. I couldn't stop thinking ""What does he live for?"". He's constantly telling her and us ""fuck you, you're nothing without me"", but in reality his own children don't talk to him anymore, and all he has are the drunks at the bar that only associate with him because he's the owner. We have each other and the futures we're building for ourselves, he's got us. If we're gone, and she PUSHED me to ask him. I felt scared and quite a bit awkward about it

She knocked on the door and said I wanted to ask him a question

The next hour was spent with me mediating a talk between them. I told them why their relationship was failing (mostly HORRIBLE communication) and what they would need to do if they were willing to fix it. My mom was spilling out her heart to him about how lonely she was and how hurt she is about everything. Instead of apologizing

I took her outside and told her this time, and it was painfully obvious.   

She told me she was disgusted, and we can't wait to move on.

I don't want to control her and I want her to enjoy herself. When she goes out it's only in our small town so its not like its an all night drinking fest or something.

I was and am devastated. I had noticed she had withdrawn a bit lately

Thing is, but I haven't been the worst either. Never cheated on her. I've provided for her, bought a nice house to raise a family in, she drives a nice car. I've been there for her in the darkest of times, including when she miscarried a baby last year.

So she's been lying all this time.

She's staying at her friend's house right now. She did agree to get marriage counseling. We went to the first session last night. I thought it was really good, she didn't want to try to work things out.


The therapist did ask her that (playing devil's advocate) if we were to get divorced, however many years down the line, would she feel guilty that she never gave me the chance to try to change for the better and work things out. She danced around the question and said something about not knowing how the future would play out.

I don't know what to do. Literally on Friday everything was fine and I felt like I was in a loving marriage and Saturday it was all shattered.

I am hoping that some separation will lead her to think about things and decide to give us another shot. I'm not calling her, because whatever I say it seems to push her farther away.

He confessed everything roughly a week ago and I am in disbelief. I've been hurting since and I just don't want to talk to him for the time being.

It's not mine."" I don't usually wear them, but I know for a fact it's not mine because a) I know where all of mine came from, and I've got way too much of an ass (for a white gal) to fit into an x-small. 

I pointed it out to him and he told me he had no idea where it came from. At first, and I said something to the effect of, ""There isn't a thong-fairy that just maliciously drops other women's underwear into our washing machine!"" I was just trying to get the point across that it had to end up in his laundry somehow, but it just ended up being funny. 

I have *never* been suspicious of him before. I didn't even think he knew any women he could cheat on me with. He told me the only place he can think of that the thong came from is one of his sister's. He went to his mom's house the other day to pick up some clothes, but that it really hurt him to know that I thought he would cheat. 

I don't know. I'm at a slight loss here. I'm almost fine with it, so why his mother would be taking care of any of her laundry is beyond me. It's just eating at me now. I love him so much, and until now, I trusted him with anything and everything. 

Part of it hurts because he doesn't even seem to want to pretend to understand why I'm upset about it. He brushes it off like it's completely normal for people to have foreign underwear show up in their laundry baskets.

So I confront her about it and just the usual ""how could you do this to me?"" and she just acts cold and starts turning it into how I made her do it she couldn't talk which I've apologized for constantly. So I forgive her because I do love her and I don't want to lose any time with my son and we try and make it work but I still have this feeling. Fast forward 2 months I go through her phone again and fond that she's still talking to the guy calling him baby and xoxo  and I snap and call her a whole and tell her what a bitch she is since I've been pouring my entire heart out for her which is not an easy thing to do. 

Well now she claims this guy listens and he's her friend and she doesn't see any point in us fixing it because I'll just shut down again even though I show her constantly I'm trying to change for her and my son.

We never really used porn together before

Once he came home things slowly started to change

I'm now trying very hard to make up for everything and turn back into that person.  One of the things he wants is a partner that he can share everything with

I asked if he wanted to get a blowjob while watching porn today as a gesture, but sounded really sad/pissed/upset about it.

He said I'm not a replaceable mouth in this scenario to use as a masturbation device

On my end, I get NOTHING out of it (yet I LOVE giving head when its just the two of us).  He looks more at the porn then he keeps his eyes open with me (so it felt like he can look at porn the whole time while getting off, but can't stare at my naked body while we have sex).  He doesn't look at me, but says that asking to look at me more turns the tables and takes what should be his fap time and makes me selfish and things.

I just, then fuck the crap out of, and have enjoy sharing blow jobs with him while he watches porn.

He cums faster with porn then with me, I feel like its going to be all the other girls that are making him horny, and he's just using my vagina to satisfy his urges he has for other women.

So, or I just pretend and at least he's happy even while I feel used and like shit and like I don't turn him on more then the porn does.

I feel like a fucking prude and a bitch because I don't want any part of him and porn anymore.  I guess it doesn't help because I don't feel like we've ever ""made love"" or had sensual, but he also yawns while fingering me (usually just laying next to me, so not really emotionally connecting at all, he doesn't kiss my body or touch me in any other way then just finger my clit or whatever).  It turns me off and makes me feel aweful, again like he is more aroused/excited by porn then me, so the idea of looking at it with him makes me feel worse.

I was raised by a mentally ill, sent to school filthy, told things from a very young age like 'you'll wake up one of these days and I'll be gone because I'm sick of you' or 'you have everyone fooled, you're a hateful despicable brat.' She did start 'running away' when I was a teen, would blow all the money for bills and every time almost succeeded in killing herself. She's claimed since then that it wasn't really her, that she has 'multiple personalities.'   Truth is, I don't give a damn what she tries to call it, where she sees all bad things in her life as being done to her

The last time I saw her, everything was a month overdue, the rent was due, and my name wasn't on the lease.  I had to lie to everyone that month to keep from being thrown out and homeless.  

My mom went to women's shelters and told them she was running from her abusive daughter.  They wouldn't tell me anything or even listen when I told them she was a danger to herself.  I had the number to a phone she had hidden from me, instead of calling, she just sent endless abusive text messages that kept me permanently on the edge of a panic attack.  I got rid of my phone and haven't talked to her in 6 years.  I suffer from depression and PTSD.

Currently - 

She's now trying to contact me (she found an email of mine).  I know I should be the bigger person and not go off on her and tell her she's fucking worthless, self centered, and should go fuck off - but that's all I want to say to her.  I was thinking maybe she'd changed, but then I saw she was telling people that she doesn't talk to me because ""I ran off because I was embarrassed and humiliated about her religion."" (she's wiccan)  So even today she's making this my fault and herself the victim.  I'm a female who's not prone to violent outbursts, but when I read that I about put my fist through my monitor. 

She's found my sister who was adopted before I was born.  She apparently spoke with her on the phone 5 hours yesterday.  My sister was abused badly in the foster care system, but I'm so terrified at how to tell her our mom is ....not who she's probably portraying herself to her.  I want to let her know all the things she's done to me, tell her that our mom's lying to her about how she ended up being given away into the system, that she's untrustworthy and abusive, that if she'd stayed in our mom's custody her childhood would be pretty much the same except less variety in who was abusing her.  At the same time, I want her to make up her own mind on our mom.  I completely clueless on how to approach this. 

So I guess my question is - how do I handle telling my mom to fuck off?  How do I handle telling my long lost adopted sister our mom is a child abuser?

*Edit* I finally got the courage to read the email my mom sent me.  She basically asked if she had the right email and said she's been looking for me and she found my sister and gave my sister my email. She gave me her married name and current state but no city. Her name's sort of common so I can't find her online (did a fb search).  She signed the email 'i love you""  She has no idea I know she's been telling people I don't talk to her because I'm embarrassed b/c of her religion.  I was thinking of responding with this:

I will talk to her but not to you.  You missed your chances when you walked out on me 5+ times and refused to acknowledge how much you fucked up the first 20 years of my life.  You left.  Leave me alone. 

Is that too harsh? Should I just not say anything?  If I get an email from my sister

Naturally, this 'revelation' would definitely put a strain on our relationship and it would be weird and awkward. The bottom line is things would never be the same. I know I'm being selfish but I just can't lose her.

So I'm thinking of giving this a shot. There isn't that 'spark' between us (not from my side anyway) but she's a beautiful girl and one of the most caring and selfless people I know. She's the only person I can talk to about anything and she knows me through and through and I know her. I'm asking fellow redditors who have been there - is there any chance that I will eventually fall in love with her? Or is this doomed from the start? Will I end up hurting her more than by telling her I don't feel the same way? I really don't know what to do. I don't want to hurt her but at the same time I don't want to lose her.

- If you didn't mesh well
- If one of you was ready for a serious relationship and the other wasn't
- If one of you cheated
- If (insert your heartbreak here)

Why? Because you can only control who you are. You cannot control anybody else. I loved my ex boyfriend and I know in my heart he loved me. But we are two different people living our lives at two different speeds in two very different ways. When he hurt me he didn't set out to do so. He didn't wake up in the morning and think ""I'm going to do this just so I can hurt her."" He did what he did because that is who he is. That is how he reacts and deals with the world around him. It had nothing to do with me. And the same thing applied when I hurt him. 

Example: If he was mad he would ignore me for days. He would flirt with other girls. He eventually cheated on me. But he had also been cheated on in previous relationships. His home life was insecure, much less someone else. And THAT is why we hurt each other. THAT is why it had to end.

The bottom line is: It was not my fault the relationship didn't work. It was not his fault the relationship didn't work. It didn't work because we weren't ready. And taking things personally (""he's doing this just to make me cry"", destroy my self confidence... and make it that much harder to give the next boyfriend the unconditional love he deserves. Only when I grow into the stronger/better/happy/confident woman I'm meant to be will I be able to get the man I dream of.

So bravo

I've been talking to a lot of friends about it, or what they're trying to do themselves is to not be in a relationship.  They say that i'm too young to be tied down, that I should be happy I'm single.  One of my friends just ended a relationship of 3 years, with a girl he didn't have any issues with, because he just didn't want to be tied down. Literally one day later he started hooking up with this other girl who came out of nowhere, because it was easy, and because she didn't want a relationship either.  My friends all tell me i'm young, that I should be happy I don't have to worry about anyone else

Maybe i feel this way since I don't really have anyone who would call me their best friend, and when I did have it, I took it for granted.

But I love having that one person who gives a shit,  I love giving a shit about their problems, feeling needed, that I have power over making them feel better (or worse).  I can't do the whole meet chicks at bars, take them home and fuck them,  It's funny, it's something I always wanted to do in my dreams or fantasies, while this girl was attractive, but I dunno

This friend was also telling me how my judgement is clouded, it's something I long for, because life alone is way more fucking miserable than sharing it with someone.

I may have given up on pretty much all my dreams in return for a safe life, or call up even older exes to try to coax up some feelings again.  but i'm not going to sit back and pretend that being single is awesome, because it fucking sucks, and i'll live it up, i'll get hammered with all my friends and i'll meet chicks and I'll flirt, and i'll enjoy my ridiculous salary, but I don't think that's going to make me happy.  

Maybe even with someone, thats probably what my ex would say, and she may be right, or maybe it was just her I don't know. she left kind of because she didn't feel like she was getting all the shit i'm longing for in this post, and I have no idea why I wasn't her best friend (though she was mine), and I became selfish, and I don't know how i didn't realize it then.

What was initially a few simple bullet points quickly turned into a five page breakdown of proper messaging etiquette

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l5NHwDYZ77I

My response rates online have always been a lot higher than other people I know

I realize this is ""Relationship Advice"" and not ""Unsolicited Relationship Advice""

**EDIT**: *For those people asking for a write up, so I don't have a script for those parts. Other than that, it should be fairly faithful.*

One of the hardest parts of online dating is introducing yourself. Writing that first message to someone you’re interested in can be overwhelming

The bad news is, if we can figure out how to make ourselves stand out from the screaming masses, our chances of meeting a girl we’re actually interested in increase substantially.

But before we talk about what a first message to a girl should look like

The first is “The Check Box”.

Lots of guys do this, and gives her no real incentive to bother reading yours.

The next is “The Rambler”.

Seriously, when you first engage with someone, they aren’t looking for reasons to date you, they’re looking for reasons to NOT date you, and the longer you ramble on, the more chances you’re giving yourself to put your foot in your mouth. So for now, keep it simple.

Finally

I can smell the axe body spray from here. Just don’t be a douche bag. And never, spelling and punctuation. And netspeak is like dating kryptonite. Avoid it at all costs.

Good

1)	It should show that you have read her profile.

If she mentions she likes guys who wear glasses

If she talks about how she’s always wanted to go to japan

If she likes Super Mario Brothers

It doesn’t have to be anything huge

A not so obvious side note is that the thing you mention shouldn’t be so obvious. If a girl mentions that she likes Star Wars on her profile

2)	It should ask an open ended question.

As in, they are going to invest more in that interaction. 

For example: the other day somebody noticed on my profile that I liked the book Heart of Darkness

My response was “yes”.

Now, they would have received a much more well thought out response, and I would have been far more engaged in the conversation. 

3)	It should be light in tone

Here, you should be able to say everything you need to say in 3 to 5 sentences. 3 to 5. That’s it. That’s more than enough time to indicate you’ve read their profile, ask an open ended question and do some light flirting. 

Why so short? Well

One, a good number of the messages you’re going to send out still aren’t going to get responses. Dumping an hour of your life into that perfectly crafted three page introduction is likely to be effort wasted.

Two, give them a good excuse to write you back.

At no point during your first message should you ask for their name

Now, who seemed like a really nice guy. His door is right in front of the only entry/exit to the building. I would always say hi to him, talk to him in passing, about his girlfriend or his kids (older than me) or whatever else came up. Whenever he saw my daughter he'd give her a little piece of candy or let her pet his cat. But we never spent too much time with him, once, early on when we had moved in, my boyfriend and I had dinner over at his apartment because his roommate was a supposedly chef at one of the nicer restaurants in town. However, I mentioned to him that we may be leaving

Today, it was a letter. From my neighbor. It said things in it that made me very uncomfortable. He called me a 'celtic princess', said that ""when he sees me, his grey matter goes out &amp; his knees &amp; thoughts seem to abandon him"". Then he goes on to say: ""Would love to be the one to brush your hair out at night, snuggle you close &amp; slowly kiss you goodnight. Now that you may be leaving I have to get this off my chest."" Along with a few other things, such as that he will miss my daughter when we leave. 

I told my boyfriend about it, he seems pretty harmless. Always thought he was just a nice older man. But I have to walk by his door every day, with my daughter, and he knows that my boyfriend has moved back home with his mom for the time being. I can't help but to worry... I'm unsure about how I should handle this situation. This hasn't been the first time that something similar to this has happened (an unrequited love situation), but I have been told before that people take me being friendly and having conversations or doing small favors (picking something up at the store) when asked to as flirtation.

My dad started seeing his friend which I honestly think is great and he's even moved in with her

I pointed out that always bringing her around was like what my sister did when she first met her boyfriend and reminded him of how he hated that. I also reminded him that I've never made any of my boyfriends' presences a condition of mine. I then let it go and invited him to lunch when I knew she was at work to try to get some time where I could be myself without feeling uptight because a stranger was there. I still saw her 80% of the time I saw my dad and I've always been nice and friendly to her. 

Now on Thursday I asked my dad if we could go see World War Z just the two of us and he agreed to today. He picked the date. This morning I texted him about it and he replied that his phone was acting up. ""I have an appointment at 4:15 and I'll let you know when we are done.""

5 o'clock rolls around: ""We're done.""

My spidey sense was tingling. ""We're?""

""Me and Debbie.""

""Oh

""Yes.""

I told him, but it's been a long time since we did something just the two of us.""

We got in a huge fight after that. He basically told me (again) he wants to spend anytime they both have free with her. He said it would be rude to ask her to stay home. I feel like it was rude for him to invite her to the movie after I made a point of asking for just us. I don't expect her to stay home. She has daughters and a car of her own. She could make plans with them if she wanted to and he explained to her that it was a father-daughter night

Tldr: My dad won't make time for me alone. He always brings his girlfriend.

Edit: Or will some people at least come validate my feelings? I feel awful and lonely right now. Rationally I know it's a bad way to look at it

Edit 2: I've talked to my mom about it and she says she thinks he's afraid to leave Debbie home alone when he knows she's not occupied with work because he's the insecure one and is afraid she'll go out and meet some other guy or something.

Since then I have gotten into weight lifting, physically it's not.

It feels like it is tearing me and the relationship apart from the inside and she has no idea(at least no idea how bad it is) and there is no way for me to tell her directly without hurting her feelings. I even find myself looking at other women who are thinner and it reminds me of how I may never be able to experience having a partner who can turn me on visually like that

We're both in our 20's and I hate how she is allowing herself to go downhill at such a young age. I've tried indirectly helping her get fit but she gives up every time. I almost feel disrespected in the sense that she doesn't care whether she looks good for me or not

1362368735.0,19m8hk,[25/m] I slapped my [21/f] GF last night. ,embarassedthrowaway2,104,38,210,"My girlfriend and I went out last night and I was the designated driver. We get to the party and my girlfriend asks to take the keys to my car so that her and her friends can go in the car to take some shots so they don’t have to pay for drinks at the bar. About 30 minutes later, and I’m usually the forgiving type but I admit

I asked one of her friends if they would be willing to give her a ride home since she rode with me, maybe I was, but before things got out of hand, I really just wanted to remove myself from the situation. 

I asked my girlfriend to follow me to my car so she can grab her stuff and give me my keys. She keeps saying that she is absolutely not going to give me my keys because she does not want to be left alone with no ride back. She also told me that she could not find her phone and that she doesn’t want to leave without her phone. I told her again that I asked our mutual friend and that they would give her a ride home and that I would help her find her phone if she would just give me my damn keys. It just went in one ear and out the other. 

She proceeded to stand by my driver’s side door while I kept asking her for my keys so that she could grab her stuff and I can drive home. She kept saying no while becoming more and more belligerent. She kept repeating that there was no way she was going to give me my keys to my car because she doesn’t want to be left here and that she could not find her phone. I told her again that she has a ride home and that if she gave me my keys, her refusing to give me my keys to my car while acting very belligerent with her eyes glazed over, I just lost control. I completely understand that what I did was wrong. 

She then proceeded to lose her shit. She started kicking me, ripped my shirt, threw my glasses on the ground, all while yelling “How dare you hit me! How dare you hit me!” This lasted about 10 – 15 seconds while I kept telling her to stop while pushing her away from me. Just for reference, I am about 5’11” and 180 pounds and my girlfriend is 5’11” and 160 pounds. It hurt, a lot. My glasses broke and I have scratches across my chest, neck

I then immediately started jogging back towards the venue we were at so I could find our mutual friend so that she could help me resolve this. This whole altercation, I noticed I had two missed calls from our mutual friend and that she was calling to inform me that she and her friend have left and that she assumed that since she could not find me or my girlfriend, that everything was okay. 

I walked back to my car where I found my girlfriend sitting in the drivers seat while grabbing all her stuff and putting it in a trash bag I keep in the car for trash. After a minute or so of me asking her to open the goddamn door

At this point I started video recording everything on my phone. I did not want to be put into a situation where it was my word against hers. She finally gave me my keys and we started to drive home. I honestly do not think I have ever been so emotional ever in my life as I was during the drive home last night. In all honestly, I completely lost it and just started bawling my eyes out. For the next 20 minutes until I could drop her off, she kept repeating that she didn’t have her phone, how she couldn’t believe that I hit her, and how I was a bitch for crying. 

We talked today and she is still acting like she did absolutely nothing wrong. I explained to her and apologized for slapping her but that her actions before and after were not acceptable. After I explained to her actions last night when she was intoxicated and how devastated I was for how she was acting, there is no way in hell that she should have reacted the way she did, she said, “I will do that to any man that hits me… you’re lucky I didn’t do more”.

Some more things she said to me today are

I don’t know what to think or do anymore. I haven’t eaten anything today or left my bed. I’m extremely depressed and devastated at everything. On one side, but on the other hand, I’m hurt by the way she reacted and proceeded to blame everything on me on the ride home. And in addition, our relationship is completely broken. Was I wrong for acting the way I did? I already apologized to her but she keeps blaming me and I don’t know what to do. 

tl:dr GF got drunk, held my keys / cars hostage, I wrongly reacted and slapped her, she proceeded to retaliate. Confused and don't know how to feel or what to do anymore.

This is going to be lengthy. Stay with me.

So, ""we need to talk,"" yet no actual talking has happened. I am at wits end.

Background: We initially started dating when I had just freshly turned 21. I was an ass and she broke up with me. She gets married to an abusive prick, spare clothes, phone, etc. They are still not officially divorced.

About 5 years after we had broken up initially

She eventually gets a job. I am stoked. She breaks up with me two months later, wants time to herself. I get it. Start to move on with my life. A month or so later we hook up again. (It's meant to be at this point, yes?) 

With no income, I let this girl move back in with me. At this point I am paying for her phone ( I was dumb and put her on my account 6 months after we had first gotten together again), paying the rent and electricity for the apartment we shared, buying groceries, buying smokes, buying booze, etc.

Fastforward to about 5 weeks ago: She went to her sister's house (allegedly) and hasn't come back. For the first few weeks she would text me every now and then, she has stopped responding to my texts and calls. 

Fun part: I am still paying for our shared phone bill, but it's hard to move on with no response. I don't want to just toss all of her shit out, but it's almost gotten to that point. I am having trouble proceeding from here. I'm not sure if I should try to play nice and be an adult about this, or light everything she still owns on fire.

My ex and i mutually broke off our relationship last year.  I just couldn't get along as a couple so we decided to call it quits before things got ugly.

About 3 months ago my ex wanted to meet up and become friends again.  We did and it was a good time.  We have genuine fun together.  I eventually introduced her to my current roommate and our friends circle.  I started to get old feelings back and this make things a bit awkward when she was around. I slowly got more and more uncomfortable about her being around. This was accelerated when she started coming to the bars with us.  (~3 weeks ago) She has always been kinda flirty with everyone while she's drunk.  It's just her personality.  I did give warning that I would be very uncomfortable if she ended up sleeping with one of my friends.  She promised she won't do anything and that I had nothing to worry about.  I told the same thing to the roommate not long after.  The flirtation escalates.

Jump to one week ago.  Her, and I go to the bars and get tispy.  The two are all over each other and I am so disgusted that I leave.  Making a scene isn't really my thing.  I opted to send the ex a lengthy text telling what was up and saying I was no longer cool with her hanging out with my circle of friends.  I had no reason to believe that they were doing anything or that I held any animosity towards here.  Just a clear message to stay away becuase I need distance.  They both assure me the next day that nothing happened. 

Two days ago I found out what really happened.  My roommate dropped the bombshell.  The two made out for the first time after I left the bars.  Since, EX and I are going to start dating and we've been seeing each other for the past week.""  That was pretty much it and he leaves to go see her.  It hit me hard.  I am internally outraged, but i keep my cool.  I tell him to never, under any circumstances, talk about her in my presence or bring her anywhere near our apartment.

To clarify.  I had my suspicions all along
  
I've been kind of sick to my stomach the last two days rolling the idea of them in bed together. 

Any advice would be appreciated.  Thanks

Wall of text.... Sorry...

The big one, I've been told that I'm a slut. I own it because I hate the stigma of that word and never use it myself, but I sleep around when I'm single. I enjoy all sorts of sex, positions, toys, whatever, I'll try it. I always do my best to make sure mutual orgasms are had, I absolutely love going down on her so it's not really an issue.

The issue is that the only position she's willing to have sex in is missionary. She's 5'5"" and weighs 115lbs, but because I get tired being on top the whole time! On a purely sexual, objectifying note, she's gorgeous and has a beautiful body that I want to be able to look at when we're having sex!

My favourites position is doggy style.. I suspect I'm not alone in this, but she also said once when she was drunk that doggy style is 'gross'. No other explanation offered... I know she's had some abusive relationships in the past, physical and emotional, and I suspect that part of it is this reason.
The hurting her bit I can work around, or even if I should try...

Truth be told

Anyway, a large man took offense and tried to beat me up, and the cops were called.  I was the one who wasn't the regular and the cops listened to the majority.  I made them look stupid and busted out my video phone - that shit works on them, actually (smart, right?  no - not smart, douchey).

Anyway, with its throwaway accounts.  Literally, I found myself laughing hysterically, downtown last night, on a sidewalk, watching fat tears fall from my eyes.

I know the whole delete Facebook (never had one), and lawyer up (good advice).

I know I'm rambling

My dogs love both of us.  My old dog, however, and can make her way around the house.  That has to change, obviously, since things will change.  My MAJOR problem is that my wife and I will not be together anymore.  So the older dog will be dealing with new surroundings, her boss's boys (not the calmest or ""nicest"" kids), and won't have me.  Honestly, but also loves my wife.  The younger dog loves both of us

What do I do?  I'm dying here

Honestly, I'll swing by somone's house.""  I don't know anybody.  

And you know what?  I went downtown.  We have churches.  I'm agnostic.  But I wanted a fucking chapel to sit in.  I didn't realize churches locked their doors.  In some small town in the Midwest they do, I guess.  It's a shame they have to lock them.

1362146947.0,19gnke,(43f) married to (42m) and in love with best friend (34f)? Very confused.,anonbunnies,96,29,62,"I've known and loved ""Jane"" for 15 years. She is beautiful, abuse of every kind, praise. Maybe even more physically affectionate than most people would consider normal for friends.

I've been married for 17 years to Joe. Rough times. Good times. I can honestly say the last two years have been the best in our marriage. Very solid sex life. 

I've never had physical attraction to females. Never kissed another woman in a  way. Ive had a lot of sexual partners - maybe two dozen? Always loved sex. Adventurous. Bold. I'm pretty open to new things. There ar e a few women celebrities I think are hot

Jane has never had a consensual sexual relationship. Never. She has several terminal diseases. One disease is AIDS. Has had them for eight years. She's pretty healthy right now

 Mentally she's learned so much, but is in love with me and has been for many years. 

I'm not afraid. I'm not dismayed. I'm not disgusted. What I am is confused. About me

Can you love someone so completely that gender just doesn't matter? Because that's what it feels like.

 Joe has thought for years that Jane was in love with me. I may have been too naive to think there was a sexual component or the type of love didn't matter to me. It just ""was"". Joe always said what happens between me and Jane, is our business. He knows I love him and desire him. He loves Jane too, always has. He even said once that if I could give her the love she needs I should, because she's not going to be with us forever and he wants her to have every chance at happiness. He said what Jane and I have isn't threatening to him, he wouldn't consider it cheating. But i wonder if he'd want to know. I don't like to lie or withhold the truth. And there are multiple STI risks. 

And Damn it. I wasn't going to disclose it yet but it happened last night. She kissed me. I kissed her back. We have always cuddled and held hands at times but this was amazing. Hours of being so close and if she was a man there absolutely would have been sex. I know that sounds hopelessly hetero but I'm telling you if there had been man parts involved I would have lost my mind completely. Except she wouldn't have done it because of the illnesses.  I can't deny I love her in every way possible. And even though I don't find women in general sexually appealing

 So I'm stuck. I don't feel like I can tell Joe without it being a betrayal of Jane. Joe already gave it the green light because he always suspected it would happen one day.  Jane loves me too much to put me at risk so things won't go beyond a safe level.  And I'm beginning to believe in my heart and soul that gender is inconsequential and love is love, yet it never changed my relationship with Joe. 

Any words of wisdom out there for me?

So
After a week or so of weird chats with her, we met. Everything was pretty good. It was like nothing really happened. She was happy and all smiley. Let's make this shorter. There was nobody home except for her when I got there. I really didn't have any intentions after what happened last time. But apparently her mind changed a lot from the last time. She hugged me and started to kiss me and put my hands on her ass. I guessed that it was a green light for me. Anyways. We watch Fight Club and then had some dinner. When I was about to leave, she tells me that she wanted me to spend the night there because it's dangerous, and it was raining. To what I said yes, why not. I told her that I was gonna take a shower. To what she said ""Wait for me"". My heart literally stopped in that moment. We showered together and then we went to bed. We started to kiss each other. Turned the lights off (her mom was sleeping) and we had sex. It was beautiful. After what I thought were 10 minutes (but were actually 4 hours), she had an orgasm and screamed pretty loud. Her mom got up and saw both of us on bed. Although she didn't say anything, I think that is the last time I would be able to go there. She went to her room and we both went to sleep. 
I have no idea what happened to her. But she seems like a different person. In part I have to say thanks to you all. This is all thanks to the advice of many of you.

Update: additional info to answer everyone's questions.
I have known my husband for 11 years. My husband and I were best friends from age 14 to age 19 when we started dating. I had a child from a previous relationship the same year we started dating, both boys, who just happen to have autism. We have been together for 6 years in total, but just recently finally got married in August of this year (we weren't delaying the marriage for any specific reason). We also moved 2hrs away from our home town 2 years ago. So stress: we have no time to be a couple to ourselves, we are away from everyone we know, and our kids have autism; with the oldest the autism is a minor issue but our youngest is nonverbal and severely delayed, so he has hours upon ours of therapy a day, and I spend a large part of my time being CEO of his life. The household chores argument comes in when my husband doesn't think he has to help out because he works, yelling in front of the kids

I like all of the joking comments, and also because he knew it would make me absolutely livid. He was awake, and admitted to doing it, but I'm so disgusted and mad that I haven't even asked for the explanation. I sent him resources from a counseling book, and supposedly he is going to look for help. I'm concerned that it won't work. Of course I knew that this was not normal behavior; just wanted some ideas through the eyes of outsiders. Thanks everyone! 

Update 2: I asked him why he did it, probably snoring. How was that sexual?"" He said ""Your butt looked really good. And I knew it was stupid right when I was done. It wasn't meant to make you mad. I know I shouldn't be doing anything sexual that you don't invite."" 

I reiterated to him that this could be considered sexual assault, and I will be installing a lock on my door to use when I am feeling uncomfortable. :/ ",,False,,t5_2r0cn,1351041376.0,,

Anyway, that if I were to make a move it would result in potential awkwardness.  We get along so well, that there is absolutely no sexual tension. Anyway, after we went out on Friday I accepted that. Even though I accepted the fact that we would probably never be together, I still can't help but have feelings for her. We get along so well, I don't think I've ever connected with someone the way I connected with her. 

So here comes Saturday night, I'd rather just not be around her for the time being. After the cookout my friends and I go out to the bar, she drives separately and meets us there. After the bar, she goes home with my best friend and he closes the deal according another friend of mine that was also staying at his house.  I'm supposed to go on a trip with my best friend this weekend, plane tickets already purchased. 

I'm really trying to get over this. I'm telling myself that it wouldn't work out between her and I anyway

Last paragraph: My friend texted me today and asked if I wanted to meet up after work to get food and discuss the details of our trip.  All of the details have already been worked out so there is really nothing to discuss in regards to that. He knew that I had been talking to this girl before he hooked up with her on Saturday night. He's done this type of thing before except it was with another friends long time girlfriend (shortly after they broke up).  So in regards to meeting with him after work; I believe that he wants to discuss what happened and probably apologize. 

Can anyone please provide some input here? I'm kind of lost and feel like shit about everything right now.

I always thought I could count on him to love me the way I am because that was always the impression he gave me. It wasn't until recently that he started making these comments. He knows that last one bothered me. He tried to explain that he likes the way I am now

This is a throwaway account. And a story of madness. And love. And trust.
Alright
I guess I could start with some info about me. I’m a quite normal male in my thirties, fair, view on women nonetheless. Was a bitter cunt tho for awhile, I got over it.

Now, but things just clicked. To say the least, this woman is the one I want to marry and get kids and a dog with. Sure, been in love with the ones before her but not like this. We just went into this punch-drunk love-mode. For me, it’s the only person I’d like to bare myself for, the only friend I want to spend my entire day with, and the only one I have the focus and interest in knowing entirely. Now, wtf why are you baring yourself now then?”. Well, and can only meet a couple of times a month for the time being.

So, lets leave it at that. And all of a sudden they are friends on facebook. And all of a sudden she brings him up. Like a lot. Like every day. Like every other topic we have is about him. So I ask her if she shouldn’t focus a bit more on us and tone it down. She wonders why this is so much of a problem. I tell her I don’t care about the guy at all. She’s says they are friends. After talking for a week. She tells me how he tells her that he feels so depressed. I tell her I’ve heard that story before. She tells me he wanted to come visit her, but since they are quite far from eachother aswell although living in the same area he needs to spend the night. I say nope. Now, for a guy whose been through quite a few things, this is starting to screw with my head. She wonders why I can’t trust her. I question his motives. She has a cup of coffee with the guy anyway. So she comes and visits me two weeks ago and she tells me she has broken connection with him since he had said that “she deserves to be with someone better then me, that my job is shit and I am stupid” and she wouldn’t tolerate that. So, I’m kinda relieved and relaxed by this, as he clearly has shown his motive. A couple of more days go by, and it all goes haywire. To say the least, I’m madly in love with this woman even though I can’t understand how she thinks and reasons. 

Alright, since she felt lonely. And she spent two days there and slept in his bed. She says she loves me, and I believe and trust her, since it would drive me mad otherwise. Also nothing happened between them. And now as she was about to go to bed, she tells me he’s coming over to sleep there, since he felt angsty. So he’s there right now when I write this and that feels fucking great. And all this time she says she tries to make this easy on me, considering my past. And that it has been my behavior, and has been unreasonably jealous. When it comes to myself, texting and calls. So, I’d lie if I say that this doesn’t take it’s toll on my energy and patience. 

My question is; Am I a fucking idiot

Thanks for your time

Long story short, and still do, just not romantically.

Basically while we were dating (and prior to that) I was struggling with an alcohol-problem. Every time my boyfriend tried to bring it up I got defensive and told him he's not the person that can say what I need to change. Everyone around us noticed my problem as well and talked shit behind my back and just generally disliked me.

Eventually we broke up because I was simply not in love anymore. For some reason the breakup was also a wakeup call for me and I realized my ex was right all along. I immediately gave up drinking, volunteer at places, etc.

Everyone is noticing my positive change and I get complemented on it daily. The thing is

Hell, my ex got ""bullied"" out of a party saying he's a bad influence on me and that I was the reason for my alcoholism.

This really hurts me because every single bit about that is a lie. He is the most amazing guy a girl could wish for and he tried constantly to help me even when I got defensive and even started violence against him sometimes.

Title basically sums up the quick bits. I'm not good at explaining my feelings


We met about a month ago at a cocktail party I hosted



LEAD UP
------------------


We started chatting and seemed to have tonnes in common, same attitude. We talked a lot about my being gay, she is also bi so we talked about her past relationships with women. That's all that really happened at the party, but we continued chatting over facebook and texts. 


A week later we went to a party togethor, how I'm atracted to the female form but don't think I could do anything with it, how she feels about men, etc. At one point we  moved to the couch and just listened to music in the dark until 4:30am, then she went to sleep on my couch and i went to bed. 


The next day was pretty normal, then she went home.


At this point we started chatting more through texts, but she responded with ""that just mean we can pickup togethor :) "". 


We scheduled a bike ride togethor for this past friday and continued to chat throughout the week. 



FEELINGS!
---------------------------------------------


This is about where I started to realize I had  feelings for her. She continually left little comments in her texts that made me feel she was flirting. I asked myself if It was possible for a gay male to fall in love with a woman. I asked some close friends for advice on the matter and they encouraged me to explore these feelings. I started to get so worked up over this that I stopped eating and sleeping. I didn't eat for two days


Suddenly thursday this girl mentions that she is in town and asks what my plans are for the night. We schedule to meet at my place and go out for a drink



ADMITTION
--------------------------------


We never got out of my place, I think she was trying to get a grip on exactly what type of feelings. She asked me what my reaction would be if she stripped all her clothes off right there, would it be a negative or positive one. I said I wasn't sure. (I later clarified this by explaining that my brain was telling me it would be wrong to be attracted, but the rest of my body was all like ""hells yea""). She professed that she had wanted to kiss me when we were drunk but hadn't, that she found me mature, smart, funny


We settled on the couch and started to watch a movie (Bridges of Madison County) and briefly talk while it was playing. We continually made eye contact and slowly moved towards each other. At one point she asked what time she should leave


When she left we hugged for ages. 



THE PRESENT WHERE I ASK FOR ADVICE
---------------------


We talekd through text the next day while I was at work. I said I would have kissed her but the wine had made my mouth dry


I called her later yesterday and we talked some more, while I said I wasn't sure. 


I think it was stupid of me to say that, adventure and companionship with her, I want her to be a part of my life and I want there to be an US. I want her. 


Now the scary part, or god forbid a stage beyond that, I won't know what to do, or will do it so badly that I scare her off. I'm not sure how slowly I should be going or  how seriously she is taking me. If I start doing the usual romantic stuff, will she be scared off? When I am not with her, my brain just starts doubting everything. She's all I think about. Maybe she is only interested in friendship, can I handle that? WHAT IS SHE INTERESTED IN? OH god. 


EDIT: also as an addendum

Here's the thing.  I don't know what I'm doing.  I don't know what she's expecting or really what I'm expecting.  It's always made sense to me that two people get to know each other and start liking each other *before* dating.  This ""dating from scratch"" stuff feels hopelessly ambiguous and confusing with much room for jumbled expectations.  

So I'm half ranting, how will I know if she wants to be kissed?  How early does that happen?  Will she expect it by the third date or anything like that?  I'm really not that concerned about getting kissed/laid, so I'm willing to work on her schedule, but how do I know what that is?

TL;DR - I find dating a strange and intriguing phenomenon.  How do I do it?  How do I know she's interested?  How do I know if she wants to be kissed and what are usual timetables for that?  What dating is?

EDIT: Also, but I don't want to turn her off by the fact.

**EDIT 2:** Wow, but I have a new question about that.
**New question:** I like everything about this girl but don't feel incredibly infatuated, etc..  Am I supposed to feel that by now and is continuing to date leading her on?  Would kissing her lead her on?  If I feel more comfortable not kissing yet/want it to have more romance behind it, should I?  My sister says maybe I should just stick with holding hands for a while if I'm not sure I'm romantically interested.  Then again, we both tend to be on the conservative side with this stuff.

I really do love her and care about her, because honestly she is a great girl despite her emotional issues.  and i guess i needed to learn how to give tough love.  Now's a good a time as any.  She knows that she'll have a hard time finding a guy as good as me and I guess this is a good reminder.

1295836898.0,f7tcz,GF mad because I said I wouldn't buy her a car if I had the money.,throoooowwwwawayyaya,111,41,176,"I've been seeing this girl for a few months and officially dating her for a few weeks. She comes from a family where it's just her and her mom...and whoever her mom seems to be dating at the time. Throughout her entire life, having the mom and gf move in with them

A little background on the mom: very traditional, and ""*thinkers*"" while women are the ""*feelers*"" mentality. She actually said that. Also, she says I'm a girl because I don't agree with this dynamic. 

While I don't think my gf is exactly the same

So, my gf and I were talking about her mom and cars or something, and I said that I would never buy my gf a car. I see it as wasteful spending and I'd rather use the money for something else, like a trip. My gf stayed pretty quiet, so I asked what was wrong and she kinda went off on me, saying that its not right that I wouldn't buy her a car if she needed one. WTF, yo? 

I tried to explain that money has a utility value, saying that I believe the dollar is better spent on this rather than that. She didn't get it. So, naturally, she tells her mom about our conversation, and the mom responds with, ""the writings are on the wall"", and goes into how this is just another example of how Im feminine, saying that it's ok that I'm like that because thats how I was raised. I tried explaining to her my utility concept and how I believe the money for a car would be better spent on a trip or few, i dont fucking know. Anyway

TL;DR: gf is mad that, and says that it translates into me not willing to be there for her and take care of her.

So a big thanks to kwb58 for checking in on this again... here's where things stand now.

We continued to go to therapy together... the therapist we were seeing turned out to be really terrible.  During one session I said I felt like the two of them were ganging up on me, chances are you're a pretty bad therapist to begin with...)

Anyway, really good therapist.  We had a couple of sessions with him, and we started to address some of the underlying issues.  I could see a seed of how we might be able to work through this.

Then, as a society, rethink what it means to be faithful.).  My friends all took it as her saying ""Look, what I did wasn't so bad!"".  She sent this to, among other people, my best friend, his wife, and my mother.  I confronted her about it

The next thing that happened really killed any chance of us working things out-  We had a joint cell phone account, and she wouldn't tell me who it was, and all she would tell me was that she was flirting with someone.  Keep in mind, I told her very explicitly that if we were going to work things out, neither of us were to start seeing anyone.

So that was what really did it for me-  I just didn't see how the hell I could put this back together when she was acting like that;  I felt that at every turn

So after that, and we could talk to each other like people again.  My landlord was really awesome and reduced my rent in exchange for moving into a different unit, and in the separation agreement, my wife was pretty good about letting me keep the majority of things.  

She has made several comments to me that ""we're just separated"" and ""we don't have to get divorced"", like I can focus on myself instead of her.  I'm seeing my own therapist, and I've made it a point to focus on my feelings post-separation, and although I have had some really bad moments, for the most part I feel like I am coming out the other end already, and I'm a better person for it.

That brings us up to now-  Last week I asked a girl out on a date-  a friend of a friend that I met at a BBQ.  We had a really great time together, but all in all, I feel good about going out and meeting new girls.  

Again-  I wanted to thank everyone here for all the comments and support they gave me in the last two threads... there was some good discussion here,False,,t5_2r0cn,False,,,t3_cct2k

I am a 29/m who is a novice with relationships. I have been happy on my own until this point but I decided to see what was out there and met someone through an online dating site. She, went out on a date, came back to my place and cuddled up on the couch, got intimate and generally had a lot of fun. When time came for her to get home, she got very emotional and teary. I asked her what was wrong and she said she was a bit overcome with how she felt about me and didn't want to leave. Then she told me she loved me. Now, I like this girl a lot and enjoy spending time with her but this was too much too fast for me. Even so, I had just finished consoling her and telling her she was special and I liked her and when she said she loved me I panicked. I didn't know what to say and didn't want to leave that just hanging and I said I loved her too. I know I shouldn't have said it without actually feeling it but I was caught off guard and it just happened. So now I feel like we are getting way too serious way too fast for me. I absolutely do not want to hurt this girl but I also feel like I have to be honest and I can't let her keep thinking I am in love with her if I am not. I am really stuck on where to go from here. How do I let her know I think we are getting serious too fast? How do I tell her I only said 'I love you' because she surprised me and caught me off guard? Should I get out of the relationship if she if feeling so serious so fast and I am not? Any advice would be so welcome.

**tl;dr**-- She said I love you too fast and I said it back without meaning it. Where do I go from here?

Update: We talked briefly on the phone and I laid out that I felt we were moving to fast and the 'I love you' came out because she said it and I didn't know how to respond. She was a little upset but we agreed to get together tomorrow for dinner and talk more in depth about how we both feel about the relationship and how to move forward if she is feeling more strongly than I am. I want to thank everyone that replied with kind words and advice. Hopefully I can clearly lay out my concerns and she can understand and accept them but if not I suppose I am prepared to break things off.

1367847126.0,1dshbo,Husband took out a loan without telling me...just found out and not sure how to deal.,Poptarta,80,17,38,"So bare with me. My husband and I have been married for 3 years. We have joint accounts and share everything. An investment deal recently came our way and he really wanted to do it. I didn't really want to because we have some credit cards I wanted to pay off first. After much arguing we decided that we would invest with the savings we have. I guess he didn't feel that that was significant amount because he went to the bank and got a line of credit so he could invest more. I found out after he had done the deal because he said he transferred some of his credit card debt to a new line of credit he got. That alone was shocking but then when I asked why he didn't transfer all of it (lower interest rate) he fessed up. Now I don't trust him and don't know what to do. I love him but I honestly don't want to be married to him right now. 

TLDR: husband took out a loan for an investment behind my back.

Edit: So the amount although not huge was in the thousands. The money isn't really the important thing. The investment is a kick starter type thing that pays dividends. Either way if it is good or bad nothing changes. Separating our finances is definitely happening regardless of if I stay or go.

So, but it's just really hard for me to be encouraging when she's so hard on herself. The second and less important part is how to help her feel sexier about herself again. I still think she's beautiful, and I think most men would agree. I just want to help her realize that.

I still ended it though. we talked for a few hours and she told me the truth about everything. i didnt tell her I lurked her facebook the night of  just that i did a week ago when i saw the other stuff and then she told me she hung out with him that night and what happen.  all is good i guess.  thank you all for the help. I will keep you posted if anything else happens 

Ok this is a relativly long story. I apologize now for any grammar or spelling mistakes

About a week ago I log onto Facebook on my Gaming/Video Editing computer (a computer i don't normally use facebook or anything for that matter) and i see a new message from a guy with some flirting going on. I quickly realize its not my facebook but my girlfirned left her facebook logged in. I begin to read more since the conversation is somewhat dirty and explicit. There is mention of hanging out (ok fine whatever


(sorry for the wall)

Anyway flash forward to right now, washed up now im going to go to bed good night!"" very strange. So i go on my other PC and check her facebook ( i feel horrible for doing this, i feel like i am envading her privacy) (i dont do it regularly this is probably the third time since the accident) And i see that he is giving her directions to his house and she is crrently walking there and plans for a massage and a movie)  so as of right now  she is ""sleeping"" and i am here panicing/freaking out  what the fuck do i do?  I know i have to break up wtih her, but how? when? Do i tell her i invaded her privacy?

edit:  I know lots of relationships the couples hang out with the oposit sex alone

Edit2: ok so i checked her messages again just now and she is home. she sent him a message saying ""im sorry"" one hour ago. he responded with ""haha its ok"" her: "" i feel so dumb!"" him: ""lmfaoooo"" her: ""dont even make fun. hey nice tweet a hole. just gunna ignore me now? lol"" 

So it looks like maybe she felt guilty and left? maybe during a sexual act? Idk. i could just be paranoid. 

Edit3: going to try and sleep or read or something. Have to work tomorrow. still unsure on how i am going to approach this.  What i do know for sure is this relationship is over.  Thank you for the help. More advice is welcome and I will update you as more happens.

""Here's the thing. When i first talking with you, is you being a little heavier. Maybe it is a shallow thought, but that's just how i feel. I love you as a person and always will. I just wish you were smaller. I think that may have been a problem in previous encoutners when you think i'm trying to hide you or w/e. I didn't hide you consiously. I've just always been interested in smaller, skinnier girls. I think i tried to hint at it before, but dunno if you got it. I've also been trying to be healthier for myself and for you.

Whenever I have a dream about throwitallawayornot cheating or something I am usually mad at him for a couple of days even if he didn't do anything. 


Anyways, it was almost like I was looking for it, wanting it. I would walk past him and touch his shoulder. Or hand him something and hold onto his hand an extra second. Like I was egging him on. Daring him to do something about it. What the fuck.


The entire time I was taking this attention and almost using it against throwitallawayornot. Like throwitallawayornot isn't soft like that with me. He isn't cute. He isn't romantic. And that's not what I was seeing when  I was seeing xxxx. The other night I was wanting throwitallawayornot to leave the room so I could lock eyes with him more. 


And I know he wants it too. That's what is hard as well because I know I am messing with his head when I am doing these things to him. I am only making things more difficult for their relationship


He and I were talking online about things and I mentioned one thing about throwitallawayornot and he flips and stops talking to me. That is weird.


The truth is that if I wasn't completely, I would probably be interested in him. He is smart, he has a cool job, his family is great, I love his sense of style and he has a huge birthmark that actually kind of turns me on. So overall, he is an amazing guy, he deserves a rad chick that can care about him as much as he will care about her. but that is not me. throwitallawayornot is the best thing that has happened to me in a long time and I am not willing to let that go. He really is my other half. 


At other times I almost fantasize about just escaping burlington and going to NY on a whim, crying because I can't believe I actually did it. I knock on the door and he opens it and takes me in his arms. We have that perfect kiss again... and again... and again... I lock him into his room and have him to myself for hours. He hasn't been with that many people so I know I would be taking control and that turns me on just thinking about it. 


But then its all over and I know I would always end up back with throwitallawayornot. He is the love of my life.""


So there you have it. After talking to her

2) Perhaps sensing my disappointment at his ill-fated anniversary dinner plans, in anticipation, I went out an bought him a somewhat expensive gift costing around $100 (expensive for my meager salary, anyway). His gift? A $15 dollar purse that he bought from Walmart. On Christmas eve. With me in store with him, so he tried to hide it underneath the other things we were buying. 

If you can't envision my disappointment, she tells you she totally meant to call her friend but forgot and gives you a half-hearted handjob during which she is fully clothed and then falls asleep on the couch.

He has good intentions which is nice and all but shit

Am I being unreasonable here? If so,,False,,t5_2r0cn,False,,True
1271038493.0,bpkpv,How do I deal with my very unhygienic boyfriend?,dirtybf,86,22,168,"I've been seeing my boyfriend now for 6 months are so. Things are okay between us

In point form:

- He goes several days (I've seen him go upwards to 4) without showering or changing clothes. This wouldn't be so bad if he stayed at home in his cave, out with friends or with me, etc) without making the slightest effort to clean up. Aggravating this is the fact that I've seen him brag about this to his friends. No one, nowhere, should be proud of the fact that they haven't showered in a week.

- He never brushes his teeth voluntarily

- He has a bad eating disorder, as he does not eat for very long periods of time, and it seems like the lack of saliva production only aggravates the festering in his mouth.

- As a result of him not showering for long periods of time, has killed what little remained of our sex life.

- He is someone who is in the camp of ""I don't use deodorant because I don't want to corrupt my cells with the chemicals""

Granted I suppose the latter could be worse

By no means am I a germophobe or a clean freak, I don't think I'm too out of place in expecting a level of hygiene that would let me get close to him without gagging. 

It's gotten to the point where I can't kiss him anymore on most days

I've tried being subtle about it (""I'm done in the shower, I've tried being a bit more overt (""I put out some towels and your toothbrush so you can get ready for bed""), but nothing's worked. 

Should I just tell him bluntly ""hey you always smell and taste disgusting. Take a shower and learn to brush your teeth more than once a week"". I suppose I'm too shy to say such a thing as I don't want to make him mad.

So

**edit:** Neither he nor I are fat and/or ugly. Apart from his hygiene issues

My wife and I aren't happy.  We've both said we feel like two adults just babysitting three children instead of being the happy couple we used to be.  A few years back my job really picked up and I started to work more and more.  I would be at the office for upwards of 70 hours a week.  It started to strain on her.  I would come home tired from work and not wanting to do anything.  We talked for a very long time and I turned a corner.  I came home on time, cooking, cleaning, dishes, laundry, beds, don't get me wrong.  And yes, it was time for her to go out and me to do everything.  I would be gone for 8 hours and the house would be exactly like it was when I left.  I'm not talking spotless.  I'm talking about food that was spilled on the floor.  Garbage overflowing.  Kids still dirty from being outside.  Wrappers from everything all over.  She had not gone out with the kids, she was in the bedroom laying down.  She didn't get up to say hi, I would be taking care of the house and kids.  She took everything I said as a ""I'm the king of the castle

Two big details play into this.  

First, and we actually got a house very close to my work (so things like coming home for lunch are doable).  I rarely work more than 40 hours a week but when I do I at least get overtime (I didn't in my last job  where I worked 70 hours a week).  Unfortunately, it was in another state.  I know this is a **huge** impact on the stress in our lives but all these problems existed before our move.

Second is our dead bedroom.  Things changed after our first child.  She lost interest.  Even the thought about having sex seemed to be a turn off.  In a heated debate about this topic two years ago she even said she only had sex with me the year before just to get pregnant.  We've made love twice this year and only 4 times in the last two months.  I know we're not rabbits anymore but we're only 30.  To go five months without being able to make love to my wife is hard.  And sadly

Am I doing something wrong?  I decided to reach out here because we both agreed to see a marriage counselor and kind of hit our final straws.  Plus

Long time Redditor

I have been with my GF for over 4 years and we have grown to have a very nice life together. At first she was the one that loved and poured more into the relationship but then I slowly came around and did the same. Last year in October I felt things slipping between us. I cant explain the feeling but I just knew in my gut something was up. Sure enough she was seeing a guy from her work behind my back. She claims nothing happened but I do not believe that for a second. To make a long story short she said she cut it off and let him know that they can only be friends as she wants a life with me (something that I truly believe). She claims that he has major problems in his life and that she is just being a good friend. FYI this is the kind of person that she is so I had no reason to disbelieve. I also am not a jealous person and can deal with her having male friends etc. as 90% of my friends are attractive females.  Anyway I told her I could forgive and live with that on one condition. She was not to be with him alone in his house or hers.... period.

Well I went out with some friends on Friday night and on my way home at 3:30 am decided to stop by her place which is normal for us. I get into the building and look in the parking lot to see a strange car parked in her space. I call her phone

We have talked for the last 2 days about what happened. She insists that nothing was going on. She tells me that I was out of my mind
 
I haven't slept more than an hour since Friday night. I am horrified at my own actions (I am usually a calm &amp; rational person). I am angry that she lied to me, I am depressed, confused..broken.

**T:** you see all the people that need new homes...fun people man

**R:** Do what?
 
**T:** brair and all them just got evicted
they have to be out in 30 days

**R:** Dude I am chill where I'm at and it's not a good time financially for me to move. As my friend you should respect and understand that
 
**T:** you could find a cheaper spot

**R:** But it's not a good time for me financially. Burning man is about to smoke check me and I'm going to need time to recover from that.
 
**T:** you will have yer $1000 deposit to you the day you move out
or maybe even before
you can have $$$

**R:** If you guys need a new moving situation so bad you should start looking for a new place I don't know what else to tell you. For me this is not a good time and as my friend you should be understanding and respect that. I think it's really really lame that you aren't considering my situation at all in this. I have always done everything I can to be a homie to you. I sent you 70 dollars worth of stuff in jail
And I would never want to move in with people who just got evicted

**T:** it has nothing to do with any of that
 
**R:** Then what am I missing what is so urgent?
 
**T:** it has to do 100% with what kind of roommate you are
the location is great fer white gurl and i...as an adult you should respect that...we use the gym
you do nothing with the location
what is your situation? exactly?
 
**R:** I also love me place that has nothing to do that.
 
**T:** how about you take the $1000 room again
ya know
 
**R:** Don't be shitty.
 
**T:** why do you love it? you never leave your room
i'm not begin shitty
 
**R:** It doesn't matter how I use my living space wtf are you talking about

**T:** you have no reason to want to stay there
you use none of the amenities in the area
 
**R:** Besides that I love the location. You aren't going to talk me out of loving my apartment.
 
**T:** you stay in yer room all the time and play online
what do you love about it?
the view out of your window?

**R:** That's a stupid way to go about this conversation Anthony
 
**T:** you are being difficult for no reason Rob
as your friend
i will help you look fer a new place
 
**R:** You are asking for me to inconvenience the hell out of myself for you and your only reason why is ""because you don't even like it."" No I do like it. I'll move out when I can. I can't afford to move October 1. It's too quick. My unemployment is out and I'm waiting on scholarship money. If you want me out that fast you can pay me my security deposit plus some extra to help me handle bills. Other than that I can't do it that soon.
Or you guys may find a new place to live October 1 if that date is so huge to you.
 
**T:** i would like you out asap

The conversation went on but nothing of note was said. So tonight when he gets home from work around 6 or 7 we are going to sit down and discuss this. I honestly don't see how i could remain living here without making it a huge deal which i don't want to do. Any advice for the conversation tonight guys? I mostly just thought i owed everyone an update after all the great advice i got the other day.

My (F47) husband (M48) of 25 years has a running buddy (F35) that totally creeps me out. ""Larissa"" was one of ""Gerald's"" graduate students. She has since quit the program and is attending another university online. Gerald and Larissa started running together about a year ago and have developed a friendship that my gut feeling says is over the line. 

They Facebook and text regularly, how hard it is to be unemployed, being halfway across the country from family and single-parenting two (admittedly adorable) little girls. Nothing terribly inappropriate, just weirdly often, weirdly personal contact.

Shortly after they started running

There is something a wild-eyed, ugly, *very* ugly divorce. She IS fragile. She really is depressed and anxious. The very best thing for her would be to maintain all of her friendships, keep adding new ones AND keep running to help with the stress.  I think she stimulates Gerald's desire to be a white night and ""save"" a damsel in distress. She actually kind of makes *me* want to take her under-wing and mother her, too. I am NOT unsympathetic to her plight. I just don't want MY husband saving her. 

This is the first time in the 27 years we have been together that I have had a gut feeling like this about someone threatening my marriage, f19, m13). My intuition has warned me about dangerous situations, health issues, shenanigans they shouldn't be getting up to. I trust the gift of fear. 

It's not just ""I'm a little jealous.""  My imagination runs wild. She might think landing a guy like Gerald would be just the thing to stick it to her ex. I'm afraid to be alone in the house at night because she might show up with a shotgun. Really. She could plotting that wrecking our home would almost be justifiable because Gerald is financially stable, driving us out of our charming little college town. 

Really. That's the vibe I get. 

I have a huge urge to say

Gerald says:

1. He really values her as a friend. Two years ago,000+ mi. away and Gerald fell into a 6-8 mo. funk, mourning the loss of that friendship. Bob commiserated about the BS at work, was a drinking buddy AND ran with Gerald. It was a huge loss.

2. Finding a running partner who's at your training level and has similar aspirations **and** who will motivate you is really hard. But

3. Gerald is resisting me because he doesn't want to be controlled or told who he can and can't be friends with. I get that. The only defense I have is this is the only time I've asked him to kick anybody to the curb.

Not only am I afraid of what this woman may do if she snaps, breathing hard and have been talking for an hour about how much Larissa's life sucks.

1374332420.0,1ip3az,No longer attracted to my fiancee...,needhelp13,78,17,77,"My fiancee and I have been together for a little over 3 and a half years.  We met in Oct 2009.  About 2 months into our relationship

Fast forward to the past few years.  We started living together 2 years ago in a group house, but I cheated emotionally.  I found a girl that was into similar things to me, and was basically the opposite of my fiancee.  I understand I have to pay the consequences for what I did, and I have not cheated since, nor do I want to.  I wasn't showing my fiancee respect, and I still apologize to her for it.  We have tried working on our relationship by having more fun together, but I never seem to have fun with her.  I've taken up reading more books with her, but reading books together is just one thing.  I've tried including her in the things that I enjoy doing like kayaking, but I understand.  In an attempt to do more with her, I'm supposed to be in charge of her workout program

One thing I forgot to mention is when we got engaged this past January, and I'm not attracted to her emotionally or physically anymore.    My fiancee admits that we aren't the greatest fit for each other, but it's just easier to stay together. Her saying that gives me the feeling that I'm just another check in the box for her.  She has her college degrees, she has her career, and all she has left is the husband and kids (which she has already given me a time frame for).  I don't know if I really want to be a part of her life's list anymore.  

It really makes me think about her as a person, irrational, manipulative, and clingy.  I literally can't go to the bathroom without her asking me where I'm going.  She sometimes follows me to the bathroom and wants to sit in there with me while I go.  Strange, very strange.  I feel like I should address the irrational and manipulative attributes, though.  Just this past week I had lost my cell phone, and she was nearly in tears tell me that I ""always fuck everything up.""  Not exactly sure how I see the connection, I have since had the phone returned to me, but without a driver's license I couldn't, I do feel guilty because she has supported me through so much both financially (which I am currently paying her back for) and emotionally.  My 3 years stationed at my last duty station I was in school earning my degree

I also find her to be manipulative.  We had been in a fight and on the verge of breaking up, we talked and resolved the fight.  It was a little scary for me since I don't ever want anyone to commit suicide over me.  

I will say that there are positives to her.  She is very intelligent, and she would be able to find someone that is more suited for her, but that person isn't me.  She needs someone who will give her all the attention she needs.  She wants someone like her dad who treats his wife much differently than I treat my fiancee.  I am not a person who will do the ""oh kimmy-wimmy I wuv you so much"" stuff.  That seems ridiculous to me.  

With all that said, but I just feel terribly guilty for leaving my fiancee when she has helped me so much.  ",,False,,t5_2r0cn,False,,

I had just turned 23 less then a week ago and she through me a surprise party at my apartment, after me and ""Matt"" got back it had been about 25 minuets and the party had died down quite a lot, less then half the people who where there where gone and ""Allison"" was no where to be found. After calling her phone multiple time I started to get worried, but around the third or fourth time she picked up and told me she was at a friends house.
I was a little upset, I looked into the family room and she was laying on the couch. I thought it was weird she never came to bed and just decided to sleep there but I decide'd to let her sleep.
While watching TV in my room I got a call from my friend ""Tom"" and he asked me if we could go out and talk. I thought something important might have come up so I got my coat on and left ""Allison"" a note saying I went to lunch with ""Tom"". I met ""Tom"" at the Denny's about five minutes away from my apartment
Less then a month ago at her friends wedding she had unprotected sex with one of the grooms and might me pregnant. I went to this wedding with her, so after he ate I drove home still in shock of what I heard.
I walked inside and she was still sleeping on my couch, she had been sending nude pictures to people, even a video of her playing with her self on my camera, these where people I don't even know, and even in one of the texts from a few days back she said ""I'll just tell Atom the baby is his"". At this point I felt my heart break and I don't know what I should do. I have loved this girl with all my heart and she turns out to be cheating on me with multiple guys, I want to kick her out, or should I just catch her in the act. Thank you for reading this.

TL:DR My SO has been cheating on me multiple time,

UPDATE:  Hey guys, it means a lot to me, and thank you azriel777 I think what you said was the best thing to do. Since she is a cheating bitch I got pictures of the texts, she left her phone here thinking that I wouldn't call her in the middle of something. Good thing I know her password :D So since ""Tom"" lives with his parents I invited him to come live with me, he is going to be my new room mate and also be my witness if she wants to take this to court. I called my landlord and he's getting someone to change the locks on Friday, I'll have more updates for you in the future thank you everyone.      ",,,,

Am I an asshole for even thinking about this?**  

I've been dating this girl for a few months, but it's probably set to be the first problem in our relationship.  And in the grand scheme of things, it's not the biggest problem, but I can't help but feel like I'd really like to have a girlfriend who I can be excited to have around my friends.

It's like....have you ever tried to introduce someone a new show/movie that you think is sooo awesome, or you just happened to show them the worst episode in the series, and then you're stuck sitting next to them for an hour cringing or making excuses while they just sit there humoring you, but you can't stop thinking you're totally being judged by the quality of their experience? Yeah, it's sorta like that.

Basically, is pretty bad at taking social cues, and isn't aware when my friends are just forcing one-phrase responses to be polite.  She exudes that kind of high-school Invader-Zim anime-club attitude where people take pride in being almost psychotically hyperactive, and ""random"".  She also doesn't seem to have a sense for what other people find interesting or funny, often telling stories that have no real punchline or bite.  

Fortunately it isn't as bad as I might make it sound.  She doesn't try to *dominate* conversations with her stories or ramblings (I've met a few people who will go on for really long if you don't stop them), and have to make an effort to bring the conversation back to its original rhythm.  Basically, I can tell they're tolerating her just because they want to be polite, but she probably wouldn't get invited to my friends' gatherings or outings, and I don't know that I would really blame them.  Thing is, my g/f thinks that my friends *really* like her and she's making so many new friends!  I'd feel terrible just telling her that this probably isn't the case.

Her immature social attitude is something I'm kinda hoping she'll grow out of eventually

Her bouncy, but I know better than to bring them up during conversations with general audiences because most people aren't interested.  

It's not a dealbreaker for me, she's a very considerate person.  She is mature where it really counts - educated, hard-working, driven, positive, loyal, and rational.  Probably more than I deserve in some of these areas.  She doesn't cling to traditions, and she plays a mean game of Dungeons and Dragons.  Physically, she's someone who has displayed an ""Open communication is the best policy"" attitude towards it

What do I do about the fact that I'm ashamed to bring her around my friends?  Is this something I bring up with her, but I think we should talk about how you act around other people.""?  There's a sick sort of sound to the idea that I can ""teach"" her or ""fix"" her in this department.  It sounds too much like demanding she change her personality to suit my needs or whims.

**A little background :**

We've had infinite problems in the past on *his* end with him calling me names and being disrespectful to me in front of my/his/our friends. 

Our most infamous moment with this (it would take **FAR** too long to recount all of said moments) was when we went out for drinks with one of *my* friends and one of *his* friends on a particularly fine evening. We **all four** started joking at one point about threesomes, and my friend said something to the effect of ""Well, we all know your dress will be on my floor later,"" playing off the fact that I had borrowed one of her dresses and would (obviously) have to return it. **My boyfriend chimes in** with ""not unless I'm there with a camera"" and the joking carries on. I offer up my own joke about only giving a show if it's a makeout session because the more ""intimate"" moments are special and should be ""just for us girls"", and my boyfriend gets moody and eventually makes an excuse to leave. 

I get up to walk him out to his car and he starts yelling at me **in the middle of the parking lot** and in front of about a dozen complete strangers, in much the same way that he was. He then proceeds to jump in his car, leave, call his friend's phone (mine isn't working) demanding to talk to me, call me some more names and then show up **AT THE BAR** with some of the things I'd left at his apartment in a box... still irate and still calling names.

We broke up over shit like this several times, so I need to point out that he has improved, though not completely. 

Now. We've also had problems in the past with me not telling him exactly where I am and what I'm doing, then in his frame of mind I'm ""lying by omission"".

In some cases, and I can see where that would be extremely upsetting. **In most cases, however, I see it differently.** I *never* lie to him about where I've been or what I've been doing when he *asks*, and if I do something as unimportant and blase as grabbing a spur-of-the-moment coffee at the campus Starbucks and I just so happen to see someone there and talk to them for half an hour, I don't feel that he needs a play-by-play of those events. =/

**Today's situation**

One of these kinds of situations arose today. I was studying and needed to share some notes with an acquaintance of mine who is in one of my classes. We met up at a copier on campus and then I decided that since I was hungry and the university cafe was right across the street, so I told him I'd bring him some food. I then asked my study buddy if he wanted to tag along to the cafe and he responded to the affirmative, so we spent 30 minutes eating and then I grabbed lunch for my boyfriend and took it to him (the library is on the way back to my dorm). 

When I arrived at the library to deliver my boyfriend's food to him (in his group study room, citing the fact that *""I didn't even ask him if he would be interested in eating with me""*. I told him that he was missing a lot in that statement, namely that 

* **(1)** he sounded like he was too busy to even talk to me

* **(2)** he could have asked me if I would eat with him if that's what he had really wanted

* **(3)** he completely missed the point that I would have eaten **at the cafe** even if my study buddy had declined my invitation to tag along.

He then proceeded to tell me to just get out, whatever, fuck off""** as I was walking out the door... once again, **IN FRONT OF OUR FRIEND**. 

I gave it 15 minutes and then sent him **this text** :

*""How about I up the ante on this one, so if you want me to 'fuck off', your wish is my command. Good luck on finals and I'll talk to you when you decide that I'm worth more than that.""*

His response was **this text** :

*""I want you to understand what happened. You went to eat lunch with someone and intentionally withheld telling me. Even when I asked what took you so long you just told me you decided to eat there. You made me have to ask you who you were with because I knew you weren't alone. And weren't you already all out of strikes and crying about how you could change? I believe so. This is the best you can do? We have a problem.""*

He then **called me** and proceeded to tell me that he wasn't *""going to have a text war with me""* and began to argue that I had *""lied to him yet again""* because I *""intentionally left details out""* and furthermore *""made him ask more than one question to get the whole story.""* 

Later

*""You more often than not intentionally leave out the part where you were with someone else. I always have to ask or get it our of you some way other than having you just willingly tell me when I ask ""What are you doing?"" I've been over this with you time and time again on this very subject so don't even try to play ignorant. I'm sick and fucking tired of never getting the truth from you. It was just a week ago that we were having this out for the thousandth time and you wanted so badly to have another chance because you said you would do better. So, there is a very serious problem here.""*

**Seriously... let me outline the facts again.**

* **(1)** I always tell him who I was with when he asks. Otherwise I don't consider it important. Never do I lie to him about who I've been with or what I've been doing when the question is posed. Also, so it's not like I'm withholding information and hiding illicit, non-relationship-friendly activities. (I say 95% because I'm certainly not perfect, but even that 5% isn't heinous.)

* **(2)** He flips out like this over almost everything... whether it be something as simple as a spur-of-the-moment lunch or not.

* **(3)** What he keeps referring to in his texts is another similar situation in which I decided to go Black Friday shopping with one of my best friends and texted him to tell him about it en route to Target at 5 am. His beef then was that I made plans and didn't text him to tell him about it until I was already carrying them out... thereby again ""intentionally withholding information"", harassed me about it incessantly and threatened to break up with me over and over again. (yay)

We were pretty casual when we first started hooking up (didn't have the ""should we be exclusive?"" discussion until about 4 months into hanging out); it's clear I was way more emotionally attached way sooner than he was and I think this makes me insecure

We're on each other's laptops all the time and (so far as I know) never had an issue with trust or privacy. We were getting ready to watch a movie and I was closing a bunch of windows on his laptop when I saw one that had his gmail open, except that it looked like he saved (resaved?) some of the pictures from the email to his computer. Not sure why he'd do this since he's always had access to my facebook pics and could have easily just saved them from my profile. 

The email went into A LOT of detail about what my body looked like and quite a few of my sexual proclivities. It was pretty crude and made me feel weirdly exposed, was this line, which I remember verbatim: ""she's such a freak, I'm sure she'll let me make a videotape (of which I'll happily send you a copy)."" WTF. It's embarrassing, too, because we DID make videos, way later in our relationship when we started dating more seriously. I've also sent him a crapload of naughty pictures. I've made it pretty clear that I would be embarrassed for anyone besides him to see them. We share a life together and tell one another everything, I guess).

I pressed the back button and saw that he sent a bunch of similar emails to about 4 of his other guy friends. I met his friends pretty soon into our relationship and I had no idea they all had a run-down of what I look and sound like during sex before even meeting me. I'll admit it's kind of humiliating. 1 of the emails was just FB pictures (all my FB pics are very standard/tame)

It also bothers me because one time he asked if I would be mad if he showed his friends naked pictures of me. I said I would be mad and asked if he had already done that. He said no and we got in a huge fight for the rest of the night. He assured me that, it would just be because he was ""so proud"" that he was ""getting to bang"" me and to prove to his friends that my boobs were real. These sounded like the most horrible reasons ever to me, and it wasn't until the morning-after that he relented and said it would be a shitty thing to do.


I really

I do intend to confront him about this, I don't really talk nitty-gritty sex stuff with my girlfriends. We might talk about sex very generally but I've never had a conversation about specific guys' bodies or what they did or liked during sex, even if the guys weren't serious boyfriends. However, people have told me that's not the norm, so am I being kind of a baby about this?

""When you (insert specific behavior here)

Basically I said I need more romance and need to be touched in order to feel desired and wanted.  I pointed to specific examples of his past actions that made me feel loved/appreciated/sexy/etc: 

""That time you closed and locked the door behind me when I came in, and it really made me feel sexy.""

""When you come in from work and go straight to your Xbox, and then spend time with me afterward.""

Well

Last week he came home from work with roses and a teddy bear for me and came directly to show affection to me and tell me how much he loves me before passing out on the couch... another day he said, cuddled with me on the couch, then turned off the TV and took me to bed for the kind of sex we used to have.  In fact, we've been having lots of sex since that talk.  :)

* Stop putting yourself down. Not only is bashing yourself a turn-off, but remember that rejection will only allow you to move on from a situation that would never go anywhere. The worst that can happen is you move on to someone who might like you. Best that can happen is you get the girl/guy you were going after.

* If someone wants to be with you, they will treat you well.

1370658838.0,1fwlfd,Caught Stepdad Cheating On Mother. Need Advice!,cbass_1636,70,8,37,"First off

My mother divorced my father about 16 years ago (married for 8 years) and about 1 year later got into in a relationship with my now step-father. She had 4 kids at the time (myself and my 3 brothers) and my stepdad didn't really mind. Objectively, and he is somewhat older/less attractive so I'm sure this contributed to him being fine with her having 4 kids from a previous marriage.

He was a fine father figure, though they only got married my senior year of high school (I just graduated from college and am now 22), so they have been married about 5 years.

Honestly, a Junior in college at the time, knew that was a *horrible* idea and did my best to rectify the situation. I had saved up some money (about 11k) from a school job/scholarships/internships and used that to pay her bills for the next two months. I called her job and eventually got them to reinstate her part-time with an option to be fully reinstated if she kept at it.

Turns out, took it the hardest. He became sullen and angry, and to this day is still combative with my parents. 

Eventually, she thinks she would never be able to find anyone else as good as my stepdad. 

Even though things are obviously rocky, and generally getting back to the way things were. My mom expressed some concerns to me a few months ago that my stepdad had contacted his ex-girlfriend (**RED FLAG**) but I guess she saw the texts (or facebook message, idk which) and said they were pretty benign. I told her at this point if he's still talking to her things probably aren't as done as she thought, and she started crying. I told her she'd have my own and all her sons' support if she did leave him (and she said she'd consider it), but I know her and there's no fucking way she'd decide to do that on her own. 

Fast forward to earlier today. I'm back home in California (just graduated)

&gt;**Her**: ""Hi

&gt;**Me**: ""No

(I thought it was a telemarketer and was confused as to why they called *my* number)

&gt;**Her**: ""This is '*my stepdad's name*' girlfriend. He told me to call this number in case of emergency""

&gt;**Me**(*suspicious as fuck now*): ""No he's not here at the moment. Sorry

&gt;**Her**: ""I'm his girlfriend.""

&gt;**Me**: ""Ohhhh

&gt;**Her**: ""Okay

Now at this point, it's painfully obvious that my stepdad is still cheating on my mom. Secondly, what kind of *fucking idiot* stepfather gives their girlfriend his stepson's phone number in case of emergency? (And I'm almost positive it wasn't a real medical emergency... part of the reason this extramarital relationship was such a problem is that my stepdad was giving his girlfriend a ton of financial support... pretty sure she needed money). 

I was about to call my stepdad and tell him to get out of my mom's life (along with a few choice 12 and 4 letter expletives), but who knows?). Second (and more important), is the fact that I have no idea how my mom is going to react. Last time she quit her job, completely abandoned my younger brother who was still in high school at the time, drained the family's resources (including my own 11k), and had a mental breakdown trying to start a business when she has no clue how to get it off the ground yet. 

Further complicating matters is that my mom and stepdad just moved back in together to a new place (renting)

On the other hand, I'm pretty sure my stepdad is still cheating on her and that **sucks**. 

The way I see it

1. Go with my initial gut instinct and tell my stepdad to fuck off

2. Talk to my stepdad and find out what the extent of him and his ""girlfriend's"" relationship is. Maybe it's nothing. Maybe it's something. 

3. Tell my mom. She deserves to know the truth

4. Just let it stew. My mom is just getting back on track

To be honest, but even if I did I'm almost certain she'd end up with him again. It's hard seeing that your parents aren't the smartest people on the planet and make dumb mistakes just like the rest of us. 

I'm only 22 though and have been in exactly 1 ""long term"" relationship (a total of 2.5 years) and would really appreciate some input/advice on what to do.

Okay, she really feels like she needs to have a break from my sexual energy. What happens for her is that she sees me constantly coming at her, and when that happens, all she wants to do is retract further in order to be safe. Yeah, some of that is because of her childhood abuse issues. But some is also just a life stage thing - she's done having sex for procreation, and wants to discover her sexuality post-children and post-procreation. And, for whatever reason

So, to see if there's a way we can intersect that will get my needs for physical intimacy addressed. That doesn't mean it's not frustrating.

After reading all of your great comments and advice, **I am going to set my own time line**. I am deciding to stop pursuing her physically **for the next two weeks** and I'll happily report back how that goes. I think I need to take control over the situation, and oddly, that means **I need to be the one to say ""no sex""**. My hope is that after two weeks of experiencing me not pursuing her, she'll actually get the space she needs, and will start coming to me for physical affection.

All this being said, I'm going to have a straight talk with my wife about how I can start getting my sexual needs met elsewhere. Hopefully something could be worked out that allows us to stay together - maybe I get involved in kink activities, become an erotic massage model for training courses, take on a FWB, etc.. These things all seem pretty remote possibilities right now, but as I said, I'm not okay with this sexless marriage going on for much longer.

Again

**Update**

Talked with my therapist and he encouraged me - as a short term solution - to give my wife the two week break from touching, self-care, etc.). This is not a long term solution, but for the short term, it's really the best I can do. At the end of the two weeks, he recommended letting her know that I have consciously stopped touching her in order to respect her boundary, and then finding out what it was like for her and what the next steps could be for us.

So I just had my first mother's day with my wife and young baby.

My idea for Mother's day was sleep in as late as she wanted, spend the day at the aquatic centre, a cafe on the way home and a play in the park followed by a nice cooked dinner and Game of Thrones in bed.  We did some of those things. With lots of tears in between.

My wife instead wanted something 'organised' and 'special'. It was just like 'any other day' And because I hadn't planned anything specific she felt neglected and disappoint.  

I tried to reason with her that to me it was a day we could relax and enjoy each other's company and spend time with our daughter but it kept coming back to me not being organised and I was 'making the day up as it went along'

I don't think she will see my point of view.  I found it strange that someone would be so upset at the thought of spending the day with their family? The more I reinforced it the angrier she got.  In the end I let her go and I slept in the spare room.

I think she overreacted and thing she could have had a special day if she wanted to. Instead she resigned herself to being upset.

I don't want her to be upset but I don't want to go back to her grovelling like dog with it's tail between its legs.

Should I plan a day that she pictured next weekend and go all out to make up for it? How can I recover from this? 

We are both 32. We have been together for about 10 years and married 18 months

She is a good mother

She left her home country to be with me.
However, but she’s very judgemental and I feel that I would have a much more active social live if she didn’t hold everybody up to such high standards.

This is just one of the many ways in which I feel “snowed under” in this relationship.
I wish I could describe it better

The last years I have been consumed by a very strong feeling of discontent. I have not told her this
It’s not what she does

I think we do a good job of raising our kids and she seems very happy with me.
So the only problem is that I am actually totally unhappy and depressed.
I’ve been in a state of mild depression over this for several years now. Add to that the guilt I feel for having a third child
And the panic I feel when I think about having to grow old together.

I went to a therapist

I’ve been contemplating divorce for a while now
-She has no network of friends or family to support her and it would be very traumatic for her.
-I shudder to think what her life would look like as a divorced mother with few social contacts.
-She has a major health problem (periods of extreme fatigue
-The kids. Jesus
-I am consumed by feelings of guilt.

So based on the above I have decided a hundred times to just tough it out
This situation is turning me into someone very cynical and bitter. 

another thing I’m thinking about is trying to redefine the relationship and claw back some of the life I had before I got married. Going out by myself

But at best I think I can make the relationship more bearable for me.

tl;dr: 
I'm trapped in a marriage I'm sick of.

Also

Sister: Kim
Her husband: Nick
Myself: Anne

About two years ago, nor did I ever hear anything regarding them dating or anything. I had come to find out they had met through mutual friends through their church, and had only gone out for a few weeks before he had popped the question. I was very surprised by all of this, but after talking to my parents, they informed me he was a very nice guy, and his family was very wonderful.

I ended up meeting Nick when I had moved back home, the wedding went fantastic, and from there onward their marriage always seemed fine and normal.

About 6 months after, even go into stories about his exploits with drugs and partying. (I have nothing against someone doing any of these things, but coming from someone who labeled himself a very strict god-fearing man, it was shocking to my husband and I, especially when he had never behaved like this before.)

The four of us would go out whenever we visited each other, and VERY angry. Any small incident would set him off. For instance, one night we had gone out dancing and a young woman happened to accidently bump into him while we were on the dancefloor. He became furious and screamed in this poor girls face. Berating her and even knocking her drink out of her hand. I took my sister aside to try and talk to her, but she would just tell me, ""Oh, he's just drunk, just forget about this

Skip forward a few months. These situations have happened repeatedly, which he then will, but the look on my sisters face when it happens is always a more worried and nervous one.

Most recently, Nick and my mother had gone shopping and during which they came to visit me in my store. With it being near the holidays, we were swamped, and apparently Nick didn't like waiting in line one bit. He threw a fit and threw some clothes around and walked out. During the ride home, my mom confronted him and told him he should feel embarrassed and to stop behaving like a child. He didn't take to well to this, and we found out later that night that he broke a few things on my parents property and damaged my mothers vehicle. (He had broke some garden vases and bent my mothers front bumper and license plates. We thought it was just a vandal but my husband talked a confession out of him.) 

This was our last and final straw and my mother and father decided to try and go about this in an adult fashion and to perhaps just sit and talk about everything and figure out if something was wrong to where he needed help. When my father explained to Nick in a phonecall that he needed to sit with my mother and apologize to her, Nick replied with, ""No and good luck ever trying to talk to your daughter again. She'll never see you two ever and don't try to change this,"" and he hung up.

Soon after that

That was about 5 days ago, but it was a short one that only said, ""Thinking of you, love and miss you!"" I have replied but have gotten no response since. 

Now

* He has been arrested numerous times for assault and battery
* He has been arrested numerous times on drug charges
* He owns a house in another state
* He has moved every two years since moving out
* He had physically and emotionally abused his previous wife

We got in contact with his ex-wife, threatened to kill her animals, choked her unconscious, put her into a hospital, threatened her family, EVERYTHING.

At this point we really don't know what to do. My sister has no clue of ANY of this

We are planning to leave tomorrow to catch her sometime during her daily errands and tell her everything and show her the reports we have

I need advice or help please, heard, and from what his ex has told us, we are scared that this could end up with her in a hospital or with a fate far worse.

I'm the only only child

Me and my wife met online almost 13 years ago. I was 17, after a few months she found an apartment and went to live on her own but in the same town. I stayed with my parents until I was about halfway through my military service, and moved in with her at age 20.

In the beginning, and after this had gone on for about six months, she asked me if I knew something about it. I asked my mother about it (thinking it must be some misunderstanding), and to my surprise - mom was upset. About what, you ask?

My wife had, that was apparently enough to freeze her out.

We worked through this. My wife apologized profusely, basically. The wifes family are much more informal, and are greater in numbers which causes more frequent visits for birthdays and so on.

At this point

This has been coming and going in waves over the years. Things are okay for a while, doesn't talk about feelings, don't thank her enough for some other gift, doesn't try on a sweater (gift) when she is presented with it, and so on. Lots of, in my mind, immature stuff.

Note that I can understand some of the complaints by my mother. I too would be sad if I didn't have a very good relationship with my only kids spouse. But mom is special

This weekend, ""say her peace"" and claimed to ""have been quiet about this long enough"".
Que another rant, my wife took initiative to sending flowers apparently doesn't count much), and said that ""maybe you think we are two idiots here, and mock us with your parents and friends"". Mom - wtf?!

I responded the next day, that she was the one ""suffering"".

Repeatedly my wife has been taking subtle and not-so-subtle abuse from my mother. My wife can show my mom scrapbooking-stuff that she uses and likes, what my wife is thinking and so on.

In the midst of this, and my parents urged us to go through with it or look into sperm donations (yeah, getting personal up in this subreddit, I don't have the strongest swimmers :) ).
When we once again told them that adoption was our choice and a deep rooted choice

Last year we were matched with a 15 months old girl, and not an abstract idea. This july, though, we lost our girl. We didn't get the chance to ever see or meet her, other arrangements were made in the country where she lives. There was no adoption, but we feel as if we have lost a child. Much care from my parents? Hrm, try little-to-none.

Mom has had a rough life emotionally. She lost her dad early and had to assume a sort of provider-role for her little siblings. Her mother didn't treat her with love, and a few years with a therapist couldn't fix it really. Another cause of distress is alcohol. She doesn't get blaring drunk, but after a few glasses of wine the emotions come out and the drama can start. IRL, by phone, or by email.

It can be worth mentioning this is a behavior often displayed by my mother. She does nothing wrong, six years after, that they have resumed some contact. Through the years, I've heard mom talk about how neighbours are strange, how coworkers are idiots and possibly conspire against her (not as strongly as that, but you get the point).

So. Now there was this email this weekened. We visited this spring and again about 3 weeks ago and had a great time. My wife is fucking fed up with having to take all this crap and apologize for things she hasn't done. Now we are writing a reply mail to my mom, but filled with indignation and martyrdom.

And so, we may get matched with a new child to adopt in the coming months, making things even more complicated.

Redditors have been known for perspective and wisdom before

**TLDR: I've been together with my wife for almost 13 years, for avoiding contact and have frozen out my wife for not thanking enough for presents. Now, a new email accuses my wife of new things, insulting and mocking her. We've had about enough, but the risk of severing contact is naturally extremely upsetting as I'm an only child.

At some point though (and im embarrassed to admit this) I had her phone while I was alone and I checked it. I know I shouldn't have.. but what I found was a little disconcerting. There wasn't anything explicit per se... but she was at the very least playful. She was texting two guys who she used to know. Old friends. I know they aren't exes and I know that they've never fooled around or anything. But that doesn't make me feel any better. Also... she deleted the conversations at a later time (I ended up checking her phone again.. I know...) meaning she obviously doesn't want me to see these conversations.

Anyways lately when we talk on the phone I can hear her phone going off with incoming text messages and her replying to them (she has me on speaker and types on the phone). This goes on some nights between 12-2am.

I like the idea of leaving my girlfriend as much privacy as possible. I really do. But I'm worried that I'm letting her walk all over me. The problem is that given how I know about these texts (snooping in her phone) I'm really not at all sure how to bring it up. It really freaks me out.

28/female and the husband is my age. We've been married for a little under a year now and have always had great communication except regarding one person - a long time female friend of his.

To tell you a little about myself first, should spend time alone together with another of the opposite sex, unless they could completely trust one another and kept no secrets.  I've always been okay with that and have no problem with (I have no desire to) spend one on one time when other men. That's just me.

My husband is a very sweet guy and very passionate towards me. I have no doubt in my mind that he loves me and wouldn't intentionally hurt me. I know that he is a jealous guy

Anyways, and he said that he would stop. Well, it got to the point to where they would get drunk and start disrespecting me to my face. According to my husband, it wasn't intentional(he doesn't even remember it with how smashed they were). By disrespecting me, I mean she was insulting me and my beliefs and he was attacking me with her. This pretty much blew it for me. I was hurt and humiliated...and *sober*. I continued to try to put up with her, until she started spamming me on FB with insults. AWFUL insults. I cut her off and told him *no more*. He always takes her side in debates, even though prior to any debates, it makes me jealous. I feel like a third wheel. I just wish he would stand up for me and stop being a hypocrite when it comes to her.


Our relationship had never been better and was dramatically improving during this time off from her. 

A year and some months later and I receive a random novel in facebook full of apologies and what not from her. I am a forgiving person, but laid down some rules. I told him I was not prepared for them to be spending time alone together or anything of the likes. I knew it would just flip me out. She totally disrespected me in the past, WITH HIM, and he never stood up for me once to her. That hurt more than anything. I wasn't about to let what we've worked for be destroyed.

Okay, I've been gritting my teeth and I see them having conversations online. I know they call and text each other. It's driving me insane inside and I have no idea how to react. He set up plans to meet with her, but after I asked him about what he was planning on doing for the day, he got paranoid and I guess it never happened. He never mentioned the plans he had made with her. I also call him every day on my way home from work, this is the relief for the hour and a half drive I have to make. Well, yesterday, he said he had to go. Well okay, and I found out he had hung up with me to take her call. I know I am guilty of so many wrong things here, okay

Last night we had a long debate on her FB (she debates everything). For the first time in our relationship

Why is he being so secretive about this when he is about nothing else? Is it because he knows I would be pissed? It only makes me more angry knowing the truth and knowing that he is hiding it from me.
I gave them a chance to try again

How do I confront him? Tell him I am a nosey, that's why I'm so concerned. Do I just need professional help?

Unfortunately for both of us I have experienced serious health issues for the last 6 years that has resulted in a serious deficit in our sex life. I have a pretty severe form of arthritis... Which makes the kind of sex that we both enjoy (or used to enjoy) too painful.  In addition to the terrible joint pain and stiffness -- because of the arthritis I am also often just exhausted ALL the time. The arthritis isn't the only problem. I also have a problem with prolonged periods of menstrual activity that can go on for weeks and weeks, and I feel gross

I *want* to WANT to have sex with my husband. I love him. I find him very attractive. I have talked with my doctor about it at length...
We have tried to explore other kinds of sex...but one of the main problems is -- with so many of the health issues going on - all the time -- I just don't feel desire for it. And my husband does not want me to have sex if I am just doing it for him.. he wants me to enjoy it and be into him.

We have a very loving relationship. And he is a very sexually driven person. And I feel absolutely horrible that I am not providing him with intimacy. I feel guilt about it. Terrible guilt. 

Because of the joint pain problems

I guess to compound the problem.. Perhaps the sex would happen better or more often.. except that my husband understandably self-satisfies himself frequently... and more times than I can recount... when the stars align and my health issues are temporarily not an issue and I initiate sex.. many times we will start to get going -- but the problem is

I don't mind (have never minded) porn or masturbation -- but sometimes I feel like that might be part of the problem... If the sex did not take so long

Anyways -- I am ready to explore the idea of working with him at finding  somebody that he could have sex with -- that I would feel comfortable with. Is there anybody out there that has done this sort of thing for the same sorts of reasons? Has it worked? What kind of problems can I expect? Am I being stupid about making the decision to do this?

I'm 22 now and have a best friend for the last 17 years of my life. We've been through thick and thin. Have grown up together and started out adulthood together. 

Except he has been very neglectful and abusive to me psychologically throughout most of that time. Which has hindered my understanding of relationships greatly throughout my life as at many times he was my only friend (I was bullied mentally and physically a lot as a kid and teenager).

This is where I Spoil the Movie:

So here we were last Friday night 24 May watching The Hangover Part 3. The 3 of us: Him

Here I am sitting right next to a man watching this movie

So just now this afternoon he starts acting like a prick and I defend myself. He makes several deflections

I hope you can understand that I waited until he fucked up again to make this decision not because I'm being a pussy. But because He's been my best friend for most of my life and is indeed a large part of my life and social standing.

I'm the sole breadwinner and I resent her. Not so much because she spends money but doesn't earn it but because she's throwing her life away. She has no real passions that she pursues on her own. I'm really afraid she's so shallow that I can't have any real respect for her. She's not driven and I feel like I may be completely unfair judging her for that but what am I supposed to do if that's a turnoff for me?

We don't have any real common interests...we've tried a few things but not a concerted effort to make a common interest.  My pursuits are more intellectual and hers are more strictly fun.

Sex life is OK but not great. We have sex a couple times a week. I have lower sex drive than her

She's completely devoted to me...in that area I couldn't ask for much else. But she doesn't challenge me

I've supported her through college and other tough times...I kept thinking this isn't working...I would make calendar reminders to myself months in the future saying ""What are you still waiting for?""

I've had a few (4

My biggest fear about leaving her is that she has nothing else. Her family is a bunch of parasites and she doesn't have a fulltime job so she can't support herself. The job part will probably change soon and I don't think I could leave her until that happens.

I know the common answer is to talk to her and try to make our marriage work.  If that's your advice then please help me with ideas about how to approach the subject. I don't think me saying ""I think you're shallow, isn't it?

I've tried more indirect approaches to these topics before and they haven't yielded results. I think if I talk to her about this it has to be very direct but I also think that will be incredibly hurtful.

*Thanks for all the advice. I'm going to talk to her in a few days and let her know where I'm at. Not going to leave just telling her how I'm feeling right now and how long I've felt this way. Hopefully she'll have something as well so it isn't entirely one way. Maybe we can work through it.*

Adam and I have met online in late 2010, he would borrow me his without hesitation even though he needed it, because he knew I needed it more. I would visit his work place, and we would do soda-drinking challenges, mixing Pepsi and chocolate milk together, and bet on our stomachs to chug that monster of a mix down our throats. Adam is also really good at math, he would spend hours teaching me GRE math problems even though they're so easy for him; he would quiz me on vocabularies late into the night even though it's not the most interesting thing to do on a weekday evening after work. As a foreigner moving to the Pacific Northwest for grad school alone, I feel safe and secure like I've never experienced before. 

After we started dating, one day, after spending a night at his place, I logged on to his computer to check my email only to find a greeting from the coworker, asking if he's awake and ready to go to work. To me, it was terrifying because I was never close to guys as I was close to Adam. I perceived it as them being just as close as we are. My fear grew as the coworker would call him nicknames in front of me, and invite him out to movies without inviting me. Adam never agreed to going alone, cooking classes, until one day she told me ""Adam would make a really good boyfriend, and ask Adam to stop contacting her or initiate talking to her because it bothers me that him and her are so close. Adam says there's nothing going on between them

This year marks the 2nd Valentine's Day we are together, 16 time zones away from each other. I started to panic on the day of Valentine's Day because he has not said anything yet. I haven't slept for the whole night, feeling really sick in bed, my heart is beating like drum. Then, it was Adam's time-zone for Valentine's Day. He wished me Happy Valentine's Day and didn't express much after. I felt dread in my body, thinking that he must've stopped loving me, and that he might be spending the evening with the coworker for dinner. I frantically called him on his cellphone and texted him and finally got a calm and cheery response 'hi bunny'. The mind of a me, is eating me alive. I couldn't hold back describing the details of what I imagined in my head to him, what he is doing. In the same dialogue

Adam was furious, being told i don't love you anymore, shit like that. I already wished you a happy valentine's day. I planned a gift with your sister...you can ask her what it is after dinner. I'm logging out. talk to you later."" Embarrassed, I found out from my sister that he has already made plans weeks before to surprise me, but the planning is a bit laborious so delays are expected. At that moment, I had no words to describe how bad I feel, only to accept that I am my own worst enemy, fear, is a series of childhood memories of my father's affairs, and this ironically feeds to fuel for my insecurity. 'What if he doesn't love me anymore?' I think to myself every single day. It is an unhealthy hell to be in

Just 10 days to my 28th birthday. I have come to understand that the ability to love the right way, such as myself, we need to know that if this relationship cracks, it will be because of our insecurity. Being insecure creates a self-fulfilling prophecy for whatever fear we imagine could happen.  There's a good book called ""Attached"" by Amir Levine. I recommend it to everyone who's anxious in a relationship like 20% of the population does, it teaches us how to manage our thoughts and irrational reasoning in times of extreme self-perceived stress, it also shows us how we could reduce these energy-draining negativity and create a broader awareness of the real situation at hand.  

Just 10 days to my 28th birthday. To me, addictive love tries to create love even though we feel frightened; it is like being swept away down a raging river. Addictive love is always looking for more or better; it comes from outside, it wants to take. Always believe in yourself, and know that we all have a chance to grow in a healthy love. The negativity and insecurity is getting tiring, it is damaging the most wonderful relationship I have had, and is taking a toll on Adam, none of which really happened overnight. I shall overcome, for this relationship, and I am not here to abuse his strength

Anyway, and during the later part of the relationship something seemed off. We were getting into more and more fights (shocking

Things seem to have steadied out, because I trust her, blah, blah.   We had been best friends for upwards of 7 years before we started dating, but all of a sudden, everything is really dodgy.  I would go up to visit her at camp now and then (it was only 25 miles away from my home or so, so not really a long drive), she'd come by for weekends, which is fine; I have lots of female friends and she has lots of guy friends

Over IM.  So after watching a year and a half relationship basically end over IM, 3 weeks later, she's dating a guy she meets at camp.  I tried to go back to being friends with her, but I'm beginning to think that was the wrong choice.  This girl meant more to me than basically anyone, we had been through a lot together and it was really difficult to feel like someone whom I cared so much about, and thought cared so much about me would have so little respect for me that this would happen.

Being the doormat that I now realize I was being, then extended until we finished college, and so on over the course of these few weeks.  She uninvited me to her brother's wedding, which I understood, and said that her brother “put A (her current boyfriend) to replace my spot”.  She initially told me that she was going to go to her brother's wedding alone, but I suspected something was up when I realized that it was A that she was going with; they had become very friendly over the course of the summer and would hang out together regularly after we had broken up.  Lo and behold, after the wedding, and I'm more or less sure she broke up with me for him.  Whatever.

So after all of that, deleted her from facebook, hit the gym, all that HILARIOUS joke, and tried to make some progress.  She wouldn't let it go.  I told her to leave me alone; I didn't want to hear from her for a while, I needed space, more or less blamed her for the breakup and our subsequent falling out.  A lot of lies and disrespect were thrown out on her part, and start to forgive her and someday in the (likely distant) future be friends again.

However, and started making progress.  I had a conversation here and there that was regularly friendly, until it became too much, I asked for space, and she wouldn't give it to me again.  This would regular get us into yelling matches where she would claim that I was being cruel to her, and me telling her that it was her fault for destroying a friendship that was pretty (really) awesome, and from my viewpoint, which was a promise that we had made to each other very early in the relationship.  She told me that she wasn't breaking up with me for someone else, and needed to find herself

But then it gets interesting.  Throughout the period of time that we dated, she was never on any type of medication, asked me to keep quiet about it, and said “don't bring it up to my mother, it makes her really upset” and to avoid the topic around family because they “Don't talk about it.”  She never had any serious issues when we were both home (We live a town away from each other), or when I was visiting her.  It was always when we were apart, she would go to the hospital, and she'd be sent home with no medication or anything; she said the doctors never knew what was wrong with her kidneys

I got a text from her a couple of weeks ago, and has been texting me on a very regular basis, more or less trying to get me to talk to her again, and to work things out.  However, she hasn't come around in a tone that wants to make peace; she comes off in a tone that says “Hurry the fuck up and forgive me, I'm dying, so I deserve to be forgiven.”  The problem is, too of really shady claims and lies) that I don't trust a word she says.  I am by no means a psychologist

This puts me in a REALLY awkward position; this is the girl that was my best friend for almost a decade.  That's nearly half my life, but at the same time I find it impossible to trust her after the barrage of lies and betrayal she put me through.  I did what may or may not be a mistake, I texted her mother saying that I hope everything is okay, that the rest of the family is doing well, and that I heard about my ex's plight, and offered that if there were anything I could do, that I would be there.  I was hoping that if it was a real sickness that I'd at least get to offer my support to her family (whom I still care about a great deal; they are incredible people even if I do not speak with them or keep in touch, and if it wasn't real that I'd get a “what the hell are you talking about?” response from her mother.  Both of these were terrifying to me, then she needs some serious psychological help.

So at this point, and leave me with bitter memories of her.

At this point, but what do you guys think?  Based off of the granted, marginal information and context provided, does it sound like the truth?  I know I would know her better than anyone else, but I don't feel like burdening friends or family with more of my frustrations about the situations, and so I turn to the almighty Reddit, king of relationships.

EDIT: Breakup was last summer (July 2012), anymore.  The relationship is over, and I'm fine with that, this is not a ""woe is me I still miss her and don't want it to be over if she dies blah blah omg halp i laub her"" kind of thing.

TL;DR: Best friends of 8 years, ex says she has two months to live due to a kidney problem she told me not to talk to her family and friends about and has never taken any medication for.  Not sure whether or not I should believe her.  And if it does turn out to be true, how I should even hope to handle the situation.

Also; sorry if this story sounds disjointed and clusterfucked.  I kind of wrote this in one stream of consciousness sitdown.


EDIT: Short update, but I guess that doesn't really matter.  I have class right now, and unfortunately have to run and do a couple of errands before I get home, but when I do I'll call her mother and give you guys an update should I have a conversation with her.  Thanks a lot for all of the suggestion (not a typo), you guys rule; a bro fist AND  high five for all of you.  That's right, not just one, both.

We: Mortgage on a house in both our names, have a year and a half old dog, 2 cats, we try to enjoy life through all the ups and downs it has given us.

I found out a month and a half ago that I was needed by my job to travel to Belgium for work for 25ish days beginning July 1st.  This would be my longest trip away from her since we began seeing each other and living together.  Of course this was met with some tough feelings of her thinking I was abandoning her there

She was expected to arrive Friday

She is French, she started learning English close to 6 years ago, and she's really good for someone who speaks french all day at work, and only outside work does she encounter English, but we still have our spats due to a language barrier (I am having to re-learn french as I knew it when I was younger but we moved to an English only area and lost most of it).  She went to visit Quebec city on Saturday and Sunday with one of her co-workers(female) who had never seen the city.  It's a beautiful place, we've been there a few times together in the last year to enjoy the scenery and get away from our lives for a few days.  I'm not sure what happened on that trip to the city, and from here is where I'm completely lost.

I received her email this morning at around 4:30am, either on the phone or over Skype in this situation will not have the guts to pick up the phone to speak to me directly.  I would have installed skype on her computer, however before I left she disagreed and told me she would see me in Paris at the airport when I picked her up.  I questioned it but dropped it afterwards.

Her email brings up past things that she has told me.  Specifically in the family department.  I do not want children, they had 4 kids, and I've raised my brothers and felt that I didn't want to live that way)  She has never had a problem with this, in fact, she always told me that she didn't want kids either, and she wanted to be able to enjoy her life to the fullest, financially and time wise.  Now her email is saying that she won't be coming to Belgium because she doesn't want to come and pretend things are fine, but after this email

I've been gone for 2 weeks

I'm at a complete loss.  I don't really know what happened in Quebec City.  I obviously don't know the whole truth of the trip if she saw all her friends and they instantly made her want to leave me.

She then looked at me for a second and then asked if I wanted a threesome with said girl.

Wat.

I looked at her for about five seconds before ascertaining that she was A) drunk as fuck

So back up. This whole situation came as a great shock to me because neither of us have ever had polyamorous inclinations -- or at least, but I had (and I think rightly) assumed there would be none. So I'm way fucking floored.

I went along with it for a little while, and that was that, because the feeling really started to well up in me that -- fuck, I've just completely been had by my girlfriend. She drunkenly made out/did whatever else with a random person that was not me for an undetermined period of time, and then tried to get me involved into this situation as well. I told her I wanted to leave, both because I felt weird and because she was too drunk to be doing something like this, and she consented

So that's what's up. I have no idea what to think or feel about this situation. Part of me is really offended and betrayed that she did something so overtly sexual with a stranger, or something. And part of me is a little disappointed I turned down the opportunity at all. She said (again, before she passed flat out because she was horrendously drunk) that she was really sorry and feels like a ""shithead"" and that it won't happen again. But I don't know whether to believe her.

I decided to let it be hers.

1260569434.0,adqq9,How Not To Conduct a Relationship: A cautionary tale,,65,7,52,"First

Secondly

Briefly, I was about to embark on a solo trip to Germany to spend a month with friends I made through my university's exchange program (including a German man I was in a relationship with until I met my current boyfriend; the German confessed to me that he met a girl closer to home, too, so we ended our involvement mutually and amicably). I had so much going on in my life at that time that I felt good about, that I didn't feel I needed a partner. The physical contact and companionship were great, but not something I was focused on. I left for Germany after this guy and I -- we'll call him D -- had been seeing each other for a month. I came back a month later, and he was so enamored with me that he formally asked me to be his girlfriend. As in, took my hand in his, I was experiencing the kind of love I no longer believed existed.

About three months later, the job loss was devastating to me. For as long as I live, I will never forget how hollow I felt as my boss told me he was going to have to let me go. He sent me on my merry way with a mere two weeks' salary and a letter of reference. I lost it. D was right there, and he did everything a fantastic boyfriend would do to cheer me up. I gave myself a day to grieve and then hit the pavement. Everything I applied to, I was turned down for. The first week, I had four interviews. Then two the following week. Then one. Then none. Fast forward another three months and I lost everything I owned. Apartment, car, my world was turned upside down. I moved back in with my mother and had to face the tumultuous relationship with her I had avoided for many years by that point. 

I'm giving a lot of information here, my credit score plunged, and I was utterly and completely without a way out of the hole I found myself in. I moved in with D at that point, but by then, I had become an entirely different person than the dynamic girl he had fallen in love with: I was fixated, utterly and completely, on him and our relationship. Where I had once simply enjoyed his presence in my life, and when he wasn't right there, and I eventually began dating other people. D was there to listen to me as I told him about the guy who showed up to our date and proceeded to tell me all the ways he'd like to defile Britney Spears, low-paying job

This cycle would repeat itself a few times. I eventually got back into my own place, I had the vastly less dysfunctional relationship with him. I repaid D for his kindness by fixating on the mistakes he made, no matter how big or small, rather than by appreciating him for all the wonderful things he did for me. And most recently, I had become consumed by the kind of jealousy I had only heard about from my guy friends whose girlfriends were utter psychos. Any female he talked to heralded the imminent end of our relationship; they were young, fun, attractive, I lost sight of myself, I have to face the possibility that maybe he has. It destroys me

Even as I sit and think of the things he did that weren't exactly helpful, I wouldn't be writing this. I've been so content to believe all this time that he caused these reactions in me, when it was really the other way around. 

Today, and it suddenly doesn't matter if he's surrounded by adorable college-aged girls anymore. I had an idea that it would do this for me, but I really didn't know for sure until I actually made the move. But as I picked up my cell phone to call him and share the good news, I stopped myself: we're not speaking at the moment. At least for a few weeks, maybe for good. I did send him a short email, but I immediately regretted it. I deserve what I'm getting right now and I know it. Still, knowing he's proud of me is important

**Here's the tl;dr**: If you have love, but it's absolutely true. So for those of you who are smothering your significant other because of an underlying lack of personal satisfaction (and you know who you are), take a step back. Take stock of what is important to *you*, create fulfillment for yourself, and then enjoy your relationship for the ways it enhances your life. And for those of you who are being smothered, show your significant other this post. There's not much I wouldn't do right now to tell my boyfriend how sorry I am, but I have to sit quietly with this for a while and let my actions sink in. I had love

I ended up confronting her when she got home and told her I knew that she had been texting him so much the past week and what was going on yadda yadda yadda... She swears that it was just a friendship, and she said that she didn't know what would happen the next he came into town if he wanted to go out again, because he was a friend and she didn't want to hurt his feelings.

(Ex: her and I talk about parenting and that kind of stuff, whereas she can talk to him about her life growing up (i already know about her growing up), work stuff that I wouldn't understand)   and that it's just nice to have that conversation

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is a throw away account obviously

Last week my wife went to California on a business trip for work, but she kept texting someone the whole night we were having dinner and ignoring me.  When we got back to the hotel she was talking at the bar with some girls from her class and I got her phone out while i was in the room and read the texts.  Basically just flirting and nice to meet you crap, blah blah blah... The rest of the trip she stayed on her phone texting him, I know this because i looked at the phone records and all day Friday, Saturday and Sunday were texts sent to and from him!  Her phone is always on silent now, which it didn't used to be, she doesn't go ANYWHERE without her phone so I can't look at the messages. She also set up a private GoSMS box for his number

When I ask her who she is texting she will give me some person she works with, or so she says) since she is the coordinator of this machine.  I expressed my concern to her last night that I was worried about tonight, but she insured me I had nothing to worry about...I didn't tell her I knew she was texting him non stop all weekend and calling him, but she still made it sound like she didn't know him, and the dinner was going to be awkward but I find that hard to believe since she probably knows him pretty well by now by all the texts.

The restaurant they are going to I have a friend that is a server there.  I'm going to get in contact with him today and see if he will do some surveillance for me and let me know when they leave so I can see if she is going anywhere with him afterwards. I also set up the family link on On*star today so I could track her car.... Do you think I have anything to be worried/am I going to far?? anyone have similar type of stuff happen

Frank started out typically bitter, early twenties. After that, no physical intimacy is normal. This we laughed off because, after a decade, my wife and I have an even better physical relationship than when we started. Frank doesn't, apparently, too bad for him but whatever.

However, hint hint. My wife's close friend (who is also her ex, this is relevant) was catering the party, overheard this, and helped steer the bewildered and now angry fiancé out of an altercation.

This pissed Frank off so he started asking who the caterer thought he was and discovered my wife dated him before she met me, based on (I'm sure) that none of his exes can actually stand him. He begins spouting that if exes are friends it means they're really still dating and just want to screw each other.

At this point, but I'm not okay with having this clod spouting off further.

First off I want to say thank you to all whom provided advice

The consensus said I should just to a quiet exit. No contact to/from her. Just disappear. Perhaps grab my things while I disappear. I was going to follow this; I appreciated Reddit for the advice. But

Instead I got back together with an old friend that knew both of us. She was the one whom set me up with the GF as a one night stand. The friend didn't plan on me having a full blown relationship. (more on that story if you want).

The advice she gave me was

Saturday. Late afternoon. Packed her stuff from my place

I put her things on the front porch. Walk in with 1 black empty garbage bag. She's lying on the bed woken up from her nap.

To paraphrase

""Look at me in the eyes when I talk to you.""

""I didn't expect much from you. I was happy with this because I was happy with you. However


I got up

To reflect on my decision. I think I made a good one. I've only had 4 nights of restless sleep thinking about the break up. Partied hard that (last) weekend with the friends. Last night was the first night I had a good sleep. I'm really surprised how fast I'm healing. I'm actually wondering if I'm healing correctly or too fast. 

What if I'm just in denial of the pain. Maybe I can cry about this sooner or later to just let is all out and take it's course. I did feel like crying in the beginning. I don't know why tears were not dripping. I catch myself having a moment of desire to weep

Also, this point of story in my life may some how come back to haunt me in the future.

* My girlfriend is overly emotional

* She is incredibly jealous. Ever since we've been going out I've been neglecting my female friends because she gets mad when I'm with them or speak with them. Jealous to the point of inquiring me about girls I know just from common acquaintances that may salute us on the street. Who is she? From where do I know her? Why is she so smiley?  
Any time we're on a social place she asks me if she's the most attractive girl on the room. And don't I dare commenting on other girl's attractiveness or damned be I. 

* She doesn't listen much to other opinions. I don't believe in spiritual connections and all that spiritual stuff? ""What a disappointment"".

Hey Reddit...
Long time lurker here...
I've read almost all of the ""I caught my SO cheating"" posts looking for the perfect solution to resolve my new problem. But, the reason for my post and request for some advice and ideas.

**td;lr:** Cheater in my friggin house

Backstory:
The lady (heh) and I just moved in with each other this past month (going on 4 weeks now). The relationship is 8 mos. old. I'm 36, but after you hear the rest of the backstory, it seems I completely misjudged the maturity level on this one. (I feel like a total schmuck)

So, marriage was being discussed, etc. We decided it was soooo good that ""hey, let's go ahead and shack up!"" ""let's try this out!"".

Well, the hand holding, texting and most lovey dovey-ness dried up. I immediately felt the chill in the air and began investigating the situation... I chalked it up to cold feet, stress of moving to a new city, etc. The cooler temps kept up no matter what I tried to do to relieve her fears, her stress... but, as you will later find out

About a week after her moving in, one night, she went to bed early, without so much as saying goodnight, and then on my way to the bathroom I peaked in the bedroom and heard her clickity-clacking on her phone texting someone under the covers... WTF?

The next morning I confronted her... asked her (once again) what is going on? Who were you texting? She claimed, I scaled the conversation back and tried to just trust her.

So, she was talking to her jackass brother in law and... wait who is this guy... oh shit, F, F, F, F... an entire month of flirting with some guy in her old town... I miss you's, thanks for the other nights, so callous... I felt like some one punched me in the stomach and a red rage was seething out of every pore.

I confronted her right out of the shower... told her she had to end it, to contact him once more and end it, then report back, block from FB, erase him... then it spiraled into the conversation of regaining trust, forgiveness, I love you's. Things went ok for a week as I (we) pretended all was good (and texts seem to have ended). Then issues started back up

Fast forward to yesterday... big argument about unrelated issues, and lo-and-behold there were continued love notes to this dude.

So here we are... she doesn't know I know yet. And I'm asking you guys for advice on how to conduct the ending and eviction of this ""girl"" from my house and life. It hurts like a ton of bricks landed on my chest

The issues that make this a sticky matter are really that its (oh boy) Thanksgiving weekend with both families and she really has nowhere to go here in town.

I just want to rid her deceitful face from my view... halp.

**EDIT:** I forgot one very important question

**EDIT 2** 

Reddit, I'm just drinking 2)

So

I will calmly confront her tonight, and if she does ask why, I will calmly tell her ""you know why"" as Ymodem-G suggested. 

Tomorrow morning, that it is up to her to explain what ""being faithful"" means. I will then ""walk"" to my family's house, help cook, hang out, soak in the love… and walk home with a full stomach of turkey and a few good beers and pass out… dreaming of my new venture into the life of singledom… or maybe of finding that beautiful woman I can trust and who loves me back.


**EDIT 3**

Ok you rubberneckers here is the situation thus far ;)

I choked last night… yes

I calmly told her that she is going to need to leave. That it's the end of the line. She of course got defensive and asked why

She of course lied to my face repeatedly… and then even called the whole thing stupid… even called the guy she was flirting with stupid and meaningless. WOW.

I asked her if it was so stupid

The FB stuff came up… I did not admit that I saw the messaging, then she could show me her FB messages… nope, wouldn't do it. I know I probably shouldn't have gotten into that, but I couldn't help it.

Anyway, randomly packing up stuff in no logical manner… I told her she needs to just make an overnight bag and go be with her family, but she doesn't want to do that… for obvious reasons. She claims she can find a place to stay tonight and she will figure it all out tomorrow…. unfortunately, I don't believe her.

I'm just sitting here biding my time till she leaves… 
I'm a bit worried about her mental state

It's embarrassing even to type... I finally gathered the courage to read up about it on the net and check out some discussions here on reddit. It seems that everyone's focused on the birth-defect thing. But I'm not interested in having children and neither is she. She has a daughter already from a previous marriage and I have no children.

She told me last night about her feelings and that she wants to be with me. I don't know what to do. There's such a massive taboo involved here

So, we argue and we fight. Usually it's because I'm trying to calm her down by either letting her talk and trying to listen by not saying much or telling her jokes to make her smile or telling her how much I love her and how we will have better future. She always find a way to start an argument out of these things like, I'm not very supportive because I don't talk. I'm insensitive because I'm always joking around. I am lying to her about loving her and there's no future. She always make me break up with her saying that she's no good for her every time she realize what she's done. She keeps blaming herself for all the problems yet she won't stop doing that. I understand that it is her nature to do that and I learned to deal with it. But her guilt overpowered her and always telling me it'll be best if I break up with her. It's been like that for like four months now. Well, yesterday I said ok if you want to break up, let's do it and I said yes. Now, she's been calling me the entire night and I haven't pick up her calls or reply to her messages because I don't know what to do. I don't want to break up with her of course. I love her a lot. But now she's saying sorry over and over. 

What should I do?

TL:DR: As title said. What should I do?

Update: Good news guys. I talked to her yesterday. She said she wanted me to be happy and that if I break up with her

It was a big misunderstanding between us. We both love each other very much and we were thinking about each other and did something that was supposed to help each other but instead

1365113526.0,1bowuh,[25/m] Newlywed wife (25/f) nearly destroyed marriage in a few days..wants a second chance.,albertvii,73,12,53,"Hey people

I'm going to post a lot of information/backstory here here so please bear with me..

I recently got married back in September, after getting courage to ask her out I actually got rejected from her...3 times. I ended up finding myself to be in the 'friendzone' with her and pretty much stayed that route until after high school. We went our separate paths and didn't reconnect until 2010 (which about 4 years has past since seeing her), she had a baby girl since then and baby's daddy was a straight up psycho (been in jail numerous times, stolen cars, firearms, jewelry, sells drugs which at the time was pot, has an anger issue and has a real grudge against me just for being in the presence of his daughter..but I didn't find this 'information' out until later in the relationship)

There is a lot of 'filler' in between leading up to this point

My wife has problems communicating, I'd rather not talk about this now"", or ""I just want to start my weekend, I really don't have time for this"", or ""Can I have a few minutes of silence?""...when it came to finally talking to her after patiently waiting until it's a better time to talk (sometimes a day or two later) she'll usually respond with ""Well, what is there to talk about? I don't see what the big deal is""...this instantly got on my nerves.

She also takes personal inventory on my actions..my personal life, when I come home from work, I'll spend time with my family for a bit, then jump on my Xbox 360 and play Black Ops II, after the first week of being married, I really started feeling like there was something wrong...like an uncomfortable feeling you would have, I'd ask my wife simple questions like ""How was your day?"" or ""How are things?"" and it'd always be the one word response ""Fine""

Of course nothing was fine, it continued this way for about 3 months and the entire time I was second guessing my entire actions, it really ate at me. If I spent even a half hour on my computer I'd feel judged, if I fired up my Xbox and played a few games of CoD or something else, I feel like I should be pleasing my wife somehow..if I went to a friends house even I'd feel like I'm passing opportunities to spend time with my family..this drove me nuts I felt like I wasn't doing anything right when doing this, but this WAS my life before I got married...then she blew up at me. All this time second guessing myself just got confirmed, and the entire time I constantly asked her if things were fine which she would always say ""Yup"".

This really bothered me and I started having my doubts wanting to be there, having any talks with her weren't working, she wanted to avoid them by making excuses, and when it came to me putting my foot down and saying ""Tough, this talk needs to happen"", she wanted to leave. But it didn't stop there.

As I tried making things better, but reject me from getting any kiss, she'd give me the cold shoulder then go to her daughter and be all loving, and affectionate..I hate to be jealous of that as her daughter is only 3, but it did bother me that I never saw the affection she'd give her daughter and not me. Things only turned more from there..

She started talking about how having more kids would be a hassle and wanted me to wait another 5-10 years before having kids (this sucked because she had a kid with someone else already, and she can't give me a straight answer that she really wanted to have kids at that point), she knew this bothered me, but she kept by her word saying she didn't want to have kids at least not for a long while.

She ended up going on Craigslist posting personal ads in the platonic section to find friends to hang out with

Example: ""I want to hang out with someone other than my husband and daughter

I instantly talked to her about this since I actually found out about it, but she refused to hang out with any of her friends on facebook or any of her other friends she already knew, she wanted 'new' friends..preferably from the internet. I told her from this point, to tell me these things before she goes and posts things online.

**Edit (Left this out in my initial post): My wife also constantly would set up plans to go out with her friends and keep me out of it** When she did go out..she'd give me weird stories of how her friends and her met some guy and the guy was so drunk they gave him a ride home and tucked him into bed

When I heard this she was planning another event the following weekend, I'm going to do it anyways."" At this point the loyalty disappeared. I gave her my ring and said ""If you want to go and leave the ring off, I'll leave mine off"" what was even worse of her was when I took the ring off she mentioned ""doesn't that make you feel relieved?"" ...no, it doesn't. 

I was pretty hurt, I didn't respond back.

I had problems keeping the relationship healthy at this point, but just proceeded to not tell me..and I wasn't proud of my marriage at this point, all I could do is complain.

Early March, I asked her, ""Are things okay?""

""Yup""

""You sure?""

""Yeah.""

""...are you sick of me?""

""Yes""

""Do want out of this marriage?""

""Do you?""

""Kinda

She went silent at this point

The biggest kicker to me didn't happen until two days after saying ""I'm thinking on leaving""...early in the morning (still sleeping in the same bed with her) an e-mail alert on my wife's phone woke me up, it's a website that is specifically set up to start an affair and meet with other people), she had an account and everything. I cornered her on this and she tried to defend it saying she set it up when she was with her Ex years ago, but it didn't explain that I never saw these e-mails from Ashleymadison until recently, my trust is gone at this point and that following weekend I moved all my stuff out.

At that point I talked to her parents

She ended up getting the divorce papers and a day before going to the courthouse to file them, and she wanted to apologize for everything she's done, she suddenly had her moment of clarity when we got the divorce papers, and now she wants to work things out.

I'm currently living at my parents and she went to California to spend time with family and she ended up blowing up my phone saying that she would like to talk things through and see if I can give her a second chance, I still knew her for 13 years and if I say ""no I don't want to come back"" I'm cutting ties with a friend I knew from my childhood and on top of that saying goodbye to her daughter too and will likely never see them again.

OR...I can give this whole thing a shot, and this made me feel better when I started living at my parents, my wife tried to flatter me saying that I'm the best thing that's ever happened to her, and she needs me, and now she wants kids, she is willing to work out communicating, she doesn't want to go to the clubs anymore, and she'll remember to invite me next time she goes out. She's pretty much stated the things I wanted to have but it wasn't until NOW she mentions this.

I'd like to hear what you guys have to say about this

**TL;DR** - Ended up marrying somebody I had a crush on since middle school, I felt constantly judged and that she took inventory for things I was doing, (playing video games, or hanging with friends..even though my wife said things were fine she still blew up at me for the things I was worried about), wife liked to go online and post ads for meeting up with people, set up accounts on websites to meet with locals in our area and she wouldn't talk to me about this..I found this out. She's admitted taking off her wedding ring when going out to clubs, and more recently found an e-mail listing matches to a website that is specifically set up for the purpose on cheating with your significant other (ashleymadison.com), would constantly avoid having talks by making excuses that things are too inconvenient to be dealing with my problems


Should I give her the chance or not?


**Update 1** Holy crap! Didn't expect so many responses, and its good to know I'm not the only one who thinks that leaving is an appropriate route to go down.

She's willing to do counseling now, then you see the dark evil side of this person and it shatters your whole perspective..based on your comments, it just helped confirm it more.

I'm smart enough on the kids subject and won't jump into having a child to save a marriage, it was something I wanted from the beginning of being married, glad that didn't happen)

There is something about Chloe, and she's oblivious to the fact that her reactions to them could easily be construed as her flirting back. I trust that Chloe won't cheat on me, but she regularly crosses social ""boundaries"" and I fear she's going to put herself in situations that could escalate from awkward to downright dangerous.

Case in point: we went to a Super Bowl party yesterday. One of the guys there came up to her and introduced himself and was asking her about herself etc. She happily chatted away, but he kept his eye on her the rest of the party. As we were leaving he said goodbye to her and that he'd like to keep in touch and asked if she was on Facebook. She said she was and he could find her on the host's friends list. It took less than an hour for him to add her as a friend and he has already asked her to hang out and maybe see a movie with him.

I explained to her how that made me uncomfortable and how this guy was clearly hitting on her and, ""he saw us together, he knows I have a boyfriend."" When I said that it obviously didn't matter to him, she asked if I thought she would cheat on me. I don't think she would, so her reasoning is that if it takes two to cheat and one person doesn't want to, where is my concern?

She agreed not to carry on additional conversations with this guy, I worry she'll get herself into a situation at some point she can't reason her way out of.

She always asked this question before but I was never sure on an answer because I dont want to marry unless I have a stable job and could support my family. (we're both students)

She said she was getting tired of waiting (mind you we're both 25).

We had a long talk and the problem is that we are not compatible. I am thrifty and enjoy outdoorsy stuff and kind of emotionally detached

We always have fights about these topics every few months. And when I get pissed off at her, but I still want to make it work.

Turns out within the 6 years we were together,"" which is what her mom said). 

She said when we were first together

She attributes these changes to me

She says for those reasons

She said the first 3 years we had a good relationship but the last 3 it started going downhill. I did feel the excitement in our relationship dying but I trusted her and thought it was a stable relationship.

I'm in denial right now. I can't believe it. It feels like someone is playing a joke. But I asked her repeatedly and she says we cannot get back together. We slept in the same bed last night and when I tried to snuggle she'd turn and push me away. I tried to hug and kiss her this morning and she turns away.

She acts different now when I talk to her, which is weird cause just a few days ago we were close. I feel bad. She was always someone I could depend on and trust, and now shes gone.

We just signed the lease to rent a 1 bedroom apartment for a year. So I'm living with her for a year. How can I win her back? Should I pursue her? And what do I do if she starts bringing guys over?

I want to give her space and respect her

To me it just doesn't makes sense to throw away the last 6 years of experiences we've had together. But she says we've tried to make it work and I always end up forgetting within a few months and the spark dies.

I chalked it up to some kind of alien death flu and just dealt with it because my job is extremely crazy right now and I don't have health insurance. Then about a week ago I started puking all the time. The only things I have eaten for the past few days is saltine crackers and bananas.  I mentally ruled out pregnancy because my boyfriend and I use protection and I bled (though looking back on it now, very lightly) right when I was supposed to get my period. 

My coworker convinced me to go to a free clinic today before work and they had me take a pregnancy test 'just in case'. Well reddit as I'm sure you've guessed by now I'm fucking pregnant. They did an ultrasound to confirm the pregnancy and the first thing the nurse asked was 'Do you have any twins in your family?'. My grandma on my mom's side is a fraternal twin and I have 2 sets of cousins on that side of the family who are also fraternal twins. About 30 seconds later she drops the bomb on me. I'm 8 weeks pregnant with triplets.  A 1 in 8100 chance of naturally conceiving triplets and mother nature decided I'm the girl to do this to.

Finding out she cheated:
http://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/ifkb2/i_was_right/

The emails I found were only one days worth of corresponding. She seems infatuated with the guy, family, work) all are shocked as we've always been seen as a couple that seemed unbreakable. Tons of shock and awe I guess you could say. But in explaining my 'deficiencies' these were all the same things that everybody deals with in a marriage and are so minor (i.e. leaving clothes in the bathroom after showering). Myself and others were confused as to why these little things could escalate into a full blown emotional affair. For me there were a lot of things that bothered me, made me annoyed, all the same things she was saying but I in no way thought about leaving (let alone cheating) on her because of them. Everyone said ""It makes no sense"" which is exactly I how felt. 

The crazy thing is when the dust settled and she gave her reasoning she still tried to act as if they were just friends, how we'd split in a divorce, said she loves him, was meant to be with him, wishes she met him a long time ago, that they're perfect and have so many of the same desires, that he opened her eyes and she finally found what she was looking for

She actually said to me that ""I was happy just not 100%"" in apologizing today

I also want to mention the comment I made about ""I am a really good guy, or treated her bad and honestly feel proud of how I treated her with such respect."" I am not saying that statement alone makes me a good guy. I was tired, emotional, and laying on a couch alone (around 4:00am) opening up on here, but I know in my heart (I really have nothing to prove either way) that I'm a really good guy, and that all those things are true, but that was my way of saying that I've never done anything blatant to make her do this. In fact I have countless emails, and she said it all the time how wonderful I was of a husband, etc she told me how the girls at her work were jealous of her because of how great her husband was and said she always bragged about me. I don't want to stay on the high horse here

Anyways, last night was the toughest, I had no sleep, had a 1hr nap, woke up, and felt emotional, it was just so many emotions and everything mixed I couldn't contain myself. I took a walk and then got my mom to meet me so we could chat, and although I am a forgiving person I don't know how on earth I could ever trust her again as I still feel like she's lying and still don't know the truth. Our split of assets is going good

Through an unrelated set of unfortunate family events a trip was cancelled this week that my mom, it'll be a nice break and a great start to a new life. 

One of my co-workers suggested I look into counselling I think she thinks I'm keeping my emotions bottled because I was in an upbeat mood, yeah there are times where it just fucking sucks, and you're dealt some bad blows, things happen good/bad, and it's all about how you respond, but for me and this is the most important being angry, upset, this does suck in terms of losing someone who really meant the world to me,False,

If I were to break this group down into stereotypes the 5 guys would have gone something like this;

1) Relatively good-looking trendy 'life of the party' guy. (1st one to break the ice and start conversations instead of standing awkwardly) progressively got a little tooo drunk....

2) Super awkward guy who compensates by being the know it all...yet still very nice and entertaining

3) Sports guy (ski racer dude) better looking than he knows....yet he kinda suspects he may be a hottie....but still shy.

4) Software engineer guy...super friendly and interesting (yet totally has a GF)

5) The ""nerdy"" guy. Book guy....smart

SO cut to a little later in the evening when Mr. Uber creep decides to hit on my BF and I. We are never really good at these sorts of things and can't get rid of him politely. During this time the awesome group we were hanging with drifts slightly away (and in all honesty looked like the shunned puppy walking away sadly). All except guy 5...who I look at and indicate that we would appreciate a hand...

Guy 5 dives right in. Is friendly

Cut again to the end of the night Guy 2 tells my BF that the rest of them want to invite us over but don't really know how to do it. She tells him that we wouldn't come over...so sorry. (Just not the type to go to random dudes houses at 3am...not that we wouldn't want to hang with them again....)

Guy 1, and 4 all start heading to the door and guy 5 lingers to say goodnight...there was the awkward moment where neither of us are sure what to do....and then it gets toooo awkward and we just say peace out.

WHY OH WHY did he not get my contact info???.....why oh why did I not offer it....dang it....opportunity missed and I go home and cuddle my cat.

Cut once more to today....when finishing my Xmas shopping with another friend....I see guy 5 walking down the street....unfortunately on the other side....but we wave and shout a conversation across the road....which is awkward for both of us...and once again the opportunity passes and we again go our separate ways.

Curious to put my newly acquired secret santa internet stalking skills to use I used the knowledge of his name and where he worked to find his work number and email address.

How creepy is that? Would he be freaked out if I sent him an email being like....""soooo I kinda thought you were cool....coffee?""??

I should mention that I hate making the first move. I know that is terrible in this day and age and I will attract the ire of feminists and guys alike....but I just like feeling like a girl and having the guy ask....so this maneuver of mine is quite out of my comfort zone....but I very rarely meet guys that I am interested in....WHAT TO DO REDDIT!!!???

Him: 27, employed as an engineer.
Time together: 3 1/2 years. 

A little background: we met online. We have been living together for a year and a half, and we do not combine finances.

I am finding it difficult to explain what the problem is in a brief enough paragraph that everyone will read it. But suffice it to say

He is extremely cheap, and has complained bitterly multiple times that he has to spend $250 on a tuxedo for the event. This is someone who takes home $5k a month, and has no debt except for the house and his brand-new sports car.

However, one a 2013 sports car that is not) and an italian motorcycle that recently needed $1000 in parts. The motorcycle recently sat for a year before fixing it because he needed to obsessively search ebay for a ""good deal"" on parts.

This is becoming a real problem. There are things that need to be fixed in the house that he bought and pays for, faster italian motorcycle. He wants me to split the repairs to the home, but I refuse to because I do not have equity in the home and I am not an ATM to pay for things that he doesn't want to spend ""his"" money on. Last year I ended up paying to renovate the kitchen because it needed to be done and he was saying he was too broke after putting up the downpayment to spend the $2000 it cost to do it ourselves. I found out later that last year he had roughly $20k in the bank-- at least, until he blew $8k on the down payment for his sports car.

This has recently become a pressing issue because we have been talking about getting engaged. We have actually been talking about getting engaged before he bought the house. I agreed to help him choose ""our"" house etc on the premise that we would be getting married.

I recognize that 3 1/2 years is not a particularly long time to be together before getting engaged, and the house. I pay more than my own way, including paying all the utilities for the house since he pays the mortgage, and aggressively paying down my student debt because the debt ""bothers"" him and he claims it is a ""detriment to our future"" when I would argue that buying $50k+ in motorized toys is worse. Cest la vie-- let's just say I am not a drain on him financially and I have never asked him to help me out.

Anyway

New Years Eve 2012 came and went

His birthday came and went without a ring. A few days after that I asked him if he remembered the promise he made me. He basically said ""what promise?"" and then said if he did promise that

A little backstory on the ring: I don't want anything fancy. He KNOWS I don't want anything fancy. We've picked rings together and the price for the one I wanted was $1150. I do not think this is a substantial sum for someone who saves roughly $2k a month

So anyway

Am I wrong to just think that this is not happening and I should pack up and move on? Marriage is important to me and I have been clear about that from the beginning. I love him very much

My boyfriend, lets call him Alex, decided that he would make an off-hand comment when telling Jeff how he needs to find a ""sane"" girl that has it together.

1358720885.0,16yaay,So someone pissed all over my laptop,dbarts21,66,11,61,"Hi RA

 Early this morning I come back home from my friend's dorm.  I went to go check my laptop for Facebook and whatnot. I notice that the green light isn't on on the charger which is plugged in. I open the laptop and liquid starts pouring out from it. A lot of it. I run and grab a towel and start to mop it up. It's a fowl smelling liquid. Long story short, and then closed it because the top of the laptop wasn't wet at all.

My roommates all deny it and they say that the people they had over Friday night (I was gone most of that night as well) didn't do it. I hadn't used my laptop since Thursday so I don't know when this happened. The last thing I did with my laptop of put it on my desk and plug it in. 

Now after talking with with my roommates some more I have this information: 

Roommate #1: very
""I'm sorry this happened, and I don't think he'd be able to pee on my desk and laptop with out standing on a chair. Which he would have fallen off. Also he isn't one to get super wasted so I don't think it was him. 

Roommate #2: tried cocaine Saturday night. Got very drunk the night on Friday. Got defensive as well. Asked if I was sure I didn't do it. (I'm sure I didn't. I came back on Friday slightly drunk, I was completely sober). 

Roommate #3: seemed genuinely surprised. I don't think it was him. 

Friend #1: Was over Friday night when I was out. Was ""wasted"" that night according to roommate #1. 

Friend #2: Over Friday night when I was out. Was ""wasted"" that night according to roommate #1. Does ""crazy things"" when he is drunk according to another friend. 

How do I go about confronting them? I've talked to my roommates

I've always been one to get lost in relationships with women - doing a lot to keep them happy - often at a cost to my own happiness.  Unfortunately

The woman I'm married to is a great person.  We have been together for about 5 years and married for 3.5.  She is caring, and quite attractive for her age.  She also has a son (15).  We tried to have a child together a couple of years ago but it didn't work out for medical reasons on her end.  I get a long well with her son, but he still has a father out there and really needs nothing from me so our bond isn't that strong.

To top all of this off, I'm something of an introvert so making new friends isn't something that comes naturally.

The point being - I'm starting to feel like I can't handle things anymore.  I feel very lonely but I don't know how to deal with it.  The age difference has started to bother me more and more (even though from a purely logical perspective it makes no difference), nor a more deeply interdependent relationship with a spouse as often occurs with childless couples.  In addition, I'm a low-brow male and seeing attractive young women is a constant reminder of how things could be different....grass is always greener I suppose.

I feel like I need to get out of this situation

I could ramble on endlessly with details

I reach for it and give it to her. While I give the phone to her I make it wake up so she'll be able to read it right away and then I see that it's from a number that's not in her phonebook. I don't think much of it and give it to her and she grabs the phone fast in a nervous way like she's trying to hide the display from me. I ask if it's from her sister who she often txt with and she says it is. She then turns back to me while txting her sister which she openly shows me.
There's only one problem. The last message from her sister was received hours ago and the most recent txt was sent to her by my gf. Also when she's done texting I get to see her inbox for a split second which shows that unknown number as the latest txt. After this she doesn't let me get close to her phone and freaks out when I grab it. She never had a problem with me using her phone before.

So reddit


Update:
I asked her face to face why she acted weird after getting the txt. She were acting like she had no idea what I was talking about. When I told her that I know the txt wasn't from her sister she suddenly remembered that it was from her friend who got a new phone recently with a new number. The funny thing is that her friends old number magically works today. When I asked to see the txt she handed over the phone without hesitating. However

So the conclusion is that she's lying and definitely hiding something and she refuse to tell me what it is even when pressured. Despite all this I don't think she's cheating. Definitely going to keep an eye out for more suspicious behaviour.

Anyways last year I managed to some how get a girlfriend by some miracle. For some reason this girl was one of the few people that I didn't get very awkward and anxious around. Everything just kind of clicked and we started going out and it was great. 

We had been going out for a year, but I really get confused. 

Even with my family we don't really share affection with each other. While growing up my parents rarely if ever even said things like I love you to me

Over the past year these complaints kept building up to where she told me if I don't change something than we can't keep going out. We broke up about 3 weeks ago.

I guess the real problem that is I've never told her that I have Aspergers. In fact I generally try to avoid telling people at all

I really don't want to tell her though, that basically means I won't be suddenly becoming affectionate overnight.... no change = not getting back together

At the same time I feel like I have to because my aspergers is basically the direct cause of the problem. This has really been having an affect on my self-esteem and I've been depressed for like the past month. I stay up all night

So we've spent a week and a half apart and pretty much incommunicado. We have spoken briefly about things like who's going to take care of walking our dog that afternoon

She had her first individual therapy session last night. She called me before she went and asked how I was doing. I said fine and spoke for a minute about her session coming up. She got kinda mad that I didn't ask how she was doing. I told her that I didn't know what to say or ask her right now because of how weird everything is. 

I did tell her I was worried about her. She said ""Why because I'm acting crazy and being like daddy?!?!"" I told her I didn't say that. Obviously that's in her head. I said I was worried about her because she is going through something right now and trying to figure out who she is. She didn't say much about that.

So anyway she went to her session. Afterward she called me to tell me that the therapist had changed the date of my session and our joint session. I asked her how it went. She just said it was fine. Didn't say anything else. So she told me she'd see me in the morning.

So this morning she comes in to get showered and ready for work. I asked her how she was doing and feeling and she said she was kinda sick and had been for a couple of days. I asked how her session went

So I've gotten ready for work and she's about ready to leave and I asked her if we could get dinner tonight or sometime this week and talk

I said ok.

We talked about other stuff for a while before reaching (what I think) the main issue in all of this is. He thinks that I am 'emotionally distant', but it's hard to tell right now. He did say he wanted to try and make our relationship work, but that he thought we needed some time apart. He's staying the night with his sister, and we will talk again tomorrow.

This is one of the first nights I've spent alone in years. It's really weird.

My roommate Bob threw a pretty crazy house party Friday night.
Lots of people, especially at parties. Every time we have a party or a get together with alcohol, she is drunk and all over some dude who varies from party to party. Many of the females in our circle (my gf included) dislike her and call her a slut behind her back.

Anyway, Carolyn is one of them. I was pretty drunk and headed into my room before passing out instnatly in my bed. Next thing, I'm awake with the feeling of someone jerking me off, I knew shit was strange right away because I could feel acrylic nails on my dick (my girlfriend works in a lab so her fingers are always trimmed). I didn't know what to do. I felt really awkward and I feel embarassed to admit that I just pretend to be asleep. I know I'm an idiot, but I was really confused by the whole situation and my body felt heavy because of the alcohol. After what felt like a few minutes I guess she just passed out. I also passed out again a little while after. I didn't even know who it was until I woke up in the morning and saw her still passed out in my bed. Now more sober, I wake her up forcefully and say ""out of my room I cannot sleep with you in my bed"". She doesn't even respond she just gets up slowly and walks out. When I exited my room later that afternoon she was gone.

I don't know what to do. Do I tell Bob? Do I tell my gf? How do I explain this situation to her? Do I confront Carolyn? What would I say? I feel too embarassed to do anything. I need advice.

tldr A drunk girl entered my room and grabbed my dick while I was sleeping... wtf.




**edit:**
Thanks for the advice everyone

Seems like no matter what happens I'll feel best about this if I just tell my gf
Some of you have mentioned that this story may emerge in a different light, making Bob a big reason why most of the ladies in our group have such a visceral disgust for her. 

When I talked to Bob he seemed to take my story for truth and even mentioned how earlier in the night she was crotch grinding another dude who was passed out on the futon. In all honesty, but I'm seriously angry that I am now left with the ultimatum of making my girlfriend feel like shit or risk destroying our relationship altogether if she doesn't hear it from me first. My girlfriend is a rational lady, but Carolyn and her direct associates have such a negative stigma in our group that I'm afraid that when I tell her she may harbor a secret embarrassment due to Carolyn's notoriety. Cops are out of the question, where I live, I'd very realistically be laughed out of the precinct, maybe with a fine for thinking they gave a fuck (sorry, I've had several unpleasant experiences with douche police men).

Last night I was having a drink with my GF of nearly three years. She is 32 I am 27. We were talking about all kinds of things

About 5 months ago I moved back to the same city as her. Before that

So we are talking about the relationship

So I asked her straight up ""Did you sleep with anyone?"" She casually said ""Yes

It was also her delivery. She was very casual about it. She made it seem like it was no big deal. Like it was ""just sex"" and a ""one time thing"".

I ask for details. Who was it, it happened later."" She says this even after telling me that she told him she had a boyfriend. 

It is also worth mentioning that when she did this

She said things like ""I needed this"" and ""I don't understand why it matters to you."" All these things kill me when I think about them. I loved this woman. I thought about what it'd be like to marry her, alone, and just naive about the whole thing.

EDIT: I want to add here what she said in response to me bringing up my thoughts on this relationship being really long term. She said she started to think about all those things after she did this and cut the guy off. I've been meditating on the whole thing today, to realize she wants to be with me and take me seriously? Talk about a stinger. Communicating with me about it would have been the better route, I think.

Several people thought I live in Japan. Me and Fujiko live in New York. She's half Japanese, you really do have to watch yourself on the subways if you are a woman. They also have a lot of very weird game shows. Someone also seemed to think that Asian women were ugly. To each his own, but Fujiko honestly looks a lot like a [younger version of this.](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_HKkc8LVCxA0/S8gf5cBjBMI/AAAAAAAABpA/Kh3cbZ6PO3c/s1600/maria-ozawa01.jpg) (Don't ask for an actual pic please. I respect her privacy online. She's not even on Facebook because of privacy concerns.) I'm a little surprised so many people thought I was trolling in my post-a lot of people seemed to think I had nothing better to do at 3:00 AM than to troll reddit. Personally, I would have rather have been sleeping!

So, and I went over to see her. We went up to her room, and I sat her down and said, ""We need to talk."" So that's what we did.

I told her that firstly I was worried about how she was going straight from her father's house to me almost immediately, because after her Dad almost died, he had given her the reigns to her life. Basically, since she was 15, she's been increasingly paying her way for as much as possible while still doing well in school, and she's not overly close to him-he's more like a good friend than a father to her now.

A related worry we discussed was that in college, and that she wants to get into dental school far more than she wants to spend time with ""people who place short term fun over long term gain."" I asked ""What if I become one of those people who place fun over gain?"" She said that she knew that I would not, and honestly, she's right-I've spent too long struggling in school to flush dental school down the toilet. She also added that as a wife, she looked forward to growing with me, no matter what direction that went, even if in the end

I told her that in college, that she was okay with it. (On a personal note, I don't think I would ever want to date anyone else. I've wanted Fujiko for as long as I can remember!) I told her I was worried that if we separated, it would automatically be my fault, because she was so sure she could make it work. She replied that she would be certain it was her fault, since she can sometimes be very cold and emotionless.

I then told her that I wasn't comfortable with a marriage that was a business partnership. She replied that any marriage that lasts is a business partnership in the first place, and that goal based marriages had a far higher rate of success. Then her voice changed. If you knew her, you would know what I mean, but usually, she has a very matter-of-fact way of saying things. That matter-of-factness was suddenly gone, and it threw me for a loop. She said, ""UtterlyConfusionated, and while I may not love you as a husband right now

I asked her why.

She replied, and to be happy for yourself before I thought to make myself happy. So when I knew you had chosen a life that would make you happy, and that my dreams didn't require you to change yours, I knew I could finally tell you how I felt.""

Then she went back to her usual voice, I know you want it too, and we can make it work. It's a good business move, and it will work out perfectly academically and romantically. We're not even making it legally official until we graduate college. But as far as I'm concerned, I'm your wife and you are my husband. Let's give it a try.""

So I said we would. You can use your imagination to fill in what happened next and for most of Sunday. Suffice to say

We had our first date! 

There is a really great restaurant the next town over that I've been to a few times but that she had only heard about and was very interested in going to so that's where we decided to have dinner on Saturday night.

Needless to say I was pretty nervous (and I had to work that day early in the morning so I was kind of tired too). I did buy her a really cool lollipop (flowers just didn't seem right - I know her well enough to know that much) and gave it to her when I arrived at her apartment. 

She looked beautiful too. She had painted her nails to match her outfit and though she isn't a make-up wearing type of girl

We are both pretty casual but I did but a new sweater and some nice jeans

I sort of got lost looking for her place but was maybe 5 minutes late and she was looking for me anyway. She invited me up to see her place and meet her dog before we left. Funny thing was

I suppose the thing people are most worried about on a date is that they won't have anything to talk about but we had no trouble chatting and laughing as we drove to the restaurant. By the way

I suppose the most difficult part of the date for me was some basic interaction stuff. Sometimes she would hold her gaze at me a bit longer than you would with just a friend and I kept thinking ""Oh, what do I do? Do I stare back at her? How long do I gaze into her eyes? Oh, man, she's beautiful ..."". 

It wasn't that she made me uncomfortable - just the opposite really, but as the night wore on I got better. I mean, I wanted to make that connection with her too, I'm just badly out of practice.

But we had a great time anyway. We talked and laughed and told all of our crazy

When we were done with dinner the check came and she made the move to pay for her part but I said I'd really like to be the gentleman and pay for both of ours so she offered to leave the tip and that felt right so that's how we handled that. I know sometimes this can be a big deal for some people but that's how we did it and that was fine for both of us. 

One thing I did notice, I don't know if ""nervous"" is the right word but she was playing with her hair a lot and kinda rocking back and forth and being kind of fidgety. I wasn't sure how to read that. I mean, she still wanted to be there because we were still working on desert (we split a cheesecake slice) and she wasn't acting bored, she was just doing the stuff I guess maybe girls do when they are nervous but like someone too? 

I guess my lack of experience here is probably evident but I didn't get any bad vibes or anything - I just didn't know how to read the situation except that she's not used to dating either (I'm not sure if she's had a boyfriend before or had dated much either) so she might have been nervous how the date would end or something? I don't know. 

So I drove her back home and though I would have been very happy to do something else

So I dropped her off - sorry

Anyway, I don't know how long. 

So that was on Saturday. On Sunday at work I was still feeling that ""high"" but was kinda wondering ""so

Well now it's Wednesday and I had not seen her since Saturday

I'll take that as a good sign :)

OK. sorry this ran so long. I guess I really don't have a point here (except to wonder about some body language stuff) but I wanted to follow up with everyone from my last post and thought this would make a nice record of a fledgling relationship or at least how a date can go when one is nervous and inexperienced and still working on birthing that raptor :) ",,t5_2r0cn,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/auubf/last_week_my_inner_man_raptor_awoke_heres_an/

Then I found pictures of her engaged in group sex,mmmmf type stuff.  If that wasn’t shocking enough I then checked her cellphone to find out that she regularly used adult friend finder, and had dozens of hook-ups right up until we met.

The plus is that she hasn’t bothered with any of that once we’ve been together which is fine.  I get that she had her own life

Just after our wedding she started to shout out some other dudes name while we were having sex.  She invited this guy to the wedding.  Going back to her phone logs she had an EIGHT YEAR relationship with this guy.

I confronted her on it

I can’t even begin to tell you just how much rage that unleashed in me, but I fear I don’t trust myself to do so in a clear and sane manner without giving death threats.

The two things that keep racing through my mind is that she never told me about all the group sex (which I’m not cool with nor the long term relationship that seemingly can start again at any moment.  

Worse to me is that this country is all new

I’m going to lose a LOT of face if I try to leave as I went through hell to be here with her.

I just keep feeling like an idiot as it is clear that once she realized the eight year guy wasn’t going to have anything to do with her in any serious manner she then found me and lured me in; and that as soon as he returns she’ll do anything/everything to hookup with him again.

It really troubles me when she says that for the last eight years she wasn’t in any relationship because she gave up on love

The worst thing is now I don’t trust her.

I promised myself and her that I will not give up on us as long as I love her and because I still do I am taking all of your advice and comments (until the part where I dump her) and give us a trial run.   
She has acknowledged every issue and agrees with you guys about her being inconsiderate and has apologised. Now here is what I came up with for a plan so far: This week we tell each other what we dislike about each others behaviour, all you have to do now is follow it through"". After that hold on to each other until new years to see how we're progressing. 
All in all we are gonna give it all from both sides (She mentioned that I'm becoming lazy and I agree with her, and if she follows through with her word then we are going to have a lot of fun together.**

My girlfriend of just over 1 year just told me that she ""can't be bothered getting in the mood"".   
  
She knows that I would sometimes have to go and masturbate just to relieve myself and she is completely fine with it
  
When she is drunk - sex is a must! There is no way out of it for me. If I say no, ""I'm letting you fuck me!"" and it sucks to hear, because that is not who she is... She's a sweet girl who hates cursing. So when drink is involved she changes drastically.  
  
Generally when I start complaining we have 2-4 days where we have sex every time we meet. After that there's always some sort of excuse to avoid any intimacy involving nakedness.  
  
Today I tried to talk to her about it and she kept asking if I am breaking up with her
  
Last thing: what really hit me was that a few days ago she had her usual drunken horny mode on and I started playing with her, but came back falling all over the place, drunk, at 5-6am.   
  
Sorry for the long post. This is basically what I told her this morning as well, although I do love her very much!  
  
Can someone give me some advice on what I can do to fix this? I don't want to lose her

Yeah, she doesn't consume information or learn about anything on purpose, and she doesn't spend time doing anything other than Facebook or TV (too often with 16 and pregnant junk). She dislikes documentaries and has opinions on things that she admittedly has never researched (like weed being completely evil).

I always try to spark conversation about current news or something I learned recently and she's somewhat receptive but generally disinterested. I'll even pose questions to her so we can discuss interesting topics

For the record, it's not a deal breaker with our relationship and I have no desire to leave her.

Is this common? Do people stay like this forever, and questioning my own opinions on boundaries, but this seems to just not exist within her character. Can anyone make sense of it for me?

I've dated her(heretofore known as Mary) for about a year and a half. I read her text messages. A huge invasion of privacy
What led me to this conclusion was her habit of telling always saying she's ""going out with her girls"" or people from her department at our university and then, this isn't normally an issue, but again, a pattern: Mary will invite me when it really is just the girls, but I've only once managed to catch Josh at one of their outings, and he left shortly after at that. 
Furthermore
All their texts are flirty. Mary says that's just the way he is with ladies.
Between her always cutting me out when he's around and making excuses for his flirty behavior
We have an on again off again relationship. 
One night recently she took a friend of mine and one of his buddies home, blurted out ""I'm with *friend who is a girl's name*, can't talk!"" and hung up. Didn't see or hear from her until she came and crawled into bed with me the next morning. She denied sleeping with either of them, but man, I'm thinking this seals it.

TL;DR
suspected my girlfriend of cheating because of her habit of keeping me away when an old hook up is around, takes my friends home from the bar and rejects calls/texts. Denies having strange D inside her. WHUT?!

1320932334.0,m7du1,Help-- Girlfriend stuck on World of Warcraft ,onetimepostt,72,12,82,"I've seen this subreddit around for some time and wondered if I could find some help...  Would appreciate insight from both genders.  And yes

(Tried to make this shorter but failed--sorry)

We are both 24

Girlfriend and I met on World of Warcraft.  We were both in places in our lives where we lived with parents, we found each other and we became great friends quickly.  Then after a few months we wanted to meet up and, to wrap up this part, we are now living together as boyfriend and girlfriend.

The reason we were able to move out and get our lives rolling is because I got a pretty good job offer and took it.  I got an apartment and she moved in while I set her up with a job (convenience store cashier) in my area. 

The problem?  I played WoW as a hobby because I had nothing better to do.  Crap job and lived in a pretty boring place with no girlfriend.  She played more for the social aspect and the smaller novelty things.  It was my understanding that we could pursue our real passions once we were free from our parents' homes.  She loves to paint

Well, I read and write, etc.  The hours that she has at the apartment without me there, she spends playing World of Warcraft and cooking.  Don't get me wrong, I love that she cares enough to cook and spends a decent amount of time on it... but...

She has applied to two jobs in 6 months and has almost no motivation.  She owes me quite a bit of rent which I was happy to cover when she was getting situated.  I now feel, as arranged, and MORE IMPORTANTLY get into the passions she used to spend all day talking about over the internet.  She hasn't painted anything.  Hasn't read a single book.  I bought her some neat artist supplies to pique and renew her interests outside of the game... she barely used them.  

It was my understanding that she would move past this infamous time-consuming game and get on with her life.  I know I did once I moved out and whatnot.

Am I asking too much?  She already cooks and loves me... but I find her lack of motivation absolutely aggravating.  World of Warcraft is her hobby

I need to know if I should talk to her tonight about how much it bothers me that she spends time every day playing while I'm working--and, god forbid, doing something more...adult?  Interesting?  Cultured?

PLEASE give me your thoughts and input.  I will respond when I can (I'm at work) and will answer any questions you have that will help clear up the situation.

Maybe I'm being ridiculous

Thank you.

**Edit -- Just arrived at home and have been checking everything out.  I think the only thing to note is that there is some talk of depression.  She definitely started playing WoW to hang out with her then-boyfriend and some other friends that were ""hooked"".  This is about the time she stopped all of the abovementioned hobbies such as painting, I think she got wrapped up in it for her own reasons(?)

1316701679.0,knx5x,How to tell my husband his physique is making sexual attraction difficult for me to feel?,,73,16,92,"About us: I'm 30

My husband has let himself go somewhat

I exercise daily, as long as I'm sure to replace all the calories I burn (which can be difficult). I've also started doing yoga at home and will be attending classes on Sundays (they're free).

I take pride in caring for my appearance

I know my husband is self-conscious about his body. He's told me many times he only feels ""safe and secure"" around me when it comes to nudity (he enjoys being nude and is so around the house often); He says he knows I love his body no matter what (which is true) so he feels comfortable. I wanted to get some photos done with him and he refused

He has said many times he wants to get up early, smaller portions, less alcohol), but never has kept up with it for more than a day or two. I try to get him to bike with me, but by the end instead of feeling upbeat and having a sense of accomplishment, he seems to be cross (probably from exhaustion). 

He works out with a co-worker a couple times a week (I think) over his lunch break

This has made it harder for me to feel sexually attracted to him. His lack of motivation to get into shape has made more of a mental impact than his actual appearance. 

TL;DR/Question: what is the best way to start a discussion with your spouse about their weight, without unduly hurting them and making a change even more difficult? How can I help him to help himself? 

Just as an aside: the only reason I mention my own state of shape/health is that I wanted to avoid criticizing in the opposite direction, and then specify when looking for dates with men, ""No fatties! Emphasis on a nice bod! Must be muscular!"" and so on. It's just as difficult to maintain a ""Ken-like"" appearance as it is to look like a Barbie doll.

I was nervous about starting anything with someone who wasn't completely sure of their sexuality

2 months in to just seeing where it goes, but a few roommates and colleagues find out, and although they seem stunned everyone generally agrees that the relationship is a good fit. 

But aside from those few people who have found out, but she says she hasn't told anyone because she's not gay and doesn't want people to get the wrong impression of her...

My opinion of this is that she's young and nervous and has got a lot to figure out (she's 2 years younger and this is her first long relationship)
She's been working oversees for about a month now

I'm 21 in my third year at college as a film student

I haven't been in anything close to a serious relationship in 3 years. My senior year of high school my best friend since third grade slept with my girlfriend of 1 year, moved on, never talked to them again, and began living my life.

I've mapped out what I want to do with my life for the next 4 years. Finish college, but I'll see where it takes me. With all of that said, I've come to the realization that I don't necessarily need someone else to be happy. I've come to the realization that It would be better to be alone than to be in a bad relationship, but I wouldn't mind being in a good relationship. I told myself I enjoy being single, so it would take someone really wonderful to make me not single.

St Patrick's Day:

I meet Destiny (not her real name). I was working on a shoot schedule for my next production, they all kind of mutually started teasing me for having a beard, I had to grow it for a production I'm working on. We're all being super loud. So jokingly I act offended and turn to my right where I see another server enjoying our conversation, I read her name tag and say in a bubbly metro sexual voice, ""well hello there Destiny!"" She eats it up: We make small talk, I make a couple of jokes, she laughs her head off but she's also comes back pretty quickly, ""Hey don't talk to him, well theres his number call him!"" My friends are pretty funny drunk.

The next morning I get a text from her

So I ask her when we can hang out, turns out we live right around the block from each other so then she tells me that she actually got a ride to work from a co-worker that day so If I wanted she could ride with me.

We get in my car drive up the mountain near our house and look over the city in my car. I tell her my radio died earlier this week, fears, relationships, and everything. 

In my mind I'm like

She then tells me

The divorce was clean, she does fine on her own.

I take her home, pouring rain on us. greatest first kiss ever. We hung out the entire next night and the next night. No sex, or anything just some nice heavy make-out sessions. I haven't met her kid yet.

So I worked and covered the majority of our bills. Two years ago he decides he wants to move closer to a studio in West Hollywood he's been working there and promises me that he will be at the studio everyday grinding. I believe him but I caution him that the rent was too much for me to handle by myself ( I wanted to move to a small two bedroom) But I say yes...

Now... we found a new great house in a terrible neighborhood, and some months nothing. I begged him to get something part time but he always refused.

Except I found out I am now pregnant. Even with that he still refuses to get any sort of part time work. I've said fine if you don't want to pay leave... he refuses and laughs in my face. He goes on and on about how we shouldn't be paying rent anyway we should be paying land tax and blah blah blah... oh and our phones are cut off.

There are plenty of other things he does that now grate on my nerves even more now that he won't help with bills. He hangs out with a local bum who drinks 40's on our steps. he wants our son to go to a preschool next to a scary park with gang taggings all over it an drunk creep pedo's hanging out on the benches.

I'm M35 and she is F28.  Long story short I caught my gf of 4 years sleeping with her married ex boyfriend in our apartment.  She refused to leave when I confronted the both of them and I had to get the cops involved to remove them from the premises.

You guys were fantastic with your advice in my last threat and several of you suggested I needed to track down the guys wife and let her know.  I wasn't sure if I should do this thinking that the universe would dish out its own karma but the more I dwelled on how hurt I was

**As of yesterday

My ex has always held herself out to be a sweet genuine small town girl with morals and values and me and all of my friends bought it hook line and sinker.  Her christian parents think she can do no wrong.  She has admitted that her parents/sister do not know about this guy because they still hate him from the last time they dated.

I also found out that the guys wife found her number in his phone and texted her pleading with her to stop texting her husband and she is trying to save her marriage/family.  She had to then contact her cousin who is related to the wife (WV) to find out if this was true and indeed there is no plans for a divorce (even though she told me they talked about marriage/kids together).

/r/RA

I so badly want to contact his wife and tell her everything I know. I also want to tell her that if she wants my ex out of her life she needs to place a phone call to my ex's parents and explain to them that their daughter has been sleeping with her husband for the last 6 weeks despite her pleas to stop.  My ex is extremely close to her family and the fact that they knew she had a role in wrecking this marriage/family would tear her apart.

Obviously

Do I nuke a 4 year relationship from space or just let it go? I'm guessing the majority of you will say just let it go and move on but damnit if the idea doesn't keep creeping in to my brain.

I get a message at 8 pm asking if our daughter was sleeping, then another at 8:51 pm saying she was just leaving and would be home soon.

For the last week I have been away from home house-sitting for someone else. I got a call from my boyfriend this morning telling me that one of our cats (we have/had two) was gone. Two of his friends are staying over at the apartment and one of them went out to smoke last night and left the door open, so he has no survival skills and gets terrified outside. I went home immediately and looked, put up signs, etc. but we cannot find the cat and probably never will, and I am devastated.

Later in the day after I'm exhausted from hours of looking for the cat and just lying on the bed, all I can think is how unbelievable it is that my cat is gone and all he is worrying about is his image to his friends via association with me.

-Having constant pain and bleeding from an infected IUD that may have caused infertility 

-Conflicts with abusive

-I was writhing in pain in the taxi ride home after a surgery once and I was impatient with the cab driver but also kept apologizing explaining I was in a lot of pain

-Getting fired

Okay so last night we finally had what I would call an honest discussion. We had to go over our finances and what would be my responsibility and what would be hers. After all that

She said she wants to move out to an apartment. She asked if I wanted her to move out. I told her part of me did and part of me didn't

She said she couldn't do that because if something happened to me she'd still be on the hook for the mortgage and an apartment. I told her that she'd break the lease on the apartment. She said she couldn't leave because that would worry her too much.

Point being

We talked some more and went over all of our problems. I told her I wanted another chance at getting this right. I told her I would continue going to counseling and that I would continue to take whatever medications the shrink or my regular doctor tell me to in order to take care of some anxiety issues I have. I told her I was going to do those things regardless of what happened with us.

I told her I would work very hard to address every one of her complaints with our marriage

I can't predict the future

She is going to continue sleeping in our guest bedroom until she feels comfortable with sleeping in our room again. I was fine with that. I am just glad she is finally starting to come to her senses.

I open them up one by one im shocked at what I am reading, ""I'm wearing my favourite jumper, you around later for a snog on the stairs"", ""Going to Tesco's later, fancy a quick Shag"" and things like this. All the texts were from Monday last week, also one saying he couldn't meet up on Thursday. Don't think I've ever driven home so fast in my entire life. 

I honestly don't know what to do

How do I bring this up with her

Any advice

I guess this might sound silly

We have been together for 7 months (both 22 years old).

On average I'd say we have sex once a week

Well

I have to initiate sex 99% of the time, I feel really unattractive then). For example this morning I was giving her a sort of massage, then I started touching her breasts/stomach and she seemed really into it, only to get rejected when I tried to go further. She then got up and went to the shower (no, not a hint to follow her. She doesn't want shower sex whatsoever) which just really killed the mood.

The thing is

For example she went out last week

I had no problem with that

I knew if I had rejected her then

I mean, is it that *weird/wrong* to ""give in"" and at least please your partner?

I know I have done that a few times.

I have one month to decide. ,sleepingontheroof,68,13,72,"I'm 21 years old and my girlfriend of 2 years and I have been living together for most of our relationship. We moved into our own place 7 months ago (after living together on campus and later in a house with several friends). We've had many serious arguments in the last 3 months, etc. 

2 weeks ago, make an effort to be in a good mood or look nice when together, go on dates again, feel like we're spending quality time together, etc. She seemed to agree at the time but the next day she turned on the cute act in an obvious attempt to win me over. 

The day after that she confronted me when I got home from work, calling me a motherfucker and a ""bad person"". She then went to spend the night at her parents', sending me texts saying ""You can still save this"" and the like. The next day she came home and took back her break-up with me. She's also given me an ultimatum of deciding what I want to do by Jan 1. 

I've been so busy with school work that I haven't been able to give it enough serious thought yet. Some days I'm really down and can't think about anything but moving out and getting back my independence. Other days my gf and I are even more loving and physical than normal

My girlfriend is my best friend (maybe my only true friend in the city I moved to for university) and I don't want her to hate me. I don't want to move out

**Edit** Some relevant back story: Since moving into the new place and in the few months prior

**Edit 2** To clarify we have ""broken up"" 2 times before this. One of these times (the 2nd) was me -I took it back immediately. The first time we were drunk so we fell asleep and didn't even talk about it in the morning. Life just carried on as if nothing had happened

This time was different. We were both sober and she told me she was breaking up with me. We continued to argue, and I told her that I love her (I do). She then gave me the ultimatum -she didn't clarify whether moving out would mean automatic break-up, though she's made it clear that she would not trust me anymore if I moved out.

1374086910.0,1ii525,Getting married in September. Recent developments worry me. Advice needed.,ThrowawayVS,71,20,89,"Using a throwaway because my S.O. knows my regular Reddit account.

I'm a 33 year old guy and I'm engaged to be married. Actually scheduled to be married in September. I love my fiancee

That being said

I'm self-employed. I've been self-employed for the last 4 years (been self-employed since she's known me). As with most self-employed people, the last 5 or 6 months have been really tight. Just been a tough time. Deals that I thought would close fell through, unexpected expenses came up that I had to pay for out of pocket ... and with a limited income coming in, finances have been tight on my end. I see a light at the end of the tunnel. My pipeline looks promising, but I want reap those rewards for another few months.

My fiancee has a good solid job. She makes really good steady money. She works in finance. To put it in perspective, just over the last year or two, but she's okay money wise.

We're paying for this wedding ourselves with very little help from others. We've had a few payments due for some vendors recently. She has a credit card and put the charges on her card. All in all it was around $4000 in charges; we're supposed to split them 50/50. We talked about it

You see

Anyhoo, ""I'm trying to figure out all that right now. I'm going to get you as much as I can as quickly as I can.""

That's the truth. Even as recently as this morning I was looking at potential income and my cash and figuring out what I could give her when.

My comments apparently set her off.

She starts calling me a ""fucking loser"" and says ""I should learn to manage my money better"" ... berating me and going nuts. She thinks I'm taking advantage of her, yadda.

I tell her she was being really terrible to me by saying that. I tell her, and whenever we have this conversation she says, ""That's okay, I'll be here when you need me and I support you"" ... but when it comes time to walk the walk, she pulls shit like this.

I try to explain to her that my pay is way different than hers. It really is. In the 4 years I've been self-employed I've had months where I've made as much as $25K

I try and be as financially conscious as I can, with other unforeseen expenses. Savings and a ""nest egg"" go fast.

Anyways, I'm always of the mindset of ""when I get the money you'll have it"", but she wants me to mention it regularly so she knows I didn't forget.

I guess that's fair enough.

Honestly though

I want to talk to her about it and I don't know how. Marriage is a team sport in my opinion

This thing frightens me. What if months or years after we're married my work COMPLETELY dries up? What if I'm in a HORRIBLE financial situation? I would think my wife should be there to support me

1354592570.0,148qst,"Together 7 years, married for 5 months, now she's gone. Advice needed.",black19,69,104, I must say that the 7 years leading up to the proposal were eventful. It was full of great memories and some memories not so great. We were young when we met, we both did our part.

The most recent break up was about 2 years ago, I was under the impression we were. After months of being apart we finally talked and it turned out that we both wanted the same thing. Did I mention that we have communication issues?

Flash forward 9 months later, you know, all the things normal couples do at this stage.

Apparently, I was irritated. I felt so upset with the fact that my wife was never around that I couldn’t hold it.

I was done.

The day of her brother’s wedding

She was done.

I guess that conversation really made her think about how things were going and she slipped into herself and shut me out. She has a habit of compartmentalizing things. It’s the way she is and it’s the way she always has been. By the middle of September, with no real discussions being had, I force the issue of talking again, and next thing I know, she’s quit her job and is planning on moving back home (5+ hours away) by the end of the month.

For those playing the home game

Here is my problem. What do I do? I still absolutely love this woman. To clarify

I would do anything to make our marriage work.

I have no clue how she feels.

I said my vows and I will not give up hope on us as those words did not come lightly out of my mouth.

I don’t know if the wedding vows mean a thing to her.

I frequently have a hard time on a daily basis.

She’s just ‘doing her’ back home.

Do I move on? Should I attempt to see her (which I haven’t since she left in September)? Do I fight for us? Should I just let her be and hope she comes around on her own terms? I have so many questions. I am not capable of compartmentalizing the way she can. This weighs heavily on me daily.

My girlfriend of only a few months really likes the attention she gets from guys chasing/flirting with her. However, I feel she has nothing to hide. But on the other hand, I feel she only flirts back to the people she finds attractive/interesting, and hence keeping her options open. She says she finds our relationship really refreshing that I'm not always keepings tabs on her (unlike her previous boyfriends) and she enjoys the freedom... however, I'm actually quite controlling, and so I'm actually in the process to change.    

Another thing that's troubling me is how fond she is of her ex. She's told me on more than one occasion of how they were perfect together, and often sends texts like ""Hey, I miss you"" and lengthy, emotional texts when he sees her with other guys. She's also told me she feels like they have a pact/race to find a significant other that's able to replace each other. **I'm 100% ready to commit to a serious relationship with her... but I'm not sure if she's ready to leave her past behind.** I sometimes feel like I'm the 2nd best option, after her ex, and it makes me unhappy.

It's a frequency-of-sex question -- typical

First, married for 11 of those. We're a happy family with two lovely little boys, ages 3 and 6. We're both college-educated, debt-free, and gainfully employed doing meaningful work in non-profits. We don't make a ton of money, but embrace our Midwestern ethic of living within our means, and enjoy living in a city that has plenty of cheap and free things for couples and families. We're blessed with tons of friends and wonderful, and have a very active social life, so to speak, maintenance

We've been through counseling once, gave us a safe place to talk, and helped us cope with an extraordinarily stressful workplace situation that I was understandably but inadvertently bringing home with me every day. (FWIW, I can't recommend counseling enough for couples in distress -- set the pride aside, and just do it! It saves marriages!).

In any event, at all in our marriage. We love each other unto death do us part, as they say. I can honestly say that we're each others' best friend.

So

My wife and I are each others' first and only sex partners. We came into the marriage having experimented with everything else, and she gets more beautiful by the day.

So what's the problem? Well, and we have sex reliably once a week, on a good ole'fashioned 'date night.' It's fair to say that we live and die by our calendars, and the frequency/reliability of our sex life fits right in with that.

But I wish we lived a little LESS by it -- I'd love to have sex just ONE more time a week. Small potatoes, has been extraordinarily difficult. When my wife says that she's tired, I know that it's not just a line -- we both work very hard, and often well into the night (thanks, non-profits!), and it's the absolute truth. But nevertheless, I'm a man, and a wife who I find irresistible...and I just don't know how to make this happen. I might ask from time to time, that if it's not a 'date night

I suppose it's relevant to add, that we're likely to have sex most, if not all days.

So, without seting her on edge, or making her feel like she's somehow to blame for something? You can't believe how much my mind and body would be set at ease, if I just knew that from time to time, that we might be intimate just one more time a week!

I got incredibly mad at him and he apologized and said that he should have asked me before. I told him that I don't like to have pee all over me and that he shouldn't do it again.

Today the same thing happened again. I was sleeping and he peed on me. I am furious

Me: F
Boyfriend: 30.
Together for 8 months

I get home from work on Tuesday, what to make for dinner, etc.  I get on my laptop and see that my boyfriend had left his google voice history open from the day before.  Instead of just clicking out of it, I find myself a little curious so I click on the History tab.  I don't know why I did it, I really didn't expect to see anything.  He leaves it open while at his apartment all the time, so it's not like I've ever had a reason to think he's hiding anything from me.

Well lo and behold

The next one that comes up is from this past Friday, skip way ahead and see something from March.  It's a long texting correspondence between the two, pretty harmless but still somewhat flirtatious. It took place just a few days after we had gotten back from our first vacation together.

At this point I am shaking, let it ring once and hang up.  I wait 20 minutes and try to calm downm, but instead feel worse, the most horrible thoughts going through my head.  I want to puke.  I'm thinking the worst of the worst.  I am ready to break up with him.  I call again, he answers.  I am calm, I explain slowly and clearly what happened.  I am clear that it was not my intention to go through his history, but when I saw her name I freaked out.  I didn't look at any other correspondence with anyone

He tells me that I am reading way too much into this.  Yes they have been talking recently, he was drunk that night. 

He calms me down, but he claims she always initiates it.  She is still having a hard time with the breakup and is a very needy person.  And he says that while he knows that things are over between them, it is still hard for him.

I start to relax a little. When I ask him if he has told her about our relationship, he hasn't.  This gets me riled up again.  How can he correspond with her, for months, and not say anything?!  Surely she has asked him, especially if she is as needy as he claims she is.  He says that he can't tell her because she will freak out and in her classic manipulative way, tell all of their past mutual friends and set them against her (whatever, grow a pair!).  He also says that their breakup was very difficult for both of them.  I am understanding of this

We make plans to meet later in the week (tonight) and talk about it more.  After we get off the phone I feel better for a few minutes, can't sleep.  I compose a long and thought-out email explaining how I feel.  I say that it is disrespectful to both me and to her to not tell her that he is in a relationship.  It is dishonest.  It certainly isn't helping her to move on with her life. 

As I am writing the email, he hasn't been open with me, but that I have to understand that after he broke up with her, he wasn't sure if he ever wanted to put himself out there again.  Due to his emotional distance, I have also made myself somewhat distant.  And due to this, it feels good to talk to her once in awhile.

I love him so much and I want to work this out.  He says he wants to try to.  But I still can't get over this, I love him enough to try my hardest to work past the whole incident.  I just don't know how confident I am that he feels the same. 

I don't really know what to do

Edit:  I am off to his place for the talk.  Nervous as hell because I have no idea how this will go.  Thanks to everyone for your advice.  I feel stronger now and am confident that I will do the right thing if he can't prove that he's going to commit to me and only me.  Will update with results.

For the past year or two, and says very shallow, closed minded, and downright mean things. He has been significantly less empathetic and seems unconcerned with the goings-ons of everyone around him.

He's even withdrawn from me, and only sends me a few text messages on the days we don't see each other. 

I am not making this shit up that you are about to read.

Today, and what kind of education they have. He stated that he was no longer interested in emotions or attachments to other people, and that if he ever had a family, he would just give them a lot of money instead of getting too involved with them, because money is what makes people happy. He said he has always been searching for someone who would understand that he is ""socially and emotionally inept"" and be okay with it. He said he expected to die alone and that he was okay with this. 

He is obsessed with computer science, and that this was his only contribution to society. He kept talking about how he was not interested in emotions and feelings, stating that all they did was cloud logic... He said he was only concerned with himself and dedicating his life to computer science.

She had a miscarriage and rather than tell me she decided the best thing to do was to get pregnant again before I found out. When I did I broke up with her. This lasted only a few months until she had our daughter. I would go to visit and it broke my heart to leave every time and eventually let her move in with me again. 

Fast forward to now. I have a business

She refuses to grow as a person in any sort of way. She constantly brings drama we don't need into our lives by lying constantly about things that don't even matter. However

Help me please. What do I do? I'm so inexperienced in life and feel like the only way to be safe is to make money and provide for the family. I have no problem doing this but I'm depressed and always tired from the long hours. Oh god I feel so helpless.

What do I do?,weightlossmarriage,71,16,109,"My husband and I were having a heart-to-heart today about unrelated issues when he opened up to be about the fact that he isn't happy with my weight loss. When we met, he tried pressuring/talking me to agree to gaining weight to get to 170-180

**EDIT:**

After a really shitty night

He asked if I would be resentful if I went to 160-165 and I told him honestly that I didn't know. I never once thought he would be unsupportive of my weight loss since he was there helping me along the way.

I just don't know why this is even an issue. I prefer muscular men. My husband is 5'10 and 130 lbs. So what? That's why I just can't figure out why this is such a big deal to him.

I love him, but it's worth a try. I'm at 145 right now, so it's not a big leap. My main thing is he's needed therapy for his anxiety for awhile and hasn't wanted to seek help. I did tell him that if I gain weight to 160-165 and am unhappy, then I won't stay at that weight.

**EDIT 2:**

I have written a letter to my husband, it is the right decision. Whether that will still be the case next year, no one knows. In case anyone is interested, here is the letter: 

""You hurt me last night even though I know that was not your intention. It doesn’t help that we had just discussed and worked through my feelings regarding the fact that we never do anything with one another other than walk, you tell me that you would rather I was healthy with loose skin than morbidly obese. I feel like that was all a lie. I feel like the last 3 years were for nothing and that you have lied to me for our entire marriage. We are husband and wife and I’m deeply hurt that you kept such an important part of your thoughts away from me. 

For once in my life, what then? If I go back down to 145 pounds, we are back where we are now. If I get to 165 pounds and am happy, will you eventually start pressuring me to gain more weight? 

There is nothing wrong with preferring a certain build, your wife. I should not have to physically change myself in order for that to happen.

Now that I have aired my feelings, I want to go with you to your session because I need to learn how to properly help you with your anxiety. This joint session can also serve as marriage counseling because I need someone to talk to about all of this. I have no one to turn to since you have requested it stay between us. Marriage should not be this hard, and I believe that counseling can help us. Two, I want you to discuss and consider anxiety medication with your therapist. I know you don’t want to take medication, but anxiety is an actual mental condition that can be treated with the proper medication. It is no different than bipolar disorder. Medication will no more negatively affect your body than birth control affects mine. Your first prescription will not be the perfect one. It takes time, but I want you to discuss it with your therapist and seriously consider it.

While not a requirement

I hope you will consider everything I have said in this letter and know that I love you. I only want what is best for you

**FINAL EDIT: When I got home from work today, I haven't considered what weight I would truly be happy at. Frankly, I'm not happy at my current weight because of loose skin and stretch marks. 165 was my goal weight at one point because I remember being happy at that size when I was in high school. I love food and in the process of getting to 145, I have spent 3 years critiquing everything that went into my mouth. I lost the joy in food. 165 is just a number like 145. I will still be healthy at 165. I want to thank you all for giving me your advice, good or bad. You allowed me to put my thoughts to words and formulate how I did or did not feel.

Now onto the update.

I broke up with her. We were arguing on the phone the day after I posted the original, to calling me and begging, to being a total ass cause I wasn't giving in. We haven't talked much lately, she has texted me apologizing quite a bit though. 

I am happy, which I'm sure is normal. I mean this is my first real relationshp, and my first real break up. I don't have the urge to go out hook up, I haven't tried talking to girls that have literally thrown themselves at me since I changed my Facebook relationship status, lol.

Now my husband, its the next day. He says I should give him some slack because he's tired.

Rewind a couple of months before we got married/lived together

Fast forward to present day and he's doing the exact opposite and what's more, prepare his lunch for work, pick up his things, AND work full time---I just feel like his mother after that. He doesn't show affection or show me any respect; he just leaves his stuff around and getting him to do housework is a challenge. After all that... I just don't feel like sex. The fact that I have to pick up his dirty underwear to put in the hamper is a huge turn off.

His reason being is that he works in retail and just wants to relax. I would like to relax

Does anyone have any advice? I'd like to save my marriage. We just started and I feel like its not going to get any better. I want to feel like his lover again and make love with him--not feel like he married me so I can be his mother.

Since the first incident, etc etc. Since then I've worked very hard on improving my communication with him, and it doesn't seem to have made the slightest impression on him in the end.

That's all beside the point. I believe in second chances

The problem is his family: ***I love them.*** So, and a generosity so overwhelming that it hurts. One of the biggest regrets I have about ending this relationship is the likelihood that I'll lose them, and they're the closest thing I have to friends and family in my big university town. I have a feeling that once we officially break up, he's going to give his whole family a very watered-down version of the story.

My question is, as well as how much I value my relationship with them, but to also explain my reasoning for breaking up? I realize topics such as cheating and breakups are such intimate affairs that normally shouldn't extend to unrelated family members. However, I feel like once he tells them his version of the story, whatever that may be, they'll want nothing to do with me. While of course, family would have to side with family, and that I wouldn't stand for it. At the very least, and that I don't want to entirely lose my relationships with them

**TL;DR, and want to at least remain on friendly terms with them. Would it be wrong to e-mail them explaining(leaving out the explicit details) why I decided to abruptly break up with their son before the holidays?**

*EDIT: Everyone is right. I have decided that I will contact them by sending them a card, I'm not trying to make them pick sides. I'd be lying if I said no part of my original intentions was out of revenge, but I acknowledge that acting out of petty, angry revenge solves nothing.

During that time, etc etc. It's not unusual to meet a ton of new people at these events, including young people like herself. But he made friends with her outside of it, and then started texting her.

Well, I saw his texts, I'm a horrible girlfriend - his phone kept fucking buzzing so I went to see who was texting him while he was in the shower, and it was her NONSTOP jesus christ - normally we have no issue sharing texts though, I read them to him and vice versa if driving / whatever) was texting her saying ""I can only text you at work, my girlfriend can't find out."" 

WTF. This was the same day we almost broke up (first time), and then made a commitment to each other to get out of that hellhouse, as we realized it was a lot of the problem.

I didn't say anything. I was pissed, etc. He comes back in the morning, goes to sleep. I'm a mess at this point, so I read his texts - and he had been texting her all night. Nothing sexual or flirty, but he invited her to come hang out that following evening at work. She asked if I'd be pissed if she went, and his response was, ""If she found out

Needless to say, we discussed depression and various problems, etc etc. He cancelled on her, so she never stopped by. His reasoning was I'd be jealous, and so he didn't want me to be upset, then realized how fucking stupid that sounded.

So now you know the backstory to this girl.

She's actually very nice. As I've gotten to know her, and this girl is around the same age, so I'm thinking she's a replacement almost. His sister and him texted all the time, and I've seen their convos - nothing nuts.

Buuuuuuuuuuuuuuuut...

She has a HUGE crush on him. I can tell. I've been the 19 year girl with a crush on an older guy, but she's *trying*.

Mostly I tease my boyfriend about it now, he keeps hanging out with her. I don't want to tell him he can't have a new friend, but because of 1.) the age discrepancy and 2.) how they became friends and **I** found out about her, it's been really fucking difficult. She's been nice enough to try and include me when she invites him places (sometimes), but she got drunk the other night at her party she threw, and was practically all over him. 

Is this a no-brainer? Should a 28 year old man not be hanging with a 19 year old girl? Or am I being a jealous girlfriend and need to back off? I need some advice here.

Also - we've since moved out of the hellhouse. Things have been MUCH better since. Less / no stress

**tl;dr**: Boyfriend is hanging out with a 19 year old who had a poor introduction. I want to let him have his new friend, but I can't tell him that. wat 2 do?

**edit**: They are not sneaking behind my back or anything anymore. This happened *once*

**UPDATE:** I talked to him tonight about me being uncomfortable, and then said he's never had girls chase after him before that didn't become his girlfriend (ie: no one's gone after him / flirted with him while he's been in a relationship), so he doesn't really understand how it works. I'm giving him the benefit of the doubt in this situation. He said he'd stop texting her, and only text back when she texts him first.. and also cut down on how much he responds, as well as not responding immediately so she doesn't think he's at her beck and call.

Not sure what to do, but I'm on the verge of ending it and feel like I'm breaking my own heart.",RitzWolf,13, I'm a 30-year old male. MY GF and I were friends for several years but have only dated for one. The past year's been great, I think I need to end it…

If you knew me and her, and generally treats me far better than I deserve to be treated. No one's ever loved me this much, and I've never loved anyone else as much as her, but here we are…

In a nutshell. I love her, I think about how fun it would be to go chasing tail with my friends almost constantly. I wish I didn't. I wish I was so head over heels for her that I didn't even NOTICE other girls any more. Does that actually happen to other guys? Or is the grass doomed to always be greener over there?

If you want the details

It's hardest on the weekends. All I want to do is go out with ""our"" (aka ""my"") friends, the party, etc.) makes it hard for me to have fun. So we don't go. Or we leave early. And then I find myself resenting her cause I have to skip the fun...

Childish right? I'm 30 and still want to party non-stop. I feel like I need to grow up

I said ""my"" friends earlier, and she tends to build these psychological walls between her and everyone else that makes it difficult for her to ever feel totally at ease with most of the people I choose to spend time with… Which means that more often than not, she’s there, hovering at my shoulder when I’m trying to mingle or joke with the guys. Is it too much to want a girl who can handle herself in a crowd? Who can kiss me on the cheek and disappear in the party for an hour or two, without me constantly worrying that she’s sitting in the corner, alone and hating every minute of it?

The problem is, fun family. I myself have a HUGE circle of friends and my Catholic family is enormous and a huge part of my life. Likewise, I'd love to marry a girl with her own circle of friends, with a vibrant social life beyond me, and who could bring me into a whole new family of fun (and disfunction), of traditions and all that Norman-Rockwell crap. But she's none of those things... she has 3 maybe 4 close friends, and most of them are older and not really fun. She's estranged from her family, she spent them alone).

So here we are. I've got a girl that can light up my life when we're alone, but directionally correct. Most people truly like her when they meet her, and she can be very charming, but I just wish she was more out-going, spontaneous and dare I say it, ""popular?""

I mean

Am I being immature? Part of me thinks this is just my fear of commitment (this is my longest relationship ever)

This has come to a head in the past week or so, but EVER, then she doesn't see why we should stay together. In her defense, it's not an ultimatum and I think it's very fair. That's why I feel like I need to let her go. My life is very comfortable right now, and when she's in my arms, I'm truly content, but I feel like I OWE it to her to end it. To break her heart now if I feel that doing so is inevitable.

And the thought of doing that breaks mine.

Thanks for letting me get this off my chest. I'd welcome your advice.

&gt;For example, there was a guy who said his gf was jealous. He explained the situation clearly and included the fact the the girlfriend trusts him but the real problem was her fear of being alone (emotional issue at her end).

&gt;Since I am in a relationship with a similar problem

&gt;\*\* Reddit needs to make comments (and what you liked) searchable by text and subreddit.

##[bensbitchxoxo](/user/bensbitchxoxo)  
&gt;&gt;For example

&gt;***YES YES YES.***

&gt;My female friend went to RA because her boyfriend was being a total dick. I know both of them. I'm friends with both of them

&gt;I told her not to listen to them. I told her that working out the problem is a lot more realistic. They were a great couple

&gt;Well anyway it's been 2 or 3 months and their relationship, for like six months, they were having a bunch of problems.

&gt;When people have no emotional attachment to the relationship, when you're dealing with relationships, you have to consider emotions, and sometimes the emotional thing to do is the rational thing.

&gt;From 4 paragraphs summaries over the Internet, which is something people on RA just couldn't understand.

&gt;One other thing: I think there's a bias toward ""omg u should break up"" because the posts in RA, I could write a few paragraphs about the bad parts of my friends' relationship, but I could also write a novel about the good parts.

---

##[blargtastic](/user/blargtastic)  
&gt;The reason that people on RA are quick to suggest a break up is twofold.

&gt;First, but are tiptoeing around it. Lots of posts go ""I'm dissatisfied with x, y and z, and thinking about breaking up, please help."" That person *wants to break up*, but is to passive to just go out and do it. It takes an outside observer to say, hey, and it'll be better worth your time to end the relationship now then to struggle hopelessly with it

&gt;Second - and this is where it gets a little more sketchy - is because RA is full of people who are single and want to live vicariously through other people. This doesn't have to be a bad thing. They could realize the warning signs from a past relationship and apply what they remember to what they see with the new one. Or they could just be bitter and want the poster to end it before the other party does.

&gt;Still

##[caindel](/user/caindel)  
&gt;I actually think that if someone goes to a forum saying ""I'm thinking about breaking up"" and is clearly distraught about it, and it's not unique to the RA subreddit (which I haven't perused).  Have you ever once heard Dr. Drew (who is a complete moron, I should add) respond to a caller by saying that they should try to make it work?  Of course not.  The response is always ""the issues will not go away and you should break up and find a 'healthy' relationship.""  The things on Loveline may be veering towards the completely bizarre, but the point still stands.  The response never factors in the emotional trauma of breaking up nor does it ever suggest ways to work things out.",,False,,False,t3_b8zq9

We've been arguing a lot recently

Our most recent stupid argument was over whether I should have gone to his house to eat dinner with him and his parents. He still lives with his parents, I feel super awkward, and I've told him this. So I suggested that we just go out for dinner (which was the original plan, anyway), and he immediately became defensive. He told me that it's important to him that I get to know his parents, and that my feeling awkward around them should be something I suck up for his sake if I care about what's important to him.

I explained to him that I'd been hanging around at his house a lot lately

He told me, and yet you can't even have fucking dinner with me and my parents? It's always the same thing with you; you can't use logic. GIRLS can't use logic.""

I told him he was being immature and sexist with his silly blanket statement, but girls as a whole,"" as if this made anything else I had to say moot because of my innate inability to use logic.

I'm not sure how long this has been my issue

Despite my failings, but it evidently wasn't a deal-breaker). Sadly, a short while after the wedding I had to move away for work; things were OK and we saw each other as often as our busy schedules would allow (usually at least once a month) until she was finally able to come join me where I'd been living. during the long breaks between seeing each other we'd text a lot and have phone conversations, but as I've said above I'm not the worlds best conversationalist, so we were never on the phone long. Despite this, our relationship remained pretty strong and fresh and we survived the better part of a year apart.

Now fast-forward a year and a half. My conversational skills have matured about none; we still talk and I feel like we're connected and things are going well until about 2 weeks ago.  

(a little more backstory

The weekend workout rides had been going on for a couple of months and she had been going out with work friends once or twice a week - again, but usually was stuck working. Then, magically, I had a couple of days where I was free to hang out and go out to dinner/drinks etc! So the first night she went out and I wanted to join, but never got invited and stayed home drinking a couple beers by myself, finally going to bed at 11 since I had to be up early for work and she came in smelling of alcohol. I was annoyed at not having been invited to the fun and just kinda rolled over and went to sleep. a few nights later the same story was repeated, except this time it was after midnight when she got back.

I couldn't take it any more at this point and my suspicions got the better of me - when she was out of the room the next morning I stole a look at her phone and text message history with the guy she's been biking with. looking back though a couple of days worth of texts I see an obvious pattern of flirty texts from her with little snips of there conversations that night, but like you said its for the best"", wife'""i feel like it should get easier to restrain as we know each other better, but instead its getting harder for me...""  And thus began my guilty/sneaky habit of looking through her texts with him when she left her phone out and left the room. 

In addition, though I didn't think of myself as this type of guy, I was getting really jealous of the guy she was biking with and all the time that she was spending with him where I wasn't invited - basically told her that I trusted her and knew that there wasn't anything going on between them, but that I would like to hang out too, especially when I'm free and getting ditched at home alone...it went over well, she agreed that she'd been ditching me too much and then told me that she enjoys spending time talking with him because he actually talks; they have a lot of similar interests, work on similar things etc. That stung and made me realize that this wasn't something that was happening to me

So, basically trying to act like we were dating again and it felt like it was working - we seemed happier together, our somewhat stale sex life started to pick up again and I thought, just maybe I could be the guy she wanted. The feeling lasted for a few days until this week when she had to work late every night and was coming home grumpy and not wanting to talk much (hey, it does go both ways sometimes!). I was planning to go out and grab a beer or two with a few people from work last night and invited her to come along when she was done with work at 7:30 or 8...come 8:15 I still haven't heard from her, so I send her a text seeing if she has to stay late and if she still wants to meet up, no response. another 15 pass and I send another text, not surprizingly

When I get to the restaurant I walk by the outside tables and who should I see sitting cozily across from each other at the end of dinner but my wife and the biking guy &gt;:( she tells me that she didn't want to interrupt my night out with my friends and was planning to go with a group of people but the others just weren't able to make it/cancelled etc. I shrug it off and head inside to grab some food with my other friend
I get some food, etc...but this just feels SO bad, the things I was thinking were driving me insane), but she doen't. let. go. of. the. phone. had it under her pillow all night even which is just totally weird for her - suspicion increases.

So
wife-""oh man that was interesting"" 
him-""haha
wife-""apparently I had like a thousand texts from {me} seeing if I wanted to go to {restaurant} with him and then he shows up and I'm there with you! sorry
him-""its OK
wife-""no...Ive been pretty distant lately, 
him-""well like you said the other night,
wife-""yeah...""
him-""trust me
wife-""well said :). I guess you are involved in my distraughtness cause I can't stop wondering what it would have been like if I met you a long time ago.""
him-""I know. but thats a lot of what ifs. and right now you have something that already passed all the what-ifs. most relationships don't get that far. I think you have something pretty special. and most people would be envious""
wife-""i don't know about that
him-""you're probably right and I like that we are friends and don't want to do anything to jeopardize it.""
wife-""yeah

So, but I have a feeling they're rather rare. If he hadn't been that type of guy, who knows what would have happened by now? And what happens when she meets the next guy who she wonders about?

So, don't think it would go well for me...)? Do you think I can change enough to be the guy she wants? despite all of this, I still love her incredibly and would do anything for her (aside from letting her cheat on me - I won't take that, this ""emotional cheating"" has wrecked me far and away enough, add a physical relationship and I'll lose all composure and come unglued...). I really want to be a better communicator, I want our relationship to become better - better than it ever has been, really

We've been married 3 years, but over the past 2 years this behavior has increased to the point that not a day goes by without an argument or tantrum developing based around issues of control &amp; trust, although she will never admit that is the case.  I've mentioned that this behavior bothers me but she almost always tells me that it's a result of what I do (or don't do) in our relationship.  If the issue isn't tied up in something I've done to draw out this behavior in her, then it's because she's feeling overwhelmed with work/our baby/family obligations/etc. and she'll have an emotional meltdown and will clam up and cry.  In my head I think it's unfair that she does this, but to tell her that (and I have told her that during the crying) always leads to a bad place and more fighting.  Basically I've never been able to calmly talk to her about the issues I have without her throwing an angry, emotional tantrum or finding a reason that she's validated in doing what she has done.

The complicated part of all of this is that she does do a lot.  She works a demanding job as a teacher, takes care of our finances, takes great care of our baby, etc.  I do a lot as well, but the difference is that she uses the things she does to validate her explosive behavior.

I feel like it's unfair of me to say, ""I had a bad day with the project I was working on, and then I had to go pick up [our daughter] from daycare and rush back to get on a conference call...so what do you expect?""  But for her to say something similar is fine.


I don't think her perception is accurate or fair, but I have noticed myself walking on eggshells with almost all of our interactions lately.

I just tried to call her on this behavior about an hour ago and it ended with her storming out when I brought up why I was upset.  I assume we need counseling, but I can explain more if I've left things out.  Thank you.

He doesn't seem to handle frustration well, if we're leaving the house and I realize on the way out the door that I forgot my phone and have to take 2 seconds to run back and get it, I get a sigh and an eye roll. Spill a glass of water?  That's a sigh and an eye roll.

Other than that

I've mentioned that this bothers me and that I'd like him to be more patient with me

My question is:  Is this something I should push back on more assertively?  If so

I am not sure how to handle that because it makes me feel as though i love her much more than she loves me.  As an example, with a passion, but i would enjoy watching it so much with her because i know it's making her happy.  I would quickly find pleasure in her enjoyment.  Her being happy would take priority over my distaste for the show.  

However, but it won't have the same effect on her, she won't find enjoyment in my pleasure.  So much so that her tolerance level for doing things she dislikes is very limited, and ultimately she reverts to not engaging in fun activities i enjoy because she does not enjoy them herself.  

This realization is really messing with my head, i am not loved to the extent that i love her.  Any thoughts?

Our relationship is great, respect each other, etc.

The cause of a lot of our fights is her relationship with her mother.  I'm hoping to get a little insight from you guys about what, at 31 years old, my wife and her sister are both still afraid of their mother.

My mother in law is (in my opinion) bipolar.  She goes through major shifts in personality.  She can be incredibly helpful and fun

She calls her between 3-5 times every day.  I find this to be way, but if she ignores too many or tells her mom that she needs to go, her mom gets offended and takes it out on my wife for a couple days.

None of this would bother me, finding anything to get upset about and then hanging up on her.  Or just generally bitching about the same problem over and over.  Then my wife is in a bad mood, and bitches to me about all of this.

I try to encourage her to put a little distance between her and her mom.  To maybe set some limits on the number of calls, but really I believe pissed off that she's so helpless in the situation.

Yesterday I wrote out this really long account of my relationship with this man (26M) with the intention of posting it here and asking for your advice.

For all the perceived complications, there is no try.** If he wanted to be with me, to commit to me he would. It's simple. Okay maybe the real world isn't Romantic Comedy simple, but the premise is the same nevertheless.

That said, stubborn as it sounds.

**Edit 2:** Against my better judgment, so at this point, I've decided I'm going to stop taking the abuse. If she wants me back, she'll need to prove to me that she's worth my time, and I don't see any likelihood of this happening.

1376527724.0,1kdzd5,Should I (26F) be concerned about how he (27M) treated other women before me?,NevadaFlower,61,14,74,"We've been together for 8 months and he's been pretty honest about his dating life before he met me.  A couple stories stand out and make me seriously want to re-evaluate how I think about him: (1) he went out with a girl he met online, just unprotected sex) when she had the impression he wanted to get married

This man was very up front about what he wanted early on in our relationship, always posts pics of me online, frequently talks about our future together and has started to slowly move in with me.  Despite his obvious enthusiasm about me, I can't help but wonder if the way he treated those other girls is actually a red flag, or if this is normal behavior for a lot of men that they would never disclose to a significant other.  In terms of our relationship he has been very enthusiastic about the possibility of having children with me, though I made it absolutely clear that I would never even explore that possibility before marriage and would immediately have an abortion if impregnated.  He said that this was absolutely understood, and we have never had unprotected sex.  Even so, because that was an unbelievably cruel thing to do to someone.  

tl;dr: My bf was a total dick to other women but treats me like his queen.  Is this cause for concern?

EDIT: Clarification on point 3: he is pro-choice, not to be a single mother. And for those asking why he wanted kids so bad: he's simply always wanted to be a father. It's what he wants more than anything else in life. When we had been together a few months we started getting into deep, detailed conversations about how we would like to raise our kids. After awhile, and given that previous incident with the other girl, I said I had zero intention of having kids before marriage and that I wanted to avoid talking about child-raising until a more appropriate time. He agreed and we've been more focused on the relationship itself ever since. ",,False,t5_2r0cn,True
