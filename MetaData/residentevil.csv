AMA,TakeAimPictures,41,4,56,"My name is Coleman McClung, I'll be shooting the largest independently made fan film based on the Resident Evil franchise.

Thanks to awesome productions such as ""Portal: No Escape"" and ""Halo: Forward Unto Dawn

Our film: ""Resident Evil: Arklay, multiple practical effects and SAG associated actors, things get expensive very quickly. Even with the dedicated investors who already believe we can pull this off, we still need more help from the fans. So we're going to do a quick forty day indiegogo to collect the rest of the funds we need to completely immerse you in the atmosphere and story of the classic first game in the series.

Check out our project page at: http://www.indiegogo.com/projects/resident-evil-arklay

Then come back here and ask any question related to why you should help out and what makes this more than just another fan film.


tl;dr - You're awesome/we're awesome; lets make a movie.

I really enjoyed the Leon campaign. It was kind of a throwback to the original series in a way. Being able to shoot and walk is always a plus. Being able to kick is nice also. I have a feeling that you can run out of ammo very quick being able to fire as fast as you can pull the trigger. So does this mean no more gun upgrades? Overall I think I will enjoy this campaign the best.

Next was the Chris campaign. It is basically Call of Duty within the Resident Evil universe. I'm not liking this one at all. It doesn't feel like a survival horror which the series should be. I can only hope that it gets better throughout the game

The last campaign was the only one I died in. That is because I got trapped in a corner being attacked by 2 raptor type creators. I couldn't even get a shot in before I was killed. I think this is my fault for trying to fight through a hoard inside of trying to sneak by

I'd like to hear what your thoughts are when you get a chance to try the demo. I just wish the whole game could be the Leon style.

Many years ago when I was a small boy, what I thought was, awesome Sega Saturn to play some games. After dying many times in Panzer Dragoon and struggling to figure out Myst (I was a dumb child). I saw Resident Evil's case.


 
 
 
Now my dad raised me on horror movies since I was little (even younger than here in this story) and I loved it. Seeing a zombie on the cover interested me, Kenneth? maybe?) and stared at you. I practically shit my pants. [warning: extremely dated and not scary](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fe6srxp1-9I) I jumped up and shut the console off. 


 
 
a year or two later, so I wanted it. My dad had recently visited a black friend of his, and I only say that because the only memory I have of this man is that he was the southern version of Wayne Brady. His friend showed him Resident Evil on his playstation. This is why my parents refused to let me get Resident Evil 1 or 2. 


 
 

 
Understandably so


 
 
  
  
Forward a few more years and it's Christmas. My dad hands me a gift, but a token of my dad showing me he knew I could handle whatever was thrown at me without peeing myself or going insane. Together, and with some of my aged relatives, we played it over a summer weekend and beat it. 

That is my favorite memory in the series, much more so than Birkin to me. 



Also back then I thought every zombie on the screen had to be killed so I died to Nemesis a lot.

I have been a die hard Resident Evil fan since 2002. It was the first M-rated game that I played, I was severely disappointed.

This is where people come in and tell fans like me to shut the hell up because Resident Evil needed a change. I have to agree that the gameplay in the older games was getting stale

Resident Evil 5 was NOT well done. It was not scary; the AI was terrible; and Co-Op was NOT necessary (that itself took away a huge portion of the scares). Resident Evil 5 turned the series into a simple action game with no horror that only tried to play off the success of 4. I recognized no Resident Evil aspects

I have many friends who started playing Resident Evil as with 5, and they tell me to shut the hell up and accept that the series had to change. I do know, however, that others who are saying this are not fans of those games, but of others.

To this, but everyone else would say, ""Shut up and accept the change!"" which, I'm guessing, you would not.

The Resident Evil change feels the same way with us fans. A lot of us don't like where the series is going because we feel betrayed. We helped the series get to where it is now

So, and we hate to see it get hurt like this. If you only played 5, you have no right to tell us 5 was better than the others. And don't tell us that the series needed changes if you aren't familiar with the other games.

If you liked Resident Evil 5

TL;DR: Please don't tell Resident Evil fans to shut about about the new direction the series is taking.

I've played the 3DS version and it's one of my favourite RE games not to mention one of the best 3DS titles so I might be biased

I think it looks pretty good. Character models look great. The texture quality could use some upgrading and it runs extremely smooth, closer to the pricing that Rockstar did for the PS2 ports of the PSP GTA titles, $20-$40. For $50 I sort of expected a little more work. As it stands it really is just a graphically upgraded handheld port, plays nearly identical to the 3DS version. The once filled environments look a tad sparse on a 32 inch screen.

The demo was extremely short. It might be because I know that part of the game well but I was done in about 5 minutes. It's barely a full chapter. If it was me I would have chosen a more eventful chapter or included two chapters

Controls were very smooth, it plays even better than the 3DSXL with the Circle Pad Pro LL which was previously my favourite way to play this game.

For the $50, which IIRC is actually $10 more than the 3DS version even though it's one of my top 3 Resident Evil titles.

My reasoning for this is that, and those who like the action seen in *RE5* and *RE6*. Whenever a new game comes out, there's always one side that can't wait for it, and another side that is less than enthusiastic about it. How a side feels is determined by how the game in question plays, of course-- is it survival horror, or action?

Capcom tried to please both ""factions"" with *RE6*, what's going to make you think that you aren't going to make it through the next area? Don't get me wrong, though; I love *RE6*'s controls, but they really aren't what *RE* needs as a survival horror game.

This brings me back to my point: the *RE* series should branch off into two styles of games. The first style, *RE5*, and *Revelations*, while the actual gameplay would focus on saving resources (Having to think of if you should kill the enemy in front of you, or if you can't afford to spare the bullets) and scaring the player (Partly by making it feel like the challenge isn't passable, or like it's extremely difficult). The other style, on the otherhand, and would focus almost completely on action. While the story and atmosphere might have horror undertones (Fighting monsters/mutants in dark areas, that could still be included in both styles of games-- thanks to the controls

So what do you think? I realize that the series is sort of already split this way, I think *RE6* was the right step towards a fun action game, even if it had an identity crisis by trying to please both kinds of fans.

2. Shooting a zombie in the head with an entire clip of handgun bullets and it's still coming at you. Wtf is that bullshit? And I'm not saying the special zombies

3. The game taking control away from your character to show you something important, but the entire time it's showing you this; a zombie is inching towards you so that by the time the video is done, it's right there and hits you.

4. The campaign of Leon [consistently NOT rewarding you for your efforts. No tidbits of info or anything to make the mystery juicy. Just told time after time ""Well if we go here I'll tell you, something will happen and you wont be told a damn thing. No reward for your efforts.](/spoiler)

I like the game but there are several things that are holding it back. Unfortunantly those things are pretty major. I'll get right to it.

* Friendly bot AI. I'm sure you've read the reviews already. They are not lying. I have not seen AI this bad...ever I think. They constantly walk in front of you, ignore all mission orders, completely ignore mines setting all of them off, rarely use cover, drop grenades at their feet...the list goes on and on. Anything higher than normal difficulty with bots is simply frustrating. That said I didn't find that the enemy AI was as bad as some of the reviews. They are effectively lethal, especially on the higher difficulty levels.

* Dead players bodies ignore physics. At least 4 times I had issues where a player would die near a table or in a corner or something and their body would fall through the solid object or even through the wall. This means you cannot rez them.

* Revive/swap weapon/""stomp the shit out of"" are all mapped to the X key. For those that haven't played

Funny story

* Some of the upgrades are nearly useless. Not the skills themselves

* Juggling. Several enemies in the game have juggling skills. That is a knockdown/grab/throw etc that incapacitates your character. Almost every one of these skills ""cooldowns"" are shorter than the ""get up"" animation of your character. This means you will get perma-incapacitated with absolutely no hope of recovery. Often

* The cover mechanic needs to be bound to a key. As it is you just press against cover and your character hugs to it. The problem is many times this just doesn't work. You press and press and your character never hugs the cover. Also the dive/roll mechanic, and while your character will do that, as soon as the dive is over they stand up forcing you to press into cover again. During firefights this is bad.

I hope it doesn't sound like I don't like the game. I'm sure most of us could make a list like this of all of our favorite games. I really like ORC and want to see some patches to make this game great.

According to interviews with the devs

**Graphics: 8/10** The first thing everyone seems to look at nowadays is graphics. To me, however, and that makes the game look gorgeous. Yes, as stated in some other reviews, the surrounding areas may seem boring, but that is a matter of opinion. If you're spending your time gazing at the side of a building going 'that building looks boring and dreary', you're missing the point of the game. Anyway, though there are multiple frame-rate issues. for instance

**Gameplay: 7.5/10** Oh boy, you tab LB (or L2) BUT, you can also use this to Quick Turn and if you hold it you can use it to auto aim and auto fire your pistol at enemies. 3 commands on one button does not a solid control scheme make. Another problem is the A button (or X button) having about 4 or 5 different actions on it. If a team mate goes down, they drop where they stand (unless a grenade kicks them a few feet) and they also drop their currently equipped main weapon. This can cause problems, you see, as the button to pick up weapons and revive team mates is **MAPPED TO THE SAME BUTTON.** This only really causes distress in Campaign Co-Op, because in Mulitplayer, they'll most likely be right back on top of you pulverizing and Infecting you. The cover aspect of the game can be wonky at times. There's no static button to stick to cover; you just press you character against whatever you're trying to cover behind. Moving on to a new addition; Infection. I believe this game mechanic is a perfect addition to the series. Too long have we been bitten without repercussion. Too elaborate for those who haven't played yet; any zombie (and even the Medic class, you can use it. This gets rid of the infection. However as soon as you become infected, or a team mate comes around and blasts them hard enough to cause them to stagger. Moving on to every ones favorite subject; The AI! I'll make this part short and easy. It's horrible. Team mates walking into blatantly obvious fires and the line of fire. Blocking door ways. Taking grenades they'll never use. Things along that line. HOWEVER. The one good thing I've found with this AI is that they will try to maximize the effectiveness of the Aide Sprays. They won't be another Sheva

**Sound: 9/10** Not much to say here. I enjoyed the music and the voice acting. Except Specter. I don't get why he talks with pauses in his sentences.

**Replay value: High** Since the campaign is short and has plenty of secret loot to be found

**Overall: 8.5/10** The game has it's ups and it's downs but it's definitely a great game in the RE series. This will definitely be holding me over until Resident Evil 6 comes out!",self,t5_2s0lb,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/residentevil/comments/r8p7i/operation_raccoon_city_my_honest_review/

(There's a TLDR section at the end).

I'm not raging by any means
I'm not exactly super-passionate about this subject in particular

I've noticed a bunch of people don't exactly like the gameplay that's been previewed or tried hands-on for RE6, and they're taking the gameplay style in a new direction that's brand new for the series!

Just from browsing here and talking to people

Same with the movies!
Like it or not, with some characters that weren't in the original Biohazard series, and he took the plot in a completely different direction.
Yes, like Wesker and Jill. 

It's all different

So now the main point..

(Keep in mind this is my OPINION

I think it's hard to really call yourself a true Resident Evil fan if you let things like that get in your way of appreciating the game series.
Like I said

But.. If you're like me, but still love them, even if they're not the norm, or produced in a way you don't think really like.
I mean

But I have played enough to make an informed opinion and give my thoughts.

I'm not trying to get on my high horse here

-----

TLDR:

In my OPINION, you'll watch all the movies, and enjoy them for the simple fact that they are Resident Evil creations!

This is all just stuff I felt like writing down

Happy gaming

Gotta say... 3. I've actually never beaten it. I just lost interest a good way through. Didn't help that I've had it in for Jill since 1 either.


2.) **Favorite**
 Wesker. I think he's cunning, he's got brains to back himself and his plans up, even if he goes a little whack in RE5. I'm talking RE1 and 4 Wesker. Calm, cool, collected.


**Least favorite** 
Jill. Bring on the hate, or background. I feel like her only personality trait is being ""heroic."" I don't really know, she just bugs me on a lot of levels. And I've seen SO many complaints on Ada's dress, but look at Jill's outfit in RE3! She's fighting zombies in a miniskirt and tube top. I find that highly unethical. I'm not very logical on why I hate her so much I guess, but I just do.



3.) I feel like a lot of other people love Jill, but I feel for him, somehow.



4.) In Resident Evil 2, and shoot the bells, all that. And the fight with two el giganticas.




5.) **Favorite**  
It's between the underground basement place in RE1 where the sharks are


**Least favorite**
The fucking castle in 4.



6.) Ironically



7.) For Wesker



8.) I went as Ada once to a con



9.) I'm all for LAda, as heterosexual as I see the both of them.



10.) The logical side of me says to choose Leon

But my illogical side says to choose Wesker, but I'd probably end up dead in a matter of minutes. ",,False,self,t5_2s0lb,1376196594.0,,

It goes a little something like this:                   Jake Muller goes on a journey to discover more about his father and his associates. Thus he is told of a man named Alex Wesker. Thinking that this is what he's been looking for Jake follows this trial. He ends up on a small island in the Barents Sea (north of Russia) and begins his search in a small town (more advanced than Pueblo). The towns people would be uninfected at first but a small group of BOWs sent to kill Jake would change that. The island also features and old Soviet era Gulag that serves as a hideout and test area for Alex Wesker. Since Alex Wesker has access to almost all bio-weapons in the series, with and optional co-op partner (one of his merc buddies maybe?) as well as another scenario featuring Ada or some other character.

(MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS)

RETRIBUTION
Retribution sees the characters go through Umbrella's training facility which features artificial versions of: suburbia, and new york.  Alice and Ada travel together and set off to rendezvous with the rest of the team.

UNDERWORLD
Underworld features the characters infiltrating an umbrella facility in order to obtain a codebook to bring them down.  The group gets separated and has characters Leon and John fighting through umbrella's four artificial training facilities in order to meet up with the rest of the team.  They go through: forest, and a city area.

This usually wouldn't surprise me but the books have gotten zero mention when it comes to the films.  But yeah

TLDR: RE: Retribution and SD Perry's novel RE: Underworld share the same artificial training facility plotline.

We also know that there is a third possible protagonist [""the man to save the world""](http://pcmedia.ign.com/pc/image/article/121/1216882/resident-evil-6-20120119041014614.jpg) as they are calling him. The most popular theory is that this fine chap here is none other than Spencer's former pal Alex Wesker. He also may be just a new character to the series all together. I have no doubt in my mind, however, that his [partner](http://pcmedia.ign.com/pc/image/article/121/1216882/resident-evil-6-20120119041017481.jpg) is none other than our very own damsel in distress Ashley Graham. Her voice in the trailer is unmistakable. This would also bring in an interesting plot line seeing as Leon is forced to blow her father's,  head off. Although Leon's new partner (whom I thought might be Sherry Birkin and is actually Presidential security girl [Helena Harper](http://pcmedia.ign.com/pc/image/article/121/1216882/resident-evil-6-20120119040930119.jpg) a new character in the series) could also have pulled the trigger.

Don't forget that this game in the series is set a year prior to the events in 5. So, but Jill may be ""dead"" during the events of this game. 

Edit: Also

Edit2: Seems IGN has heard that the partner of the unknown protagonist is Sherry. I will still, so his blood is quite valuable, he was a merc, and he does look like he should. I'm still hoping for a return of Burnside or Alex Wesker and I really wonder who Chris's partner will be. Barry? Carlos? Billy? No, probably not, but here's hoping we at least hear something about these guys. ",,self,,

---
Resident Evil has to be one of the most complex games in terms of story. For years I have been eager to know more and simply just understand what was happening throughout these games.

Scouring the Internet for answers, along with [Dan Birlew](http://www.danbirlew.com) (who started the project as a fan) have written a very thorough summary of what happened throughout RE, including what is canon and what is rubbish. [Here is the link](http://sites.google.com/site/stolisomancy/replot/replot.txt).

I highly recommend taking a look if you're eager for a better understanding of the history of Resident Evil

1341652513.0,w68do,My thoughts on Resident Evil: Code Veronica,Iconoclastik,10,3,9,"So at the start of this year I decided to rediscover all the gaming gems I missed out on when I was too young. I started out with RE4 on gamecube and was blown away. That game is just amazing imho. Anyway


First of all, frantically using herbs as soon as Claire went below ""Fine"" health and into ""Danger"" (limping heavily in the process). The gameplay was just phenomonal. I've ever been as frightened or spooked out as I was in CVX. Everything from the achingly slow loading screens of the opening doors, the heartbeats as I ascended a creaky staircase just clicked with me and I drank it all in.


Secondly atmosphere was amazing. The creepy piano melodies (especially in the Ashford Mansion ... oooh!) along with the rest of the audio in that game was fantastic, the camera panning alongside me with the terrfying sound of my footsteps echoing off the walls.


I also liked the puzzles and only once or twice felt as though something was too ambiguous - when I finally worked out how to open briefcases (by physically rotating them) I felt like both an idiot and a genius at the same time which I love in video games.. maybe I'm just weird like that.


However


The controls took a bit of getting used to but I quickly worked out that they suited the majority of the game perfectly. Navigating the levels, and the final battle against Alexia in her three phases. God, that last one gives me nightmares - trying to run around these fucking tentacles that kept running up to me and stabbing me, making me lose total control. If i was given a traditional, 3D video game control method in the boss battles, where I could turn and move without first having the rotate my character I feel like my enjoyment of those sections would have been immensely improved.


Secondly, I simply didn't have enough ammo on me to kill the thing, making me wonder if I was doing it right. Luckily, I had a previous save file that allowed me to load back, collect some ammo that I missed and waste the fucker in about 10 seconds. Same with Alexia's fight - I was forced to replay about an hour of gameplay just to scan the levels for hidden ammo and weapons.


Overall


Sorry about the long post

Then in 2007 I got RE 4 for the PC. I forgave the controls and playing this was even more memorable. I had moved into a student house

I got RE 5 for the 360 when it came out (2009?). Although it was a departure from the other games, that was very tense.

Two months ago, CV and 4 were on the marketplace. I played them both again, with fond memories flooding back. I forgot how brilliantly dodgy the voice acting was in CV, and how good they both still were, even though CV was a bitch to control.

So, and am wondering if I should bother playing 1, 2 and 3 on PC, as I've had a great time with the last three games. Or has that ship sailed, and they're too dated?

There have been quite the amount of RE games handling the incident around Racoon City, if it was so major, why isn't it more frequent? I could imagine some kind of reboot for Sheena Island in a new RE/DLC for RE6, but that is only speculation.

3. The gameplay depending on the character you play as. In six they said they are going to have seperate playing styles depending on the players

4. The way zombies act. Its one thing to have a infected human use weapons and throw things but a t virus or c virus zombie that dosent have a brain throwing and hitting you with objects. No. All they have in there heads are food! Not lets just kill him.

5. Co-op! Resident evil is an alone game to scare people. I hate the fact that they have at ALL times a partner with you. In revalations they have a partner with you but he or she cant help you when your getting bit or thrown they just watch and shoot. Solo is the way to go in a resident evil game.
