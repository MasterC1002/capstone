Those are all bad habits, giving you a very flat, low-contrast image that retains the color information in the footage much better than Canon's preset styles. Once you've downloaded the Technicolor CineStyle preset, installed it into your camera, shot your footage using it, then captured it onto your computer, you'll have *way* more flexibility with the footage when you're doing your brightness/contrast adjustments, and color grading. Keep in mind

That aspect of it is quite objective, intermediate, and complex grading techniques, tips, and problem-solving strategies through either a live broadcast ""seminar"" where you can watch and follow along, or perhaps a video that you can pause and play and move along at your own pace with.

As I am looking down into the monitor nearly with my nose in the hood I feel someone place there hand on my neck. I thought it was the operator perhaps letting me know that I was nailing the focus or hoping it was the cute makeup artist saying hello. So I didn't think much of it. Within a split second I felt the barrel of a gun press to the back of my head. I was lucky enough that I quickly ducked right. 

The man grabbed the camera and two other men came from the other direction. To help I quickly ducked behind a car at which point. On of the men raised his gun into the air and fired. I can thankfully say no one was even injured but the camera was taken (about $60-70k worth of gear). 

I just want to let some of you younger guys know when you are shooting gorilla. Just be aware or make sure someone is and think twice about your location. ",self,t5_2r1ip,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/Filmmakers/comments/1gvvux/be_careful_out_there_stay_aware/

But this subreddit is unique in that, /r/vfx, or any of the other departmental subreddits, we call ourselves ""Filmmakers"". We don't simply edit clips together, we don't simply analyse multimeters and dB levels, we don't simply assemble complex scenes from vertices and splines - we *make films*. (I'm using the word ""simply"" just to highlight the independence of these various tasks, not to suggest that they are in any way easier or inferior tasks).

And making films is an artform, and all this subreddit seems to care about is budgets, equipment and tech demos.

* Next time someone asks for feedback on their film
* Next time you post a link to a film you've made - a short, whatever - talk about your tech specs, sure, but don't forget to talk about your artistic motivations as well. Tell us why you made your film - if you only make films to play around with equipment, then you are a technician, not a filmmaker.

Read some books on films, what makes a great film, what makes art in general, and use all those nuggets of information to help bring everything you do out of the realm of competence and into the realm of artistry.

And to those who suggest that talking about film art and filmmaking should be separated in different subreddits

EDIT: Sorry to be so bullish with the post title - I'm not saying that technical matters are irrelevant. All I'm saying is that they need to be complemented by discussion about why these technical matters are used in the way that they are. What certain lighting says about a character, and not just focus on the technical issues without explaining why they are issues from an audience perspective.

**TL;DR EDIT:** There are plenty of subreddits dedicated to the individual crafts and technical sides of film. This is the only one where we can - and should - talk about these technical elements in relation to the films we hope to make with them. Less of a focus on the size of your sensor,False,self,t5_2r1ip,1350239918.0,,,t3_11gkc1

I am not limited to this music I have posted here and I am fairly confident I can create what you might be looking for, dissonant, anything. Some things may be more challenging than others, but that's why I'm here and doing this in the first place.

I am also not opposed to any of the music I have posted here being used in your project if you find something you like.

Anyways

EDIT 2: Thank you all for responding, please send me a message, I'd love to work with you. 

I'm out of town for the next few days but don't hesitate to send me a message. I'll respond as soon as I can. I'll be back around the 17th or 18th and I'll be right back to work as soon as I get back. 

I made all the songs on my soundcloud composer page downloadable in case anyone has a project and they need something right away. Just let me know you're using it. 

I look forward to working with and collaborating with you all

Before we started shooting I asked the local college for help - told them we'd like to use their students as camerapeople and makeup artists

Also asked local restaurants if they'd like to provide our cast/crew with food for a day, we don't do that here.

Also asked our local theater if they'd possibly show our film there

Okay

Our film crew of 25 included this rich teenager who donated half our needed budget in exchange for a co-starring role.  Turned out he was, never listened to anything anyone told him.  He kept rewriting his lines and ""accidentally"" saying them wrong.  (We didn't know it then, but he was badmouthing the film to everyone, mocking it.)  Took a 2 week vacation out of state without telling anyone in our 3rd week of shooting - we had to reschedule around him.  Could not cut him; we'd already shot too much with him (including one crucial scene that we just couldn't shoot again).  We finally gave up and agreed to meet again when he returned.

While he was on vacation he called everyone on the crew and cast and told them that I had decided to cancel the production altogether and work on something new that he had written.  All but 2 believed him; they met at his house and he offered to pay them (they were only volunteering for me) to work on his script.  When I ""didn't show up"" (wasn't invited) he told them that I had dropped out

The 2 who refused him let me know what was going on.  I tried calling back my crew and cast - they all said ""Sorry

I have a full-time job; he doesn't - he can dedicate all the time in the world to his script.  Local restaurants have been catering his shooting days

And now

Sorry

Your camera is only as good as the person holding it.  You will harm yourself as a filmmaker if you rely on gear to fix your shortcomings, and give up before you have a chance to really spread your creative wings.

Spend as much of your free time as possible watching videos on how to be a better filmmaker.  Indy Mogul and Film Riot have some great tutorials

The thing about high-end gear is that it's designed for people with high-end skills.  When you're starting out, or a $40,000+ Red package are not what you should be looking at.  You don't need a $3000 audio setup, nor do you need thousands of dollars worth of lighting.

That said, and a microphone.

The good news is: You can do a lot without a lot of money.

In this guide, and audio setups based on 3 different ""entry level"" budgets.  I rely heavily on DIY stuff, mostly PVC tinkering.  One thing to keep in mind is that none of the DIY gear is going to look professional.  You can paint anything matte black and get some amount of professionalism, but if you show up to a paying gig with a PVC stabilizer, you're going to have a bad time.

I'm intending this guide to be something we can link new people to

Note: I ran into character limit

Los Angeles

Met a kid my age (23ish) about a month ago. We talked about the industry and I mentioned that I am a recordist. He asked me to help out on a ""Student Film."" Now, free of charge, as long as they rented their own mic/boom set up and fed me well.

Alarm 1: Yesterday I get a call early in the a.m. offering me money to come in since their sound guy bailed. I was busy

Alarm 2: Never got a call sheet. Was told last night that it would be a 7am call (and we just changed the fucking clocks)

Alarm 3: I get to set and they have no equipment for me. I tell them I am leaving. They then produce the shittiest shotgun mic possible (not even sure what brand) and a ""mic-stand"" to use as my boom.

Alarm 4: No one working on this film is over the age of 17. Except one old dude (the ""Director"")

Final Alarm: I told them I would not worry about getting paid as long as they ""feed me."" I arrive for  7am call and there is NO FOOD AND NO COFFEE.

So...I tried to use their equipment for about 2 shots. After the first location change

I feel bad for walking out,False,self,t5_2r1ip,False,,,t3_1a1kgr

###Flip Camera or Equivalent (~$200)

Most of them have a fixed lens, and they will usually have little to no customizable options or settings.

Pros:

* Easy to use.  Turn on and record.
* Inexpensive.
* Small

Cons:

* Usually poor video quality
* No user settings
* Usually no inputs for audio or video.

###Canon T3i/600D

1080p is stellar for the price. Swivel screen

Pros:

* swivel screen
* built in wireless flash trigger
* ACG disabled with no ML intervention
* ability for Magic Lantern to be installed (unlike the 7D)


Cons: 

* bad battery life when shooting video for long hours. (must use AC adapter or purchase) extra batteries
* not weather sealed

If you get this camera, you should at least upgrade to the f/1.8 50 prime.  

I recommend all people who primarily shoot video to get this camera instad of the T2i

by: sayrith


-----
##$1
-----
###Canon 7D ($1

Smaller and cheaper than the 5D.  The buttons are a little more user friendly for video work as well.  Has 720p/60 that you can conform for slow motion, commercials, and web.  NOW ACCEPTS MAGIC LANTERN FIRMWARE.

Pros:

* Shallow DoF
* 1080 24p
* 60fps over crank.
* Weather proofed body.
* Can accept hundreds of EF mount lenses

Cons:

* Can overheat fairly easily
* No pro audio inputs
* APS-C sensor.  This could be seen as a pro depending on your aesthetic and lenses.
* No clean HDMI output.
* Moire

#####Required accessories: EF Lenses, CF card reader

#####Recommended accessories: External HDMI monitor or loupe attachment for onboard LCD

#####Sample footage: https://vimeo.com/21178814#####

###Canon 5D Mark 2 or 3

Full frame video

Pros:

Cons:

-----
###Panasonic HPX170 ($3

Little brother to the hugely popular HVX200, and 1080 video at multiple frame rates and speeds.  P2 card prices have plummeted, Panasonic will release an adapter to allow for the use of SD cards.  P2 workflow is well established and user friendly.  3 CCDs = no moire or rolling shutter.  Great for events, weddings, sports, shorts, and music videos.  Very versatile camera.

Pros:

* XLR inputs
* Over and undercrank speeds
* Buttons are user friendly for on the fly shooting.
* Long battery life

Cons:

* Small sensor
* Codec is starting to show its age
* Not necessarily a con

#####Required accessories: P2 cards

###Canon XF100 ($3000) [link](http://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/733533-REG/Canon_4888B001_XF100_HD_Professional_Camcorder.html)

Relatively low cost broadcast-ready camcorder. Full featured and compact. Good for budget on-the-go video work

Pros:

* Good range of bitrates and resolutions with support for slow and fast motion, 60i at 1080.
* 4:2:2 codec and Canon processor create smooth
* Two XLR ports with excellent preamps and independent controls. Built in stereo mics are above-average for on-camera microphones.


Cons:

* Single lens.
* Smaller sensor means deeper depth of field than is currently in vogue.
* Compatible CF cards are costly per GB and the camera does not (to my knowledge) support off-board recording


by: LemonFrosted


--------
###Panasonic AG-AF100 ($4


The spiritual successor to the DVX-100, but far less moire, rolling shutter and compression issues. 1080p 60 VFR, dual card SD slots and SDI output.  Definitely an improvement over DSLRs, but maybe not the best mid-range option IMO.  AVCHD Codec.

Pros:

* Video camera features and controls
* Large sensor
* SDI out

Cons:

* Highlights clip yellow
* Micro 4/3 lenses and crop factor leave much to be desired.

#####Required accessories: Lenses

#####Recommended accessories: SDI recorder

###Sony NEX-FS100 ($4


A video camera that grew up with DSLRs and learned from their mistakes. An affordable way to get the large sensor look without the compromises of a DSLR. Great low light performance

E-mount is easily adapted. 1080p up to 60fps


Pros: 

* Shares Exmor Super35 sensor with F3 
* Video camera features and controls 
* Small and light


Cons: 

* No SDI 
* No Built-in ND filters

#####Required accessories: Lenses, ND Filter(s)

#####Recommended accessories: HDMI recorder

###Red Scarlet-X ($16


High quality 4k Raw Digital cinema camera &amp; 5k stills.  Same sensor as the Red Epic-X Available with EF and PL mounts, commercials, music videos.  Not great for live broadcasts, sports, and run and gun shoots.

Pros:

* 4k raw motion
* Extremely customizable packages
* Edit raw 4k files in adobe premiere

Cons:

* Data heavy.  64 GB cards hold ~24 minutes of footage (more if you lower the quality and resolution)
* Power hungry.  You'll want bricks on the back.  RedVolts last around 25 minutes.
* Heavy.  Once you get it all rigged up

#####Required accessories: Batteries
#####Recommended accessories: Wooden camera top plate

###Sony F3

-----

###C300 ($16


Lacks moire aliasing rolling shutter many of which plague its lower priced rivals. Include two XLR ports built in ND filters and a great 422 8 bit 50mb/s xf codec. It uses Canon log setting which has a flat color and gamma curve for color correcting. The low ISO performance is excellent going to a reasonable 20


Pros 

* Picture Quality 
* Ergonomics 
* Ef and Pl mount 
* Good Battery Life


Cons 

* No RAW 
* Only ""422"" 8 bit. 
* 60fps only 720p

I love Reddit but we need to be conscious that by submitting our ideas/concepts on Reddit we submit to Reddit's terms of service which include clauses that Conde Naste is free to use our concepts/text for their own commercial purposes.

-------------------
**Original Post**

I know there is already a thread about Redditors making a movie in terms of a collaborative effort, using paid industry professionals where possible.  When I mean beginning, I mean:

Stage 1 - **Fund Raising Round 1 - Development**

- Initial outreach to Reddit community to raise basic funding for Development phase.  Funding goals should be to raise funds to pay for a screenplay and a few industry people to assist with advising and helping manage funding requirements and plan.

Stage 2 - **Development**

- Hold a well managed screenwriting contest
- Use aforementioned paid professionals to help develop funding requirements based on selected script

Stage 3 - **Fund Raising Round 2 - Pre-Production**

* With selected script


Stage 3 - **Pre-Production**

* Funding in place
* We can use the community as a whole where possible to assist with things such as: storyboarding
* For casting we could try to work with Reddit favorites willing to take a risk  but also receiving payment for their work

Stage 4 - **Fund Raising Round 3 - Production**

* Using the funding requirements created in Pre-Production

Stage 5 - **Production &amp; Post Production**

* Again, where possible, things are kept open and transparent to the broader community.  If possible, dailies should be uploaded as well as additional information (interviews with cast, directors, etc) to keep everyone informed of what's happening with the movie.

Stage 6 - **Fund Raising Round 4 - Marketing/Distro**

* Raise funds required to properly market and distribute the film. 

Stage 7 - **Marketing/Distro**

* This is where I think we can be more original.  There could be lots of interesting ways for the movie to be marketed and distributed.. online or traditional.  Since the movie is crowd-funded, do we attempt to return money to the contributors?  Do we use any profits at this point to fund future movies?  Do we release the movie effectively free?  Of course this brings up interesting points about cast pay based on the movie's performance.  Thoughts on this?

Side Project - **Side Documentary on Crowd Sourced Movie**

* We should raise money to pay for a documentary crew to film/document the entire process


What do you guys think? Is this something we could pull off?  We all know the power of crowdsourcing funds.  Just look at what happened with Veronica Mars.  Why shouldn't we have a Reddit Film Company where WE can professionally produce the films WE select. No need to fight Hollywood

Do you guys want to be a part of this or will some other web community do this first?  Let me hear your thoughts.  Just think of how once we get the ball rolling, feature length film would be astounding.

I think it would be a good idea to bring this small community of filmmakers together, and have a reward for the filmmakers who do great work.

We can start it off by having the announcement for this month's theme, making a short film that meets the theme and conditions by the deadline. Submissions are given to the mods or a body of judges who then choose the winners in different categories- best cinematography, best acting, best screenplay, best visual effects, etc. The winners get a tag next to their name, maybe 'MotM Winner' or something like that.

Is this a good idea? It seems most appropriate to this subreddit. I have a feeling it could create some more filmmaking related discussion and a tighter community if we did... And it really doesn't require much more than moderating a few times a month.

Thoughts? Feedback?

EDIT: It would help make this tons more official and worth it if we actually got a mod of this subreddit behind the idea or something... To make the theme/conditions post and winners post for each month and maybe get some info in the sidebar or something. This idea will die quickly without moderator support.

------------------------------------

My name is Steven O'Brien and I'm a composer of contemporary classical music, so I'm hoping that a little exposure will help to sell a few albums or attract a few donations).

My music is freshly written, or wish to use tracks of differing moods but still retain a certain stylistic cohesiveness, you should definitely check out my portfolio. I release all of my music under a Creative Commons license.

Tracks are downloadable in a high quality




**Here are the tracks I recommend the most:**


[A set of twenty four preludes](http://soundcloud.com/stevenobrien/sets/twenty-four-preludes-op-2/), most of these resemble still images captured in audio, so they would be perfect for scenes that require a certain sense of reflection. Their moods range from the child-like simplicity and calmness of Nos. 1, 11, 19, 21 and 23, to the doubt filled anxieties of Nos. 2, 7, 14, 7

[Romances

Piano Sonatas Nos. [1](http://soundcloud.com/stevenobrien/sets/piano-sonata-no-1-in-f-minor/), with the tracks ranging from lengths of 2:30 to 9:00. They contain a similarly wide palette of emotions compared to the Twenty Four Preludes, but with a much more dramatically driven and structured tone.





If you require WAVs, need advice regarding the use of certain tracks, feel free to contact me at steven@steven-obrien.net, I'll be happy to assist you.


Also, I'd be absolutely delighted to hear from you.


I also offer services for writing original film music (with instrumentations including piano, choral etc.), please contact me at the above address if you are interested in this service.

1347805118.0,zyz33,Reddit Film Production Company [LA],DeepFriedDonkeyDick,109,24,94,"Hey guys!
        I was one of the attendee at the last Reddit Entertainment Mixer.  A great idea that went around at the end of the night was that we sign up for an email list with our specialties in hopes of gathering together to put our talents together and form a Reddit Film Production crew. 

I am definitely all for it!  To my recollection, I am not trying to step on anyone's toes or accuse anyone of anything.  I am merely stepping up and saying that I want something to happen and I am serious about putting my talents to use with the other amazingly talented and driven people of our niche group.  I definitely met some awesome characters that night and overheard many great stories.

I am serious about this.  I am willing to put all of my free time and talents on the line to see this thing through!  I can edit/act/write/direct and I will use everything at my disposal to help build this group up. 

 I would much rather prefer to work with Redditors because that sense of humor and understanding is shared more so commonly us and we could very easily create new content in brainstorming sessions. 

My vision for all of this is to not settle for some small time production.  I believe that we could build up to having a legit run business that can stand on its own!  Some of you have great connections to the entertainment industry that could help us produce, buy creating content and uploading it to our youtube channel and build a fan base, while also taking scripts and pilots to agents/producers/execs to help give us an edge to get our foot in.

To put this straight out, and I know a lot of you do too. Judging my some of the posts and comments, we are in no short supply of wit and humor and insightful thoughts.  All I have right now are my talents, ideas, and time, and drive.  And I am looking for those few that are willing to put in their passion as well and see this through. It does take WORK, but no one says we can't make it fun as well.

I also know we need to come together as a group, and I am all for that! 

I have NO clue yet as to where this meet up will take place or when.  I just wanted to throw this out here to see how many of you are serious enough to make this happen! Then we can proceed and schedule a fun meet and greet, but we need lots more content and ideas to see where we can take this.

So to end my rant, actors, camera men, singers, comedians, producers, directors, and Jewish people.  The whole gambit!

Please let me know of any thoughts/concerns/late night drive by t-bagging stories and let’s make this happen!

I will also be submitting this same post and link to this meetup to several of Reddit's entertainment subreddits to see the responses.

Thank you all! Cheers

I thought I'd take the time to give you all a little insight to what kind of opportunity is here.  

My Personal little story: After working on TV and commercials in Florida I picked up and moved to Louisiana for a possible opportunity to work on a feature film. I didn't know a soul. I cold called production offices from production reports and eventually landed a day playing position in the production office of a big budget show. After a couple of days working in the office I asked if a couple of the other Office PA's wanted to go for drinks

What you need to know:

There's a lot that I could tell you but all in all, locking in another 5 years of booming film industry. Because of this, Fox is now considering to put a permanent hub for production in Louisiana. 

[Check out one of our PSA's to keep the industry alive](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3Q9Bi_h8BA)

New Orleans and Baton Rouge are the 2 main hubs.  New Orleans has a lot more productions working there but Baton Rouge brings in the massive ones such as Oblivion, and the recently signed, upcoming Fantastic 4 Reboot. Baton Rouge has Celtic which is owned by Raleigh Studios containing 5 large warehouses/sound stages complete with buildings serving as production offices.  New Orleans has more resources considering most rental companies such as Hollywood Trucks, VER, Panavision and more are based out of New Orleans. New Orleans is also a whole lot more enticing for producers and actors. 

* Shows recently filmed/Shows in Production/Slated to film in Louisiana:

Left Behind, Dawn of the Planet of the Apes, Focus, Bonnie and Clyde, Untitled James Wan Thriller, Selfless, 22 Jump Street, Jurassic Park 4, Sons of Guns, The Butler

* Shows that were filmed in Louisiana:

Oblivions, Now You See Me, The Campaign, The East, Beautiful Creatures, The Host, Twilight, Battle: Los Angeles, The Road, Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter




So there's a little picture of what kind of shows are here and have been here. Those are mostly just off the top of my head from having worked here


There's plenty of opportunity out here you guys! Come join us!

Let me just start off by saying that these gigs (particularly the ones asking for free help) are the kind of shows/gigs you don't want to be working for; at least shows that meet the industry standard that is. No decent show with a real budget and a real production manager overseeing it with all appropriate departments involved are not going to even dare look into the depths of craigslist for hiring. They are going to hire the people they know or go through legitimate production sites. If they are having to lure you in with ""WORK IN HOLLYWOOD"" or with words like ""amazing, reputable, highly competitive"" then I can guarantee you they are none of those things. 


Having worked on shows where I'm hiring office PA's or collecting resumes for the AD's when they get into town I can tell you where I've gone to and have pulled from. There have also been times where in the middle of the show a department will need a PA to help them wrap out or assist for a couple weeks (editorial, I turn to these resources. 

1) Facebook groups dedicated to the local film industry. These are EXTREMELY helpful in gathering people. There are always others posting about new shows coming to town or asking for Day Players ASAP. Starting out I landed a day playing job on a Discovery reality show and ended up being hired full time. 

2) Local Film Commission directories

3) I personally haven't used these to hire but I've gotten calls from other production companies using the following sites. Calls from ESPN

Craigslist is helpful in many ways and I'm sure you'd be able to meet great people in the same position you are but (In my humble opinion) unless you're a student, you wouldn't reply to a craigslist post asking you to come help build their house for free right? all in the name of meeting other carpenters? No. I understand this is a different industry to compare others to but just be smart guys. There's other resources out there for you to use than just craigslist.

2. One harsh light. 

I want to put one of those warnings across every legitimate, or on the 5D your mom bought you.

In an attempt to impress with their ""style"", people would get out of the glare - is only part of the problem. 

Mind you


2A. If you are doing an alleyway scene, I can say ""oh, he put the (fill in large light) there,"" it doesn't work. I should not be aware of movie lights.


3. DO show me how you handle natural light.

Anyone who has seen a John Ford movie understands that working with natural light can be impressive. The DP reels I liked all showed something impressive with exteriors. I'm fine if they augmented natural light - but make it look good.

Digital does this well

Hey, because I'm assuming you are only putting your best out there.


I absolutely believe there are more good DPs out there today than ever. Sadly, unless I keep going back to the same people I know, which isnt really fair to directors who are looking for a wide range of choices.

I hope this gives aspiring DPs something to think about - and I look forward to what things other directors, there is a little of that, but, hey, I've had to look at a lot of stuff) I'd like to see the Reddit filmmakers community turn it into a place for good, honest, feedback.

* There is no pay involved
* It's not a lengthy job, at the logistics behind making a film with no budget and limited time.
* This is the Director/Writer's first ever time in making a film. So when I saw the publication in the newspaper that he's managed to get quite a big area closed off for filming, or just the PA with a few more responsibilities/duties.

I get that this could be due to the pieces shown being amateurish or not wanting to hurt the feelings of the people posting. Right now

So, and even some submissions to /r/bestof. I feel like there are a lot of young users here that are thirsty for info.

So, this will be a series of posts. I'll tackle whatever I feel needs to be explored. Feel free to suggest stuff as well. I hope everyone enjoys and (most importantly) is able to learn from this. The best thing that this subreddit offers is the opportunity for many different types of filmmakers to come together and share their knowledge in order to help everyone grow. 

As with most of these posts

*Now on to the subject.*

**Budgets**

I think that one of the biggest questions that is often raised is “how to fund my film?” I see countless crowd-sourcing campaigns (A subject that I will tackle in detail in a future post) that really don't understand how to fund an indie film. Filmmakers often expect a lot from these campaigns. In some cases

The thing I will push in this post most is the need to have a balanced budget. You need to have something that will allow you to achieve your artistic vision while still being able to fund the film. 

In order to successfully fund your film

Having a good budget can also help production go a bit smoother. Actually laying out a budget can help you see exactly what expenses are unnecessary. The first thing to cut out of a budget should be extra rental costs. This can be eliminated by scheduling better. The less shooting dates

Being ill-prepared can endanger a production. For example

I thought “Easy enough.” I was really excited to get to cover a subject like this on such a great scale for my first real documentary film. Pre-production was rushed and I had to come up with a plan quick. I had just received my refund from my private bank loan that was used to cover tuition. It was around 600 bucks and I thought that it would be more than enough to get the production finished. 

The event was taking place in Caesar's Palace in Atlantic City and would be running extremely late. I figured that it would be best to get a hotel room in Caesar's Palace so that we could be right in the center of everything. We could go to bed late and get up early without having to worry about transportation. So I booked a room. 1 night at Caesar's palace for a room with 2 beds was nearly $400. I figured that a crew of 5 would be able to fit into the room and I booked it. 

I immediately had to spend $30 on HDV tapes for the shoot. As for transportation to the event, but it had to be around 10 bucks to get there. None of us really carried cash so we had to scramble to find money for the various tolls. 

When we got there, I would have realized that a McDonald's was right around the corner.) So the remaining $100 went to feeding the crew. We were barley able to scrape together the cash for the tolls to come back to Philly. 

The stress of money put a lot of pressure on me. I went in blind

If I had taken the time to sit down and write out a good budget

So how do you write a good budget? For reference

First, it usually is reliant on how much coverage you want and also the schedule of your subjects. Next, take some time and jot down every expense you can think of. Come up with the big ones first, and move on to some of the more unexpected costs. Don't worry about the numbers yet. Simply write down everything you may need. Even if you already have the specific equipment, write these things down. Anything you may need for production should be listed. Here are my usual things: Crew and cast payment, equipment and props, food, lodging.

I then go through and find the prices for everything I listed. Crew is usually a bit difficult

Equipment is easier to find numbers for, however, I find it easier to just come up with a quick number. 

Now that you have all of these numbers

It's most likely a pretty high number. For example, it's pretty staggering. However, you have a good estimate of the cost. 

Now, equipment, props, locations, etc. Anything you can. Work really hard at this. The reason for marking everything is simple. It looks really good to say that I managed to get 10k worth of this stuff for free. Grants typically want you to have around 70% of your budget to be from in-kind donations. This shows that you have taken the effort to get as much as you can. It shows effort and passion. 

This also has a pretty strong psychological effect. You see how hard you've already worked. It's empowering to see the effort put in to your film. 

As for tools

But after all this work

Now

Please, don't be afraid to post them. I'd love to help out and hear from everyone. As I said, I really want to help out the community and see filmmakers grow as artists. However, this is the first post. I would really like to hear opinions on how easy this was to read and if it was helpful.

I've been working as a composer in LA for the past three years.  I'm not at the top of the game by any means but I have been working on a lot of projects with both well seasoned directors &amp; fresh out of school directors.  It seems to me that even the best schools in the country (USC

**Step 1 - deciding on your music.**

There are a lot of options.  licensed music from bands, The Black Eyed Peas, Aviici, and the like but in reality you can't afford this.  Seriously, unless Trent Reznor is your cousin you should really not even put the social network soundtrack against your picture even as a joke.  because you'll love it and then you'll be all ""let's just leave it in for now.""  terrible idea.  It will only end in tears.  If you're going to license music go find it on soundcloud and *contact the artist before you temp their music to picture.*  This way you don't end up working with a prima donna who wants thousands because they're awesome like that.  Have a contract at the ready, and get them to sign it as soon as they agree to let you have their music for no money.  

Library music is generally OK and you can sift through piles of crap to find something that works.  Then you pay a modest fee (anywhere from $20 - tens of thousands depending on your project and the library you're negotiating with) and you get the rights to use that music in your film.  

A composer will write music to picture and is the best thing for any film

You need to decide early on how you want to handle music and prepare accordingly.  If you're going to use bands get contracts ready.  If you're going to use library do your research and budget appropriately.  If you're going to use a composer find them as early in the process as you can.  There is NOTHING more frustrating than finding out that a director has ""no money left"" for the music but spent a couple grand on sandwiches for the crew on set.  If you hire them earlier you'll budget for their fee.  Please budget for their fee. 

**Step 2 - Temping your film.**

If you temp your film before sending it to your composer you should temp it with the most god awful crap you can find that still carries the emotional quality that you're looking for.  Trust me on this.  If you temp with the Social Network soundtrack or the Inception soundtrack and then hand it to your young composer YOU WILL HATE WHAT THEY GIVE YOU.  Why?  because you temped your picture with Oscar winning music that was recorded and mixed and mastered professionally and if your composer could write like that already then they sure as shit wouldn't be working on your ""indie short.""  You want to give them something that they're going to be better than.  Something that you're going to be glad to get rid of.  Tell your composer what about that crappy temp you think works (the rhythm, the synth idea, the ""darkness"")

Before you send your composer ask them what they want in the video.  SMPTE timecode?  two pop?  I prefer dialog &amp; SFX to be panned hard left and temp music to be panned hard right so that I can split them out.  Make sure that you put a card before the 2 pop that says ""[film title],[audio sample rate]""  (ex. ""Short Film, Jim Dandy composer cut, 24 FPS, 48k audio"")  Trust me, this is SUPER important information and if anything doesn't get delivered to you in proper format you can point to that card and say ""dude, you got this all in the video I sent you.""

**step 3 - Notes.**

So you just got version 1 of the music back and WOW did mr. composer man (or woman) miss the boat.  First

But after living with it and mulling it over you're sure that there's a lot that's not working.  If you can

Never, say something like ""your cue needs a little more..."" because then they feel like you're actually listening to the music and talking about what they did, not someone else's work.  Think how it would feel if someone said to you ""you know, what Spielberg does really well is...""  You'd be like, ""Why are you comparing me to him!?  That's insane!""

Talk in emotional terms.  Use emotion words.  Don't try and talk music.  Odds are you're going to use a term wrong and confuse your composer.  Unless you have some kind of degree in music avoid musical terms.  Speak to your composer like you would to your actors.  Emotions

**Step 4 - Revisions**

Try to limit yourself to two revisions, of course, assuming that you're not asking for rock and getting jazz.  If they're sucking a giant nut then get a new composer.  If they're revising and revising and giving you what you ask for and you're still not happy try and find out where the communication is breaking down.

**step 5 - delivery**

Spell out to them what you want as a deliverable.  Do you want one long stereo audio file (for anything 15 minutes or less do this.  It's easier on you.)  Do you want stems? (unless you've got a really professional dub engineer don't ask for stems)  Tell them specifically file format, 24 bit 48k.)  If they are using ProTools then audio will spot directly to timecode in your avid session.  BUT just to be sure you should ask them to title each audio file with the SMPTE code that it starts on.  (example ""1m02_title_01111513.wav"")  This way your mixing engineer can spot the audio to the correct TC or check it if it spots automatically.  

**Step 6 - Credit**

Always ask as early as possible how your composer wants to be credited.  Make sure to ask if they have any ""additional music by..."" credits or musicians to credit.  Since the vast majority of you are small indie types you should tell your composer to create and submit their own cue sheets.  But if you're amazingly awesome you will get a cue sheet from them and submit it to ASCAP and BMI for them.  This is so that if your film gets any play on TV or in theaters or whatever then your composer will get some performance royalties.  If they're not registered with ASCAP or BMI ask them why they don't like money.  Then tell them to get their shit together and register.  

**Step 7 - Ask me questions**

Feel free to shoot me a message with specific questions on dealing with composers or music for film in general if you want more specifics.  

I'm sure I've skipped over a lot.  I didn't even cover publishing.  If other composers want to fill in or correct any of the above please do.  Being that this is Reddit and I've put up a bunch of opinions I'm sure that there will be plenty of posts contradicting a lot of what I've put up here or calling me a jerk or something.  Just keep in mind that this is all advice coming from my time working with people who are at the same level as many of you.

Being taken “seriously” by the film community doesn’t mean you have to hit the audience in the face with a sledgehammer saying

Sorry, production design, music, etc. If you don’t have the resources to back up your “serious” story it can fall apart easily. With comedy all those issues can go out the window. You just require good writing, comedic timing, and smart directing. Also, the most incredible phenomenon happens when you show a comedy: the audience will let you know what they really think by laughing. A drama, “your film was good.” You don’t know what their real reaction is.	

I guess what I am trying to say is that if you are in film school still you should have fun with your  thesis film. You are presenting yourself to the world. Don’t take yourself so seriously so early by trying to tackle the world. You will have your whole filmmaking life to build up on that. Make a simple story that you would want to watch over and over again

Write from the heart and most importantly (and a big fucking cliché) write what you know. But honestly

Short films are a calling card. If you want to work in Hollywood then it literally is your business card. Hollywood is a business –the entertainment business. You are making these films to entertain and capture the audience's interest. 

Do that and anyone will take you seriously

Here's what I'd love to see:

* How long your video is. It may weed out and kill a lot of reviews of your content

* I want to know specifics for what you're seeking critique on. Is it the narrative? Do you not know how your talent performs? Is it technical. You don't have to write an essay

* Don't just beg for critique in the title and link to youtube. Make a text post, but it placates my ego as well (yeah, it's a truth) and makes me feel like you really want me to sit and write something.

* If you have bad audio, but I'm putting that out there, I'm only really going to look at things that meet a certain criteria that's already in my mind.

* If you're argumentative or overly defensive in the comments

* Conversely if you're engaging in good conversation

* Don't spam me with 10 of your videos. Be thoughtful of the entire subreddit and try to choose your content with care.

1362239869.0,19ixpp,Hi r/filmmakers! I just finished scoring a short film - here are some tips for you when you're working with or trying to find a composer for your project.,musicformedia,63,11,12,"Looking for a composer:

* **Ask to see demos of their previous work** - both visual and audio. A composer could have great Soundcloud demos
* **You don't always need an incredibly flexible composer** - just a composer that is great in the genre you need. If you want a simple piano score (a la Philip Glass for example), I'm great at action/drama/comedy/sci-fi genres, but would fail at an epic level if I tried to score a Bollywood movie.
* **Try to find someone who is recommended to you**. There is no better reference than word of mouth - someone who has worked with a composer already will know the quality of their work so if you know someone who has worked with a composer
* **Google search and check the IMDB credits of any potential composers**. Sometimes you might find other filmmakers have written a review of the composer you are looking at hiring and this can be useful (for example, IMDB credits can sometimes validify a composers' level of experience.
* **Start your search early!**. Typically you should start looking for a composer once you start post-production
* **Beware the free!**. Often times when you post your project on a forum, by not paying a composer anything, it gives them little encouragement to write the best music they can write and often they might not even finish the music if something else comes up - leaving you up poop creek without a paddle!
* **Set aside your budget from the outset - and don't skimp on it**. A composer has to write, record, edit, produce, mix and master the music - bare this in mind when setting aside your budget. Whereas some parts of your production will have one person doing that one single job, a composer has to fulfill every single job that is required for creating the music. It can be a hugely time consuming and stressful job (but I love it!). Also, don't forget when you are putting together your budget that if you want live players rather than midi/sampled music
* **Know what you're looking for**. Do you want exclusive music for your project (written exclusively for you and cannot be used anywhere else again)

Working with a composer:

* **Learn a couple of musical terms so you can get your ideas across more easily**. For example ""crescendo"" (a gradual increase in volume)
* **Speak in emotions**. As the music needs to enhance the on screen emotions
* **A temp track can help**. A [Temp track](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temp_track) can be a good guideline for the type of music you want for a scene. Often directors use classical music for certain types of scenes or other film music they like to show a composer the style or instrumentation they are going for. As a composer
* **Understand the process a composer will be going through**. [The Film Scoring Process](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_score#Process_of_creation) is basically as follows: spotting (finding where in your film needs music), then recording (either using live players or using software). If you want to drastically change the music in a scene, know that the composer will need to go through this process again from scratch - which is fine, but can't be done right away.
* **Treat early ""draft"" cues as what they are - just drafts**. When I work with a director
* **Listen without the music, sometimes the music can actually force the emotions of a scene to an extent where the music becomes very obvious. In order to make sure this doesn't happen, watch the scene without the music, and then again with the music and ask yourself - does the music enhance what's happening on screen or take away from it? 
* **Try to respond with feedback as quickly as possible**. If a composer sends you over a cue or asks a question

Hopefully that list helps you a little bit. A great film score can make a movie - just as a bad one can break it - so never underestimate how valuable a good composer is to your project :)

I'd love to hear your thoughts on the above list

Seems like the major consensus has thus far been: don't skimp on good audio

My opinion:

1. Static shots.  Not every shot has to be on a dolly or steadicam

2.  Focusing.  Don't go crazy racking focusing between the main subject and everything else in frame.  What the lens is focused on is meant to signal to the audience what to pay attention to

3.  Get your colors

4.  Avoid filters &amp; effects in post to give your movie the ""film look"" - 99.9% of the time it's going to look obvious and tacky.

5.  Avoid gun shots and explosion VFX unless you're really good at it.

6.  Don't crop your footage to a more ""cinematic"" aspect ratio unless you shot for it.  ",self,t5_2r1ip,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/Filmmakers/comments/160qwh/techniques_cameraediting_for_less_amateur_looking/

1367702812.0,1dp5lt,10 Things I learned from Shooting My First Horror Feature,zeltrine,61,10,27,"I was hired to write and direct a horror feature film in Naples

1. Murhpy's Finger

Murphy's Law is that if anything can go wrong, we got it: flat tires, lost audio files, an actor almost dying (he's fine), firing actors, equipment getting lost, equipment getting fried, crazy people harassing us

2. It Will Be Over Soon

On the first day, and then second thing is to take each problem one at a time. If worse comes to worse and you're still freaking out, just tell yourself ""It will be over soon.""

3. Batman Belt

I never thought that these items would come in super handy a few times every day but I'll never go into a film shoot without them: Flashlight, so the flashlight was always handy. Many times we were dealing with things that could give us splinters, and the weather was crazy cold when we were there so the gloves saved my fingers more than once. The multitool saved my ass many times: locks that got stuck were fixed, screws the needed tightening, and things that needed to be cut.

4. Puppies

On the shoot, do you get mad at it? It's just the way puppies are, no need to get angry or annoyed by them. As long as they're not bothering you, or interfering with your work, you just have to deal with it or ignore it.

Point is that you have to accept people as they are and the way they behave - you're not going to change them.

5. Worst Superpower

The worse superpower you have is the power of assumption. DO NOT ASSUME ANYTHING. Consider yourself ignorant of all things and make sure with 100% certainty that you are sure of something. I ASSUMED that the clothing sponsor we had would email us when they needed our information, but we left the house without anyone taking it. On one of the final days, I told an actress that she was going to be in the water, but she ASSUMED that she was just going to be walking through the water, and I ASSUMED that she understood that her ass was going to be laying down in the cold ass water. We both ASSUMED that the other knew what we were talking about. All of these examples are communication problems, but it stems from ASSUMPTIONS.

6. WATER TIGHT PROCEDURES

Make sure you have a water tight system for collecting, and cleansing memory cards. Once you're settled on the process, DO NOT CHANGE IT. I lost audio for a whole scene because I decided to change my procedure of copying audio folders. I decided to change from coping all of the audio folders to just copying one folder, and apparently, something happened where the audio files for the scene were in another folder that I did not copy. We also lost 4 shots because I they were shot on a card that I thought was already dumped, the AC forgot to mark it with a green sticker, meaning that it had new footage instead of just old footage.

7. Your Dialogue Sucks

There are two reasons why your dialogue may suck: First reason, if your dialogue sounds believable, then the second reason that it may still suck is that the actors get the subtext wrong. What do I mean? No, it's not because the actors suck, its that they get the subtext wrong and you have to explain it to them.

Context and subtext go hand in hand. In a scene where two people that have hated each other at first and fell in love later,"" the subtext is ""I love you.""  If the actor says it wrong, it's because she didn't get the subtext. It's your job to fix it.

8. Look at the monitor

There were many times where I couldn't stand behind the DP to look at the monitor while we were shooting. We couldn't afford to have an extra monitor without sacrificing the budget in another areas, where as the monitor is focused on just your actor(s).

My point is do whatever you have to do to get an extra monitor that you can look through at all times.

9. Open Flow of Ideas

The whole point of making a feature film is to make the best film possible with the time, rank and hierarchy may get in the way of the flow of good ideas. Some people may be weary or afraid of giving their input because they're worried that they may be ""stepping out of their bounds."" I don't believe in such a thing - if you have a good idea, you have a good idea and it should be heard. Speak to every cast and crew member individually and tell them that if they have any ideas, to come to you privately to discuss them. There were many times where the actors or a crew member came up to me AFTER a scene was done and they had a good idea but now the opportunity was wasted, so breed a set that has an open flow of Ideas.

Why should extra ideas be talked privately instead of openly? Because you may have to reject it - not every idea is a good idea. Some people get butthurt that their idea was not thought of as being good so they will try to defend it publicly

10. Dark side

If you're making a film shoot that's either 30 days or even 3 days, and it's bad enough that you're under-manned, under-financed, and then you have to deal with an asshole or a diva.  If you know you're going to work with someone that has a dark side for 10 days and longer, then at least you have the advantage of knowing their full character before hand.

Point is make sure to know someone well enough before you agree to work with them for a long ass time.

* Do an “all or nothing” campaign. There is still a stigma to the idea that “filmmakers can keep the money even if they don't hit their goal”. I know too many people who refuse to donate to campaigns like that because

* Your pitch video should demonstrate a strong command of your filmmaking ability. Inspire confidence. Show them you can make a movie that looks like a movie. That means putting the same effort into it that you would into the making of the movie. You are a filmmaker, bad lighting, noisy footage, etc. If you and your team are sitting down to record your pitch video and you or someone on your team says “the mic on the camera will be good enough”… you are not ready.

* Don’t waste your time spamming people you don’t know. Focus on your core audience, co-workers, colleagues, etc. When someone donates, thank them publicly on their facebook profile and INCLUDE THE LINK TO YOUR CAMPAIGN. They will likely respond with a comment saying why they donated: “I believe in you” or “it’s looks awesome!”. Now you have a public testimonial that all THEIR friends can see. This is how we were able to run our campaign without randomly spamming facebook and twitter.

* If you fail to find support
This is the thing I stressed over for weeks before we launched: What am I offering people who back us? Perks? Blah. Who really wants a poster of a movie that doesn’t even exist yet? No one. Think about what has inspired you to donate to someone’s campaign (and if you haven’t, it’s because the filmmaker shared something personal that I could relate to. I think, “I like what this person is doing, where their head is at, I want to help.” Then I click the donate button. I’ve never said “okay, their pitch video was too long, it was edited weird, but damn it I love horror comedies! I’m donating!!!”

* Be prepared to be at it every day. During our campaign

* Build your team out of people who run in different social circles. You will need help

* Do a short campaign. Kickstarter’s statistics show little benefit to running a campaign longer than 30 days. 30 days is the sweet spot. Use it to your advantage to create a sense of urgency. And use milestones and minigoals. It’s easier to motivate people to help you reach 25% funded by this Friday

* At every step, would you give them $25? $100? doubtful. When people send you facebook invites to ‘like’ something, do you ignore them? I do. So why would I expect others to react differently to my requests? Look to your own behavior. What moves you to take action? How many times must you hear about something before you check it out? Who in your social media circles is recommending the random youtube videos you watch each day and why do you trust their “recommendation”? Is it because you share interests? Or because you admire them? I am not a salesman. It’s not in my nature. But I’ve found a lot of answers by looking at my own habits and behavior online.

* Last one. Talking AT people is not as effective as talk WITH them. I was able to keep a dialogue going about the project on twitter and facebook by releasing more videos about the project, producing quality, engaging content is what we’re good at. So use it.

* Okay, support THEIR projects, write blog posts, comment on theirs, give give give, be a decent human being and participate in the indie film community and you will be rewarded. Because these are the people who will support you in kind when you launch your crowdfunding campaign. This is your social media army who will be tweeting on your behalf and spreading the word.

1347213470.0,zlza2,Beyond 3 point lighting,w3y,44,2,10,"There was a recent thread where the OP learned there was more than a basic 3 point lighting set up. So I figured

There are generally 5 lighting ""areas"":

* Key
* Fill
* Back aka Hair
* Background
* Eye aka Catch Light

**Key**

The key is your primary source of light. In traditional 3 point lighting, raised and tilted down 45\*.

But the key can really come from anywhere

When you move the key

**Fill**

The fill is what controls your contrast ratio. A lot of times, but control how dramatic it is. The more your fill approaches your key, the less dramatic it will be.

The fill is also used to control wrap. Depending on where it's placed

**Back aka Hair**

This light lights up the subjects hair or back. It's used to help separate the subject from the background. Especially helpful when your subject has black hair on a dark background.

If the light is offset to 45* at eye level

**Background**

The background light exposes anything in the background you woud like to see. But it's also used to create contrast in the rest of your frame.

**Eye aka Catch Light**

The eye light is the little sparkle in your subject's eye. Often times, they don't always have it, so you have to set it up.

[Jacoolh adds: ""...the eye light

**Lighting Setups**

In general, 3) Top, 4) Front, 5) Back and 6) Under.

**Three-quarters**

This is your traditional lighting setup where your key is at 45\* to the subject

**Side**

The key is brought down to eye level and put directly to one side of the subject. This creates a strong distinction between one side of the subject and the other.

Often times, so you will probably need to give your subject one.

**Top**

The key is placed above and in front of the subject. You ses this a lot in more traditional glamour photography. It fills in a lot of the shadows in the eyes, can fill in a lot of wrinkles.

**Back**

Sometimes

**Under**

Similar to ""Toppy"" light

**Beyond**

That's just a basic run down to help you start thinking beyond three point lighting. Each of the setups can be used with any variation of fill to create different moods and looks. The important thing is to know what you're trying to do and what you like. Make choices

Hope this helped!
