###FAQ

**Q**: When will Starbound be released?  
&gt;**A**: There are no release dates yet (ignore all the rumors!). Any date set is purely speculation since the game is still being developed. Some Starbounders have a habit of estimating when it will come out

**Q**: Is there a beta out?  
&gt;**A**: Not yet, but there hasn't been a date set yet.  

[More Info](http://www.reddit.com/r/starbound/comments/16i7se/preorder_beta_confirmed/)

**Q**: How can I support the game?  
&gt;**A**: There is currently no way to pre-order or crowd-fund the game. There are also no options to donate directly to the developers. *However*

[More info](http://playstarbound.com/support-starbound-development-with-wanderlust-rebirth/)

*""A percentage of Wanderlust sales will go straight to Chucklefish and support Starbound development.""* - Tiy

**Q**: Will the game be on Steam?  
&gt;**A**: It's been confirmed that they are aiming to release the game on Steam, Linux and [Ouya](https://twitter.com/Tiyuri/status/281401347855749121). There has been no information on console releases as of yet.

1364980134.0,1bkta7,Starbound Roadmap: Text Edition,Herdo,123,10,26,"**I also have this [posted to the forums](http://community.playstarbound.com/index.php?threads/starbound-roadmap-text-edition.16698/)

I've decided to catalog the information on the Roadmap in a text version.  The main reason for doing this is to keep a log of the completion of each section, so my thinking is that some things may go unnoticed.  Having it in a text form will allow us to compare the two and see if anything has been updated.

I plan to have the current Roadmap posted in the main body here


**UNIVERSE GENERATION**


* **Universe / sector generation 90%**

The Universe is divided into sectors, planet generation and orbiter generation systems are complete. We may add more features to this, however, as well as the ability to insert hard-coded systems and special areas as we progress.  [Image](http://playstarbound.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/sector.png)

* **Biome Content 90%**

A large number of biomes are present and content complete. There is always room to add additional trees, and completely new biomes. We’ll be constantly adding these post release.

* **Mini Biomes 60%**

We have a number of mini biomes per larger biome

* **World-level parameter gen 70%**

The world generation code is capable of choosing biomes, liquids, weather, ore distribution, underground layers, cave structure and more. However these elements need to be tied to the planet’s level to create an overall difficulty.

* **Star / Planet orbital rendering 80%**

Planet art is generated to appear beneath the players ship when the player is in orbit. The planet art matches the biome present on the planet as well as the planet’s dominant liquid. The travel animation from planet to planet / solar system to solar system needs to be smoother. [Image](http://playstarbound.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/orbit.png)

* **World bookmarking

World storage is largely complete


**WORLD GENERATION**

* **Biome/Terrain Selection 90%**

Based on the distance to a star and what type of star it is

* **Terrain / Cave generation 90%**

Generators are completed for hills, canyons, chasms, islands and more. However at present each planet only makes use of one generator based on it’s selected biome. We would like multiple terrain generators to make up the planets surface. Cave gen is largely complete, some code is needed to ensure caves are present in rare underground biomes. [Image](http://playstarbound.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/worldgen21.png)

* **Liquid Placement 90%**

Liquid placement is complete

* **Large Dungeon Placement 90%**

Generates a very large, need to tweaks when and where to generate dungeons, because it is currently too predictable. Also need to force dungeon materials to be very difficult to remove compared to regular blocks. [Image](http://playstarbound.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/worldgen41.png)

* **Mini Terrain/Dungeon Placement 70%**

These are small block/object patterns that are used to add predefined features to the terrain. For example a fallen log creating a bridge across a lake could be produced this way and the engine would find suitable places along the terrain to have it appear. 


This feature is code complete and lots of these templates already exist but we would like to add more

* **Plants/Object/Chest Placement 90%**

The engine is capable of spawning any defined object or plant in a defined distribution around a biome. This is more or less code complete

* **Plant Growing 60%**

Crops

* **Parallax &amp; Colour Processing 90%**

Parrallax and colour shifting is complete

* **Weather / Time / Temperature 90%**

Largely complete, wind, thunderstorms, sunshine and more already exist in the game and the player temperature mechanic is complete, though the stats may need tweaking to provide the correct level of challenge. Day/Night cycles are complete and their length based on the planets position around it’s sun. As well as light they also have an effect on temperature and mob spawns. [Image1](http://playstarbound.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/worldgen91.png) [Image2](http://playstarbound.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/worldgen92.png) [Image3](http://playstarbound.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/worldgen93.png)

**CREATURE GENERATION** 

* **Quadrupeds 70%**

The game can produce a huge range of quadruped npcs, size and art. [Image](http://playstarbound.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/quad.png)

* **Bipeds 70%**

The game can produce a huge range of biped npcs, size and art. [Image](http://playstarbound.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/biped.png)

* **Fish 50%**

The generator for fish NPCs and all of it’s art has been configured but fish do not yet appear in game. [Image](http://playstarbound.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/fish.png)

* **Flying 50%**

The generator for flying NPCs and all of it’s art has been configured but they do not yet appear in game. [Image](http://playstarbound.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/flying.png)

* **Humanoids 20%**

Humanoid npcs include villagers and dungeon guardians. The ground work has been laid to get these into the game dynamically. [Image](http://playstarbound.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/dungeon13.png)

* **Pregenerated NPCs 50%**

A number of pregenerated NPCs appear in the game and we’d like to add a handful of unique npcs per dungeon/village. 

* **Behaviour Scripts 50%**

A number of NPC behaviour scripts are complete and more are being added

* **Enemy Projectiles 60%**

Ranged enemies can be set to shoot any projectile

**DUNGEONS AND VILLAGES**

* **Dungeon/Village generation 80%**

Dungeon generation is complete, often more. Of these the majority are in the game, with others already designed and graphically complete, awaiting layouts. [Image1](http://playstarbound.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/dungeon12.png) [Image2](http://playstarbound.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/dungeon13.png) [Image3](http://playstarbound.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/dungeons11.png)

* **Dungeon protection 20%**

Players will be unable to break dungeon objects/blocks until they destroy an item that protects the dungeon. This item needs to be implemented. [Image](http://playstarbound.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/dungeon21.png)

**QUESTS AND MISSIONS**

* **Interact with NPCs 20%**

NPC interaction is largely limited to combat at present. Quest generation is one of our next big goals with development. The quest and shop UI has been designed and is ready to be placed in the game. Friendly NPCs will protect their property and will speak differently to players of different races. 

* **Quest management UI 40%**

The quest management UI has been designed and mocked up

""&lt;Tiyuri&gt; it also makes things very hard to stream also

&lt;Tiyuri&gt; A good example of that is npcs

&lt;Tiyuri&gt; npcs have a behaviour system

&lt;Tiyuri&gt; and then it mixes and matches them

&lt;Tiyuri&gt; to get a unique npc

&lt;Tiyuri&gt; but of course

&lt;Tiyuri&gt; needs to be tested

&lt;Tiyuri&gt; and testing a new behaviour when there are tons of possible combinations is.. well.. not doable

&lt;Tiyuri&gt; honestly

&lt;Tiyuri&gt; so what we do is disable everything

&lt;Tiyuri&gt; and enable one behaviour at a time

&lt;Tiyuri&gt; but when i stream

&lt;Tiyuri&gt; people (reasonably) assume

&lt;Tiyuri&gt; that npcs only have one behaviour

&lt;Tiyuri&gt; and are dumb and boring""

&gt;well I will ask the most provocative question....why all the fluff? I know you guys are trying to make your game perfect

This was Tiy's response:

&gt;The ground work stuff is always being worked on. There's usually at least two programmers adding essential features at any one time. Given that they're major features however

&gt;We of course do also add things that aren't absolutely essential for the game to function. But calling them fluff understates their importance. A game with only the bare minimum of features is a game without a soul. The impression you get when you play the game for the first time can be driven just as much by small

&gt;Who decides what is and isn't required anyway?

&gt;We have an experience we want to deliver. The features we choose to add ARE essential to creating that experience. It's a question of tone

This pretty much sums up the reasons as-to why a beta isn't a likely event in the near future.

The thing that Tiy said in this post that really stuck out to me was

&gt;A game with only the bare minimum of features is a **game without a soul.**

Think of all the other games you've played. Think of all the game's you've enjoied. Did you enjoy them purly because the mechanics of the game functioned? Or did you enjoy them because the content within them gave the game it's own character?

Just something to think about.

&lt;@Tiyuri&gt; however

&lt;@Tiyuri&gt; the game is so far along

&lt;@Tiyuri&gt; theres no chance of it fizzling out

&lt;@Tiyuri&gt; we just put insane levels of detail into everything

&lt;@Tiyuri&gt; and i dont do videos on anything until that insane level of detail is realised


&lt;@Tiyuri&gt; to give another example of our attention to detail

&lt;@Tiyuri&gt; every single material in the game gives off its own footstep sounds when walked on

&lt;@Tiyuri&gt; or jumped on

&lt;@Tiyuri&gt; a largeeeee number of objects in the game make sounds

&lt;@Tiyuri&gt; when someone accesses a chest, it closes

&lt;@Tiyuri&gt; a lot of objects are interactive just for the sake of being interactive

&lt;@Tiyuri&gt; see a gong in an avian temple? you can go and bang it

&lt;@Tiyuri&gt; every block and every object has a description

&lt;@Tiyuri&gt; you can examine everything

&lt;@Tiyuri&gt; and whilst its very easy to say that these things aren't essential

&lt;@Tiyuri&gt; I disagree


&lt;Arpege&gt; Can you only beam to planets Tiyuri

&lt;Arpege&gt; Sort've like sky islands but in space :B

&lt;@Tiyuri&gt; by release youll be able to beam onto planets (done already), but actually very easy to do, just havent gotten around to it), and ships in flight (done already)

&lt;@Tiyuri&gt; and possibly some more

&lt;@Tiyuri&gt; also friends ships

&lt;@Tiyuri&gt; you can go there

&lt;WarStalkeR&gt; Tiyuri: you said ships in flight... Then it means possibly an space ship battles too?

&lt;@Tiyuri&gt; not for release

&lt;@Tiyuri&gt; but i have an idea on how space ship battles will work

&lt;@Tiyuri&gt; for post release


&lt;@Tiyuri&gt; I need to do a video of the building system

1367671580.0,1doc0s,Proposal: blueprints (wall of text and mockup implementation inside),jimeno,70,15,16,"Something I really missed in Terraria was the ability to save-export-import designs for buildings and support structures like obsidian generators and stuff. And my designs were really bad so in some cases i just copied stuff from terrariawiki's JPGs with the aid of the grid tool.

Given that SB is set in a more technological era

Blueprints for particular structures might be even be some kind of item drop, to call boss battles, etc.

**IMPLEMENTATION**

blueprints are just a text file and a slot occupying item in game. inside the file are coded the number of resource needed and their place in the project,0).

**FILE FORMAT:**

an example square made of gold wall blocks:

GoldWall(1):12 (let the game know it needs 12 gold wall blocks and assigns it number 1 in the grid identifier)

    1:line(0
    1:line(0
    1:line(0
    1:line(4
or just 1:rectangle(0,center_y,radius) and so on.

the blueprint can be used in game

**MORE ITEMS ASSOCIATED WITH BLUEPRINTS**

Engineering Book: Lets you collect all your blueprints in a single itemslot.

Engineering Camera: Lets you select an area and create a blueprint from that.

WorldNet Engineering Computer: lets you import-export from/to disk-internet the sharable blueprints (not the eventual ""quest"" blueprints). can be portable or something that must be placed to be used.

BuildBot Mark I: automatically builds any given blueprint. Must be fed the needed resources and a blueprint before starting

BuildBot Mark II: same as Mark I

BuildBot Mark III: the best buildbot
(the added resource use is just a drawback for the automatism)

Hyper galactic 3d printer: it just prints out the building at lighting fast speed

Greetings fellow Starbound comrades

I was a bit hesitant to post this for fear of it sounding like self promotion

Over the past two weeks I have been developing Starbound Codex

Now you may be thinking ""How can you make a Starbound reference app when the game isn't out yet?""  Well good sir and/or madam

Now

Some of the features I plan to add when Starbound beta testing begins:

* Crafting recipes/blueprints
* Item database
* Weapon/Tool database
* Monster type database? (depends on how generation works)

Of course this all depends on how the procedural generation works and how much the generated content can be generalized. Let me know if you have any feature suggestions!

Last note: I apologize for the ads

I hope you guys find this useful

Players could be more organized and dedicate chests with signs for certain items

If there was a different type of chest for each item type that would help organize but still would put the onus on the player to sort.

Perhaps the Ship's inventory could be an abstraction of every chest on every planet or something.

As much customization as there is to the character creator

Step 1:  


Hey developers: Is there any way you can offer up the technical details on how the hair/heads of the sprites work? I'd like to be able to have a Community submission project where we can submit a head matching certain criteria:  

* Does it meet technical specifications (color/size/transparencies/filetype/etc)
* Does it match the style of Starbound (developer approval
* Is it significantly different than options already provided in game
* Not copyright breaking or otherwise stupid/meme/reference
* Legal mumbo jumbo of all ownership belongs to Chucklefish/starbound upon submission  


Step 2:  

With the guidelines of resolution, etc, users would create heads and hairstyles for all races they'd want added to the game. Just host them on a large gallery for the developers to peruse and take what they want to add to the game.

Maybe if we are lucky Tiy or one of the other devs will read this and we can help influence their decision. Now obviously I really want to play the game as i'm sure all of you do

**CONs**

* A lot of people will no doubt fail to understand what a beta is no matter how many places it is explained and will rage at the incomplete nature of a beta product

* Releasing the beta now will cost chucklefish money in bandwidth with every updated version as people swarm to download it in huge quantities 

* It is possible reviewers will jump the gun and review the beta product

* Once released the forums would likely become a mass of feature/bug begging -thanks Kiofspa

**PROs**

* The Devs will receive a comprehensive list of all the bugs in the current version of the game

* The Devs will gain a ton of information on how the game works on a huge variety of systems

* There will be a large boost in sales

* Youtubers will provide a huge amount of free advertising for the game once they can start making starbound videos

* It will stop the constant begging for the Beta that I have no doubt the devs run into every time they turn around

* It will provide a ton of user feedback and ideas for how the game can be improved before it is fully released

1350171110.0,11fpoh,The random monster generator: how I think it works.,CornishCucumber,49,6,1,"NOTE: This is my own interpretation

Okay

There are two different types of monster, whereas the front legs are layered on top.) I believe there may also be several more layers (feet + hands), but I'm not entirely sure.

I also think two colours will be used, steel arms, wheels, teeth, eyes, etc). So these colours will be randomly generated using a little bit of code.

Here are a few examples I've made using previous posts:

[Image One](http://imgur.com/c8zVD.png)

[Image Three](http://imgur.com/kGwzF.png)  

[Image Four](http://imgur.com/G4vaQ.png)  

[Image Five](http://imgur.com/kcMtk.png)

Note: I also think that there will be categories of monsters, humanoid, so variations might be limited to avoid very strange monsters. I also think that each component (i.e head) will have a joint-node telling the program where to place the other limbs (i.e. to the body) otherwise you'll get some very broken looking monsters...",,False,self,t5_2tkp6,,http://www.reddit.com/r/starbound/comments/11fpoh/the_random_monster_generator_how_i_think_it_works/

I know that most would likely disagree, and forces you to interact with the community. 

Now Starbound seems to have an awesome community already, in order to complete the game( already though, as I said, this doesn't look to be the case :) ).

This may be covered elsewhere

TL;DR: Is multiplay required

## Starbound Text Roadmap
Summary|Section|Completion|Images
:---|:---|:---|:---
**Player Mechanics**|
The full set of player movements is complete, crouching and swimming. The keyboard and mouse is the default method of control and currently the only one implemented. Though gamepad support is a possibility in the future. Items and tech that alters player physics and movement is an ongoing task.|Player physics and movement|80%|[1](http://playstarbound.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/playermechanics11.png) [2](http://playstarbound.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/playermechanics12.png) [3](http://playstarbound.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/playermechanics13.png)
Status effects include poison, some work needs to be completed on their visual representation. e.g the player/npcs giving off flames whilst burning.|Status Effects|100%
Items and tools include anything a player can wield. A full and extensible item system is ready for use
Character creation is complete
**Core Mechanics**|
Collision is complete and has been tested as working as expected up to ridiculous speeds. Some minor bugs with lip jumping that need to be sorted out.|Physics / Collisions|100%|
Protocol is functional
Entities are tracked irrespective of their type. Their interface is unified to accept basic management commands. Moreover
Differences between base generated state and current state are stored in a custom coded B-Tree based database and serializes to a file.|Low level world/entity storage|90%|
**User Interface**|
The crafting interface is functional and powerful
Health
The inventory window is complete minus a couple of bugs that need to be smoothed out.|Inventory|90%|[1](http://playstarbound.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/inventory.png)
The party window has been designed and the graphics are available
The tech window has been designed and the graphics are available
The chat window is in and functional
Travel destinations are selected via a Starmap
Tooltips appear on every item
Investigation is complete (minus one bug fix).|Investigation|100%|
The log UI has been designed and is awaiting implementation. A large number of documents, etc have been produced to fill the log book.|Log|90%|[1](http://playstarbound.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/log1.png)
The hotbar is complete
**Server Stuff**|
Allows party formation, PVP, mission instances and more. Some of the base work on 'teams' is done, including teams for NPCs, allowing for NPCs to fight amongst themselves. However most of the work here is interface work that has yet to begin.|Party mechanics|20%|
Needed for effective moderating
Needed for rate limiting, for hitbox tampering and other client side hacks. Need to move some things to server for security’s sake.|Security / Anti Cheat|20%|
Everything an IRC server has. Multiple channels, group chatting, broadcast messages, identification and authentication by password and/or by user key, forced nick changing, klining, banning by IP or client fingerprint. User whitelists. User permissions in the form of Access Control Lists or IRC Flags.|Admin Tools|20%|
**Items**|
Melee weapons are fully generated, range, class and more are configured dynamically. Each melee weapon is given a generated graphic and name. We would like the way the weapon is used to differ per class a bit more and are currently adding additional mods, such as flaming weapons.|Melee weapon generation|80%|[1](http://playstarbound.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/melee.png)
Gun weapons are fully generated, energy consumption, level, and more are configured dynamically. Each gun is given a generated graphic and name. A good first set of projectile mods has been produced allowing the different classes of guns to shoot many different things.|Gun generation|90%|[1](http://playstarbound.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/gun.png)
A large number of projectiles have been produced and plugged into gun generation. Explosive weapons need to carry over their damage to their explosion and adding some additional options to projectile configuration will allow for an even wider array of projectiles to be produced.|Projectiles|70%|[1](http://playstarbound.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/projectile.png)
Block code is very much complete, their physics, transparency, value and so on. There is little to no code required to finish up blocks, only a few more materials need to be added, this will continue to be expanded post release.|Blocks|90%|[1](http://playstarbound.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/blocks.png)
Object code is very much complete
Consumable code is complete and a large number of consumables exist already, buffs/debuffs and so on.|Consumables|70%|
Armor code is largely complete
Vehicles items will beam down a vehicle from the players ship that alters the players physics and movement. Mechs and hoverbikes have already been designed and animated. Implementation on those has not yet started however.|Vehicles|20%|
**Universe Generation**|
The Universe is divided into sectors, planet generation and orbiter generation systems are complete. We may add more features to this, however, as well as the ability to insert hard-coded systems and special areas as we progress.|Universe / Sector Generation|90%|[1](http://playstarbound.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/sector.png)
A large number of biomes are present and content complete. There is always room to add additional trees, and completely new biomes. We’ll be constantly adding these post release.|Biome Content|90%|
We have a number of mini biomes per larger biome
The world generation code is capable of choosing biomes, liquids, weather, ore distribution, underground layers, cave structure and more. However these elements need to be tied to the planet’s level to create an overall difficulty.|World-level parameter gen|70%|
Planet art is generated to appear beneath the players ship when the player is in orbit. The planet art matches the biome present on the planet as well as the planet’s dominant liquid. The travel animation from planet to planet / solar system to solar system needs to be smoother. |Star / Planet orbital rendering|80%|[1](http://playstarbound.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/orbit.png)
World storage is largely complete

- Oil and gas (which would slowly escape from ""open spaces"") could be used as fuel to machines

- Quicksand

- Mud would be cool

- Poisoned water would act just like water but would deal damage if you swin on it or drink it.

1375252554.0,1jen56,Idea for late-game/multiplayer: Empire building!,Triarch,40,17,5,"What do I propose? I propose that we should be able to make our own interplanetary empire.

**But Triarch! How would we do this?**

We will already be able to set a homeworld. All you need to do to found your empire is build a capitol building on your homeworld and have several communities be signatories to an imperial charter.

**But doesn't that seem too easy? Any noob can make an empire right off the bat!**

Here's the hard part. The capitol building has to be of a sufficiently large size

There are multiple ways to make communities be signatories to the charter. One is to form an alliance with them. This usually isn't easy. Another is to kill their leader so they surrender. While killing the leader is much easier

**So what about the charter?**

All it basically does is incorporate your empire. At the signing

**Okay

* The signatories will now serve you, or build things. This is good for getting massive quantities of stuff.

* You can add new communities and planets to your empire whenever you want. To claim an uninhabited planet

* You can make your own army, mercenaries, prisoners of war, and slaves can be part of the army, with varying degrees of effectiveness based on experience and status.

* You can appoint imperial officials

* You don't even have to run your empire if you don't want to! Just appoint a leader to lead it for you. If you ever want to take back control of your empire

**This sounds way too good to be balanced. What are the disadvantages?**

* The empire needs to be defended from danger. This includes rival empires, or have your army do it for you.

* Signatories need to be kept happy (or sufficiently oppressed). If they aren't happy (or sufficiently oppressed)

* Building an army takes a massive amount of resources. Early on

* Only certain people can be imperial officials. This includes community leaders and certain other NPCs. You can also have other players as officials.

* If you appoint a leader to lead your empire for you

A strong modding community for a game adds tremendously to it's popularity and lifespan. Mods fill niche roles, take minecraft for instance. An enormous pool of mods has allowed minecraft to branch from rollplaying to hardcore PVP to creative building and much more, all from a vanilla game that wouldn't easily facilitate any of those game modes otherwise. The modding community has made minecraft what it is today.  

So comes Starbound. We all know how many amazing features are being supported from launch, be it creative, rollplaying, or hardcore PVP, or something totally different, makes the game, again

If you find yourself with a bit of free time, because everyone has their own personal opinion on what makes a product perfect. Similarly, as great as this game is looking to be, no set of vanilla features will be perfect from everyone's perspective. The diversifying effect of mods on a game and it's community is wonderful, and makes everyone's experience better.

A. No

**Q. Will I be notified when the game is available?**

My question is what happens after you have visited a planet? Does the game then create a save for that planet in the save file? Loading the planet the next time you visit from the seed generator would be incorrect

I am wondering how big the file would get if you spent an hour changing 1 block on as many planets as you can (for the sake of science!). Suddenly

Of course the devs are more than welcome to come in and offer input, they are more than entitled to flesh out their dream and concepts in the way they seem fit. Now onto the discussion.

I was really excited when I saw the procedural generation in the game. Especially with how good it looks so far (really really great job guys. You deserve some massive credit). And I have a list of pros that I saw for the randomization:

* Wide variety of environments can be easily made and experienced in a different order in each game. This will lead to creative structures based on resources and tiles you have available

* Cool enemies and a fresh experience on each world. Especially with the art on them

* The randomizability (lol that's a word now) of the engine does a nice job of emphasizing the infinite universe with unlimited combinations of outrageous environments. Very good for extended play late game.

But after thinking about this

Think about it. Terraria had such a concise experience that directly benefited from the design. There were always base level enemies (slimes) that served a purpose even when you outleveled them. Now you might only see things your level. Each enemy was designed with a specific behavior in mind. They didn't just attack with their randomly assigned stats, even with their beefed up stats, they won't be any more challenging than stuff I had on my first planet, they'll just do more damage. The design of the progression of enemies led directly to how weapon progression balanced against them. It was all a feat of design and testing that led to the whole experience and I'm afraid that the procedural generation will cause a loss of some of the game's cohesive and purposeful feel.

But the problem is

One possible solution would to give tons of pre-generated bosses and enemies the ability to land some of these debuffs

Basically, then arms, legs, and head (same time?), then whether or not it has wings, then stats.

We could either add another step in there: body type, elemental attribute, then stats*. If an elemental attribute is added, there will be minor appearance changes to show this. For fire, the enemy would have certain things about it on fire. It wouldn't matter whether it's just fists or the tip of a tail, or its entire back and head, as long as players notice it often. This would be determined much like ""should this have wings?"" is determined. I guess you wouldn't see many elemental winged enemies. It'd also be nice if fire-elemental enemies were more often speedier enemies, Freezing

*Alternative: Decide on whether or not it's elemental and what element before anything else

Another possible idea would be to program a few new main bodies, that have elemental appearances. Such as body parts made of fire, magma, ice crystal, snow, sludge, and so on. Any monster randomly generated with body parts like that gets those elemental attributes (might want to have the generator refuse to give the monster limbs of different elements though

Now, but what I saw was awesome. Tiy tried to stay away from big spoilers for the game, and kept a lower level character throughout the stream, and had relatively simple items (he was also dressed like a pirate). 

From what I saw from the stream, obviously. When I entered the fray, Tiy was in a pretty bland looking world in which he built a wooden cabin. The building was definitely Terraria-esque. Once it was finished, he added some furniture (wood) and doors (wood).

Afterwards, as it was completely soundless. The Avian ship looked quite nice, and he took us to a couple new planets. 

What really excited me was seeing the FTL jump into hyperspace, however, show us many new creatures that were, honestly, interesting but forgettable. 

My highlight of the stream was the airship. When Tiy took us to the second planet, then played some music while walking back.

Apparently, and started going up. After quite a while, he finally made it up.

What I  saw was indeed a Mario-styled airship with many crates and chests, why the hell would a developer add containers into a game that you can't open, that is my absolute video game pet peeve), and to my great pleasure he replied to my chat ingame, and said you could indeed open crates.

Sorry if this is long and rambling

Really excited for this game


At the end of a stream Legris said that he's amazed that the server's not dead, do you know if the bandwidth/cpu reqs on the serverside when this type of thing is going on? If it even starts to strain on a single world, how many worlds can even a high end commercial server run at once? I'd guesstimate &lt; 20 before it gets laggy when action is going on in all of them. How many players can a single world support?


The nature of the game having a ton of smaller isolated environments lends itself to having different sections of the galaxy on different servers and replicating the db. Then server owners could band together and form large clusters of players/planets without killing their bandwidth/individual servers. Too many players to handle on server a? Balance the load to server b.


I'd be really interested to see how far the engine can be pushed
Couple of other question if you have time


Are there any plans to have an (armed?) shuttle/ship that you can ""land"" / hover close to the ground on a planet, being able to teleport off of the surface anytime would make PvP for example a little less interesting.


Will there be a way to make a ground base that can withstand a fair attack? For example blocks that can take a beating, so you can make a group), auto/player controllable turrets etc (that don't fire on someone with the same item+code)? What about other things such as surface to surface (or subsurface) teleport platforms? Maybe even auto mining rigs + mineral scanners etc. Stuff like that seems like a great reason to need to build significant tech on a planet surface.


Speaking of which will there be some mechanism to track players across worlds (with perhaps a percentage chance of losing them everytime they change locations)? I'd love a tracking device or some such so that someone can't just beam away and totally prevent pursuit


What level of tech are you hoping to climb to? Are we talking just ""really powerful guns"" or demi-god level local time slowing field augmentations/planet crackers? Also even when you get said tech, either through gathering rare energy sources or slower but safer reactors etc. Part of the problem when you get to the end of a tech tree in games is the feeling that there's nothing else to work for. Having to power stuff may sound annoying but it's something to work together for and makes the end level stuff feel that more awesome.


Do you have plans for wireable fluid pumps so we can play with the awesome fluid engine? How bout a tool that can suck up/redistribute fluids.


Speaking of reactors, plus the tutorial could be encountering them already built.

With that said - I played Minecraft before I played Terraria. A friend of mine had a really difficult time convincing me that I'd like it. I hadn't played a 2D platformer in a long time, that 3D games can do very well (Minecraft included), is the ability for enemies to sneak up behind me. Having the character in the middle of the screen with the entire screen visible kind of ruins that feeling of paranoia that I get.

In thinking about what would make exploring many planets rewarding, but there are ways I see to enhance this experience.

First, but you could at least collect, transport, and perhaps breed them.

Imagine being able to keep an amazing monster, especially if creature interactions were built out. The code for pets is already being made... And what if you find a great creature to use for providing food, and you could transplant them to another world as a food source?

Tranqing might work like you have to inject enough tranquilizer into the creature to put it to sleep, but at least allow transport in the spaceship and breeding. I just very much like the idea of being able to collect and transport creatures across planets to allow for experimentation in creature interaction and habitats. You could make a sort of Noah's Ark planet with ALL of the creatures this way. That would be amazing.

A consideration if one could transport a creature... You would also have to be realistic about the creature's survivability in the new habitat. Is it devoid of oxygen? The creature would die. Is it an ice creature on a lava planet? The same. There would need to be realism.

In my mind there is much potential in building out the creature concept in this way. I would point to the success of Pokémon,,False,self,t5_2tkp6,False,,True

1. I am afraid that players will be able to share maps containing items they found and thus can create dupes.
