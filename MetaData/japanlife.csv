I'm an eikaiwa teacher, my boss dicked around and didn't prepare for my full time employment well enough, so up until the end of last month I didn't have textbooks, curriculum, advertising campaign, or anything for my eikaiwa lessons. sometimes I seriously want to ask her what the fuck she was thinking. anyhow... so basically I have 3 students, two of whom are from last year. (plus a once a month children's class) 

about my pay, let alone sign. my boss signed it. and when I told her I no longer wanted to live here she said I would have to pay the remaining months' rent in order to move out. at the end of 1 year, the housing contract will be up (and I will also have to re-apply for a work permit). 

so, my current salary is the absolute lowest... it's what I would get if I had no students. so at 3 students it should be a bit higher, but nope. last year I also had 6 students at one time but my pay did not increase. later, I am going to talk to her about when I can expect a raise.

so, can I be fired if I do that? (in my work contract, it says I may be let go due to ""bad attitude"")

2) if things continue as they are (I hope not because I want to stay at this company (because my students paid a lot in 入会金, or be let go due to the inability to extend my work permit. so what options are there for someone like me? I am hoping to get some extra qualifications in case I have to look for another job. right now I'm working on Kanji kentei (5) and Nihongo kentei (N1) but are there any other ""shikaku"" I would be able to study for? I'm willing to do any job, would rather get away from teaching, but wouldn't mind going to another eikaiwa as long as it keeps me in japan. by the end of this year I'll have had 2 years experience teaching eikaiwa.

What other options/resources are there for someone like me?

please and thank you. m(-_-)m

I'm half New Zealander and half Japanese I was born in Japan but left the country before I was 5 so I really don't have much memory of this place. My mother forced me to speak in Japanese in the household so I wouldn't forget my language. Thanks to her I'm bilingual and can speak both English and Japanese fluently. 

I came back to Japan because I love Manga
I even went to Comiket that happend a week ago!

But the sad thing is.... even after living here for 1 and a half years... I have no friends....

It might be because I've been living overseas for most of my life... but  Japan's society is really good at making you feel like you don't belong. 
When you do something different people look at you like you're some kind of alien. When you ask what something is

When I talk to people about anime

I'm 20 and live in Tokyo. What should I do?

I am frequently on the phone via skype talking in a regular voice
So I got a call last week from Leopalace telling me that someone complained about noise and to keep it down and whether I had company. I told them I was alone that I was only on the phone and I will keep it down.
Fast forward a week, but I was alone, so I told him I was only on the phone. So he took my contact details down and then left.
The police officer was very

Do you guys have any ideas on what I could do? Keep in mind that my Japanese is absolutely minimal

EDIT: I am trying to reply to everyone (thanks for your ideas and support!)

EDIT2: I am not sure who complained as last night there was no light in my neighbors apartment

Also

I will also tell my language school about what happened and see what they have to say.

I will also stop by Leopalace and tell them what happened just to appear more proactive.

PS: I'd hate to be that gaijin guy that justifies anti-gaijin sentiments. So I really don't want to fight. I feel that I am a guest in this country, then I feel automatically my host is in the right and it's my duty to sort things out instead of fighting and justifying how I didn't do anything wrong. After all, this is why lots of places don't seem to welcome gaijin, because there are always problems with them, so I want to be extra nice and careful.

EDIT3: so I went to the embassy this morning, isn't it"". I didn't expect much but she said I can call a number there at the embassy if things escalate, which I don't really expect. Nice to see the embassy and all the other embassies around, though.

After that, I am assuming they called about yesterday. That was on my way to Leopalace itself.

So I arrived at Leopalace, but the English staff was ""out"". This is why I love Japan, and I am not sarcastic when I say that. But the lady was super nice and after I tried to explain in simple words what I was here for, she called a translator via the phone so the entire conversation happened by passing the phone back and forth and smiling at each other which was interesting. Turns out, that apparently there are no complaints about my apartment on file. There was some noise, but apparently not from my apartment, which explains the letter which was put into every single letterbox. That doesn't really explain why I got two calls from Leopalace, and then the second time this morning. But I didn't insist. Second, so it sounds possible considering I had recently moved and since I registered my new address they surely new that a gaijin was in town and probably from that could have decided to pay a visit.
I still feel that something is a little fishy about this, but if I wanted to risk it, then the weekend during the day would be best, so I suggested Saturday around 1-2pm which is when I will pay a visit to my neighbor next door and below me to treat them to a small cake thing or Krispy Kreme? and a little note leaving my phone number so they can text me unobtrusively out of the comfort of their home if I do end up being to loud.
My girlfriend, but I think it doesn't hurt to be extra-nice, especially considering that I am a guest in this country and will naturally meet a little more resistence than otherwise. Plus I want to get to know the neighbors anyway. :)

Please note that I am writing in such detail because I think someone else might profit from this

EDIT4: So I got another call from Leopalace just this morning (Saturday). This time, I did have the window open, so maybe that way it was heard and ""bothered"" someone. Unbelievable. Of course it sounded bad to admit I was listening to music, I mean if someone is complaining about that, then it had to have been loud, but I swear it was absolutely normal volume. I will still follow through with my gift-giving this afternoon and see how it turns out.

EDIT5: So I bought two small gifts this morning, it was around 1 pm Saturday. Nobody opened. I decided to put the letter and the candybox in the letterbox and went upstairs to my next-door neighbor. I rang there as well, but he/she didn't seem to be home. So I left the mini-towel gift and the envelope in the letter box and left to run errands myself. So I returned at around 6pm, it was already dark, and the next-door neighbor had put my mini-towel gift along with the envelope back into my letterbox. Neither the letter nor the gift had been opened. Even though it was already dark, I figured I would ring the bell next door regardless, it was still early (6pm), so I left again. This just happened

EDIT6: My gf told me not to go to Leopalace as they won't do anything anyway and I think she is right. I stopped calling my friends altogether and switched to email. No music or TV for me either.

1350593385.0,11pk6h,Life in Japan vs. Life in Korea. Thoughts?,BarneyKerbopple,17,5,36,"I taught English for 2 years in South Korea. I'm thinking about possibly going to Japan to teach English for a few more years before coming back to the US to start a real career. I've visited Japan 4 times myself so I know what the country is like on the surface but I haven't lived there before so I can't say what life as a foreigner there is truly like. 

There were a couple things about life in Korea that nagged me enough to get me to leave after 2 years. I'm wondering if Japan will be any different. Some of the things that got to me the most: ultra nationalism, institutionalized discrimination, lack of proper hygiene and dirty country (relatively speaking of course), lack of natural beauty, sameness and ugliness of cities, lack of subcultures, etc. I'll stop myself there. 

Now if any of you have spent time in Korea you are more than welcome to share your opinions. I don't expect Japan to be a land of unicorns and cotton candy. I'm just hoping that Japan won't be like a shinier version of Korea for me generally speaking. Like I said I've been there 4 times and it looked nicer, there was more natural beauty, and the food was better. Apart from that I cannot say what it'll be like. I don't want another Korea. I should mention that I plan to live in the big cities only because I know people will be a bit more cosmopolitan there. 

If I get the impression that Japan won't be much different I think I'll start looking more seriously into working in Europe or South America. The only issues there are the difficult visas for Americans and the low pay. I'd rather not have to lose money to live abroad. That said

Lastly

UPDATE (2013/4/5): Met with lawyers today
1. What happens to the 2 years left on my visa since I haven't worked in 6 month?
and 2. What do I need for an investors visa?

They said that without work it's not legal to stay here (didn't tell me a time frame), ""maybe."" They told me to carry my Hello Work in the case that they did ask me anything, to show that I'm at least looking for work. And you have to be working for a year to collect unemployment.

For an investor visa, business and personal. It can be one house that been divided into two levels, using one level as a business. You also need a detailed business plan that goes out 3 years. Once you have a rental agreement, the business plan, and the money you can apply for the visa. Also if you have a Japanese business partner you can skip the ¥5million.

The 2011 JET Program announcements came out and I've been placed as an alternate.  That means I have a chance to teach in Japan if somebody drops out of the program.  However, even though I had planned to go through private teaching companies if I didn't get it.  I've spent six months in Japan a few years ago after being laid off at my previous job (they filed for bankruptcy and laid off 30 of the newest hires nationwide).  That experience opened my eyes and Japan has been a huge passion for me ever since.  But with this possible rejection from the JET Program, I feel like I'll never be able to return to Japan.


  My plan B was to get to Japan through another teaching company.  I've looked into JoyTalk and PeppyKidsClub, considering I'll be in a foreign country.


  A little background about myself: I don't like anime and I don't play many video games.  I know that Japan is much more than that.  I don't understand much of the language (I can read and write hiragana, but I am actively studying.

I have two installments left on my ward's inhabitance tax (住民税) totalling 60

My second question:
This one is regarding my national health insurance but pretty much the same question. If I leave without paying the remainder of this year's insurance premiums would it be a problem upon return? Should I speak to someone about this as well? Or would they simply see that I was paid up until the time I left?

Tokyo needs to tell the Okinawan governor, ""If you want money, sign it (agree to the relocation plan)."" There is nowhere else to base U.S. Marines. The DPJ suggested a replacement facility in mainland Japan, but there is no place in mainland Japan for the U.S. military.

First off, go to an agency, preferably in the area you are looking since to my experience the retailers know their area but are close to utterly useless at even neighbouring areas. Some of them will treat you badly, some of them won't. Choose the ones that you get along with.

If you are looking for an apartment of your own I am assuming you have by now understood that at most times English is a no-go, it pays off to be picky and only be flexible with what you really can tolerate to change. Bad deals will come your way, especially if you like me have a limited budget and is looking in central Tokyo.

Okay, but, well). There has been a series of building reforms in Japan in order to make sure that buildings won't kill you, these are the ones I know of 1979, June 1981 and 2000. I heard there was also one after the Great Hanshin Quake (Kobe) in 1995, but I have not been able to verify it. Let's move on to building materials.

The quality of the houses is generally not on par with what I as a European considers good (mind you, no. Get a heater. Single glass windows and wind that moves your curtains even when closed can be expected. The materials used are primarily wood, steel and concrete.

Wood, but remember that they are ranked as bad when it comes to earthquake safety and you could end up hearing your neighbours as if you lived with them and the traffic as if you lived on the street.

Steel

Concrete

Even after all this, all I got from the real estate agents when asking was smiles or laughter, they never knew about it for the houses in my price range and nor did the owners.

So, but then the place is usually a bit shady and they are desperate to let it go). This is just another custom that we all have to get used to. You will also pay a deposit of roughly the same size, and don't be fooled by the name, you are not all that likely to get it back when you move. On top of this you need to pay one month of rent to the real estate agency as a thank you to them. All in all, have savings ready to cover this.

I am currently in my final year of Mechatronics Engineering

Warning: long post. Also

**Background**

I have looked at various labs

I graduate in April

In June I will go back for a couple of weeks for convocation

**N.B.** My marks in University are not great (~60-70% in a very tough program, now that I can pick courses that interest me. I was told by those profs on separate occasions that, so long as I have a prof backing me, all I need is to do the entrance exam and interview. I am not sure if the grade matters for a scholarship... [2]

The Masters program would take two years to complete. Some universities, I will (assuming I have the knowledge I need) start my own company in researching myoelectric prosthetics (or something else that might be interesting me then). [3,4]

[edit] As part of my university studies, two jobs were in small companies, and two were in research labs at universities. Also, I always pack light (everything fits in one suitcase/on the back of my bicycle), and can get along just fine in small spaces as long as I have something to do during the day, and internet at home.

**About me**

From lurking in this and the /r/japan subreddit, White, and I speak seven languages, English being one of my four native languages. I have no dependents. Also, I have never been to Japan.

**Japanese ability**

I speak Japanese fluently for the most part, so it doesn't look too pretty. I also have lots of Japanese friends in Japan. (99%+ of them I met when they were in Canada on exchange or tourism), and I think I would be able to rely on a few of them.

I learned the language primarily on my own over the past three years. I learn like a baby as opposed to formally, but hoping to do that in Winter, when I will be having the opportunity. I was given a Japanese name since no-one could pronounce my name without completely butchering it.

As for technical Japanese, and we are translating the assignments from English and doing them in Japanese (just ODEs/Calculus for now, but at least I am getting math practice). [5]

**Questions from the above**

The questions I am asking here is because literally everyone I know in Japan is Japanese

[1] If I get accepted

[2] What scholarship should/could I get

[3] Is opening a company realistic for me as a foreigner? What challenges/benefits are there. Are there any requirements (Japanese ownership etc)? What would I need?

[4] Is it usually allowed to build on lab research when opening a company? Or would it be better/possible to just work in said lab? I am planning on open-sourcing my designs (mechanical, system), but that is another discussion.

[5] How can I improve my technical Japanese?

**Other Questions**

* What else should I do to prepare?
* What should I do when I get here?
* What can I expect for overall costs?
* I have three passports. What would it take to get Japanese nationality?
* [edit] Should I bring my bicycle with me or should I buy/rent one here? If so

I've been planning to move permanently to japan since I was about 17, and getting my BA in japanese language and culture. (now I'm between JLPT 2 and 1 level) I've had all sorts of people along the way doubt me and my abilities/dedication but I ignored them and pushed on.

I've finally got the chance to go there and will be shipping out around dec. 15; I have a job and homestay lined up at a NPO english conversation school run by a Tenrikyo woman I know and she has agreed to let me work there and stay for a year. I will be getting a working holiday visa and she has signed a guarantor form for me.

during my year there I'm planning to do some job hunting all around japan for a full time job, am/will be fluent in japanese and english (and speak french) and have worked at several factories.  

1) I do not have my jlpt 1kyuu yet, or is my BA a sufficient credential? do you think a company like ogasaka ski would consider me for some sort of ""foreign correspondent"" or *any* office position and sponsor me in the long term? I would definitely be a lowly OL if it meant I could stay in japan.

1b.) in case I can't find an office job, but I will have a year's worth of experience at two private schools (the conversation one and another non-NPO school, both part time jobs) and a BA from a canadian university. is that enough?

1c.) is it advantageous to write your resume and cover letter in japanese when applying to either job (english teacher or OL)

2) I heard that there are 3 income tax categories

(a side note

2b.) health insurance. do most employers have a plan? if not how do I get it as a foreigner? (I'll get travel insurance for my first year)

3) what should I do for housing in (assuming I get a job there) nagano? how did you find your housing and what were the obstacles in finding/renting/moving in?

I'm sorry if this is stupid/too long or if there are too many posts like this. I have so many questions swimming around in my head.

[Facebook Japan Surfing Group](http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=2607416120) - pretty self-explanatory.

[Murasaki Sports](http://www.murasaki.co.jp/) Is a (very overpriced) mall store much like Hot Topic or West 49 (in Canada) that I'd avoid but you can often find sales on out of season wetsuits and stuff. 

[Yahoo Auctions](http://auctions.yahoo.co.jp/) is a good place to buy NOS (new old stock) gear

WonderRex - Formerly HARD-OFF - is a used shop that almost always has surfing gear. Currently the one near my house has 3 longboards and about 5 shorties, but they have since been bought out by (yes, you heard it, WonderGoo) so you have to go to the [WonderGoo] (http://www.wonder.co.jp/) website to access Wonder Rex for your area.

I'm Joël

I don't like to say it but I'm 'smart'. Ever since I was little school was no challenge for me and this lead to some major problems. By the end of high school I got depressed and felt disconnected from other teenagers and even from my friends. Because I really never had to do my best for anything I never learned to do my best and this led to some motivational problems I'm currently still dealing with. 

I graduated from high school two years ago and I also got a Cambridge English diploma. I started studying at a university but I just couldn't motivate myself to work for it. I quit and worked a bit for the rest of the school year. I started studying again this september but it's still not working out. I've been improving a lot over the past year but I've decided that I want to quit studying again and see what my options are for going to Japan. 

I've always done things because they we're expected off me by my parents or the society in general. I started studying because my parents and everyone around me always told me how smart I was and because it is just the normal thing to do here.

Now I've finally found something I really want to do because I want it myself. Going to Japan. Right now I'm basically looking for the best way I can get to Japan and actually do something there. I've been looking into studying Japanese in Japan and I've just now discovered [Go Go Nihon](http://gogonihon.com). They seem to have some good options but I'm wondering if there are any other possibilities.

I do not have a lot of money but I'm taking a job this week and I want to safe everything up for Japan. I've started studying Japanese a bit and am currently looking for classes in my neighbourhood.

* *Is it better to start studying at a university again and aim for something like an exchange year or a major in Japan*?
* *Is it possible to do any kind of wildlife or captive animal care in Japan like working for some animal park or a zoo*?

I'm basically stuck with all these questions which most likely do not have clear answers which is why I'm asking for some general advice. Maybe you can share your own experiences with me. Naturally I want to go as soon as possible. 

If you need any information or have any questions please ask. Any help is greatly appreciated.

Thank you

Joël

Is my career/life plan way too simple? I.E. am I being too naive about how easy it's going to be? I do have teaching in Korea as a back-up plan (since I'm under the thinking that it's easier to get admitted there than it is to Japan through JET)

I also have a real knack for Japanese language. I don't know whether it's only because I've been learning the simple stuff up until this point, too, and other nuances I've also got!

And I don't really have any idea how extreme Japan is with appearance, but maybe not?

I've been looking at houses in our town (Kashima

Thing is, bumbling people I've ever dealt with.

I also know that big rental sites like [賃貸 Chintai](http://www.chintai.net) and others let you search by 礼金なし・敷金なし and that is one route I'm thinking of taking.

But one thing I would really like to bypass is these companies altogether and just rent from some old couple who have an extra house. Which leads me to my question - is there such thing as a network that cuts out these middlemen altogether? Sounds like a pipe dream

I have seen signs around my town (usually at the wrong time and/or in neighborhoods that aren't desirable for my wife and I) that advertise ""house for rent"" scrawled in graffiti-like writing to know that it's something that is done

So... for the TL;DR crew

1. Want to bypass the dipshit rental companies in my town
2. Would like to not pay 礼金・敷金
3. Would like to deal with only a single person or family face to face rather than go to an office
4. Would maybe just like to know how to say ""For rent by owner"" in natural Japanese to find if ""For rent by owner"" is enough of a phenom in Japan that I'd be able to google it for my own town.

When you sign up for a connection you need to sign up for all these stupid bonus programs, then they would cost a significant amount of money for things I did not want. So I called SoftBank BB and wanted to cancel them. What shocked me was that they started asking me ""Are you using WiFi?"", it had never occurred to me that there was actually an option for that. I initially pondered if people just happily admitted to be using the WiFi and paid for it, for how could they control if I was using WiFi? I also found out that I was paying a monthly fee for that blasted AP and told them to cancel it, so that my service would only include what I actually wanted, an internet connection.

WTF?,,14,16,28,"I have been in Japan for awhile and I ""know the deal"" but in the past few months I am finding the whole thing annoying. More so I am finding some Japanese women's mentality annoying. Who knows

It's not only this one friend either but a few buddies of mine have just been bringing home girls left and right. It's gotten to the point where I'd rather hangout with Japanese friends because it feels ""normal"". Obviously they are on the prowl too but the nannpa is within the bounds of reason. 

Now

When we do go out for drinks and end up talking to girls, which is cool if I am in the mood to be objectified (which is pretty much never). And even rarer we meet a group of girls who sees us as people and treats us that way. This is the best scenario because we all just have fun. It's also nice to see one of our moteki friends crash an burn when their ""Hello, my name is ~. Let's go to back to my place."" pick up line doesn't work so well.

I don't know. It's just becoming predictable and boring. It's like we can't go out and chill without some girls creaming their pants at my friends. On one hand I want them to take advantage of the situation but on the other I just want to kick it with my homeboys.

About Me:

I am an American-born Photography student living in Kanagawa. After coming to Japan
When walking
I've heard stories of people approached by people asking if they can touch them. The reasoning being ""I've never seen a foreigner before""
When ordering food
I seek to document how we, at its core the perks are simply because you are not, and possibly in our lifetime never will be, Japanese.

The shoot can be in the streets nearest your homestation, I'd like to experience it or perhaps photograph you there. This is a volunteer position, so I can't compensate, I'm sorry.",,False,self,False,t3_14jobi
