&gt;I think that people who have gotten off of their butts and have run 5k totally deserve credit and congratulations. If people start later in the program because they were beginning from a more advance fitness level, completely ignoring 2/3rds of the program, you are no longer doing the program.

I had been doing every week twice, as long as I did at least 8+8, I would count it as w5d2 and do w5d3 next run. 

But I had seen so many posts from people who successfully completed w5d3 when they didnt think they would and that most of it was mental blocks at that point than physical inability that I knew I could do it if I just didnt psych myself out. 

I set the speed for .1mph slower than I have been running and told myself I had to go for at least 5-6 songs before I was even allowed to uncover the timer. I checked after 5 songs and I was right at 25:10!

I updated my fb about it while still on the treadmill haha. A couple minutes later

1363703793.0,1aleab,50 Running tips for beginners,julez413,155,16,68,"I found this on a blog called [Back on Pointe](http://backonpointe.tumblr.com/post/29709655551/smartgirlsanddumbbells-health-freeak-running)

Running Tips:

1.	Wear spandex shorts under your regular running shorts so you donât chafe
2.	Cotton socks will only lead to blisters; invest in socks designed for running.
3.	Join your local running clubâcheck with your local running store fitness center and/or recreation department to find one
4.	Find a committed running partner. It is much harder to skip a run when you have someone else depending on you
5.	Remember that- It gets easier.
6.	Accept and appreciate the fact that not every single run can be a good one
7.	Do not compare yourself to others. Run within yourself and for yourself first.
8.	Even a bad run is better than no run at all
9.	If you normally run with music try skipping it and listening to your feet to hear your pace and your gait
10.	Donât be discouraged if you donât experience weight loss immediately
11.	Start a running blog
12.	Hydrate. Make it a habit to drink water throughout the day
13.	On long runs eat something every hourâwhether you feel like it or not
14.	During longer runs if you donât like to carry water take some cash in your pocket pouch or a shoe wallet. Run a route where thereâs a corner store that you can use as a pit stop to pick up your water and maybe use the bathroom
15.	To aid recovery the most crucial time to eat and drink is in the hour immediately after you run
16.	Use Vaseline or BodyGlide wherever things rub. They will help prevent blisters and chafing
17.	Do not increase your mileage more than 10 percent per week
18.	If you are prone to shin splints and lower leg pain try running soft trails for your Training runs and save the asphalt for race day
19.	Do not run two hard days back-to-back
20.	Ice aches and pains immediately
21.	Pay attention to your form. Try to run lightly to minimize impact that could lead to injury
22.	When running donât forget the bug spray
23.	Neosporin (or another antibiotic cream) is good for chafed areas
24.	Make sure you cut your toenails short enough so they donât jam into your Shoes
25.	Be careful about running on paths that force you to run consistently on a slant. Itâs hard on the hips knees
26.	Donât stretch before a run. Warm up by walking briskly or jogging slowly for several minutes
27.	Do not ice for more than 20 minutes at a time
28.	For beginners, run between street lights then walk between street lights, run till the next bus stop, until you pass a car on the street)
29.	Do not use the hot tub after a race. It will increase inflammation and hinder healing
30.	Be aware of cyclists approaching you from behind and try to keep to the right. Try to pay special attention when running with music
31.	Run facing traffic.
32.	Never assume a car sees you
33.	Double-knot your shoe laces so they will not come undone when you run\
34.	If you listen to music, it will fall out
35.	Buy yourself some actual running shoes from an actual running store because running in junk âsneakersâ will destroy your feet and your legs
36.	At first keep your runs short and slow to avoid injury and soreness so you do not quit.
37.	If you are breathing too hard slow down or walk a bit until you feel comfortable again
38.	Pick your route close to home (out your front door)âthe more convenient it is the better chance you will have sticking with it.
39.	Set realistic short term and long term goals
40.	Remember Soreness one to two days after a run is normal (delayed onset muscle soreness).
41.	Thereâs no shame in walking
42.	Four laps around the local the high school track equals one mile
43.	Vary your training routes. This will prevent boredom and prevent your body from getting acclimated
44.	Push through rough spots by focusing on the sounds of your breath and feet touching the ground
45.	Do abdominal breathing to get rid of side cramps
46.	Run on trails if at all possible. It will be easier on your body and youâll love it
47.	Dress as if it is 10 degrees warmer than the temperature on the thermometer
48.	Run early in the morning or later in evening to avoid mid-day heat
49.	To keep cool in hot weather soak a bandana in cold water wring it out a bit and tie it loosely around your neck
50.	In the winter dress in layers (coolmax or other technical clothing) and wear a headband over your running hat to cover your ears

1357965323.0,16f7kb,6 months ago I gave birth. 3.5 months ago I started C25K. This is what I accomplished today!,rosamor86,166,27,19,,t5_2rgoq,False
1328468861.0,pc3nk,No excuses.  290lbs and just completed couch-to-5k.,Litre,150,6,28,"**Background**

After getting word from my doctor that at the age of 32, but I hadn't always been that way.  In high school, I played football and baseball and averaged out between 180-190lbs @ 6'2"".  Not too terrible.  It was after graduation that I started packing on the pounds.

Like many people of my generation, I abandoned my active lifestyle and made entertainment my main time-passer when not at work.  To compound the issue, I have a desk-job, where I'm literally tied to my desk 7-8 hours a day.  Those that work in a call-center understand what I'm talking about.

So, and at such a young age, there wasn't anything that could possibly be wrong with me.
I went in, and then proceeded into the exam room to wait for the doctor and the inevitable bad news.  She let me know what I already knew.  If I didn't change my lifestyle, I wasn't going to live to see much past 40-or-50 years old.  This hit me hard, but in a very good way.

I'm a very goal-oriented person, at this point, doubled as a coat-hanger), I settled on the couch-to-5k treadmill version.
I moved the treadmill from a storage room in the house, and as football taught me, shin splints as well.  I knew that if I overdid it, hurt myself, or simply couldn't complete a day or week in the program, I'd become disheartened and lose interest.  I settled on 4mph.

Now, I set off.  Here are some thoughts I did a rough journal on, over the program:

* Week 1 - With the pace I've selected
* Week 2 - Only 30-seconds longer.  This week has gone by easily as well.  The last intervals are a bit tougher
* Week 3 - Three-minute runs are daunting
* Week 4 - The five-minute runs are tough
* Week 5 - What is this sorcery?  I've steadily moved up in my run times, day 3.  I ran for 20-minutes.  HUGE!
* Week 6 - Since I did my 20-minute run
* Week 7 - Three 25-minute runs.  They went off without a hitch.  Dare I say
* Week 8 - 28-minutes.  No sweat.  Just three minutes longer than last week.
* Week 9 - Day 1 I got horrible shin pain on my left leg.  I had to take an extra day to recoup.  Day 2 helped me figure out what I was doing wrong (running pigeon-toed).  Day 3 went great

**Lessons learned**

* Get a good pair of shoes.  I was using some four-year-old tennis shoes when I started out.  I was exhausted after exercising.  After finding a good pair of shoes
* Chaffing hurts!  Buy compression shorts, your thighs rubbing together is a bad thing.  
* The largest hurdle you're going to encounter is yourself.  This isn't an easy endeavor, discomfort - these are all things that will happen occasionally.  Your brain will be steadfast in telling you to stop, or help you come up with convenient excuses not to proceed. 
* The biggest mental and physical hurdle for me was week 5
* Remember: The only person that can tell you that you can't do this is yourself.  You don't have to listen.
* Endeavoring to complete couch-to-5k will build your confidence.  I feel better than I have in years.  As a direct result, and even talked about my C25K journey.

**Future plans**

* Speed.  I need to increase my speed.  I'm working with a physical trainer friend of mine, but I'm going to try and I'm going to do so in a safe manner so as to not injure myself.
* Actually running three miles.  This week I'm going to do another two days of 30-minutes @ 4MPH just to establish that as my baseline and to create a bit more endurance.  On the third day, I'll be on the treadmill.  Week-after-next, I'm going to up the incline to 1%.  The weeks following, I'll bump up in .2 to .4 increments and monitor/adjust accordingly.  This will be a dynamic process and I understand that my goals may outpace my actual ability, so I'll scale increases as they're appropriate.
* Run a 5k.  As stated above
* Train for and run a 10k.  My wife and I are registering for a local ""dirty-dash"".  While not a legitimate 10k, and depending on how that goes, I'll sign up for an official 10k.
* Shed the pounds.  I've lost 45lbs so far.  I have a long way to go

Secondly

On my first day of college

&gt; Showing up is 80% of passing. Just show up to class.

Short and simple, you have to get off of your ass and do it. You're going to have days you don't want to do your scheduled run but I can **promise** you that you will be glad you got out there and did it.

**Disclaimer**: This is what has worked for me. I understand that what I say will not apply to everyone so take what I say with a grain of salt.

**Me**: 28/5'10""/m. I started the program at 245 and I'm currently 230

1. **Clothes**: As a fat man

2. **Diet**: I have always given myself at least 3 hours after eating before running and I also do not drink any water within 30-60 minutes prior. You shouldn't need to bring water with you during such a short workout but you should ensure you're well-hydrated prior to leaving the house.

3. **Speed**: It is irrelevant. It is irrelevant. It is absolutely irrelevant. This program is designed to get you to run a 5K and has absolutely nothing to do with how quickly you can finish. If you run a sub 10-minute mile, and that's all that matters.

4. **Shoes**: This is a hot-button issue in the running world. I went to a New Balance store where I was fit with a pair of shoes that I love. They were $150 so the skeptic in me can't help but think I was taken for a ride

5. **Form**: I'm too lazy to dig-up the YouTube video I based my form around but I can summarize it pretty easily: Utilize a small, don't use a long stride that causes you to land on your heels. Have your arms bent at a 90 degree angle and try to minimize movement of your torso. Your hands should never cross the midline of your chest.

6. **Failure**: Failure was the best thing to happen to me in this program. I made it W6D3 without failing a single run and because I had W5D3 under my belt, which **will** happen to you. But you've just got to get back out there and do it again. Though I pouted and moped around, feeling like a complete failure for the rest of that evening, I woke up the next morning knowing that I could do it. I took two days off and kicked W6D3's ass.

You absolutely can finish this program but you're going to have to get out there and do it. I'd be willing to bet the majority of failures in this program are those who have simply given in to laziness and decided not to lace up their running shoes.

I sincerely wish you all good luck and good health. This community has been a huge motivator for me and has no-doubt contributed to my success.

I'm 26, with a bad knee from football in high school among other issues. I've also been doing the 100 pushups plan and I'm currently up to week 2 day 3 column 3 of that. 

I was always one of the kids in school who couldn't finish the mile run in a reasonable time

I've had a few problems with running the program. Two days after a successful week 4 day 1 run with some minor but noticeable pain in the back of my ankles, instead choosing to walk quite a bit of the run because I felt a very similar pain. This time, though, I managed to push through and succeed.

The change is pretty large. I'm amazed that I actually feel *good* after running rather than just like complete sweaty fat shit like I used to. (I still feel sweaty and fat

I've always been shy and anxious

Muscular? Fat-bellied

Every run is a bitch and a half and despite the sidebar that suggests you shouldn't be winded, and like I said, if I can do it, you can too.

Nine weeks ago, I was a little naive about running). I was going to be a shredded athletic guy for my upcoming vacation, and I was going to be a frontrunning beast when I showed up to my first 5k run. I was going to force myself through the program, work my butt off, hate every second of it, and live a success story.

It just didn't happen. I didn't lose 15 pounds; I lost five pounds. Six pack? Not even close. I still have plenty of fat around my midsection. I got nowhere *near* the 21 minute 5k, but after tonight, I have realized something: I have never felt as enthusiastic about and invigorated by an activity as I have about running. I have succeeded on another level.

Around Week 8, everything changed around the halfway point of my W8D2 run. I realized that I wasn't even tired--that I was enjoying the serenity of just keeping a pace, enjoying the outdoors, and taking laps around the park. A little while later, when Constance said ""Walk,"" I felt disappointed that the run was over. I honestly wanted to keep going.

It was a big changing point for me. I really feel that I just want to run for the sake of running. Yes, I'd like to shed off those few extra pounds, but it's not even a real issue to me. Right now, I just want to run. Nothing before has ever made me feel as good about myself.

A little back story:
July 5th 2012 I was a staggering 390lbs. Got down to about 335 on diet alone, I saw a lot of talk about C25K. Decided to give it a shot.
So on October 31st i had the last cigarette of my life
As a former athlete I knew the drill, I set my walk at 3.0mph and my runs at 5.0mph.
Slowly but surely the huffing and puffing added up
Maybe its the sado-masachist inside me
Regardless, allbeit less so, and a non smoker for over 2 months, able to run 30 minutes non stop at 5mph. No, it isn't quite 3 miles, but I'll get there. I know I will, because beyond the physical triumphs

TL;DR
300lb man quit smoking and stated running.

Coming into day one of week seven I thought it would hopefully go a little better and the last 5 minutes would feel a little easier as my body adjusted. Except I had a long arse day at work and when I get home it starts to piss it down with rain. I think 'bugger it' and venture out anyway. I decide not to wear my earphones for fear of getting them wet. So Runkeeper is announcing every 5 minutes from my pocket.
The first 5 minutes are terrible. My breathing is screwed, in fact my pace is below W6D3. I tell myself ""It's ok, you need to save energy for the end"". I get really slow towards the 20th minute. It arrives. I think ""Well, this isn't so bad, nowhere near Tuesday. Let's ramp up the speed for the last 5"" and so I do. Oh god it feels great. Before felt like hobbling, this is RUNNING! Suddenly the disembodied voice in my pocket announces that 25 minutes have passed and I should stop running. ""Well sod that, this is too much fun. I'm nowhere near worn out. Let's keep going to the end of the street."" This then turns into the next street. Another. One more. OK let's get to the main road then stop.


29 MINUTES. I couldn't believe it. I'd smashed through 25 minutes and almost hit week 9! I've been on a high ever since. I'd seen the posts here from people suddenly bursting beyond the constraints of their assigned week but jealously dismissed them as people who were obviously fitter than I when they started this. How else could they find it so much easier? The truth is this thing just works and works absurdly well. All it takes is the willpower to make it happen.

A little background: If you had used the word ""athletic"" to describe me at any time before this past fall

I first encountered C25K last June, I was looking for a way to get into running and thought this would be a good place to start. I went out for W1D1, and... sputtered. I made it to the fourth running interval and had to give up - my body just couldn't take it.

Later in the summer, started changing up my diet, having completely forgotten about C25K. In October (after losing 40 lbs.), I found this subreddit and managed to convince myself to give it another go. So I went out for another go at week 1, and it went pretty well! I mean... at a couple of points during that week I wanted to throw up, but I powered through and was able to finish.

I can't really pinpoint what my motivation was during the first couple of weeks - it was mostly ""I have no reason *not* to follow the program, you get the realization of ""wait, I'm supposed to be able to run a 5K pretty soon... oh, I bet I'll actually be able to do it when the time comes."" And so I did. Week 9 for me was last Monday, Wednesday and Friday, and I went out and did my half-hour each day! And didn't get to a 5K distance. (I may not be fat anymore, but I'm still pretty slow.)

So

...

...and it worked! I ran my first 5K today with a finish time of 38:55! My time isn't particularly impressive

If you've made it this far (and maybe are looking to get started on C25K yourself)

- SLOW DOWN! I know this gets hammered into people's heads around here, just as a function of being in better shape. On my W5D3 run I didn't make it much farther than 2 km in 20 minutes, but it gets easier as it goes on if you don't push yourself so hard.

- If you're doing this to get healthy

- If you fail one day... so? You're still running more than you used to! Just get out there the next time and kick some ass.

- Have fun out there! Improving your way of life doesn't have to be a chore!

I tried, and stopped running for a while. Then I got depressed, then I ate like crap, and (shocker) felt even worse. Wash, rinse, and repeat.

So, and I resolved to get back to it. I put my brace on my knee and got to work. I had been out of it for so long though that even getting through W1 was a struggle at first, and I kept bouncing back and forth between W1 and W2, and not really committing to the program. 

Then probably a couple months ago I really decided that I needed to do this, and hovered there for a couple weeks.

This week, waiting. I remembered how it had precipitated my downfall almost two years ago.

Today, after all, never run 20 minutes in one sitting before *plus* I had all that psychological baggage about it from before. I honestly didn't know if I could do it. My thought to myself when I started running was ""Well, I'll just see how far I can get.""

Turns out

It was a surprisingly emotional experience for me. When I finished I had to try to *not* break down and cry (then folks would have certainly thought I was crazy). 

**TL;DR** I'm grateful to this place and you guys and gals for the encouragement. I'm looking forward to starting W6 Monday with the knowledge that a lot of what I thought were my limits aren't really limits at all.

Up until today

Last night, calls me up and tells me she has an extra number for a 5 mile race in the morning and to meet her at her house at 9am with my running shoes on ready to go. I had just worked a 8 and a half hour shift with no break at my new job as a dishwasher, my feet were killing me, and I knew I couldn't run the whole thing and didn't want to embarrass myself. I told her I would go but would run half and walk the other half. 

I woke up this morning exhausted and the last thing I wanted to do was run. Reluctantly, added 3 scoops of Amino X and walked over to her house. We picked up a few of her other runner friends and got over to the race spot. 

I turn on my favorite running album (Lace Up mixtape by MGK) and went at it. I kept my aunt in sight and tried to maintain a steady pace. There was a pretty big hill in the first mile that threw me off

2.5 miles in, and felt really good! I tried to be effective by running in straight lines, sticking to the inside of the curves of the road, etc, to shave off some distance and keep up with my aunt. I stayed around 100m behind her the entire time.

At the 4 mile mark, so I owed it to myself to put all my effort in this last mile and do it.

.25 miles left and I speed up a little bit

100m left, and it feels effortless. I finish the race.

My time, was **50 minutes 35 seconds.** I was so happy! I can't explain what an amazing feeling it was to do that at that time. I probably wasn't even in the top half, but I did it, and I didn't quit. I exceeded my own goals and expectations, and I smiled for the rest of the day knowing that.

It's unreal to think that 1 month ago I was smoking half a pack a day and was starting week one thinking ""I'll never be able to do week 2""

I am officially a graduate of c25k

Just some tips I'll throw out there:

-I've noticed that running in the morning on an empty stomach

-Drinking a lot of water helps a lot! I finished a whole gallon before the race knowing that I needed it if I had a chance. The Amino X might have done something

-I've heard someone say if you can run a half marathon, and I did it today by running 3x a week, sometimes more.

However I wasn't going to let any of this stop me.  I made it to the school at 9:00 and started jogging.  Everything from there was a blur... I just remember saying to myself breathe properly

I just want to say that this program has definitely worked for me so far.  No repeat days yet... I'm not saying that they're not going to happen just they haven't happened yet.  I'm 32 and even though I'm 282 pounds (as of this morning) I'm in the best shape of my adult life.  I made a promise to myself that I'm going to be able to be an active participant in my son's life.  I've lost weight (diet too) and gained some muscle and a ton of endurance.  When I started this program I was barely completing the 60 second runs.  Now

I also used endomondo to track distance and speed and I was surprised at the results.  I ran a 7m:13s 1 km and a 12m:02s 1 mile. While I'm no speed demon,False,self,t5_2rgoq,False,,medal,t3_ybfow

It was not easy on some days

* Don't expect anything for your performance except finishing.  That's good enough.  The program challenges you different ways with each day

* Trust the program.  It works.  If you finished W2D2, walk.  You're going to make it, just stop trying to outthink the agenda.

* Don't stress yourself out by checking out future runs.  Here's all you have to know: you're going to start by running 90 second intervals

* Do

* Get music to pump you up.  It's functional; it serves a purpose.  It may not be the kind of music you otherwise like to listen to.  No one should ever judge you for what's on your workout playlist.  If Kylie Minogue gets you moving, no-accomplishment-having, Cheetoh-eating haters right in their stupid faces.

* There is a fraternity of runners.  I know our hobby is a solitary one, what they are trying to accomplish, and what brought them to running.  At the very least the ""runner's nod,"" or a wave, a smile, or maybe even a generic word of encouragement.  I've been running through my neighborhood for a few months now and I know for sure that I've inspired a few people to get moving.  It's awesome to be able to show them that they make me feel the same way.

* You will go through a lot, you would have already been running 5k.)  It will be very hard to explain it to others who have not done something like this.  Take the time to connect with other runners, even if just here on Reddit.

So now the time comes to actually start looking into 5K runs.  I'm not planning on doing anything fancy - no mud runs or trail runs or anything like that to start with.  Just show up, if anyone has any leads or tips to send me via PM.  In the meantime, I am going to run Week 9 over and over again every week until I have an event.

Today I planned to do W5D2 but the 8r, especially before W5D3. Because I didn't want to keep him down with my walking I decided to skip day 2 and go for 20 minutes straight.

I expected the run to be incredibly hard

My goal was 20 minutes

I lost track of time as I didn't check my phone

And the best thing was that I didn't even feel like I had to stop. After a few minutes cooldown I felt great and my legs still feel great. This comes from the guy who did W1D1 on the 8th of January this year and almost puked during my 1 minute intervals because I barely could finish them.

C25K really works! Some people might have to repeat a few workouts

The only question is now

* Go SLOW
* Don't overdo it. You do not need to run every day. Let your body rest. 
* Don't give up if you have a bad day. I had to run on a treadmill for one of my W3 runs (business trip in a slightly dangerous city)
* If you have an injury

I'm older than average, male. I've never been very fit before, overweight nearly all my life, but things were getting worse for quite a few years now. So I decided to do something about it. I'm not quite sure how I found out about C25K, somewhere online, I guess, but I'd read about it and it seemed like a good idea, repeated some runs several times but all in all it went better than I expected. My resting heart rate is better

My tips for all you newcomers:

-Slow down. Seriously

-Buy new wick-away t-shirts. Even the cheap ones work wonders.

-The sweat. It doesn't stop

-Motivation is key. Share your progress with your SO or with a friend or with /r/C25K

-Stick with the plan, is not the end of the world and should not be an excuse to quit.

Let me tell you a bit about myself. 5 years ago when I was 24 I was told I had arthritis in my hip (from an accident), so off to the physio I was sent. Luckily for me I had returned to university and got in to be seen at the University's physio school. A lecturer and 3 students worked me over and found a muscle in my lower back was actually pushing down on a nerve that lead to my hip causing the pain. 4 weeks of physio and the problem was all fixed. 

For the last 5 years I'd used my hip as an excuse to not do as much exercise as I should

About 2 minutes in the doubt already started creeping in.  My nose was a bit clogged so it felt like I was already laboring.  But I pushed through.  I had a podcast on of a local morning radio show.  I figured if I listened to music I'd try to count how much time has passed by estimating song time.  So senseless humor would be a good distraction.

It worked.  The next thing I new I got a notification that I was half-way through the run and I was feeling pretty good.  I slowed my pace just a bit so I wouldn't run out of gas.  

Curiosity caught the best of me so I snuck at glance at my phone and saw I only had about 25 seconds left.  Holy crap I thought.  I did it!  Then I was done and I thought I could keep going...for about 5 seconds!  I was dead.  So I walked home during the cool down and sat on my porch to relax.

My head was pouring sweat like a faucet.  My arms and legs were glistening with sweat.  It looked like someone oiled me up or something.  I stood up after a few minutes and there was a sweat outline of my ass on the porch.

1373397472.0,1hyck3,You can probably run way further than you think,HansardBlues,63,5,15,"I have been running for two years. Started out not being able to finish a 2.5km

a) Your route really, is flat, is even and doesn't have a bunch of other joggers running super fast, making you feel like a slow loser (don't worry, you will be passing them soon enough). Seawalls, park trails etc. are the best for this. The idea is to remove unnecessary discomforts (social, spacial

b) If you aren't advancing your mileage fast enough, and don't pay attention to your pacing, It will feel like you are barely moving faster than walking, but you are probably only going a 10-20secs/km slower than you were before. Keep slowing it down until you are hitting the distance you want to be hitting. Probably the biggest beginner problem I see is people running way too fast, and blowing their energy by the 1.5-3km mark.

c) Your diet is the biggest factor holding you back. Stop consuming rice, refined sugars etc. Read something like the 4 hour body, and stick to a good, modern diet.  You do not need to carbo load for anything below a 12-15km run. Your body has plenty of glucose available for you to draw upon for instense physical activity. A 5km run is not an excuse to go eat a plate of pasta and bread sticks.

d) Trying ditching your running partner. Running is a personal thing, they are screwing up your pacing.  If they are running too fast, they are preventing you from going further. If they are running too slow, they are preventing you from increasing your cardio capacity. Find the time, place and speed that works for you.

e) A lot of people will tell you otherwise

f) The distance limitations are usually in your head. Whenever I have had a breakthrough in distance, or talk radio is key to your run. Distract your brain, and you will run further, and faster than you ever imagined possible.

I have always been overweight/obese and I donât think I was able to run a mile when I was in school without walking at some point.

At the beginning of March I was 272 lbs/123 kg.  I spent that month doing a lot of walking 6 days a week (W1-2: 2 miles

I used the RunDouble Android app.  I wasnât able to do a full 5k on Thursday (my W9D3) so I changed the app to distance-based and ran it in 38:44 this morning. I am obviously not a speed demon but hey

I didn't take 2 days off in a row and I have been doing the 100 push ups &amp; 200 sit ups programs on my off days.  My progress with those is slow but I get a little better each time.  

I think I will continue to run a 5k every other day for a month and see what improvements I can make on my time.  After that I'll keep doing what I'm doing or possibly start Bridge to 10K.

I am also 77 days free from cigarettes (13 year habit)!

9 weeks later and I can't believe I've reached the end of the flair list. What a great programme this has been. I never thought I'd be able to easily run 5k in just over 2 months.

Here are a few tips I copied from c25k redditor graduates that might be prove helpful for those of you that are thinking of starting or have just started.

1) **NHS Podcasts:** The first 4-5 weeks I found the [NHS Podcasts](http://www.nhs.uk/Tools/Pages/couch-5K-running-plan.aspx) to be really helpful. These podcasts allowed me to focus on my running and didn't get me stuck keeping track of my time and distance. Especially during the first three weeks this proved to be a great thing. Laura - the podcast's host - did an excellent job keeping me motivated and her music selection wasn't half that bad (it got old after week 4). Once I hit week 5, etc. This made those longer runs go by in no time and helped me run beyond the 30min in week 9.

2) **Visual C25K Plan:** I printed out [c25k visual plan](http://tombenninger.com/files/2011/09/VisualC25K.v1_0b.png) and hung it up in my office. I could check off a day whenever I completed a run and it got a few of my colleagues at work interested.

3) **Runkeeper:** Another fun thing that kept me going - *Runkeeper* - a free iOS app that tracked distance

4) **Sharing:** I was a bit sceptical about this

5) **The c25k Subreddit forums**: Updating my flair and checking the forum was the most rewarding for me. Reading all the progress reports

To all of you noob runners like me - stick to it! It really pays off. I feel 10 years younger and have lost about 5lbs without making huge cutbacks on my food intake. All in all it's been the only fitness programme that has worked this well for me. I'm officially off the couch!

So once again - THANK YOU REDDIT! I can't wait to get started on 'Bridge to 10k'. I'll be running my first official 10k race in 4 weeks. Will check in on this forum from time to time. Until then - happy running Reddit!

For anyone that it might help

The first mile SUCKS!  That really is the hardest part.  Even top runners will tell you the mile is the toughest hurdle.  I have read somewhere a common complaint is ""I just got to a mile but I can't go any farther"" but everyone responds ""yes you can

Just gut it out for two more minutes, at that point, I was in a zone and just kept going.

Pacing:  It has been said 1000 times on here

Get outside and off the treadmill!  I tried running on the treadmill for months.  I heard it was easier than running outside.  Maybe that is true for some or most people

Its easier to quit on a treadmill than it is outside.  You can just kinda stop whenever you feel like it and get off when on a treadmill.  Outside

I've been doing this program since last August.  Yes, I repeated days, I sometimes only ran once a week...

And I hated myself for that.  I hated that I couldn't just stick to the program.  What could be simpler than just run and walk when the lady tells you, overwhelmed with school, and I'd stop.

But I always started again.  I always started.  And despite those months of interim

The other day I was walking my dog.  About 15 minutes in, and from 15 minutes of listening to my workout playlist.

So, walked for about 10, and ran another 5 or so minutes.

Words couldn't express my joy- and relief- that I hadn't lost that progress after about a two month break.  Not to mention the fact that I ran farther than I ever had- even when I was completely on track, to slowly whittle away at that 10 minute walk, a minute at a time.

Which brings us to today.  Got my sneakers on, and water bottle.  I ran and ran.  Soon enough, I was halfway.  Then I was at the point that I had stopped two days ago.  I flew by it.  Pretty soon, I was chanting to myself, ""Okay, we'll stop at the stop sign... stop sign... stop sign.... Alright, then, that mailbox... mailbox... mailbox..."".  The landmarks kept flying past.  Well

Then- bam- I look down at my iPod- five minutes left.  I'm thinking about the dread I felt in elementary school when we were made to see how fast we could run a mile.  Then in middle and high school when we had to run back and forth across the gym and see how long we lasted.  I start imagining my brother's face when I would tell him how far I ran, I was running a 5K, then a marathon, then in the Olympics.  Then, my music got quiet, and I heard the most beautiful words on planet Earth...

My weight loss journey started at ~320lb (145kg) pounds.  Right now I am under 250 lb(113kg)

Story Time!
A couple months ago I wanted to give running a chance.  I could do the stationary bike but it was getting boring.  One of my friends lost about 100 pounds in the last year, and ârunningâ socks.  I am so glad I did!

The first few weeks went OK.  I was getting winded, eating too soon before running, etc.  Nothing major, just cramps that resulted in failed runs.  But thanks to you guys, and /r/loseit I learned so much about running.

I had a huge mental block getting to W5D3, âfuck itâ at the last second and decided to try W5D3.  I slowed down a bit, and I did 44 minutes.  After that I knew the rest of the plan would be easy sauce.

Right after I finished week 8 though, but all I had to do was take a couple extra days off, and I was fine.  I am glad I did not try to run through the pain, because I am sure I would have done some terrible damage to myself.

But really

I started Late November 2011. January 13 2012

I'm planning to continue running 3x per week

I've lost weight in fat and put it back on in muscle. I still have a little flab here and there

When I say 'total transformation' I mean a bit of my appearance

Before I started, had to squeeze into my clothes, my face broke out a lot, and I felt shitty and tired all the time. I suffered from depression and anxiety, and had severe self-esteem issues.

Now, my skin is radiant and clear most of the time, and I wake up with energy ready to burn.
I do Zumba on mondays, friday and sunday, and do the Jillian Michaels Killer Buns &amp; Thighs dvd most thursdays. While my depression isn't ""cured"" (and never will be) the symptoms are essentially gone. I feel confident and proud of myself, and can talk myself out of a lot of my mental attempts at self-defeat.

Everything is different. I don't feel like I just completed a crash course in ""don't be a fatty 101"" and now I'm going to go back to my old life. I feel like an entirely new person, and this concept I'm committing my life to has changed me in honest and lasting ways, unlike an external lifestyle change that depends on a commitment to others.

5 times around the lake with the 3 hills I call small, ever thought it would be something I could do.  Iâve actually been holding off for weeks running 4.75 miles because of the mental block I had.

1341114557.0,vv61v,"First official 5k done tonight!!!! (Lengthy text, hopefully inspirational for those in the program)",mhensh01,55,2,http://www.reddit.com/r/C25K/comments/vv61v/first_official_5k_done_tonight_lengthy_text/, I spent a week in the hospital with a couple of surgeries under my belt that are better not rehashed here. I thought I may share some of the reasons for why I decided to start the c25k

I have looked at this kind of program in the past, I was determined to do something though about my health, and general state of fitness. I was satisfied with the results of some of my dietary changes, but knew I had to do more. The final straw was volunteering at a marathon at a hydration station. I was pretty miserable that morning, and felt the usual isolation that I feel most of the time here. My shift included the majority of the 5k runners, and I was surprised that many people who seemed in worse shape than I felt were chugging along, not lagging behind everyone. I went home that night, my town was having a 5k race on the last day of June-9 weeks to train. I decided

One thing that is always suggested is to consult a physician before starting a new physical fitness routine. I did not and I probably should have.
To re-iterate, I truly had NO running ability.

Day 1 was brutal. I was exhausted, and they felt like they were on fire after 30 minutes.

But I fought on

As the weeks went on, I broke my toe. And I lost my Mp3 player (fortunately I have a backup). This pushed me into the red, and the day I broke my toe, I went out and blew day one of week 4 out of the water. With a broken toe. Simply stunned was my feeling when I got back to my apartment.

I mostly did my runs in the evening. I did try the morning a couple of times, so I may transition to mornings over the summer.

The first time I ran for 25 minutes straight, when I only was needing to run 25 minutes, I ran 30 minutes (which is the week 9 runs). Then I ran 40 minutes. Then 45. Now the last couple nights I have run the entire 3.1 miles in about 49 minutes. I had been running only for time, not necessarily for distance.


The day of the race.

I spent most of the day in the house, hot, and breezeless. Then the sun came out 10 minutes before the race time. At 6:55, it felt like 92 degrees out, and with no wind at all it was quite brutal, among the most brutal conditions I have trained in thus far. The pistol fired, Dr. John's ""Getaway"" started, I kept my pace, and crossed the finish line at 45:38. I think. My mind was not quite registering what was happening. It might have been 46:38. My time will be posted online shortly. I was handed a cold bottle of water and a cold wet rag which I put on my head. I DID IT.


So what have I learned and what is next? Because it does not end with this 5k. My new goal is to either run another 5k this fall under 40 minutes

1.âDo What Thou Wilt Shall Be The Whole of The Lawâ-Crowley

If you really have the will to do something, and most of all the voice of âCanâtâ in my head, none of them stopped me. More telling, this was mostly done by my will, not someone else prescribing it.

2. âYour Anger Is A Giftâ-Rage Against The Machine

This song (""Freedom"") wasnât in my playlist, made worse since getting laid off a year and a half ago. Iâve struggled to find productive ways to express this for years though, especially having to keep it bottled up at work. I donât know if my anger comes across in conversation or when I write, but believe me it is right there on the back burner. Finally, running has given me a great way to express this feeling. More than just raging along with a metal song, and more than even going to a live metal show, every meter I run is viscerally pushing the negative energy through my muscles and feet. Itâs hard to explain in words. I am sure that I am an equally hilarious and frightening sight in the last few minutes of my runs as I yell at myself and use up all of my cussing for the day. Running alongside others will be an interesting experiment in restraint, I was lucky to communicate with the guy who took my picture how to take my picture.


3. Battles will be lost

I am not proud of the times I had to repeat, it was my best time completed, and I am sure adrenaline had a lot to do with that.

4. You are only accountable to yourself

I even hesitated telling anyone about this, I think around the second week, I did start talking with my parents about doing this. I then shared it with my boss (who himself runs every morning before work), eventually several people at work knew and were cheering me on. A few others friends knew too and were super supportive. There was also the faceless yet ever-present support of reddit.com/r/c25k where I posted my progress and got encouragement and motivation from others who only know me as a handle.

I have not cheated once.  I have followed every step of the program.  I have successfully completed every day.  But, believe you me).  What this means for me is that I've needed a relatively slow pace in order to complete the weekly intervals because when I increase my pace too much, it feels like my heart and lungs redline like a car stuck in 2nd gear.  

I have read plenty on /r/running and /r/c25k to know that a slow pace is just fine when a beginner.  And even after 8 weeks of C25K

So here is my query for all of you.  I am currently at about 1.75 miles for 28 minute interval.  And believe me, not burning out halfway through.  Heart rate wise, this is about as fast as I'm willing to safely go right now.  Which means my 30 minute pace will not be near a 5K distance.  So, after I finish week 9, should I just keep repeating week 9 until I get a 5k in 30 minutes, or should I keep my same turtle pace and try and increase my interval times?

Either way


Edit:  Thanks for the suggestions and encouragement everybody.  We'll see where I'm at in two weeks.  I think I'll probably do week 9 for a couple weeks, running form, etc.  I imagine that will create a little extra efficiency as well.

So here are my thoughts and reflections for all of you still plugging away:

* I started listening to audiobooks around week 7 of the program and it totally changed the game for me. It feels like you've got a running buddy with you (I'm listening to Bossypants by Tina Fey right now and I find myself laughing out loud at points) and it's just distracting enough. I used to listen to music
* DO NOT look at the clock. Just don't do it. It makes everything worse.
* If you feel like you can keep going past the time you're supposed to run
* Be careful what you eat before you run. I made the mistake of consuming bean dip an hour before a run during Week 6 -- never again.
* **Keep going.** When you want to stop
* You won't always want to run. Sometimes, I was *always* happy that I'd done it once I was done. So just do it. It feels awesome.
* Reward yourself! Not with junk food (preferably)
* And finally -- don't be self-conscious. I used to be afraid to run outside where people could see me. I was afraid they'd judge me when I'd stop to walk

1314648438.0,jyac4,Recently finished C25K. I have 2 tips for the beginners.,fry36,55,7,17,"I started the program about 2 months ago, here are 2 things that really helped me with this program:

Don't look at the time! I know it's tempting to glance at how much longer you have to pant and sweat, but no matter what you do, don't count down the seconds! Once you finally hear that ""beep"" or realize you're almost done with an album and you have like 10 seconds left, you'll realize you didn't give your brain that chance to turn back on you with the overly dramatic bullshit. You won't think of stopping early if you don't look at the clock early.

Don't underestimate your gains! If you're a few weeks into the program, just remember that a few weeks ago, you could barely run for a minute straight. When you see that there are people out there quadrupling your longest runs without breaking a sweat, just remember...you're doing the same to your max week after week! There should be nothing stopping you from saying ""I'm doing fucking awesome.""

A little more than a year ago, even though I never joined in the conversation, I gained much encouragement from this group.  

I found it to be motivational to come here and read your stories before I went out to complete whatever day of whatever week I was on.  It really helped to read posts from those who were weeks ahead of where I was so I was better prepared for what my body was going to complain about.

I originally started C25K because I realized my endurance wasn't what it should be during a martial arts class (I'm a higher-ranking student in this class and found myself getting out of breath far too easy...to the point of it being embarrassing).  After doing some research

The first day, and stayed there for half an hour trying to recover.  It was not pretty.  The second day was similar.  But it got better--it got better a lot faster than I would have thought, too.  By the start of the second week I was no longer hitting the floor at the end of the workout.  Day 3 of Week 5 was a big confidence booster.  By the time Week 7 rolled around, I had found that I enjoyed running (or at least the feeling you have after finishing a run...you know, where you've pushed your body to new limits and survived).

Anyway

I'll also add that when I started I was 266 pounds.  I've lost a good chunk of that and it has definitely improved the running experience.  So

Picking up running again has really (and as corny as it sounds) really helped saved me. I went through a bad breakup around this past Christmas and needed to find something to distract me from it. I got back into running in March and then found C25K in May and didn't start it until the end of August. It took me around 11 weeks to run this but I finished it &amp; feel amazing. I picked running back up for me &amp; couldn't be more proud of myself for sticking with it &amp; amazed at the fact that I have watched my body change from not being able to run a mile straight to being able to run 2 miles straight without stopping.

Hereâs my story (to pay back those who inspired me):

Iâm 43, but battled weight much of my life. Iâve hovered around 300 for about the last 7 years. Tried several diets, but haven't kept weight off. Considered surgery, but after spending a lot of time on r/c25k, r/fitness, r/weightroom, r/loseit, I could too. 

So, weights, etc. I also started watching what I ate, but didn't get crazy with every calorie. Lost 15 lbs pretty quickly, but more importantly, I felt great. On 9/1 I got serious and started planning my workouts and diet better. I kept doing a good mix of cardio and lifting. 

On Thanksgiving I started C25K, I followed the program religiously and my body just kept adapting! I had no failures in 9 weeks, but even if I had, it wouldnât have been a big deal.  I wouldâve just repeated and keep pushing along. I feel like I could probably run a 10k today if I really wanted to, but thatâs for another time. Iâm progressing carefully.

Iâve now lost 40 lbs, Iâve relearned an old lesson. The only way I can manage my calories is to exercise and be fit. When Iâm sedentary, Iâm hungry all the time and crave junk food out of boredom, stress, whatever. But when Iâm fit and healthy, I crave real food/fuel, and not every second. Diet just doesnât seem like a big deal when fitness is part of my lifestyle. It's a journey

Keep going! You can do this!!

* Proper running shoes really do help. You don't need any of the other fancy gear (I ran with old cotton tops and socks for the first 8 weeks), but I found myself developing shin splints at the end of my runs. So I went to a running store near me, got fitted for shoes, and have had no problems with my shins since.

* You should record your progress. I use Runkeeper on my smartphone, and pace, so I can obsess over my stats afterwards. It also records your personal records, goals, and plenty other stats. Plus it's free! ^other ^apps ^are ^available.

* Try not to get to over-do it, I'm going to run again tomorrow, I love running!"", which is good, but you run the risk of injuring yourself, and injury sucks. It's much better to take the rest days than to have to stay inside injured for a week or two. Also, slow down if you need to. My speed gradually decreased throughout the program

* Don't worry about breathing technique, and you probably need to slow down.

* No matter how much I've dreaded a run, and regretted going. You'll hear that a lot anyway, it's the second most repeated thing in this subreddit.

* Running should be fun (most of the time). Don't forget that!",self,t5_2rgoq,1358266160.0,,done,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/C25K/comments/16metz/finished_c25k_heres_some_advice_for_people/

A few minutes after I hung up

Because I hate giving my word and backing out, this would be just beyond what I should be capable of. I figured I'd just use the remaining distance as a warm down walk. In my mind this would still be me continuing the c25k idea of pushing yourself a bit further each time and also still getting the feeling of completing something I agreed to. 

Got to the start line this morning

Eventually, that's how I felt). At this point, the nature of the mental battle shifted to restraining my ego. Never mind that I was already punching above my weight by the fact of entering a 5k, my ego was making a pretty credible argument that I should NOT be allowing everybody to be running ahead of me. Thankfully, by the end of the 2nd km, I managed to subdue that voice and started focusing on the basics. For me, that was: move one leg -- move the other leg --  don't stop.

By the time I got to the 3km my body was pretty much spent and I was running on very little. For some reason

Eventually I mosied past the 4km mark. 

I must say

Before I knew it

I can't explain how overjoyed I am that I did it. I haven't received the official time as yet but when I checked my watch it read 29 minutes and i never checked it until a good minute+ after the race ended so I'm guessing I actually did the run in about 28 minutes~. 

I think today helped me to more deeply appreciate one of the spin-off effects of doing a c25k programme. In addition to teaching your body durability, which would have otherwise probably caused me to give up.

Now, I just kept running without moving forward (sorry, not an english speaker. I'm sure there's a better word for that.) 

So that woman turns to look at me and she starts shaking her head and laughing. Then she looks at me again

I felt angry and embarassed. Why would someone do that? I mean, like someone who's only started running a few weeks ago. Maybe a little uncoordinated or something. Also, I limp a little in the beginning, because my left knee has been hurting lately for  the first mile or so. After a while, it always gets better.

1.  You will only lose weight if you track your calories and eat less than you use.  It's pretty simple.  I am NOT doing that at the moment (I'm eating like crap, despite exercising five days a week.  (I'm going to start eating better in  January for a Biggest Loser competition with a $1,000 prize I have a pretty legit chance of winning.)

2.  HOWEVER:  My legs!  I am getting pretty legs again!  My calves are defined, whereas before it was all just squish.  Basically:  Who cares if you lose weight or not?  Your body will be better because of it.

3.  I am moving freer - I don't know how else to put it.  I just walk easier, even if I haven't dropped a pound.

4.  Rheumatoid Arthritis - This won't apply to many people, hopefully)  holy crap - the running is actually HELPING.  I can just feel... I dunno.  Like the fluid is less stagnate?    

Basically - I am pushing through the pain and stiffness, rather than more, as you might expect.  On days I am flaring hard, I run anyways, and I have not regretted it yet.  The first half of the run sucks pretty bad, but by the end of the run my body is moving freer, kind of like how it feels after a hot shower.  I figured I had nothing to lose by trying this program

I had a blast running my first race

After talking with some runners from work I decided to try and build a base of around 15-20 MPW, and a long run on the weekend. The farthest I have made it is 5 miles. My wife has been kicking my butt on distance, and She ran 7 miles last week ""just to see if she could do it"". She has not had a chance to enter a race yet due to work, but I hope to find one we can do together soon. That leads Me to My second official race.

Yesterday Aug 3 I ran My second 5K race. The race started at 8:00 a.m., overcast and cool. This race was a little different, and had pace setter volunteers who held pace times on cards the whole race. This makes it really nice to get an idea of where to line up at the start, and to keep from going out to fast. the race started, and I tried to keep the 10 min pace runner in sight. It started out flat on a paved road, but quickly hit the trail, and the hills started. There are no hills in my town, but I never stopped running. I finished with a time of 30:40

I couldn't understand why Week 5 was set up the way it was until just now - after finishing day 2 of it. It's to help you figure out how to get past the 'breath wall'. :D

I'm positive I'm not alone in there being this section of your run where you suddenly feel like you're unable to do anything but shallow breathe and you're not getting enough air to your lungs to keep going. While I'm sure a good amount of this is the mental battle

Today, it breaks down that wall instantly, and I can breathe normally again... and no matter how many times someone tells you about it, you don't learn it for yourself until you're there.

1) PACE YOURSELF. I know I'm beating a dead horse

2) Pick some great music - build a running playlist

3) It's okay to take a day or two off, but I wasn't ready, especially at the beginning of the program. Ended feeling burned out, tired, sore, and unhappy all the time. Started alternating strength/cardio days, and I've found I perform better after days off. 

4) If possible, who is annoyingly athletic. :) In any case, running with someone keeps you accountable - on days where I felt lazy or didn't want to run, I would remember that I couldn't leave my roommate hanging, so I'd head out!

5) And finally, or ""I don't have enough time for this""), just run. JUST GO. Just start. And if in 5 or 10 minutes you still feel crappy, then stop. But I found that once I started, I was good to go for the whole 30 minutes. And remember - it is just 30 minutes!

I spent 10 years of my life believing I couldn't run. As a kid, dance classes, swimming, you name it. However, somewhere along the way, I lost track of that girl and gained a whole bunch of weight through my stressful years of middle/high school. In middle school, I decided I would join athletics and I stuck with it the entire year. However, âexercise inducedââ¦I thought it was ridiculous when the doctors told me, for an entire year

Fast forward, knowing I could stop if I couldn't breathe. And now, here I am, 9 weeks later. My 5k takes around 38 minutes. I can jog for 70 minutes (5 miles) â slower than the average bear maybe, but I donât care. Because now I know that those coaches were wrong. I donât know if they didn't care or they didn't know what they were doing to me, but now I enjoy running. I go trail running and love that I feel like I can go forever (for a while at least). My lungs donât feel like they shut down on me. 

So in short, 30 since I started trying to lose weight) and still going. I am still substantially overweight, but it doesn't matter. Iâm still working at it, and I did it. The biggest barrier for me was/is trying to correct 10 years of beliefs. Believe you can do it. Slow and steady win the race. All of these are clichÃ©, I realize, but they are oh so true. Why else would they be said so much?

But tonight I decided I was through. It was an unseasonably warm day today and I said ""after work

I bought the official C25k Android app a while ago. I loaded up the regimen and went after it. I'm lucky that I live within 5 minutes of the outdoor track at the college here. I was able to run it tonight. I got in 2.3 miles. I didn't get winded. I'm a little sweaty. And I actually started smiling at the halfway point.

I think I'm actually looking forward to completing this program. 


My story: I've always bee pretty sedentary. But skinny my entire life. These past three or four months I've packed on about 10 to 15 pounds. That doesn't seem like a lot, and my stomach is now much more rotund than it ever should be.

I've been doing much less eating fast food and now I'm going to start doing the exercise I need to actually help me shed some of this weight and get in shape.

I'm posting here so I can have some accountability for myself. I have the reddit community here for more motivation

1353583248.0,13m7qb,Thoughts (mostly ramblings) from someone who has recently finished.,steste,43,5,10,"So as some of you may have read I recently reached week 7 and found myself able to run 5k.  Since this day last week I have ran 4 5K runs with a personal best so far of 28mins 35 seconds (I would have beaten that his morning if it wasnt for having to navigate flooded paths!)

So like everyone else I'd like to share a few things I have picked up along the way.  Everybody is different.  The comments below are mainly directed at myself but hopefully they may be of use to someone.

1. **Slow Down** Yes everyone says it but its without a doubt the best advice for anyone starting to run.  I have lost count the number of times I have decided running was going to be my regular exercise but I just couldn't do it.  I was always going too fast.  Slow it right down.  It may seem like you are hardly running at all but even a shuffle is enough when you are starting.  Think you cant make it to the end of that interval? DONT STOP! Just slow down and you will make it!

1. **Hydration** Some of my toughest runs were

1. **Rest** Rest days are there for a reason.  If you havent done much exercise before starting this program your body needs time in-between each run to recover.  Even if you have been a regular exerciser chances are you are using different muscles.  I learned this one the hard way and started running on rest days.  Was out for almost 3 weeks with a foot injury.

1.  **Its all in your head**.  You can do this. Your legs aren't about to fall if you dont stop right now.  Your lungs are not going to explode.  So much time during my runs is spent arguing with myself.  My head is saying stop but I know I can do it.  Its a mind game.  You've already won the first battle with your head by getting out there and doing it.  Dont let it win once you are out there.  Keep things slow and steady and you will win. 

1. **Dont look outside!** As I said I'm an early morning runner.  I get out of bed and head straight out there.  If I look outside and see horrendous weather its so much harder to force myself out.  I now make sure that the first time I see what the weather is like is after I'm all ready to go in my running gear and I open that door to start the run!  Obviously this one only works if you run first thing in the morning!

1. **No excuses**.  So its raining outside. Or a bit cold. Or you had a late night and are kind of tired.  You're going to get all wet and sweaty anyway.  You'll warm out once you are out there.  The run will wake you up!  So often our reasons for missing a run are just simple excuses.  This is linked to point 4.  Stop making excuses and get your ass out there.  You made this decision to change your life and start this plan.   Dont let the lazy version of you win. 

1. **Clothing**  You dont need fancy gear to get out there and run. That old pair of shorts and Tshirt you have will do just nicely.  You can pick up a half decent pair of running trainers for not a lot of money. DOnt be swayed by the big brands.  I did buy new trainers but they were only Â£40.  The only other things I have bought are a arm strap for my phone and a couple of base layer tshirts as its getting a bit cold.  None of this is expensive.

1.  **Its ok to fail**  So you just had to stop during a running interval.  You are such a failure right? You can never complete anything you set out to do right?  Bullshit!! you are out there running.  You have already succeeded in changing who you are.  The fact you failed an interval or a run shows you are pushing yourself.  Take pride in the fact you are out there trying.  Give it a day or two

1. **/r/c25k**  This place - use it.  It was this subreddit that inspired me to get out there and try this program. It was here I came to for advice,,False,self,t5_2rgoq,1353583455.0,,True

W6D3 is 25 minutes, just you and your feet moving to the pace of your music or the road or the wind.

Nothing to distract you, and running, and running, and you look back.

You look back to the time when you thought your first 3 minute run was hard and now the last three minutes seem to be the hardest.

You look to the future and see yourself running not 25 minutes but 2.5 hours

You become greedy, your child's school bill, the repair for your car. You only think about the finish line.

Please use the sidebar! It is very helpful.

&gt;When everyone first starts running they worry about going as fast as they can.

DO NOT DO THIS.


&gt;Run

You'll be able to run fast

In order to run fast

qwertyrific

&gt;Along the lines of going slowly, or for however long it takes you to run 2 miles.

&gt;Drink plenty of water


&gt;W1 is a bitch

W4 is hard

&gt;Buy running socks

Go get your feet analyzed

You can get analyzed for three different gaits, and supinator. 

Also when you're paying $100+ for sneakers

Running shoe brands include Nike, Saucony, Mizuno, New Balance and others.

!!! Most people's feet are two different sizes! A good running store

&gt;Run three days a week

Also eat food! As you run

Bananas, cookies, and butter are not.

&gt;Register yourself for a 5K two months after you start. You'll pay ~$35 to run

&gt;For summer runners:
Run in the morning or the evenings! I highly recommend NOT running in the hours between 11AM-3PM
although [this article in the NYTimes](http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/11/03/phys-ed-will-training-in-the-heat-improve-your-performance/) says that heat training can improve your runner from 4-8%.

Don't wear cotton

&gt;For winter runners:

Late morning to early afternoon might be the best. You might be working during those hours and probably only run before or after. If it's too cold


julieannie
&gt;For the ladies- invest in support. My local shoe store had free bra fittings and they were able to help me with even an odd size. Reducing back strain helped my posture which helped me run without back pain.

Then as soon as my timer hit 28mins, ""NO. THIS FUCKING ENDS NOW, BITCH! LET'S DO THIS!!! O_O"" 
I swear I think for the first time I got a true taste of the ""runners high"" cause suddenly I felt myself going faster, but my body kept going for another min or so until I felt like my heart was gonna explode.... then I stopped. Lol

I felt amazing. Afterward I felt like screaming to the hills ""ANYTHING IS POSSIBLLLLEEE!!!!"" Hahaha.

I still can't believe it. At the end I may have been slow as hell (still technically didn't run the whole 5k) but fuck it! I am basking in the moment that just a few months ago I was chain smoking, most of my life I hated even the THOUGHT of running for any extended period of time.

I wanna thank everyone on this forum for all the consistent advice and inspiration!!

For those thinking about starting it: DO IT. It's life changing.
For those just starting: KEEP GOING. You will surprise yourself.
For those near/at the peak of it: NEVER QUIT. You're stronger than you think.
For those who finished: RESPECT. This shit was not easy.

I got fired on Tuesday and I really wasn't expecting it.

I also hadn't ran in two or three weeks.

Since I had copious amounts of free time now I decided that I'd go for a morning run and I'd pick up right where I left off. Normally I run without music or anything but the sound of my own panting and breathing and I figured that it would be a good way to clear my head.

I was wrong... sort of.

It started at the end of the second three-minute run; my manager

""... productivity issues...""

""... not as professional as...""

""... going in another direction...""

Over and over and over again. The chime rang and I started walking

""... productivity issues...""

""... not as professional as...""

""... going in another direction...""

I slowed up just a little but kept moving. In the minute and thirty seconds that passed I heard another voice join the chorus... mine:

""... productivity issues...""

""Fuck it

""... not as professional as...""

""We can pick this up tomorrow.""

""... going in another direction...""

""Got fired

""... going to have to terminate...""

Yeah

""... unprofessional...""

""So... stop now, fill out some apps.""

No.

""... unprofessional...""

Fuck you.

""... going in another direction...""

Fuck you.

""... productivity issues...""

FUCK Yo--

""Begin Running.""

So I did. It sucked. My lungs burned

""Workout complete.""

I was gasping and panting like a dying racehorse (guess I was moving a little faster than I should have been) and ended up almost collapsing into a chain link fence but I did it. I picked up right where I left off and even though I wanted to stop and go back to bed and hide I kept going because I'll be damned if I'm going to let something like the loss of a job keep me down.

For me it feels like a huge victory. I'm mid-30s, and then you only have to run faster than your slowest friend."" I was never a sports player or athlete, have bad knees, and have a special talent for quitting any sort of fitness routine. In fact, if you asked me now why I started running with C25K, I'm not entirely sure I could pinpoint the reason. It sounded like a good idea at the time. And now, I enjoy running!

Things that I learned here that I think helped make me successful are: get decent shoes, and take your rest days. I spent a lot of time worried about how slow I am, but two things I read here really stuck with me. One was the tried-and-true ""it's a marathon, not a sprint"" that I've applied to other things like weight loss, but that was just as true for me and running. The other was (sorry, I forget who said it) that, in terms of pace, and what most people think of as running is sprinting.

This subreddit has been key in my success. Before I began, to not injure myself, and to take it slow and easy through the program. I succeeded on each of those points. I never failed a session, didn't injure myself, and grandma shuffled my way to 30 minutes of sustained jogging.

My reward for finishing 30 minutes was to sign up for a 5k race in a couple months. Now, this year. My goal is to be able to run 5k without walk breaks or death in under 45 minutes. For the next week or two, I'm just going to keep running 30 minutes, and try to get more comfortable with running that length of time. Then I'm going to incorporate one longer run a week to see if I can start going for more distance. I've seen tons of people say here that the speed with come with time spent running, and I think that sounds like a good plan for me.

On my w1d1 I ran for as far as I could(2km) without stopping, minor cramps, *painful side stitches*) but I managed to soldier on. 

What I did to avoid those problems were:

* **Set-up multiple phones to ring at 5:30am** Yes

* **Proper cool down is needed** plus stretching *after* your run to prevent cramps. Stretching before running (for me) would more be more likely to cause injuries. Didn't experience cramps after w2 with these.

* **Exhale while landing on your left** I've looked for several tips on preventing *side stitches* after being plagued with this on w3 and this is the only thing I did and it worked! My breathing pattern is like a 1-2-3-exhale

* **Proper hydration before your run** and avoid loading up on food. I just munch a small piece of bread and drink a cup of water before going out.

* **Try to land on the balls of your feet** not on the heels. Landing on your forefoot will distribute the force to your calf muscles. But if you pound your heel every time you jog
 
I didn't have much of a problem when I did these after w5 so I think if these helped me

I finally reached 5km(33min) by w5d3

I dreaded taking my beagle out because I wasn't able to keep up when he got after rabbits.  I would get out of breath wrangling my pre-k visually impaired students.  Something had to give.

It took several attempts to get through W1D1.  The first few weeks were all hard work.  I got lots of great advice here and from friends who were runners. Throughout the program there have been a million excuses to put off a day or stop in the middle of a workout.  Honestly, I run.

As of today

So what's your excuse for not running today?

**EDIT** So I wasn't saying there's not a reason for skipping a day.  If you're too sick or hurt or there are other things getting in your way

First off

I was hungry when I began my run, so I had to stop and scare them off before continuing. I'm talking bared teeth, hackles up, the whole deal. 

So here I am desperately trying to restrain my dogs, pssting, stomping, and hand gestures later, I feel comfortable enough to move on. So I'm dragging my dogs, only to see the attacking ones still following. One more bark at them and they scattered. I'm so tired of being attacked. 

Territorial dogs need to be tied up

Shortly afterwards I got a cramp

Now I feel like crap and have a fuse that's too short to measure. There's no way I'm taking the dogs with me again. While it was fun these last 3 workouts

I had never imagined the changes a simple spreadsheet telling me how long I should run on a giving day could make. Those 3 days a week, I remember all the struggles I had.

Damn did I feel bad about myself. Moving out of your parents house is never easy, alcohol, you name it, the college-life started early for me.  I was never into sports, I fucking hated exercise. But then the point came where I hated myself more for not exercising.

Around September last year I bought a pair of sneakers. Those poor sneakers laid in my room for way too long because I was scared. Scared to start something very easy. This spreadsheet, for some reason.

When I moved to a new apartment in January I decided it was time. On the 8th of January I started day 1 of my journey. I didn't have any fancy running clothes so I pulled on a sweater, but I felt different afterwards. The fact that I kicked a habit felt so great that I looked forward to the next run and low and behold, two days later those same intervals where easier, not much, but just a bit easier. And so I kept on running.

I ran at 6am, rain and freezing cold. Every time I stepped outside my body wanted to go back in, but my mind pushed me to do it. Slowly running became easier, and the struggles I had on the first week where easy on week 4.

I clearly remember W5D3, when I asked him how long I still needed to run he responded that we were running for 30 minutes already, and did 4,5km. That day westopped at 5k, my first one. And damn did I feel good about it. That rush, that feeling, it was fantastic and suddenly all my struggles felt like they were worth it.

I planned my first 5k event and finished it in 28:08. That's where things really changed. That first event. Running between 1000's of other runners, fast runners, slow runners, young runners and old runners. Everybody was friendly and we all ran our own little race. I think that day got me addicted.

Another 5k followed slowly afterwards. I crushed my PR to 25:54 and damn did it feel good. That race was hard

Move forward to today. I'm currently running 4 times a week

Running became part of my lifestyle. I feel restless on the days I can't run. Running clears my mind, if not my entire life.

And all started with this little spreadsheet, definitely. Was it worth it in the end? Hell yeah!

To not completely turn this post into an ego-trip I want to give you guys (and girls) some tips that might help to get you out and change your life for the better too:

* **Gear**

Many companies want to make you believe you need to invest 100's of dollars before you can even get out of the door and I agree

* **Shoes**

Shoes however, you will love them for many miles to come if you buy the right ones. Don't feel scared to go into a running shop because you're too fat, lazy, slow, inexperienced or whatever. Those guys are happy to help and started insecure and inexperienced at some point too. A good shop will have advice for every kind of runner.

* **Pain**

Oh damn the pains. You start out on your run and there it is, but they will seldom really hurt you. Stop however if they get a lot worse during your run or the pain feels like a knife/needle every step you take. If you want to stop every time it hurts a bit you're not going to get far. No pain, no gain! I know it's very scary the first times you feel pain, but sometimes you just have to run through it. Don't overdo it though, sometimes, when it **really** hurts you should just stop, take some extra rest and try again later. Nothing wrong with that!

* **Experiment**

Big thing, maybe it's great. You can ask 1000 runners what they prefer, and all will answer different. Find your own answers. The same is for the questions ""when should I eat"", ""what should I wear"", ""should I drink before a run"" etc. Try new stuff, but not too much at the same time. If you want to know what variable X will do with your run then change it a few times. You will know soon enough what works for you.

* **Speed**

Easy one, speed is for people that can comfortably run 5k, not for starters. I still don't worry about my speed, some runs I feel great and I go faster then others, but I never look at my results afterwards and feel bad because I went ""too slow"". Again, DON'T WORRY ABOUT SPEED, it will improve over time automatically.

* **What will that person think about me?**

It doesn't matter, they all started the same. Those people that look at you while you run? Fuck, you don't even know them why would you care? You feel bad about the fact you don't run, so change it. If somebody yells something stupid at you it will suck, but nothing sucks more then being unhappy about yourself. As soon as you get home after another great accomplishment you will forget those stupid people. (I got yelled at many times in my bad neighborhood but I stopped to give a shit, it's my life and I fucking enjoy it!). For the fat runners I would like to add, those people that judge you for running will also judge you if you're out not running. They are just assholes and you're not going to change that. You can however change your obesity! I dropped 25 pounds in the progress, like my ""pizza-for-breakfast"" roommate

* **But! What if? How should I?**

Got any extra questions? Feel free to ask, I will be happy to help!

1339771927.0,v3ho3,A few days ago I finished my last C25K run. There's a couple of things I want to share.,Azelius,42,5,6,"Wow.

What a long

I still remember that first day in the park, in High school, I was the shunned, ostracized nerdy kid. You can begin to imagine the self-esteem nightmare that those types of experiences cause.

Still, I finished my med school exams. I did not do well. I had to repeat the year. I was dismayed, had to move back in with my mom and left my running shoes at the door.

That was a year ago.

It's been a long year. I was preoccupied with my studies, but that's it.

Until I started my exams in May. Maybe it was the stress

Week two was painful to restart. Those first few weeks were painful. Getting completely winded after running only 4 or 5 minutes. Ideas of inadequacy and not being ""enough"" having at the back of my head. And still, I started looking forward to my runs.

I used to hate getting sweaty and wet. But every day that passed, tired, sweaty and happy. And each day I saw myself running more, better, farther.

The first time I ran 10 minutes I couldn't believe it. Imagine my face when I did the same with 20 minutes. I was elated. How could this scrawny

And eventually I realized. I realized why I loved running. I realized why I never gave up, and athletic young man in his 20's lapping everyone that was staying home on their couches.

And still, more hardships. But when I go out running, it's only me, my songs and the track. Some day's you get big revelations, flashes of truth and motivation while you're out there. But most it's just the silence of feet against pavement and the soundtrack of your choice. Nothing more.

Running won't get rid of your problems. No matter how far you run or how fast, that reminds you just how damn strong you are. Or maybe it's the runners high. Or the knowledge that each week, you can improve, become better. Whatever it may be, the effect is the same. **It reinforces you.**

As for me, for a long time. I plan on entering my first race next month, and I'm sure there'll be many more after that. I look forward to my first half-marathon, my first marathon and many other things. But above all, I look forward to the happiness I know running will bring me.

I write this because I've been meaning to share this for some time, that you may continue until you cross it, and beyond.

TL;DR: **It's worth it.**

Believe me if you are questioning your ability to complete this program just trust in yourself

Here's a little bit about how I got here:

This all started at the beginning of October.  I went to the health center at my uni for a check up, and needless to say I was pretty god damn ashamed of myself.  As is with a lot of us on here,  I was a very active person in high school, and a pretty successful athlete.  I have always been a big kid, but I was in pretty damn good shape when I was involved in sports.  After a few shoulder surgeries, I decided I wasn't going to pursue athletics into college, and that's when the fluff began to accumulate.  Binging, late night pillaging

After the weigh in, and r/keto before I actually started trying to improve my health, so I knew I had a pretty cool pool of information to guide me on my way.  I decided I needed to fix my diet first, so that's when I started some serious portion control, as well as a mostly paleo diet.  It worked well, and I lost about 20 pounds in barely 2 weeks.  I was very excited, but I knew I could do better so I started exercising and a more keto type diet. 

Bring on the c25k!  I was not at all really excited to start this, so I was riding pretty high.  The first few runs I was really pushing my limits, running from 6-8mph at a given time.  Then those lovely 3-5 minute runs rolled around, and I was pretty sure I was bound to fail one here or there.  Through some good music and focus, I was able to get my head in the right place and push through.  I kept telling myself before runs, ""get your mind right"", ""the only thing that can stop me is me"".  This was so crucial to keep things together.  I went on vacation in the middle of the program, but this was by far the biggest hurdle of my journey.  It started out by me not even reading the running plan and assuming it was just like w5d2.  That was the most horrible feeling when I checked my phone and realized I was 5 minutes in to a 20 minute run.  I kept my head up, take an extra rest day. There is no shame in that and your body will perform much better when you eventually run again.  I was lucky enough to be injury free throughout

Last year I first ventured to this subreddit after seeing a loseit post of some fat guy becoming a handsome devil. He adviced C25K as a start for doing cardio and to get in shape. I figured if he could do it

I already had good running shoes and I added to my collection with a bunch of running thights

I started W1D1 and I had near instant spleen cramps. I still blame dehydration for that. 

I fought through the first 2 weeks, I could keep this pace throughout the program.

I followed the time program

I broke down with a knee injury

Yesterday I ran a new record, but according to the sports physician I'm seeing it's nothing to worry about, it's just my knees getting used to longer distances.

During C25K (and Keto-diet at the same time) I dropped 26lbs and I'm officially not overweight anymore

**With this my life changed

After graduation I started a running program in my company and try to organise a biweekly 5K for my employees. Also I'm doing a C25K from start with 2 very much overweight colleagues. It costs me three hours a week

I could keep writing but I doubt people would want to keep reading. I just want to give you all my personal protip:

I started this program 6 weeks ago after a lifetime of no physical activity what so ever. I'm a software engineer, of course, left me with a rotten body weighing in at 117 kg (258 lbs) when I started dieting in January. I'm 178 cm long (5""8') and 31 years old, no time to start undoing a lifetime of bad behavior like the present.

Week 1 was brutal, but I didn't dare look forward and think about what was in store the coming weeks - all though I knew.

Week 3, and I had started getting control over my breath. While still getting horribly exhausted on some of the runs, it now felt like a mental thing more than a physical thing. Things have been going along steadily since then - some ups, some downs, but I've completed every run so far. A few without really getting tired, a few where the last running interval were done on pure willpower getting no help from the rest of my body.

A few days ago I more or less crashed. I woke up almost shaking, and realized that I was eating way too little for my exercise level. I work out 6 days a week now (lifting weights on my off-days from running), and completely empty myself out every day. Yet I was eating roughly the same amount of calories I was eating when I was just dieting without exercising. Yesterday I stuffed my face with food of all sorts just to give my body something to work on (maybe a good idea, maybe a bad idea, I didn't even bother checking it up). It felt like things were starting to kick back into gear yesterday afternoon, but I was very apprehensive about W5D3 coming up today. D2 was such a struggle, and not knowing what my body would feel like once I started using it today

I set off in moderate wind and light rain this morning. Wind blowing in my face, I passed a farm down the road here. I remembered something I hadn't thought of since W1D1; being able to run from home to that farm was going to be a milestone for me. If I could do that some day, and that would be huge. I've ran that distance a couple of times so far in the program, but I didn't remember that goal I set myself until today. It gave me tons of motivation, and I ended up completing my 20 minute run (with a few minutes uphill running at 10 and 15 minutes) feeling like I just got started. I felt so great when Lara in the NHS C25K podcast told me I had finished my run that I just couldn't make myself stop. I took a little detour from my regular route and ran via another neighboring farm (yes, I live in the country side, tons of farms!) all the way home. I threw myself on the grass when I came home and just savored the moment for a little while before doing my 5 minute cooldown walk.

I've always told myself I could do this, and W6D3 can't come fast enough. I forgot to start Endomondo when I started the run today, but based on earlier runs on the same route I'm guessing I came in at around 4.2 km distance-wise today, where 3.5+km was from running. Still some way to go before I can do a full 5k in 30 minutes, but I'll get there. From now on, it's not about ""how"", just ""when"".

This ended up being a far longer post than I had thought it would be

Now I'm going on a little fishing trip for a few days. It's going to be great with some new sceneries to run in with my new found motivation.",self,t5_2rgoq,False,,done,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/C25K/comments/1hxb65/i_dreaded_this_day_but_w5d3_conquered_with_ease/
