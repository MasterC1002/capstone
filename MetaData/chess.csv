When I was in my ""athlete"" days, and in football, I had a knack for knowing what the opposition was trying to do. I probably was a better player than I should have been, because I had almost no real athletic ability, but I managed to do pretty well. I learned to listen to pros am college coaches on (for lack of a better term) ""how the pros mind works"". For example, what goes through a major league baseball players mind
during an at bat? Once I learned to think like that, speed, strength.

So my broad question is...what went through Fischer or Kasporavs mind during a match? How did they think their way through a game? Another question would be

""I was playing in a tournament in germany one year when a man approached me. Thinking he just wanted an autograph, in case the man was dangerous as well as insane, but the man continued: 'I'll bet you 1000 marks that if you come back to my hotel room I can prove it to you.' Well, 1000 marks was 1000 marks, so I humored the fellow and accompanied him to his room.""

""Back at the room, but I found to my horror that white's pieces coordinated very strangely, and that I was going to be mated on the 12th move!""

""I tried again, once again I found my king surrounded, with mate to fall on the 12th move. I asked the man to wait while I ran downstairs and fetched Emmanuel Lasker, who was world champion before me. He was extremely skeptical, but agreed to at least come and play. Along the way we snagged Alekhine, who was then world champion, and the three of us ran back up to the room.""

""Lasker took no chances, pointless-looking series of maneuvers, found himself hemmed in a mating net from which there was no escape. Alekhine tried his hand, too, but all to no avail.""

""It was awful! Here we were, and it was all over! The tournaments, the matches, everything - chess had been solved, white wins.""

If you answer 1.Nf3 with e5 because you didn't notice your pawn could be taken then don't post your shitty game. Use some damn quality control.

Chess players would rather see a game you lost but played well than some godawful game where you won by stumbling into a mate.

Analyze your games with an engine before you submit them. See faq for free engines and interfaces. That way you won't ask for critiques of games where you failed to notice the guy had his queen hanging for 3 moves and you didn't take it.

Here is how it works:

2. Sign up. If you aren't a Chess.com member

If you aren't yet a Chess.com member

Games are all rated with 3 days per move. You will be in groups of 6

3. Post your reddit name in the tournament comments. That way we know who to make fun of when we see you on reddit. Or severely shame if we catch you cheating (see below). 

4. Don't Cheat. That means: don't get help from friends. Don't use computers. If you think the biggest chess site doesn't know when you are cheating, http://i.qkme.me/3u6c0m.jpg

5. Win Prizes. Each section has the following prizes:

Finally got around to writing it.,iglookid,77,9,35,"Just [came across](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1cz41n/what_is_the_most_unbelievable_fact_you_have_ever/c9lexyk) a mention of the fact that the number possible chess games is larger than the number of stars in the universe. However

Imagine this:

- Take a computer which can generate *10 million billion* unique chess games (or outcomes) per second. The [fastest civilian computer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titan_(supercomputer\)) today should be able to achieve this.
- Replace *all the atoms in the known universe*
- Have all of these computers run in parallel *since the beginning of the universe* till today!

If you somehow arrange things so that only unique outcomes are generated between all the computers, and have them run continuously since the big bang, would you have exhausted all the possible chess outcomes.

Even if you managed to generate all these outcomes,000 trillion trillion trillion games per atom to be able to store your entire database.

References:

- Number of chess outcomes: Roughly [10^120](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shannon_number).
- Number of atoms in the known universe: Roughly [10^80](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observable_universe#Matter_content).
- Age of universe in seconds: Roughly [10^17 seconds](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_of_the_universe).
- Speed of current fastest civilian supercomputer: Over [10 petaFLOPs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titan_(supercomputer\)) (or 10^15 FLOPs).

Note that I've used only order-of-magnitude calculations here. This is perfectly justified, and you would need to replace each atom by 10 **b**illion supercomputers!

If you're interested, you would have to take all of the atoms of our universe, and *replace each one of them with a universe like ours*! Then collect all of the atoms from all of these universe, and *replace all of them with a universe like ours*! Wait, we aren't done yet! Repeat this atom-universe replacement once more, and once more, and once more... roughly *seven times* in all! After that you will have to then go through the above thing of replacing all those atoms with supercomputers, to achieve Go complexity!

But

This was only humanly-playable Go games! By this I mean Go games as they are commonly encountered between humans, the lower limit for the complexity is 10^10^48, and the upper limit is 10^(10^171). If we take the more conservative estimate, 10^(10^48), then we are talking about doing the atom-universe replacements 10^46 times! That is a little short of the number of atoms that make up earth (10^(50)).

That's all, do mention if you spot any.

* **Q. What is the best way to improve my game?**

* **A.** In short, positional considerations, etc are all essential, but for a beginner nothing will better your game as rapidly as improving your tactical ability.  When you tire of tactics and want to play, focus on slow time control games so you have an opportunity to analyze each move rather than just playing reflexively.  You should also be aware of how to win basic endgames such as K+P vs K and K+R vs K.

* **Q. How can I improve my tactics?**
* **A.** Learn the basic tactical motifs and then practice

* **Q. What are some useful chess websites.** 
* **A.** [chesscafe.com](http://www.chesscafe.com/) has lots of articles and essays and links

* **Q. How can I play chess online?**
* **A.** You can play on a chess server like [FICS](http://www.freechess.org/) (free) or [ICC](http://www.chessclub.com/) (paid). You can also play in your browser on websites like [lichess.org](http://lichess.org/) or [chess.com](http://www.chess.com/).

* **Q. What are some recommended books?**
* **A.** There are thousands upon thousands of chess books

* **Q. How can I use a computer program to improve?**
* **A.** The most common use of computer programs is to analyze your games. This helps you find tactical shots you or your opponent missed. You can also play games against certain engines that have a limited strength mode such as Shredder.  Some programs include helpful lessons and tutorials

* **Q. What computer programs are available?**
* **A.** You will need a GUI (graphical user interface) and a chess engine. The most popular GUIs are [Fritz](http://www.chessbase-shop.com/en/categories/49) (paid), which are just as strong as commercial ones for all practical purposes, include [Crafty](http://www.craftychess.com/) and [Stockfish](http://www.stockfishchess.com/).

1317075286.0,ks9r6,Just realized a neat trick for calculating knight moves (for beginners and veterans alike),BaconMaker,62,2,11,"***Semi-long read

So I got to thinking about the pattern knights move in, three, or even four moves away, without any calculating, and after some thinking, I figured out an easy way to do so. Here it goes, I'll try to use pictures whenever I can:

* 
[First

* 
[Second, no?](http://i.imgur.com/ismF2.png)

* 
[Next

* [Going even further


* [Lastly, that despite looking close, actually take four moves to land on.](http://i.imgur.com/97SEf.png)


Now this all looks very colorful and pretty,](http://i.imgur.com/uGkeS.png) because knights are primarily close quarters combatants compared to their counterpart, the bishop.

As you can see

1. looking at the original 8 squares the knight can land on and choosing one

2. looking at the next 8 squares the knight can land on from that new location and choosing a new square to go to

3. looking at another 8 squares that the knight can land on from this 3rd position and seeing if it lands on the square you originally wanted to land on.

... you can just do this:

1. Is the square I want to go to on the 1st

2. Know that the nth ring take n moves to reach (with the exception of the corners

Seems a lot easier, if not then easier.  Once you master that, then you could even go so far as to memorize the pattern outside of the 5x5 box, but I feel like that might be too much to start out with, and frankly not as useful.

Alright, and then jump (**EDIT** For clarity, you are making knight moves in this stage, not just any jump to a different color. The jump has to be a legal knight move) BACKWARDS from green (if applicable) to blue (if applicable) to yellow to red.

**EDIT/**: But, but it is still doable. Say you want to get 1 square to the left in [this position.](http://i.imgur.com/qhZz4.png)  Well we immediately know that square takes three moves minimum to arrive at because it is blue when we overlay our new diamond pattern. The process is similar to before, you just have to eliminate certain squares as you jump from from blue to yellow to red. So we look at our blue square and determine that [these](http://i.imgur.com/132Z8.png) are the only yellow squares that you have to choose from due to the black pawns. Next, you look at which of these yellow squares can be reached in one move from the red squares, and you get [this.](http://i.imgur.com/5bQiy.png) A little more thinking can tell you that the top left yellow square is actually falsely yellow despite there not being a black pawn there, because it falls on the corner of our 5x5 square (something you could have noticed immediately). I'll admit this method becomes more difficult on a crowded board, but with practice

I haven't found a foolproof way to calculate a move order that works the first time every time, but that's just a guess.

So there you have it. Maybe some of you already knew this, I can't find any improvements. Let me know if it helps!",,False,self,t5_2qhr7,True,,

1.c4 c5 2.Nc3 g6 3.g3 Bg7 4.Bg2 Nc6 5.Nf3 d6 6.O-O Qd7 $5 
    {This is an idea of Bent Larsen which I've seen labelled as 
    interesting but also passive. That might be so
    difficult to play against.}
7.d3 b6 8.Rb1 Bb7 9.Bd2 
    {A sensible precaution as in some cases Black can play Bxc3 to double 
    White's pawn on the c-file.}
9...Nh6 
    {Avoids blocking the long diagonal and prepares Nf5 to gain a strong 
    grip on d4.}
10.a3 Nf5 11.b4 
    {White plays a standard pawn advance on the Queenside. However Black's
    queenside doesn't present any obvious weaknesses to exploit.}
11...O-O 12.b5 
    {I think this is a mistake. White fixes the pawn structure and gains 
    space on the queenside but invites exchanges which usually favour the 
    side with less space.}
12...Ncd4 13.Nxd4 Nxd4 14.e3 Bxg2 15.Kxg2 Qb7+ 
    {Black controls both long diagonals and takes over the initiative.}
16.e4 
    {White blocks the long diagonal and takes control of d5 but gives 
    Black an outposts on d4. }
    ( 16.f3 {Simply forcing Black to move his Knight.} )
16...f5 
    {Black uses pin on the long diagonal to attack and weaken Whites 
    center.}
17.f3 fxe4 18.dxe4 Rf7 
    {Prepares to double on the f-file to target White's backward f3 pawn 
    which supports e4.}
19.Nd5 Raf8 20.f4 
    {White is forced to weaken e4.}
20...e6 $1 
    {Kicks the knight from d5
    to slide across to the King-side
    long diagonal and weakens f4 by removing a defender.}
21.Nc3 g5 
    {Exploits the pin on the f-file and e pawn to attack and further 
    weaken White's center.}
22.Qh5 gxf4 23.Bxf4 Nf5 
    {Again
    attack on Nc3 which is now the sole defender of e4.}
24.Qg4 
    {White pins the g7 Bishop and defends the e pawn laterally}
24...Kh8 25.Bd2 Bd4 
    {e3 and f2 look very weak. Black has threats like Ne3+
    Queen and Rook or Nh4+ Qxh4 Rf2+ attacking the King and Bishop.}
26.Rbe1 Be3 
    {Here I looked at pretty much every legal move available including Ne3
    and Nxg3 which I probably would've ended up playing in a live game. 
    However
    I didn't fancy playing an endgame where my King was so far from the 
    center. Instead I decided to just swap White's active Bishop and wait 
    and see what White does after Nd4.}
27.Qe2 Bxd2 28.Qxd2 Nd4 
    {Black has every piece homing in on the f3 square.}
29.Qd3 Qe7 
    {I didn't like moving my Queen off the long diagonal
    see anything better and thought I might be able to take control of the
    other long diagonal instead.}
30.Ne2 
    {This looks terrible since it removes 2 defenders of the e4 square
    the Knight c3 and the Rook e1. }
30...Nf3 
    {I saw this move instantly and had to stop myself from playing it 
    while I worked through the variations.}
31.Rd1 Ne5 32.Qc3 Qb7 
    {Blacks Queen returns to the long diagonal}
33.Qc2 Ng4 34.Qc3+ Kg8 
    {Finally the e4 pawn falls

* Feedback in comments. Nobody wants to publish to a graveyard.

The ultra sharp 3 e5 lines require extensive opening knowledge
impossible to play without extensive preparation. I have a great surplus 
of points from those lines
The quiet moves go to Kings-Indian attack
3. d3 Nc6 4. g3 d5 5. Nbd2 e5 6. Bg2 Be7 
7. O-O O-O 8. c3  h6 
{ Questionable move. The idea is right
to prevent Ng5
and get mated a tempo faster than in KID
d5xe4
Now the most principled move is exd5! Nxd5 Re1 and 
the normal support move f7-f6 leaves h6 look just silly. White has dangerous
tactical chances in the center. In the game continuation it just loses a tempo. }
9. Qb3 {?} dxe4 {!} 10. dxe4 Qc7 11. Re1 Be6 12. Qc2 b5 
{ I have managed win a tempo
exchange Kings Indian. }
13. Nf1 Rad8 14. Ne3 c4 15.  Nh4 Rfe8 16. Nef5 Bf8 
{ So far White has played logically. Since I'm obviously better in the queen side
he plays for an attack too. I'm not afraid. I like the style of Steinitz and 
Korchnoi
superiority. The next move is just a horrific blunder. The move a2-a4 would be 
good if white could force axb5
weakens b4, and does absolutely nothing
for white. Any other would be better. }
17. a4 {??} b4 {Of course. cxb4 Nxb4 is totally crushing. White now starts again
logically
18. h3 Rd7 19. g4 Red8 
{Red8?? and the tide turns. I made this natural move fast
control of the center and queen side will just play itself. Except
look look what the 100% obvious reply is...}
20. g5 hxg5 21. Bxg5
{ I intentionality avoid all the four letter words in my analysis
unfortunately this time I find no replacements. This pin is deadly. Korchnoi looks 
with disgust and Steinitz turns in his grave. My safe bomb shelter will be 
permanently opened and that's that. So far I was ahead in clock
time to take that sarcastic Russian trainer advice
position
Nh5-Nf4
soon dominate queen side. The alternative was to allow Bxf6 and live with the 
doubled pawns. So now I spent a long time
threats in the king side. I should have just hoped for the best and go for it
since I had no real alternative anyway
bxc3 22. bxc3 Qa5 23. Qe2 
{ Qe2! Just so. White abandons the whole queen side and goes to all and out king hunt.
Now I don't know what's actually happening here
make my defensive calculations easier. Unfortunately
calculations easier. A move that's good against a computer is not necessarily the 
best against a human. }
Bxf5 24. Nxf5 Ne7 25. Bxf6 gxf6 26. Qg4+ Ng6 
{ The starting point I tried to estimate at move 21. White's attack is dangerous
but so is the weakness at c3 real. An intense race starts here. }

30. Rf1 Kh7 
{ This move is one of the sweaty moments. Of course I cannot allow h5 winning the 
knight
me kind of desperate. To be honest
Qh5+ just blocks the h-pawn
31. Nd5 {! I'm losing the f6 pawn with check. Can I really survive this? } 
Qb2 32. Nxf6+ Kg7 33. Nd5 c3 { It would be totally satisfying to play like this 
if your king was safe. } 34. h5 c2 
35. Qg5 { ! Facing moves like this with seconds in your clock is not pleasant. }

39. Qxe5+ f6 40. Qd5
{ I got my hopes up at this point
The best tries for black are Bc5 or Rg5
I don't know what would happen
that the white queen needs to guard e4
 Qxa4 {?} 41. Rb1 {! The material is even
Rb7+ is the final time trouble blunder. } Bb4 {?? I would have lost on time with any reasonable expectations. }

1353896348.0,13sgdl,A few tips for fellow chess players at 1000-1500 who would like to improve their elo!,SavingPrivateParts,55,10,21,"I've been on this subreddit for many months now and I've noticed a few reoccurring patterns being posted on games. I can tell that many of the games are on the mentioned elo purely by common mistakes in the early game which, so I'll put this out there and hopefully can put it to active use!

ALSO: I am not a high elo player. I'm 1800s on online play and currently 1720 FIDE who has recently gone up from 1300 level just by following a few basic ideas.

1) Development. Most of these games fall back behind simple concepts. **you do not need to know GM opening theory to win your games** , stop it -.-. you need to follow basic concepts:

* Put your minor pieces to contest the center. Controlling the center gives the most options for attack.
* Try not to move pawns. Sure there are plenty of openings with a lot of pawn movements
* Slow opponent development. If you ever see the opponent give you a chance to achieve one of the other points while slowing theirs

occasionally when i get a match up with somebody who's under 1400, they all must follow those principles. 

2) look for tactics when pieces interact. you have a knight that can take a bishop or a pawn? give it a thought. there are always tactics that you will find even when calculating moves that seem strange at first. Even if nothing comes of it

3) and finally, except maybe in 1min chess. Once you've achieved the development of pieces start working on a strategy. There is no strategical vs. tactical player in chess, to win you need both. Sit back, and invest time on working on your plan, this is the most critical part of the game, don't just move a piece for the sake of it. The way i like to put it is that every move is worth a pawn, moving something for the sake of it is as good as giving your opponent free material. 

hope this helps somebody. i'm not saying take everything to heart

**The Grünfeld Defence**


&gt; 1.d4 Nf6

&gt; 2.c4 g6

&gt; 3.Nc3 d5 

http://i.imgur.com/OwV0IRH.jpg

The opening relies on one of the main principles of the hypermodern school

The first instance of this opening is in an 1855 game by Moheschunder Bannerjee, in May 1855:

&gt; 1.d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. Nc3 d5 4. e3 Bg7 5. Nf3 O-O 6. cxd5 Nxd5 7. Be2 Nxc3 8. bxc3 c5 9. O-O cxd4 10. cxd4 Nc6 11. Bb2 Bg4 12. Rc1 Rc8 13. Ba3 Qa5 14. Qb3 Rfe8 15. Rc5 Qb6 16. Rb5 Qd8 17. Ng5 Bxe2 18. Nxf7 Na5 
and White mates in three 19.Nh6+ double check Kh8 20.Qg8+ Rxg8 21.Nf7# 1-0. 

*([Link to game](http://www.chessgames.com/perl/chessgame?gid=1336349)

It gained popularity after Ernst Grünfeld introduced it into international play at Vienna 1922, he defeated future world champion Alexander Alekhine. Grünfeld usually employed a very classical style. The defence was later adopted by a number of prominent players, including Vasily Smyslov, Viktor Korchnoi, Leonid Stein, and Bobby Fischer. Garry Kasparov often used the defence, including in his World Championship matches against Anatoly Karpov in 1986, and Vladimir Kramnik in 2000. Currently active notable players who employ the opening include Loek van Wely, Luke McShane and Gata Kamsky. Anand employed it twice in the World Chess Championship 2010. In the World Chess Championship 2012 between Anand and Boris Gelfand

The Game of the Century between Donald Byrne and 13-year old Bobby Fischer on October 17, although arriving in the Grünfeld via a transposition of moves (using 1.Nf3 Nf6 2.c4 g6 3.Nc3 Bg7 4.d4 0-0 5.Bf4 d5). ([Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gr%C3%BCnfeld_Defence))

*****

[Go here.](http://www.playwitharena.com/?Download:Arena_3.0)  Arena is not an engine or a database (although it nicely comes pre-installed with both).  Instead it is GUI which makes it easy to use and hook up extra engines/databases as per your liking.  There are other GUIs but seeing as I use Arena

You have two choices at this point - whether to download the zip which doesn't include a way to install Arena (but does allow you to run it as a stand-alone program) or whether to download the setup. Either way

*****

Once that's done the program is now working but there are some ways to tweak it if you want.  For example

*****

Let's try to add an engine eg. Stockfish.  Find their website and download the appropriate version.  Then go to Arena and under Engines choose 'Install engine' (it's as if they were making it idiot-proof!).  Once you've found it (there may well be different versions depending on your computer hardware so watch out) it will ask whether it uses the UCI or Winboard protocol.  You should be able to find out this info through their website but if you get it wrong

*****

To play a game against the engine, you can right click somewhere in the box and go to Configure Engine Analysis Output &gt; Mainlines.  I normally untick everything except the moves and the evaluation.  If you don't want to the computer to make a move, make sure the 'Edit' button is highlighted.  This will prevent the engine from changing the board in any way and is the main way I analyse my games.

One important aspect of using the engine is its level.  By going to Levels &gt; Adjust you can change how the engine behaves.  Obviously if you only give it 1sec to make a move it will be less accurate than if you give it 30 (but that might give you a chance of beating it).  I only really use the engine for analysing games so I have it set on infinite and just stop it working after I'm satisfied it's not suddenly going to find a new best move.

The last major thing to know is how to set up a position.  This can be done in several ways.  If you have a PNG or an EPD

For those who don't know how to I'll write a short

* download Arena GUI

http://www.playwitharena.de/downloads/arena_3.0.zip

* download the last free Houdini

http://www.cruxis.com/download/Houdini_15a.zip and pick the one for your computer(i.e if you have 32 bit get the 32 bit and same for 64 bit)

* Follow the instructions given by Arena in order to install Houdini into it(under the engines tab).

After doing this you will end up with Arena with Houdini in it.

A basic overview of using the program:

save your PGNs from your games to a certain folder.

In Arena click on the PGN tab

Any suggestions let me know

Oh

EDIT: Oh, if it gives you a rating of -1.00 you are behind by a pawn. If behind by -0.05 it means you have a slightly worse position or move set. This analyzes the chances of the REPLIES. For example, if you do e4, it'll tell you something like -0.27 which means that black is behind by around a quarter of a pawn.

It will tell you this number in the bar beneath the playing area. It is the only section that has numbers like -0.05.",self,t5_2qhr7,1338518163.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/chess/comments/uer59/how_to_start_with_computer_analysis/

My conclusion was that if it was black's turn, then black takes the queen h1-&gt;g1, and that's checkmate. 

If it was red's turn, or at least no immediate checkmate came to mind.

It turned out to be red's move:

Confusingly moving the rook at b5 to b2 to take a pawn. So black's victory was assured

This move makes no sense to me. You take the queen instead of forcing the obvious check that leads to checkmate. And

For the last few days I have been constructing a playlist overview page here:

http://www.chessworld.net/chessclubs/playlistvideosstructure.asp

I hope you find it useful. The inspiration for this page came from how the Khan academy educational videos were laid out in a pleasing three column format. Also the guy behind the Khan academy seems to have a truly educational vision for the use of Videos and interactive software as this Ted video shows :

http://www.ted.com/talks/salman_khan_let_s_use_video_to_reinvent_education.html

He talks about the concept of a classroom ""flip"" where the homework becomes to watch the videos and the classroom becomes the place to do the homework. 

Chess though is not easy to categorise games. Chess games can fall into multiple categories of insight - but I think this evolving structure so far is quite reasonable. 

I have also been doing more dual commentary videos with my good friend Chris who is soon to be IM titled officially. We hope to cover the playoff games between Anand and Gelfand played today - they will be in the World championship 2012 playlist.

Some of my better videos this week:

First you'll need the database itself. There are a few free options available. My current preference is for “SCID vs. PC” which is an updated version of the free SCID database. It's available for download from Sourceforge:

http://scidvspc.sourceforge.net/

SCID is fairly complex

There's also an online text tutorial:

Next you'll need an analysis engine. Houdini 1.5a has long been the strongest free chess engine available

Download for Houdini 1.5a

http://www.cruxis.com/chess/houdini.htm

Download for Stockfish 2.3.1

http://stockfishchess.org/download/

-----

You'll also need some games. The two largest free games collections that I know of are the Million Base and ICOPY databases.

Million Base now includes 2.2 Million games and has been updated with ""The Week In Chess"" games up to January 2013

http://www.top-5000.nl/pgn.htm

The ICOPY database includes a whopping 4.6 million games

You'll want to keep your database up to date by downloading TWIC pgn files each week.

I've heard, after several hundred games, I find myself wary to castle too early.

It seems to happen often that when I castle early, and sure enough, some pawn trades will happen and suddenly my king is vulnerable and stuck on the open side of the board.  Then my opponent calmly castles on the other side and proceeds to finish off my king before I can launch a similar attack on their castled king. 
Also

I've recently started playing Queen's Gambit, implying that I'll castle kingside if I castle at all (and who doesn't?).  So they do their best to mess up my kingside guard pawns before I even castle.  The only response I can ever think to give to that is to simultaneously pawn rush their queenside, so that we'll both end up over-extended on one side and messed up on the other.  This is rather weak.  It offers a complicated, destructive, even-ish game.

So

I find myself more and more inclined to maintain ambiguity as to my castle side

Thoughts?

EDIT: Here's part of a theoretical game where white opens with d4 and castles on the kingside

[pgn] 1. d4 d5 2. c4 h6 3. Nc3 e6 4. e3 g5 5. Bd3 dxc4 6. Bxc4 Bd6 7. Nge2 f5 8. O-O Nf6 [/pgn]

How should white best take advantage of black's undeveloped queenside, foil, cut off, and exploit the advanced pawn wall?  Or should white, as others suggested, attack the center?

I propose that we, open, and online chess database. We can warehouse all of the important historical chess games in our database. We should use a format that's both ubiquitous and easy to use (I suggest SQL).

This database would both serve as an historical account of the chess world and as a tool for research. First, as a tool for research, the database should be easily ""analyzable"". A SQL database allows for far more detailed queries than a .pgn database, and as such, allows for much more detailed analyses.

I wanted to do something new, a lot of great ones, but eventually I had to be realistic (falconry, as badass as it sounds, just doesn't work for me) so I picked another one in the list, chess! I now have to dedicate my free time to chess for (at least) the next year. If I give up, I will do a money donation to a local childrens' hospital (for an amount big enough to make me want to stick with this!)

I should mention that I have never played chess

So that's it. If you have anything to suggest that'd be greatly appreciated. I'll be looking for a local club and see if I can get some practice with actual people

I have just begun playing competitive USCF rated chess.  In my first event I finished 4.0/5.0 dropping one game due to fatigue missing a simply tactic.  I have been teaching and helping several 1900-2100 players with their tournament prep.  I have played chess for approximately 4 years and have a positive score against crafty 23.4 and have scored wins against Fritz 11 and several other high rated engines including Rybka.  In order to help not only others improve but help myself improve as both a player and a coach.

So /r/chess if I started posting about 30minutes to an hour of chess advice and analysis every day would you watch it?  If you are in favor of it what would you recommend as topics.  I'm currently thinking of doing at least 1 or 2 casts on playing blindfold simuls as well as on what I call Tal style attacks and forming a strong opening repertoire.

So /r/chess would you be interested in going on this magical journey with me?

Edit: Hey everyone my cast will be at livestream.com/BosskOnASegway

The simple instructions are under each puzzle. From what I've found they should be about as tricky as a tough sudoku.

I've developed a script to create these puzzles, please email me *mail {at} lukesurl {dot} com*!)  but I thought I should get a bit of testing in first.

So

* The first dozen or so moves are theory. The most common plan for white in the symmetrical English (1. c4 c5) is to play d4. Black's opening tries to slow d4

* 14... e5 was a bit strange and probably not best. I have a slight edge. 

* After 21... Rac8

* After I play 30. Nxc5! I've saved a lost position. Any other move and I lose more material. I stop taking notation at this point which means I have less than five minutes left. From this point on I'm recreating the game from memory.

* Unfortunately I missed 35. d6! which wins for me.

* An option is 38. Qh8+

* After 40... Nxd4 I'm up a pawn but only temporarily. I can't hold onto the d pawn. It's a classic bishop vs. knight endgame where I have a slight edge because bishops trump knights in open endgame positions where there are pawns on both sides of the board. With best play white has winning chances but we're both in time trouble and black is a GM so it's likely I draw or even lose this endgame.

* I can't remember what I played after 48... Kf6 but the game ended in a draw maybe 30 moves later. We ended up queening at the same time (I queened my a-pawn while he queened his g-pawn) and the game ended as a draw.

----------------------------------------

This is my first time doing something like this, and I'd say ~1500 USCF (I'm technically 1400, but I've only played OTB for a few months and swept a U1700 tournament a few years ago. Otherwise, I haven't played enough to really increase it above the 1200 I started with)). This is all to let you know that my advice is not coming from someone as experienced and knowledgeable as youtubers like Jerry from ChessNetwork, but from someone closer to the beginner side of the spectrum. Still, I think I have a pretty cool opening to offer players wishing to improve their tactical game.

**How I think of the opening.**
-----------------------------

The Danish Opening is an extremely aggressive opening on white's part, white should dictate the flow of the game for the first 15-20 moves. This opening is particularly strong in blitz, as black has less time to make the correct moves to react to white's threats. Playing similarly rated players as myself in blitz, I win about 75% of the time with white with this opening, in contrast to 65% with all other openings (with white). As a warning in advance, chess masters and the like have largely dismissed this opening as unsound, as black can equalize the position with material to boot with perfect play, I don't think perfect play is something you should worry about.

**The videos**

The videos come in 5 parts (5 minutes each, and go over some common themes that arise from it. I hope you enjoy!

1350155024.0,11fbdv,Favourite chess quotes #21  Harpo Marx,Nosher,35,8,2,"Harpo spent some time in Moscow in 1933. Groucho and Chico didn't go:


""One day when there was no matinee I ducked out and went looking for some kind of action. In front of a good-sized theatre

Since the day I bought my outfit at the government store I had become used to the idea that foreigners didn’t stand in line. I went up to the box office and waved a dollar bill in the window. The cashier grabbed the buck and gave me a ticket. Valootye – foreign currency – worked like magic in Moscow.

The house was packed, drinking and eating. Others were sleeping or reading. I had apparently come in during the intermission. Yet the curtain was raised and the stage was lit. Oddest of all was the setting on the stage. There was a small table and a chair. On the table were two telephones, and a bunch of knickknacks. Behind the table was a large, tilted mirror.

It was the longest intermission I ever sat through. Fifteen minutes passed. Twenty minutes. Twenty-five. Nobody seemed to mind waiting that long for the next act.

Then a buzzer sounded. People damn near trampled each other to get back to their seats. In 30 seconds the theatre was silent as a tomb. Everybody was watching the empty stage.

A boy, then hangs up without saying anything. He moves one of the little props on the table. The joint is so quiet I can hear my wrist watch ticking. The boy moves another knickknack. A guy comes out, walks to the footlights, announces something to the audience, and the joint goes wild.

People jump to their feet. They yell and throw their hats in the air and embrace each other. The guy who made the announcement shakes hands with the boy and the cheers are deafening. This is absolutely the craziest show I ever saw.

Finally it dawned on me what I had been watching. A chess match.

The kid on the stage, by long-distance telephone. It was nice to know the home team won, but it would have been nicer if I could have gotten my dollar back.""",,False,self,t5_2qhr7,,http://www.reddit.com/r/chess/comments/11fbdv/favourite_chess_quotes_21_harpo_marx/

I saw the chess-related cover and wanted to see if it is a checkmate

Here's my reasoning:

* the king could not have moved last

* the queen could not have moved last

* the knight could not have moved last

* the rook could not have moved last because then the king was already in check by the queen and the knight.

* no other piece not shown could have moved last because the king was already in check.

Am I correct? Is it indeed impossible to reach this position in a game?

Ercole del Rio, practical Observations by an anonymous Modenese Author""), was the first author to mention what is now called the Scotch Game. The opening received its name from a correspondence match in 1824 between Edinburgh and London. Popular in the 19th century, by 1900 the Scotch had lost favour among top players because it was thought to release the central tension too early and allow Black to equalise without difficulty. More recently, grandmasters Garry Kasparov and Jan Timman helped to re-popularize the Scotch when they used it as a surprise weapon to avoid the well-analysed Ruy Lopez.

Second round: Second game was against a 13-year-old whiz kid from Michigan

Third round: This game was my toughest and my only loss, and tricky), though against a master-strength player I survived fairly long.

Fourth Round: This was also a very difficult game and I made a risky move in time pressure that ended up working.

Fifth Round: This game.... I swindled the win. But my opponent was 20 minutes late to the board, your temperament over the board can really make a difference, and I think he was too distracted to see the swindle coming.",,False,self,t5_2qhr7,,http://www.reddit.com/r/chess/comments/1gytgj/my_five_games_from_the_columbus_open/

(new video about this here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkpt8bqzbw)

I wanted to highlight some thoughts recently about the difference between winning and losing chess games. I answered on another thread but thought this deserves a new thread topic.

What is the difference to you between winning and losing?!

Here are my initial thoughts: 

- Winning and losing have quite a lot in common for most people here :
In both cases both you and your opponent usually made terrible blunders.

Tartakower observed this and in jest said :

""The winner of the game is the player who makes the next-to-last mistake.""

- In both cases you can try and improve your game from objective review of the game.

Both were games to be enjoyed for hopefully the most part except if you were tortured in a lost position for hours.

- The end result might be different - that's about it really for the difference between winning and losing for most redditors here I would assume. 

For 'chess as a sport' fans the end result often means winning turns into celebration and complacency for not doing an objective review of the game - setting oneself up for future losses. For the losers they are more likely to want to turn the pain of losing into a 'lesson' and therefore potentially might improve their underlying chess strength if they do an objective review. They set themselves up more if they do this for potentially winning more in the future if their underlying game strength improves.

Capablanca observed the ""chess as a sport"" symptoms and is quoted as saying:

""Most players ... do not like losing

Kasparov considers his game content or used to for continuous rechecking

1359081654.0,178d2l,A few tips from a (reasonably) experienced player for online play,ICanSpellCheckForYou,28,7,12,"Some of these may be common sense

1. If you are low on time with an absolutely dominating position (like the player who lost on time with a queen and rook vs a pawn)

2. The object of the game is to win. If you see a sacrifice that wins instantly, it isn't), it is generally best to check for a better move after you consider an unclear sacrifice. If there isn't, go for it. However, if you have the time, you are more likely to earn a clean win than a messy one where you might lose.

3. If you fall into a slump

4. If you find yourself getting emotionally attached to your play

5. Don't play late into the night. When you're tired

6. If your opponent is low on time, if your opponent is low on time, repeating moves and holding the position can make your opponent rush and make hasty moves to make your job easier (assuming the position allows for this).

7. If low on time in a time control setting where you can add time to your clock by moving

8. Premove recaptures or if your opponent has to make a really obvious move (obvious recapture, however, or he could catch you off guard and this would hurt.

1341417064.0,w19rz,A list of useful chess ideas,protagonic,27,5,35,"I think one of the main things that separates an experienced player from a beginner is that the experienced player has a repertoire of ideas that the beginner has not. They are really just shortcuts that help in making sense of a position. 

Of course, skewers, along with some typical instances of them. The basic strategic ideas also: control of the centre, activity of pieces, etc. 

What I'm looking for and could not find, so feel free to add whatever. 

A few examples I can think of:

Rook lift. There was just an article about this on chess.com. It's not something that I have played very often in my own games

Counting defenders and attackers. I remember when I was just starting out and learned/realised this, then my other knight takes... and so on. You can just count the amount of defenders and attackers, and if they are the same then the piece or square is defended, if you have more you can take then. But beware of the value of the pieces, the order in which they take and any inbetween moves (another important idea)!

Opposition. It's way harder to calculate an endgame if you don't know this. It is a pretty standard idea though... also the idea that the king should be in the square of the passed pawn in order to prevent queening, etc. 

Rooks belong behind the passed pawn!

I find the idea of a fortress fascinating,,False,self,t5_2qhr7,False,,True

Many times I find myself in situations where I can force an exchange that leaves me with the bishop pair, but I feel like I need the ability to capitalize on even these small advantages if I am going to keep improving. What should I do to get the most out of my bishop pair?  I am hoping for concrete tactical/positional plans, not simply ""open the position"" type responses.

Anyway, I win by simply playing defensively, protecting my pieces, and waiting for him to put one of his valuable pieces in a vulnerable position. I whittle down his guys until nothing's left but the king. Literally the last 8 matches have ended in the exact same scenario: He makes mistakes until he has just one knight or rook left, I eventually manage to capture it because I have at least four or five non-pawn pieces on the board, and then I checkmate him by pinning his king between an edge and a rook column, then moving my queen into the same column as his king. I'm pretty sure I'm describing the most absolute rudimentary method of approaching a chess game.

I was somewhat torn about posting this game, White's 17th is probably the most aesthetically pleasing single move I've played to date (not particularly hard to find, just pretty and somewhat paradoxical).  

Second, made me realize something rather important:  the fewer problems you create for your opponent (in this case, me), the stronger your opponent will play.  

In this case, so I spent a fair bit of time trying to figure out what it is that I did and how to do it again.

Finally, was to make sure that we never found out.

I was playing a blitz game (I'm white; 10 min. controls) with a friend today, while I had 13. Not wanting to pick up a cheap win off a drawn position, I offered a draw, which he (of course) took.

We did have an interesting discussion afterward, because that's the nature of blitz chess. I'm not sure I agree, because the win would be pretty much meaningless to me. (We're certainly not playing in a tournament here.)

Thoughts? What would you have done?

In 1981-2 he took part in the seventh series of  The Master Game

Most importantly though

Larry was up against a teenaged Nigel Short. Larry got a good position with a bit of an attack. He went straight for Nigel's king and both players seemed to think Short was on the ropes. Nigel kept finding strong defensive moves and Larry kept pressing his attack.

Finally

""Wow

Larry says some other great stuff and you can see the encounter [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzEYVuiS3CU).

How it works: a top level comment should be one of your recent games.

Step 1: Post the site of the game (chess.com, etc), the ratings of the two players, the time controls, and which side you played. 

Step 2: post the game pgn. Remember to add [ pgn] [ /pgn]. Add whatever commentary you'd like

Step 3: any response should be a second level comment. Upvotes and downvotes according to how interesting the game was

1329054633.0,pm0wi,My method for determining what to work on.,goltrpoat,24,3,17,"The most difficult thing about studying chess without a trainer is figuring out *what* to work on.  This is reflected in the number of posts here that ask the perfectly legitimate

One well-known methodology is to analyze your own games.  This is, and should always be at the core of any training regimen.  However, this method rarely produces *global*, strategic decisions about the direction of your training for, say, the next six months (unless you luck out and have an epiphany along the lines of ""you know, I really have no idea how to play against Benoni-like structures with White"").

I came up with the solution a few months ago, while making the assumption that you'll choose an optimal (but not yet known) training regimen.  Then you solve for the unknown variable, so to speak.

I'll use myself as an example.  First, goal.  To put what follows into context, mine is to surpass 2300 FIDE in three years.  Second, you pretend to get in a time machine, travel to three years from now, and start asking the future you questions;  if your goals are loftier than mine, feel free to replace the time machine with a crowd of reporters.

""What would you say was the main thing responsible for your remarkably consistent improvement over the last three years?""  

Now instead of dealing with a nebulous ""what should I work on"" question, and what the hell is it?

""Well, ""I started to make sure that I'm able to spend at least two hours a day on training *(total lie, at least for now)*, since obtaining actual results requires actual work.  Otherwise, the first thing I realized was that a portion of my opening repertoire was based on simply not understanding the middlegame positions resulting from a number of openings:  I avoided the Gruenfeld main lines and the Meran with White, for instance, which in retrospect denied me entire categories of highly interesting middlegame positions.""

When I came up with that answer, huge, major epiphany.  I strongly suspect it's also what a good trainer would have said after taking a look at my games.  Obviously it's something I knew already, but I really didn't *want to* work on that.  Putting myself in a scenario, made up or not, where I *had to* be honest, seemed to just move that issue to the forefront.

I won't go over the rest of my answer, three years ago your endgame technique was, shall we say, average at best, but you seem to have improved drastically since.  What happened?""  ""Well..."", etc.

I think that the effectiveness of this technique should be fairly universal, so I just figured I'd share in case someone might find it useful.
