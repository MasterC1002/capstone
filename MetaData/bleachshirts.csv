I have been wanting to do contests and drawings here for a while. The biggest issue is that I cant afford to buy or ship out any prizes.   
  
So I was considering creating a little shopping list in the sidebar using the amazon affiliate program and if there is any income from that using it to ship out fabulous and fun prizes.   
  
I don't want this to turn into a Saydrah thing (abusing reddit to make money) but I also thought if nothing else it would provide a good idea of the materials needed and an easy place to get them all at once.  
  
The link to this would go in its own box in the sidebar with a disclaimer letting anyone who goes to click on it that money would be raised from purchases. 
  
Reddit is about the community so I wanted to get some feedback from everyone.  
  
Thanks for reading and keep spraying.

1336808500.0,tjffe,The official /r/bleachshirts FAQ question thread!,,156,30,131,"Several people have asked about it and now we are doing something about it. What questions do you want in a frequently asked questions thread? Ask them here.  
  
 I will gather answers you provide, picture galleries and all kinds of fancy and wonderful things.  
  
With the first round of questions Here is what I have thrown together.  
______________________________________________________________________________ 
  
**Stencil Materials**:   
Many people here have discussed using **[freezer paper](http://www.reynoldskitchens.com/product.asp?prod_id=1798)** Which definitely is the way to go if you are making a 1 time use stencil. If you expect to make several shirts or are new to this and want a stencil you can test first you might want to try stencil paper. A large roll of freezer paper is nicer also if you want to do a larger design. Stencil paper also wont work in many printers so a cutting matte and an x-acto knife are good investments.
  
Personally I like being able to reuse my stencils So I use stencil paper. Stencil paper is just paper coated in a waxy material that is slightly transparent which is nice for tracing. The wax also strengthens the paper so it is less likely to tear when using a tack spray and the bleach wont destroy the stencil. Right now I am using **[this](http://shop.hobbylobby.com/products/wax-o-stencil-paper-427013/)** kind of stencil paper but I also found **[this](http://www.amazon.com/Inovart-Stencil-It-Waxed-Stencil-Paper/dp/B005A0J7TA/ref=sr_1_2?s=toys-and-games&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1336837267&amp;sr=1-2)** on amazon  
   
I have also invested in one of these **[matts](http://shop.hobbylobby.com/search/default.aspx?searchTerm=Self+Healing+Cutting+Mat)** which helps to save money on your cutting blade. The clear one would probably be best as you can use it on a makeshift tracing table
    
**Bleaching a New Shirt**  
Many people are commenting that the bleach is not working as expected

**Bleach**   
Ok so bleach is pretty easy
  
I have thought about using gel bleach but haven't got the chance. Generally the bleach pens are made to be a ""color safe"" bleach so wont work as well.   
  
**VERY IMPORTANT DO NOT MIX BLEACH WITH VINEGAR OR ANYTHING BUT WATER.** Here is why
Basically
  
**The different effects...**  
I was fairly vague in the heading of this one because I am not personally very familiar with many different effects. Finer mist means a smoother image. How you choose to make your image is a great place to start
  
**Glue**  
  
This is another example of my lacking some experience. I only ever use a low tack spray on my stencils while some people have mentioned just ironing the freezer paper onto the shirt. If you want to use glue I recommend **[this](http://www.krylon.com/products/easytack_repositionable_adhesive/)** or something like it
  
  
**The Effect of Bleach on your clothing**  
  
Generally I have found that black shirts tend to go to a brick red then fade out to gold then white. Blue shirts go to yellow red turn orange and purple turns pink. How light they go depends mostly on the concentration of bleach and how long the bleach stays on the shirt. I use a 50/50 blend usually and that gets me where I want to go. If I want to make it really light I will go up to a 60/40 blend and let it sit longer. Eventually they all turn white and then disintegrate at a certain concentration level.  
   
**When you are done bleaching** 
When I am doing these shirts I usually fill up a very large cooler in my back yard with water so I can dump the shirt into it and dilute the bleach to stop the shirt from getting lighter than where I want it
   
After rinsing thoroughly I will then wash the shirts. I usually try to do at least 2-3 shirts at a time so I cut out all my stencils at once so prepping a spray station and cleaning all the stuff up isn't as much of a pain in my ass.
  

**Adding Colors**  
  
So there are a few Ideas I have had about adding color. The best way I can think of doing it is just by drawing on the shirt with a fabric pen. I have also considered adding color with a 2 part stencil. Basically what I have been thinking of doing is making a 2 layer stencil spraying the first layer then **[dying](http://www.ritdye.com/)** the shirt and spraying the second layer. Why do it this way? Well because clothing dyes are generally made to work by soaking the fabric in the dye for an extended period.   
  
By bleaching a shirt you are creating a void where that new color can go
  
  
**Some troubleshooting**  
  
You might have noticed the black shirt in the pony shirt examples I showed you. The black shirt was the first bleach shirt I ever did

The words were found on another image somewhere

I don't have step-by-step pictures

1) Cut out the wolf head template. I used a large sheet of freezer paper for this. The entire head was cut out from the stencil, while the black of the shirt was covered by the stencil.

Lots of tiny pieces

2) Bleach the wolf's head as normal

3) Cut out the letters for the logo down below. Here, no pieces removed) to mask off the wolf head to avoid re-bleaching and bleaching the interior of that design.

Tomorrow will be the first shirt of the week competition. As of right now we have no prizes
  
These are the rules I have in mind for the shirt of the week.
  
 * No shirt of the week thread
  
 * only individual shirts will be considered
   
 * You must post the shirt prior to the day of the competition any new shirts posted on sunday will have to be submitted for shirt of the week the following week.
  
 * To submit a shirt in the upcoming shirt of the week you need to include at least a photograph including the shirt and a note with your reddit ID clearly visible [**like this**](http://i.imgur.com/tAd9O.jpg). I want to make sure that everyone gets credit for their work.  
  
 * If you don't use the appropriate tags your shirt will not be considered. Obviously this will not apply to the first contest. I was trying to figure out a way to encourage everyone to use the tags. This seemed like a good idea. ***this rule will be obsolete before long as untagged posts will be automatically caught by the spam filter  and removed

Though since that day I have been busy and not very attentive/logged in. In so doing

I am pleased to see what a great community this has evolved into

But on to why I am actually writing this....



A while back I made [Moltar_the_fabulous](http://www.reddit.com/user/Moltar_the_fabulous) a moderator and because of that we've seen a huge jump in subscriptions

I will be sticking around as a mod in hopes that in the next few weeks/months I will be able to contribute some more. Yet  I am mostly writing this because I wanted to thank Moltar
