This is my beginner traceur/traceuse resource post. I pretty consistently update, but this is something you can link to when the next wave of new potential traceurs comes through the subreddit asking how to start. It is **not** meant to be a comprehensive post about parkour, but it should nudge you in the right direction (Spoiler alert: Outside, not the internet, is the right direction). Get it? **Reading this will give you an idea of what you can start doing today to be considered a parkour practitioner from here on out.**

**First off**, buy them food, and hang out with these people. They’ll take care of you. 

**If you don't have a group to plug in with** from the start because you can’t find one or you’re terrified of social interaction, feed them, and go through everything together in person. You’re going to be a lot more excited to go out and train if you’re not hitting the pavement alone. I promise.

**Let’s talk shop!**

Here is the reality of beginning parkour: You can go out on Day 1 and

It really helped me when I was just starting out to make a formal list of 5 techniques that I wanted to master and then drill them purposefully for a couple months. Otherwise, step over something and say you've mastered it. You haven't. And you're going to be sorely disappointed when you go to your first jam and realize you know nothing. You need to play with those basic techniques until you've made them your own. More on this later.

**But what about flips?**

What about flips? If you want to learn them

**But where can I train?!? D:**

* Outside: Local fitness trails, man-made things.

* Inside: Open gymnastics gyms

If you can jump on or near it without breaking anything, you can train parkour there. People make this complicated for no reason whatsoever.

**What should I spend my time doing?**

Work on the microscale and work on the macroscale.

The Microscale: 

* Individual techniques. We discussed this above. Choose a few and get to work on them.

* Stay fit to keep doing the things you love, and get on that guy's level. Think you've reached the peak of human strength already? [I guarantee you have not](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZuxcbB_nIh4). Consider taking up [barefoot running](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSIDRHUWlVo).

The Macroscale:

* This is where many traceurs fall short. Everybody spends so much time focusing on specific moves and short sequences

**MY PARKOUR PHILOSOPHY**

This is what I would tell you if I knew you in person.

* Buy yourself a halfway decent pair of tennis shoes (I like Onitsuka Tiger's Ultimate 81s. Read [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/Parkour/comments/12ztt9/five_finger_shoes/c6zpq28) if you're interested in [minimalist shoes](http://www.reddit.com/r/Slackline/comments/10kh89/tried_slacklining_for_the_first_time_yesterday/c6ec3kb).) and some walmart/target/cheap loose fitting sweatpants with a drawstring and then don't think about gear again. **You don't need anything to start parkour.** If you feel the need to buy something
* Go try techniques out for yourself. Don't rely on the internet for your information. Go do things! The human body is awesome. Use it. Experiment to find out what works and what doesn't. You'll increase your body awareness in so many ways. **Any activity becomes creative when the doer cares about doing it right or better.** Movement can be an insanely fulfilling expression of art.
* Always keep drilling the basics. Over and over again. Can you safety vault like a pro? Great! Now make sure you can do it on both sides and control the distance you're vaulting. Work to double that distance. Now link it to two other moves. Can you do those on all sides? Can you do them barefoot at 3AM when it's pouring rain? This is what it takes to truly master a set of skills. Sure
* Innovate. Bring in aspects of your other pursuits. Cross pollination encourages growth. I'm big into skateboarding
* Keep jamming with people that are better than you. They'll push you to improve and teach you new things. Plus
* Add to the community. Are you good at video editing, being friendly, etc? Take those skills, put them toward parkour, and give back to the community so we can grow it. I can kind of write and I enjoy organizing my thoughts through writing. You get cool guides out of it. It's a win-win.
* Enjoy every second of training.
* Share your passion. People won’t retain everything you tell them
* **Subtle awesomeness is sexy.** Train for your own personal edification

**I KEEP GETTING HECKLED/PARKOUR IS TOO HARD/SOME MINOR ASPECT OF MY BEING THAT I'VE OVERJUSTIFIED AS A MAJOR LIFE ISSUE IS HOLDING ME BACK**

My team has adopted the practice of yelling ""WALKING!"" and give our best exaggerated impressions of that when passerbys try to emulate the scene in The Office and yell ""PARKOUR!"". It's super effective.
Don't be so sensitive. Yelling in passing is nothing.

Reality: Excuses don't make you feel good when you get up in the morning. Get out and do stuff. I know it's hard and you feel like everything has to be perfect for you to make the jump into something new

**How do I know how I'm doing?**

* Ask yo' buddies
* Find some [Challenge series]( http://www.reddit.com/r/Parkour/comments/x1ed8/proposal_subreddit_bimonthly_parkour_challenge/) or crazy [rail balance challenges](http://blane-parkour.blogspot.com/2012/01/1-mile-of-rail-balance.html). Better yet
* Check out this [Skill Standards Resource](http://eatmoveimprove.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/Skill-Standards.pdf)
* **Keep a training notebook!** I think this is the best idea ever and will be doing a series of resources on this practice in the near future.
* Hit up /r/ParkourTeachers . Ask questions.

**AND FINALLY!**

Personally I don't find the ""solution"" of banishing all freerunners to a separate subreddit (r/freerun) to be effective at all. New users will not understand the dynamic or will be overzealous about it

I think the real problem is not that people don't understand that a perceived difference exists. I think the problem is in essence
1) Some people (sometimes) are not interested in seeing the various innovations/integrations that we find in freerunning videos
2) Some people are disappointed that after the effort it has taken to create a dichotomy/understand the terminology

My proposition is that, we can put both of the issues described above to rest by labeling links and videos that are submitted to this site. So we could create guidelines for this subreddit (better formed guidelines should exist anyway) for placing tags on links, namely **[pk]** or **[fr]** in order to clearly demarcate what is going on. 

For now, we might want to label other things, or think of other labels and guidelines. Hopefully this can lead to a more structured, reasonably organized, self-regulating community.

1302996590.0,grqnd,Tips on dealing with security - From a security guard,yugosaki,43,2,9,"Hey

First and foremost

When dealing with the second type, not worth dealing with. Don't run, but make it clear you are leaving.

When dealing with the first type, lots of idiots like to take a swing at us) Generally the guard will just ask you to leave, and nothing more. It may be helpful to ask where the boundaries to the property are if you don't know, as encountering the same guard multiple times in a day will look really bad for you. I have had smartasses (no traceurs yet) think they were clever by just going to another part of the property, thinking they'll avoid me. If I catch the same person 3 times in the same day, I usually nail em for trespassing.

If you are in a group

In general, so being polite and complying will avoid this nastiness altogether.

DON'T RUN. If I don't know exactly what you were doing, I'll be logging your description and preserving any CCTV footage I have. If something comes up later and you happen to match the description, it could cause issues for you. If you don't run and leave quietly, I'll log the incident, but probably not the details, or bother pulling footage or anything.

Quite often we're only confronting you because we have to. Please don't give us a hard time. You'll notice training around an entrance will often get more negative attention than say, but if you're not immediately visible/""in the way"", i would be less inclined to confront, and probably won't receive complaints from people.

If someone gives me a hard time, etc) When someone is a jerk to me I don't want them anywhere near the people I'm responsible for.

It's also important to note whether you're on private or public property. I can kick you off of private property without any reason at all. Public property (depending on where you are) there generally has to be a reason to deny you access. I suggest looking up your city's bylaws governing use of public property.

Keep an eye out for signs that say ""no trespassing"" or anything like that, but (at least in my area) most guards can arrest trespassers and hand them over to police. At least according to Canadian law, it's not trespassing unless there are posted notices, you defeated a barrier (like a fence), or you are informed you are trespassing by someone.

a lot of traceurs arent as fit as they think they are, next time you're out training, map out a nice long speed run for yourself. think mirrors edge. now blast through it as fast as you can. if you're anything like the tracuers in my area, youll trace something you think is well within your fitness level, and then be surprised when your winded, or even worse, cant even finish it.

prove me wrong

&gt;Hey, figured I'd give you guys my take on it.

&gt;First and foremost

&gt;When dealing with the second type, not worth dealing with. Don't run, but make it clear you are leaving.

&gt;When dealing with the first type, lots of idiots like to take a swing at us) Generally the guard will just ask you to leave, and nothing more. It may be helpful to ask where the boundaries to the property are if you don't know, as encountering the same guard multiple times in a day will look really bad for you. I have had smartasses (no traceurs yet) think they were clever by just going to another part of the property, thinking they'll avoid me. If I catch the same person 3 times in the same day, I usually nail em for trespassing.

&gt;If you are in a group

&gt;In general, so being polite and complying will avoid this nastiness altogether.

&gt;DON'T RUN. If I don't know exactly what you were doing, I'll be logging your description and preserving any CCTV footage I have. If something comes up later and you happen to match the description, it could cause issues for you. If you don't run and leave quietly, I'll log the incident, but probably not the details, or bother pulling footage or anything.

&gt;Quite often we're only confronting you because we have to. Please don't give us a hard time. You'll notice training around an entrance will often get more negative attention than say, but if you're not immediately visible/""in the way"", i would be less inclined to confront, and probably won't receive complaints from people.

&gt;If someone gives me a hard time, etc) When someone is a jerk to me I don't want them anywhere near the people I'm responsible for.

&gt;It's also important to note whether you're on private or public property. I can kick you off of private property without any reason at all. Public property (depending on where you are) there generally has to be a reason to deny you access. I suggest looking up your city's bylaws governing use of public property.

&gt;Keep an eye out for signs that say ""no trespassing"" or anything like that, but (at least in my area) most guards can arrest trespassers and hand them over to police. At least according to Canadian law, it's not trespassing unless there are posted notices, you defeated a barrier (like a fence), or you are informed you are trespassing by someone.

&gt;Hope that helps out some,False,self,t5_2qk85,False,,,t3_opyz0

We talked about this concept a few weeks ago and I'd like to start implementing it as of today. As the updated sidebar states

Please include the tag [PK] at the beginning of your link title to mark it as a video that primarily exhibits movement that is fast, and versatile - especially in the sense of navigating environments.

Example: [\[PK\] Fun challenges in some amazing looking spots in New York](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icdEdT5Aebw)

Please include the tag [FR] to the title of video links that display parkour movements in conjunction with techniques from other disciplines, gymnastics, extreme wheelbarrowing, and others.

Example: [\[FR\] Incredible creativity and flow from Poland](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-S81VqFQ2qQ)

Of course, just downvote! Just because something has a single flip in it doesn't mean that it isn't a [PK] video. If someone posts a video that isn't tagged, feel free to remind them in the comments.

As always

Note that for now this is just for tagging video links.

* [Demon Drills](http://www.youtube.com/user/DemonDrills) - Are you looking for some exercises and conditioning patterns? Look no further!

* [Urban Current](http://www.youtube.com/user/UrbanCurrent) - Drills and Conditioning from ADAPT graduates.

* [Parkour Generations](http://www.youtube.com/user/ParkourGenerations) - Pioneer of the ADAPT certification program and led by several of the original Yamakasi. 

* [Training for Parkour](http://www.youtube.com/TrainingForParkour) - A very unique channel for conditioning and vaults for beginners and veterans alike.

* [Dogen's Conditioning tutorial](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyQQFzP2H2s) - A tutorial all about conditioning and getting your body to respond how you want it too.

* [Dogen's ankle conditioning tutorial](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDbnMKhIuA0&amp;feature=results_video&amp;playnext=1&amp;list=PL82D269EDFCAA7F75) - I think everyone should watch this because it definitely will prevent unnecessary injuries in the future.

* [Landing tutorial](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49qszULPvpM) - This video will teach you how to properly land so that you preserve forward momentum into a roll.

* [Rolling technique](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6I1J0zmE7U) - Understanding how to roll and different ways you can roll effectively is one of the most important parts of parkour. Seriously

* [Dogen's Blocking tutorial](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsg1Xak07jI) - If you want to get much more height with your tricking/flips watch this tutorial on Blocking.

* [Epic's Tutorials](http://www.youtube.com/user/Epic1) - Another resource for a large list of tricking tutorials.

* [Jesse LeFlair's tutorials](http://www.youtube.com/user/LaFlairParkour) - A seasoned traceur/freerunner who has been successful on Ninja Warrior. Learn firsthand by his technique and lessons.

This thread is a discussion thread too! If you have any concerns, please feel free too. I hope this will help many on their journey of free movement.

Hi my fellow traceurs, IMO most of traceurs here dont smoke, however there are some who do (lets say 20%) . However, there are quiet lot people who do drink alcohol regularly. Or more accuratly, i know only few guys who dont drink alcohol at all (like me). So, i would say 80-90% of traceurs here drink alcohol. But know comes the funny thing. Marijuana usage. In czech alone, we have pretty big cannabis culture. I think some researches claim that we are the number one in cannabis use of young people in Europe. So there is a lot of people who smoke like few times a month, i think that there is 15-20% of traceurs who smoke few times a week (including me). Then about 50% who smoke rarely and the rest are people who dont smoke at all and/or think cannabis is dangerous. Those people who smoke regularly

**Notable Threads from the Past Week**: 

Get an idea what's been going on this week!

* **TOP NEWS** [/r/parkour moderator nominations are now open!](http://redd.it/1f7ssq) Make sure you head over there to see the direction the subreddit is heading and put in your two cents. This matters people. Vote!

* [Should /r/Parkour remove downvotes?](http://www.reddit.com/r/Parkour/comments/1f55ay/discussion_post_please_upvote_should_we_keep/).

* This digs slightly into last week's treasure trove

* [The good old ""What shoes do I wear?"" thread showed up near the beginning of the week.](http://redd.it/1ey4aw)  Not a particularly auspicious start to the week

* /u/lTlonster nailed his first [gainers](http://redd.it/1eztfp) this week **and** posted a nifty gif of his doing so. Make sure to give him some props for mastering a tricky move!

* [This](http://redd.it/1f267q) video about Parkour practitioners in Spain didn't get much love

* A short discussion cropped up mid week about [refining front flips](http://redd.it/1f2q2r). There's always traceurs that are going to shun them from their training, you know they look pretty awesome and learning them is an excellent way to gain aerial awareness.

* A thread by /u/PepsiSpice confirmed [what the world already knew](http://redd.it/1f3q9d).  Some people occasionally train parkour by themselves.

* Omar Zaki of Impulse Freerunning posted this [sweet video](http://redd.it/1f9s3r) of freerunning in Dubai. This is right after a  nifty video of him [solo training in a local gym](http://redd.it/1f546y). Support the smaller name traceurs

* A recent thread that could use some love about [backyard workouts](http://redd.it/1f7yr9) discusses some equipment you could build yourself to train on.

* Go compare scars in [this thread about common injuries](http://redd.it/1f8wig)

* Check out Beast Coast 2013 via [these images](http://redd.it/1f9qhv).

* Darn it

1365329653.0,1buhic,I made a new subreddit that could include quite a bit of parkour and free running,,29,6,7,"I'm subscribed to many of the major sports subreddits and I just recently subscribed here. I've found the videos or highlights to be some of my favorite content

I'm just learning about parkour and I don't know much background. I'm looking to feature it pretty prominently on the subreddit because it takes so much physical skill. 

So basically my idea is to get the best parkour videos or the best videos from any sport really and to group them all into one subreddit. I'm looking to make a Sportcenter Top 10 but with a lot more content and from a lot more sources. I've posted everything from monster dunks to free diving and I'm looking to include more parkour. 

The concept is to find a cool video

Feedback is appreciated so let me know what you think. ",self,t5_2qk85,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/Parkour/comments/1buhic/i_made_a_new_subreddit_that_could_include_quite_a/

* Are you training with longevity in mind? Has that even ever occurred to you? /u/kellock71 shares his [thoughts on the matter](http://redd.it/1iuftf). Highly recommended read.
* The [71-year old freerunner](http://redd.it/1itosk) is a big deal this week. for good reason. Glad to see more quality content coming from the FLOW network. Definitely keeping up with them.
* Dodo Freerunning is fast becoming one of my favorite teams to follow. [Check out their latest and greatest](http://redd.it/1iwoio) and feel a little jealous of their skills.
* Ampisound is still at it with their video challenge. [Check out their recent video

**SO HERE'S THE DEAL**: This is going to be similar to the previous call for FAQuestions, submit a top level comment in this thread. Only one question per comment. PLEASE check to see that the question has not been asked yet. I will remove repeated questions, etc. Upvote if you agree that this is a question that needs to be answered - particularly if it will be helpful to beginners. And honestly, ""what kind of shoes should I wear"" is a more useful question than ""what are the finer points of distinction between extreme freerunning and ultimate no-limits rage froobling"". Keep in mind that FAQs are for beginners.

**AND THEN** if you have an answer to these questions, upvote it. There can be many answers to these questions, and that's okay. It's not like anyone is really an ""expert"" on parkour, it's a growing, developing community of practitioners.

**CAVEAT** This FAQ thread is NOT the place for discussion. If you have an opposing view, and that will be enforced arbitrarily.

Let's get to this week!

**This Week [Abridged]**

* My favorite article from this week was posted by /u/Joecracko. [Are playgrounds becoming too safe?](http://redd.it/1jkcai). Definitely worth the read.

* /u/h4cklusser posted up his [weekly challenge entry](http://redd.it/1jkw9n) from last week. Keep upvoting this kind of stuff

* We had a lot of shoe threads this week. I'm not gracing those with any quick links here.

* I had never heard of Ido Portal before [this thread](http://redd.it/1jny5i). Honestly, so to each his own.

* /u/Apathyveteran has been doing this cool [Weekly training discussion threads](http://redd.it/1jp2st). Keep following those for some general community stoke.

* Self conscious around more experience traceurs? [It's a pretty common feeling](http://redd.it/1jp422). I liken it to imposter syndrome in graduate students.
 
* /u/personofdoom shared his part of an article for [a local newspaper](http://redd.it/1jpvf5).

* /u/donkeydicksrule also [got a last minute entry in](http://redd.it/1jt08w) for the Weekly Challenge 1. He opened himself up for some technical critiques

* **Weekly Challenge #2 is out** [Go try your hand at it](http://redd.it/1jt6zl) and post up your results.

* A thread about hand strength ended up becoming a [great resource on grip strength conditioning](http://redd.it/1ju0pf).

* /u/ApathyVeteran keeps rocking the great question

* [Calories burned during parkour?](http://redd.it/1jxbcs) The thread didn't get a response

**As always**

This thread is a judgement free zone for new-ish traceurs to ask all those questions they're wary of making a new thread for.

This can serve as a discussion thread for your experiences.

I'll sum up what I've learned through experimentation:

Disclaimer right away - no noises. Never suck in air or push it out with ""conscious force"" (lacking a better term).

Out: Breathing out means relaxing the core. It's crucial for impacts and helpful in explosive movements of all kinds

In: In order to breathe in the core becomes tense. This helps you control your limbs while in the air. Caution: Always stop breathing in *well* before an impact or you will be too tense.",self,t5_2qk85,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/Parkour/comments/xixrm/breathing/

This novel is narrated by various characters (excepting only the main character, you'll write a chapter from a novel in which parkour plays a big role. You're not writing the entire novel (unless you want to), just a single chapter in it, where your hero(es) come to Frederick, MD and meet a local freerunning legend. It will be a challenge, because you'll need to write a chapter that's interesting in its own right but also implies that there's a wider story going on.

Some of the chapters in this novel are transformed into a different genre, cyberpunk or steampunk themed as well, that's doable. I realize that's a little odd, but it gives you more creative freedom in some ways.

Post your picture in the subreddit titled ""Challenge 1: -whatever you like-"". I'll find them all and link them in a giant post at the end of the week. Will there be a prize? Well

this week

- do 100 precision at 80% of your max distance with minimal breaks

- plan a long route with at least 8 obstacles and run it in one go

- or

for those of you who are just starting out and would rather a more practical challenge this week

- do a turn vault to cat

this sounds a lot more complicated than it actually is. the trick is to break it down into 3 parts (1.turn to cat 2. cat 180 3. shoulder roll) and master each one on its own

- turn vault
