----

I got rid of the downvote arrows (for posts only) because people were downvoting OC. People who worked hard collecting data

One of the fundamental tenets of [reddiquette](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette#wiki_please__don.27t)  is ""don't downvote just because you don't like something"".  If you think a post is ugly

## Don't Downvote. Report!

If a post breaks one of the rules

Only report a post if it breaks the rules.

## What to do about bad data/analysis

There is a legitimate question about what to do about bad data or bad analysis.  [Egregious example](http://i.imgur.com/5O0Zewc.jpg). This issue is open for discussion. My thought is that the benefit of limiting downvotes everywhere outweighs the cost of allowing downvotes for these cases. Concerns about data or analysis would be best expressed by a comment.

## Guide to a great post

**Edit 2:** I said this in a comment, but no one has reported it, I'm always confused. Even if this is temporary and serves only to remind people about reporting, that's a positive outcome.

About a year and a half ago I launched the site [ThermostatMonitor.com](http://thermostatmonitor.com/) to track the usage of a WiFi enabled thermostat produced by Radio Thermostat.  Since then I've also started an open source thermostat project

When people sign up, when each cycle started and stopped and what the inside and outside temperatures were at the time.

There is quite a bit of data available now and I'm sure it's useful

**EDIT:**  Several people have asked for this data to be consolidated instead of a separate set of files for each thermostat.  I have provided that [here](http://thermostatmonitor.com/csv/export.zip).

**1. The message at the top has been phrased a little more respectfully. I don't at all agree that you should be subscribed

I was thinking about subscribing to this subreddit-- I love the posts and the ideas-- but a few things really drove me nuts.

First of all

&gt;You are not a member of this community. Please respect that by not commenting.

Excuse me? That, just because I haven't clicked a button, I'm not authorized (or am somehow disrespecting the sub) to comment? And when I do, I suddenly am respectful enough to leave an intelligent comment? Why does this apply to a subreddit like /r/dataisbeautiful, but not a subreddit where quality is very important like /r/askscience?

Another thing that really drove me up the wall was that the mods hid the ""message the moderators"" link. Of course

To submit this, even though they do it themselves [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/1bil7d/dataisbeautiful_the_source_matters/) and [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/18904g/why_no_downvote_arrows_please_upvote_for/), that mod himself violating both reddiquette and intergalactic law by asking for upvotes even though they don't give karma in self posts.

Don't get me wrong, even on joke or ""trolly"" subreddits).

###Only post original sources
All posts need to cite the author or original source. It doesn't matter where YOU first saw it.  You need to find the actual source. That source is never gawker or tumbler. Try to figure out where THEY got it from. There's usually a link somewhere. Also try [Google's search by image](http://www.google.com/insidesearch/features/images/searchbyimage.html).  

###But I don't know the source
If you really can't find it

###How do I make a well sourced post?
Several options:

1. Post a link to the web site (not an image on the site
1. Add a comment with the source
1. The author's name or website is written on the submitted image
1. Add [OC] to the title if you made it (original content)

\#1 is important. Don't post a link to an image on another site (e.g. Wikipedia) without more info. It needs to be possible to find out who made the visualization.

Example:  
[unsourced (bad)](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/54/Rayleigh-Taylor_instability.jpg)  
[original source (good)](https://wci.llnl.gov/codes/visit/gallery_02.html)

###Before you make a post…
Read the sidebar and the FAQ. Not just here. Do this before submitting to any subreddit.

###This sub has gone downhill!
It's only been 6 days. Give the new subscribers another week to get acclimatized. We had a few users submitting lots of shit
The situation is improving, and let's see how this plays out. If the situation is still bad in a week, we have several options we're considering. In the mean time, please spend a bit of time in [/new](/r/dataisbeautiful/new?sort=new).

Alright so here's all the results from [this survey by WoundedLeprechaun](http://www.reddit.com/r/hockey/comments/1bv098/team_fandom_survey/)

**Basics**

* The survey lasted 5 days and there were 1145 responses.
* The average respondent loves 1.61 teams, dislikes 5.50 teams and hates 3.74 teams
* The average team had 61.37 loves, 209.80 dislikes and 142.77 hates.
* No one hated every team but their own (but a few people were pretty close)

**The Score**

I gave a Love response 2pts, Dislike -1pt and Hate -2pts, then for each team this was added together and averaged into a final score.  In addition each person who took the survey had their score calculated (add together all their responses/30).

* Average respondent score was -0.13
* Lowest respondent score was -1.73
* Highest respondent score was 0.87
* 791 people had negative scores
* 299 people had positive scores
* 55 people had a score of zero
* 7 teams scored positively: Jets, Oil, Jackets, Avs and Hawks
   * The highest of which was CBJ with 0.41 (best team liked
* 22 teams scored negatively
   * The lowest of which was Boston with -0.59 (worst overall opinion
* 1 team scored zero: Ducks
* From all the scores a [fan positivity chart](http://i.imgur.com/38EdsLa.png) was made...good news!  We're all a bunch of negative bastards!  No team's fans had an overall positive score
   * All opinions but those of the fan's own team were included
   * The least negative fans were the Bolts and the Jets both with -0.07
   * The most negative fans were the Kings with -0.34

**Rivalries**

Continuing with the score

* [Here's the chart](http://i.imgur.com/2w19Gd8.png)
   * Negative scores are red
   * There were a few people who said they rooted for a team, but in the end they were (it doesn't really affect the data overall)
* [The two teams' scores were then added to one another to create a rivalry chart.](http://i.imgur.com/q99BsAz.png)
   * The idea here was if two teams really hated each other they would have a more negative combined score and bigger rivalry
   * Less than -2 is black (biggest rivalry), more than 0 light green, more than 1 dark green (friendliest teams).
   * Surprise!  The biggest rivalry was Flyers/Pens (-3.85), PHX/LAK (-3.51) and Bos/Van (-3.45).
   * Apparently everyone loves Winnipeg because they had as many scores over 1 as the rest of the league combined (4 - Calgary
* Then the [differences between what 2 teams thought of one another](http://i.imgur.com/SnHNDmm.png) was charted (absolute value of their scores subtracted)
   * Everyone has 0 in their own column because it was their score - their score = 0
   * If there was a difference of great than 1 is was colored red
   * Boston and Vancouver both had 4 discrepancies of over 1

**The Charts**

*Quick note: I gave 2 example charts and asked what people liked the most in a previous post

**All horizontal stacked charts are in percentages

Overall:

* [Number of responses per team](http://i.imgur.com/ubaQFGQ.png)
* [Stacked Chart](http://i.imgur.com/e9D04HE.png) showing overall response
   * [Sorted by Love](http://i.imgur.com/jobbAB2.png) - Pittsburgh is the most loved team

   * [Sorted by Indifference](http://i.imgur.com/aVbCpGV.png)
   * [Sorted by Dislike+hate](http://i.imgur.com/ZSr6uMP.png)
   * [Sorted by Hate](http://i.imgur.com/USCpcWH.png) - Pittsburgh is also the most hated team
   * [Sorted by Score](http://i.imgur.com/zY2QMpg.png) (highest score is highest up on the chart

* [Just the raw numbers](http://i.imgur.com/FNDvzAx.png) and by [Percentage](http://i.imgur.com/3nDKPvC.png)

Fan Charts:

**There are a fuck-ton of charts per team, one's a vertical bar (raw numbers) and the other is a horizontal stacked (percentages), and finally there's 2 for the league (same idea as with the conferences).**
