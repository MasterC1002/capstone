Or instead I'll get so frustrated in the Starbucks line that I'm two minutes from screaming and attacking everyone for being so fucking stupid.  When I'm depressed, I lay in bed for hours and cry and fantasize about suicide.  The only plans I can make are to kill myself.  I have dozens of drafts of suicide notes lying around.

I will also tell this new therapist that I've been hallucinating for almost two years now.  I've only told one other person because of the stigma and because it's solid evidence that I'm slowly and surely losing my mind.  

I won't tell anyone where I've gone, because I'm a staple in that activity.

/r/bipolar has been on a bit of a downward spiral the past 3 months. For those of you that don't know me I took the sub over 7 months ago and drastically changed it from a completely dead subreddit with 200ish people in to the success it is now. We did this by being different

This is currently not working anymore. Posts are becoming mundane and repetitive

*So

* No more posting for diagnosis

* No more posting about medication help

* No more posting about anything that your doctor should be handling

Basically, a fun area. You get the drift. We are not doctors, or physicians. It is a community to get to know each other, have fun, talk, discuss, post pictures, stories

To help enforce this I am enlisting several of my assistant mods and promoting them to fully fledged moderators of the sub. I am bored of seeing posts that do not belong here

Remember, you will see what does well in the sub and what type of posts are welcome. It is that simple. 

Hoping that the new Mods will introduce themselves and add to this the changes and help they will also make in the sub in regards to making it a better and safer place

Self posts are still welcome just save the medical and rant stuff etc for your doctor

Much love

The mood swings are like a roller coaster. Like roller coasters, the highs and lows are unpredictable as you're whipped around and pass through dark tunnels, all the while hearing the supports creaking. And some are so fast and turn you upside down so many times that it's completely disorienting and you are shaking by the time you've completed a lap. Sometimes, you feel no support under your feet, which reinforces the ever-present fear that all of the safety measures could fail, and you'll fall to your death. There are those precious times when the track is flat and you're fine (euthymia), but it doesn't necessarily last long, seeing everything around you from an enlightened perspective, racing out of control, or if you'll ever reach those same heights. There's no end to the ride. You can only pray that you can stay on a flat stretch for as long as possible and that maybe

There are several disorders on the bipolar spectrum: bipolar I (manic episodes, bipolar NOS (doesn't fit criteria for type I or type II). I am diagnosed with bipolar type II, so I can't explain what mania feels like, but I'll tell what I can.

(Hypo)mania feels a lot like an ecstasy roll that lasts for days or weeks. It's exhilarating but eventually exhausting

Hypomanic episodes can feel great - elevated mood, great productivity, more social energy. Everything is wonderful. Everything is possible. Everyone is good. This can lead to some poor judgment calls. Risky sex, purchases, and gambling all seem like great ideas when ""nothing can go wrong"". This feels great at the time, but once you return to a normal mood, you look back and realize exactly how ridiculous it was and wonder how in the hell you thought that wasn't a stupid decision.

Hypomanic episodes can also feel awful, family, and friends. You need less sleep, since you're buzzing with negative energy. You make impulsive decisions, but they're fueled by irritability, not optimism.

And then comes the fall. I've heard that the higher the (hypo)mania, it's true. Once your mood has dipped, you look back at the high and realize you were wrong about how great it was, which exacerbates your slide into depression. It's awful because something great can elevate you into (hypo)mania, but looking back, you're jaded about the whole experience, since you know your judgment was off at the time.

Anyone who's been depressed knows how awful it is. No willpower to get out of bed. No desire to do anything or see anyone. No hope for the future. Feeling worthless. Feeling numb. Unable to concentrate and get anything done. Feeling unworthy of anything good.

Bipolar II is depression-heavy, it's virtually guaranteed that you'll end up down here again.

These inconsistent moods, but there's still a strong stigma against bipolar, so it's not something most people want to admit. Even if they know, you are just so unstable. Supporting a friend through depression after depression is a lot of work. People are charmed by the hypomanic you, but that person can disappear for months on end.

Since hypomania is rarely recognized by patients, and hopelessly depressed over and over again. There are often stimuli that spark the mood swings, but the reaction is far overblown. You see yourself as ridiculously overdramatic but don't understand why.

The diagnosis is a double-edged sword. It's a relief to hear a reason why you've had so many issues in the past and that there are ways to help, and it definitely doesn't feel fabulous to share this problem with people who are well-known.

I was just recently diagnosed, I'm taking 200 mg of Lamictal. The pill is huge, about 1 cm in diameter. Every single night, seeing that I've got mental issues severe enough to warrant having to take this pill just makes me sad, especially since I will have to take it every single day for the rest of my life.

The worst thing to me is that I'm afraid to do anything that will make me too happy because I don't know how many more deep depressions I can withstand. After all,False,self,t5_2qnv4,False,,,t3_187cz9

It is important that if you think you may have Bipolar disorder or any other mental illness you seek a professional. 


[Self-diagnosis](http://www.livestrong.com/article/265651-what-are-the-dangers-of-self-diagnosis/) is prone to error and may be potentially dangerous if inappropriate decisions are made on the basis of a misdiagnosis. Because of the risks, and patient care organizations. Even physicians are discouraged from engaging in self-diagnosis, because doctors too make mistakes in diagnosing themselves. If the self-diagnosis is wrong, then the misdiagnosis can result in improper health care, including wrong treatments and lack of care for serious conditions.

It is important that you know that no one here is qualified to diagnose you including yourself. We can and will offer support from a place of experience. Everyone is still encouraged to post and ask for local resources as we may have missed some below

_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

**How to get Treatment:** (after getting a diagnosis)

* Contact a licensed Psychologist in your area - waiting lists maybe long and you may have to call around to find a doctor that has openings for new patients that will take you soon. If you have access to a database of doctors in your insurance network online this is a big help (it really helped me out). 


* Document any changes that you can recall in your moods or behavior- the initial visit may seem daunting if you have never been in therapy before and having everything documented can help the psychologist and you a great deal.


* Be aware of family history- Some mental illnesses have a tendency to be prominent in families


* Keep a mood diary for the days or week(s) up to your appointment.- There are some that provide integration with smartphones and desktops 
	* http://www.findingoptimism.com/ - Desktop and mobile
	* https://www.facingus.org/
	* http://www.mymoodtracker.com/ - mobile app only

* Once you have seen your Psychologist you may also see a Psychiatrist who can provide medication. For some of us

 For others medication is not what is desired. Either way
	
* For those of you that decide to take medication...**PLEASE DO NOT ADJUST OR STOP TAKING YOUR MEDICATION WITHOUT CONSULTING YOUR PSYCHIATRIST!**. If you are about to run out of medication

 [From buzzfeed.com](http://www.buzzfeed.com/whitneyjefferson/nick-cannon-wrote-an-open-letter-to-amanda-bynes) 

""As we all know I do interviews every single day about all my various projects, my album, my stand-up special, NCredible consumer products, and various philanthropic and charitable efforts. Usually during these interviews I am consistently questioned about my wife, my kids, and my health and I happily answer them all. But as of lately I have been hit with an onslaught of questions about someone I consider family, and someone I genuinely feel is one of the most pleasant human beings I have had the pleasure of meeting

The questions have ranged from, but one must know how to navigate through the matrix or you may find yourself in a very dark hole.

When a person is told all of their life that they are awesome, teachers, and employers NEVER telling you NO. Anything you ask for or want, the world gives you, at some point you are bound to self-destruct. I call this “access to excess”. I’ve seen it happen to many of my friends and colleagues young and old. It goes back to that old saying; “Too much of anything is bad for anyone”. Whether it’s fame, money, sex, attention. It’s all a dangerous addiction. When there is no balance in your life a person will always become victim to their reality or lack thereof. The question is, manic, that tissue is under INTENSE heat with nowhere to escape but once you place a magnifying glass over that tissue

We say things like, “See what fame and money does to people”. And most of the time your assumptions and accusations maybe accurate but also inappropriate. No one on this planet needs to be judged or even has the right to judge. We are all equal and we all have our downfalls, fame or no fame. Money or no money. Life is hard for everyone in some since. And we need each other to in times of despair. No one can make it through anything alone. So I ask people who are quick to judge, tweet, report, or comment to ask yourself; what if that person was my sister? My brother? My Mother? Or me? What then would I say? In the words of the great poet and artist Bill Withers, 'Sometimes in our lives We all have pain
So I say to my sister Amanda Bynes you’re not alone. I’m here for you. I understand. I care and I appreciate you, the hand you’re helping up today may be the one you’re reaching for tomorrow. So not to be all cheesy and over sentimental but I got to end this with the ingenious Wither’s lyrics 'Lean on me when you’re not strong and I’ll be your friend, I’ll help you carry on. For it won’t be long until I’ll need somebody to lean on.'""",,False,self,t5_2qnv4,,http://www.reddit.com/r/bipolar/comments/1jqnv3/i_thought_this_open_letter_to_amanda_bynes_was/

----------------

Somewhere, but I don't know anymore. I tried to die, I didn't, and I only feel better for intermittent periods. I feel so unsure of myself. The few friends I do make, I alienate due to self doubt. It's horrifying to look at your life, this lonely, flighty, and know that it's your fault and you're not going to get any better. That's what I'm beginning to realize now that I've left home. I can run from my problems

It's wonderful when you feel yourself being effortlessly pulled out of the sickening, productive, outgoing person you are when manic? The anxious, lethargic, self doubting person you are when depressed? The absurd, melancholic, creative person when having a mixed episode? There's no sense of identity, disconnected memories that you try desperately to escape and forget.

I'm just so tired. All the time

There's such a disconnect within myself. I am brave and terrified, because it changes so effortlessly and absolutely. I have no personality and no real life. I make and lose friends easily. 

I'm lonely, what makes me feel accepted, is when we're honest about these feelings. I finally feel like I'm not crazy. 

Sometimes I feel so lonely that I cry and pull my hair out in clumps. I feel like the proper type of crazy you'd always understood as a child. The poster boy of mental illness. But when I read what people say here, and we'll never know each other, but you all have saved my life by letting me feel at least a little bit normal. I just have to get this all out there. I have to give back what I've gleaned from this sub, or I haven't learned anything at all.

We're different

I wasn’t skinny enough to have full-blown anorexia, with bursts of what looked like a drug-induced high. I didn’t even try illegal drugs until after my release, which was a miracle unto itself.

I felt like a failure. I didn’t know what I was doing. I didn’t succeed in my anorexia

I was put on some medication that my later doctor couldn’t believe was prescribed for me. It did nothing but exacerbate the disorder. I was smoking frequently, all of who knew about hospital. They didn’t bother to keep in touch. I was dealing with too much to put in the effort for them, and as a result, I had only one friend. Even he didn’t fully know where I was medically.

I later learned that admission to a mental institution for anything other than a traditional eating disorder is a scar you can never take off your record. A mental disorder is socially stigmatized and taboo. My time in hell was brushed off as “that time I was in hospital

It’s times like these that I wish I had cancer instead. At least then it would be real, because it’s a real thing.

A mental illness

People as a whole don’t seem to understand that mental illness is just as bad as physical illness. You can’t always control your behavior. You have to see doctors just as often. But what makes it worse is that you can’t tell anyone. You can’t pitifully say “I have diabetes” or “I’ve got lupus”. You have to suck it up and pretend like everything’s fine all the time

While I was in hell

You’ve probably noticed I don’t treat the hospital I was in with a lot of respect. It’s because I don’t respect it as a medical institution. What kind of place doesn’t let patients in critical condition see a doctor every day? There’s a reason every one of us was in that place
I consider myself lucky that I got into the second best school in the US for my major. I had to tell every place I applied to that I’m damaged goods. I couldn’t say I won’t succumb to major depression again. I still eat less than 700 calories a day. And I can’t say for certain that any of the friends I might make are going to know about my conditions.

I run a blog, but I’m already at 600 calories for the day so I can’t eat anything.” The time I had a five-hour absolute meltdown gets brushed off as “nothing really interesting happening”.

I probably shouldn’t be, waiting for the day I’ll grow up and take them. I can’t. I just can’t. The feeling of pills being stuck in your throat is the worst, and the one’s I’m on always get stuck. But I’m off them because I can’t bear to be dependent on pills. I want to know that I’m mentally okay enough to crack it on my own.

But the part that gets me is that I don’t think I am. The five-hour ordeal and two-day aftermath happened after I stopped. I’m sobbing as I’m writing this. I don’t have the energy to do anything other than sleep and look at simple things on the internet. I’m angry with people a lot

For me, I have no desire for sleep or food. My eyes are opened wider and my senses feel heightened. Remarkably jovial and talkative, talkative to the point of interrupting sometimes, I feel like I need to comment on everything. Those closest to me say they like me hypomanic, but they are more than ready for me to calm down. Hypomania creates a caricature of myself. Invincible. Bigger than life.

One benefit of hypomania for me is productivity. Once my boundless energy is bridled, papers are filed, and exciting new lessons are developed. I never slow down and neither do my students. For middle schoolers, a hypomanic teacher is quite a treat. I talk a mile a minute, cracking jokes and pacing about the room, and we bounce from one activity to the next. Not many papers get graded, and tangential thoughts may invade my lessons, my hypomania, is a bit dangerous, there was no fall out from that evening. No parent complaints

At home, since I see no reason why everyone can't unload all of their clothes from their dressers and get organized too. My hypomania once even inspired me to paint my office. Now that was a mistake. Not only did I choose a yellow the shade of an egg yolk, I painted with such unfocused energy and lack of precision that once completed, it looked as though the sun crashed into the corner of my house and splattered all over my office walls. Needless to say, I had to hire my ex-husband to come and repaint it. Talk about humiliating.

One of the most prominent symptoms of my hypomania is this incredible urge to create something and follow it through to completion to the exclusion of anything else. For example, I will not get up unless I am forced to by the demands of family or work. Even then, while begrudgingly meeting my commitments, I feel a magnetic force pulling me back to the piano. It takes all my strength to fight it. Confession: there have been days where I have gone to work and instead of going straight to my classroom to prepare for the day, I've snuck into the music room and spent my half hour prep time playing the piano before the music teacher arrives. Being creative becomes my primary focus. Then, on those same music mania days, I will return to the music room during my free period and see if the piano is available. Again

Being hypomanic has its benefits but it certainly has its downsides too. The biggest negative hypomania brings is the dread of its inevitable end. We know it won't last forever, right? We are invincible!

 No matter what the current reasearch states regarding positive results

  There is also well monitored quality control from manufactures when making any product.  The person who made the MDMA probably isn't sure of the purity (dose) and the person giving it to you has no real idea at all what they might be handing out.  Knowing purity isn't even an option from some undergrad  chemist who read an on-line instruction and thought they might try their skills at making it.

 When it comes to your health taking a chance is not about the risk its whats at stake.  The chance that someone may completely bug out and do something dangerous is too high to take a chance.

  People making these posts are obviously not medically trained and if they were would not be blindly recommending someone try it. There is a reason medical training is so in depth and takes so long.

If you were foolish enough to try it and had a good time

It was hard for him to admit that he is bipolar at first, the only choice I have in hands is to learn more about this disease.

After discussing on methods, its going better and better and I can see how hard he is trying. For example when we were in argument and I'll usually give him some time to digest his own outbreak, he used to ignore me for a day or two but now he calls back within 1 hour time to apologize and ask how he can be better. 

I dont know if im doing right, very well!! he snap out of anger or depress mode once he realize hes out of norm and tell me he is sorry. He's afraid that I will leave because he knew it will be hell for me if my choice is to stand by him till we are old. I honestly cant give any promises but whoever out there that have a bipolar partner.. PLEASE DONT GIVE UP ON THEM. 

It was never their choice from the beginning to be entwined with this disease. I can't speak for all, patience and strong will is the only way to survive this. Believe me when I say, seeing how hard he strive to be better, makes EVERY pain i went through, worth it. I dont know about forever, I can just try my best for him, for us and hopefully he dont give up on himself.

Anyways. In the two years I've been on a downward spiral. With the exception of my few days of hypomania, do projects, or anything. I just gave up. I spent a lot of days sleeping and a lot of nights laying in bed. 

The other day I decided I was going to clean my room. So I did. The next day I invited my boyfriend over to watch movies, cleaned up after dinner, switched my laundry etc. After he left, I tidied up, did my full bed time routine, and crawled into bed at a nice 11:30pm.

1) We tend to isolate ourselves from others.

Because we fuck up. Over and over and over. Usually in big ways that freak people out if we are around them long enough. Which in turn becomes just too damn painful to make socialization worthwhile.

2) When we fuck up, deep hole of depression.

And when we slide into that depression
Perched on our shoulder, we have more to feel generally horrible about. And obsess about. Especially when we think ""Fuck, this *is not me! This is not what I do!* But, we did it, and there's no hiding from the fact. And because we know, *we know*, that no matter how great or how stable we may be feeling now, ultimately

That simply won't do.

To hell with this illness. More importantly

I have to fight with everything I have. My life will not become better until I'm willing to bleed to make it happen. And I will tell you now

So, endure it, and grow stronger. Because there is no other option. I have exhausted all other possibilities. The choice is to stay in the pit or climb out of it. 

Self-pity is worthless. Tonight I saw what comes from giving up. I got a good close look. I saw the horror, no hope, no love, no purpose. Just self-pity. Self-hate. Resignation. *Poison* for blood, *poison* in her mind. And it gets into your skin like second-hand smoke.

I also saw what comes from endurance. My father, I saw faith, I saw love. No self-pity. No writhing in pain. Quiet acceptance. He stares his demons in the eye without fear while doing his work, because *that's what you do* if you want to make anything out of life. And despite all he carries every day, he *still enjoys life.*

Even as a child my brain knew it was bipolar. It understood the works of other bipolar people and collected them. I recognized like minded people - those who are 'emotionally action packed'! How soul crushing was the moment I acknowledged it. Bipolar is classified a mental illness. To own the term meant to own that I am mentally ill. It meant waking up to considering that 'my people' are the mentally ill people. No. No. This will not do, they say, is your true self. So, I must look in the mirror and tell myself that I am only able to be truly me if I take this medication every day. My medicated self. Well fine then world. I will compromise and medicate, but in exchange I ask that you stop associating cruel stigmatic words with mental illness and medication, for it is soul crushing. It is being bullied every day by an entire society. It will no longer do. This is my civil rights movement. Stop talking about us as this **disabled** stigma of mentall illness, start seeing us **Differently Able'd**

Introspective - While depressed we manage to block out the world and it gives us time to examine our thoughts and feelings which we would may otherwise not have time for. I've found that during an episode I've had very different and interesting view on things like life
Depressive realism - allows us to no longer see the world through positive illusions and gives us a more realistic view of reality. When the whole world was appeasing Hitler only the manic depressive Churchill knew he couldn't be reasoned with and prepared for war.
Empathy - Our experience of depression lets us understand a very common illness which effects 1/4 of the population. I've found that my experiences of depression have helped me built stronger relationships with people who have went through grief or depression and even people who have helped me through my depressions.
self-image - Going from the grandiose delusions of mania to the self critical hatred of depression allows us to built up a better picture how we really see ourself and how we relate to the rest of the world. Now when I'm feeling low about my appearance I just tell myself its just my perspective of things

Overall I find mania and depression illuminates the whole human experience giving us a whole range of thoughts of emotions the world just could not perceive.

Being Bi polar, or Cyclothymia, it can be awful. We have ups, where we can think straight, and we can't reason. We have downs, where the world is a horrid place. Some of us have hallucinations, some of us hear things. 

A lot of us have tried to run, sex and drugs, but honestly, none of it works.

We are unique, we have something rare, we have a safe place to talk, somewhere where people know how it feels, and won't judge what has been said, or what has been tried.  

Here we can feel accepted, because here we are loved. 

To start, and shown acceptance, and just through that action alone, I can see how we can all change our lives.

But at that point, who with maybe the right combination of therapy and meds might not be dead or in jail and who might still be remembered as a person (i.e. most recently Adam Lanza and James Holmes).  

You might be thinking the American healthcare system is to blame, the dialogue has to change.  How do you think marijuana was legalized in 2 states--the dialogue changed.

So let's start talking.  I'm bipolar

I bought it right after my first major meltdown a few years ago.  I'd drive for hours and hours going nowhere in particular to clear my head.


Last night I swung into a deep depression and needed someone to talk to, someone to sit with me.  I couldn't think of a soul in the world.  I've cut ties with everyone that i'd ever considered a friend (they weren't my friend, I was their friend).  I'm too anxious to leave the house to meet anyone.  My family worries too much about me as it is, so I can't let out any darkness to them.  I got in my car, filled the tank, and drove 130 miles, at midnight


During that drive I realized that no matter how bad I feel, eager to go on an adventure. Always been there to console me.  It's my best and only true friend.  Statistically we'll die together.  I [cranked the stereo](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hh8YuLGHgfI) and bawled.  I don't cry, ever, so this was rare.  I couldn't stop.

**Ideal diagnosis process** (assuming you weren't hospitalized

1. ""Help

2. Go to primary care physician and get tested for physical problems. (Do not ask for psych meds

3. Fix whatever comes up on those tests. Retest to confirm success.

4. If that's not sufficient

5. If psychologist says ""bipolar""

6. If second opinion is also bipolar

7. Find good psychologist and seek treatment while continuing to see psychiatrist.

8. Chart your moods daily. Give charts to psychologist and psychiatrist regularly.

9. Get support. 

10. Go forth and be happy :)

**""I want a natural cure"" / ""I'm not happy with my treatment"" process:**

1. Keep taking your meds. Don't taper yourself. Withdrawal is a bitch

2. Go to a general practitioner and get tests for physical problems.

3. Address physical problems. Retest to confirm success.

4. Get a good psychologist if you don't have one. (Not a psychiatrist. They're different.)

5. Chart your moods daily. Give charts to psychologist and psychiatrist regularly.

6. When you're more stable

7. Get support. 

8. Go forth and be happy :)

Now for things that can look like bipolar but arent.

**Antidepressants - Yes
Did you have a manic episode? Did you start taking antidepressants recently? Are you on antidepressants alone? Antidepressants can cause manic episodes in people who aren't bipolar. They can also trigger bipolar disorder in formerly healthy people

1371553300.0,1gkt8a,My girlfriend is almost 13 weeks into a manic episode [story time],spatula_man,25,1,26,"Here we go... and before I start explaining all of this


Backstory: we've been together for 8 years (since we were 18 and 20) and I can't stress the fact we had a beautiful relationship enough. It was like out of the movies... the first day we hit it off, and until everything happened recently, our love for each other grew on a daily basis. The longest we went without talking once during the day in our eight years was two days, and it was sad for both of us. I think we had four days total that we didn't talk at least once the whole time. We were just perfect for each other and we were best friends. When we did bicker, we'd argue for five minutes and gush for ten minutes about how good we are at solving our problems. We lived together off and on, but never had an apartment together until last October.


Her backstory: she has one sister. Her father passed away when she was around 5 or 6, and was preparing her moms house/childhood home for sale. She had a lot on her plate this last year and I was there for her through everything.


So here's where it started. It was late March when she had started getting less sleep. I had finally pulled the trigger and ordered the engagement ring (that she picked... I'm unoriginal but she loved that ring) online


I didn't notice any weird behavior until mid-week, starting a cleaning product company, writing a book, etc.) which I attributed to just brainstorming (and she has come across some money recently). After we talked and I thought she was okay, she resumed writing her book. She casually mentioned her sister wanted to talk to me. I called her right away, and her sister pretty much told me exactly the way my girlfriend was acting the previous day. That's when I realized something was wrong. Bipolar disorder and mental illness runs strong in her family, so I knew it was a possible first manic attack right then.


We were up for 80 hours. She wouldn't sleep and slowly became delusional. I could type a book with the things that went on. The police were called three times and mental health experts were helpless until the final day when she popped out of bed saying the building was coming down. Until that point she didn't want to go to the hospital. That time she came with.


They discharged her after 2 days. She gets out


After she got out, agitated, and told me she's moving my things around and I can come get them whenever. Again, agitated but not mad or anything. Like she was frustrated with something else but handling our relationship problems fine. I complied, went and got my stuff (in fear that she might destroy something) and put it in storage. We stayed in touch but she grew more and more agitated with everything over the course of that week.


Finally, and that she was sad because she didn't know ""what was going on"". She asked me to come the next day at 4pm. The next day, an hour before I'm supposed to be there, she texts me, saying the people at the restaurant down the street stole her credit cards and she's going to leave without paying. Cops called, no charges but they took her back to the hospital a third time.


They said they would probably take it to a judge (?) on the third time to maybe get her long-term care


I went over there since I hadn't heard from her in a few days. I walked in and I see a guitar and a skateboard. I entered the bedroom, scrambles, and comes out IN A PAIR OF MY DIRTY BOXERS I LEFT BEHIND and starts yelling at me. We exchange words and he literally forces me out of my apartment. I just leave. The last time I saw her was when a police officer escorted me back over there to get my electronics. She was still manic and he was still there.


She then flew to New York with this guy (we live on the west coast) and spent around $20k. We tracked her as long as we could online but she started using cards her sister and I didn't have access to. The dude ended up god knows where (probably flew back) and my girlfriend ended up in North Dakota with a NEW guy. This guy is cool though and I got in touch with him via Facebook through her account.


She told him (and has been telling people) that I was physically and emotionally abusive to her. I'm not entirely sure how that manifested itself. I never raised my voice at her when she was manic and I always kept my cool. I guess I can attribute it to being a delusion but it still hurts really bad to have that accused. I can't even tell you. It took some convincing


That Tuesday


I've been staying away from home but I'm going back since it sounds like she won't be home for a bit. I gotta put that apartment back together and I simply can't stay away from home any longer. I don't know what to do because it has been so long and she's saying these terrible things about me that aren't true. I'm getting spotty updates about it via text from this new guy but I'll have the latest soon. It's been really really really hard.


I need some advice and maybe someone could tell me if this MIGHT be something more serious. I also would appreciate any advice as to how I should handle all of this. It has been the worst thing I've ever gone through. I feel so bad for her but I'm also not doing great myself

1365619339.0,1c2vse,Abusive therapist,sandy59,25,2,9,"I want to share my story

I was having a lot of problems dealing with my emotions from day to day. It was severely affecting my ability to work because I would get so scared or angry or sad about something that I would be so upset for 3 or 4 hours and unable to calm down and concentrate on anything. I could only put in my full concentration about half of the time (and even for part of that time I was only half focusing). I didn't have a lot of money but I figured this was something worth spending money on since it was so severely affecting my ability to work and because me being able to work more and work better/harder would be a huge benefit to me. So I decided to spend the money and see a counsellor who specialized in helping people deal with their emotions. 

Anyway the long and short of it was that he started flirting with me (the idea that a therapist would do this was just so far out of left field for me that I did not recognize it as flirting for a long time). And it calmed me down immensely emotionally of course so I thought that therapy was working! I thought that therapy was working because he was an expert (he was a prof at a local university and had worked with the leading person in the field) and was incredibly good! He wanted me to call him several times in the week and he would talk to me for fifteen or twenty minutes. He would also only be helpful to me if I was very flirtatious with him too (again it was so far out of left field to me that a therapist would do this that I did not realize he wanted me to flirt with him). 

The whole premise of the therapy got changed from helping me to deal with my emotions/concentrate to helping me work on relationships with people (he implied that this was the reason that I could not concentrate).

Something felt uncomfortable but when I mentioned this to a couple of friends of mine they encouraged me to stay and keeping talking to him. He was also a prof at a university near here and they were a bit overawed by that fact and him having a PhD too (rolls eyes). 

Because I had no idea that he was flirting with me and the only time he was being responsive to me was when I was flirting back with him and because I thought that we were working on relationships

The long and short of this is that I started being really inappropriate with a lot of people professionally. I wanted social support from them (sometimes people who were not meant to give me that) and I would flirt with them in order to get it. I did not realize I was flirting, obviously because there was a huge sexual element to the fit with him that made me feel very good and very ""understood"" and ""supported"". I just could not connect with any counsellor because the way they made me feel was so ""bad"" (in comparison to him) and now I was comparing all counsellors to him. They wanted me to calm down and not flirt and by then I thought that that was the way to be. 

I needed someone to take me aside and EXPLICITLY explain to me that what was going on with him was sexual in nature and of course it felt GREAT and would be the BEST THING EVER at helping me calm down because there was a sexual element to it and sex is a huge and powerful thing. I needed it pointed out that OF COURSE no other non-abusive relationship with a counsellor was ever going to measure up or make me feel quite as great and UNDERSTOOD and as CARED FOR as he had made me feel. 

Everyone who tried to disapprove of the way I was acting

At the moment everything is a huge mess, although I did NOT understand it as trying to get people to FLIRT with me :( I thought that I just wanted them to be super nice to me. I don't know how I could be so oblivious. I am almost wondering if I have a touch of Aspergers now that I did not recognize my behaviour as flirting, especially given people's responses. I am horrified that I was so inappropriate with people. I want to apologize to everyone that this happened with, but I feel like it would be embarrassing or make the situation worse to say, ""I was flirting with you and I'm so sorry, I didn't realize what I was doing.""

I have no idea why I didn't think of this when I originally saw this post. And because I'm afraid that commenting in the original post (b/c it's already old by reddit standards) will go unread when so many of you will probably find this information helpful to understanding yourselves

Anyway, what happens when you become manic). If anyone really wants to read it, reply here or PM me and I'll scan it for you. It'd be pretty bloody long to type it all out. Anyway, here's the gist of it: ""No matter what the individual may privilege in terms of introversion or extraversion, the mood swings characteristic of manic-depressive disorder have their own logic. I would reconstruct Jung's perspective in the following way: in manic-depressive disorder, mania must be extraverted, regardless of the individual's dominant or inferior attitude, regardless of the individual's dominant or inferior attitude. However, in this case, while an introvert will become an extravert. An intuiter will become a sensor

So, I am INFJ. When depressed, I will still be INFJ. As the last sentence notes, this is probably the case (with me it is definitely the case), but for some it may work differently. It's unclear. Anyway, when in mania, something pretty spectacular happens: I become ESTP. If you consider all the different types and the ways in which bipolars inhabit multiple types, say for example that I am ESTP while stable: I am ISTP (maybe

tl;dr The OP (kate_dane) is right. If you want to take the personality type test and are unsure

The unit I was sent to is 50 miles from where I lived

the psych they set me up with was the same one who I saw as a teen (she put me on Prozac originally which caused my first suicide attempt). She then drugged me to the point I couldn't get out of bed. I developed a fear of doctors at that point (I was on 15mg abilify, 90mg propranolol, and 600mg of seroquel. ) 

I eventually told her to go fuck herself and then went without meds for about 6 months when my roommate ( a doctor) had me committed on her orders. 

I was at a nice ward this time (UIC) and it was a totally different experience. I was placed in the female ward

The drs there listened to the rule that it had to be cheap and not totally zonk me out. I was placed on 150mg of Wellbutrin xr and 25mg of lamictial. 

I'm not a very social person in the best of times


I stayed med compliant until the combo I was put on was making me suicidal again (and I was developing a severe anger problem

I managed to avoid the hospital again until August 2012 where I checked myself in again and pleaded to go back to UIC. The head dr in the ER made up a phony letter saying the state one they were going to send me to refused to administer my hormones and that it was a no go and I was at UIC again. 


Now

Since I had been there before the nurses all remembered me

i was allowed to talk to the nurses as much as I'd like (they tried not to keep too long of conversations with the other patients. (some of them taught me some very valuable life skills

The one thing I learned from that trip is that Haldol is nasty and to never take it (apparently the resident I had got it backwards when she said the Ativan was for sleep (I got yelled at for requesting it.

I am friends on Facebook with the youngest girl I talked to on my last trip and still text with another every once in a while. 

The zyprexa worked for a few weeks but then I became depressed and I had managed to gain 20lb in two weeks so it was replaced with depakote. That did nothing except make me suicidal. 

I am now on Seroquel (100mg ir a day) and everything works great. The hospital set me up with a psych and therapist at the same clinic where I see my doctor. They are all very supportive and have renewed my faith in the mental health facility. Unfortunately my psych left the clinic this month  but as long as I remain stable I can just get refills from my doc (I have a year and a half with of refills though).

(Note: the first line is spoken by the doctor

""'What I'm trying to ask

Her gaze moved off. 'That's what you guys want to call it

The doctor clicked his pen slowly a few times and explained that he's more interested here in what *she* would choose to call the feeling

The resumed study of the movement of her feet. 'When people call it that I always get pissed off because I always think *depression* sounds like you just get really sad, and reminded himself to monitor the patient's hands and feet carefully during the interview for any signs of tetanic contraction, in which case the prescribed therapy would be I.V. calcium in a saline percentage he would need quickly to look up.

'Well *this*'--she gestured at herself--'isn't a state. This is a *feeling*. I feel it all over. In my arms and legs.'

'That would include your carp--your hands and feet?'

'All *over*. My head, the most horrible thing you can imagine--no, worse than you can imagine because there's the feeling that there's something you have to do right away to stop it but you don't know what it is you have to do, and then it's happening, too, the whole horrible time, it's about to happen and also it's happening

'So you'd say anxiety is a big part of your depressions.'

It was now not clear whether she was responding to the doctor or not. 'Everything gets horrible. Everything you see gets ugly. *Lurid* is the word. Doctor Garton said *lurid*, like every sound you hear all of a sudden has teeth. And smelling like I smell bad even after I just got out of the shower. It's like what's the point of washing if everything smells like I need another shower.'

The doctor looked intrigued rather than concerned for a moment as he wrote all this down. He preferred handwritten notes to a laptop because he felt that M.D.s who typed into their laps during clinical interviews gave a cold impression.

Kate Gompert's face writhed for a moment while the doctor was writing. 'I fear this feeling more than I fear anything, or environmental toxicity. Anything.'

'Fear is a major part of anxiety

[...]

'Listen

The doctor made a gesture like Well sure.

'But that's just in your stomach, but it couldn't, and you felt that way all the time, and you're sure, you're positive the feeling will never go away, you're going to spend the rest of your natural life feeling like this.'

The doctor wrote down something much too brief to correspond directly to what she'd said. He was nodding both while he wrote and when he looked up. 'And yet this nauseated feeling has come and gone for you in the past, has it not?'

'But when you're in the feeling you forget. The feeling feels like it's always been there and will always be there

I just wanted to give up. I managed to get my phone out and call the house. My four year old came out and asked why I was crying.

He went manic about two years ago for the first time. He'd never had any problems prior. He was 21 when it happened. Only the first time it was weeks of staying up late writing these crazy theories about the universe

My parents were in denial

Eventually one day he got aggressive and my youngest brother had to help me hold him down
My mum managed to get him on a train (he was too afraid to drive in cars because of the slim chance of having a crash). 

Anyway they diagnosed him and gave him meds. 

He was ok after a few weeks and came home

A month or so ago he decided he didn't want to take his pills because he didn't need them. We all tried to tell him it was a bad idea but you guys would know if you are manic you don't listen to logic and aren't rational. 

Anyway he was getting really obbsesed with writing a movie. Then a song. 

Anyway today I came home from work and all of his things from his room had been moved out

So that was weird. I asked him why he did it, I'm stupid"" and he seemed embarrassed, like a normal reaction. 

This was like 6pm? 

Anyway I made dinner and dad told him to take the dog for a walk (so dad could ring his friends and explain why he was calling them all crazy like, take a sedative, and then take him to see his psychiatrist tomorrow). 

He was gone for about 40 mins. When he came back I

But he said ""Nope no idea Lol"" but in a kind of aggressive voice. 

I didn't think much I knew he was getting kind of manic so I didn't want to pester him. 

So I went into my room and was writing a really great response to an AMA answer on that tom hanks kid AMA

I heard him yell ""STAY THE FUCK AWAY FROM (OUR DOGS NAME)!"". 

I was like wtf, then he walked right up to me , right in my face and was just trying to get me to fight him, he was calling me fat, and saying I never do anything (which is true, but at least I have a job), and said something like, I just tried to stay calm but honestly I was pretty scared. He started saying ""It's all obvious now

Dad walked behind him and mouthed ""I'm calling the cops""

He had totally snapped. Cracked. I've never seen it like this before
He said ""Do you know why I have to choke the dog?"" I ignored him and walked out the back to make sure the dog was ok. 

""because I'm the devil"". 

Now you should know he absolutely LOVES that dog. More than anyone in the family. And she loves him back too. 


So I just stood out the back with no weapon just thinking I'll have to take him down.. Mean while WHERE THE FUCK ARE THE POLICE! 

My dad had rang 000 emergency five minutes ago but no one was there. This is a small town

I ran 000 again and by this stage he had decided he was going to run away because his mum told him to stay put (dad had called mum who was at work ((nightshift)), he started yelling where is mine? I told him I don't know! (honestly I had no idea) he picked up my iphone and said ""is this it?"" I said NO that my phone, he shrugged and threw it on the tiles, it broke the screen and the back, but I didn't care I was more concerned about getting the cops there ASAP!

She said they were on their way (now ten minutes later). I went out the front to try to flag them down.


Just as I went out they were driving past. They missed our place. Fuck. I ran out to the road (i'm very unfit) and tried waving my iphone to flag them down. They didn't see me. They drive about 1km down the road in the totally wrong direction. What the fuck. Why don't police have fucking GPS????They're like a hundred bucks???


I ran out tot he road and they didn't see me flag them down ( i was waving my broken iphone but it was too dim they didn't see it). 

Then I heard him come out the front of our house and he was walking toward me, he's way fitter than me and totally fucking psychotic. 

He was saying ""Im coming for you"" ""should have hid better"" in a kind of sing song murderer  voice. 

I ran into the neighbours place calling triple 0 YELLING at them to get there. I know I wasn't being rational by then but it was so fucking simple

Mean while my brother starts smashing on the door. The neigbours are like WTF, brother smashed half the door in while I was trying to hold it, while trying to call 000 to get there! 

Then he started singing 'tip toe, I said THE COPS ARE OUT SIDE NOW! even though I knew they weren't. 

But it kind of worked because he started talking to the guys inside, I was like FUCK he's going to break the TV and the pisssed off guy is going to bash him! I said look don't hurt him he's crazy!

I ran off home and go my keys and BELTED it to the road in my avalon, I said ""Did you see cops go past here?""!!! He said yeah but was vague, he was suspicious of me or something. 

I floored it again and then saw the cops, FOLLOW ME! 

I floored it back down the road, and they did too. I told him he was inside but HE WAS NOT ARMED, they kept asking that (fair enough) but I didn't want them to hurt him. 

They went in side and luckily he didn't put up a fight, no one, would obviously ever say. 

He was feining possession like a devil as they walked him away

He started singing the tulips song again. 

I was really worked up

I said this to the cop and he took it personally

The young cop walked with me and dad back to our house

We gave the cop statements. 

Anyway they took him to the local hospital. They aren't equipped to deal with him. We want to get him back to the melbourne clinic. We have private health insurance so it should be ok. 

My mum and dad are at the hospital with him. The police are still there. 

He is refusing to take any drugs. 

So now what? He is trained as a nurse, I guess. He is 23, is so smart, has his whole life, and he's fucked it, because he stopped taking his medication. 

I recorded some of the conversations with the cops with my iphone. I want to play them back one day, in the hope he will never consider going off them again. Because by the time he decides he is going off them, it's too late, he is manic and then this will happen again.


Sorry about the bad writing I'm normally pretty good but I'm so worked up and tired and don't have anyone to talk to

I think stopping on his own was possibly the cause for this sudden onset. 

I feel the worst for my mum. She's pretty old and finally got a good job even though it's night shift, she is heartbroken as you can imagine, I feel so bad for my parents, and my brother. Right now I can't see a time when he will ever be able to live a normal life. Unless he stays on his meds for good. But who knows?


Anyway thats all I have to say about that.

We were sharing stories of our struggles and she shared a story of what she did to a neighbor she was feuding with. Apparently my mom went to the neighbors door and threw carrots and a note at her when she opened the door and said 'here

She stomped off back home. I later found out the note said 'tricks are for kids' along with half a dozen mini carrots.

1342368029.0,wlhag,Disposing of the Mentally Ill,lael8,23,1,15,"I had a recent conversation that I feel is worthy of observation.  I was talking with a parent of an individual with mental illness and the parent expressed to me that stigma would be decreased in this country if families and I’m imaging parents specifically

 I can appreciate the intense need to protect one’s child, the label also offered family the right to interfere on behalf of the individual and seek treatment for that individual?

So would this eliminate stigma?  Would allowing families the right to make decisions and access medical records of individuals with mental illness help to eliminate stigma?  How so?  Or would being able to institutionalize another person against his or her will just eliminate society from seeing them and what they have?  And is that a reducer of stigma?  

In the 1500’s in Europe the “mad” were taken out of society and placed on ships to wander the sea.  Later madhouses replaced ships and the unemployed and poor were added to the insane as a means of reformation and for keeping the above mentioned groups from undermining the norms of society.  Eventually, which is not working all the effectively either because society is not equipped to accommodate the needs of the mentally ill population. So in the midst of the little jag of history, where does giving the family the right to make decisions for individuals factor in?  Think about it.  
Here is my view.  As a person who has a mental illness, but passing laws that allow the family to make life decisions against those of the individual, not to mention have access to medical records, would affect me as well because I am mentally ill.  And I am not at all okay with my family taking over my personal freedoms and seeing records that are mine.  I have to ask individuals who are not mentally ill, “How would you like to have someone in your family decide you are going to be put away in and institution?”  How would it feel to know your family can have access to your medical records any time they would like?  See, once we step over that line that protects personal freedoms, we have entered a very dangerous place that is only a step away from ships wandering around, on the ocean.  I, that is my one basic freedom

I also believe that embracing such an ideology enforces stigma rather than eliminates it.  But again, and I found that reassuring because she has experienced me suicidal many times over the past 20 years. 

So here is what I propose to help your family if you have a mental illness.  If you are no longer in denial about having a mental illness, my husband has those powers with consultation from my mom and sister.  It’s not difficult to set such a thing up, and I still have control over how it would be managed.  The best policy is to plan ahead if you can at all.  If you are person who moves in and out of sanity, when you have a sane moment, get it done so that your family does not have to fight the system to take care of you.  It is valuable to remember that while many families love and want to take care of family members with mental illness, there are just as many who do not and who would take advantage of the option to just dispose of a life that struggles with mental illness by having the person locked up in and institution.

i worked an extra 17 hours this weekend. i even stayed up a full night trying to fix something. i got it working and everything went smooth for the rest of the events. 

... why do i care? my life is a total wreck. yet i would bend over backwards to make sure things go well for work. because i know that if i mess up

so that means i can take care of thousands of people

do i present myself as this butterfly as people tell me? or is it just encouragement because i have low self esteem and they just need me at work because no one else will do what i do. mainly because they have families and can't drop what they are doing because a broadcast is having an issue. but they get paid the same as me. they get the same benefits. why am i doing all this work

1363027574.0,1a3hou,"This started as a reply, but after two hours, a pack of smokes and a big cup of juice, it became something more.",Namrorrim,1, as long as I can remember. However

I always considered my ups and downs as normal, dropping out of school half way through the year, the hours and hours I spent in bed. 

When I was 18 I was drafted into the army, feeling like I was making a difference, my physical health went from fat with a screen tan to solid muscle mass, with a dark tan from hours in the sun. 

Then I fell. Something happened to my knee. I got kicked off of my base, I had no base, I had no one to answer to, and no one I could ask for help. Only a slip of paper with an address, that I would hobble on my crutches to, every day, sit outside an unmarked building waiting for someone to tell me what to do, until 6 pm. Then I would hobble back to my parents house, I feel like I'm floating in an endless ocean

One day, I would exercise for hours. It wasn't easy, but when I got a position, I could just limp, in my own, and that was a big deal. 

I was moved to a base, making sure they had food, water, beds, clothing, gear, ammo

That's when I started having nightmares. I would wake up, for days, trying to escape the hellish nightmares I knew we're waiting for me, when I let my guard down. I threw myself into my work, tirelessly cleaning my storerooms, reorganizing everything I had, I would work out, trying not to fall asleep while lifting weights. 

Everything came crashing down around me, and open wounds. He got up and left without a word, and the next day I was transferred to another unit. I sank down into depression, the likes of which I have not experienced since then. 

I was moved from unit to unit, sitting in my room, cutting, and listening to music. I tried to escape by reading books, I read everything I could get, but nothing helped. 

I would take walks in the dead of night, I would stand looking down, for hours, until the sun came up. Then I would slink through the base, back to my room, my private place of torment, and pain. 

I think I was sent to the emergency room once or twice during that time, with a bloodstained uniform glued to my body. They'd take the initiative to get me sent to the emergency room, but I always ended up back on base with some bullshit diagnosis like OCD, or none at all. 

One day, alive. My whole body seared with... This pleasant tingling. Every time I moved, my scabs would crack, and pull. It felt amazing, really. I hadn't felt as alive as that in a long time. I put on a clean uniform, I ventured out, I went to do whatever my job was at the time, I just joined in on the manual labor

I noticed something was wrong, I heard whispers following me everywhere I went.  Then it hit me, I was covered in a bloody uniform, probably pale as a ghost. No one had seen me in months. So I went to the doctor. 

I got into her office, I told her about the depression, I told her how I'd felt alive that morning. 

She told me she would get me help

Next thing I know, telling me I'd be doing guard duty for the next two weeks. 

I'm in my room, everyone seems upset, I don't even remember coming up here. Suddenly someone is pulling something away from me. I hold onto it for dear life. It slips out of my fingers. ""Are you crazy?!"" ""What the fuck are you thinking?!?"" ""Why didn't you talk to us?!"" 

That's how I was let out of the army. I saw two people the same day. Then I was discharged. 

I think my parents noticed something wasn't right. I insisted on moving out of their house as soon as I was discharged. I found a job in the city

I was cooking in a bar, or cubalibre. I would finish my shifts with a few beers, and a couple of shots. I would go home and drink, I would wake up in the middle of the night thirsty, and I would drink. It was a dark time. 

I tried to kill myself, sometimes I would puke it all up. 

Then I discovered pot. It was a godsend. My leg stopped hurting, laughing, I made friends, I was going out, I started bringing girls home every night. I thought ""wow, I feel good, I'm making money, this is what life should be like.""

But then I started getting less shifts. Money was tight, to my dealers, to my friends. So I have my two weeks notice. Set up an interview with a bigger more high end restaurant, I thought I had everything under control. 

I woke up the next morning in my shower, my two front teeth were cracked in half, my lip was dripping blood. I pulled out the rest of my teeth from the nasty gash in my lip, washed up, and called a cab to the E.R. 

After a few weeks, moving up faster than they could believe. Prep to cold line in two weeks, cold line to hot line in a month and a half, hot line to night manager in a month. I was cooking up a storm, feeling great. I was hardly sleeping, hardly eating, putting so much Ritalin up my nose, I was god. I was unstoppable. 

So I decided to see how far I could go. Acid, pot, booze, nicotine, morphine, shrooms. I did every drug I could get my hands on, and I was still able to out-cook, and do my bidding. My food was godly

But being god got boring. I didn't want to be better, 20mg morphine, 20mg Xanax, 50mg oxy, bottles of booze to wash it down. But without fail, I would wake up a few hours later, hungover

Then my favorite co-worker quit. He was happy, or stoned, so detached in my own little benzo's world. 

Money runs out, and I would have. My friend wants to move in with me, he has a friend who wants a room too, he tells me she's cool. So we get an apartment.  I work in the bar, then I work at home, painting, cleaning, putting up shelves

The friend is cool, so why not? I can tell she doesn't like the drugs, she drinks, and smokes my pot, but she steers clear of me when I'm in my own little world. I start thinking, I may have a problem, doing lots of drugs. I'm miserable, I'm out of money

I'm drunk, I dig in, they're gone, so is the beer, I run home, bring a bag. Rum, vodka, pot, and tell him to grab a controller, I'm feeling alive

I wake up on the couch, he's looking at me. I ask what's wrong. He slaps me across the face, tells me I can talk to him, goes to bed. 

I walk home. My body hurts. I'm crying. I know I'm not right. My life has been hellish at least since before the army. I call my parents

I lock myself in their basement, down, up, down. Every minute brings a new mood. I'm sick, it hurts, I'm sweating. I wake up a weeks later, sober

I started taking long walks, sobriety. I actually have to face myself. I feel like I'm recovering from an illness. Philosophy, questions. I run them through my head, all the time. it doesn't stop. I just can't figure out why I'm here.

I go back to the city. I keep myself stoned. It's the easiest way to cope. I get a job, and don't go back.

I see a few doctors, sinking, sinking. 

4 am. I call my parents. ""Can you come take me to the E.R.?"" ""What's up

They sent me to an inpatient clinic. 

They told me I'd do better as an outpatient.

It's been a month. I still feel pointless. Everyday, brush my teeth, wash down my handful of pills. Vitamin D, Vitamin B, Mood stabilizer, antidepressant. I shower, get dressed. I smoke a fag. Coffee, homework, fag, Video games and fag.

My life has become going through the motions, pointless, and only existing as some childs science fair project, thrown in a box of memories, forgotten until the day the family moves, and leaves me behind to rust.

I'm not depressed, not there. I'm not anywhere. I float, in this endless void called life. Pointless, worthless, wondering what I've done wrong.

I don't know.

Fast forward a few years, and LSD (which I've probably done far too much of.) So I ignored all my emotional issues as even with them, I always had a stable job and could deal with them as I've always dealt with them. I will say that in no way am I saying people should take these drugs, but the introspection of LSD saved my life, as I'm also morbidly obese which I've been able to manage after a very emotional trip of LSD.

So I moved to Seattle, and the only way to get out of my incredibly moody and depressed state was to numb myself with pot. I had a better life though, I have a really good job, really great friends, and I've lost about 80 pounds, but I was still incredibly unhappy in all the in-betweens. So I got a psychiatrist because my GP said he wasn't going to prescribe anything for me when it comes to mental health. He ended up giving me Lamotrigine which I fought constantly. I had it in my mind that it was going to numb me, ruin me, that my psychiatrist was wrong, I would guess I was smoking around 500-700$ a month. 

So one of my newer groups of friends had a very unstable friend who claimed that depression, I didn't get angry because I felt bad for her. Me not getting angry was weird. I ended up reflecting on why I wasn't getting angry. After a while I realized it was because I was doing the same thing. My compulsive pot smoking was right down that alley of ignoring what was real, that it was more than likely what was exacerbating my mental health issues. So I quit smoking, and I kept on the meds, and I've never been clearer in my life. 

I can lay in my bed at night in silence and sleep, or anxiety. I still have stuff to work on like debt, my life, getting things like clothes and a new bed, because I'm not constantly worrying about whatever it was I was always worrying about and trying to fill it with something that I thought was helping.

I was born with a mood disorder, I needed to be there with him.) When I was nine, I started anger management per my parents who found my fits of rage and lashing out in anger totally abnormal, which I agree. At this point, I was an out-of-control nine year old with an acute awareness of the fact that her brain didn't work the same way everyone else's did. It didn't work or process emotions and information like the rest of the world. In my eyes, I was 'defective'.

I was hospitalized for the first time at 15 after telling a school counselor I could not vouch for my safety and had no drive to live anymore. I couldn't tell my parents this; when the school counselor first called to tell them he thought I was suffering from depression

That diagnosis was changed within 12 days of my discharge after Prozac shot me through the mania roof. I was diagnosed with Bipolar. The following year, I would not be here today. This called for another week-long stay in the hospital. After describing to my intake doctor my entire out-of-body experience during the whole ideal, and his follow-up interview with my parents, my diagnosis was change to Type II Bipolar Cyclothymia. This was by far the most accurate diagnosis to date. I was released in time to hand out candy to Halloween trick-o-treaters. 

That spring, uncontrollable cyclothymic episode. That was four years ago. The year following my last stay was the last time I was on any sort of medication: 1800mg of Lithium and 10mg of Zyprexa. This would have made my total number of different prescriptions I have ever taken to a round 17. Seroquel has by far, with Lithium a close second, the most effective medication I have ever taken. With the support of my medication doctor, therapist and parents, I ended therapy and eased myself off medication. While the transition off was rough, the last three years have been bliss. 

I have recently started my first serious relationship, but I'm down to play ball. I will always try my best to understand, but please forgive me if I can't. I just want you to be happy, and whatever I can do to help I will."" We had our first fight two months after we started dating, and the last month has been plagued with fighting.

I will find myself suddenly overcome with this blinding rage in reaction to something that is said to me or something that happens. I find myself angry before I can even decide if it is worth being angry about. I suddenly lose control and find myself *watching* instead of in control. I can feel my self control slipping to the point where I become verbally abusive. After another fight over the weekend, as best he can. He can see when I lose myself; he can see how empty my eyes are and hear how illogical I become in my snide remarks. This is something I have struggled with my whole life; probably one of the most obvious early symptoms of my disease. 

Let's backtrack a couple months for the full story. Shortly before Halloween, when I was out costume shopping with my boyfriend, I momentarily lost track of him in the warehouse and the anxiety attack I thought I had managed to avoid came crashing in to me. I barely made it outside before I broke down sobbing. By the time we made it back to my apartment, I was a mess and my boyfriend was panicked; he had never seen this before and didn't know how to react. I managed to get 'call my dad' out between sobs and he immediately called him. My father talked me down as he always did and while the residual mood took a couple hours to totally wear off, I felt sane again, albeit sad. My boyfriend and I talked for a long time that night; I explained what happened and how I feel. Tried to explain no one thing sets it off. He wanted to be the person I called next time and asked what it is my father said to me on the phone. For the first time in my entire 23 year existence, someone loved me for my crazy and wanted to not only understand but stand by me and help. I am sure every one of you can relate to that feeling of having someone.

But the anger has only continued to linger, where I can count all the past anxiety attacks I've ever had on two hands. He says he can handle the sad me, but not the angry me. I can't handle either of me. I just want it to stop. I want to be 'normal' and stable. I want my life back. I want me back. At this point, I don't even know who I am anymore. I am just this bundle of bipolar scar tissue that is angry and sad about being angry and sad.

I don't have health insurance due to a recent job change. I thought a healthier work and sleep routine would help bring balance back (in the past it normally has), another integral part of coping and managing bipolar, or at least mine. Today, after nearly losing my boyfriend this weekend due to another anxiety attack that flared and became a rage phase, I called my mother and confessed my mental shortcomings recently. She saw one first hand at the Oregon Civil War game two weeks ago, when I randomly started crying because I felt so uncomfortable being so exposed to so many people in such a large, open, combined with medication for the first time in three years

So today, I can have an even longer symptom-free streak than before. I hope to finally start and finish school on medication, a feet I have attempted too many times for my own good that ended in a fiery failure of dropping out. I hope to bring my boyfriend with me to a therapy session or two so he can truly take part in helping me manage my illness. But for today, for the first time ever, I am accepting this much needed change. I wish to have a family with children one day. I hope to be happy and successful my whole life. While I've said it before and it was true, I say it again to you right now: **Today is the day I take control of my life and happiness. And I shall WIN.**",,self,yellowgreen,

So it is finals week at UNC-A now, and so I got at most four hours of sleep. I was at someone else's house, and in the early hours of the morning, I started feeling that rise...the manic/hypomanic rise. I kept someone awake talking about how I wanted to go outside and run five miles...At four o' clock in the morning. He finally got me to shut up and went to sleep.

Soon after, and the sky looked like a rich purple and blue, pulsating. It was like a dream...I did not know it wasn't real until I woke up from it (when I took my medication). Sometimes mania can feel incredibly wonderful.

I did not see things this morning. I heard voices. There was this one low voice that kept repeating over and over, and then I mentally told it to shut the fuck up. That made the voice mad, and it said that every time I refused to kill myself, it would show me what would happen to my family. A vivid image of my sister getting ripped apart emerged in my mind.

It got better once I interacted with people

To top this off, ""I wish I could stop feeling so manic-depressive..."" in a really dramatic tone. I glared at him. He seems to think bipolar is just feeling stressed one minute and chilling out the next, or something like that.

Have you ever flown too close to the sun?

Have you ever been so close to perfection you can taste it?

Have you ever felt invincible

Unbeatable

Incomparable

Every action you made a construct of the god's

No one can tell you you're wrong

No matter how little backing you had

No matter how little rationale was present

You were invincible

You were untouchable

Although the feelings that follow

Will make you feel like porcelain

Every action made that night will eat at you

Like rats eating at a rotting corpse

Only the stench is worse

When you return to some semblance of reality

You will wish you were dead

Because although you shined brighter then the sun that night

The light you shined revealed your darkest secrets

The kind of secrets no man reveals

The kind of secrets that drive men to church

The kind of secrets that define the devil

And everyone you love has seen them


Shining so bright

They will never see you the same again

The sun has melted your wings 

And you begin your descent to the ocean floor

To be crushed under the weight of a mountain

This is the penance you pay

For playing as a god for a night.

Now that that's out of the road

It was another boring day in the psych ward, and watched the Star Wars Trilogy at least ten times. I'd made brownies, and rocky road cookies, and had grudgingly participated in the group exercise of the day, which was stretch-band yoga. 

I began to think. And think. I was a little drunk on a cocktail of what may have been a far larger dose of Zyprexa and Clonazepam than I ought to have been taking due to my low drug tolerance; we did not know this was a thing with me at the time. I'll never be sure if it was the medication or the bipolar that led to.. The incident. (One of them

I was busy mulling over my past relationships, and no men were truly interested in me for my intelligence. Naturally, I felt persecuted, why ought a goddess like myself be doomed to lead a life as nothing more than a trophy wife, a veritable waste of my numerous talents and charms? 

I thought about this for a time, oh yes. 

And it did. My toga was glorious. An incredible marvel of engineering

But a toga

No, luckily, hoarded some blank paper and tape, gained from the nurse's station whilst they were otherwise occupied by my fellow prisoners. I even had a crayola marker. It was brown. I wrote ""TROPHY WIFE"" in large letters across my ill-gotten loose-leaf, and pasted it to my back. 

What follows is possibly not ONLY a glorious rendition of my first foray into performance art

I snuck out of my room. It was an open floor plan. But by some mercy, my suffering. And then, I saw it. It would be the crucial instrument to my latest coup d'etat. 

I swiped the reception bell... And I dinged it loud and proud

This finally garnered some attention. They took away my bell and sent me to my room. I was devastated, came to my senses, and thought, ""Damn, but that was nuts. Epic, but nuts. Tomorrow I'm going to be a pirate. This makes *perfect sense!* ... Togas are stupid anyways.""

They all insist that I am causing problems for myself and that once I get busy and active and start doing things I will feel much more in control of my life and of my emotions; I agree that activity will make me feel better.


But I fucking hate everyone. I am an empty shell. I am full of bitterness and hate. I hate myself: everyone becomes brighter. I hate everyone else: I become brighter. I am always wearing a mask; I am always transparent. 


There is never a balance of yin and yang. I have tried meditation; I am trying to learn yoga but I get extremely frustrated because I have always been  terrible at learning new information and reciting it; I am trying to learn more about the world around me.


I CANNOT AFFORD MEDICATION OR PSYCHIATRIC VISITS!~~ :(
I don't trust doctors. I just want the medication. I just want the fucking medication but I can't afford the visits to their fucking terrible ""services."" I have never met a doctor who has helped me. They all give me SSRIs which have fucked me. I took Lithium once and should have stayed on it; after I stopped taking it I experienced a ""MANIC STATE"" for three weeks.


TL;DR: How are your meds? How's your life? Do you feel like this? Do I sound insane? Do you care? Has anything improved for you since you began treatment? I can't hold a fucking job or stay in school. Have your meds helped you with this? Are there any programs you could refer me to in order to help with my inability to pay for treatment? I want to get ""stable"" so I can feel comfortable enough to make something of myself. I want to feel comfortable in my skin and in my brain. That is all.

I am hyper-sensitive to all medications and substances (trust me, even on the lowest dose possible. I'm bipolar 2, technically; I've never had a mania episode bad enough to totally throw me off the chains, but the episodes I do get are enough to make life hell for a while. My biggest thing is the major, chronic depression I get interspersed with random high excitability, irritability, inability to sleep

Right now my doctor is trying to manage my depression and bad anxiety. I started Effexor a little over a month ago and it finally quieted enough of the stuff in my head to make me feel stable for a bit, in high school when I was going to a psychiatrist my mother appointed and didn't really have the agency I have today, I gained nearly 100 pounds on a combination of Risperdal and Lexapro over the course of about a year. It was a nightmare and I still haven't lost all that I gained. So, me being stubborn me, I stopped the Effexor cold turkey..couldn't break the pills in half, couldn't get in to see my doctor, and I was already on the lowest dose possible. 

Last night my irritability and frustration got so bad that I was having a hard time dealing with situations that probably don't make most people crazy, actually, which I am not saying to be rude or insensitive...I have worked with special needs kids most of my adult life and cherish them immensely) So, I took the Effexor after nearly a week off of it and I'm fighting to get in to see my doctor. It's hard to find specialists or get into see them where I live, even though it's a major city, but I feel like I should trust this guy as an internal medicine doc because he is very willing to listen to me and tweak medications, plus he's been doing research on medications to help figure things out for me. I get frustrated, because nothing ever seems to work. Thus far

After that it just gets worse, so you develop a really awful taste and bad breath. Second tip is that the rash HURTS. I'm not just talking painful itching rash, but like 3rd degree burns. By the end of the first few days of the rash, it will become very clear that you're not just fighting a rash, but something more. It's VERY IMPORTANT (I can not stress this enough) that at the first signs of a rash, you call your doctor ASAP, and if you start showing signs of it progressing that you get yourself to a hospital immediately.

The only other medication that has a higher rate is sulfa based antibiotics like bactrim. Not everyone who has a rash from medication like Lamictal will go on to getting SJS, but there are signs to look for so you can get treatment right away. I just wanted to let everyone here know, because no one warned me. I was told to watch for a rash, everyone mentions a rash, but no one talks about the fact that it's not JUST a rash.

I know most of this is my fault but I also wish he'd try harder to understand my illness and help me through it.

You couldn’t be here if stars hadn’t exploded, oxygen, iron, all the things that matter for evolution - weren’t created at the beginning of time.

One of my parents is also bipolar. As far as I know, and has been clear, through the years that they are suffering with bipolar disorder. It made my upbringing very difficult and our relationship was very much strained for many years. Knowing this, I did my best to bite my tongue and keep to myself when I moved back home. 

Sometimes I just. can't. take. it! 

When I make a snappy remark in return to something nasty being said to me, my behavior (even if I'm sitting in my room alone), etc. just for laughs. I can tell that these are the manic episodes. Defending myself becomes out of the question. I'm yelled at for not humoring this behavior followed by the bedroom door slamming. Constantly. I don't know what's worse though... the manic phase where I'm being picked on, or being around someone who refuses to get out of bed or come out of their room. 

It becomes so intolerable because I'm fighting so hard to keep my emotions to myself through this. I don't yell. I don't slam doors. I don't make nasty comments. And I pull myself out of bed on the days that I would rather sink into the comfort of my blankets and pillows and never get up again. This tortures me more than dealing with being bipolar on my own.

Everyone is worried I will try to kill myself and down more Ativan than I did the last time. Honestly the thought has crossed my mind but I won't do it. My parents text me all day as it is to check on me....

Now sure about the point of this post. I guess just giving an update as to what actually happened. I will be applying for medicaid and disability at the urging of my social worker.

I have been taking lamitcal for 2 months now and I feel great.  For the first 3 weeks or so I was pretty low.  At first I thought it wasnt working and making things worse but my psychiatrist said that that is normal.  So if you feel low for longer than normal at first know that it is normal and you will feel more stable as time goes on.   Yes I still have ups and downs but they are nowhere near as deep or high as they used to be and to tell you the truth I am up more than I am down. This is contrary to what I used to be.  I used to go about a week being down and like 2 days being up so I couldnt keep things constant such as jobs or relationships.  I am feeling a lot more stable and it is great.  I have been up for a week and a half now and its incredible and only down for a week.  This is an improvement because the amount of up time has increased.  I am finally able to lift consistently and work my schedule for work.  I have missed maybe two days out of 2 months because I ran out.  This is the #1 thing you can do.  The person who is prescribing you is a professional (hopefully) and has a job for a reason.  They know what they are doing and it will get better as time goes on.  It has taken a couple months for me but damn was it worth it.

During the relationship they seem too ecstatic for words and invest everything they have in that person

I've read quite a lot of literature on manic depression (so as to be better informed about my friend's condition)

My theory is some bipolar suffers (like my friend) self medicate their condition using love.  I think they try to achieve hyperthymic or hypomanic phases, energetic, alive, and respite from horrible depressions.  I believe those phases can be triggered using the lovely neurochemicals associated with new relationship energy (NRE) and love : oxytocin, seratonin, dopamine, norepinephrine etc.  So they meet a person who ticks some boxes, invest almost everything you have in that person (in my friend's case about 99.99% of their focus, happy and hypomanic for a while.  They're so happy and they project that glorious energy and intensity that they've gained back onto the source of their happiness (the significant other)

What I mean is that you don’t have the option to determine what it affects and what it does not.  Wouldn’t that be nice though?  I sign a contract with my brain and the mental illness agrees to only rear its ugly head in this

It is so difficult to have to view every moment of one’s life through the lens of mental illness.  There was once a time when I could remember what it was like to not have that lens, it’s cyclical.  And what really stinks about bipolar disorder is that we live a life of extremes so long before we find stability, by the time we get to a place where we can poke our heads out at the world and consider joining it, we no long know what is acceptable and what is not. 

 For example
Often I have done something that I perceived to be very rational and middle of the road only to find that my loved ones are shaking their heads, and for this reason I do not trust others.
  
I do not have answers for this.  I am struggling to accept that what I see in the world is hell and gone from what most people see who do not deal with mental illness.  This is where God intervenes…well he intervenes on several levels when I let him.  But this is where I believe he intervenes and helps me learn, may we all be able to take our little bipolar lenses and move on.

**Something to listen to.** I bought a hypnosis down load and put it on my iPod. I used the hypnosis recording two or three times before I fly, cheaply all over the web.

**Something to smell.** I find smells can calm me down and/or set up to  panic. If  someone close-by smells sweaty or unclean that could set me off. Now I have a tool to combat it. I purchased a roll on oil which has lavender and bergamot in it. It’s my fresh air when I feel stifled.

**Something to taste.** I choose fruit flavoured boiled sweets. Might sound weird, you have to suck the sweet, which give you something to focus on – like its taste, how small it is getting, and the texture of it on your tongue.

**Something to drink.** Water – Everyone should travel with a bottle of water anyway. Plane travel especially is very dehydrating, I once treated myself to a shot of Jack Daniels, before landing, but it wouldn’t have had time to reach my system till after I’d left the plane.  

**Something to cool me down.** I choose a hand held fan – mine is very loud though. Try to get one less annoying than mine! I only use it if a feel especially breathless or stifling hot. It helps! Wet wipes which smell of lemons are also a less annoyingly noisy option. 

**Something to warm me up.** However much I loathe being too hot

**Something to calm me down.** Although my hypnotherapy down load helps

**Something to read/do.** First and foremost, because then I can usually get right back into it on the plane. It really helps me get through that awful stage where everyone around me fusses and fights over luggage locker space, getting to their seats and whatever else people do (why do they have to take so long to sit down – aarrgh?).

This is pretty difficult for me because I am relatively unfamiliar with how to deal with issues like this (which is why I am asking for help).

I suppose the real problems started coming to us when we would drink together (we are both in college

A couple weeks ago, but I can't tell if this time it's because I hurt his feelings or he's really angry at me.

I know we both like spending time with each other

I guess my question is: Should I keep trying to talk to him or would it be best to leave him alone? I'm really trying to understand how he thinks better so that I know the best way to deal with these situations.

My wife of 13 years was diagnosed a few months ago with Bi-Polar Disorder. The diagnosis explained much about the problems we’ve been having the last 3-4 years as a result of recession imposed paycuts and job changes which ultimately ended up with me re-enlisting in the military after a long break in service. It also explained much about the crazy, apparently bipolar woman can be insanely exciting and satisfying…)  Of course

To be clear, lashing out, hypochondria, slight financial irresponsibility (slight because we have very little money or credit these days), and narcissism. She’s not self-destructive (though she did a lot of drugs in her 20s before I met her) or any danger to our kids. 

Since her diagnosis I’ve moved back in.  I’ve started my own therapy and she’s asked me for at least six months to get her medications dialed in and her own therapy a chance to work….but I don’t know if I’m already too far gone. We have two kids (5 and 8) and frankly they’re the only reason I even want to try…I’m a very involved dad and I can’t imagine being away from them. But it doesn’t change the fact that I have a LOT of resentment built up from the years where I didn’t speak up or was more adamant about her behavior. I have what my therapist calls ‘escape fantasies’ more often than I think I should. I’ve developed feelings for other women…nothing I’ve acted on but I feel like I’m missing out… After two months I don’t see a huge change except that she doesn’t have as many mood swings as she used to. We haven’t had sex in months and I don’t feel a desire to be intimate with her at all right now.

Each drop whispers of my internal rage.

The black keys ring in the velvet night.

Together they make a little tune

Hope falls with the raindrops down from the sky

And when I wake up from this rose-colored dream

The fairies will be gone

After walking about halfway down the little sidewalk to the front door, I raised an orphan squirrel when I was in college, after all!

I said something silly like ""Oh
And he started. scampering. towards. me. *quickly*

Immediately my brain yells ""RABID SQUIRREL! GOING FOR YOUR BARE FEET! RUUUUN!"" So I made a little pathetic squeaky fear noise and hightailed it back inside

My youngest son was standing behind me

""Um, um...running towards me.""

I look out the window again just in time to see this poor little guy obviously freaked out and racing up a tree to safety with what I swear was a ""wtf just happened there?"" look in his little face.

My son's reaction: ಠ_ಠ   ""A squirrel? You ran inside...because of a...squirrel?""

I can't seem to be happy. I can't seem to stop myself from taking out my hate for myself on others, especially the ones I love. I excel at pushing people away.

I hate the fact that I can't seem to stand up for myself or be assertive. I hate the fact that when I do, it ends up hurting people and pushing them away.

I hate the fact that if I do have change, it's almost immediately taken away from me by my own hand or by circumstance.

Years ago when my anorexia really *took over*, I was depressed, and all sorts of other negative side effects presented themselves. I don't know exactly when it ""changed"" but I now have issues with a binge/starve cycle. I will starve myself for days before going on a couple of days long binge. My doctor questioned what a ""binge"" is to me, and apparently I don't fit that ""criteria"" but a binge to me is eating much more than I usually do in a short amount of time to make myself feel full. Only then comes the starvation period again. On and on and on. 

When I really analyze the pattern it seems to be in line with my manic/depressive phases. Sometimes I have mixed moods and feel two ways about binging or starving. Currently, I stop binging and start starving. 

Part of me (disgustingly) wishes that I could just starve to that low weight again, plus he told me it wouldn't make me gain weight. I'm not sure if it is working on its own because I still feel these dips of depression and highs of mania through the leveled out feeling.

I received it this afternoon through text.  I haven't even talked to my supervisor yet.  I know what some of you are thinking.  Is this legal in the U.S?  The answer is yes.  I was working as an independent contractor

I had taken a break from this job to focus on something else that actually brought in a lot of money.  When I tried to go back, showered, got dressed, put my tie on and then the anxiety swept over me like a tidal wave.  I couldn't move forward.  I was pinned by heavy debris created by my own mind.

What happens now?  My first thought is suicide.  I can't imagine living my life this way forever.  I graduated in 2011 hoping to finally find a good job with health insurance.  Since then

My meds that had been working on me for 10 years suddenly stopped doing their magic.  I couldn't function.  I couldn't properly search for a job.  When I would get interviews

I had to move back into my parents home because of this.  It was the only place I could go.  It made me much worse.   The environment here is toxic.  There are 3 bedrooms here

My father is an alcoholic.  He doesn't work.  He doesn't talk to me nor anyone in the house.  He drinks beer all day and stays in his room. Its so bad he even got refrigerator for himself so he could avoid having to pass through anybody on his way to the kitchen.  He's got a serious problem and won't admit to it.  Every once in a while he tries to start a fight with me.  He'll call me lazy and stupid.  He'll try to run me out

My sister lives here with her 2 kids.  She doesn't talk to me nor the family either.  She's been convicted of marijuana possession. This was not some dumb mistake she made while she was young, even when they are sick.  Sometimes, she doesn't feed them and they end up eating cereal or potato chips for lunch.  Her son wets his bed.  Many times, she's put him to bed without changing the sheets.  The boy sleeps in his own urine.

There's my brother.  He's cool I guess.  Nice guy

Finally my mother.  She's the only one in this family who works besides me. And she works hard.  I don't know how she does it because I would have liked to inherit those genes.  She leaves the house around 6 in the morning and comes back at 8, she still picks up and cleans after him, does his laundry and serve him food.  She doesn't talk to him, she doesn't pressure him to get a job, she doesn't say anything when he abuses the rest of the family.  She allows him to live his life in his happy little bubble at the expense of the rest of us.  

She does the same with my sister and my brother.  She allows my sister to neglect her kids and go out and party every night.  Recently, ""Because the kids won't be able to go to school.""  I told her there was something called a bus.  She said, ""Well, they would have to wake up early.""  She allows my sister to neglect her children so that the kids wouldn't have to wake up early.  What kind of logic is that?  

She allows them to destroy themselves, I do my best to help my mother out anyway I can when I am healthy.  I've worked hard to actually get a job so she doesn't have to support me too much.  But being in this chaotic environment is slowly killing me.  I have enough money to move out, but I don't have a steady income.  I'm worried I will not be able to find a job.  Plus, I've got a $40,000 student loan bill to pay.

So you can see the type of predicament I'm in.  There was a time where I was living at California on my own.  I remember I was happy.  I was working, and they were working.  Going back to school had to be the worst decision I ever made.  I see myself now and I wish I had stayed over there.

Then I hold it again and count to 70. I keep repeating - usually about 10 times - until I get back to normal. I just keep holding my breath and punishing myself until I am forced to realize that I am acting irrational and that I should let the small things go. One exercise usually isnt enough which is why I do it about ten times. (Believe it or not 150 seconds makes you feel like you've just gotten hit my a bus).

I need advice.,chocolatespaghetti,14,1,40,"My ex-boyfriend and I have been dating on and off (mostly on) for almost 4 years. He was diagnosed as bipolar midway through our relationship when I encouraged him to seek help. He stayed on meds for only a couple months. He also struggled heavily with substance abuse (opiate painkillers and alcohol) and lied about it for years.

Whenever we would break up, harm himself (cutting his arms up), and say horrible things to me. Often, the next day, he does not remember the episode. He is also usually drinking when these things happen (but since it is abnormal behavior even for someone who is drunk, I am confused). Is this typical of people suffering from bipolar disorder? These episodes are what scare me the most because they are unpredictable and extreme.

I need closure. This weekend he destroyed our new apartment. When I tried to barricade myself in the bedroom, calling me every name in the book. After he left, I called the police.

I found out he was arrested tonight. The police pressed charges against him. They are strongly encouraging me to get a restraining order. One of the charges was domestic assault and battery. I am feeling guilty now. This all blew up very quickly. Am I overreacting? Should I drop the charges?

The World Doesn't Know
The world doesn't know this, sometimes its months), you don't really hear them; they're too faint and probably still exhausted from the last time they tore through your defenses. But as they regain their strength, the tormenting words increase in frequency and the number of times you see yourself losing control in your head builds.

At first its a glimpse of being quick to anger and yelling, except you're not flesh thirsty or decaying, you're just incoherent and crazy and mindless. You're smashing a computer screen with your fist, over and over you're shouting for them to get away, and you're cutting your wrists with your own finger tips. Because look at this worthless you- you can't fight against it and that voice is whispering, ""You know, you're supposed to kill yourself

All this is in your mind's eye but the line starts to blur, and unless you keep control, everyone will know. And they will look at you and they will recognize that something is off, there's a part of your brain that's uncontrollable, which is absolutely terrifying. So you pull back, push away the thoughts until they're just scratching behind your eyes and you keep them there with a smile on your face and joke to your coworker.

Words of hurt, words that you honestly, truthfully don't want to speak struggle against the restraint of your throat. They're bitter but they don't leave your tongue until they've clawed their way out of your mouth, but at least you're alone now so the only one who burdens their abuse is yourself, and that's better than him or her or them.

You're trembling and sobbing and incoherent, ""You aren't worthless, you aren't."" because that voice keeps punching words at you to convince you that you are, constantly slams you over the head with them and your head hurts and you're exhausted from fighting.

But you don't stop, that's the only way to stop nails from scratching your thighs, your arms, your neck, and whisper bible verses and hymns and ""you can get through""s.

The voices and the pounding have torn you down, and they aren't nearly as strong as they think they are or as you, so they retreat to the dark places of your mind to build up again.

In their absence, but that only means that you're still here to greet them, which is the most optimistic thought you've had for a while so you bathe in it and smile and the world is non the wiser.

We started getting into huge arguments where she accused me of irrational things and then refused to justify herself. She started making huge decisions all of the sudden--she came home one day and said that she'd found a house that she wanted to buy and was already talking to a realtor

It started to get worse. She was so distracted all of the time that she didn't have enough attention span to eat, who've all noticed drastic changes in her personality), and while she recognized that she was being ""manic,"" she didn't think it was a major issue, but at my urging she tentatively made plans to talk to a psychologist. She saw her once and had an unproductive meeting, so she didn't go again. Our marriage continued to get worse despite my efforts to be patient and loving.

That same weekend, and she was sent to the hospital for the night. By the morning, she had calmed down significantly (due to antipsychotic drugs, mostly), and she came home.

Later that week, not speaking coherently at all, and I was terribly worried for her. They took her away again and decided to keep her for 72 hours. While she was there, they gave her medication to treat her mania (mostly Seroquel, I believe), and while I believe it reduced the symptoms a bit, it made her feel physically uncomfortable.

When she got out, blaming me for sending her to the hospital. The following week was hell; it was an almost constant onslaught of verbal abuse and stress (not to mention confrontations where she got violent and physically lashed out at me), and I've been trying to counter her anger with love and calmness, although it's really taking its toll on me. All while I've lost sleep and stayed up late to do her work for her so she wouldn't get fired from her job.

She is still manic, and has claimed that *I* am the bipolar one, and that everyone around us is paranoid about her and just doesn't understand her. She still refuses to take medication, telling me she will NEVER take anything and that the problem isn't serious enough for me to even worry about it. She has been taking self-prescribed naturopathic medicine (L-theanine and GABA), and it's not improving her symptoms at all, although she believes that it does. She says she'll see a psychologist again, but she hasn't made an appointment and I'm unsure if it will actually happen. And she's said that she'll leave me if I ever call 911 again when she's freaking out (she told another friend she'd kill herself if I ever called 911 again). 

I'm at a complete loss as to what to do. She's in denial and I can feel our marriage crumbling around us no matter how hard I try. What the heck can I do? Before this all started we were happy

TL;DR: My wife is constantly manic now and I miss the person she used to be.

Yes, sometimes causing you to spin utterly out of control like a brilliant hurricane. And yet. This is what defines you. And now you have been reading that it's a defect.

First, all consuming periods. I slept little, ate little, and lost myself in the beautiful frenzy. That was the good part.

The other part, uncontrolled rage, and poor decisions. As I'm bipolar 2, it was also a lot of time spent in a dark, dark corner of my mind. This too, though, was mine. Deep depression can be it's own rather sadistic comfort, distant and muted and numb. But very

It took months and months before I was able to step aside and take an objective look at my life, and regret. The way I isolated myself, and the pain I caused those who love me most.

And when I had finished looking, and if not, to either try another or stop. This feeling of control helped immensely. Remember, *you have final say over your treatment.* 

It took a long time to slowly titrate up enough to feel the effects of the medication, what do I see?

I see a stability I've not had before. My mind is focused, no longer jumping from one extreme to another. No longer spending weeks in bed, unable to brush my hair, take a shower, change my clothes. I am finally understanding the term happiness.

Please keep in mind that google can provide valuable information, and downright ignorant pseudo-information. Learn to read things concerning bipolar illness with a critical eye, because much of it will be outdated or outright untrue.

Ultimately, doesn't it?

Remember that you are not defective. Medication will not steal away that which makes you *you*. Bipolar gives us a unique perspective on the world; several

Also, insightful, creative people that share experiences that I thought were unique to myself. It's amazing to finally feel as though I amongst people that truly understand me for the first time ever.
I hope you'll stick around and when you feel comfortable, come on by and rant away. Guaranteed, we'll understand *exactly* where you are coming from.

Anyway..
She's 27
She has always had periods of depression, people she doesn't really know or need to know. Random strangers doing something she doesn't like etc.

But now it's much worse then ever before
It has instead started to be aimed at her friends and family first, and lately myself, which I kind of understand since my mother has become very sick and I haven't been able to be there for her (my gf) in the same way for the last few months. So, troubling circumstances.

I know it's not ""her"" saying and thinking these things, and it's beginning to get hard to just accept it, it's still her saying it..Sort of. I've started to get mad, instead of trying to calm her down in whatever way that at the time seems fit.

I'm trying to get her outside again. We've bought a puppy, taking her to museums for inspiration, encouraging her etc) and all of these things have helped a lot, but that final push into ""not crying at least once a day""-land seems hard to reach.. 



Have you been in a long depression and (sort of) got out of it?
Did anyone near you help? In what ways? What would have helped

Anything I can do or say to make her ""think different"" in those really dark moments? 
Things I absolutely shouldn't say?

What should I do if I'm feeling I get mixed signals? For example ""I don't want to be touched""/""You never touch me"", so is there anything else I rather should be saying?


AskMeAnything if you need more info that could help. Any tips/thoughts/links to earlier threads on the same subject are all very appreciated.

But i cant stop it. Its not a scary obsession other than that, id never do anything extreme because i cant bring myself to be a full on creep but i just get so hurt and overly emotional


apart from that i tend to create so much drama. ill long for attention and comfort from this person that ill make up problems just so they will feel bad for me or comfort me. ill make up stories that will hopefully interest them. ill buy them things

I usually tell friends during the big ""so what all fucked up type a shit has happened to you/have you done?"" conversation which we inevitably have whilst drunk or high. It's a ritual of mine.

It's a theory that's been floating around for a long time that seasons affect folks with Bipolar Disorder, with the advent of modern science taking Seasonal Affective seriously, there's finally been some interesting developments in this area. Back in 1995 [this study](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8541932) provided a fundamental basis for the claim that Bipolar is affected by the seasons. Following it were many others, including [this](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22085482) that debunked the claim. Despite the conclusive nature of the last study, there continues to be consistent [emergent data](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19909672) linking peculiar melatonin, internal clock, and circadian rhythm genes to Bipolar Disorder. So if it's not seasonal

Well, but fail to report it or tell a mental health professional because hypomania is [chronically undereported] (http://books.google.com/books/about/Drug_Induced_Dysfunction_in_Psychiatry.html?id=pol0204fqjIC) and only about 20 percent of cases evolve into full blown Bipolar Disorder. The common traits consistently appear to be in abnormalities of the circadian, rhythm, and internal clock. Why is this important?

These set of characteristics allow for the use of [""light therapy""](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15800134) to treat SAD- specifically, there exists mounting evidence it can be utilized across many types of mood disorders for treatment as adjunct therapy with medications:
&gt;This analysis of randomized

that is [significantly faster alone](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9609674) than equivalent therapy with antidepressants alone

So why aren't people breaking open light boxes across the nation? Well, it's often so effective that the primary concern about its use in Bipolars is the possibility of inducing mania. However, in that last study, it shows that people who were on a mood stabilizer (lithium, specifically), had a drastically reduced rate of mania versus people not on mood stabilizers exposed to light therapy, and an even greater positive response (even greater!) while being empirically and consistently better than placebo (as previously outlined in a study).

So: to summarize: there exists a metric ton of evidence proving light therapy can be overwhelmingly effective in *most* patients. I am by no means insinuating everyone should go out and buy light therapy boxes; however, while adding few or no side effects of its own, while also increasing the efficacy of existing medications and reducing the incidence of depressive episodes.

In a easier to read

* reduce side effects of other antidepressants and reduce the time it takes for an antidepressant to reach full efficacy
* improve sleep patterns and reduce delayed sleep phase syndrome, as well as improving overall quality of sleep
* reduce severity of depression episodes in BPD
* improve mood while not *necessarily* inducing mania
* provide support for rough winters and offset schedules that yield reduced exposure to sunlight

**tl;dr: Light therapy is worth a look, in a very real (and not subtle) sense, way better than any vitamin or herbal supplement ever could. It's biology!**

About a week ago I took a shower at 3:00 in the morning and while showering I began to feel… incredible. Invincible. My eyes were open I felt as if I was finally moving in real time, my emotions. My brain and everything about me felt in sync. I wanted to do things, so many things, but I couldn’t handle that many things at one time. I began to work on Spanish homework that was well overdue but I only got one page done before I became bored with it and decided to do something else. I organized my room, finally got all my clothes into a pile, neatened up the things lying around. I watched a few episodes of scrubs and ate some…    the feeling soon went away…    I didn’t want it too, I never want it to. I want to feel like that every single waking moment of my life. I could do so many things, I feel I can’t handle any of them

This feeling…   is indescribable. I’m giddy, I feel like I could find the cure to cancer if I worked hard enough. My thoughts, crystal clear, tasks are so neatly organized in my brain, I can decide what exactly needs to be done and what I’m capable of doing right at that moment and man I fucking do it. It’s uplifting, it’s amazing, I reach levels of thought so deep and so provoking, infuriating slow

I’m intrigued by drugs. Inducing another state of mind and being able to control it is fascinating, I now know what to expect each time I smoke, it’s no longer a taboo for me to explore. Though on occasion it’s enjoyable to smoke and just enjoy the slowed down thoughts. I do notice every single chance in my mindset, my perception of things. I notice energy levels, motivation levels, anger and irritability with each passing hour, be it from my medication, pot, but I’ve held back on that now, drinking just because there was alcohol

I've since been forced to look at the issue not as an abstract possibility or a hypothetical but rather a confirmed constant for the rest of my life. 

Before the diagnosis I could convince myself that my episodes might not happen again after the last one. Now

Before the diagnosis I could convince myself that I had control. Now, but there is no cure and they won't ever go away. I have limited to no practical control over when I have an episode, how long it lasts or how deep it goes. And inherent in bipolar, the control I have over what things I might say or do, to both myself and those around me are equally as limited. There's still a me inside, but he get's buried among the briers that I vomit.

Before the diagnosis, I didn't dissect everything that I had ever done, every mistake that I had made, every job that I lost, every person that I hurt or every wall that I broke; it was just 'me in the past', not the 'I in bipolar.' Now, everything I do

Today, it might have been called for. But no, I get angry and anxious over the fact that she feels ignored as I sit on my computer and argue with people on the internet.

And it wasn't until I got the urge to drive head first into a telephone pole that I realized that my reaction was not only uncalled for but way over the top. 

I did eventually calm down and we did eventually talk. I ran a correlation between my reaction and my illness. But that's exactly what I'm saying: now that I know, but it's enough to dwell on.

I started lamotrigine three weeks ago. 

A GP I saw last Friday didn't consider SJS because I was complaining about Seroquel. My psychiatrist prescribed 25-50 mg of Seroquel last Wednesday to help me sleep and as an anti-manic agent.

I woke up Thursday feeling like hell: my throat and mouth hurt especially. I thought it was the Seroquel.

The sore throat and mouth ulcers/irritation are classic symptoms of SJS.  

I stopped the lamotrigine yesterday. Now I wait and see if the SJS progresses. 

My throat and mouth remain irritated and sore.

The SJS diagnosis is making me paranoid about any itchiness and fatigue I'm experiencing. 

I'm allergic to sulfanomides and pyridium. Pyridium is related to sulfanomides but I don't think it's classed as such.  Sulfanomides can also cause SJS. I wonder if my sulfanomide and pyridium allergies should have been considered when my psychiatrist prescribed lamotrigine.

This quote speaks to me because it defines the quest for self. If you think you are not going to have to fight to become authentically you
 
A man went to Carl Jung, complaining he was no better.  After hearing what the man had been doing Jung said, “But you didn’t understand…I wanted you to be completely alone.”  The man looked terrified and said, “I can’t think of any worse company.  Jung said, “Yet this is the self you inflict on others fourteen hours a day” (Manning, 2002). 

We spend our lives avoiding ourselves as if we are afraid of what we will uncover if we do pop the top and look inside.  The National Institute of Mental Health puts mental illness in America at 57.7 million people.  In 2008 Johns Hopkins released data that showed the suicide rate had increased for the first time in a decade

I am sure there are lots of reasons and environmental stimulus to push an individual to that point.  I have experienced extreme mental illness and have played the “how best to end it all” game too many times to count.  But I think that under all the layers of life gone wrong and disillusionment there is a self-hatred that eventually clinches the decision.  If you cannot love yourself

I was a hairstylist many years ago, not because we are certain, but because we are afraid that our greatest fears will be realized, that we are not worth having conversation with, that we are ugly, that there is nothing worth knowing about us.
I was forced to pop the top and look at me.  Mental illness mercilessly drove me there

I challenge you this week to cut back on your time with people and the white noise, and no books…just you and you.  Dare to do it.  You might be surprised at what you find, but go into the experience with a little mercy and no judgments.  This is not about assessment.  It’s about spending time just being and about a reckoning with you.  I'm going to head back that way this week as well.

I think this is pretty normal for depression. But even though the ideas are fabricated, but the anger still takes a while to settle. (or maybe that's just me...)

I try to be open about this to her, but that only comforts me when I am not in my depressed mindset. I think she is willing to try things out, I just don't know what to suggest. Should I tell her all my insecurities to keep them from spinning through my head ad nauseum? Some of them seem pretty awful for me to have ever concluded, and it doesn't seem fair that she should account for every detail of her life that I am construing into deviance.

When I got there, ""Help! I've fallen! I can't breath! CALL 911!!"" I called 911 and tried to get into the house but none of her doors or windows were unlocked. I tried to calm her down through her door but she was having a full blown panic attack. 

The police and EMS finally arrived and after another 5 or 10 minutes they still weren't in the house and I was of little use

Until today.

She ordered her usual again and specifically requested me to deliver it. When I got there

Inside of that envelope was the most meaningful 10$ bill I've ever received. I'm framing the envelope and the bill. 

That may seem silly but what I've realized is that, she would have died. I'm framing those items to serve as a reminder so that any time I am at the lowest of lows, I know that even if I feel useless and worthless and hopeless, I can never know when I might be the guy in the right place at the right time to save someone's life.

1369392394.0,1eypp2,My First Mania,BigBallinGPR,15,3,7,"This is the story of my first bout into mania.  I just want to share to see if anyone has had any similar experiences.
It’s been five days since the music festival and I still can’t sleep.  I’ve already purchased my tickets to go see Bassnectar perform again a few months and 600 miles from now.  I’ve been continuing to go to work at the semiconductor company where I’m an engineering intern and I can’t stop coming up with amazing ideas to pursue in regards to production control fixes.  This upcoming weekend is a four day weekend due to the fourth of July and I can’t wait for it to come.  I get off work after another amazing day at the office and proceed to head home as usual.  I am so excited to go cliff jumping tomorrow that I can’t contain my excitement.  I start jamming out to the music I’m listening to at the light and proceed to get weird looks from the car next to me.  I laugh and continue jamming
I make it home and proceed to head to my office where I’ve spent the past few days and nights watching videos on youtube and reaching out to the people who’ve created them
After cleaning up the dishes

Its super trippy and I somehow feel connected to it, everything is interconnected and makes perfect sense.  I draw one line from a realization to another, thinking of the ways these things interconnect and are meant to be.  I’m a genius.  The rest of the night continues on, with me listening to more music on soundcloud and writing the artists, telling them how I want to start a music label and that they should hit me back if they’re interested.  
The morning comes and my friends arrive for our trip out to the waterfall where we’ll be cliffjumping and swimming.  I still haven’t slept.  I show them all of the amazing connections on my calendar and proclaim how excited I am about life.  One friend seems to get what I’m saying and comments on a few of the connections and how it’s an interesting take on the relationship.  I agree and am stoked that someone else shares my new view on life.  We pack our things into the car and proceed to get ready to head out.  My neighbors are outside
	We finish packing and head down to the local REI.  Me and a friend are going to buy some Vibram five fingers for the trip.  In our opinion, why not.  We pick up parking passes for the place that we’re heading to and embark on the short trek out there.  On the way, I’m starting to feel how the music we’re listening to is affecting our immediate moods.  It’s also interesting to me to note when we drive through shady spots as opposed to light spots.   I’m convinced that something about the shade brings out more negative conversation than that of when we’re in the light.  I keep telling my passenger to make notes of the some of the things that we’re thinking up on the way out there.  “Wandering thought train of love” is what I feel we are while in my car and am stoked on it.  Rolling down the windows completely changes the dynamic of the ride and each billow is affecting my mood.  I’m amazed that I hadn’t noticed how light and sound affected me previously and make sure to tell my friend to jot down (364) because it represents the light spectrum from a computer’s standpoint.  
	We arrive at the exit and no joke, and people from my college all in the same spot enjoying what I feel to be the most beautiful day ever.  I start talking to one of my friends from college, saying how I’m never smoking or drinking or doing drugs ever again because I’m so high on life.  He questions me on it and I argue that there is no better high than being completely sober because it allows you to experience all of your senses to the max.  He shurgs, agrees, and walks off with beer in hand.  
	The day progresses and I meet an Indian fellow taking pictures of the waterfall.  I ask whether or not he’s from Gao as I would love to visit there someday.  I’ve heard about headphone parties they have there where there are 3 DJs spinning and you can select which one to listen to on your headphone frequency selector.  I take his contact info down in my phone because I really want to go to India.  Cliffjumping concludes and I depart from my group to head the complete opposite direction where my parents live.  I realize I haven’t packed anything for the 3 day weekend but I could care less.  All I have on is a shirt
	On the drive out, and says that he was at the same music festival.  He tells me that he just went and was able to get in completely free.  I am now convinced that something divine is happening to me even though I’m not a religious person at all.
