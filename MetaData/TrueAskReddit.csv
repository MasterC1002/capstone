[This comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueAskReddit/comments/1f5uso/what_work_of_literature_changed_how_you_looked_at/ca751yx?context=1) highlights the issue pretty nicely. A one 'word' answer was upvoted approximately 80 times and was the top 3rd comment of one of our larger posts. No elaboration. No interesting discussion formed as a result - people were upvoting simply because they like the book. We have a little message that pops up when you hover your mouse over the downvote button but it seems that downvoting is not the problem! (**Edit:** The comment simply said ""1984"" and nothing more)

Now, clearing up the mess so everything else is nicely presented. This does not bode well for the long-term future and this is what you all need to start doing:

* Downvote comments like the one I linked to and explain why you feel that it is unsatisfactory. Remember not to downvote because you disagree (and remember where the line between facts and personal opinions lies) but to downvote because the comment does not contribute

* Don't post these comments in the first place. Think about your comments before you post - does it contribute meaningfully to the discussion? Have I said enough or am I simply making a statement with little to no explanation? If you can't think of a few sentences to add about what you're saying then consider not posting the comment at all.

The road ahead is a difficult one for us all. Some of you may begin to find the subreddit tiresome as you see things from other subreddits leaking in and you may decide to leave (e.g. [""relevant xkcd""](http://xkcd.com/810/ ""Spammers = people posting crappy comments"")) and to that I say only this:

Do not give up or you are partly to blame for the degradation in quality. If people who contribute meaningfully

If you look at the sidebar you'll see that we don't actually have rules yet. The reason for this is that our moderation is subjective on a regular basis and each mod will often have to remove/approve based on their own opinion of what contributes and what does not. Because of this it makes it very difficult for us to lay out a set of rules for the community to follow regarding contributing positively. I'm open to suggestions of what rules we could officially lay out but at the moment it is down to how we mods feel and it would be better to be more objective than that.

Want to do more? We're looking for more mods right now and there are four positions available. To apply just send me a PM detailing your moderating experience so far (not required but nice to have)

Until we next meet

* How do you know he installed a keylogger?
  I know he did because it showed up as an add-on in my firefox addons/extensions.

* OP is a faggot and will never update or will you?

* What kind of action are you thinking of taking?

My company has a history of bouncing payroll checks.  This has happened four times in the last two years.  Each time

As you might imagine, mortgage payments bounce, the works.  As a member of senior management, it's guys like me that deal with the angry and tearful phone calls wondering when they're going to get paid and what is the true future of this company.  With the job market so stagnant, most of them feel that they have nowhere else to go.  They shouldn't have to suck this up.

But our COO refuses to address the issue.  I had to force him to have a company-wide conference call explaining this most recent mess and during that call he effectively blamed our employees for the lack of payroll funds due to poor sales performance.  He took zero responsibility for the problem and lashed out at the staff instead.

Couple the payroll issues with our COO just being really awful at his job and we are truly facing collapse sometime soon

I was once very tight with the CEO  (who is mostly absent at this point since the COO took over).  I feel I could call him and tell him what's going on.  In doing so

Everyone who reports to me is up in arms and they're waiting for me to do *something*.  It's reached critical mass to the point that should I do nothing

So

EDIT:  Hey, based on your suggestions, I'll be approaching our CEO with a list of concerns  (trying to keep it as casual but firm as possible) and then sort of brace myself for what comes next.  As requested, I *will* post an update as soon as all of this unfolds. It may be a little while, though, because as I mentioned our CEO can be a little tough to grab an audience with.

So I've been trying my best to weigh my options here but have conflicting feelings of nagging guilt and selfish opportunism. 2 weeks ago I finally bit the bullet and made a long-planned purchase of a computer device (unnamed company in case there are any employees here).

I got two shipping confirmations the next day,500. It had my name on it but after checking my credit card statement, I was never charged for this extra device.

My question is... what are my options here and how much of a bad person am I for trying to keep it? A week has passed and they've made no attempt to contact me but I would want to wait for at least a couple of months before doing anything with it. My thinking was that if I don't hear from them after that

A little background:

My kid is 5 years and a half, she's learning to add and subtract by herself, one day she counted from on to a hundred and asked me what followed, so I explained the hundreds and she went on to count to a thousand as if it was the natural thing to do. 

We just had a meeting with a school counselor at her school on behalf of her pree-school teacher who told us she would make an assesment based on interviews (to us

Another probable outcome is that the councelor recommends another school for kids with special needs - in which case we might have to see first how to round up our budget

2) An ""I agree/disagree"" vote

I was thinking about vote type 2 because of numerous discussions regarding the ""hivemind

Upvotes and downvotes are generally, point in case: the various ""true"" reddits; as well as some which function more-or-less as intended through their moderator's influence, e.g. askscience. However the comments in the majority of subreddits leave something to be desired. If a minority opinion is voiced it is usually quashed, not necessarily preventing discussion but making it more difficult to follow. 

Instead of a single vote which determines the place of a comment in the field. Why not have two? Even if the first type was still the only kind to alter the standing of a comment, and a ""dislike"" button. A comment could then be upvoted because it is interesting and insightful, whilst also showing the opinion of the general public. It has been proven that reddit is skewed towards creating bite-sized, ""flash"" posts that are easily digestible and do not require a lot of thought. Comments are often similar. People do not often give a lot of thought to how the comment adds to discussion, they might read a sentence or two, see the low score it has recieved and click to downvote. The system I propose would allow them to do so, but also enable discussion to continue. Talking about things is the only way we develop more complex ideas. (Wow

An alternate I was thinking of would be to force voters to give a reason for downvotes. 
Some pre-given options such as: trolling, etc. But also the option to write a comment reply so interesting comments aren't buried in downvotes without a response.


These are just some ideas I had rushing through my head after reading comment after comment deriding the hivemind and reddit in general. Whilst I feel like there really is no better place to go online

I'm a 29-year-old white guy. 5'6"", and not having money (or the grades) for college, went directly into the workforce, working my way up from a lowly technician to NOC manager for a Nasdaq-listed corporation. I had a couple of intense relationships from 18-22, but literally have not had a girlfriend since then. I did nothing else during the intervening years but work. Seriously, my work ethic is incredible.

A couple of years ago I quit work and went back to school to get a two-year degree in nanoscience technology. I'm nearly done with it now

But I missed out on *everything*. Nearly a decade of my life during which I didn't date or even get laid. I keep hearing from reliable sources that your 20s are the best years of your life

This didn't used to bother me. There was one woman I was more or less waiting for (we moved to different towns but always said we were ""soul-mates"" and would get back together). I never felt obligated to play the usual dating games or try to appeal to anyone else, and this only recently occurred to me. That's the degree of how delusional I've been.

Now I'm a 29-year-old single guy who's short, and hasn't had a girlfriend for seven years. *How the fuck do I get out of this rut?* I've always suffered from some level of depression, but the sheer *enormity* of what I'm up against now is blowing me out of the water. I'm seriously staying at home most nights and just crying because I feel like I can never catch back up to my peers, or my ex-girlfriends who are now married and will soon have children. What woman wants a guy who's been out of the game for that long? Tonight it occurred to me that suicide might be a legitimate mechanism used by natural selection to weed out defectives like me.

tl;dr: 29 years old, don't know how to get back to living a ""normal"" life for my age, very worried I've missed all my chances and can't ever fix things.

The rest of that lesson, in a rough shape, my main bones of contention (since then I've thought about them and refined them somewhat). These are:  

The mentality. This is probably the most used argument against surveillance; most legal systems are based on a principle of innocent until proven guilty, you are being treated as guilty even before performing the hypothetical action.
  
According to my view of democracy, you are giving them knowledge about us. As the very famous proverb says, knowledge is power, suddenly snatched from us.  
Now, my problem is the *possibilty* that they can.  

My last bone of contention is as cliché as the original argument, and who to trust. The people, or the group of persons with the power of surveillance in their hands (however they were chosen, by the government or the people)?

I'm basically talking variations of the themes addressed in [Gattaca](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gattaca)

What are your views on the whole process? Do you feel eugenics should become a mandatory thing, everyone would be descended from the 'breeding stock', so reproductive regulations could be loosened, and we'd have a society of smarter, stronger, healthier people for it.  I suppose reducing the size of the gene pool and reducing variation would make us more prone to wide spread genetic diseases, but I feel those could be fixed as long as they're caught early, the diversity should be enough.

Or do you think it should be an optional thing, while the poor still have to do it the old fashioned way.  These 'super children' would have huge advantages over their peers, perhaps to the point that their biologically natural peers can't even realistically compete anymore.  Sports would have to be segregated or basketball could easily become dominated by 8 foot tall physicists (I personally think that would be more interesting to watch though).

Or should it be banned outright?  I personally don't like this option at all.  I feel holding back the human race from reaching it's true potential is something we just can't afford to do.  There will come a time when we can decide our evolutionary path.  I'm very afraid of 'regression towards the mean' creating an [Idiocracy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idiocracy) just because those who we can't take the along to genetic enlightenment won't let the rest of humanity leave them behind.

New mods! We had dozens of applications and I have decided on three new moderators who will begin a trial run of two weeks with limited permissions.

I took over here as a long-time AskRedditor because I wanted to see interesting questions being asked and interesting comments in response. A worthy cause

While this is great and all, but I think we can still do better on the comments front. Take [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueAskReddit/comments/vmvhs/what_truths_have_you_discovered_over_the_years/), for example. A good discussion could very well occur but it's a relatively typical AskReddit submission and isn't particularly original. Some comments are decent enough but others, well, not so much. Short statements of opinion that have absolutely no elaboration whatsoever. I don't mind short statements so much but I do when it isn't expanded on.

I don't want to dwell on this but what I'd like to see is more careful voting and more careful posting. Think before you comment ""How much does this contribute? Can I elaborate any more?"" and before you vote ""How much has this contributed? Is it really TrueAskReddit material?""

Ever so often lately I hear about laws passing (or the threat of certain laws passing) that not only is it obvious they aren't serving the greater populace

More and more news talk about governments demanding access to personal data and communication information. I read about police brutality, massive corruption goes unpunished, and the ones that pay the price are the people. 

The worst part of this is, or able to understand how these laws and mandates *can and will turn against us.* More and more citizens sink into a numb acceptance state of hopelessness, and the unnerving phrase heard more and more often lately is ""what difference will anything I do make?""

So I am here to ask, and any and all of us do about it?

to give you some context

Now at about 1:50 in he starts to talk about his own experiences with people online. I remember when I first saw a video of his I didn't really like him much but people in the reddit comments *hated him*. I thought nothing of it and moved on. In the video he describes how it'd get to the point where his daily routine included him wondering what insults he'd log onto that day. If somebody would refer to his weight

This is where I paused the video and started typing this up because is this really acceptable? This person  creates content about a popular form of entertainment and some people like him and others don't. Except that some people *really* don't like him. They go out of their way to target *this* person specifically for whatever reason (I assure you that it's not likely a good one) and he quite literally ""sucks it up"". He considers leaving the industry but doesn't

You also see this with reddit. People will track you down and threaten you and your family because of something you said or did on a website. Remember when the **creator** of /r/IAmA shut down the subreddit? Did his family deserve the fallout from that? Did he deserve to be put in that situation? No. It's totally unacceptable and **totally unavoidable** at this time. A similar example of fucking with the lives of others would be the Boston Bomber suspect that reddit harassed.

Countless examples of anonymity on the internet being completely and utterly abused. Now Jim and the /r/IAmA creator are people who know the internet and know the score but I don't doubt that they've had experiences that have shaken them to the core.

Why is there no accountability on the popular sections of the internet? I understand that people want privacy

I phrased my title as such because of an idea that I had when I started typing which has just come back to me:

In order to post **anything** on websites like reddit/youtube/whatever you must be accountable somehow. If you don't like it then lurk.

I'm 31 and I don't even live with them but they still treat me like a child and a recent event has pushed me over the edge.  After I give you fellow Redditors a little insight

My mother has a plethora of psych issues she is in denial over due to a traumatic childhood.  She refuses to get help bc she doesn't think she's wrong.  She is a functioning alcoholic as well.  Her choices whilst raising me have affected my progress in life and while I am cognitant enough to recognize how and work at fixing them

She treats me like an idiot despite my college education and that I am very socio/political/economically aware.  If anyone is familiar with Brittany Murphy's relationship with her mother, talked a lot of shit about me to people, been unsupportive about important issues and overopinionated about ones that don't matter.

Enough is enough.  The tax return scandal, by the way, both parents do.  So when she filed her taxes this year she decided to get a little more money out of it than she was entitled to.

I was at my boyfriend's house working on my life's acheivement, it's illegal.  As far as I am aware, to claim a dependent that person must reside with the filer for 6 months and the filer must be responsible for their bills.  If this is wrong, I'm sorry, I must have been misinformed.  Anyhow, I told her why it was illegal.  I stayed with her 4 months last year until moving out.  I tried Tennessee for 2 months with a friend, wasn't a fan.  I ended up moving in with my boyfriend for the remaining 6 months of last year.  She never paid my bills.  I sold off my avante garde painting collection to stay on top of my bills.  She has no right to claim me.  I explained all this and she responded with ""nevermind, I don't meet those qualifications and it's tax fraud.  I don't want to be a part of it.""  She ignored me for about an hour and finally responded to say ""I already filed with you as a dependent.""

At this point I was irate.  I lied and told her my boyfriend had already filed last week and claimed me because I lived there for 6 months and he took over my bills (in exchange for helping him around the house and acting as his chef).  I informed her that her greed would result in a flag in the IRS system and we'd all be audited.  My boyfriend and I are just two 30 somethings trying to make an honest life

For years she has destroyed my self worth and hindered any progress toward being on my own.  She does the same to my younger brother

Because of their childhood

Consider holidays and family get togethers.  This decision is going to strain an entire family dynamic and I just want some quality advice on how to handle this quietly.

In this modern world, and realize that the ultimate point of life is not for any greater meaning than to perpetuate itself. While this is fine and logical, there is something that has been bothering me of late: eliminating God and spirituality from our lives; seeing only what is actually there to the best of our abilities - do these things not eliminate a certain element of happiness from our lives?

An elucidation: happiness can derive from more than just religion and spirituality for a certainty. There are still things to live for, it seems to me that there's an emptiness remaining. Before we do find love and family, what is there? A frantic search for a life partner? We can't even objectively prove that humans are monogamous creatures overall, and on top of that the functioning human relationships we hold seem to forbear and sort of actual objectivity.

What

&amp;nbsp;

Primarily

 - specific interesting IAMAs
 - specific examples of our involvement in various social movements (such as the Rally to Restore Sanity and OWS)
 - specific examples of our involvement in helping right a particular injustice (such as exposing the identity of a criminal)
 - any statistics or other hard data (Mods/Admins
 - general perspectives on Reddit from outside sources (for example [how Reddit impacts news cycles](http://www.geekosystem.com/how-reddit-controls-the-internet-news-cycle/))

&amp;nbsp;

Secondarily

- Were you the recipient of a redditor's kindness that has changed your life in some way
- Was Reddit instrumental in drawing attention to an injustice you suffered? 
- Were you scammed via Reddit somehow? 
- Did you find a job or lose a ton of weight thanks to Reddit? 
- Did you receive a random act of pizza that meant significantly more than a pizza normally should?

&amp;nbsp;

The goal here is to compile in one place a variety of examples illustrating Reddit's power of influence, share your views.

My thought: High level Cxx (CEO, opening their position to the next in line, so on and so forth, until the entry level positions open up again for the newly graduated. 

With all of these open positions there will be a focus on obtaining the most qualified person at first until its slim pickings. This, and I assume (with no facts to back up my claim), will lead to a higher standard of hiring new employees. 

While in the short term the new regime may lead to companies failing due to lack of leadership, and/or drive, it can push for those individuals on the teetering edge (complacent individuals satisfied with the status quo) to make real change for the future of the companies they work for. Whether they step up to the challenge themselves, or recognize their faults and hire new employees with the hope they can make a difference, it's my belief that this is for the overall betterment of society.

I think it's also reasonable to think that a world war now would be orders of magnitude more devastating than a world war from 70 years ago. The weapons that we have now, the trends that caused them would still be there. If the nuclear weapon had been developed, it's possible that it would be used a lot more extensively in a modern world war than it was in WWII.

Also, crimes against humanity, and crimes against peace never existed until the Allies tried to find a way to prosecute Germans in charge of the Holocaust. Without the awareness we have now about the possible atrocities that can occur under the worst of circumstances, a modern day Holocaust would be much more devastating for the same reasons that a war would be deadlier.

I am an Australian, my motivation levels have just plummeted. I never used to be like this, up until now I used to be a dedicated and diligent student. I'm not the smartest student you will come across, but I feel as if there are expectations for me do VERY well at the end of the year. 

Anyway

* I can't bear to study for more than 15 minutes at a time
* The amount of time school takes up gives me little to no time to pursue my passion (playing guitar) 
* I see no point in trying hard or spending any extra time of my day in order to get the results of my entire 13 years of school summed up into one number that doesn't even mean a single thing in regard to the university course i wish to undertake
* After deciding to take a year off after finishing this year

As you can probably see, I think I do to some extent, but I feel like I have prematurely given everything I possibly can effort wise, and from here, it is just turning into a downward spiral.

1327306528.0,osnky,Let's discuss those moments when you have a really visceral realization of your mortality and the impermanence of life - how often do you contemplate the end of your existence?,huxtiblejones,28,6,34,"I'm still a young person (just turned 23) so by most measures I have a long life ahead of me. This sounds a bit silly, and eventually death. After getting an ultrasound on my scrote it turns out I have a completely benign condition affecting the flow of blood in my nut (called a varicocele) so I can live to troll another day.

But the craziest things happened to my brain during this ordeal. Laying in bed alone one night (before having seen a doctor and admittedly super blazed) I started having these visions of my corpse laying on a metal board being slowly pushed into a fire for cremation. I had a vivid experience of my flesh burning off and my bones turning to ash and, I felt like a very small, insignificant, fragile animal on a spinning ball of (beautiful) rock.

When I was in the throes of this ""life is ending"" thought, but everything started to feel very dreamlike and fleeting. I became shockingly aware of my existence and my place in the universe, I realized that as surely as I was born I am going to die one day (like the first drop at the beginning of a roller coaster when you think 'maybe I don't want to do this'). One of the funnier highlights of my experience was a revulsion to the words 'die,' 'death,' or 'kill.' I was trying to play a game in my Steam library called Orcs Must Die and freaked out at the name and turned the game off (it's a fucking silly cartoon game where you lay traps to commit genocide upon braindead orcs).

I've had other, she was a very spiteful and bitter woman who died with fear in her eyes and a lot of regrets. I've also experienced a little fear at the thought of decomposing or being buried as well. I'm an atheist and I believe death to be a lot like the time before our birth - a lack of existence. But sometimes I ask myself how the fuck my conscious being came to be pulled out of this great void and willed into existence... if that can happen once, can it happen twice? Has it happened twice? The idea of life starts to really blow my mind, it's like a dream you would deny you ever had after your death. It makes the idea of 'permanence' seem almost pointlessly abstract, it also made me question the value of physical possessions over experiences and memories.

On one hand I felt tremendous fear

My father has just passed away at a relatively young age. I have had very little contact with him for the past 15 years, but never precluded us from seeing him. He did very little to maintain contact with my sister and I over the years even though he had a means to.

Having heard of his failing health from relatives I did call him this past week and spoke to him twice before he went to the hospital. This was the first time speaking to him on the phone in years and our only communication was a few emails here and there. He said he was in bad health but did not allude to the fact that he was dying. He had a history of alcoholism which contributed to his poor health.

I guess I'm looking for other's with similar experiences. I'm feeling more confused than sad about this situation. I don't know how to feel. Even after all this time I still resent him for not being there, but my mother has told me that even though she doesn't like showing it, she's still very hurt from him not being there for her.

Hey everyone

I thought we could start a discussion about how online content is currently funded and why advertising is the wrong model.

Firstly

I highly advise you read that article


1 - Consumers do not trust advertising

2 - Consumers do not want to view advertising

3 - Consumers do not need advertising


This view is supported by stats on browser ad blocking extensions:

- Firefox adblock - Over 197 million downloads ([link](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefox/addon/adblock-plus/statistics/?last=30))
- Google Chrome adblock

This was brought up by the Vlog brothers (two popular youtubers) who asked the community to suggest alternative funding options. That thread can be found [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/nerdfighters/comments/1adkeb/hanks_discussion_content_and_how_to_fund_it/)

To summarise, you could then send that youtuber 10p / 10 cents worth of bitcoins for that video. The reason why it must be bitcoin is because of the extremely low transaction fees of sending money (think it is 5 cents atm but might be lower in the future). If you aren't familiar with Bitcoins, check out [this video](https://www.weusecoins.com/) that explains them, and or check out the bitcoin sub reddit: /r/bitcoin

Also Mozilla made a blog post yesterday about introducing web payments in browsers. [Link to article](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2013/04/introducing-navigator-mozpay-for-web-payments/)

Small amounts of money isn't a lot for one user

I started thinking how awesome it would be if websites / youtube channels had absolutely no adverts / networks

Some benefits of this include:

- Creates a better user experience because there are no distractions / interruptions of consuming the content
- Encourages content creators to focus on value rather than ad impressions (as people will be more inclined to pay if the content has value)
- Improves the design of the internet. For example it would stop random adverts placed between content
- Means people who use adblock have an alternative way to financially contribute to the content they consume

Now all of this depends on the consumer behaviour of people using bitcoins online and the ease of sending micro transactions. However I am willing to bet that people are willing to pay 15 cents for a month's content for a website / youtube channel. Especially if that content isn't negatively affected by advertisement. But not only that

The key is that the micro transaction has to be extremely easy to setup and use, some have already made facebook apps).

1346519337.0,z6v96,How does one support gay marriage and oppose incestuous marriage?,BeforeUlysses,48,26,64,"First off I'd like to say that I wholeheartedly support gay marriage

Also note that it is not a ""slippery slope"" argument. It's absolutely ridiculous to suggest that allowing consenting adults to marry will lead to men marrying cats and cats marrying dogs, and that they should be afforded the right to the legal protection of marriage as-well as the chance to express their love, then why not a brother and sister.

There are few counter-arguments that immediately spring to mind, and this continued even after legalization in the disparity between the ages of consent, 21 for homosexuals and 18 for heterosexuals. I don't know if there have been any large scale studies done on the subject, but I know I have encountered in the news examples of incestuous relationships that were obviously NOT abusive or exploitative in nature, between two consenting adults of similar age. And so although there may be some cases of abusive relationships, it is obvious that not ALL of them are.

The second is that it somehow defiles the sanctity of marriage, I don't have time to go into, but briefly speaking the idea of ""marriage"" is a loose construct that has changed drastically over the centuries, from the polygamous ownership of women, to a institution only for couples of the same race, and then only for those of different genders. The idea of marriage having some inherent set of rules for sanctity is often based on religion, and that's a whole other barrel of discrimination.

Thirdly is the idea that it doesn't happen often enough to warrant changing the rules. Incestuous relationships are relatively rare

Lastly is the fact that incestuous coupling leads to children with birth defects. Well, homosexual couples.) By legalizing incestuous marriage you also don't necessarily have to condone incestuous childbirth, and surely if two siblings are in love they're going to have a baby if the want one anyway, marriage or no marriage. However this strays into the realities of law and it's execution in the real world, and this is intended more as a moral argument. Secondly, older women who give birth are more likely to have children with genetic disorders or birth defects, but the idea of banning them from having children is unthinkable

The poster provides evidence to suggest that feminism

It is evident that many western countries are following this same path - therefore I was wondering

I am inclined to think he is correct

&gt;~1-2 century AD: The family unit is destroyed. Men refuse to marry and the government tries to revive marriage with a ""bachelor tax"", while men become increasingly demotivated and engage in prostitution and vice. Prostitution and homosexuality become widespread.

Another poster replied with the following:

&gt;So, etc), but all those with eyes open know that this is SLAVERY and will not work in the long term. Feminism strips men of their families, thus strips them of their motivation to build civilization. It does not really matter if you call it ""feminism"", the relevant point is that any (political) movement which destroys families destroys civilization as well. You must be either blind to not realize this or evil if you don't care - even moreso if all this is pointed out to you in black and white. It's not some fake conservative whining about ""values"", this is how the world works. And rest assured, if men begin to ""slack"" in vast numbers, they will disengage and let it rot away.",t5_2s91q,True

I am a disabled veteran

Because of my illness I am unable to manage my own finances.  As such family typically takes on the role of payee (federal fiduciary.)  I received a ""back pay"" check to the tune of almost $40, when all we had was a couch, and my daughters bed.  I am an avid gamer, however I am not allowed to have money to replace it, because it runs Windows 7 which to the VA means that it is new enough, even though it will barely run modern games.

Today I learned that my step-grandmother (47 years old), and for half of that time I paid them $300 a month, which is what the VA representative said would be a fair amount to both parties.  I live in Hannibal, MO.  where rent is fairly cheap.  My grandparents in no way were placed in financial burden because I and my 3 year old daughter lived with them.

As an added cost to living in the house, avoiding her meals, that is if she even deemed it necessary to have a meal.  Sometimes, she would call ahead, and say she was bringing home dinner.  For instance, if she went to taco bell, I got a taco, my grandfather got a taco

While rules to living in a house are normal and acceptable, not so cool.

I lived in that house

However, guess how much I got?  $400.  My grandmother gets $6000 plus the $1800 I paid her, plus another $300 I was forced to pay her when I hadn't even lived in her house for a month.  What am I left with, what can I do.  $7800 for a year staying with family.  I am just blown away.  I don't know what to do.  I don't want the money given to me so I can spend it.  What I want is for her to be punished, and that money put back into my account, where it is available, should I need it.

I also posted this in askreddit but I think this might be a more appropriate place to ask it.

From a very young age I was stricken with physical illness. Unable to go to public school

I learned how to read with a stick in the dirt in my front yard.
I got my first computer at age 4
By the time I was six I was reading 20 year old+ aired out copies of tolkien

At ten I finished high school, also known as the Johns Hopkins University center for talented youth program, for a few weeks a year, for two years in a row. Even the short trips that I made stretched the financial ability of my family as far as it could be stretched, and although I saw incredible gains in my health during the short period of time that I was in california, at UCSC, santa cruz

I had three attempts at attending public school, and six. When I was placed in these grades, it was always by the basis of being near peers of my age, not peers of my education level. Apathetically cruising through the material, I never learned much, and invariably there would be some event like a kid dropping a bottle of cologne in the hallway; I miss a lot of class, I drop out. Back to the homeschooled/self taught drawing board

With the exception of the trips to santa cruz, the rest of my education came solely from the assignments my parents gave me as a young child, and more importantly the self-study I did once I had computers and the internet available to me.

In my years of illness and sleepless solitude, through comparison. This is something that most people take for granted. In many cases what may be a socially or religiously learned concept will have much less weight with me than it will with others. I'm not about tradition, I'm about cartesian doubt.

I have delved very far into the subjects that interest me: philosophy, theology, meditation, perception, solipsism, etc.
I see a fundamental flaw with the way most higher education is conducted in our universities, they tried to make it all unified and make sense, they tried to explain the world in a satistfactory way.

My belief is that the pursuit and spread of free, but this only further reinforces me on the path of education. The practice that my mind is most suited towards is asking these deep philosophical questions, in my opinion, and because it is a rarity to have the ability to ponder them in such a way, I believe there is at least some form of responsibility for me to see what my mind may produce for the benefit of the society which is supporting me.

I do not want to come off as egotistical in that last sentence, removing me comfortably enough from the daily struggle for food and shelter that others must deal with.

I'm making this post because, there is noone who really wants to talk to a libertarian, humanistic buddhist like myself. There's no real accreditation or certification of my countless hours of study to be earned; the notion that my ideas will only carry weight when I have invested enough money for my scroll of paper is alien to me.

In the pursuit of the goals I have already set out upon, trying to find some form of intellectual kinship so that I can advance my ideas and have anyone to bounce thoughts off of.. even if this means dealing with the flaws I view as inherent in our education system as it is today.

I saw comments about Romney/Ryan wanting to defund FEMA

The issue is that people live in areas that are prone to hurricane and flood damage. For the purposes of this discussion

The federal government provides flood insurance (it's the only real flood insurer in the US) through the National Flood Insurance Program. The program was designed to try and save taxpayers money in a few ways:

1) People who have flood insurance won't need to draw on federal emergency aid to the same extent as those who are uninsured

2) The flood insurance program encourages individuals to mitigate their risk of flood damage by meeting certain building codes

3) The program (through FEMA) does extensive mapping of flood plains to help individuals determine risk.

4) Theoretically

Communities are able to participate in the NFIP if they agree to follow certain zoning restrictions and undertake flood mitigation efforts.

Sounds good

But the problem is that participation is low. The government made it mandatory for individuals in high-risk areas to own flood insurance if they get a mortgage from a federally regulated lender, the taxpayer STILL foots the bill. Insured people collect from their insurance, but people who knowingly lived in a floodplain and DIDN'T get insurance still get compensated. And this means that there's very little incentive for them to purchase flood insurance unless they have to. And since there are high upfront costs to loss mitigation activities, people don't undertake them unless you pay them to do it. So although it's in the taxpayer's best interest for people to meet building codes, elevate or relocate their houses, etc, it doesn't happen because we give people little economic incentive to do so.

As you can see

So what's the solution? This is where I get stuck.

Suppose you say ""flood insurance is mandatory for everyone in the US."" Well, particularly in flood-prone areas. Second of all, you would provide incentives for poorer people to move away from coasts and richer people to move into coasts, which could create some unusual depressed areas and a whole host of potential other weird problems. Thirdly, how could you compel purchase? Who would crack down? And what if people get caught off-guard without insurance? If you then pay them using FEMA funds, doesn't that again undermine the requirement to buy insurance? But I'm under the opinion that the social safety net function is extremely important, particularly for affordability issues for lower-income buyers.

What if you had a socialized cost of flood insurance? Now you lose incentive to protect your house. People in low-risk areas are paying for people to live in high risk areas. It doesn't make sense

Finally

As you can see, then you get all kinds of weird problems with affordability and you lose many of the important social safety net functions that are so valuable.

What's the optimal solution that doesn't completely cut people loose but saves taxpayers money and is more efficient than FEMA?

I work in a small accounting firm of around 20 people. I have my own office. Almost 100% of the work which I do is on my computer, the bosses did implement a webfilter, but quickly removed it as they were uncomfortable viewing and controlling their employees web habits.


I have a long running issue with abusing my internet usage at work. I have timed my overall browsing and I average well over an hour or two per day. I have tried many different techniques including things like browser extensions like Siteblock or Stayfocused, or simply use one of the other browsers on my computer.

I have also tried some other methods such as breathing techniques to try to curb my distractions

I am constantly racked with guilt. I feel that the quality and amount of my work is suffering due to the amount of time I spend browsing aimlessly. I really want to be a more productive worker. I want to learn more about my field rather than learning trivial or banal information from the internet. I want to be a less of a scatterbrain to improve my relationships with my workmates
I have come to the conclusion that I will need to remove my use of the internet from browsing while at work to achieve this aims.
I think the best way to do this will be to ask for a filter that I cannot disable myself. I have had some success with using a browser based filter

**The issue**

I am uncertain about what the ramifications of asking for a voluntarily internet filter may be.  


 * Will my employer look favourably upon me for being pro-active with my problem? 
 * Or are they more likely to look back on my last few months internet usage? 
 * If I ask the question and they are unable or unwilling to help
 * Will my position become untenable once my employers are aware of my usage?


I guess, or am I just as likely to draw attention to my bad habits? I want to change, I know I will need help, but I am very afraid that my actions will only act to incriminating myself.

Their Corporate Asset Protections manager interviewed/interrogated her for about thirty minutes, signed the form, and was terminated immediately afterward. She was never given a copy of that form, never told of the evidence they had against her, and was never informed of an investigation. She's never had a write-up with the corporation, and has been, in the words of her managers, and there was another incident with their HR that recently caused another termination. My thinking is they're related.

The reason I give you this backstory is so I can ask you what to do next. We are both unemployed

What actions could she take against Babies'R'Us if they were proven wrong about her alleged theft? 

Would she be able to take unemployment benefits after working there for 2 years?

Some background:

I'm 20

Here are my problems:

**First:**

I didn't have a 'solid' group of friends until my senior year of high school, are people I would have trusted with anything. We'll call the closest ones S, T, and J. S went out of state for school, and T and J went to community colleges near where we live. S had to come back due to money issues after our freshman year. T moved downtown, about 30 minutes away, to be closer to school. J still lives at home. Recently, I've noticed that there is a distance growing between us. T and J both got in to relationships

For the record

**Second:**

However, I feel like I don't have a direction. I am confident in my choice of majors, but I can't confidently say that my job prospects out of school would make me happy **in the long run**. Moreso, I started a business with another friend, A, over the summer, and I love it. I love working toward it because it has *always* been a dream of mine to own my own business. However, and with a relatively busy schedule it's hard to keep up with school and my company as I need to. I would be more than happy to drop out of college for a year to get a foothold with the company, there are a lot of things I'm dealing with at school that I feel like I'm battling every day for no reason. Their existence is justified

3. The custodial parent has a new spouse who acts as a stepfather/mother.

Except we still have to deal with those that aren't quite so satisfactory

How would *you* like such comments to be dealt with? The example given has been downvoted but that's largely due to the comment that I posted. Would you like me to make it so a little notice comes up when you go to upvote? Would you prefer that I remove comments outright based off certain outlines? What would those outlines be?

Haiti democracy model is inefficient. The way the people elect their leaders, healthcare, education, employment, welfare are utopian notions for the Haitian people. ""In corruption we trust"" seems to be the motto of all public or corporate institutions in the country. Corruption is in fact the right way to accomplish anything. While the world progress, Haiti is moving backward. For every step taken forward, we make 10 steps backward. The Haitian people might be the first black country independent but we never been so enslaved than we are now. Haitian dreams and opportunities are constantly drowned by corrupted politicians and their corrupted promises, think and live differently but a reality check is always too deceiving. Manipulated elections, you would understand that resignation might be the only way to cope with the struggles. If you are Haitian, coup d'état

Justice Anthony Kennedy said
&gt; ""By seeking to displace this protection and treating those persons as living in marriages less respected than others

This landmark court hearing has opened up a lot of doors never though of before! Seen as a landmark case for human rights. But what about those farther on the fringe of human inequality?
I'm talking about incest and polygamists.

Macklemore even said himself in the context of gay rights
&gt;""Its the same hate that's caused wars, there is no difference""

Think about that for a second. Human rights for EVERYBODY. So why is the progressive movement shunning incest and polygamy, you should be able to marry. Yet people who who fall under those two categories, incest and polygamists, are looked down upon not only by the heterosexual world, but by Gay rights activists as well!

So why is the progressive movement nit picking what movement it wants to support and what movement they look down upon? If they are truly a progressive movement

Now, thats what people thought about gay marriage in the past as well. IMO, there should be no reason why the same people looking to have their rights confirmed by the SCOTUS, are hating polygamists and people who prefer incest. If anything you should support their unequal rights because they are in the same boat as you were in the past! If you believe otherwise, then you are just as bad as the people who sought to deny your right to equal marriage rights under the eyes of the law.

Along the highways I could see buildings for miles and miles, and was astonished to learn I had crossed multiple cities on the way from the airport to Anaheim, when it all looked like continuous development to me.

First question is economic. In Edmonton, engineering work, etc.). In somewhere like L.A., is it mostly based on tourism? Is the population so big that there are a vast variety of industries and such? Or where to generally most people work?

As well is it true people live in different cities and commute to other cities for an hour, with probably an hour at most for commute. I live in the suburbs (still a part of the city) and I can get downtown in 20 to 30 minutes.

Another questions: is it possible to find true wildnerness in the 'states? I'm sure there are places to go hiking, but I'm wondering if it is anything like here in Canada. Less than an hour outside of Edmonton I can be camping and hiking in a secluded forested trail, or a couple more hours and I can be in a vast &amp; almost empty forest of the foothills or actually in the rocky mountains of Jasper National Park.

It seems that if there's any element absent in Romeo and Juliet, their children had to go to exstensive lengths so that one day they may be together. Keeping that in mind, Romeo and Juliet's families essentially killed them. 

On another note, Romeo later kills Tybalt. Even though Romeo avenging Mertrucio is actually understandable, Mertrucio was killed under the most shallow of reasons. It was a shallowness so much so, that it's plain right ridiculous. 

This is my opinion, and a deep seeded blind hatred.

1361545620.0,190ue9,Abortion and contraceptives are wrong and akin to murder... according to my Catholic friend. What are good topics to bring up to show different sides of the story?,misterchief117,4,2,14,"My friend and I have gotten into a heated debate about abortion

Her stance is that every form of abortion

The initial route trying to say that the woman has the choice was shot down by her because she said that it's murder and there is no justifiable reason to commit murder.

I have brought in factual evidence and cases where abortion is not only not murder, or in cases where it's guaranteed the child will be born with significant birth defects, diseases, or will be born into a family with no financial means to care for the child. 

She retorted that ""First off

I gave a specific example of congenital heart disease, they will rarely reach adulthood. Those that do will deal with it as a life-long disease and have a much lower quality of life...especially since congenital heart disease is also linked with other defects, such as neurological ones as well. 

She basically said that it's still murdering the child and that they deserve a chance to try to live. Her stance is purely emotional.

For the sociological/economic reasons, it's true...they can join the other 150 million children who are orphaned and have no stable home. How is that a proper lifestyle? How is that fair to the majority that will never be raised and cared for by a proper, loving family? How about the huge economic impact this causes...here in the US, the costs of the orphaned children are covered by government subsidization and other social aid programs...which is ultimately paid for through taxation. (Note: I am pro these social aid programs)""

She then sent me a link about contraception and how it's wrong
http://www.lifesitenews.com/news/dear-pro-lifer-is-there-any-way-to-prove-that-contraception-is-wrong

It discusses different forms, which is akin to murder.

I haven't started on tearing the article apart, and has many other positive uses. I will also bring up points such as those who are infertile...masturbation and how animals do it, and simply how abstinence will also be wrong because it prevents fertility. 

Basically the entire argument on her side is based purely on emotion. Her arguments may hold some water if we lived in an absolutely perfect world where there is no pain or suffering or harm to others
What bugs me is that I can't seem to use any evidence-based logic as it doesn't work. Her education history consists of all homeschooling (since she moved around a lot as a child as her family is all former military and it was hard to change schools all the time).
