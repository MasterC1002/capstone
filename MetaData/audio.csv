For instance, they absolutely need to be yellow) Fostex PM0.4n speakers plus an external DAC (I have a laptop). Will the extra investment be noticeable? Furthermore, in this particular case, the T40 series has better frequency range on paper (starting at 50Hz compared to 60Hz of the PM0.4s). Can I simply deduce then that base will be better on the T40 or are there more aspects to it (more of a rhetorical question I guess, but care to elaborate)?

To put this into some context: I want to get new speakers for my home office, occasionally watch a movie or play a game. I would like to get best audio quality possible within the budget. Yellow colour is a plus!

**Edit 2:** [Results here](http://www.reddit.com/r/audiophile/comments/1eyono/survey_results_highres_vs_lossless/)

Well

Can you hear the difference between a 24/88.2 ""Studio master"" lossless edition of a song

This is something I said I would do in the [thread about the HDTracks version of ""Random Access Memories""](http://www.reddit.com/r/audiophile/comments/1et48i/daft_punks_ram_from_hd_tracks_2488_version/).  Note that it took me some time from when I first decided that I wanted to test, I had to search for a candidate clip of about 30 seconds, and I also wanted to find the right candidate, which took about 50 complete listens of the album.

I've prepared two clips of the intro to ""Lose Yourself to Dance"":

1. One from the [high-res version you can buy on HDTracks or Qobuz](http://www.discogs.com/Daft-Punk-Random-Access-Memories-%C3%89dition-Studio-Masters/release/4581717). This file is originally in 24/88 format
2. … and one from the Mastered for iTunes version

I've then prepared a Google survey that basically seeks the answer to one question: ""Which clip do you prefer, and your system settings. Note that you should only fill in the survey once.

* [Google survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1BVXFR4FLdKw8KpB6vPu2g5c5dcxfK8nwTpCsNt7GWQM/viewform)
* [Test files](http://www.mediafire.com/download/i15jzh46pza5nip/lossy-vs-lossless.zip) (25.5 MB zip) - [Mirror 1](http://media.veven.org/2013/05/lossy-vs-lossless.zip)


I'll keep the survey open until I have a reasonable number of responses, and merely asking you to subjectively tell which clip you prefer - it could take as little as five minutes, or as much time as you personally like to spend on it.

So i'm thinking about switching to a container format

* Single container for lossless audio and metadata

* Supports per-track Performer data (For Various Artist discs/ releases)
* Allows me to embed album art
* Supports higher-than-CD quality (nonstandard bitrates / sample rates)

I've been saving my pennies and at the moment I have around $6k to build a system. In two months, but I basically save all my money after future college accounts.

My favorite past time would be movies. I have a collection of about 200 DVDs (no Blu-ray yet, and I'm **very** much into music. I want a great system as far as mid-range equipment is concerned. So far, I've reviewed all of the components on CNET except for audio. That's where I get lost. Here is what I have so far (I'll link to CNET reviews, if that's okay)

1. Television: [Samsung UN55D8000 LED-LCD](http://reviews.cnet.com/flat-panel-tvs/samsung-un55d8000/4505-6482_7-34503721.html)
2. AV Receiver: [Denon AVR-1912 with 7.1 channels](http://reviews.cnet.com/av-receivers/denon-avr-1912/4505-6466_7-34647681.html?tag=contentMain;contentBody)
3. Blu ray: [Panasonic DMP-BDT210](http://reviews.cnet.com/blu-ray-players-recorders/panasonic-dmp-bdt210/4505-9991_7-34468896.html?tag=mncol;lst;2)
4. Universal Remote: [Logitech Harmony 1100](http://reviews.cnet.com/remote-controls/logitech-harmony-1100/4505-7900_7-33485031.html)

Of course, at about $2100 but my local Best Buy is about $2400 pre-tax. If I assume the ""deal"" of $2400, and Amazon's prices for the others, the total is about $3,675 after tax. That leaves me about $2,225-$3,225 to spend on the best audio I can. Just a rough estimate, since it will be two months before I purchase. Also

With that being said, there might be a pop-up) looks like it might be a great option. However, I have no idea if I'm getting completely screwed at this price point. I also don't know where to look for home audio. I don't want to sacrifice quality. I understand that I can't have an audiophile setup in my apartment with dimensions given below, but it should be stated that I do fully appreciate a nice sound, and my picky friends appreciate it even more. However, in a year that will change when I get a bigger place which will hopefully give me a better home theater. My audio equipment will hopefully last years and years, unlike my TV. Am I headed in the right direction for looking to get a great sound system? Am I completely going about this the wrong way?

Living arrangements: carpeted floors, I don't know for sure because I haven't moved in yet. Will that affect anything? Also, please understand once again that even if this ""setup"" is a little too much for the tiny area, I will be moving into a nicer place in one year.

I hope I gave enough details. Let me know if I left anything out. Also

___________________________________________________

Separate question: If I were to get something similar to this, correct? For example, if a receiver I get has about 120 watts/channel, but the tower speakers I decide to get are rated much higher, is that going to damage the system if I crank it up too loud? Will the quality degrade the louder it gets, unless I purchase an amplifier? I sadly haven't looked this up yet, and I should have before I made this post. I didn't think of the question until I wrote this, non-technical explanation.",t5_2qhms,True

What's happening is, I can hear the guts of my computer doing computer stuff. Little clicks and whirs that correspond to things happening on the screen, data being copied, such like that. It's not picking up the monitors, I can turn those off and still hear what the computer is doing. But this is only when both sources are connected at the same time. If I disconnect one of them, and it doesn't matter which one, the silence is perfect. And when I reconnect the disconnected one, it slowly ramps up. Something is building up somewhere between them. Are my resistors too low? Too high? I read that 1k-10k was fine. Should I run the grounds to an external ground? What could be happening here?

I'd like a reasonable DAC to deal with the laptop output. What I then need is this clean signal to go to the Active Monitors (which receive either 1/4"" or XLR I think

Can such a thing be achieved in one box? I've previously looked at the Fiio E9/E17 combo as that seemed quite neat for having a DAC on the go for my iPhone. I don't mind getting rid of my mixer

1357687319.0,167o26,Getting my first actual interface. Some things to think about and quite a few questions!,DvineINFEKT,5,0,4,"Hey /r/audio! It's been a while. Thanks for helping me work out my issues in the summer setting a PA for the backyard show. It was a huge success, I've used my POD X3 Live as my interface

Setting up an apartment-sized recording studio has been far less time-consuming that I want it to be. I'm a broke college student, which are the main thing I'm researching now. The main two I've decided on possibly getting are the [Scarlett 18i6, by FocusRite](http://www.zzounds.com/item--FOCSCAR18I6) or the [ProFire 610, by M-Audio](http://www.zzounds.com/item--FOCSCAR18I6) which are comparably priced. 

A few questions I'm concerned about, and it has to be durable and able to withstand the occasional ""being slammed into a backpack and hitting the road"" bumps and bruises).

- **Any other interfaces I should absolutely consider? Why?**

- The main drawback for the FirePro 610 is the necessity for FireWire, USB 2.0 - or even 3.0 (which my computer can use) - is surely the way to go, right? **Are there any USB 3.0 interfaces even out yet? What else could I be looking into?**

- One of the most important concerns I've got in getting an interface is the pre-amps. The ones on the Line 6 POD X3 are obviously not meant for heavy duty vocal recordings, or are the ones in the POD as bad as I'm imagining? Will a ""proper"" interface make the difference I hope it will?** I guess I'll tell soon enough anyway, right?

- On that note

- Those monitors I mentioned earlier, but TRS and XLR are just hot, cold, and ground lengths right? Surely there's not much a difference in quality *per se*. I feel like I might go with XLR just because they lock in, but I can't think of any reasons besides that. Just stuff to know for the future.

Thanks in advance for any responses

The trunk in my car gathers a helluva lot of condensation

I want to be able to use my car amplifier (with subs attached) with my current home sound system. I've looked at a bunch of guides and youtube videos

My amplifier has two 30A fuses

My understanding is on the PSU I can connect the PS_ON wire (green) with a ground wire (black) and then I attach the yellow wires to the positive amplifier terminal and the black wires to the negative terminal on the amplifier.

What are the risks of using two PSUs with a car amplifier and am I an idiot to even attempt it?

This leads us to my next option, instead of being attached to the chassis of the car, attach it to the negative battery terminal. Then I attach the ""remote on"" wire to the +12V terminal and I'm set. My only concern about this is, is it alright to leave the charger attached at all times, and if it were to be disconnected, how long (approx.) would the battery last before dying?

I've been playing with this thing all day and it's just fantastic.  Just google **""zoom R16""** — there's a few youtube videos that showcase it in action.

This is ridiculous for less than $500.  The only comparable product I found was by Tascam at over 800 bucks.  And that one you can't stick batteries into and record anywhere.

What it can do:

* USB 2.0 audio interface.
* MIDI controller (though granted
* You can also use it to record on the go (without a computer)
* It takes SD cards up to 32 GB (essentially a whole album.. or more)
*You can record up to 8 simultaneous tracks.
* you can record up to 16 tracks.
* you can do a rough mix (with effects and equalizers) straight in it; or dump all the tracks to a DAW and work it there.
* 8 XLR inputs, 8 line inputs, 2 built in microphones (that sound surprisingly not *that* bad).
* light and portable and the interface is really easy to use.

other shit too but this is starting to sound like a commercial.  I'm just in love with this thing.  I can take it to me friend's house and all we need to do is plug it in and mike the drums and record a whole jam session that I can take home and mix.

My main concern is whether or not I will be handicapping him with the mITX form factor and it only having 1 PCI-E slot. Is it common for audio hardware to use the PCI/E interface? I haven't been able to find much in my resarch so far. I have never built a PC for audio production before so if someone knowledgeable on the subject has some advice I would really appreciate it.

Please note that the hardware is not finalized

I currently use my PC and my console on the same display sitting right next to eachother, and (if possible) DAC/Amp capabilities as well.  Right now it's a really bad solution of splitters and adapters that just... isn't anywhere near an ideal solution.

Bonus points if:

* I can control the volume of each input channel independently.
* It has a built-in USB-driven DAC to maintain the audio quality coming out of my computer.
* Reasonably priced
* Separate AC power not required (USB power enough?)
* Works well sitting on a desk (inputs all on rear

Considerations

- Price - $200-300

- An equalizer that allows customizable presets. The Cowon S9's EQ was outstanding. Sound quality trumps everything other than price.

- Interface/ease of use - The Cowon wasn't the best. No playlist support

- Storage - Probably not a consideration

- Support of formats other than MP3 is nice but not necessary. I couldn't hear the difference between FLAC and MP3 (using Denon D2000s with a m-stage headphone amp.) Also

- Power/battery - I have a headphone amplifier to use at work and use IEMs at home so power is not a consideration. Long battery life is nice.

Support for gapless playback is a must = No HiFiMan (like I could afford any but the least expensive anyways.)

Brands

Cowon - Solid recommendation from audiophiles. Interface of the S9 wasn't the greatest

I intend to record straight to the laptop using the microphone using audacity. I've tested the equipment out and everything seems to work


1. After recording


2. How close to the mic should the actor be? (sorry if this seems like a silly question)


3. When I'm recording a voice actor. Should I record their whole part without pressing ""stop"" once


4. Once I've recorded the voice actor's lines, should I export it as multiple formats?


5. I'm going to use audacity to record AND edit the whole thing (it's around 30 minutes long) is this advisable?


6. Most of the time I was recording


7. Is my equipment choice ok?


That's all the questions I have for now

I have come up with this hair brained scheme and I wanted to know if it would work. There would theoretically be 3 channels to this setup.

**PC Sound**

The sound from my PC would go to a splitter. One side of this goes to my receiver and the other goes to the mixer.

**XBox Game Sound**
Since I play on an HDMI monitor

**XBox Headset Audio**

This is where I really have a question. My first thought is to use a 2.5mm to 3.5mm adapter on the controller itself since that port is a 2.5mm port. From there

**Side Note**
Could you recommend a mixer which will work with 3+ channels and maintain stereo sound? I'd like to stay around $30-$40 but I'm probably in the wrong ballpark there...

1351281501.0,1252fu,2.1 or 2.0 Low Budget System suggestions?,Terminus14,8,3,8,"
Hi there

I'm in a college dorm that is about 12' x 16'. The current motherboard I have selected for my computer is capable of running a 7.1 setup but with my limited space and budget

I will be using this system for everything from music to movies and games. Music genres are pretty much rock, and orchestra/choir music (I like listening to soundtracks. Hans Zimmer ftw). I need good lows for guns and whatnot in games and movies but good sound reproduction for the music. I'm afraid this will be difficult on a budget.

If my extremely limited audio knowledge serves me right

As far as connectivity goes, I'm completely forced to use my headset. If there exists a speaker/speaker system out there that would have the ability to work with my PS3, that'd be great. However, I want to note that this would be a complete extra and is nowhere near required.


As a quick recap:

* Under $150 budget but willing to go $200-$250 if REALLY worth it.
* Used for games
* Room is roughly 12' x 16'
* Sub is optional.
* PS3 connectivity would be amazing but not at all required.
* Using motherboard's onboard audio.

Such a tempting prospect and seems like a great idea for the smaller gigs where it's difficult to get the mixer into a good position to get a good mix.

I already own an iPad 

Venturing into digital mixers is fairly expensive whereas this is quite cheap really

If there is a gig where I can use the analogue desk without any issue (when cable management is dealt with by a team of crew) I will

I have a setup consisting of a MacBook Pro

On the software side of things, and I would now like to be able to route at least two of the iOS devices to separate (stereo) inputs in my modules.

Originally, desktop mixers like Behringer's won't let me do digital multitrack recording, but instead force me to premix in analog, which makes me lose individual DSP chains for each instrument.

So

1. Connect three analog stereo line-level inputs
2. I need to run whatever recording software is used as a ReWire slave. Most of the time I won't be recording anything through it, but I'll simply be using it as passthrough to the ReWire host which does all the processing.
3. As this rig also serves as my main setup, and one to the headphone amp.
4. Do any of these devices come with mixer style controls? One of the reasons for thinking of a regular mixer in the first place was ergonomics.  I don't really fancy digging through a digital interface because I want to mute specific inputs or outputs because I want to watch a video on the iPod

The software, most likely, a combination of both). I'm having a hard time trying to find ideas for the kind of hardware to use. Ideally, I'd like each room to have a separate audio device associated with it, so that we can play different music in different rooms, shut rooms off that we're not in, etc. Once I do find something, but I know basically fuck-all about audio.

Since it's bare wire, or by the computer, right? Does the signal need to be amplified before it goes into the wall? I imagine some of these cables are 15-20m. I'm not averse to spending some money, although I'd prefer not to spend a ton of it.

** Thanks to those who chimed in to help;  PST me if you'd like a month of reddit gold. **

EDIT:  The problem seems to be a ground issue between the HU and the amps.  There is no noise unless the RCA wires are hooked into the HU and the engine is ON. 

This problem has been killing me... I've got an 03' Audi A4 with the stock symphony head unit with two after-market amps in the back.  

To get signal

I made a custom RCA harness that feeds into a 4x shielded RCA run that goes down the passenger side to the main amp.  That amp has a pair of RCA out that feeds a signal to the subwoofers amp. 

The problem: Cabin speakers sound good, and the amps are in the trunk.  

The one thing I haven't tested is to see if the noise isn't coming out of the main amp; but

**A reward to any redditor who can help me get rid of this noise**; I'd be happy to provide a month of reddit gold or something similar.  I haven't been able to crank my stereo in forever and it's driving me absolutely nuts.

So I'm building a set of body microphones for a sound project, if not exactly the same. This would be good if I wasn't putting some on my throat and others on the bottom of my feet. So I basically need to reduce the sensitivity of the microphone element. I don't know though if I can do that without just decreasing the amplitude of the signal without affecting the dynamic range, if that makes sense. I'm looking into acoustic isolation for the capsule. Silicon caulk is the material I've been working with, and I think a disc on top and one below sealed around the edge could be enough, to but I want to explore acoustic and electric options simultaneously. Especially if the silicon molds I'm making don't reduce the amplitude by much.  

Hopefully one of y'all has a better grasp on the electrical aspect of microphone construction than I. As I've not found any solid literature on the subject, or other places to go look for answers. 

Appreciate the suggestions.

Oh,) I don't know what it's actually peaking at. An incremental system (ie, add this much resistance to reduce amplitude by 3 dB, this much squared for 6dB, etc.) would be ideal, but anything would be appreciated.

- Comfort. I know this is tricky with circumaural headphones since they're so big and I hear they can get hot after a while so basically all I'm looking for is something that doesn't squeeze my head or mash my ears into smaller-than-they-should-be cups.

Everything else like isolation and portable I don't really care about. I'm only using these at my desk for most likely shorter periods of time (ie: under 2 hours).

I went out and bought speakers of the brand BOSE model 161 with subwoofer (bought them second hand online for ~100 euros.) 

The seller did not include cables


1) What kind of cables will I need to buy to connect the speakers to my receiver?


2) Can I connect my DENON UD-M30 to my subwoofer?

A friend said the same thing happened to him and that he uses an ungrounded cable for his PC and this has solved the issue for him. I couldn't find one to purchase anywhere
The issue happens with both the on-board soundcard and my Steinberg U22. A power conditioner has not solved the issue either.

I've been considering making my own ungrounded cable by simply removing the ground from an extra power cable I have. Is this safe? I'd still be plugging it into a power surge.

I'm running a turntable through a phono pre-amp to a Lepai 2020A+'s RCA inputs.

I also have a 3.5mm auxiliary cable from my PC's onboard audio running through the Lepai amp's aux input.

Both of these are being outputted through Dayton bookshelf speakers

The two problems I have with this are:

1. I don't have a high quality headphone input.
2. The Lepai amp can't power both the PC audio and the turntable's audio at the same time.

I would love to have a DAC/Amp with a headphone jack (obviously) that can power both my PC audio and my turntable's audio.

**My question being**: *What piece of equipment do I need for this?*

I was looking at the Fiio E9k paired with one of the compatable Fiio DAC's
