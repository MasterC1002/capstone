In other words, both of you are *talking* all the time, and what's more, windows of opportunity for escalating don't last forever. Your rapport is great *now*, so you should escalate *now*. 

So what do you do, and you both go for a smooth kiss? In many dates/situations, there simply will never naturally occur such a situation. So here's my line preceding the kiss, romantic 'perfect' situation be damned:

***'Wait.'***

That's it. 

Whatever you're doing, or she's getting up from the table to go for a drink or whatever, just say *'wait'* as if you suddenly thought of something important, which will interrupt with a 'startle' whatever you were doing, then look her in the eyes, and kiss her.

Field tested at least a dozen of times, I'm pretty sure I could kiss her now, but I just can't find a good *moment* to do it' really can be quite dreadful. Not anymore.

1336955235.0,tlorg,My Relationship Manifesto: What To Do After You Get the Girl,Soupertramp,1696,319,254,"**Relationship Manifesto**

Hey guys. I’ve been in the community for a while now (I’ve deleted my FRs because a few girls know this account, healthy relationships that have all ended by my choosing and on very friendly, adult terms. I’m currently seeing someone new, and that is going great, too. 

Since relationships get almost no press in the community

**Contents**

1. Women want to have fun

2. Women want to feel sexy

3. Women want to feel protected

4. Women want to feel loved


**INTRODUCTION**

Relationships are like the Big Bang of pick-up. All the rules break down. There are no routines to fall back on, and open while keeping things in perspective. Bombs away. 


**1. WOMEN WANT TO HAVE FUN**

The old song is true. Girls just want to have fun. If you and your girl don’t have fun, women consistently list a sense of humor as the most desirable trait in a partner. It is really difficult to overstate how much this is true. 

**1a.** Here’s what this means for you:

Learn to have fun at any time, if you and your lady are walking, and you see a jungle gym, and she squeals and makes a break for it, don’t sulk and quietly wait for her to finish playing. Instead, run as fast as you can, push her out of the way, rip your shirt off, pounce on her and tickle her until she pees in public. It doesn’t have to be that extreme, and ask the clerk’s opinion. Tackle her into bed. *Smile. Laugh.* Make some memories

**2. WOMEN WANT TO FEEL SEXY**

This seems like an easy one, it’s a mix of four things: 1) being interested in her mind, 2) complimenting her, 3) teasing her, and 4) having good sex. 

**2a.** Be interested in her mind.

If you aren’t interested in what your lady thinks, long conversation once in a while. Ask her what she thinks and take her seriously. Again, don’t do it arbitrarily. Date women you are interested in. 

**2b.** Compliment and tease her.

Make it unique, when she walks away in that skirt you love, tell her you are about to have a stroke and you’d prefer if she just wore moo-moos from now on. Or whisper in her ear that her shoulders are giving you a boner in church. Say what you really think, and frame it in a way that’s fun. 

**2c.** Have good sex.

I’m no sexpert. I have a lot to learn myself. But having great, although it's clear he loves and respects women), but overall, it's a great book that focuses on the female psyche instead of bullshit “hum the ABCs” techniques. 


**3. WOMEN WANT TO FEEL PROTECTED**

Since you will almost never run across a situation in which you must actually protect a woman from harm

Most of the time, passionate man who is not pushed around and is generally unaffected by bullshit (even hers). It also means—and this is very important guys—finding and pursuing your own passion; if she doesn’t see that you are a man who is confident enough to do things on his own (and to let her do her own thing), she will never believe you are confident enough to protect her. 

**3a.** Real-world examples:

*Pay for her. She is your girlfriend. You take her out

*Let her pay for you if she wants to. A confident man is secure.

*Decide. Be the decider

*Physically lead her. Take her by the hand and walk through crowds. Order first (better yet

*Stick up for her. No one gets to talk shit to your woman. 

*Allow her to stick up for herself while supporting her with the quiet

*Show her you have her back by empathizing


**4. WOMEN WANT TO FEEL LOVED**

This is the most straightforward and natural for most of us. However, to apologize, or to otherwise reconcile a power imbalance. Exchanging expressions of love should be happy, spontaneous and genuine. 

So, and she loves you, tell her during positive emotional spikes. Say it when she makes you laugh or when she does something amazing. Say it when you are proud of her. Tell her you love her often during sex. The only real “rule” is to not say it to her more than she says it to you, but this is not due to some sort of misguided score system; it is simply because if she is not telling you she loves you as often as you are telling her, something in the relationship needs to be tweaked. 

Lastly, and they really go a long way. 


**CONCLUSION: A BRIEF NOTE ON BEING ALPHA AND MYSTERIOUS**

It's true: you must be alpha. But don't think of it like you did during initial stages. In a relationship, and passionate, and keep the above in mind. ""Being alpha"" is the natural result of being comfortable and healthy. 

*Mystery.* I've re-written this tiny section several times, again (and most importantly), retain a sense of self.

**INTRO**

Alright so I'm just an average-looking 20 year old guy, and I've come across a stunning scientific anomaly: THEY ARE HUMAN BEINGS, JUST LIKE US! I've had girlfriends before, and actually one of my relationships lasted for more than one year.

**THE CRUSH**

A month ago, the usual..
I thought about her all the time

**THE OTHER GIRL**

Two weeks ago, but I didn't allow myself to feel flattered. I thought that she probably didn't find any other seat and sitting next to me was her only choice. But then it hit me, I had promised myself to change, and that was something that the ""old-me"" would have thought. So I thought ""just fuck it, even though I have a huge crush on the crush_girl, I should probably talk to this one. She's sitting right there, next to me, trying to get the crush_girl to notice me as usual. What the hell am I gonna lose?""

So I assumed attraction and just went for it. I started talking to new_girl as soon as she sat next to me. A simple ""Hi I'm .. "" was more than enough to start a conversation. And then I tried to keep it going by asking her questions like what she was going to major in
I honnestly wasn't trying to get anything out of this, that I hadn't even noticed that new_girl was a pretty attractive girl.

**ESCALATING**

Then I started getting to know her even better. I tried all the kind of games and tricks I read about. Some of them lead to awkward moments and silences, you have to answer your own question too. It escalated things pretty fast and questions went from ""Did you ever get caught cheating in a test"" to ""Would you let me kiss you if I tried"". The reason why I was so comfortable talking to her right from the start was because I thought she was just a regular nice girl, I was still under the charm of crush_girl. My friends would see us talking or walking together and then tell me that I looked really ""comfortable"" and ""incredibly self-confident"". 

I got to a point of comfort where I would tease her about anything and manage to deal with her shit-tests:

- ""Oh thank you you're a life saver"". The ""old-me"" would've said ""Yeah sure you're welcome

- After an original compliment/witty reply ""Hmm how long did it take you to come up with that?"". The old-me ""Hehhehe I just thought of that I dunno I .. "". The new me : ""Woke up 5am to practice it in front of the mirror"".

- ""Ugh do you actually say that kind of stuff to girls?"". Old-me : ""What? No that's not even.. I .. "". New me: ""Nope not really but I thought I'd practice on you"" (I know

- I would say random shit and get away with it ""Yeah if you could just stop staring at my penis that would be great"". ""Ugh oh my god I wasn't I was just looking at.. Ugh oh my god"" *punch in the arm*

**THE CENTER OF ATTENTION**

She introduced me to her two best girl-friends, but I didn't feel nervous as I usually would, because this time, she's not a stranger, we know each other, and I've already gone through the hard part. I felt that I was somehow falling for her and forgetting all about the crush_girl. (New_girl confessed that she was really into me as well and we'll be starting to go out right after the exams. Right now we're just busy studying and texting all the time. We really make each other happy and like each other a lot, and that's just what I've been looking for this entire time)

We would spend a lot of time together, just talking joking around and having fun. The funny thing here is, crush_girl started to notice us, and especially me. I went from being the random loner geeky guy to being the guy who's always surrounded by 3 cute girls, just laughing and having a great time. I would catch her staring at me, because I suddenly became this interesting mysterious guy who is the center of attention. I was having much more fun than her, and she was as usual surrounded by the same small group of friends who had apparently run out of things to talk or joke about.

******
**TL;DR:**
Had a huge crush on an unreachable girl. Practiced on another girl and felt pretty confident because I was only thinking about the crush (didn't care about what would happen with this other girl
**********

**Lessons:**

*1)The crush:*
--------

""When you put someone on a pedestal, a guy once told me ""imagine her taking a fat steamy shit"". It may sound gross, but what he's trying to say is that she's just another humain being. She's just like you. And who knows, you might even be more self-confident than her.

*2)She's not the only one:*
--------

I've had a lot of crushes, and that no other girl in the world could change your mind. And you know what? That's fine. Whatever. I'm not telling you to forgot about your crush, keep pursuing her, but in the meantime, don't forget to look around you. You never know when you might find another girl that could make you forget about her. Try to meet new people, hit on random girls. What the hell are you going to lose? Think of it this way: You're improving your game, you're just practicing on other girls, how to come up with witty and smart-ass replies

*3)Hit on other girls:*
--------

As I explained in the previous paragraph, you might end up becoming good friends. And then you'll probably get to know other people through her. And the best part about hitting on girls when you already have a huge crush on someone: you will probably only care about what the crush thinks, and feel that you don't really need to be accepted by other girls. Even the beautiful ones will probably look kinda ""regular"" to you because you are so blinded by the crush. All of this will give you a huge confidence boost when you're talking to them.

*4)Become a more sociable person:*
--------

No you don't have to become the most popular guy ever

Usually girls don't like loners and socially awkward guys. Being in a group of people (and if possible

*5)Take good care of yourself:*
--------

Girls are sensitive, they're probably shallow bitches who aren't even worthy of your time anyway). BUT! That doesn't mean you can hit on girls with a 2 weeks old beard, wearing pyjamas, smelling like sweat and expect them to not reject you.
Shave. Get a good haircut. Dress properly (Check [MFA](http://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/) for help). Get rid of the bad smells. ""Never expect people to treat you any better than you treat yourself"".

*6)Don't forget that girls are human beings:*
--------

They are human beings and you shouldn't feel stressed when you're around them yeah we have covered this already. But what I want to say here is that if you hit and practice on other girls, don't escalate things too much, don't let them think that you're really into them and would like to take them out if you're not really interested. It's okay to practice, but don't hurt people, and never game a girl too hard, [you never know what the consequences might be](http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/14qyxo/fr_met_a_girl_on_the_street_three_days_later_i/)


*7)It doesn't matter what you say:*
--------

I thought about dozens of openers and lines to use the day I'll have enough courage to talk to the crush. But when it came to a random other girl, but they're not that important. Say whatever you want, as long as you look self-confident when you do it.

You're not self-confident? Well then fake it! Don't look at the floor, and assume that the girl you're talking to is as much into you, as you are into her.

**Ending:**

Well

I'd like to think that everything I said here can also help girls.

This story starts off with your typical boy meets girl (whom I will refer to as Kate) story.  I met Kate at a local book store while I was out and about.  I believe I went in to buy the hard back copy of one of my favorite books or a cook book.  That is not important.  What is important is that I spied this beautiful little Asian girl with a copy of John Keats’s complete work tucked under her arm.  I quickly worked my way over to her and opened her with a “Is that for school or are you looking for the right romantic words to say to me?”  She laughed and told me that she liked his works and it had nothing to do with her Masters.  I told her that he was one of my favorite poets and recited one of the verses from a poem he wrote from memory.  The look on her face told me that I had performed the equivalent of bringing her to a raging orgasm while she was tripping on ecstasy.   I quickly made an excuse to leave and handed her my phone while I went to purchase whatever I was buying.  By the time I had finished with my purchase I had her phone number

Over the next few weeks we went out a few times

Fast forward a few weeks and we are hanging out regularly.  With the exception of her not introducing me to her friends she has pretty much by all definitions become a regular facet in my life.  Then one of my good friends (and wingmen) called me out on it.  Damnit, ball of seething rage.  How could I disrespect her by hitting on another girl and getting a # close in front of her.  I calmly looked her in the eyes and smiled.   “Kate you know how I like when you put on that angry face, but I need you to stop trying to seduce me.  We are friends remember?”  She glared at me a few moments and told me that it she didn’t think that I would be so callous about it.  I just shrugged and told her next time I would leave her to get the number while she was around.  The next day we hung out I had brought along my friend Rob (the same wingman) out with me to play pool.  During one of the rounds I had struck up a conversation with waitress who was now slipping us free shots.  Kate had now started to find little excuses to talk to me when she came around till I decided the CB needed to stop.  I looked at her and asked her what she thought of the waitress.  She immediately gave me negative ideas and tried to down play the girl’s looks and such.  I asked Rob and he told me that maybe the free shots was to help her chances and not mine.  I decided to play this to my advantage and told Kate she would be my wingman since Rob obviously was going to be too objective tonight.   I then suggested we go approach another table of girls and get them to join our game.  The look in her face told it all.  This girl was good at playing her game, but telling her that I wanted other people to play with her toy was like asking her to put down old yeller.  She begrudgingly went over and helped me successfully open the girls.  Fellas, even at their worst women negate another women’s defenses.  Soon both tables were playing and having fun.  Here was two guys surrounded by a group of HB6s and 7s (Kate still being a 9).  Kate left after two rounds stating she needed to work on a paper for school.

Several days go by and we don’t talk and I go on with my life.  Then the other day she calls me up and asks me what I’m doing.  I told her I am cooking dinner and asks if she wants to join me.  Even though she lives about an hour away via public transportation she got a taxi and was over at my place in 30 minutes.  We sat down and had a nice dinner and decided to watch some TV.  Without asking

So the lesson I have learned is this.  If a woman friend-zones you

TL/DR: Met a girl.  Ended up being Friend-zoned.  Forced girl to experience what it is like to be friend.  She came back begging to be more.

My question is

This ultimately goes back to the concept of the **shit test**.

See, isn't bad. Most of it is about having a backbone, maintaining frame, not letting another person's actions affect who you are, and **always having the will and wisdom to walk away from a bad deal.**

See, and the prize at the end is that you get to spend even more time with an unbearable succubus.

You get into a relationship with an HB8.5, because you don't wanna lose her.

We have a word for that. It's called oneitis. And passing shit tests doesn't cure it.

Without the will to walk away from a bad deal

And the worst thing about oneitis is that it becomes how you operate in your whole life. You understand that? That it no longer extends to just you and this woman?

That there is something wrong with your LIFE if you let ANYONE mistreat you like this and you just stand there and take it?

If you're the kind of guy who thinks ""how do I pass this shit test

**Edit: I was only expecting two people or so to care about this

Basically

Starting Point
---------------
*****
I was 25, geeky kid. No real romantic involvement until my first girlfriend at 17(lasted 8 years). Had a crush on my best friend from 14-17, we hung out everyday, never really made a move(fml). I really believed no girl would find me sexy. I had never called a girl, flirted with one, gone on a date, none of that. At 25. This was 2 years ago.

However I had a lot of positives going for me. First, lot of interesting skills and a great life. I believed I had value and I trusted myself to act correctly. Second, I am a performer(actor, magician), since a young age I've loved being the center of attention, even in beta ways. This helped me be comfortable at opening and telling stories, even though stories had a lot of low value qualities in them.

Beliefs
-------
*****


* People self-reinforce roles that have worked for them in the past

From a young age, and it was how my social circle saw me, any attempt to act as the alpha or popular was met with resistance. You see this all the time, you can take a popular kid, move them to a new school and next thing you know they are a goth kid getting picked on. The ""alphas"" are not alpha by special talent or ability, they took the role at a young age by chance, and continually were self-reinforced in that role. This means your ""role"" is a **choice**

* You are what you think.

It is pretty much proven that if you constantly think negative sad thoughts, and what we think is a controllable process. If you can't stop thinking ""I'm so worthless, I can't attract a woman"", then you won't be able to.

* If you expect to find evidence of something

This is a natural process, then you will find evidence for X where you might not have seen it, and ignore conflicting evidence. If you look for Y, then same thing, meaning you might ignore X. This has a huge impact on your life, and it places extreme importance on what you are looking for and expect to find rather than the data(experience) itself. So if you go out, expect to find women who are attracted to you

* People respond to you how you expect to be treated.

Random high quality people you meet have no idea who you are as a person. No one really does, if they respond to the test then we believe them. If you ""Hack"" the system, there is no way for them to challenge you. How could Brad Pitt prove he is a successful guy and sex symbol if stuck in some bar in the middle of nowhere with people that haven't seen his movies? What would stop you from acting the same and convincing an entire bar you are a movie star?

* Focus on internal change not results.

If your goal is to get 20 #'s or to kiss 2 girls, you wonder what went wrong. Screw that! You should focus on doing your best, having a good time. Don't be outcome dependent! Just do your best, and trust yourself. This avoids collecting evidence against your progress and stops you from giving yourself reasons to fail. Often my goal is just ""Make someone smile"" when approaching a set. I always win!!!

This is the easy one. Repeat good beliefs

My persona is:

* I have a lot of women in my life
* I am extremely picky with women as my time is valuable
* I am high value, and sexual. Alpha mindset
* I often take 10's home for a night of mutual fun with no expectations
* I meet a lot of cool people in my life

What I expect and look for:

* Every girl here is trying to seduce me and take me back to her place
* Every bump
* Guys look to me to lead

Most of this stuff is easily learnable from standard pickup/seduction sources

**Edit:** I felt like an actor getting into character. I wasn't saying these things as affirmations, until I believed it completely. Even now I do this before going out or before a date just to stay sharp and focused, however it is more like remembering things about myself rather than as an actor getting into character.

####Not thinking bad things

This is much more difficult and where everyone has trouble. You need to be able to control your thoughts

I am not talking about sitting in front of a wall, but you can do it at work, in the grocery line, at a bar: anywhere, anytime. Just focus on a spot, on a sound, on your breathing whatever, until you can silence the noise. This is a skill you get better at over time

Now everytime you find yourself listing reasons to fail, but once you silence them, replace them with good thoughts and beliefs.

###Memories:

Make a list of your successes, maybe it was a wild threesome. Lock those in and force yourself to remember them, let them give you confidence.

####The Persona

Brief explanation of why persona is important over ""Tactics"". A million things you are not ready for will come up, neg, do kino all the right stuff, but don't close because it is not what they expect and not part of their reality that they project.

The Process
--------------
*****

About 30 minutes before going out, date or daygame spot. This gives you a chance to see if any negative thoughts are coming up, and practice shutting them down.

Once there, then I stare at my drink or the wall for 30 seconds and meditate, shutting out all thought. Often, I'll get some female eye contact that breaks me out of this(be aware of your surroundings). Be looking for your expectations to be fulfilled, notice the IOIs(smiles, laughs, touches) you get.

Afterwards, but once you think through them once, tell yourself ""I've learned everything I can from that, and thinking about it longer is just harmful"" then meditate and shut it out.

Along the way, getting makeouts, threesomes, etc. It took awhile and was a leap of faith to just let myself believe it. I haven't looked back.

The most asked question to any man good with women is ""So what did you say to her?"". Men assume there is some universal line that all women swoon for. I usually tell them ""Just be honest

But then I thought

""Tell me

We've all used it a dozen times, I never failed. I didn't always get a kiss or a one night stand, but I never bombed. Ever. I used it on women by themselves, small groups, large groups, every race and ethnicity I can think of and I never got blown out of the water. 

It hits everything you want: Confident

What I'm looking for is for the men of seddit to play around with this line and let me know how it works for you.

1355350235.0,14qyxo,[FR] Met a girl on the street. Three days later I had her in bed. Four days after that she told me she loved me...,FoodNinja,1459,412,265,"...which her boyfriend probably wasn't too happy about.

This was one of my first real pickups since I started reading this subreddit, which I'll try to present truthfully, the good and the bad. Suffice it to say it's a story about how powerful this stuff can be; and, perhaps, a cautionary tale about what can happen if you wield that power recklessly.

**FORTUNE FAVORS THE BOLD**

I was out for a walk on a beautiful spring afternoon

""Excuse me.""

She turned around

""Hi! I saw you over here

She looked even more startled. I extended my hand.

""I'm FoodNinja. What's your name?""

Long pause. ""............Katie."" (Not her real name

""Nice to meet you Katie. So what are you up to today?""

""......Um.......I have a boyfriend.""

I was actually relieved. She had a BF so it wasn't going to go anywhere. I could just relax and experiment

She cracked a little smile for the first time. ""Like what? Get a boyfriend?""

""What's the camera for?""

She told me about the project she was working on for class

""Oh

She laughed a little, good luck with that. Have a nice day,"" in a clear attempt to end the conversation.

I held strong eye contact and said

She stared back. ""Why?""

""Because you're cute

""I have a boyfriend. I told you that.""

I flashed a sly smile and said

Her eyes widened a little bit. I asked what her boyfriend did

""Are you serious? C'mon, and we'll have fun and no one will ever have to know."" At this point I was thinking to myself, *There's no way in hell this girl is going to give me her number.* So I was just goofing around for my own amusement, trying to get blown out to boost state for the next approach of the day.

She said

""That's fine

I pulled one of my favorite moves: I looked quizzically down at her hand. ""Can I see your hand for a sec?"" She cautiously held her hand out, and said, ""Awesome.""

Her jaw dropped. She said

I pulled out my phone. ""Give me your number. You can either ignore my texts or we can go out. It'll be up to you."" She gave me her number while I was still holding her hand

**KNOCK HER OFF THE FENCE**

A few days later I was getting ready to call up another girl I had met that week. I was feeling kind of out of it

We made small talk for a bit. I asked if she wanted to get together for coffee. ""Maybe, and she said Wednesday of the following week she ""might"" be available. She was being very wishy-washy about everything, the way a woman gets when she doesn't want to go out with you but doesn't want to actually say no. So I decided to apply the [""Knock Her Off the Fence""](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgLJTYCSYs0) principle and go for broke:

""Just so we're clear

Silence. ""....Why would you say that? I have a boyfriend.""

""I'm more fun than he is. I told you that. You don't have to kiss me back, I'm going to kiss you.""

"".....Maybe we shouldn't meet up then.""

""Suit yourself. I'll text you Wednesday. We'll go out or we won't. It's up to you.""

""If we go out.....are you sure you'll try to kiss me?""

""We'll see.""

I hung up

**THE TRUTH WILL SET YOU FREE**

That night I got off work around 11pm. I was walking to my car and checking my messages for the first time all day.

Katie had sent me a text: ""Hey FoodNinja do you already have plans tonight? If not wanna hang out tonight instead? I don't want to study""

I froze in the parking lot. Up to this point I was positive that I had creeped this girl out. In fact

If this happened to me today

I texted her back, so I dropped the PUA act and we had a genuine conversation. We walked around campus, talking, getting to know each other. We started playing the question game. I told her, ""You can ask me whatever you want. I don't lie."" So she started asking me all these questions about my personal life, which I answered truthfully. Hell, I even told her about the pickup tactics I use

Eventually, ""I don't know what you want. I have a boyfriend."" I asked about him, and it turned out he was a controlling, abusive asshole, and she was miserable in the relationship. Still doesn't make it ok, but my penis used it as justification. We talked some more, about the future, dreams

""Look at me, hey. Look at me."" We held eye contact for a long silence. Our knees touched. My heartbeat picked up. I said, ""Close your eyes.""

""Are you sure?"" she asked.

""Close your eyes."" She did. I kissed her. It was fucking electric.

She pulled away and giggled. ""Oh my god

She invited me back to her place. On the way there, ""Just relax. There's no pressure. Whatever you want to do or not do is totally fine. We're just having fun right now."" I could actually feel her melt when I said that, and when we got back to her place, it was magic.

**I'M IN LESBIANS WITH YOU**

We met up again a few days later. We picked up some stuff at a grocery store and went for a picnic (one of my favorite date templates). We ended up back at my place watching YouTube videos and making fun of each other's Facebook profiles. We started making out

I froze. The world entered Bullet Time. I tried to pretend like I didn't hear her

""I love you.""

I had started to feel like she was actually beginning to fall for me a little in the previous few days, and was going to have to deal with the consequences.

We had a long conversation about it. I made it clear that, and that my life situation made a serious relationship impossible. She told me she appreciated my honesty and the fact that I wasn't being weird about it. She told me all about her relationship, and I listened and gave her what advice I could. We talked through the night, and I dropped her off at her place the next morning. She left for Taiwan a couple days later. We kept in touch through the summer, and the last I heard she had dumped the asshole BF and was reconnecting with old friends and finding the ""old Katie,"" as she put it.

**LESSONS?**

* Be bold. I've lost attraction for being too timid far more often than for being too forward. Even if she seems creeped out

* DGAF. I was self-amused and outcome-independent because I thought her having a BF killed my chances. Ironically

* Knock her off the fence. Whether she loves you or hates you

* Tell the truth. There's nothing sexier than someone totally comfortable in their own skin. My rule is that I never lie to a woman I'm attracted to

* Take the pressure off. She's been conditioned to think that sex is a huge deal. Remind her that it's just for fun and doesn't need to be anything more than that. Being cool and nonjudgmental about sex will go a long way.

* Be clear in your intentions. If you don't want a relationship

* Don't sleep with women in relationships. Everyone has to make their own choice about it, that's one thing, but if she's actually emotionally invested in her relationship, GTFO. She'll end up projecting a lot of that emotion onto you, whether by coming to hate you (and telling everyone she was drunk and you took advantage of her), or convincing herself that she feels a deeper connection than is really there. Too much guilt, drama and baggage for those few fleeting moments of pleasure. And to this day I'm a little afraid that the psycho ex-BF is going to come at me with a machete.

*-Dave Chappelle*

Yea

Guys

When a coach of a football team sits down with his boys to give 'em **""the talk""** before the big game, a player can never truly become a great one, only an amateur at best...and I would agree fully agree with this notion.

----
***Have you forgotten all the meticulous training exercises, positioning, counter-plays, and overall game plan that is essential to every great player's (of any sport or game) success???***
----

These ""pep-talks"" of inner-game only work for people who know what they are doing but for some reason have psyched themselves out of it for the given situation. *Who the fuck do you think browses this subreddit?* Newbies

The current paradigm here: ""Blah blah blah natural this

Well good for fucking you Mr. affirmative natural. Here's your karma for sounding profound. But you know what

----

***Strategy without tactics is the slowest route to victory

*~Sun Tzu*

----

*Example of seddit's popular inner-game centered post:*

""It is up to you to decide that you are the man. Are you somehow an inferior man if a woman rejects you? No. You are still the man, you are still the man. Be completely outcome independent, present to the moment, and don't take yourself too seriously. Women will pick up on it and you will in turn, pick-up the women.""

*Example of less popular outer-game centered post:*

""Hey guys I've just used this really awesome set of techniques. When you see the HB you want at a club, who are you?' Move in with a cold-read, 'you look like a person who is willing to work really hard to get where you want to be, I bet that hasn't been all that easy for you has it?' Go off that tangent until it begins to die. Then move in with the passions and interests. Pry for hers first, then when she asks you...make an absurd, yet plausible passion and be serious about it 'I'm very much want to be hot-dog eating champion, I train every week...blah blah blah'. Let her buy into it a little before busting her balls. This is a great way to tease her. Then move on to your real passions (be ready to deliver clearly, and passionately) if the situation calls for it.""

----

*Now let me ask you

The outer-game one obviously. Because it has material

Let me say though

So I had used what I had learned from *Influence* by Robert Cialdini. I worked my way up using the ""foot-in-the-door"". I told her, we're already here you should just come in."" She was NOT having it.

""I am not comfortable with this at all. Take me home now! I am not sleeping at your mom's house. I've done this before and it's always fucking awkward and the parents always fucking come in or wake up or something! NO

I thought I was pretty fucked, **""Trust me, it will be fine""** and repeat however much necessary. 

Thank you Adam, but [insert more explaining and reassurance] finalized by ""Listen, trust me everything will be fine."" 

And ending with the victory of, and got down to business. This was a class-A example of how without outer-game I would have been fucked (and not in the way I was hoping for). 

So please Seddit

**TL;DR: Nowadays everybody wanna talk like they got something to say but nothing comes out. When they move their lips just a buncha inner-game gibberish. And mothafuckas act like they forgot about outer-game.**

EDIT: Some folks have pointed out to the sidebar or noted the plethora of old mPUA routines that already exist. I am seeking *new* content as so many others are. I don't like telling a girl she looks fashionable to open, and reddit has the best layout to deliver new material.

EDIT2: Really glad to see strong support for this guys! I'm feeling very inspired to test some new/lost styles of seduction (congruent to my reality, and testable in the field. Oh and as the name suggest, I am very very sick of white knight parades on this subreddit. The FRs I seek can and will be taboo if I can help it. But most importantly, I will pay attention to the ""why and how"" mechanics of seduction. Hope to see more of the same. Thanks guys!

However

I used to be friends with a guy who *always* seemed to know about great activities to do. If liking him as a person wasn’t enough

Be that guy. Become the expert at finding fun things to do. When you always have your plate full with fun activities

I like to ask my clients

Yes, it will be very difficult to keep women in your life. And the ones that you do keep will be *boring*.

Here are some important tips to finding great things to do every night of the week:

**Make It Your Job to Find Fun Activities**

There are a number of magazines, I sit down and go through Time Out New York. I read it like it’s a homework assignment. Anything that interests me, I put into my calendar or look it up online. I buy tickets to upcoming events. I sign up for classes that interest me.

There are a lot of other events in your city. You can Google events and your citya nd  you'll find some. I’ll list a few here

[Time Out](http://timeout.com/ )

[Flavorpill](http://flavorpill.com/ )

[Nonsense NYC](http://www.nonsensenyc.com/about/) events list

[Brooklyn Based Events](http://brooklynbased.net/event/)

[Field Trip Day](http://www.fieldtripday.com)

[Atlas Obscura](http://atlasobscura.com/blog)

[The Moth](http://themoth.org/events) storytelling

[Artcal](http://www.artcat.com/) Gallery Opening listings in NYC

[Upright Citizens Brigade](http://www.ucbtheatre.com/) improv theater

[Secret Science Club](http://secretscienceclub.blogspot.com/)

This is just a sampling of some stuff I like to do. There are also classes (art, sailing, scuba diving), volunteering, political groups, health (like yoga, hiking), soccer, trivia nights, theater

**Go Alone**

This may be the most important piece of advice here. I don’t wait to ask someone before I buy tickets to events. I’ll invite friends to some

Planning to go to events alone is great because when that second date rolls around

You can also take more risks when you go alone. You may be hesitant to invite a friend out to an event if you're worried it's going to suck. But if you go alone

**Simply Show Up**

Whenever you go out alone

For this I tell myself: Simply show up. Woody Allen once said, you can pretend you got a phone call and walk out the door right away. At least you showed up. 

If possible

**Start Small**

If you have a lot of anxiety planning and going to events alone

**Focus on activities where there will be women**

Since meeting women is part of what this subreddit is about

While it’s worth going to gaming conventions, you may find a much lower number of women at these events then say yoga, art gallery openings, or theater events. If you’re looking for new interests, put your energy toward those that have a lot of women.

**Avoid Home**

As introverted guys, there is a lot of momentum to stay there. 

Avoid the tar pit of your home. Nothing happens there. Life happens when you walk out your front door. With a little consistency, pretty soon you'll have a more exciting life than you can imagine. And *that's* attractive!

1344279382.0,xs26d,7 things I discovered from Abercrombie &amp; Fitch,CPaccount,1213,262,129,"I got a PM a few days ago from someone in r/seduction about my time working at Abercrombie &amp; Fitch. 

...Overall I didn't make much

Part of the job, of course, applies to all sales. Especially in clothing. These are some of the techniques I used then and that I still use today.

**1. Don't Be New** - This is something that I hear little about around r/seduction but has been incredibly effective for me.

...This involves seeing a girl, I'd often do this carrying clothing or going off to fold, so that she sees you (but doesn't think that you've seen her).

You're now consciously (if she was checking you out) or subconsciously (you were in her gaze

This will always make the girl you're interested in more comfortable when you begin to talk to her. This is very applicable on college campuses. If she has seen you

**2. Frame Her** - I was told this by my manager when I first began. When talking you want to engulf her frame of view without being in her face. 

...You do this by forming a V with your feet, bar, chair, etc) you want to make it so that to the left there's something, to the front and right you're completely in the frame (by making the V), and the only open space is from behind.

This gives the perception of just talking but makes you the focal point. It also makes it tougher for people to disengage the conversation (since they have to either step back or walk backwards). 

This works well in all settings. Try doing this at work. Body language is not just how you control your body from the waist up

**3. Leave Early but Come Back Often** - By framing you're asserting an implied level of dominance. By leaving early you're showing that you're in control of the interactions.

...If you're at a house party and as soon as you see the conversation is dwindling eject. Go get yourself together

Ideally you want to recognize what the peak of your conversation would be (in terms of her interest in you and your conversation) and then eject. Not eject while the conversation itself is fading. 

With practice it becomes quite easy to tell when you're about to hit this peak. 

**4. Compliment What's She's Done

...r/Seduction normally goes with a general statement about her (i.e - I had to stop you because you're so cute) while r/askwomen always stress that they want to hear what they've done that makes them cute (i.e - I love your style

An employee first taught me this using the explanation that most women, 7, or whatever. 

...Trying to tell them that they're a 9 based solely on ""looks"" most recognize is a thinly veiled attempt to get with them.

But telling them what makes them so attractive is something they are actively putting effort into (style

Of course

**5. Side Talk is the Best Talk** - We had to walk a fine line

Our stores always tried to convey an intimiate feel: dark rooms, and ""fragrance"" everywhere. 

But whispering in ears goes a little too far. So what many would utilize is side talk. It's when, slightly lean forward and talk.

This isn't intimiate, if you're wearing cologne on your neck, she'll get a slight whiff of it perhaps (although that's redundant in our stores, I know). 

**6 - Your Eyes Say It All** - Eye contact is always a major factor. But I'll be a bit more specific. Again

You *always* want to keep eye contact. You should initiate with eye contact and not break it until she looks away. Eye contact is always the first prelude to intimacy. 

BUT, especially in the wrong setting, can be a bit odd/creepy. 

So how do you break eye contact without breaking the intimacy that you've built up?

Don't look to the side! She'll think you're looking at someone behind her

Don't look down! It's a sign that you've lost interest

Look just slightly *above* her. This breaks the eye contact but nothing is implied by looking above her. Especially if you're taller this could just be you stretching your neck. But it does break the *feeling* of eye contact so you can reinitiate it. 

**7. The In and Out** - No

...This is something I first picked up from the movie Alfie (the new one

You should, at least initially. 

When you're telling her a joke, bend forward (if she's shorter than you) just a tad, and say your joke/secret/whatever and then step back smiling. 

This works *really* well with sarcasm. I'd normally say, ""We actually spray cologne in here all the time. It doesn't just naturally smell this way"" then I'd lean out. This would always get a ""Oh, *realllly* I never would've guessed"" type response. 

Breaking intimacy, making her heart beat a bit quicker, and then quickly snapping it by telling a sarcastic joke instead of a true secret. 

**That's it...**

So that's it. Hopefully these help you out a bit. I still think about them and apply them whenever I'm out and about. Doesn't matter the setting.

1354223930.0,140j3l,[FR] Field Report: Coffee shop daytime approach parlayed into insta-date,Curls4TheGirls,1180,235,156,"So this is my first field report. I'm going to try to point out important moments along the way instead of just narrating my experiences. I hope someone finds it useful.

The Scene: A new coffee shop that opened in my neighborhood. I'm a writer and have been going there to get work done (and look like the soulful, jack up your inner game, and go for it.

Anyhow

On about the fourth time she looks up

Me: ""Hi

Her: ""What do you mean?"" She makes a confused face.

Me: ""I mean

Her: ""I guess?"" She looks a little apprehensive but not skeezed out

Me: ""Well

Her: ""Haha. Yeah

Me: ""I'm taking a big chance here.""

Her: ""What

Me: ""Yes

I do indeed have another power cord at home and go retrieve it. When I come back

Her: ""I only had to beat up

Me: ""I so totally owe you. I'm J----."" I reach out to shake her hand. Initiate the kino in a non-threatening manner. 

Her: ""I'm K-----. And for the record

Me: ""Your coffee is gone. Can I buy you a hot, but that's retarded). 

Her: ""I think I can handle it. How about a small skim latte?""

Me: ""Whoa

Her: ""That's just the first step. I'm dangerous."" (Now I know I'm fucking golden. We've gone from bantering to sparring

I go and get her latte and ask the barista to do the foam in the shape of a heart. When I return

Me: ""You pretty much bankrupted me with this."" She notices the heart and I say

Her: ""I'll bet she just has a thing for you."" (She subtly recognizes my value.)

I take her hand and look at her all super-serious and say, like, a whole five minutes."" (Escalate the kino, further plant the idea of us a couple.) 

She laughs pretty hard at the joke and says, it's beautiful.

We talk for about two hours, we're getting pretty serious, but I'm not sure I'm ready to meet your parents,"" and, ""Darling, I can still remember the moment we met as if it were yesterday."" She eats it up.

I was having an awesome time, my apartment is just around the corner).

I finished by saying, seddit), and right before I left I moved in totally nonchalant and planted a small kiss on her lips, as if I'd done it a hundred times before (we were pretty serious, after all). I smirked and said, ""See you soon, my love."" 

And then I walked out of there on a fucking cloud.

**UPDATE:** First

Seddit, and took so little effort on my part, that I can't even call it a field report proper. 

She planned the date (as I told her to) and we went to a local bar for a playful, and there were go-go dancers in leather so that's a plus. We dropped the whole ""we're a couple"" bit as an unspoken, as it seemed a little weird to carry it on. But the ""real"" chemistry was still there. Even amid all the peripheral sex of the bar we were in, we continued some excellent conversations we'd started in the coffee shop. She's a cognitive science PhD student and we had fantastic, geeky conversations about brains, minds, and computers. Even if we find out we're not compatible in the long term

After we got a little buzz going, and she stayed until...what time is it now? About two hours ago. Anyway, this is not a forum for bragging...but I'm still a little giddy so consider this my one little piece of braggadocio.

One of the commenters said that the above technique is great if you're looking for an LTR. I couldn't agree more. I enjoy casual sex

For everyone who said ""this is too good to be true, etc. There's a reason I didn't post an FR until this one - there weren't any that really seemed awesome enough to post.

As for whether it's exaggerated: No. This is exactly how it went down. I chalk it up to stumbling on someone with whom I have awesome chemistry -- after hundreds of approaches.

1374694265.0,1iz5l9,[FEMALE PERSPECTIVE] Signs that a girl will be receptive to approach,-all-that-glitters,1214,275,216,"So I thought I’d deviate a bit from my first two posts (^please ^don’t^hate^me). Instead of describing some approaches I’ve experienced

Ok this is a lie, want guys to take their numbers, and eventually want guys to confusedly navigate their virginities with on their (hopefully respective) wedding nights. If that’s what you’re into.  However, you’ll all be reassured (and ferociously aroused) to learn that I am not religious and so can offer at least some insight into the ‘desire for male genitalia’ node of the female brain.

**Things sneaky bitches do to sneak their way onto your penis**

* **Eyeball the club**

I know that most guys are not likely to make a move when I am in the middle of a four girl deep haggle, I will **position myself on the outskirts of the group**, and **allow my eyes to wander the club** in the hope that someone fancy will catch them. Similarly, when dancing, I may take a bit more of my own space than the rest of the group, and will be a bit more erratic in my positioning (i.e. **not always facing towards the middle** of the dancing circle). Annoyingly, if you do make eye contact with me, I’m just not built for this. *Phew. Ok. Look at him. He’s not fucking Medusa, you may proceed to pound town.**

* **Separate ourselves from the herd**

Women do everything together, **it’s unlikely to be an accident**. Of course, there are always exceptions: some women give few fucks about their gender’s norms and will pee when they bloody well need to and not when their girlfriends do, thank you very much. Other times, an unfortunate drunk girl will genuinely lose track of her friends. But I would always take this with a pinch of salt, because in the past I have actually **purposefully lost my friends in my valiant pursuit of the D**. It gives us an excuse to get approached and an excuse to approach ourselves (by enlisting the help of you lovely gentlemen). Which brings us on to…

* **Approach you for LITERALLY ANY BULLSHIT REASON WE CAN THINK OF**

‘Hey

Sometimes, where your phone? Get it together!’.* I don’t smoke, but *I actually miss that some of my friends used to* because asking for a light is one of the easiest indirect openers there is. This has created an ongoing internal battle between the desire for easy openers and the desire for my friends to not develop cancer.

The important thing here is

* Similarly, saying she likes your dancing, asking for a sip of your drink. She is doing this for no reason other than she wants you inside her. In her vagina.

* **Get ‘accidentally’ all up in your business**

I’m not saying that every girl squeezing past you in a crowded club wants to spin on your dick. But the next time it happens

Finally, as far as you can tell you’re getting along well. You all know that you can’t have all four of them (ok, you can, but you know what I mean), so at some point there is going to be some kind of interaction between the girls to decide their next move. They want to find out who’s interested, who’s enjoying talking but doesn’t want any more than that, and who’s not feeling it and just wants to go in and dance. A lot of the time, thumbs up/thumbs down signals

This is such a pervasive problem that my friends and I eventually got sick of raising our eyebrows ambiguously at one another behind men’s backs and actually developed a code to use in such situations, where’s Sarah? I haven’t seen her in fucking ages’. We do not have a friend called Sarah. The other girls can then respond with one of several options:

* ‘I don’t know

* ‘I don’t know

* ‘I don’t know

I know. It’s almost entirely transparent. But please bear in mind that we have had ten vodka oranges and it is all we can do not to blurt out ‘ELIZA HE’S TOTALLY YOUR TYPE YOU SHOULD TAKE HIM’.

If you can catch on to the body language/codes the girls that you’re with are using

Thanks again for all the feedback you guys

Around here, not a fish."" This is true, but the real reason goes deeper.

From a woman's point of view, this translates to ""How would a guy attract me?"". The answer to that question is obviously ""Be the kind of guy I'm attracted to."" So invariably the answer women give to the question is to become the kind of guy she's looking for. A woman will typically list a number of traits she finds appealing and tell the guy to acquire those traits. 

Or the advice may be confined to the much-maligned line ""be yourself"". When put into practice

No woman is looking for some sort of chameleon who'll conform himself to whatever he thinks she wants. Such a man would be a puppy dog

The real answer to the question is to become the best version of yourself

What women really want is a guy who possesses all the qualities she's looking for *because he actually is the guy she's looking for*

So that's why it's a terrible idea to take dating advice from women. You don't want to make yourself into what she says she wants. That's working backwards. You want to make yourself into what *you* want to be,False,,t5_2qhrv,False,,,t3_1aafq3

Too many opportunities are slipping through your fingers because you aren't making the move. So you learn new strategies that are edgier

But then it happens. You meet a girl you really like. And things seem different now. Even though she's not getting sexual with you

* I want a wholesome

* I want true love and a relationship instead of just sex. True love means that even though she isn't into me yet

* I didn't make it clear to her that I'm interested in her as a person rather than just interested in her sexually. I'll take her out on some respectable (sexless) dates to show her that I really like her.


* She's waiting for me to act more boyfriend-like before she gets sexual with me. I'll play the good guy for a while and she may get sexual with me later.

* She only dates guys she's friends with first. I'll just chill. I'll become friends with her and make the move later.

* She comes from a different culture where girls are more modest. I'll give her what she's used to

* She's shy and doesn't trust people easily. I'll win her trust and later she'll open up to me sexually.


The underlying idea is this:

* *I've found a great girl. I'm going to try to invest emotionally with her and let her invest emotionally with me. I'll leave the sex for later

There are two big problems with this strategy. 

**First, your emotional investment makes you careful and inhibited around her because you don't want to lose what you have with her. So it becomes almost impossible to make the move to get sexual later. 

**Second, careful, sex-free demeanor bores her. 

Instead of letting this girl off the hook in terms of sexual investment

Sexual investment doesn't just mean sex. It could mean sexual banter. It could mean physical contact. But whatever it is

If she is unwilling to get sexual with you early on, is that really what you want? It isn't. Don't try to be friends with her if you are interested in her sexually. That will just lead to problems for you. 

Typically

When you meet a girl you really like, it's not worth the investment on your part, no matter how great she seems.

Shameless self-plug: If you aren't meeting women you really like, teaches you everything you need to know to get past your fear of approaching women.

To start

Here are some things that have worked well for ***me***.  Keep in mind that I don't really follow a lot of the key ""rules"" here on seddit (not that I think they don't work

* When I meet a girl I like I try to change contact information with her as quickly as possible.  If you let her go home without getting her number

* I joke around **a lot** with girls that I'm interested in.  It's usually to the point where they tell me I joke **too** much and they don't know when I'm being serious or not.  I like to use a lot of sarcasm and make fun of myself and the girl I'm going after.  I honestly think this is the main reason I get laid.
* I'm a huge loner and hate being in large groups.  So when I meet a girl for the first time I'm almost always by myself.  Subsequent dates will always be 1 on 1.  There are a few restaurants where I'm a regular so I sit at the counter and am friends with all of the staff.  This is where I meet most of my hook-ups.
* I always ask them loads of questions about their personal life but I **never** bring up sex.  When they ask me questions about myself I try to keep the answers as short as possible.
* I very **rarely** use kino when I first meet them.  The most kino I'll do is a handshake.  I'll only start to use kino when I have them back at my apartment
* When I meet them again for our first ""date"" I **always meet at night and keep it short and fun**.  Usually I'll take them to play pool or billiards
* For the next meet up I make it a goal to bring her back to my place (at night) to watch a movie.  I haven't cooked dinner for a girl during a date in over 3 years!
* During the movie is when I go heavy on the kino, hands). 
* **If a girl flakes on me twice
* Having a good guy friend to go out with who is really laid back and easygoing is a godsend.  I said before that I almost always go solo
* **I treat all the girls that I meet with respect

**Approach 1: The average guy who got it right (K-close)**

This approach happened within literally two minutes of entering the club: I was **totally sober**, this shit can get inefficient, so **if a girl is not receptive she will simply not look back**. A girl who looks back (and does not look fucking pissed) can be assumed to be at least a little receptive to what you’re going to do next, so make it good. 

HG6 smiled. He was taller than me and stepped towards me to emphasise this, grabbed his hand, and managed to twirl him (after navigating some understandable confusion on his part). Importantly, the guy took this unusual turn of events completely in his stride, didn’t act uncomfortable with the effeminate nature of the move **(to be alpha is to not care if you look alpha)**, and proceeded to lift me up and spin me round a few times. This could have been alarming to do on a random girl, but, he did some **successful calibration** and knew it would work fine. He put me down but **let his arms stay around my waist** like it was the most natural thing in the world

* K: (in feeble protest) ‘I only just got here! I literally walked in the door two minutes ago!’

HG6: ‘Wow

**Frame change**: I am now the one chasing him. 


* K: ‘You are one super hairy man.’

HG6: ‘The doctors tell me that without this I would essentially be a dolphin.’

Thinking about it, I laughed. Just goes to show that **it doesn’t matter what you say if you say it with ample balls.**


* Throughout the interaction I was protesting that a) I was sober and b) my friends were waiting for me. HG6 was able to distinguish these **superficial anti-slut defences** from legitimate excuses and calibrate his responses accordingly. He teased me for the sober thing (‘Oh man, I thought you were different…’), which prompted me to want to **qualify myself** because no girl wants to be the boring lame one. As for my friends, all he actually had to do here was point out that they were already out of sight (strike one for the sisterhood), but had they still been hanging around a simple **‘do you mind if I borrow your friend for a second?’** would have worked wonders for their and my own comfort levels. The K-close was natural after this as he was already basically embracing me and had been for almost the entire interaction.

As a side note

‘You made out with my friend like ten minutes ago...’

‘Oh yeah? The one with the pink dress?’

‘Yep.’

‘No way! You’re so funny

This guy has balls the size of watermelons and is living the dream.

**Approach 2: The attractive guy who got it wrong**

HG8 was tall, and which I was eventually forced to intervene in because it got just that bad. Now, I am not the Mother Hen type; I will abandon ship on my girls left right and centre when they need some alone time with a potential suitor. But this guy’s game was so bad my friend requested urgent rescue.

The initial approach was not bad: he came up to our group with an **indirect opener** about how to get outside (we were on a boat).We had no idea, etc. Throughout this interaction he seemed awkward and on edge. There was no attempt at kino or even any kind of playful conversation: he was in **nice guy interview mode** and we were neither challenged nor engaged. After five minutes or so, we explained that we were going to go and dance and he followed us upstairs. **We danced. He did not.** After about 30 seconds of awkward standing, he approached me and began to ask me more interview questions, before asking to be introduced to my friends. Relieved of my escape, I introduced him to the rest of the girls and continued to dance. He decided on his target (let’s call her C) isolated her a little way off from the group, and continued to interview her for about fifteen minutes. After ten minutes, but we ignored her because this is funny. After a few more minutes though, and she did…but still he hung around her for the next hour, but he declined. When he tried to interview C

This guy was suffering from a fairly extreme case of **failure to calibrate to his environment**. The venue at was an Ibiza reunion party boat, at that). If the girl is high energy in a high energy environment, she don’t want no low energy shit from you! Bitch want to be SPUN AND SHIT.* This is incredibly important for night game and is something that Tyler describes perfectly in [this video] (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kd3Rs9FxguA) at 2:30. 

**Typical mistakes of guys with zero game** 

This is stuff a lot of you guys already know

* *Physical persistence to the point of inciting terror.*

So you use The Claw on me, protesting ‘hey hey wait a second, you don’t have to run away, just talk to me for a second, ok?’ you ignore my steadily increasing expression of panic. As a rule, if the fight to keep my attention has become a battle of strengths, IT HAS GONE TOO FAR. We are now just duelling. Please let me go.

* *Orbiting. You ain’t satellites
 
We see you watching us from the sidelines of the dancefloor. We see you accidentally dancing ever closer to us as the song goes on, right now you are purely here to stalk us, and that is not at all attractive…so don’t be that guy. Be the social hub, surrounded by people, making his own damn fun, and make us feel lucky to even get a smile thrown our way.

* *Buying girls you don’t know drinks*

Either you’re trying to buy my attention

* *Insistence on dancefloor approach despite complete unwillingness to dance*
 
If you absolutely refuse to dance, LEST I STRIKE YOU.

Aaand that’s all I can think of for now. Hope you guys found something of use in here! :)

It was a week before my 18th birthday and I remember wanting nothing more than to spend the day with 'L'. She was a wonderful girl that I had been seeing for the past two months. We had amazing chemistry and things had really heated up after we went to prom together.

Looking to keep the momentum

* Her: What are you doing for your birthday?

* Me: As long as you're there

* Her: I don't really know...I'm not sure if I'm free on your actual birthday either

* Me: That's totally fine
What days are you free next week?

* Her: Not too sure yet

* Me: Ok

Later in the week, claiming that she read her schedule wrong and had dance class the whole afternoon. I was obviously distraught. Awkwardness ensued and we never spoke a word to each other again.

I spent the rest of that summer frustrated

1. Maybe she's seeing another guy.

2. She's been really involved in dance lately and that's her priority right now.

3. She probably just isn't into celebrating birthdays. She was never enthusiastic when I tried to plan with her.

4. There must be an issue in her family/friends/personal life that made her cancel on me last minute.

5. Maybe it's that time of month?

**Never did I consider that the reason she didn't spend my 18th birthday with me was the fact that I had effectively cut off my balls during the 'planning process'

My problem with L was that I constantly sought her approval for all that I did and worse

* Her: What are you doing for your birthday?

* Me: Heading out to SixFlags. I'm getting a group together this week. You in?

I guarantee that she would cancel whatever dance class she had on my actual birthday and we'd have a blast.

So

I'm going to keep this mentality regardless of the outcome I get. What if she really couldn't come along that day? Who cares. I'm going to grab 3-4 friends and enjoy my birthday. Sounds much better than what I actually did: Moping around at home wondering what I could have possibly done wrong.

I'll never have that one back but I've come to terms with it and derived an important life lesson. I don't need the approval of others to get what I want. 

Women have a sixth sense for assessing a man's conviction and how badly he needs to feel validated. L did a good job of running for the hills as soon as she realized that I didn't know how to live for myself. I've found that women are willing to compromise on many fronts-even looks, but will not tolerate a man living only to appease her.

I hope you enjoyed this story-it was definitely long but I think clearly illustrates what every man needs to do. Decide what you want, learn from any mistakes and move on. I sure did and for that I am the most grateful.",,False,,t5_2qhrv,1345987051.0,,

My girl and I talk about what attracts people and why people do things. She told me some things and noticed that some things were clicking finally. So I thought I would share some things.

Notes:

* **Girls don't get romantically involved with safe guys who are not exciting to them.** (classic nice guy syndrome)

* **Confidence is not about being right but assuming you are until otherwise proven. Don't second guess yourself unless you absolutely should.** Don't be a douche about it. If someone can prove you wrong then admit fault and go on about your business, or at least don't argue for a long time because it doesn't matter. Being confident doesn't mean be arrogant, because arrogance means you are not confident in yourself enough to admit fault. **Don't be a douche, be confident.** [further explanation](http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/s3kgi/quicktips_i_find_important/c4au9st)

* Women **don't** want a guy who is always agreeing with her. She likes to be teased. Not insulted. Fake insults are teasing.

* Women want a guy with wit

* Being likeable does not mean the same thing as exciting or cute.

* When you are drunk you are saying and doing things you want to say or do. Have the confidence to say and do those things when you are sober.

* When girls say let's just be friends

* Most females that want to be your friend genuinely are actually secretly interested in you. The other small percentage that genuinely want to be just friends are actual confident women who just enjoy the companionship.

The thing is, events, etc. Also need to tease more. Women love to be teased. They love the roller coaster of emotion between a real conversation and some teasing mixed in. They don't want all teasing and they don't want all serious. Got to mix that shit up. They are real people. You love to tease and joke with your friends but women you get a bonus feature. You get to be more intimate with the jokes and conversations. This is what makes them want to jump you. Be careful because when you get good at it you are not going to be able to get the women to leave you alone. It's sorta funny after a while. But for now you don't got to worry about it. Move forward till you see that you have mastered this shit.

Become more fun.

---

**Until you have repeat success with women you don't want a gf.** This means just date a lot of people. Dating is just a series of dates. Dates are just things you do with a person you could possibly be attracted to. Date / dating are just words that give a weird connotation to things. Stop worrying about it.

**You want to be good with women before you settle down.** If you don't you are going to suck ass with your gf and eventually you will get married and she will then later get bored and angry with you and leave you for a fun exciting man. It doesn't matter if you are stable. **Women need excitement.** You would be bored as shit if your woman was stable but boring as fuck.

---

**Most people do not give themselves permission to be themselves.**

I have a few guy friends who aren't good with women because they don't give themselves permission to be awesome around women and they think they have to do certain things. Tweak

A few tricks to get your brain to say you can do things:

* Assume she is already into you. Honestly if she is on a date with you

* Think as if you are not allowed to game the girl because you already have one. This enables you to be who you are and not care if she is into you or not in which gives you the supreme ability to do whatever the fuck you want. This is a damn good reason guys who are married or are dating women get more attention. The persona they show is who they really are.

* Realise you get to live once and when that chance is gone you are dead. This should enable you to enjoy life and what it allows you to do. Life is the ultimate sandbox game. You get to do whatever it is you want and it is set on the hardest level possible. Rock that shit. Good chance you won't die from a conversation with your date.

When I go out dancing and playing pool I wear super silly hats. This tells my brain that everyone already now knows I am a goofy fucker. I no longer have to try and hide that because my cover is blown. I then get to act as I want without recourse because I can only go up from there.

---

* Don't worry if people don't agree with you if you know they are just being incredibly sensitive. You can't always have people agree with you. Just make sure  you do your best at being an awesome person for yourself. You can't win them all.

* If she is a little upset and not wildly upset

* If your woman is upset and you know you didn't do anything you can usually cheer her up by telling her you care, changing the subject all together to something she must dwell on in order to properly converse. **Transfer the energy from her shitty thoughts to good thoughts.**

* You can never be sure if someone gives a shit. You can only be sure of what you feel in that moment and yourself. Stop worrying so much about what people think of you because that only makes it worse.

* If they cheat you probably should move on. That doesn't mean you can't be nice to the person. Everyone has their own issues. You may forgive

* When a girl says something fucked up and you know if you answer the question logicaly in which you should never have been asked

* The power of the word ""no"" is fucking amazing. You really can't answer the word no. So if someone says a bunch of things and they are looking for an arguement and their entire arguement is just one giant shit-test kind of thing, and delivers the hand of God to their face. You then can move on from there to other topics of conversation or just walk away.

* Women will please you much more than they expect to be pleased. This may become frusterating. Don't worry about it. The balance is a bit odd with this. (My woman does amazingly huge amounts of things for me and yet I can't think of enough things to do in order to express my appreciation to her for them. So I just be kind and awesome for her. That seems to work.)  Do not get tons and tons of gifts. It will become expected. You do not want that.

* **We are to become the best version of ourselves

* You may think you are an introvert. Try to be extroverted for a period of time. You may feel physically exhausted. If that ends up being the case after a few months of trying to be extroverted you probably are physically introverted. This is OK. Alpha is about mindset

* Being nice doesn't mean you are exciting. Women need excitement. Even the nice girls.

* Being Alpha doesn't mean being douche.

&gt; Speaking of douche... my woman calls me a douche or douchebag sometimes as a tease. She doesn't mean it but it is hilarious. You can make so many funny comments out of it. 

&gt; * Douche. ""Wheres my bag?"" You don't get a bag.

&gt; * Douche. ""You asking me to clean out your dirty vag?"" lololol / hug / kiss

&gt; * Douchebag. ""bigga-bagga-douches (sounds itallian haha)""

&gt; Have fun

* Everyone has a different background

* Everyone has a battle. Don't freak out on people so much.

* The golden rule states that you should act unto others as they act unto you. It doesn't state that they will recipricate. Don't count on it or you will be sorely mistaken.

* **Do not dwell on the ideal outcome of the situation**, not the future ideal.**

1327467396.0,ovn0w,Life hacks/Pro Tips/Bro Tips,Just_Another_PUA,992,167,227,"So I've had this idea to start a thread about tips and tricks that aren't directly related to bagging whatever girl you choose, perhaps we can get it on the side bar. So here are a few things I've learned over the years... 

**Bedroom**

* Cleanliness is next to godliness. Keep your place *clean*. I don't mean it has to pass the white glove test at all times, it's always better to go to *her* house when it's time to get down to business, but we all know that's not always possible. A nice looking pad goes a long way in getting you to your goal. 

* Your bed is important. Invest in it. I've had many, a decent looking bed frame, and an incredibly comfortable mattress make a world of difference. Besides, you spend a third of your life on that thing, don't skimp. 

     - To go along with this, if she stays the night, she's comfortable.   

* On a related note, but every time I go out, I do. When you bring someone home, every little thing helps. 

* Have an extra pair of gym shorts handy. This is what I typically sleep in because they're damn comfortable. Some women like to sleep naked. Some like to sleep in just their underwear

* From a comment below: Candles are awesome. Look nice, however, keep them right next to your bed. Take it from me, if things get crazy, a spilled candle and a small fire can be a mood killer. 

* Get a dimmer switch for your light. Some girls like to see everything. Some like it pitch black. In my experience

**Bathroom**

* I don't let any girl leave things at my house for obvious reasons. However

     - Toothbrushes. I buy a bulk pack of cheap soft bristled ones for girls that stay over

     - Wet wipes. Two reasons: Again

     - Saline solution. I wear contacts. So do many women. They'll appreciate it if you've got it. Don't wear contacts? Shut up and buy some anyway

     - Hair dryer was listed below by puaCurveBall. I'm not generally one to let a girl shower at my place

     - Clean

     - As I mentioned in a reply below, regardless of what you use.

* In my bathroom I have a small decorative little jar type thing. It's filled with little sample sized packets of advil/aleve/aspirin/whatever. Always good for helping quell a hangover the next morning, and chances are pretty damn high that she'll use your bathroom at some point, she can help herself to them. 

**Logistics**

* Condoms and lube: keep that shit near by. I have a night stand with a drawer on it. Guess where those goodies go? When it's time to get busy

     - In addition

     - Going out for the night and want to have some condoms and lube handy but aren't sure how to carry them? Best way I've found: Get some [trial sized lube samples](http://www.cheaplubes.com/liquidsilk10ml-foilsample.aspx) in the little foil packets. You can easily fit that, and not as goofy as keeping that stuff in your wallet, which you're probably going to be bringing out a few times over the course of an evening. 

* Water. After a good romp

* Music. Seems silly, Pretty Lights, etc. (I've got Pandora One so I don't get ads. Kinda funny when you're going at it and all of a sudden you're getting sold car insurance, though.)

     - Additions from others: instrumental hip hop, but you get the idea. 

* Taxi drivers: know one, I talk like crazy and get friendly with the driver. As such, I've got the personal cell numbers of a guy that ""forgets"" to start his meter until halfway through the drive for me, and another that will let you choose a song from a list and sing it to you on your way home. Always entertaining. 

* Even if you don't smoke

**Kitchen**

* As Trooper below said, broke, and doesn't know any better.""

     - Vodka, rum, tequila, and both type of vermouth (dry and sweet) should always be around, as well as a bottle of red wine (someone mentioned shiraz although I'd go with a merlot), and a bottle of white (my call is for pinot grigio on this one as well). 

     - Mixers, coke, diet coke, cranberry juice, OJ, margarita mix, and maybe some redbull. Get the coke in cans, instead of a large 2 liter

     - Learn how to make a few basic cocktails if you don't already know how. Margaritas, martini, etc. A shaker isn't a bad thing to have around either.  

* Keep some easy to make snacks handy. If you're going to be cooking a dinner, and time, and get your grub on at home. Cheese and crackers, and little microwaveable things from Trader Joe's tend to work well for me. 

     - As puaCurveball suggested

**Car**

* Are you driving? As karlbarx noted

     - When I used to drive every bloody day

     - I also kept $20-$40 in cash in the glove box for those situations where I happened to be without cash

* Per sithyiscool's suggestion, in your ride, with a decent looking change of clothing in it. A few toiletries (mouth wash, hair product, etc.) probably wouldn't hurt either. 

* A spare phone battery and a car charger are always incredibly useful. 

* Tide-to-go stain sticks are amazing. Get them and keep one in the car.",,t5_2qhrv,True,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/ovn0w/life_hackspro_tipsbro_tips/

I, I was kind of a boring and socially awkward horny dude with no friends. Thats all changing.

About six months ago I really started doing things to improve myself

Up until about a month ago I was still struggling to approach women until one awesome weekend. I'll try my best to explain what happened over the past month, and Kate and I decide to hang out. Typically I don't get 1 on 1 time with her so I'm pretty stoked about this.

She arrives at my place, I assumed I was completely friend zoned. She brought a friend over to hang out, meaning she clearly doesn't want me alone. I was a little irriated and totally made the worst of the situation. I rolled over for this girl, and let her invite MORE girls over to drink with us. Soon enough, there were 6 girls at my house, me and a couple of my roommates. I couldn't get it into my head that there were 6 HBs in MY house, all I could think about was the fact that this chick was using me and the location of my house to pregame for her night of partying. 

Then in comes my savior, I'm gnouwn, and you're in my house"". It just came out, mostly out of anger, but for whatever reason this was the key to the night. The rest of the night Helga was trying to prove herself to me. Every time she said something, I would ignore her or tease her and by the end of the night she was practically begging me to have sex with her. I was ignoring her because I genuinely did not like her, and she started to like me because of it. After I kicked them all out, saying Helga was way into me (no shit) and I respond saying that I don't do booty calls this late.

2 nights later this same group of girls come over, and immediately one of the new girls who doesn't know Helga starts to try to cut in and start talking to me. We will call her Mary, and she is a HB8. I hit it off with her pretty quick, but she is the one initiating conversation, I didn't have to do anything. I get a call from a friend at a party who wants me to come over. So I get this group of girls in my house and head to the party.

I finally realize what is happening as I walk up to the front door of the party. I am about to go into a party, all these people want to be me. Not 5 minutes after entering I make eye contact with a HB9 accross the room. *All these guys want to be me and all these girls want me.* I don't think twice about it and walk straight up to her, no idea what to say. I smile and say ""You're pretty"". She responds ""Is that your best pickup line?"". I say ""Yeah, and based on the smile on your face I think it is working"". Conversation continues. I won't say it was perfect but I got her number :D

I leave the party after a bit to head home

Oh and remember Kate from the beginning? After seeing how high value I am, and we slept together :D

**edit:** Here is more on what happened with Kate that some suggested i edit in.
Kate was texting me not stop all week. I had this ongoing joke all week that she was secretly an alien, and eventually the other 2 went to bed. I sat with her on the floor and talked for a while, eventually we started playing footsie and her body language was clear.

I was actually kind of nervous at this point, but I wasn't going to force her. I turned around and walked straight to the room without a second thought. I was happy enough that I had a good night, and I knew she was into me. I may have wanted more but was content with what happened. Not 5 minutes later she was in bed with me and I was removing her clothes.

1351724972.0,12fdkk,"What dating companies DON""T want you to know about pick up. ",MaysonNSS,1127,335,218,"Over a year ago I sat in my computer chair typing a goodbye post to the readers and customers that I spent 5 years of my life teaching and working with. I tried to explain why I was leaving a company that I built with no plan to ever return.



Today I am sitting that same chair trying to type a post that I have wanted to share with people for over a year.  There is A LOT of bull shit that SOME coaches and companies shove down the throat of the consumer to SELL you shit. I am here today as in insider to dispel that BS and give you actual advice and I'm not going to charge you a dime or make you visit my website because I want more hits. Out of all my 5+ years involved in the dating scene &amp; teaching these are the most important lessons that I could EVER give anyone. 



**1) Your Appearance Matters

Dating coaches like to say that looks don't matter and thus work on your game. They are liars. Looks matter for more reasons than you know. First off, you just want it to fill the void until you can upgrade, welcome to the world of women. 



Secondly



Lastly



**2) Attraction isn't something you do

Want to know how to build attraction? Become attractive. Words, banter, all this BS people shove down your throat isn't what women find attractive. What women find attractive is **the person delivering these things**. Attraction at its core is self confidence and when you actually talk TO a girl instead of talking ABOUT her, you are starting to teach yourself confidence, this is why approaching works, it teaches guys to overcome their fear and replace it with confidence. 



**Here is how to become attraction rather than ACTING like you are attractive.** 

Develop a since of fashion and look good EVERYTIME you walk out that door. 
Take care of your body
SMILE like you know something they don't. 
Watch and study people who are attractive
Slow down. Relax
Make eye contact with people. 
Socialize with people. 
Do fun things in your life, learn about wine, scotch, culture. 



**3) Men tend to look for sex objects and women tend to look for success objects.** 

Success comes in many forms depending on the woman evaluating the man. Coaches and companies drop the ball here because they don't tell you how to actually KEEP the girl interested. Guys, you might want to work on that.  Because women usually don’t go to Goodwill to have sex. Fix your life before you fix your game. Success starts at your home NOT at the bar. Keep your house/room clean, smelling amazing and NICE. Don't know how to do that, fucking learn. /r/malelivingspace 




**4) Confidence is Almost Everything.** 

Coaches and companies miss the mark here when they try to sell you lines rather than the truth. The truth is, you must learn to create it in your own life. Confidence is the key to unlocking the rest of your goals in life. I spent my entire life learning how to create confidence in my own life and I can say that it has been among the greatest gifts that I have given myself. 



**5) Being a Value Giver.** 

How we value ourselves come through in the people that we talk to, religion and attractiveness to you, you are bringing people up rather than putting them down like so many others do. There is a lot of negativity in this world today but being a person who gives value is about giving freely without expectation or reservation.  An arrogant man insults and seeks to make himself better than others around him and a self confident man seeks to better the people around him. Why does this matter when it comes to women? If you have to ask that question, you are already doing it wrong. Giving value to others is about THEM, not YOU. If you have to ask what is in it for me then you are already being a taker rather than a giver. When you give value to others you come from a place of selfLESSness, not selfishness. When you seek to better the people around you, you will notice a lot of other things fall into place, TRY IT.




**6) You Don't Need A Coach or Company To Teach You.**

My students never needed me, the dating coach NEEDS you or they are broke. Why am I telling you this? Because you should expect more than old rehashed lines and routines from the people you pay money to. There are MANY good teachers and companies out there and I encourage you to find them if you want a coach but know that you can do this 100% on your own.  If you work on developing a sense of style, hit the gym, eat right, socialized and be a willing participant to break the walls of fear that have kept you from succeeding you WILL be successful with women.  



I could write several articles on many other things regarding this topic but I will finish here by saying the following. Life is meant to be lived outside the confines of a message board. Pursue the passions that you have inside of you because life isn't a dress rehearsal.  When you find what you are passionate about you awaken a fire inside of you and women see that. Passions will come and go

No

""Why?"" you ask, but it's a fun place to be when you're with friends and want to have a good time. 

That is EXACTLY the point. You're going to go in there and not be attracted to any of the people in there (like how a 9 or 10 might feel going to a club with her friends). And you're going to get stares from/ hit on by a lot of guys that you have absolutely no interest in (this is also dependent on how physically attractive you are

How do I know all of this? Because I go to gay clubs all the time, male version of that stereotypical, bitchy hotty that won't dance with anyone at a club. Not because I'm actually that bitchy, but because I know that ""nice guys"" aren't really that nice, guys who seem to have huge egos actually don't have that much confidence and are over-compensating, and I don't just sleep with anything with a pulse. You know what kind of guy really gets me though? What kind of guy that I'd actually consider going home with? One who I spend the night talking to instead of dancing with. One who can hold a conversation and my attention. Not someone who is overflowing with ""confidence"" or who is the center of attention, because if you ARE the center of attention it's probably not for a good reason.

...and immediately crashed and burned. I went through all the rookie mistakes: One-itis. Nice Guy Syndrome. The Pedestal. Chasing her. Buying gifts. And most damningly

So I got my ass handed to me righteously. I got dark. I got sad. Then I got up

I am thrumming. I am alive with excitement and hope. I know that failure is temporary, to learn, and to act on those lessons. All that negativity I felt earlier was valid, as a lesson. But I am not condemned to be that negativity, to live in that darkness. I have all the tools to keep growing and glowing. They have always been there, even when I was blind to them, willingly or unknowingly.

I do not need to stumble and grope after women, and there is only one of me.

I am the prize.

I will build a temple of myself, ambition and dedication. I will decide the course of my life, and persevere with my own interests in mind. I will not need to chase my dreams, for they rest firmly in my hands. I see proof of them with every authentic action I take.

I am the prize, she was never meant to be to my liking, and I thank her for not wasting my time. There is no woman worth compromising my authenticity, for the second I do so, I am no longer the prize.

I am the prize. It may be frustrating at first

Because I am the prize. How do I know I am the prize? I prove it every day, unceasingly, to be the best version of myself. I strengthen my body. I sharpen my mind. I explore the world with an insatiable curiosity. I do not allow mediocrity to seep into my life. I do not allow others to choose my identity or decide my destiny. I make mistakes, and I laugh at them, because laughter is one of the best things there is, and then I learn from them, because a mistake is just a lesson clothed in temporary failure. I have one life

Simply put: I demand excellence of myself—why shouldn’t I demand it of women? Love is crucial to life, a life filled with adventure and effort and passion, will be large enough to hold love and keep it burning, without crumbling under its weight or being consumed in its fire.

I don’t worry about them

I am the prize.

**EDIT: Wow, but this post comes from a place of humility. I thought I could be The Prize without doing the work, and life served me a huge slice of humble pie. Woe unto he who shirks doing the work. To better yourself, you must understand your faults. So I owned up. I started doing the work. I realized that doing the work is the source of all that is good in a man's life.**

**Being the prize is not about unreasonable self-aggrandizement. It is about commitment to becoming a better person. It is about taking PRIDE in having the strength and perseverance to make that commitment. If you choose, righteous path of being better than you were the day before, then I salute you. And you deserve to feel damn good about yourself, to feel valuable, to feel sexy, and to feel like women would be lucky to have you.**",,,,
1343417207.0,x9gku,"Gents, women ARE NOT the root of all happiness. They ARE merely a perk that comes from leading a fulfilling, interesting life. ",Frisky_Flamingo,964,91, learning a great deal in the process, like many of you

You see, it left a whole in my heart, that I was convinced could only be filled by having a women in my life. So, for months I obsessed over this miscalculation, letting the perpetual pursuit for a significant other take over my life. I dreamt about finding a girlfriend  at night, i day-dreamt about finding one while i rotted in school and i fantasized about it when I got home.

Inevitably, so abnormally fast, that it would scare them off before any sort of relationship could develop at all. The worst part was that, in the chains of my naive delusion, I had no idea why this was happening. 

Once it began to happen over and over and over, as you can probably guess, only further compounded my failures with women; and, as a result, I holed up in my house, blocked out my friends, family and whatever passions I had once enjoyed

It was then, in my present state of mind, I would have no chance with women even if I knew all the tricks of the PUA trade. Women can sense when a man has an abundance mentality, happiness, confidence and passion and, you know what? I had none of those things. This might well be the most important realization of my life. I finally recognized that I was undesirable to the opposite sex, **NOT BECAUSE I'M UNATTRACTIVE OR AN INHERENT LOSER**, for lack of a better term

*I had limited myself to a solitary goal in life: meet a girl.* Now tell me, would want to date someone who only cares about one thing in life? Weather it be a job, a person, a sport or what have you, if one's life revolves around one thing, especially if that one thing is meeting women, the opposite sex will not be interested in you past a shallow attraction! 

Sure you might have the odd good night where you get laid, while fantastic in the short term, will not make you a happy, fulfilled individual. Life is not all about women or sex.

Since I learned this fact I have worked tirelessly to improve myself in all facets of life. I've hit the gym 4-5 days a week and I dieted

I've taught myself a multitude of new skills, blogging and slalom skiing. These things have consumed so much time that I no longer even have a mili second to think about that aforementioned hole in my heart, and I have become a much happier person. My mom wouldn't have wanted me to pout about her loss, or come up with ridiculous ways in which her absence could be compensated for, she would have wanted me to live a fulfilling life and I'll be damned if that's not what I'm going to do! But I digress.

Wouldn't you know it that, using daygame, in my whole life. Moreover, now, when I approach women in the club, I have a story to tell, I'm passionate about many things and have no limit of conversation topics. I have confidence in my appearance and an abundance mentality to boot, especially women. 

But do you know what the kicker is? I'm so happy with the way that my life is going right now that I am completely outcome independent! I used to dwell on my failures, I have 0, I repeat, 0 fucks to give when it comes to picking up women.

**Now that I have no fear of failure, I win. If I don't go home with a woman, I still win because, as I said before, I don't give a fuck. My happiness does not hinge upon the success of my sexual endeavors. 

So gentlemen, because, in that case, when you fail, it can be painful and all consuming. Especially when you have nothing to go home to but thoughts of your own shortcomings. 

On the other hand, interesting life, even when you do lose with that member of the opposite sex, you still fucking win, baby. You go home, cook yourself a fantastic meal, read about slalom skiing technique, and realize

**The moral of my story is that if you work hard

* Above all, buy them a taco. Have chat. This pays dividends.

**Approaching**

* Just fucking do it. Right. Now. Direct, sometimes it isn't. Do both, be confident with either way. Walk up, stand in front of them ""Hi. I'm here to steal your purse.""

**Conversationing**

* Try to make everything unique, use every day, and try to rephrase it to something unique and funny. If you can't be original, download lesser known stand up albums, listen to them, and just rephrase what they say conversationally, until you can do it yourself. I love Patrice O'neal and Russel Brand. Both very alpha (and incredibly successful with women) as opposed to a Louis CK who is a beta

* Be emotional, grab you strongly, and shake you like a magic 8 ball to get the answer? I don't think you want that"" *Sly I will fuck you right now smirk.*

* Callibrate, fuck that. I'm going to upset you, I might even use the word cunt as a noun, or cunty as an adjective. Don't fucking apologize for this, use it as a chance to make things sexual and CORRECTLY dominate the frame. The go to line here is ""Don't worry, I'll make it up to you. I give great massages""  from one of the top posts in this sub.

* Snap come backs - sometimes you have to say a comeback

**Tailoring your game.**

* I've gamed in English, and failed in sign language. In the 7 different countries, completely different areas of the states I have been to game can wildly change. game != game != game. Pick up the intricacies of your area, and incorporate them, but don't let it rule your game. Be firm, but flexible, and anticipate how people will react differently to you.

**The Company you keep**

* The most overlooked aspect of this whole thing, and happy. Win these people over in EVERY aspect of your life. If you're surrounded by good looking, rising, happy, people, you're doing a lot of things right.

* New hobbies. Get them. Yoga pants are awesome bro.

**Sex**

* I was really good at sex. Really fucking good, and could guarantee I was one of the best fucks of their life. This fucked me up. I was so ultimately concerned with their pleasure, that I didn't care about mine. My pleasure came from their pleasure.
* My girlfriends and girls I was with: They. Never. Fucked. Me. I'm not joking. Even elation can be boring. She could sit on a god-damned sybian (what are those upside-down horse cocks called?) and get pure robotic
* Instead, how much they're turning you on. Do you know how validating that is that you can make someone feel amazing? Like they're reaching the mountain top because of YOUR looks, and YOUR skill, and YOUR body. Make the girls feel like this. Girls CRAWL back to me now, and want to fuck me so much more. And you know what? The sex is so much worse for them than it was back before this. Change your frame brother.

* Gentleman's wash. If you don't know what those words mean. Look it up. not at work.

**Non Judgmental attitude.**

* This took me far too long to figure out. Stay away from jokes that are judgmental of other people, so long as it's funny and it works. But actively create a non-judgmental attitude ""What, I thought this was the trust tree."" You would not believe what a comfortable carefree environment has gotten in terms of crazy sex, because I was the knowledgeable, non-judgmental guy.

**Set the frame early**

* Picked this up from 50 Shades of Grey. Start telling her what to do very early on. ""Hey, and telling her to do stuff. After that you can then bust out the ""Take your pants of. Now."" and win.

* a note on the frame. Sometimes you need to take it to a level unknown to you. I have a story from 2 weeks ago, and she was a little drunk and denied it. I saw it. My response? ""I know you did it, stop acting like a child.""  ""I did not!"" She pulled out some sort of fake anger, and I did not take the high road when I replied: ""SHUT THE FUCK UP. RIGHT. NOW. I HAVE TO FUCKING CLEAN UP AFTER YOU BECAUSE YOU SPILLED THIS SHIT ALL OVER MY CAR."" She shut up, and when we went into her place she had the look. that piercing gaze. That one. We then fucked like drunk monkies all night.

**Rejection**

* Don't start hating women and thinking they're all the same. Every person is going through different shit at different times of the day/month/year. Fuck, ""I want to fuck you"" opener? I probably would have wound up in prison. Not because of the guy coming up to me, but because my body was still in fight or flight mode and I would have taken it out on whoever entered my space. Just remember, timing is important, and girls aren't being bitches, they're acting like that because they're worried about losing face in a social situation. Sometimes they're just bitches.

1371647851.0,1gnind,Why Your Text Game Sucks,bl1y,923,208,187,"We’ve all seen this post, what happened? What do I do?”

For some reason this reminds me of 18th Century medicine. “I’ve been sick, what happened? What do I do?”

The problem is that you were taking soluble arsenic

Same thing with text game. Your text game goes down hill not because you weren’t doing it well, but ultimately kills it.

Try to see text game from the girl’s perspective. A guy you met and kinda liked sends you a text message. It’s funny or interesting, it’s all good, but at some point you’ve got to get on with your day. It’s becoming a chore to keep responding to every nagging message and that guy who you thought was cute now seems like he’s starved for attention. You know that if you reply he’s going to reply, and the whole thing will just keep going.

So as a girl what do you do? Odds are you just start ignoring his texts. Either you ignore them mid-conversation or you end the conversation but when he texts you again a few days later you ignore that because you know what a giant time sink texting with him will be.

**Logistics**

The key to good text game is to see texting as just a logistical tool. It’s not for conversation

Ideally you will only send one fluff message before you start arranging your next meeting. Set a hard limit at two

This is a tough lesson for many guys to learn because it takes them out of their comfort zone. They’re used to communicating through instant messaging, talking face-to-face with a girl is foreign, it’s hell on the nerves, and you might say something stupid and screw it up.

Too bad. Attraction is built in person

**But I Know Someone With Good Text Game!**

Yeah? So do I. It happens. There are also tons of documented cases of people in the 1700s being treated with arsenic and fully recovering from their disease. That doesn’t mean it’s a good idea for you.

You can work on texting to round out your toolbox

If not, but it’s just rare, highly refined …arsenic, and it will never perform as well as some generic mid-grade penicillin. It’s just not the right tool for the job, just like even the greatest text game will never be a substitute for the clumsiest experience opening sets.

**The Great Time-to-Anxiety Converter**

The last thing I want to say about this is that you need to beware text game because of its ability to wreck your life. I regularly see guys agonizing over what to text. They’ll spend hours trying to get those 140 characters just right

The medium of texting is just far too conducive to converting your time into anxiety. In person you get about half a second to think, and she’s busy worrying if you think what she’s saying is stupid. And if you did say something completely boneheaded? You get instant feedback instead of worrying about how she took it and asking all your internet friends how they think she took it, and should you send another text following up, how long do you wait, do you acknowledge the stupid thing you said, blah blah blah.

Just think about the more productive uses for your time.

**A Simple Guide to Body Language**

All right

**1) Your mother was right - stand up straight!**

Slouching is a turn off. There is no simpler way to state this. Barring medical reasons

**2) ""But... what do I do with my hands?""**

First off

**3) Smirk**

You know the smirk I'm talking about. The one that makes you think, when you catch yourself in the mirror and think, ""Oh fuck yeah, I'm looking good."" Get to know that smirk well, it is now the face you will showcase to the world when you're out talking to women.

**4) Motherfucking eye contact**

Eye contact! If there is anything resembling a magic pill, nerves, and POWER. Learn to love that feeling, it's the feeling of you becoming a man who is successful with women, kiddo. Run with it.

**5) Get CLOSE to her

To quote Rob Judge, and close the gap between you and the girl until you can feel the sexual tension thicken up. This is how you demonstrate intent in your approach. 

Trust me, holding eye contact, right up closer to the girl than most guys, she will KNOW that you desire her and want to get to know her better. You can literally say anything at this point and you've made a direct approach. Congrats! Speaking of approaching...

---

**The Approach**

A quick pop quiz for you. Which of these are good openers?

* *""Hi. How's your day going?""*

* *""Excuse me. I just have to say

* *""Oh my god

* *""Hey

* *""Where you girls from?*

Trick question. They're all awesome because you're a non-needy

Master body language and you'll never have to think of a pickup line again. You can open with pretty much anything. Congrats!

But what about approach anxiety? Yes, haven't you? If you haven't, then why the fuck are you reading this? Go jerk off; I hear lonely tears make excellent lube. Otherwise, follow the Action Items in this guide and you'll be well on your way to success.

---

**Action Items**

1) Re-read the Action Items in [Part 2.](http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/11yjkw/above_the_game_part_2_fundamentals_of_attraction/) If you haven't done those items yet

2) Wherever you are, standing up straight is part of your routine. It will become something you just do, like putting on your underwear and socks.

3) Find the biggest mirror you can find. Make and HOLD eye contact with yourself for 60 seconds straight. Say silly things like, I'd fuck me.""* This is going to be a little weird, but trust me on this. You have to get comfortable holding eye contact with someone - it might as well be yourself!

4) Next, to get you fired up and smiling. Go beat that level in Mario Kart or watch some cat videos or literally ANYTHING to make you smile. Now look in the mirror and convert that smile to a smirk. If you're unsure what it looks like, take some photos and send them to me, I'll tell you. But I bet the majority of you guys will intuitively understand what I'm talking about when I say smirk. [Channel your inner Clooney.](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-avYnd-fJ2X8/UAG2IRkFQ4I/AAAAAAAAA5o/PWHo8Wmh3aM/s400/george_clooney_smirk.jpg) Practice this 15 minutes a day for a week.

5) Before steps 6 &amp; 7

6) Go to a bar or nightclub that will have a lot of women. Keep only one thing in mind - you are there to practice getting in close when you speak to women and NOTHING MORE. Approach 10 different girls or groups of girls (they can be hot, nice posture, and smirk. Say, ""Hi. What's your name?"" Hold that eye contact and get closer than you normally would. This is going to feel really weird and might creep some girls out till you get it right, but WHO CARES. You are only there to practice one thing and one thing only. Plus I bet at least a couple of them will be receptive. Get used to being in closer with the women you speak with, this is how guys get laid in bars from cold approaches. You'll need to have some experience in this area if you plan to get good with women. Do this for 5 nights.

7) Go to a busy daytime venue, a busy street corner, or a train station. Do the same thing as step 6. Try to get just closer than you used to. Try to feel the sexual tension as you look the girl in the eye. Make some small talk and maybe even ask her for her phone number. Congrats, you just had a successful daytime approach and you're only on part 3 of this guide!

8) Post at least two field reports. Tell everyone what you're doing and ask for feedback. Take it to heart and bathe in words of encouragement.",,t5_2qhrv,1374516706.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/1dd13a/above_the_game_part_3_body_language_how_to/
1350141563.0,11ezuv,"[FR] ""You can be my wingwoman!""",Trooper2442,892,193,64,"So lately I've noticed what were once called ""Field Reports"" with graphic descriptive stories meshed with tips and how to's have evolved into ""hey I fucked this girl last night"". Is the community turning naive? Not really

Ok

But for me, is the most important thing in my eyes. Last night that was exactly what I was setting out to do and I did this with one simple phrase...

""You can be my wingwoman!""

---------------------------------------------------------------------

* My roommates were at a house party and I got off work late so I decided to walk down to the main street where there are tons of bars and enjoy myself solo, doormen, servers, etc. at your favorite spots. It makes your nights much more exciting and it's demonstrating value to those around you.** If you're clueless on how to do this, one week just offer a handshake and exchange names. The week after maybe they remember you...if not I refresh myself to them by re-introducing myself (normally if I forget their name). Eventually they will remember you.

* So anyway as I walk through the door I see a ratio of about 8 hotdogs to 1 bun. It's not looking good...if you're only out for one reason. Make the most of your night, open your world and try new things...this can start somewhere as simple as beer to taking a class with everything inbetween..but for now let's just settle for the beer.

* It was delicious and I sipped it gradually while making my way to the end of the bar where I see a lonely female soul. I ask ""You aren't here by yourself are you?"" She replies with ""Oh god no that would be awful!"" That fast, 2 male friends of her's come in and start talking with her. I excused myself and moved my party elsewhere...the new spot was 7 feet away with a couple of HB 8s that strolled in, also friends with the bartenders. I use this to break the ice and find out she is 10 years older than me, obviously I don't let that slow me down. She says ""You come here often?"" then laughs at herself for sounding like a cheesy pickup line. I follow her with a couple awful ones I know of and we share  another laugh. The one that really got her was the 2nd one..I ask her to feel my shirt and ask ""Know what that's made out of? Boyfriend material."" with a small grin. She's lolercoptering all over the place and I said ""Looks like that one works!""...she actually said that was the best line she's ever heard. After 10 minutes or so of talking about the area since we just moved here, I tell her I'm heading to another bar up the street where my good friends are also bartending. I tell them to join along if they'd like and they give a positive response. I exchange numbers with the one I was chatting and make my way out.

* Halfway there I look into another bar and see my old work friend working the door. I go in and bro out with him for about 5 minutes talking about his new gig there and telling funny stories. Tell him I'll hit him up tomorrow if he's not working. I totally won't call him though. I'm such a whore. So I make my way to my destination and the girl taking covers spots me ""Hey you! Sara give him a stamp."" **I'm telling you, a HB 4, HB 2, and HB 8. I work with the HB 6, since 4 + 2 = 6. Makes sense. I introduce myself and ignore the more attractive one while dancing and kinoing the HB 4. She's actually a lot of fun and was interesting to talk to. Nothing major just school and work, boring stuff. Be careful with these subjects, **you don't want to sound like every other guy interviewing her.** ""Where do you work?"" ""Where do you go to school?"" Instead say something like, you haven't told me yet!"" Make her look a little silly

* As I dance I'm backing myself up into them with my gorgeous ass and they're eating it up. Not literally, so I pull at the only string I have to get a reaction from her. ""So your friend tells me you're a bitch..."" I was fully expecting a palm to follow the look on her face but instead she says ""Uhh what?""...the 3 of them are shoulder to shoulder staring at me. Oh damn, I messed up, what do I do now, they don't like me anymore, this  is bad, my life is oveBLAHBLAHBLAH. **Grow a pair.** I don't let that effect me

* **SO BACK TO MY TEXT:** I was supposed to meet up with a girl I met a couple weeks ago at the same place I was at. I met up with her last week

* She shows up and I take her hand,  we chest bump and I make friends with him and his buddies...turns out it's his birthday and his friends buys us all a couple rounds of shots. After exchanging numbers with him (he was a total bro) they move and in almost one fluid motion without skipping a beat, 2 girls walk up to me, HB7 and HB5. They don't say anything except lock eyes with me, I introduce myself and my wingwoman to them, I talk with the HB7 while my WW talks with the HB5. Damn she's good at this. I talk for a few, hook them up with the bartenders, make out here and there

* Eventually another female friend that's in love with me (we'll call her sara) shows up with her cute friend (we'll call her lara) whom I struck out with last time they were there. So I hug and chat with her while ignoring her friend, until it's time to pick favorites...**

* 2am rolls around and I lead my WW outside, and HB 8 are standing in line. They call out to me and I come inside and say hello, ask them how their night went. I then walk up to the counter past the line of drunks once the owner spots me ""Trooper2442, my man!"" I hug the counter girl who I'm also good friends with and turn to the owner saying ""Hey man hook them up with some slices"" as I put a 5 down on the counter. He happily hands them to me and I walk back to them bearing gifts of pizza. They light up and thank me, I tell them I'm going but not before I exchange numbers with the HB 8. **Bitches love pizza.** I turn to leave and what do ya know...sara and lara come in and spot me. I talk with them for a minute telling them I'm on my way, but not before pulling lara aside for a second and offer her a time out next week. She accepts and I grip up her number as well. What a success. I walk back home with my WW to an empty house and lead her upstairs. The rest is history.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

**So what have we learned gentlemen?**

Don't hide your interest in a girl, I showed her I'm not hung up and that I'm still living my life and being awesome. She saw what I'm capable of and it made her wet like angel dust.

1. If you don't think you are a valuable/attractive/cool/etc.. person, etc), that's one things, some girls will get passed that. But if you go out one night and you *think you look bad,*  then you're fucked. If you have emotional baggage, or shit that you dislike about yourself, fix that before you even bother starting trying to attract the opposite sex. You're going to have enough problems overcoming the fucking tidal wave of mixed signals you're going to get and manning up to kiss, girls. p.s. get to the fucking gym and /r/fitness
&gt;edit: This doesn't mean don't approach women if you're not already confident. It does mean that you should understand how important confidence is to all of this

2. If you don't touch a girl, see point 1.

3. Asking a girl the time in class is not ""approaching a woman."" If you can't strike up a conversation with a girl with a simple ""hey what's up, then you are a pussy and deserve to be alone. Having problems working up the confidence, see point 1.
&gt;edit: If you can't ask a girl the time in class

4. It's not you, and you'll never make every girl attracted to you. If you waste your time over-analyzing everything you said to some chick wondering why she didn't call/why she won't hang out with you, you're fucked. Have enough confidence to be yourself and say what you want to say. Having problems working up the confidence, see point 1. 
&gt;As an aside, say it, but say it confidently. Having problems working up the confidence, see point 1. 
&gt;
&gt;edit: This doesn't mean go do the same dumb shit over and over again. It does mean that if you weren't acting like a pussy and you can't figure out what you did wrong

5. Don't fucking lie to women. If you just fucking love poke-mans, fucking tell her. This doesn't mean you should go blurting out everything that's in your head every time you have a thought. It does mean that if your actions and dialog don't make your intentions with a girl very clear then you are definitely not a non-pussy and you should see point 1.

Everyday people post about what to do in situations. What do I say to her? What do I do after we made eye contact? What comes next?

This is NOT some sort of static game. There isn't a series of moves and an order to make them in. You are not thinking about this in the correct way.

GET YOUR INNER GAME TIGHT FIRST!

New sedditors tend to think that you can learn what to do and get women

The quality of this sub is declining imo. I see posts like ""I've made eye contact with her

Work on inner game. There are fantastic links over there-----&gt;

Read them. Seriously. 

If you think about pickup as a set of moves or tactics or techniques, but for some reason you don't think you are.

EVERYONE is good enough. EVERYONE can land hot girls, they will pick up on that via sub-communication and lose attraction to you instantly. 

Honestly

If you knew that a girl loved you and wanted to have your babies before you walked up to say hi, that means that you think there is a reason why they wouldn't love you. This means that in your eyes, you don't love you. You can't attract women from a scarcity mindset.

Okay

Example from my life:

I made a list of qualities the ideal version of me would have:

1. Solid job in Strategic Planning
1. 185 lbs
1. Well groomed all the time (i used to let beards grow etc)
1. House Always clean and smelling good
1. 8-10 outfit wardrobe (horrible with style)
1. Read/Learn something every day

Things I've done

-worked with /r/bodybuilding to design a workout/diet schedule

-enrolled in a business program at college

researched grooming/skincare products and making sure I adhere to grooming/taking care of hygiene very often

-worked with /r/malefashionadvice on where/what to buy clothing wise.

-created a reading list and schedule.



Now I am no where near complete all of these goals. But I have improved on every single one of them. I used to see women in a grocery store that I wanted to approach but didn't for whatever bullshit excuse I made up. After working on JUST me for 6-8 weeks, and this translates to increased levels of out-come independence and confidence in every situation.

1374112881.0,1ij3o5,Don't Act Abundant. Be Abundant.,FalseImprisonment,832,164,67,"** Tl;dr: in bold**

I haven't posted or lurked in this subreddit in a while, in the past half year, i've dated way more women than I ever have in my entire life.

**Story:**

Over a year and a half ago, anxiety, regret and anger. All of this took a few months to get over with. After the relationship, I immediately began reading into seddit material. I hit on many chicks, and dated a chick for a few dates, but they'd be repelled after initial attraction. **I chased women not because I wanted a partner in my life, but because I needed someone to fill a gap in life and make me happy.  Skip forward 6 months later, I've gone on dates with at least 12 women

**Reading:**

**I highly recommend Mark Manson's Models.** Definitely worth the read. I think truly implementing the advice in that book will take you a long way. Although

**Some lessons learned:**

**1) Women are people too**

It seems a bit obvious. This isn't going to be some feminist diatribe. The point is they aren't objects to be manipulated. Hell, loneliness, desire, horniness, confusion, hope, ambition etc. If you treat them like people, you'll do better in relating to them and building meaningful relationships.** A lot of guys are bitter about women

**2) Develop the lifestyle that you want to live**

You're living the life you want to lead. You are developping your career, you're getting fit, trying something new, socializing, developing friendships with guys and girls. You're constantly improving yourself and reaching for the kind of life you imagine you deserve. That said, things in the here-and-now are not that bad. You're happy where you are, but you want more.

**Look at yourself in the mirror. Would someone want to go out with you, you better change that.** You can't expect to get anything better than your female equivalent. How do you find that female equivalent?

**3) Be authentic**

Being authentic  (and hence vulnerable) will allow you to build relationships with people that you actually mesh well with.

Don't put on confidence. A lot of guys do this. It comes off as douchey, they probably haven't properly developped an appreciation for them. 

Tell people that you're angry with them

**4) Make moves**

**You need to act early and when the time is right.** Wait too long, no girl worth your time will go out with only you just without being somewhat interested in you. Make sure you escalate the kino ladder (this has been written about elsewhere, which I won't get into here). The further you go with a girl physically, the more likely she's going to believe that she actually likes you. Basically, her mental state will readjust to her actions.

I like to go caveman when I make moves. When I'm just feeling that strong sexual attraction, but that leads to awkward responses.

**Have the balls to attempt the move. If you get turned down

**5) Women are the ocean

Despite what some may say, be unsure of you, manipulate you, go hot/cold. At the end of the day, be true to yourself, know what you want and don't get too caught up in their emotional swings. **Like the sun, be the stable and enduring figure that you are. Take the high road, manipulative and needy

**6) Feeling frustrated? Take a break.**

I find that women come into my life when I've decided to stop actively pursuing them.  When I invest into myself

**7) Noone is perfect

**Everyone is flawed, recognize where to draw an acceptable limit. If a chick will cheat on her boyfriend with you, she'll do the same to you. If a chick will leave her boyfriend for you, she'll leave you for another guy. If a girl talks shit about all of her exs, she'll talk shit about you too. If all her relationships are dramatic, problematic and unsatisfying, it's likely she's the source of the problem. Find a partner worthy of sharing your life.

1343074749.0,x1819,Guide to having a hot girlfriend,weddingthrasher,868,193,211,"Having a hot girlfriend is different than having a not-so-hot girlfriend.  If you're like me, and attractive that you decide to make her your girlfriend.  This guide is about what to do AFTER you get the hot girl to agree to be your girlfriend.  I haven't seen a lot of guides on how to handle this situation

* Don't be needy.  Ever.  Even for a second.  Hot girls can sense neediness and they respond negatively to it.  This is especially true when you're in a relationship with one.  Don't beg to spend time with her, and she will respect you for that.  If she decides to travel or go out with friends without you, let her do that, and go do your own thing for a while.  If you aren't with her and you feel yourself getting needy, leave your phone at home and go do something without it for a few hours, even if it's just going for a run or going to get a beer by yourself.

* Continue to demonstrate abundance and value.  Have lots of friends that you spend time with.  Provide value in every situation.  Make memories that you can share. 

* Don't let her be your purpose.  She's there because you're a complete and centered person, passion for something besides her.  This will allow you to keep her respect.

* Other women will hit on you when you are with her.  Often, this is not them hitting on your girlfriend, *this is them hitting on you*, albeit indirectly.  Women, especially ones less attractive than your girlfriend, get insecure, and they will try to put chinks in your relationship armor.  Don't let them do this.  Deflect and ignore, it's their nature.

* Men will hit on her when you are with her.  You need to step up to this.  Most of the time, you need to step in and make some kind of move, physical or verbal, to indicate she's with you.  Be the alpha and befriend, ignore, or tool on the guy (tool on him only after you've tried the first two).  However, be on the lookout for a signal from her (especially panicky eyes that are scanning the room or looking straight at you - it looks reactive).  If you see a signal like this, I saw this happening and literally pushed another girl we were with between some dude and my girlfriend (in a playful way).  The dude backed off instantly and my girlfriend came up to me and I got a very appreciative makeout.

* A hot girlfriend will test your testicular fortitude on a frequent basis.  For me, but something borderline funny/snarky/bitchy to see how you respond.  You can do one of three things that seem to work to keep her respect and keep her knowing you are in charge and centered: a) ignore and don't respond - change the thread entirely, b) reward her in some fashion - a kiss, a squeeze of the hand, a smile.  Choice (b) may seem ridiculous and counterintuitive, but it works, I promise.  Getting rewarded for being bitchy short circuits her brain: she doesn't get a negative reaction from you (in fact it gets a positive one), so she backs off and doesn't do it again.

She can also test you by trying to get lots of things from you.  You have to draw a line in order to show you are not a pushover.  Be nice and do things for her (she's your girlfriend and you - presumably - care about and respect her), kinda far from where I live.  I straight up said no to this, but agreed that I could give them all a ride to a bar after and we could all hang out.  Nice, but not too nice.

* Show her off and be proud to be with her.  Most guys never get girls like this.  Take her out dancing, I promise.  

* You don't need to buy her stuff.  Buy a drink or two when you're out, you get the flights, she gets the hotels, etc.   Give gifts sometimes, but make them meaningful and spontaneous.  If you are a pushover and pay for everything, she will lose respect.  

* Tap. That. Ass.  Seriously, and figuring out how you can have better sex together.  Dominate sometimes and do what you like doing, but be sure to keep her satisfied.  No one ever broke up because the sex was just too good.

* Overall, a little drama doesn't hurt.  Doesn't have to be anything serious, just something where you come off looking awesome.  For example: we were grabbing the last train home the other night, she was able to get on and I, (two seconds behind her) got the door shut in my face.  I literally screamed at the conductor to let me on, and he did, I got on the train with my hands in the air like Rocky and I made out with her in front of everyone.  The entire train was cheering (this was a 1:30 train home from the bars).  Be her champion.

* If she fishes for compliments, tell her.  If she's being bratty, treat her like you would treat a bratty little sister.

* Improve yourself and encourage her to improve, a new skill to learn, a new activity to try.  

I'm sure this guide is incomplete, and she'll stay attracted to you for the duration of your relationship.

Know that the night will be good. It really doesn't matter what happens

But, like I said, your life will still be the same when you go back home, but you will feel like a loser, I think we all here know how this feels likes, and it's not good.

In every choice you do, if you choose to drink a lot or every other choice that you make. It is a risk. You're taking the risk of maybe that cute girl look at you and smile, the risk of maybe that some girl collide with you and you two start talking, the risk of you being drunk and finding a girl drunk enough to make out with you. I'm talking with my personal experience here, and I've already choose to take these risks, and all I've learned  was: Good things don't happen for those who wait. Good things happen for those who act!

""The biggest risk is not taking any risks.""

If you want to have an awesome night out

Watch this(http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlWrFgIR6CU) and this(http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MBBkMtfd7p8) some hours before going out.



**BEING AN ATTRACTIVE MALE AND SOME GAME CONCEPTS**

- Talk loud and slowly.
- Smile. (:
- Take pauses when talking. Sexual tension relys on the pauses that are made. And don't be affraid of taking pauses even when answering. Some guys thinks that you need to have instantaneous replys for everything girls say, as long as you are comfortable, the girl is comfortable too, and you will see that there is no such thing as awkward silences.
- People feel what you feel. Again: as long as you are comfortable
- Have a strong eye contact. Look people in their eyes!
- Always kino!
- Be unreactive. Don't let other people's drama(or whatever they do/say) affect you and your vibe.
- You are enough. Act like a guy who has 10 women in his house wanting him at the moment
- Be proactive. Don't wait for good things to happen to you. Make the good things happen. There is no perfect moment
- The 3 seconds rule. Look and approach!
- Talk with lots of girls! Don't focus just in the pretty ones. This helps to build momentum and there is always a good chance that some non-attractive girl is in a group of people with some attractive one.
- The triangular look. Look to the left eye
- Be the party
- Don't care about the outcome. When your purpose is only to have fun
- Don't try/Don't give a fuck. With ""don't try"" I mean

My rant starts here.  This subreddit has evolved rapidly in both members and content over the past 9 months, and the biggest of all is that inner game is confused with Natural Game and is the only thing people will collectively acknowledge is beneficial (Note, this is for the most part –I’m not trying to make a blanket statement).  


People here have different goals, and there are lots of people in between!  However, we have lost sight of what seduction is, and are now more of a general motivation and inner game subreddit.  No matter what you are looking for in a girl there is one thing that is a common truth.  Seduction has many road maps, some strategies work for some people, and some work for others!  Personally, for my first 6 months I went with a crazy strategy


**Overlying Principles**:

1) EYE CONTACT

2) Manliness - Remember ""Book of Pook"" principles

3) ""I have an abundance of women""

4) Kino Escalation and Always Be Closing

Before Going Out:  POWER POSES, TECHNO, MAP LOGISTICS (BEDROOM CLEAN, ALCOHOL AVAILABLE AND ROUTE HOME), CONDOMS.


**Interaction**:


Pre-Selection (Optional) 


**Attraction Part 1**

a) Tease w/ smile about anything that can be changed. i.e. clothes, shoes, something they are doing at the time(not body related)

I've only got a minute but... I need to get back to my friends but...


**Attraction Part 2**

a) At a dancing place - ""Do you have two legs?  Great then you can dance!"" *Go to dance floor*

b) Let me see your hand - three step twirl - *hand hold* - *move hand above her head* - *twirl*

c) Hysterical Cold Read *grab hand*

d) Me and my buddies were talking about x earlier - use indirect opinion line and open convo *EXCITING*. ""If you could have one superpower

e) Group huddle to create a bar gameplan

f) 'Birthday 9 months before must be justified

g) Roleplay GF


**First Qualifying Buffer : Question

1) You all seem friendly

2)  *Grab hand* Can you cook?  Tease ""really?"" - relieve tension.

3)  *Check out figure* ""Are you Athletic/ You work out?"" Tease - relieve tension.


**Isolate and get eyes focused solely on you where she can't look around at other people behind you.   Lead her (if not isolated from friends already move her somewhere else)**


** Rapport Part 1 - pick 2 of 5 - ALWAYS follow answer with emotion/ motive/ characteristic from previous answer.  Conversation Thread.**

a) What are you passionate about?

b) What do you like... about what?... about anything?

c) So what makes you different from everyone else in this room?

d) (I know what you) What are your ambitions

e) 3 things routine - ""try again""

b) Push/ Pull - ""I've got to run

c) I'm just going to gaze deeply in your eyes for a sec

d) Romantic comedy monologue - ha i'm just kidding you don't believe in that stuff do you!


**K-Close only if you can't f-close**

a) Use last arousal to create the right mood

b) ""I would kiss you right now if that girl that likes me wasn't looking at us... I hate to make people jealous.""


**Third Qualifying Buffer**

1) You aren't just sexy

2) You aren't just sexy


**Move to f-close**

a) Venue Change to get closer to house

b) Food

c) I've got a bottle of wine I need to get rid of.  Let's get out of here.


**Day 2 Text Game:**

""So

----------------------------------------------------------

Yep

There are so many different types of game, it's important, but it is not the only thing you need to improve at pick up.   People need an open mind when it comes to seduction.  We need to realize that some people are going to be “narcissists” and others are going to be “Nice Guys”, some people are going to want routines, and others are going to want natural game – whatever strategy works for you, but people need to be introduced to it, and right now they aren’t able to learn it!  As crazy as it sounds


Here is what I would like to propose.  To help with the inordinate amount of down votes that comments receive when someone disagrees, and taking accountability for thus vote.  


**For instance, thus creating accountability and having to explain his (or her) reasoning.**  


What this will do is open dialogue instead of having “white knights” “Red Pillers” and “PUA Newbies” downvoting without having the proper knowledge or having an extreme bias where they will downvote anything that doesn’t agree with their current worldview.  I don’t even know if this is possible


I love this subreddit.  I am not trying to sound like a cocky prick or asshole. I just don’t want to see it die.  It literally changed my life

Getting a piece of ass is relatively easy and requires almost no skill or effort. This is for men who don't know how to build/maintain attraction and bridge into LTR

The staple of the PUA ideology is that women are attracted to men who are able to elicit strong emotions in them. Point-to-fact

*""I'm this. I'm that. I have this. I have that. I'll treat you like this instead of like that. Why do you waste time with guys who act like that

And even if you manage to open her eyes to how you are a great guy, and then say something like *""You're too good for me.""* or *""Someday, you're going to make some lucky girl really happy.""* or even worse *""I don't want to ruin our friendship.""*  

**WHY?!?!?**

It's because she doesn't **FEEL** anything for you. Sure, but she doesn't **FEEL** it.

I'm a great guy. I'm smart. I'm articulate. I have a great sense of humor. I'm very outgoing and adventurous. I'm kind and compassionate, a sexy beast, and I'm amazing in bed.

And how much time do you think I spend trying to convince a woman of any of these things? 

**ABSOLUTELY ZERO!**

I'm not a fucking checklist of qualities. I'm not trying to live up to her standards. I'm not trying to prove my worth. I know I'm awesome! I'm trying to give her the opportunity to figure it out on her own. 

In the meantime... I'm trying to take off those panties with my teeth.

And here's why:

If we follow the mantra that women are attracted to men who elicit strong emotions in them, I've never had that chick-flick moment, where you see a girl and time slows down, and the lights dim, except for the halo of radiance just above her head. And when she speaks, its sounds like angels in chorus, or the strum of a harp. And she looks at me and smiles, and my heart skips a beat

It would be fucking awesome if it did... but it's never happened.

Know what happens when I see a really hot girl?  My dick twitches.  Somewhere deep inside of me; something primal and ancient

My first

Does that mean I objectify women? Does it imply that I don't respect them. Does it insist that I look at women as nothing more than sexual objects of desire.

Absolutely not. 

It means that my instincts

But what most men fail to realize is that women have the EXACT SAME REACTION to us.

When she sees you walking towards her, or if you'll get along with her mom. She's waiting for her body, her instincts to react to you. She's waiting for that urge to surface, for that itch she wants to scratch.  She's waiting to **feel** it.

And if she gave you contact information or asks you for yours

(Now, and on some level, even subconsciously, she has already resigned to sleep with you. There's just the matter of logistics to work out before the main event.)

That said, instinctive emotion and escalate: The physical, or Sexual, attraction.

If she's out with you, but it's, at the bare minimum, ""He's kinda cute. Let's see where this goes.""  What we men tend to do is start trying to appeal to her logic and display qualities we think she would find appealing in a potential mate.

We pander and pamper. We try to be perfect gentlemen and chivalrous knight. We flatter. We spoil. We emasculate ourselves trying to demonstrate why she should want us. 

And she gets bored, we become *""Her friend""*.

What we should be focusing on is making her FEEL that way about us. And since you already know she's attracted to you

*I know you like me. My job is to make you like me more. Make you desire me. Make you lust for me. And rather than list off reasons why you should like me

When I date a girl, but at the point when I feel like we're ready.

One the second date

And then I step back and let her come to me. This shows me she's just as interested and willing to make the effort to get us there.

By the third date

*(Now

The point is to let her know you're interested. That you crave her, but physically and emotionally.  Make her **feel** for you.

Now

*""But what's wrong with taking your time and really getting to know a girl instead of focusing on the physical?""*

Honestly

See, they aren't producing any type of feelings or emotions in the woman. She calls you when she's board, she texts you to see how you're doing, she goes out with you when she hasn't already made plans, she tells you about the creep that hit on her at the gym, and she starts to see the sweet, funny, who's a really great **FRIEND**.

But the guy that gets her hot... the guy she finds herself thinking about when she should be studying or working... the guy she's frustrated with because he won't return her calls... the guy she had that erotic dream about... the guy that kissed her and made her feel like her panties were ablaze... THAT GUY!! That's the guy she cancels plans to spend time with. That's the guy she wants. That's the guy she desires. The guy who makes her FEEL strong emotions.

And now that those emotions are there

And when all that ""clicks"" in her head and she realizes what a great catch you are

The bottomline is to focus less on trying to tell her, the fastest way to a woman's heart, is in the bed.

**The Night** I went over to one of my friends houses and was hanging out there when one of them mentions that there is a party nearby. I am immediately excited to go

**The Party** I arrived at the party, I am 3 beers in, and I have 2 more in my coat and a full flask of rum. I'm also super excited about the party, because this is the first party I have been to since I started on my path to seduction. Needless to say, I am not simply bringing my A game, I'm delivering it next day air with full shipping insurance. 

The moment I step in the room, and kinoing every person I touch within 10 seconds of meeting them. I flirt with EVERY girl at the party. Anyone above a 5 is fair game. There are a bunch of little premade christmas present ribbons, the kind with tape on the bottom, on the table in one room. I was flirting with an HB6, and after using the [shoulder spin](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEitVCksdzk), she laughs and sticks one to my chest. Bam, now I have a fun way to kino girls. I love the shoulder spin from the How To Kino series because it isolates, and is funny. I place the ribbons on girls either when I'm opening or exiting

**The Approach** after about 45 minutes of hugging people I recognize, you are on fire tonight, what is up with you!?""), a girl catches my eye. HB8, long wavy red hair, big doe eyes, cute face. Can't tell her body to well because of a huge ugly sweater she is wearing (Damn Portland fashion!). She's in a 4 set with some of the girls I talked to earlier, and I turn to her, I completely own it and laugh about it. I actually almost get everyone's name right

**The Seduction** Once it's just her and I, I lightly placed my fingers on her cheek (didn't use my whole hand by placing the palm, just used my fingers), and turned her head back to me, saying [""I'm much more interesting than whatever is over there, honey](http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/vqbvw/fr_the_rubix_cube_of_fcloses/). OOOOOOOOH BOY did her eyes light up. It was mostly surprise, but there was a definite spark of attraction. Her body language completely shifted after that. She still wasn't initiating any kino, when I decided that I should go for it. I turned to her and said ""Alright, but as I was moving in

**The Celebration** I immediately went outside and jumped like a lunatic. I felt like a GOD. Then I immediately realized that I had completely forgot her name. I spend the next 20 minutes ""nonchalantly"" wandering around the house in a desperate bid to find her. I found her above the garage, where a few people were playing the weirdest drinking game I have ever seen. The floor was **covered** in nails, and there was a stump in the middle of the garage. I can tell she is nervous, but completely vibrating with excitement. Within 30 seconds the garage is empty save for the two of us, and I grab her and start making out with her. On the floor. That is covered in nails.  

**The Number &amp; Ride Home** So after 15 minutes of this I realized I really need her name, and say [""You know what to do.""](http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/10mve2/fr_class_game_number_close/) She is confused and asks me what I mean, but I don't answer and simply spank her. She gives me her number, and I look at my phone and thank god she put her name in too. While we are making out, she says ""I'm surprised that I'm doing this. I thought I was going to hook up with a girl tonight."" Apparently, she is bisexual and wasn't looking for a guy at the party. We keep making out and discuss going back to my place, but I didn't push it hard enough and instead, but we certainly had fun. By 1:45, she finds her friends, I drop her off and tell her I'll see her soon


**Aftermath &amp; Highlights**

* We are confirmed friends with benefits
* I used the present ribbons as a novel way to initiate kino. Use your surroundings and be able to improvise. 
* Make yourself the party
* Seeking permission for flirting will get you nowhere.
* Learn to read body language! It is possibly the most important part of communicating. If I hadn't been able to read her
* Don't save your seduction skills for one person. Seduce the room or the whole set and you will be successful.
* By seducing and charming one person can validate you to anyone they know. (This could be phrased so much better
* Don't worry about whether or not you are ""in state."" If you are

1374439951.0,1irp11,[FEMALE PERSPECTIVE] Three examples of approaches I have experienced: what worked and what didn't work.,-all-that-glitters,866,219,176,"So I’m a long-time lurker with a vagina and friends of the vagina-bearing persuasion and I thought I’d give an (as it turns out alarmingly extensive) breakdown of a few approaches we’ve been on the receiving end of in the past few weeks. For reference









**Approach  1**




I was alone, he **maintained eye contact despite the loud club environment** (i.e. didn't just talk into my ear) and let his hand drop from my shoulder, to my arm, to around my waist. This guy was running textbook game, but I didn't care. If a girl knows you're gaming her and she's attracted to you (i.e. your game is working), she gives but not one fuck.


After a few more seconds of talking to him, so it might not be wise to rush the kiss this fast as a rule. I think that, certainly in club game, **this kind of timeframe is acceptable (and even desirable) as long as the girl is showing a reasonable level of interest** (and by sticking around, smiling and remaining engaged, I was giving all the IOIs), but this guy was probably used to having to build a little more comfort before going for the close.


ANYWAY. Later on throughout the night


After a bit of this he bounded over to my group and initiated some solid kino by playfully hip bumping me into one of my girl friends. My friends gave me the 'wtf is this guy' look and I reassured them that I knew him and that we'd gotten familiar earlier. This guy now has **massive social proof** both within my group, and went in for the insta-makeout. He was clearly practicing some serious abundance mentality: 'she doesn't want me, DGAF, NEXT'. The problem was, I did want him, I was just having fun and didn't want to bounce right that second. Had he danced with the group a little more, waited for a slightly lamer song to come on, I would have gone with him without hesitation. As it was




**Approach 2**



So my friend and I were standing just off the dancefloor when we were approached by HG5. He was clearly targeting my girl (I choose to reassure myself that this is because he was short and I am 6', but I know that once he was in set he ran some pretty good game. Despite clearly being interested in my friend (let's call her A), he made sure to **interact with the two of us fairly equally**, which helped me feel comfortable and prevented a 'standing there awkwardly while he hit on her' situation. This worked in his favour too, because girls are often very sensitive to the feelings of the group, and had A sensed my discomfort she would have been unlikely to engage with him for long. I don't remember a lot of the conversation, but here are some things he did well:


1. This guy was **peacocking like a motherfucker**, interesting print shirt, nose ring, and geek glasses.


2. When asked, because a lot of girls will think you're a knob.


3. At one point, we seem to have lost someone. Is she always like this?' which simultaneously **banded him and A together** ('we' VS 'she') and called me out on my rude behaviour.


4. So my friend A is a bit of a pictures freak and so obviously insisted she get a photo in HG5's glasses. 


* First off
* Second, which I thought was a pretty good one because it's fun, but the girls who are particularly conscious of how they look can still pull a sexy pouty face and call it anger. Something HG5 didn't do here but could have was give the anger a justification (e.g. an 'our first fight' roleplay).
* By this point HG5 had probably built enough comfort to go for the 'sexual tension shot' (a smouldering look into each other's eyes which can build actual sexual tension if done right) or at least a kiss on the cheek picture.


At this point I decided to eject to give the two a little privacy. I later found out that A would have happily gone for the number/k-close by the end of the interaction




**Approach 3**




Ridiculously high energy group of guys on the dancefloor, some truly fabulous dance moves. In terms of the actual approach, one guy grabbed an empty bottle from a table and started an impromptu spin the bottle with the surrounding sets (including us). When the bottle landed on me, the initiator took one look at my embarrassed (but not entirely unreceptive) expression, and planted a massively sloppy kiss on and around my mouth which was clearly intended to disgust. The fact that he **went against every expectation I had** and didn't actually use this excuse to go in for the makeout made me a lot more attracted to him. Of course, it may have been the case that these guys genuinely were just out for a good time and I'm reading way too much into it. But, intentional or not


..so this turned out to be a lot longer than I was expecting. But anyway. I hope you guys find the girl’s perspective at least interesting

There's a dominant idea in this community that naturals are oblivious to what they're doing – that they just go around and pick up girls by their nature alone. Although this is true for some

For example, have no financial skills, and no reliable emotional control.

Who wants this? Not me. 

My Israeli friend is the only natural I've ever met who’s never studied any seduction material, and can explain it – something very few ""naturals"" are capable of.

I've learned a HUGE amount just from hanging out with him

So without further ado...

**Idea #1: Posture

We all have an idea of what ""peacocking"" is from Mystery... weird hats

Funnily enough, naturally.

Humans are no exception to this rule. We have all the tools for attraction and ""peacocking"" built into us, or external objects.

So where does it come from? **Posture.** Your posture is a direct 1:1 manifestation of how you feel internally. If you're depressed and shy, you’ll have little-to-no muscle tension, and TALL posture.

When you are in this confident state and are receptive to finding a good looking girl

By walking with tall posture (literally

But they don't do it through touching you or talking to you. No, shyly looking down when you hold eye contact, etc. If you have fantastic posture and stand with absolute confidence in yourself, you become a magnet for these ""first moves"". Therefore, the game changes from ""I'm going to try and seduce a girl"" to finding the girls who are already “making moves” on you, and talking to them.

Realize that when you first stand up tall, which is why very few people truly stand with fantastic posture. It's not easy!

But now that you're aware of this

Think about it... regardless of how you look

After learning this from my friend, you will NEVER walk around with slouched posture again.

Even though I'm much smaller than my Israeli friend

**Idea #2: Minimal Texting**

If you've ever lost a girl due to poor texting

But after grasping this idea

When we first get a girl's number

You know how it feels... you send a text and you feel like shit: ""was that the right thing to say?"" Then we beat ourselves up

This is fucking madness and it’s all unnecessary. In fact

If a girl is into you, and increase the odds that you say something that turns her off.

If a girl isn't into you

I remember I was working next to my Israeli friend, I don't text girls when I'm working – only when I can meet up with them.""

That's right. He only texts a girl if he has the ability to meet up with them. This makes texting incredibly simple. Is your night free? Send her a text.

Now, or over to your place, or whatever it is you choose.

If she says yes

• If she says NO with an excuse (""I'm busy, what about tomorrow evening?""), she's most likely not interested in you. Either text her in a week's time and try again or delete her number.


• If she texts NO but suggests another time to meetup

This will save you TONS of time... both in exchanging messages back and forth
In my early days, never making anything happen with them! This way, you make things happen very quickly, or they were never going to happen in the first place.

View texting as a logistical tool – nothing more!

**Idea #3: Want a Girl Who's Working? Ask for the Number IMMEDIATELY**

We all have fantasies of picking up that cute waitress

It's true – girls are in ""work mode""

But there is a way to break this ""work mode""... you come out right upfront and say what you're interested in. Picture this, she says ""Hello, how are you"", you say ""What's your number?""

She's shocked, and can now proceed with the intent to get her number before you end the interaction with her.

Obviously this doesn't guarantee you a number of a girl working. It's still not easy. However

I've always wanted to be able to pick up girls who are working. But I always did it wrong. I would go to a place a hot chick worked, planning on ""getting her number later"". Months would go by, I'd finally ask her, and be horribly rejected.

However

Now

You have to be professional. If it clearly isn't going to work, if it's not working (and you'll be able to feel it), simply go about your business at the bank, and say ""have a nice day"" without thinking about it.

This is definitely not easy to do
If the thought of instantly asking for a number bothers you

**Closing Thoughts**

These three ideas have totally changed my life. When talking to my friend, to a dude who can get numbers, meet up with girls, and seal the deal consistently.

He doesn't have much time, he’ll answer your question. It's for education, and from what I know, it's an outside of the box way to get money straight to teachers who give a damn.

If you have a sticking point that's been holding you back, he can definitely help you out – he's done it with me countless times.

Hey guys. I want to thank you all for your feedback &amp; support over the past years. This is a very personal post

About a year ago I had a vision. I was fed up with the state of seduction material. The pickup business has morphed into an endless stream of fluffy blog posts, and podcasts. It was no longer about the content. It was about inundating you with messages to get you to sign up for $3000 bootcamps.

I hated the fact that we didn't have a modern

**""ABOVE THE GAME"" KICKSTARTER CAMPAIGN**

The [*Above The Game*](http://redd.it/11ng7n) guide you see in the sidebar is just the tip of the iceberg. Reddit is great for a lot of things

**So today I am pre-announcing a Kickstarter campaign to publish a full-length *Above The Game* book.** It will be both a physical and e-book. I will make certain that the various funding tiers will offer substantial value to all backers. I hope to go live in the next 1-2 weeks. I will be raising $2000.

This will be the first book *by seddit - for seddit.*

---

**HOW TO STAY UPDATED ON THIS PROJECT**

reddit is not the ideal medium for project updates. I also don't want to spam seddit. To alleviate this problem

I'm going to take the Louis CK approach and only update you when I have something really important to say. 

To receive updates via email

**FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS:**

**1) Why Kickstarter? Why not just start a seduction company?**

I'm using Kickstarter because it's the easiest way to run this project with the community in mind. I have no desire to become a full-time pickup instructor. I believe the bootcamp business model is flawed. If I took that route

**2) Why are you stepping down as moderator?**

Seddit is the largest unaffiliated seduction forum on the internet. We are very proud of the fact that we are not affiliated with any companies. We prefer to remain unbiased and pure. Even though I'm just publishing a book and not starting a full-fledged business

**3) Does the book contain new material?**

The book will be full of new

**4) Fuck you. I'm not giving you a dime.**

That's not a question

None of this would be possible without the amazing seddit community. As such

**5) Why should we back the campaign then?**

Back the campaign for any of the following reasons:

* You want the best-organized and highest quality version of the material.
* You want access to all the *Above The Game* material before anyone else.
* You want a hard copy.
* You want to read it on your device of choice (Ipad
* You want to support a homegrown seddit project.
* You want to help legitimize seddit with a proper published book.
* You want to give a copy to a friend.
* You want your name/username listed in the book (this will be one of many gifts).
* You want to say thank you for my posts over the years.
* You want to encourage me to publish again in the future.

**6) Shut up and take my money.**

Basically, I will text her saying ""If I was giving out grades on your call back skills, you would definitely get an F!""

I kid you not, the girl will text back with something. If she texts back with some excuse, I will then respond by saying ""Terrible excuse, but at least you are trying. For that, I will raise your grade to an F+"" This then usually gets into stuff about extra credit and how she can raise her grade.

EDIT: To help squash any doubts

Me- Hey! If I was giving grades on your call back skills

Her- Haha that is fair. Hopefully that isn't the final grade!

Me- Well

Her- Hmmm not even a full letter grade... What did you have in mind for this extra credit?

ANOTHER EXAMPLE

Me- If I had to give you a grade for your calling back abilities... I'm afraid I would give you an F!

Her- Haha i'm sorry my life is crazy! I was totally gonna text you today but you beat me to it!

Me- Haha yes of course. Typical excuse. It's ok

Her- Haha can I get any extra credit??

HERE IS ONE THAT DIDN'T WORK OUT

Me- If I was giving grades on your call back skills

Her- I just ended a 3 year relationship last month. It was/still is rough. Sorry dude... just need me time.

ANOTHER EXAMPLE

Me- If I was giving grades on your call back skills

Her- Haha sorry!!!! Things have been pretty crazy... I had 3 online exams and a glogster project due yesterday. I slept until 2pm today because of my lack of sleep all weekend.

Me- A glogster project? Tiffany, I will raise your grade to an F+

Anyway

EDIT 2- I also just tried another variant with great success. I said ""Bad news X

Her- Oh shit! I forgot! Hahaha! You would make a school joke [I work at a college]. I'm going out of town tomorrow and between work and pre-trip errands

Me- Jess, let's say we raise your grad to a frowny face plus.

Her- Can I earn some extra credit!? Haha

Me- Yeah... probably. But if you slack on it

Her- I do kind of like to be in trouble though...

ANOTHER EXAMPLE

Her- Lol!! I'm sorry!! Work was crazy busy the last couple of days and I have been exhausted. I was definitely slacking a bit ;P

Me- Pshhh typical excuse lol! But for your efforts I will see if I can get your grade to a frowny face plus.

-- The overreaching message of this community is great. Go out, be interesting, become the best version of yourself, give no fucks. The top posts, the ones of with the most upvotes, they get that right. It's not so much their techniques as the way they frame their life. I'd go out on a limb and say their/that attitude is more beneficial to them in attracting women than their actual techniques

-- There are a ton of different styles (obviously) and they're not all going to work for you. Peacocking, your best bet is to try different styles and see what feels natural and gets you the most success. 

-- STOP READING SEDDIT IF YOU'RE A HIGHSCHOOLER. Again, you're fine. You'll have plenty of time for sarging/gaming in college and later on.

-- When you're reading a FR that involves a lot of success (an F close, can go VERY WRONG if you don't know what you're doing (in the example of kinoing, it can come off as creepy, and once a girl thinks you're creepy it's hard coming back.) I'm not saying not to do it, I'm saying that understand that if you're a total n00b there will (probably) be failure involved. Work up to it.

-- That being said, you gotta start somewhere!) ask instead if they know where [important public transit stop, landmark in your town that everyone knows] is. 

-- Don't feel like sarging/gaming? I'm not saying you need to game every night, but the more attractive you are, the easier it gets. 

-- Ever heard of the book (yep, seems unresponsive, SHE'S NOT INTO YOU. This is especially true because (next point)...

-- Girls lead guys on all of the time. For fun

-- If there's one thing that I can't preach enough, if there's a cute girl in your class, don't just get her number and ask her to study or for coffee multiple times. Hang out with her 1 on 1 and then invite her to a party or a bar or whatever. Guys wait too long to be proactive and end up friendzoning themselves. 

-- This might contradict what I just said, but realize that asking a girl you barely know about her sexual life can cross boundaries. Yes, make it clear you're not looking to be friends but that doesn't mean you need ask the craziest place she's had sex. 

-- If a girl tells you she has a boyfriend

-- The term oneitis is misleading. It's normal to like one person, unsuccessful behavior with her. That's why it's not working out. Pursue her but don't drop everything else for her. 

-- Negging. For the love of God, but what you fail to account for is a girls self esteem. The hottest girls aren't necessarily the most confident. Even if the girl has THE BEST LEGS YOU'VE EVER SEEN, don't make a neg about them because you have no idea how she feels about them. You really need a special frame, girl, situation and personality to pull it off. Unless you're getting laid left and right, don't neg a girl. Being cocky (can be) good, being a total asshole is not. Which is how most negs come across IRL. But if you're going to do it, or that feature that you're negging is a 9 or 10 feature.  (edit: I seriously debated putting this one in because it's such a firestorm. i'm not saying negging doesn't work

When a guy is in a terrible relationship with a girl, or treats him disrespectfully.

The problem is that these things don’t usually happen out of the blue. It’s not like she was treating him amazingly well one day

**Right from the beginning

Perhaps he texted her and she didn’t return his text. So he texted her again. Begrudgingly

His first mistake was to keep pursuing when she wasn’t giving him enough back. When you do that

As you get better with women

Guys inexperienced with women tend to put MORE effort in when a girl isn’t giving him enough. This makes things even worse.

I recently had a girl cancel a date on me 30 minutes before the date.

“So sorry I can’t make it!” she texted me. “Let’s schedule something for next week if you’re still up for it.”

“Sure! No problem

What he should be doing is upping the ante. Even if he did get a date with the girl in this situation

Instead of texting her back right away, “It depends, are you going to wear a skirt or jeans?”

**Be willing to walk away if you aren’t getting enough respect or interest.**

You walk up to a woman and say “Hey”. She smiles and says “Hi”. And then what do you do? Well you need to keep a conversation going! Because if you are not talking to her in a smooth and controlled manner

In this post I will show you a conversation technique which will help you keep a conversation going for as long as you want. If you can master this simple technique, and start talking. I will also show you how you should approach conversation with women, because after all, a woman’s thought processes are completely different from a man’s.



So what exactly is a ‘conversation’ and what does it mean for men and women?
A conversation is a way for people to exchange ideas and thoughts with each other. Everyone involved gets to put their input and learn more about the other. Conversation also comes in a variety of forms. We can exchange information on our feelings, problems…and just about anything else. So what is the goal of conversation?

When men talk together, use conversation to bond. That’s why you’ll see women on the phone with each other for literally hours. They’ll keep swapping stories and talking about what seems to us as pointless things. Therefore, for women, conversation itself is the goal.

An example might make this distinction clearer:

If Grant just breaks up with his girlfriend and tells his friends

On the flipside

You have to understand that women constantly relate with each other and share similar stories. That’s just how they communicate. That’s why you often hear a woman saying “I like him a lot

For women the goal of conversation is conversation itself

But what happens when an average man walks up to an average woman and starts talking? Well he shares his story first and she shares her story

For example:

Woman: “We spent a whole week at the Caribbean beaches. It was great but we all got sunburnt!”

Man: “Wow that’s pretty bad

What the man said here may have been OK if he was talking to another guy

Man: “Tell me about

Now, let me tell you that it is much easier than you could have imagined.


I was bored of searching for stock images of couples having conversations
Threading-the simplest and most effective conversation technique
I am sure that you have seen someone knit before? Knitting involves taking a thread of yarn and weaving it into another thread. And you keep doing this back and forth until one or two threads turns into a hat or a muffler. By using a simple technique you can create something bigger and more beautiful than the original threads. The same goes for conversation.

When you’re talking to a woman, hopefully she will look back on your conversation as a powerful and attractive thing you shared with her. Conversation, like knitting, consists of easy and simple components woven together to create something more amazing.

When you think of a conversation like this

Woman: “I love going to the Paris. It’s so romantic”

You: “Paris is my favourite city. I love the laid-back nature of the people”

Or

You: “Yeah as soon as you arrive in the city you can feel the romantic energy”

Or

You: “What is it about Paris that you especially love?”

Or

You: “What do you think makes Paris so romantic?”

I came up with these sentences in literally a few seconds. How? It’s quite easy- let’s look at the woman’s sentence one more time.

Woman: “I love going to the Paris. It’s so romantic”

In this sentence

1. I love…

2. Paris

3. so romantic

So you can talk about:

1. Things you love

2. Paris

3. How you find Paris/other places romantic

You can do this everytime she speaks, relate and then wait for her to reply. And so on. If you can master this skill it will increase your confidence when it comes to approaching women, because you know how to start and fuel a conversation. If you come across a woman in a shopping mall and she says “I’m just shopping around for some jeans with my friends”, you know that you can thread off to talk about:

1. Shopping (“There’s this store on the second floor you’ll love…”)

2. Jeans (“I hope you’re not one of those who goes for ripped jeans”)

3. Her friends (“Your friends seem like a great group of girls. How do you know each other?”)

Can you see how easy it can become with some practice? You can take any of the above responses and use them to keep the conversation going.

And remember this technique only helps you to find WHAT to talk to her about; it helps you direct the conversation where you want to go. You also need to watch HOW you talk to her. While you’re having an intriguing and long conversation

Ultimately
…women are looking for intriguing and exciting men over big, keep practicing the threading technique. It doesn’t matter who you do it with first, just get good at it. If you can master the art of threading, women can feel as you’re one of the only men they can connect with. And if you mix in some intrigue and teasing, only good things can happen",,False,t5_2qhrv,True

I have NEVER had that rate, I now realize that going for the kiss is always the smart decision (if she's flirting with me and if I'm unsure if she's single, I ask her what her boyfriend thinks of something or whatever, if she replies that she doesn't have a boyfriend I interrupt her and kiss her as she's saying it).

*I've also been employing this new method of starting a make out. I mention that my wingman is my boyfriend or that my boyfriend is getting drinks

The moral of the story: Flirting for nothing other than fun (and to get comfortable flirting) can lead to unexpected things. Most of the time it's just a confidence booster (even if she says no, it's a win in your books), but once in a while, as in this case, you can get some pretty interesting results.

Fast forward 11 days and she's naked on her bed in front of me.  And god damn is she sexy!!

Let me explain a little bit.  I've always felt like the ugly guy, I decided to start giving a shit about me.

I dumped 90% of my band shirts.  I started finding clothes that fit me.  I began to hit the gym and tell myself how good I looked every morning.  I started going out every weekend with a buddy, but damn I was out there dancing!  At the time, I didn't care if I got women or not, I was having too much fun just being myself - and people noticed.

I started speaking to women.  It was daunting at first, my personality, but MAINLY my attitude towards myself.

All year I've been doing this and it was beginning to get frustrating because I had never gotten anywhere but talking but then the confidence boost came.  I began to actually BELIEVE myself when looking in the mirror and telling myself how attractive I had become.  How fun of a person I was and how no one could turn me down.  I started walking into the bar like I owned the place and speaking to girls like they were my best friend before we even said a word.  It is unbelievable what believing in yourself can do.

Ok, WOWWWW"".  Major confidence booster right there.  We went to another bar for ladies night and I decided I'd sober cab.  They both had a good amount of drinks and were both dancing on me at the bar and I took them home and dropped them off.

A few days later (Dec 8th) my buddy and I picked up the girl that ""isn't attracted to me"" and went to the bars again.  She got pretty drunk while I stayed sober (sober cabbing again) and she made it very apparent that the previous statement about not liking me was not very true anymore.  She was grinding on me like crazy and staring into my eyes.  Eye contact worked VERY well with her as she looked like I was driving her crazy every time we locked eyes.  I dropped my buddy off and then her and I went back to her place where she passed out on one of her two couches.  Dammiiiiiitt!!! lol

Alright, and then her stomach and then her inner thigh...and then before you know it my hand is in her pants.  We had a little fun and then realized how late it was.  It was 1:30 AM and I had work in the morning.  I said that I should probably go and then I heard those magical words.  ""Yeah, you could go, or you could come to my room"".  As you can imagine, I was a zombie at work the next day.

I guess the thing I want to stress is that you cannot give up.  Giving up is the ONLY surefire way that something like this will not happen to you.  I am not saying that this is going to work on every girl because it probably won't

1354884771.0,14fwmb,Intro to Pick up,redzky,731,156,82,"Intro to picking up girls

I believe that thinking in terms of 'as simple as possible' is always key when it comes to being efficient and learning something as quickly as possible. Being successful with women can be seen as a complicated task but it's not. 

I think what is important in order to avoid getting discouraged is to focus on an outline of terms and ideologies.

One of these is that pick up is a numbers game:

Yes, nerdy, scrawny, isolated, non-socialized, average Joe can get action as long as he is able to go out, make those approaches

It's really not rocket science. 

Becoming a pick up artist:

Now this is a controversial term that is always getting beaten down into the dirt. People have a very stigmatic view of what this is and see it as maybe trashy while other may view it as glamorous. My view is that there is nothing wrong with learning how to become better at attracting a mate. I think anyone that thinks that maybe this is creepy or odd has a lot of insecurities of their own that they are afraid to deal with.

The only thing that separates pick up artists from anyone else is the fact that they chose to embrace the numbers game and facilitate ways to increase their percentage of success through trial and error.

Good learning Approach(Day-Game): 

Day-Game: Meeting and picking up women outside of bars and clubs(Specifically during day time)

When getting into the game you might want to start out with Day-Game. The reason I think this is a good idea is because 1) it helps you get used to going up to women you don't know and 2) you will see that It's much easier to meet women during the day.

Quick Day-Game Lowdown: 

All you need to do is go up to a girl who is stationary or even walking toward you on the sidewalk of a busy street and say
When she says yes, what is your number?""

I suggest that you only set up a meeting with the girls who choose to text you back the most. Also make sure that you meet up as soon as possible.

The Abundance mentality:

One thing you will learn is that many women will flake. This is just part of the game. The average percentage of success starting out is around 5%. 

This means that you will have a sexual interaction with 5% of the women whose numbers you manage to get. So if you get 50 numbers then you will most likely do something sexual with 2-3 of them. 

As you get more experience then you will gradually notice the success rate start to elevate as well as your confidence.
So get used to this and make sure you never get too invested in one single girl.

Logistics:

In the beginning the best way to get some action with a date is to meet them as close to your place as possible. You never know when you will hit the jackpot and find a willing girl who is content with a steamy night of passion.

Setting up a meeting point that is an efficient distance from where you wish to get some action is known as setting up the logistics. 

When starting out I suggest you keep the logistics relatively efficient. 
As you get better then you can play around meeting further away or even going to the girl's place.

However I prefer to bring it home simply because I feel more comfortable in my own bed and can enjoy a better night sleep after the interaction.

Looks:

looks are a very debatable issue. Many say that looks matter but I don't believe they are completely necessary. 

Through my experience I've realized that most women will find even the most simple characteristics

However it is still important to stay moderately groomed and hygienic.

Neediness:

Another thing that is important to avoid is coming off too needy. However there is a fine line between confident and arrogant(cocky). Cocky in moderation can be stimulating but in excess it will quickly cause a girl to lose interest.

In order to avoid being needy you need think before you act. Ask yourself

Through my experience I have learned that what tends to keep a woman attracted is your ability to be independent. Don't be afraid to ask a girl to get the next round, don't stop dating other girls, even if you get along with her, don't be afraid to lose her, don't be sensitive about what she thinks, don't need her, don't need her

Conversation:

In time you will feel more confident in your speech. Yet to start out with you should pay attention to a few minor details to keep from reaching a dead-end. 

-Demeanor

Try to speak from your throat as opposed to your mouth. This will evoke a more manly and mature sounding voice.

-Speed of speech

Try not to speak too quickly. A nice moderate speed that gives you enough time to think will be sufficient enough.

- Ask questions

Ask her what kind of guys she likes

- Stay positive

Avoid negative topics; stay away from traumatizing events, gossip. Need I say more?

- Make statements

Tell her what she reminds you of

- Take breaks

Don't be afraid to go to the restroom, don't be afraid to turn and observe the room or bar where you're at. 

- Games

I have found that playing darts or pool can be a great way to bond with a woman. It's a good way to playfully tease them when they miss a shot and gradually get them to come out of their shell through laughter and joking. You don't even have to be good.
Women will be just as impressed with your ability to have fun as they would if you were an excellent pool player.

Signs of interest:

Things that you need to look out for are whether a girl is genuinely into you. The way it works from the start

Some signs of interest are:

- Her touching you

If a girl's interested then she will look for excuses to touch you

- Big eyes

Another thing is something I like to call anime eyes. Her eyes will be big and shining and looking straight back into yours.

- Laughing at your jokes

This is obvious

- Easy to hold her hand

This is key

- Easy to hug

Most girls

Also if she is ok with this then you might as well go in for a kiss.

- Her asking you personal questions

If a girl wants to know more about you then she is curious about you

- Qualifying herself

This is when you tell her something about yourself and she says something about how she enjoys that too or that she always wanted to do something like that.
She is basically letting you know that you are good enough for her.

- her complimenting you on your looks

This is an obvious one. If she is telling you this then you might as well kiss her because she's game.

- Easy to kiss

Although


Escalating to a sexual interaction:

Although lots of girls will generally allow you a sexual interaction if they agree to come back to your place some may not. Don't try too hard to convince them if they don't want too. 

I think the best thing you can do is run some basic tests and if this doesn't work then just tell them you need to go somewhere and send them on their way. If she texts you another time then she will most likely be up for going further next time. Make sure to meet her at the same spot and just walk back to your place directly.

Tests for escalating to sexual interaction:


1) While making out with her


2) If she won't let you take her pants off then at least try to get her to finish you off with her hand while making out with her. If she does then she will most likely text you another time and proceed further. 


3) If she won't finish you off with her hand then ask her if she can give you a massage. If she says yes then take off your shirt and have her massage you. If you work out then this might get her turned on. 

After 30 seconds turn around and repeat ""number 1"". It's possible that after the massage she may be turned on enough to proceed further


*If she is resistant to all these then just forget about her. I don't bother with a girl if I am not getting all the way on the first interaction. I used too before but now I don't think it's necessary. 

You can get action from another girl just as beautiful or even more beautiful. No reason to bother with the one playing hard to get. 

-Don't be afraid to lose the girl. A well-known Pick up artist who goes by the alias Mystery said a great thing that you should never forget;

""You must be willing to lose the girl before you can get the girl.""

If a girl really likes you enough then there shouldn't be any resistance. That's what it all comes down too. Only give to those who want to give back.*

So that covers the introduction. Feel free to send me any questions or thoughts. All the best.

I'm on Seddit to work on my confidence and social skills.  That'll probably help me get girls as well

It has always been counterintuitive to me to introduce myself to strangers if I don't have a specific reason or goal.  Seddit says ""Talk to everyone"" though

Among the many seemingly irrelevant people I talked to (i.e. they are not interviewing me, I introduced myself and was able to keep the simple, shallow conversation going long enough for her to... get excited and tell me about the office and show me some cute party invitations she was making.  And she started telling me about her life.  For the record, she's 20+ years older than me.  HBimjustnotinterested.

I talked to low-level folks

An aside: the head-of-department mentioned, and probably new since I started reading Seddit and Dale Carnegie.

Anyway, to wait for one more interviewer.  While we were waiting there at reception for a couple minutes, I started chatting with the receptionist again.  She was happy to see me, and showed me her progress on the invitations.  The head-of-department looked at me like ""what planet are you from"" so I just turned to her and said, pointing back and forth between me and the receptionist, ""We're friends now.""

That was a show of confidence and a huge DHV.  It also would have been impossible if I didn't TALK TO EVERYONE.

1336523820.0,tdur1,[FR] Hilarious situation at a nude beach turns into a threesome,secks_is_fun,702,132,121,"So I'm hanging out at the nude section of the beach in Barcelona.  Just chilling, CBD sits down about 5 feet away from the HB's and just stares creepily.  Naturally

This is when I have my moment of brilliance.  Without directly addressing the HB's or CBD, and again I follow him and sit between him and the HB's.  At this point the girls are laughing pretty hard, and we have become the center of attention for this section of the beach. After another minute or so of staring at my dick, CBD decided to give up and go search for greener pastures.

So there I am, they ask where I'm from and I tell them I'm from the US.  Well it doesn't take long for the conversation to turn sexual because the next thing one girl (we'll call her HB1) says is:
""If you are from US
""Wow
""Haha noooooooo
""Hey

We continued with the playful banter for a while (I'm mainly talking to HB1 since HB2's English wasn't as good, but I would like to hear your opinions on this as well) and because I didn't want to choose between the two options that were right in front of me, I said that I prefer a giant pubic afro, and it makes me sad that not many women sport that look anymore.  Luckily this made them laugh and we moved on.

By the way, so I decided to answer honestly and see how they react.

""I'm looking at those guys so that I don't get a boner.""
""Hahahahaha we don't care if you have boner
Hoooooooly shit, and me no longer trying to prevent it, my cock started to grow.  And as soon as it started growing, they both started staring at it, which of course just made it grow faster.  Well, pretty soon I've got a raging boner and the HB's are staring at it and giggling.

My second moment of brilliance: ""So...do you guys want this for here, you want to come to our flat?  It is very close."" HOLY FUCK, my cheesy line actually worked!?! Trying to contain my excitement a bit, I replied ""Sure, we can do that.  I don't have any other plans."" So we stayed at the beach for another 20-30 minutes or so, most of which I spent flipped over so I could hide my boner, which of course the HB's found hilarious. But eventually we packed up our stuff and started heading to their place.

Man, which was great news for me since at this point I was only going to try to bang HB1. So I ask HB1 which room is hers, and she leads me in there and I close the door.  We instantly start making out and ripping each other's clothes off. I've already seen her naked so there is absolutely no LMR as I undress her. I'm in.

A few minutes later I'm going down on HB1 and HB2 comes out of the bathroom and into HB1's room (both bedrooms were connected to the one bathroom). FUCK! Cockblocked, and then HB2 TOOK OFF HER TOWEL AND WALKED OVER AND LAID DOWN ON THE BED NEXT TO HB1! I'm not a religious man, but I swear to god I heard fucking church bells at that moment!  So instead of just f-closing HB1, a fucking threesome had just fallen into my lap!  Hallelujah!

1371491417.0,1gj117,Why Men Have the Power During an Approach,bl1y,724,154,132,"Who has the power during the approach? The woman, keep it shut

At least, but I’m going to put forth the case for men holding the power in approaches. But first, you need to be familiar with two concepts from negotiation theory, the Ultimatum Game and BATNA.

Fair warning: This post is long, maybe that explains your continued virginity.

**Ultimatum Game**

The Ultimatum Game is a classic experiment in negotiation theory and behavioral economics. In it, and E is left with only two options, to accept or reject the offer. No other communication is allowed, he can’t say what terms he will accept ahead of time, and cannot make a counter offer. If E accepts, the money is split as offered. If E rejects, neither side gets anything and they both walk away empty handed.

A purely rational E should accept any offer that O makes, but E’s options are $1 if he accepts, and $0 if he rejects, and $1 is more than $0, so it’s in his interest to accept.

But that’s not what happens. If the offer is too low, and want to punish O, and he will therefor reject the offer. $1 is a cheap price to pay to keep your dignity and to teach O not to be such a greedy bastard.

Without communicating, and most people in E’s position will accept down to about $20 or $25. O wants to hedge a little bit, and is likely to offer something around $60/$40 or $65/$35.

What’s this got to do with approaching? As the man, deciding if she wants that pleasure or not. Further on in the interaction things will be a lot more complex, and there are plenty more chances to reject, but at the very first line, the true opening, her only options are to allow the conversation to continue, or immediately reject you.

It seems like she has all the power, or at worst ties the Offeree. The Offeree has some power, but the fact that the Offeror typically comes out ahead (usually getting $20-40 more) means that the Offeror is in the stronger bargaining position.

This translates nicely into social dynamics quite well. She has the power to reject an approach

**The Pie’s All Wrong!**

In the Ultimatum Game, she has hers, and you’re offering to swap. You have 70 to offer, she has 85, you make the offer, and there’s an 85/70 split in your favor. Why would she accept that? Because, just like the in the Ultimatum Game, even if unfair

So then why do so many 3s and 4s get consistently blown out, it’s a total package assessment, or at least as much of the total package as can be assessed form an opener.)

What we’ve learned from the ultimatum game is that your opener will be accepted if (1) she sees the interaction as an improvement on her evening, and she’ll blow up the offer just to get back at you.

And now I think the Ultimatum Game has been done enough, and not even the only ones in the venue.

**Best Alternative to Negotiated Agreement (BATNA)**

I hate the acronym, not the best alternative since the best option isn’t necessarily guaranteed.) Just think of your BATNA as your fallback option if you get rejected. If it’s a typical bar crawling Friday night, your next best option is to approach another woman in that venue, or venue change and find someone in the new place. So, your BATNA is pretty much just the exact same thing, minus 5-15 minutes of lost time. That’s one heckuva fallback position. Just imagine trying to negotiate a raise with your boss — and imagine than your BATNA is an offer at another company across the street with the same salary you’re earning now. Not too shabby.

Now consider her BATNA. If she rejects you, maybe no other guys will approach her at all. Because most women don’t have the social toolbox to make an approach, she’s left in a very precarious position. She’s not guaranteed a second attempt with someone else the same way you are.

You don’t need a PhD in Behavioral Economics to see that the person with the better alternative is in the more powerful position. To you a rejection comes with minimal cost, the fact that you can go elsewhere and she cannot, really puts you in the stronger position.

In certain venues, she’s the tall blonde turbogirl, and you’re not particularly attractive. In that case she’s better off rejecting you because the alternative is that she’ll likely be approached by a more attractive guy.

In smaller venues though, don’t insult her, and be more interesting and attractive than the prospect of spending the rest of the evening alone.

**The Take Away**

Approach Anxiety is, if not the single biggest, and it affects everyone from AFCs to experienced guys.

Understanding the actual power dynamics in an approach though can help you to overcome that anxiety. You’re not entirely at the girl’s mercy

1349013835.0,10pkqj,20 Life-changing things I learned from Robert Glover's book 'No More Mr. Nice Guy'  ,TeaStainsAndTobacco,693,136,138,"First

A typical Nice Guy is someone who:

* Puts others' needs above his
* Tries to be perfect and hide his flaws
* Is not respected and gets taken advantage of
* Is afraid to take risks and challenge himself 
* Is uncomfortable expressing what they really feel or think

One of the most interesting parts of this book was Glover's talk about 'childhood abandonment experiences'. Most Nice Guys had a distant father-figure in their childhood. Children naturally become distressed at not having their emotional needs met, it can cripple your professional, social, and romantic relationships. Humans are naturally selfish to some degree, so it is incredibly unhealthy if you approach relationships with an expectation that putting others first will earn you love or affection.   

All in all, empowered, and goes after what they want. 

1.	Develop integrity; be honest and truthful in all interactions
2.	Don’t be afraid of the world or trying new things
3.	Learn to surrender yourself and let go of what you can’t change
4.	Do what YOU want to do instead of trying to constantly please others 
5.	Learn how to receive and ask for help without feeling guilty or uncomfortable
6.	Recognize that you and everyone else is human
7.	Stop trying to be perfect and flawless
8.	Stop seeking approval and external validation
9.	Learn to approve of yourself
10.	Stop building walls that prevent others from getting too close
11.	Stop trying to cover-up or distract attention from any perceived shortcoming
12.	Reflect on the childhood events and conditions that influence how you act today
13.	Set boundaries to prevent people from disrespecting or taking advantage of you
14.	Learn to be clear
15.	Spend more time around men in order to develop your masculine energy
16.	Recognize that women reject nice guys because they perceive them as weak
17.	Learn to be more passionate, and responsible
18.	Stop putting pressure on yourself to do everything ‘right’
19.	Don’t let fear of failure or fear of success stop you from living the life you’ve imagined
20.	Make a conscious decision to make your own rules and not settle for mediocrity

1307584235.0,hv570,NEWBIES READ THIS -- Comprehensive Guide to Game,Bobsutan,678,118,66,"There seems to be a lot of newbies to the community posting these days so I'm going to give you guys the comprehensive overview/primer I wish I had when I started out (thank you Nutz)...  


**BUILDING MERE EXPOSURE**
 
Opening, repeat the sequence of steps, and have success nearly every time. Soft skills are more like an art where you learn the structure, practice it, and every time you finish you'll have a slightly different outcome. Think painting a picture. Some will be better than others, some will be complete shit, and others will be a work of art. That is a soft skill. Anyway, hooking, and all the other aspects of “game” and attraction comes into play. More on that later. For now I just want to cover the sequencing I spoke of a moment ago:

 

1. Mere Exposure
2. Opening Lines
3. Trigger a smile
4. Approach
5. Qualifying Statements
6. Disqualifying Others
7. Ask an Opinion
8. Lock In!


One of the most important rules of indirect game is to never make it feel or seem like you're hitting on them. The two main things that give away your intentions is poor delivery and shoddy body language. If you're delivery is off at best you'll look like you're hitting on her, bullshitting as some call it, and not actually an attempted pickup. So many guys telegraph way too much interest and their intent is clear as day. So how do you hit on them without hitting on them?

Pre-open. When you first hit the venue do what is known as pre-opening. This is when you do a brief approach, out, and gone. This really trips them up because you're actually walking up to them, talking to them (only guys that hit on them do this, right?), but then you leave! That can't be right? If you're hitting on them why did you just walk off? You know what they're thinking, “Hmm... maybe he's not actually hitting on me after all.” If they automatically assume you're hitting on them, especially during night game, and Observational (aka Situational) openers:

 

* Functional openers are the easiest and most socially acceptable openers to use. However, “Do you know where the bathrooms are? I can't find them anywhere and my friend is about to make a mess!” and so on.
 
* Compliment openers are just as they sound. You give a compliment, “That's a great dress. I like how it makes you stand out from the crowd.”

* Observational openers are just as they sound. You're commenting on the environment around you and are the most powerful as it creates a commonality and are spontaneous. As I mentioned above you don't want to give the impression of hitting on them, but just conversing with someone else nearby about that cool or strange widget you just noticed. An example would be “&lt;wing&gt; check that out! Look at that picture and this one over here. (Said to the woman...) Do you see that? They're all the same pictures, they're just different color! I wonder how many people even notice that? Weird, huh?”


There are three main rules when doing a pre-opener:

   1.  Justify why you're talking to them. Those familiar with Neil Strauss' style of game would call this “rooting the opener”. Same idea really. If you look at the example's I gave for each opener they all have a justifying statement included.
   2.  Always exchange names and do a handshake if able.
   3. Tell them it was nice meeting them and/or to have a good day/night


Once you've done 15-20 minutes of pre-opening in the venue your mere exposure effect should be climbing. And I do want to say that pre-opening is not the same as warm-up sets. While warm-up sets can raise your mere exposure effect, now it's time to start approaching earlier women you pre-opened. Scan the venue for women you've talked to and use non-verbal communication to get them to smile. I've found almost 100% of the women I've pre-opened will smile when doing this. Congratulations, when they smile at you they've just given you an approach invitation! Yes fellas, it's that simple. What do you do when they give you that approach invitation? It's simple... you lock eye contact, keep smiling, and go straight in.

I see a lot of posts and questions asked on here about ""coming off as an asshole"" or ""being a pig"" and I think a lot of people don't understand the difference between being shameless and being an asshole.

I'm not going to really hit on the ""just fucking do it"" aspect because everyone here says it

Once you just start approaching you'll start to love the rush you get. Sometimes the rush I get from just approaching new girls is better than taking her back to my place for the night.

I had an approach last week that turned out to be pretty successful. I was in our university cafeteria and  was waiting in line. A HB7 walked up behind me and I thought, made eye contact and pointed to the silverware rack, chuckled and said, ""Lots of spoons, ehh?"" She looked a little puzzled, smiled and said, ""Oh yeah, isn't it?"" and conversation just went from there. I got her number and she came and partied with us this past weekend. I wasn't worried about getting laid


Guys, cheesy one liner or some pick up line, I literally just said the first thing that came to my mind. Girls aren't aliens. They're fucking people! Just approach girls naturally, being yourself and everything will just go as planned.


But back to the part about being shameless. I feel that being shameless means to do things you want

*""What if she thinks I'm weird?""*
*""What if she thinks I'm ugly?""*

What if you quit being a loser and just approach and let her come up with her own opinion of you instead of the unrealistic

When you approach girls, or really what she thinks for that matter. If you approach a girl and she immediately blows you off that's her loss. You're life is awesome. You're awesome! You're being different and approaching girls like a man, being straight forward and real. You're not using cheesy pick up lines, you're being chivalrous. If a girl doesn't want to be part of your awesome life, who cares? That's her loss!

I approached a girl yesterday with, but you are absolutely gorgeous and I'd love to take you out for coffee sometime."" She responded with the more uninterested, unenthusiastic, ""..Thhhannkkss...."". I followed up with, ""Are you always this nice to guys who go out of their way to compliment you?"" and she actually laughed and we talked for a bit. I got her number, but don't plan on setting anything up cause she was a real bitch. 

Most guys wouldn't have come back with a somewhat mean response like I did. I was shameless. I guarantee she didn't expect that response. I didn't care though, ""Well, someones a bitch."" and walked away. Instead I responded with a question and one that initiated a response.


Things to remember/learn when approaching:


1. Be shameless - Go out and just have fun. Don't hold yourself back because of what others will think. Do things because you know they're only going to better you. Rejection betters you. You actually build up a shameless attitude about it. I don't even care if I get rejected anymore because I know there's so many more girls waiting to be approached and half the other guys out there are too scared or worried to approach them.

2. Let the nerves be fuel to your fire. I love the rush I get from approaching. It's almost addicting. I approached two girls yesterday

3. Realize the feeling of ""what if"" is worse than the feeling of rejection. Nothing sucks worse than going home and saying ""I what what would of happened if..."". At least if you get rejected you know you tried. I always remember this when I'm feeling some AA.

4. Remember that you're unique. You're different. You're awesome. Girls aren't used to a direct approach. Be you. Let girls see you're an awesome guy and you're not like the rest.

I can't stress this enough and I can't stress how many times I've accidentally done this and completely reversed otherwise failed/friendzoned approaches/relationships.   **This is the #1 most powerful tool anyone in this community can give you if you understand the implications.**   If you've never been in a serious relationship before then this might not be that helpful.  

-There's no anxiety to approach

-There's no need to info/data-gather/mine.   Who cares?  Assume you know this shit already.   

-You feel more comfortable; she feels more comfortable.

-Silence is fine.  

-She feels like you can be her boyfriend; or better than her current boyfriend.  

-You lose your outcome dependence.  You stop trying to impress, it's just ""you"" having fun.

Here comes a ramble...

I went through a phase of thinking I couldn't talk to girls because I wasn't a 6'2 beautiful rugby player. Having seen guys much less attractive than me get with girls, take up space, talk loudly etc. but I still couldn't just say 'Hi' because I just had no idea how to fake confidence.

Last night I figured it out, then saying something clever and going through the steps to sex without being shot down along the way. You don't see a girl and think 'what should I say?' you see a crowd of 20 girls and just say hello to all of them.

This sounds intimidating. Saying hello is difficult. You will feel all sorts of anxieties and you'll worry about what they'll think. But realize that if you just say 'hello' or something similar at least half of the girls will shrug you off and won't be interested. This is fine. This will happen whoever you are and whatever opener you use.

But the girls who don't shrug you off will be delighted that a guy came and said hello to them. They've been stood there waiting for a guy to smile and say hello to them, hoping you don't think she's boring, hoping you don't think she's weird. Anxiety is human. It's normal.

I'm going off topic here.

Let's say you smile and say hi to 20 girls in a college bar. Here's what happens:

10 of them will politely say hi back but won't really be interested. The conversation will be slow and awkward and you'll parts ways very quickly. She'll think you were nice but for one of many many reasons she just wasn't interested.

2 of them will get an ego boost from shooting you down. They are attractive and they know it and it gives them pleasure to say no to dozens of guys. Fuck them.

The other 8 are delighted you came and said hi and will try and push the conversation along just as you are. They will be trying not to embarrass themselves

If you are Brad Pitt then this 10-2-8 ratio turns to 2-1-17

If you are wearing an ill fitting T-shirt and old jeans or you have weird unkempt hair or you say hi but mumble it while staring at the floor then this ratio turns to 17-2-1

So try this:

**Find out your ratio.**

That's it. That's the goal. The goal is not to get a number or a dance or a kiss or a fuck. Not even to get a conversation. Your goal next time you find yourself in the corner clutching your beer is to go and say hi to 20 girls with the sole intention of seeing what happens

You don't actually care whether or not they like you. You realize that about half the girls will politely say no and that won't embarrass you

You will probably fail this task.

Well before you get to 20 girls you'll have met someone cute who laughed at your silly comment and got on well with you. You'll never find out the ratio because you won't leave this fun interaction for the sake of completing a task. The point is to start with the mindset that you a approaching a girl to find out about her

Right, you'll naturally be more confident and talkative and your anxiety will just melt away. You aren't approaching a girl to try and pull her. You are approaching a girl purely for the sake of it...

One more time:

The key to all this is not 'confidence' it is Outcome Independence.

**Edit:** When I say 'say hi to a girl' I don't mean literally say hi and stand there. What I mean is just make a very simple opener. Could be as simple as a smile, ask how she knows the host, ask how her night has been, mention that it's crowded in here, say *anything* just keep it simple.

First a little background. 18 years old, but I was completely smashed. It eventually got to the point where I couldn't even speak. Needless to say I don't remember shit, but I was without a doubt a fucking mess. Regardless, I texted her the next day asking to meet up at the beach. For reasons unbeknownst to me, she agreed. (seriously, even I would've flaked on myself after that performance)

Once at the beach, and throwing out genuine compliments.

The result of doing this was astounding. We actually formed an incredible connection. And it sounds cliche but it really did fill that emptiness that I'd felt in my previous hookups. After our little date

I should also note that when we began hooking up on the beach, she texts me out of nowhere (completely irrelevant to the conversation): ""I want to have sex with you"".

I met up with her last night and we had a sick fucking time. She told me she's never had a guy treat her that way. 

That really resonated with a book I just finished reading, other girls tell him that a one night stand with him meant more than entire relationships. This is EXACTLY how it felt with this girl.

### Premise 
The word [seduction](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seduce) has two meanings either **""to lead astray""**  or **""to attract.""** It is up to the individual to choose what he wants to do with the information given.

The seduction community was establish because there's a need for men to have a dialog. 

What men usually have among his close friends is typical of this dialog:  
Guy 1: My relationship is not going great... any advice?  
Guy 2: That's too bad

The dating advice that are traditionally given to men in this modern age does not typically work. The community is a peer group of men that talks about what works, handling situations, how to handle relationships, dating, sex, confidence issues, rejection

People who read seddit can range from people who's just looking for single girl that he could have amazing relationships with, divorced, depressed, no father figure, etc) or did not not have many women around them to interact with (long term relationships, lives in rural area, etc). Therefore

1367197083.0,1db1fl,Billy's Guide to Learning Pickup,bl1y,697,175,93,"The first thing a newbie needs to understand about learning pickup is that it is a process. You’re going to build up a core of skills

A lot of guys come in with the idea that they’re just going to learn a trick or two or a strategy to get this one girl that they’ve been going after, you’re not going to hit the ball. You probably won’t even swing until it’s in the catcher’s glove. And even if you did get a piece of it, if the ball isn’t immediately caught, you’re not going to be fast enough to round the bases.

Back in the old days we had the saying that to get one girl, you really need to learn how to be generally attractive, and how to attract just about anyone.

**Focus on Process**

Easiest way to get discouraged is to go out, and then slink back into some dark corner and vow never to approach another girl again. You got a bad result, and that deflated you. The problem is you focused on the result. I’m not going to say to not care about the results, because that’s a pretty superhuman bit of psychology there. It’s hard to control what you care about, but you do control what you focus on.

Focus on the process. If you’re intimidated by clubs or the thought of going out solo, success really is determined just by putting forth an effort. Doesn’t matter if you get any hits, what counts is that you’re showing up to the batting cage and swinging at every pitch.

Even as you get more experienced

**What the Process Looks Like**

A lot of guys will hit plateaus. You’ll go out, be able to open consistently, and then you’ll find you’re just not getting any better. The problem is that your process probably sucks.

When you go out to the bars and clubs, but often two or three. It’s only after you’re warmed up that you start to make progress. Try going to the gym, stretching, and then going home. See how much stronger you get.

When you stick it out for hours, you force yourself to open or else spend the next 4 hours bored out of your mind. There’s some nice motivation.

It’s also best to go out more than one night a week, and that will allow you to progress much more than you could have if you waited a week between outings. Plus, you’re not getting any younger.

**Be Patient**

This shit takes time. You’ll have some periods of rapid progress, learns at a different rate, and has different goals. Stick with it, and approach learning pickup with the expectation that at best it will take about 6 months to really be decent, but that you should expect it to be closed to 2 years. Sounds like a lot of time, but compare it to how long it takes to get decent with a musical instrument, or to speak a foreign language. And, it’s not years of drudgery. You’re going to have a lot of fun along the way. And by fun

**Take Care of Your Shit**

Get a job, learn to dress (and smell) like someone girls want to have sex with.

This really cannot be stressed enough. The more you improve the rest of your life, maybe 10 pounds. It works both ways. You’ll feel better, project a better energy, your clothes will fit better, and you won’t have to quit having sex after two minutes because you’re not used to doing pushups. Also, drink a lot more water. 2-3 liters per day. Not only will you feel better, you’ll lose fat quicker

There’s too much to say about fashion for this post, and actually take a few moments to consider how you look.

You also need to keep your home presentable. Every time you go out

Finally for this part, I volunteer with a non-profit, I listen to Fresh Air, Wait Wait Don’t Tell Me and A Prairie Home Companion, and I cook a lot and like to learn about food and cooking. Pick whatever hobbies you want, but try to have something that is either hands-on or creative. It’s easier to attract girls when you’re an interesting person, plus you’re going to be much more relaxed and less needy when you have other sources of enjoyment in your life. Likewise, playing video games

A lot of guys have shit lives and are hoping they can find a girl who makes everything great. You won’t find that girl. She doesn’t exist. And

**How to Ask for Advice**

You’ll hit lots of stumbling blocks along the way, they ask unanswerable questions, and they lose sight of the process. Let’s go through these one at a time, starting with the second, then the third, then the first.

Unanswerable questions. “Why didn’t this girl call me back?” No one knows. We didn’t see your interaction, and while experienced guys can offer some likely explanations, no one will ever be certain.

Asking about specific interactions like that is stupid because, when you need to be focusing on how to improve your stance and swinging motion. Think about your interactions in groups. Are you hitting the same problem over and over again? That’s what you should be asking about. Not how to solve one specific interaction that went poorly, but how to react to similar situations in the future so that you improve your odds. You’re not trying to hit that 1 ball 100% of the time. You’re trying to hit 50% of the next 10 pitches instead of 20%.

Lastly (but originally firstly), actually I do. I just don’t want you to submit it. Without the details, obviously no one can really give you good advice. But you’ll find that when you start filling in the details you’ll discover what went wrong. Once you know the basics, you’ll be able to think your way through these things. Take the time to do that. If you need to, write out a description of what happened, being as detailed as possible. You’ll almost certainly discover what the problem was. That’s incredibly powerful. There is nothing better for learning pickup than being able to answer your own questions, and when you’ve trained yourself to analyze your own interactions, and you’ll get faster. You’ll get so experienced with it that you’ll be able to see what’s going on in real time, then you’re just never going to get better. A big part of the game is learning how to think about your interactions

If you can’t figure out what went wrong despite looking at it from every angle

**Your Excuses Suck**

You can’t find time. You don’t drink (you don’t have to

Let's break that down. *""Expressing your sexuality""* means you are clear with your intent. You are speaking to her because you find it fun and you think she is attractive. A direct statement of interest certainly accomplishes this

*Non-needy manner* should be familiar at this point. You are speaking with her because you *wonder what she is like.* Does she fit your qualifications in a girl? Go find out! That's being non-needy. You're not hard up for sex

Flirting done correctly will cause her to *""become more attracted to you.""* That's the name of the game.

There are two basic forms of flirting: *breaking rapport* and *leading.* Breaking rapport is anything that shows you are willing to risk rejection. Leading is when you

Any time you tease, or act dismissive, you are breaking rapport.

*Examples of Breaking Rapport:*

* **Push/Pull** (Giving a reward then taking away
* **Vocal Inflection** (Lowering your inflection as opposed to raising your inflection at the end of sentences. It's the difference between *""Wow
* **""Reality Destroyers""** (Something incredibly spontaneous and unexpected to the point where her brain short-circuits a little. Examples: *picking a girl up in the air for no reason,"" [Angel/Goddess Technique](http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/fdji6/fr_new_pickup_strategy_discovered_angelgoddess/)*)
* **Physical Push/Pull** (Push/Pull with physical twist added. [Example here.](http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/f6ve5/fr_tofutofus_physical_pushpull_as_an_opener_short/))

Leading is when you

*Examples of Leading:*

* **Touch** (You are physically leading the interaction forward)
* **Roleplaying** (You are deciding to play a game and allowing her to play with you.)
* **Changing venues** (You decide where to go next.)
* **Making decisions** (You decide what to order
* **Treating her like an old friend** (You are deciding to treat her like an old friend even though you just met.)

As a general rule of thumb,** will allow you to maximize your attractiveness and pass any ""tests"" she may throw your way. Keep that in mind.

**Touch**

Touch

Because it's so important, offer handshakes and high fives to people like they're going out of style.

When you or the person you're talking to says something funny

Decide arbitrarily to move to another section of the bar, put your hand on the small of her back. *""Come on, let's move over there.""* or *""Let's go check the other side of the bar out. Come on.""*

Try to hold hands

---

**Conversation**

Your conversation skills are important but not the be all, comedians and storytellers who rely almost exclusively on their words to get laid. But here's their big secret: they turn most women off rather quickly.

They speak when they should listen. They're entertaining when they should be seducing. They are building up to a punchline when they should be building comfort. In other words

As a man

Do not be afraid to call out a conversation as boring and change the topic. That's *leading* and that's flirting 101. Here is an example:

&gt; You: How were your classes today?

&gt; Girl: Not bad. 

&gt; You: Cool. Any plans for the summer?

&gt; Girl: Not yet... *looks away

&gt; You (*recognizing the situation*): You know

&gt; Girl: What?

&gt; You: Yeah

&gt; Girl: LOL what? Uh...

&gt; You: Seriously

&gt; Girl: You know a lot about Japanese porn

&gt; You: Yeah

&gt; Girl: LOL

&gt; You: Hah bet you never thought you'd be discussing my middle school masturbation habits

&gt; Girl: Hah can't say I did.

&gt; You: Anyway

I chose this example because I'm a guy who wants girls who are comfortable laughing about topics like porn. I spent time reflecting on the qualities I like in a girl (As listed in the section on Qualifying Women in Part 4) and want to make sure any girl I speak to is okay with that. I also quickly turned a boring conversation to a hilarious and sexual one with just a few words. **""This conversation is boring. Let's talk about something more exciting."" &lt;-- your new best friend.**

That's being spontaneous, you're trying to find out *what she's like.* Don't be afraid to scare incompatible women off. That's a GOOD thing.

---

**Comfort Building**

Just remember, talking about porn is great, but you'll need more than that to find a girlfriend. Entire books have been written on comfort building methods, but I'm going to share my secret with you.

In addition to finding common things you like or have experienced (commonalities)

1) A time when you were really embarrassed

2) A time when you were really scared

3) Your relationship with your parents &amp; your parents' relationship

It has been scientifically proven (by [Dr. Arthur Aron](http://aron.socialpsychology.org/)) that those three conversation topics lead to high levels of comfort between individuals. You will each feel like you have shared a very vulnerable side and you will have more respect for one another because of it.

---

**Action Items**

(NOTE: Don't worry about rejection. You're just practicing different things, some will take a couple years. The important thing is to NOT GIVE UP. The rest of your life depends on it!)

1) Go out to a high-traffic venue that you are comfortable in. Approach 10 different girls or groups of people

2) Try to get them engaged in a conversation. You can stick to something situational (sports news, wait for a moment of laughter or delight and touch them lightly on the forearm.

3) Make a conscious effort to try both *breaking rapport* and *leading* forms of flirting with them. Tease, are you cheating on me? Shit, are we gonna have to get divorced? Oh man I better call my lawyer."" trollface*) Practice lots of different things and figure out a style that works for you. This may take a while but it's a lot of fun while you're trying things out.

4) When you find girls who are receptive to your flirting, I want to get to know you better. Let's sit at the bar.""* works wonders here. If you can't get her alone, try to get her phone number and set up a date so you can talk then.

5) Make an active effort to use the comfort building items listed above. Get experience doing these with at least 5 different girls.

6) Write field reports for all of these interactions and take the community feedback to heart.",,t5_2qhrv,1368733838.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/1di9xu/above_the_game_part_5_flirting_touch_conversation/

Hi guys. So seddit has topped 15

To celebrate this milestone

**FEATURE #1: Locally based sedditor lairs**

With over 15, we feel it's time to facilitate more real world meet-ups. We will be launching with Los Angeles and Tokyo as the pilot lairs, with the hope that others will grow organically. If you would like to establish a lair for your area, please see if there are any interested people in your local community and contact the seddit moderators for further details.

The idea was presented to us by sedditor withClass to establish a Los Angeles based sub-seddit. You can find it at [/r/LosAngelesSeddit/](http://www.reddit.com/r/LosAngelesSeddit/). 

The Tokyo lair will be located at [/r/TokyoSeddit/](http://www.reddit.com/r/TokyoSeddit/). 

For now

These semi-private communities will allow for easy management of logistics for meetups and discussions. All field reports and strategy developing in these lairs will be posted into the main seddit

All those interested in joining the Tokyo lair, please contact [withClass](http://www.reddit.com/user/withClass/).

**FEATURE #2: ""IAMA mPUA"" Interview Series**

Yes

There's a whole body of knowledge and experience these masters of seduction can share with us, so please be cordial and give them a shot!)

Our first guest has been confirmed as [Savoy](http://www.lovesystems.com/team-bios/savoy) from [Love Systems](http://www.lovesystems.com/). We will allow approximately one week for questions to be up/downvoted and the top ten questions will be sent to each mPUA. In addition they will return for a live IAMA session approximately one week after the initial thread goes up.

I hope you guys are excited for this as we are! More details to follow soon once we confirm the dates with the mPUAs.

If any of you have connections to mPUAs who might be interested in doing an IAMA

We hope to have this as a regular feature on seddit

This is an important topic that I believe is a sticking point for many of you guys. I'm here to share a simple hack that you can do to help you qualify women

If you can convey that you are interested in her physically early on

Direct game is one way of doing this. You guys probably have heard this before.

Example: *""Hi

But I want to show you a simple hack that you can work into your approach

I have two versions I use that work well.

**Version 1: ""You're My Type""**

This one is simple. Just mention off the cuff that one of the girls you're talking to is your type. I like, with strong eye context. Touch the small of her back if you can. Make sure she sees you're not just saying it randomly, but that you actually mean it. Afterwards, continue with your conversation like normal. 

**Version 2: Physical Compliment**

After you've opened, do not do this as the opener unless you plan to run direct game and know what you're doing.**)

I like to hold her hand for a bit during the introduction handshake

You can say anything that conveys that you find her physically hot. ""Your eyes are absolutely stunning."" or I even have been using ""It has to be said

Honestly

I know this seems redundant because YOU already know you have sexual intent

There it is. Simple as pie. Convey sexual intent no more than a few minutes into your approach and watch your friendzone/flake rate drop dramatically.

But some of the PUA techniques are ridiculous

We will never be pretty enough. We will never be skinny enough, or sag too much. We are what is left over after all the supermodels and movie stars are taken. Seriously. 

Also

So you have all of this going against you when you approach a girl. Even if she is smoking hot and has great boobs and perfect ass

Okay, who probably has self-esteem issues anyway, in order to make her lower her self-esteem some more? You don't need to do that. Don't do that. Just be honest and if she looks good, tell her so. Then, if she acts like a bitch, tell her she *was* hot until she opened her mouth. 

And don't use any of the underhanded ""tricks"" to get a girl to feel like she should sleep with you. If a girl puts her trust in you because you seem ""different"" or because you acted like you wanted more than just a one night stand in order to get laid

On the same token, to know that you were anything less than honest with any girl about your intentions. You just wanna fuck for one night and then never talk to her again? Don't act like you'll call her, and make it okay for both of you to be fine with this. I would have been much more likely to go home with a guy who was like ""Hey, you and I could have fun tonight with no strings attached."" than a guy who was like ""I think I love you.""

Just something to keep in mind. I know it isn't easy for you guys

One more thing: Most girls know about the PUA stuff, sometimes lack of confidence can be even more endearing than you think, as long as you are genuine.)

1343136061.0,x2ktn,Letting Go of Attachment -- From A to Zen,MrStinky,617,101,66,"“Most of our troubles are due to our passionate desire for and attachment to things that we misapprehend as enduring entities.” ~Dalai Lama

If there’s one thing we all have in common it’s that we want to feel happy; and on the other side of that coin

We pin our happiness to people, a break up, a transfer.

We attach to feelings as if they define us, it can seem safe and even comforting to suffer.

In trying to hold on to what’s familiar

When you stop trying to grasp, you give it the freedom to fulfill you without the power to destroy you. That’s why letting go is so important: letting go is letting happiness in.

It’s no simple undertaking to let go of attachment—not a one-time decision, moment-to-moment commitment that involves changing the way you experience and interact with everything you instinctively want to grasp.

The best approach is to start simple


**Experiencing Without Attachment**


Accept the moment for what it is. Don’t try to turn it into yesterday; that moment’s gone. Don’t plot about how you can make the moment last forever. Just seep into the moment and enjoy it because it will eventually pass. Nothing is permanent. Fighting that reality will only cause you pain.

Believe now is enough. It’s true—tomorrow may not look the same as today

Call yourself out. Learn what it looks like to grasp at people, controlling, manipulating, or losing something instead of simply experiencing it.

Define yourself in fluid terms. We are all constantly evolving and growing. Define yourself in terms that can withstand change. Defining yourself by possessions, but also who you are.

Enjoy now fully. No matter how much time you have in an experience or with someone you love


**Letting Go of Attachment to People**



Friend yourself. It will be harder to let people go when necessary if you depend on them for your sense of worth. Believe you’re worthy whether someone else tells you or not. This way

Go it alone sometimes. Take time to foster your own interests

Hold lightly. This one isn’t just about releasing attachments—it’s also about maintaining healthy relationships. Contrary to romantic notions, you’ll both be suffocated.

Interact with lots of people. If you limit yourself to one or two relationships they will seem like your lifelines. Everyone needs people

Justify less. I can’t let him go—I’ll be miserable without him. I’d die if I lost her—she’s all that I have. These thoughts reinforce beliefs that are not fact


**Letting Go of Attachment to the Past**



Know you can’t change the past. Even if you think about over and over again. Even if you punish yourself. Even if you refuse to accept it. It’s done. The only way to relieve your pain about what happened is to give yourself relief. No one and nothing else can create peace in your head for you.

Love instead of fearing. When you hold onto the past

Make now count. Instead of thinking of what you did or didn’t do

Narrate calmly. How we experience the world is largely a result of how we internalize it. Instead of telling yourself dramatic stories about the past—how hurt you were or how hard it was—challenge your emotions and focus on lessons learned.  That’s all you really need from yesterday.

Open your mind. We often cling to things, situations and people may affect you the same. The only way to find out is to let go of what’s come and gone.


**Letting Go of Attachment to Outcomes**



Practice letting things be. That doesn’t mean you can’t actively work to create a different tomorrow. It just means you make peace with the moment as it is

Question your attachment. If you’re attached to a specific outcome—a dream job

Release the need to know. Life entails uncertainty

Serve your purpose now. You don’t need to have x-amount of money in the bank to live a meaningful life right now. Figure out what matters to you

Teach others. It’s human nature to hope for things in the future. Even the most enlightened people fall into the habit from time to time. Remind yourself to stay open to possibilities by sharing the idea with other people. Blog about it. Talk about it. Tweet about it. Opening up helps keep you open.


**Letting Go of Attachment to Feelings**



Understand that pain is unavoidable. No matter how well you do everything on this list, pain is inevitable, suffering is optional.

Vocalize your feelings. Feel them, and then let them naturally transform. Even if you want to dwell in anger, sadness or frustration—especially if you feel like dwelling—save yourself the pain and commit to working through them.

Write it down. Then toss it out. You won’t always have the opportunity to express your feelings to the people who inspired them. That doesn’t mean you need to swallow them. Write in a journal. Write a letter and burn it. Anything that helps you let go.

Xie Xie. It means thank you in Chinese. Fully embrace your happy moments—love with abandon; be so passionate it’s contagious. If a darker moment follows

Yield to peace. The ultimate desire is to feel happy and peaceful. Even if you think you want to stay angry

Zen your now. Experience, and let go to welcome another experience.

It won’t always be easy. Sometimes you’ll feel compelled to attach yourself physically and mentally to people and ideas—as if it gives you some sense of control or security. You may even strongly believe you’ll be happy if you struggle to hold onto what you have. That’s OK. It’s human nature.

Just know you have the power to choose from moment to moment how you experience things you enjoy: with a sense of ownership, or with a sense of freedom, peace and love.

The most important question: what do you choose right now?

So this post is an oldie but goodie... I was reading through my notes the other day and I noticed I sometimes reference the Three Second Rule but I have never written a proper post about it. So without further ado...

**THE THREE SECOND RULE**

This was promoted back in the 1990s on the usenet group alt.seduction.fast. I am sure it has origins before that. It was popularized by Neil Strauss in his novel *The Game.*

**The rule is simple: When you see an attractive woman

While I don't agree with the Three Second Rule as a hard and steady rule with no exceptions

It is especially useful for people who are just starting out practicing game. **It works because it's so simple.**

---

**Committing to the rule:** When you're getting ready to head out

For me, stop RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF CONVERSATION, and approach. A typical opener can be:

* ""Wow

Keep it simple. Think about it from her point of view... The only impression she has of you at this point is that you're 1) confident enough to approach her immediately without wavering and 2) direct enough with your desires to act on them immediately. That's fucking awesome! **That's about as good as first impressions get!**

Some of the greatest girls I've ever met came from direct use of the Three Second Rule. I remember one in particular... Gorgeous, fit, sexy, and she had just received her M.D. from Columbia. She absolutely adored me.

A few weeks into our fling we were cuddling in bed after sex and she said to me... *""The way you just... appeared out of nowhere the night we met... That was so hot

My mind was fucking blown. This shit works.

Try it out. If you apply the Three Second Rule

It's Saturday. Go meet some women.",,t5_2qhrv,1371309677.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/1gehj1/the_greatest_trick_i_know_for_beating_approach/
1352139394.0,12ofpw,Confidence for Beginners,TAOofSTEVE,626,112,64,"How to get confidence?  It is a question that commonly gets asked around here.  My usual answer has always been ""fake it until you make it.""  Which in my opinion is a fantastic answer

**Fear/ Self Doubt**

When I was in college

People weren't judging me.  I was judging myself through other people's eye's.  I was determining other people's opinions of me for them.  Are you doing the same thing?  Have you ever said to yourself ""she won't like me because I am too tall/short/skinny/fat/nerdy/introverted/ugly/boring/poor/un-athletic?  Have you avoided a social situation because you felt like you wouldn't fit in?  If so

Whenever somebody meets you, where you went to college, how many girls you've slept with, what job you have, how much money you make, how big your dick is.  They can only see what you allow them to see.  You create what they see.  You have the power to create their perception of you.  They don't know anything about your personality and if you don't allow them to see it, they will never get a chance to.  If you pull yourself out of the game because of your self doubts

Stop allowing fear of what others may think of you control who you are.  You are the one that controls how people perceive you.  How you project yourself is how others will perceive you.

**Negative Thinking**

Harboring negative thoughts leads to a vicious cycle.  Negative thinking leads to negative actions.  Negative actions lead to self doubt and low self esteem.  This leads to more negative thinking and the cycle continues in a downward spiral.  Luckily

First-  Get to the root of the negative thoughts.  Where do these negative thoughts stem from?  Get out a piece of paper.  Write a list of everything that you feel is holding you back.  This may be physical, or whatever.  Truly look within yourself and confront your fears.  Don't hold back.  Now this list in going to contain 2 different kind of things:  things you can change and things you can't.  

First, other people will perceive them this way too.  If you embrace them, then other people will embrace them too.  Once again, you hold the power to create other people's perceptions of you.

Second:  Start thinking positive (which goes hand in hand with: stop thinking negative).  Not just about women

**Putting it Together/ Self Actualization**

Maslow describes Self Actualization as ""the desire for self-fulfillment

Notice that he describes the ""desire"" as the means of achieving what one is capable of

*Facing your fears and self doubts so they can be removed.  

*Removing your own preconceived notions of how people judge you.  

*Developing your own sense of being of who you are and projecting that to other people.

**You don't have to worry about approaching.** They generally will approach you. The best way to get a girl to come to your table is simply to make eye contact with her and smile. She will make a beeline your way unless she's with another customer. **In the real world you still will need to learn to approach**

**By going to strip clubs

**You can practice being cocky/funny and not worry about failing.** It's her job to seduce *you*, her body language will tell you whether it's working or not. Again, you probably won't take her home with you, but you can still look for IOIs and, conversely, when she's turned off. Think of this as a chance to develop your calibration skills. 

**You can practice all the kino you want.** Strippers are masters of kino. Observe the way she touches you and don't be scared to touch her back. Don't do anything crude like grab her ass. Touch her arm, touch her hair while complimenting it, pull her close when she's talking and you can't hear what she's saying (or even if you can). 

**You can develop good eye contact skills.** Sometimes I go sit by the stage and wait for a girl to come dance for me. Instead of staring at her tits or ass

**Conversational Tips**

* Don't talk about sex right away

* Don't call her a ""stripper."" Call her a ""dancer."" She may still use that word

* Don't ask her about her job. Instead, where she wants to travel to etc. 

* I've found that most strippers really do like to dance and often even have ballet training

* At the start of a conversation

* Practice playful conversation. When girls ask me what I do I usually say I'm a CIA agent or an astronaut. When they ask me how old I am I say 74 (I'm in my mid forties).

* Practice talking about yourself in an interesting way. Talk about your passions and in particular *how they make you feel.* For example

* Compliment her about something besides her looks. I try to find one of her passions. One stripper I know is a really talented painter. Another is a competitive ballroom dancer who competes in a different city every week. If nothing else

* If the topic of sex comes up, instead of bragging or professing to be really good in bed, I talked in a cocky/funny way about how sometimes even an alpha male like me manages to fuck things up. The girls were eating it up.

* (As an aside

* Another playful way to talk about sex is to say you're terrible at it. I say something like ""I'm really bad in bed. I think it's because I have terrible spatial skills and always forget what goes where

* Many if not most of them will have boyfriends. Don't be afraid to ask them about their relationships. You'll be surprised by what they reveal. Never

* Make it clear that you don't judge her for what she does. I usually say something like ""I love strippers. Not because they get naked

* (If you do judge strippers

**Other Tips**

* Go early. I usually go around 9 pm. There aren't many customers and a lot of girls are just sitting around bored. I also tend to go during the week when it's not as busy. Sometimes the ratio is 3 women for every guy.

* Another advantage of going early: hitting a strip club *before* going out to the bars is a good

* Don't be a cheapskate. You don't have to throw crazy make-it-rain money at the stage

* If you want a lap dance, so if you want to work the room feel free."" 

* Tip the bartenders and waitresses well. I usually give one dollar per drink

* I usually go into a club assuming I will spend $100 in a couple of hours

* Make friends with the bouncers and wait staff. This is a very useful skill to develop for the real world.

* Don't spend much time by the main stage. I only go there for a few minutes at a time to tip a specific girl I like

* You won't be attracted to every girl who hits you up. Tell her right away (with a friendly smile) that you won't be buying a lap dance from her. Or if you're there with a friend

* Dress well. Even sex workers appreciate a man who has style.

* Stay away from the really drunk girls. They have issues. 

* I personally don't drink at strip clubs. I'm better able to observe the social dynamics when sober. Many clubs will give you free soft drinks if you tell them you're the designated driver.

For you busy redditors

1) Be more selfish.

2) Stop putting value on the opinions of strangers

3) Have a slightly unreasonable measure of confidence in yourself.

4) Be okay with being out of your comfort zone

5) Take a risk

6) Quit taking everything so seriously and have more fun.

**The grain of salt**: It is possible to take on all of these positive asshole qualities without being a dickheaded sociopath who steps all over everyone so that he can have a little fun. Just remember you can’t please everyone all the time and you shouldn’t try to.

1345531518.0,ykilt,The Strong Introvert,spaceclown,617,121,74,"I’ve had some ideas floating around in my head for a while that I’d like to share, [here](http://www.myersbriggs.org/my-mbti-personality-type/mbti-basics/extraversion-or-introversion.asp) is pretty good explanation)    


  

With terms like “alpha” and “life of the party” being thrown around, introverted self while still being extremely confident.    

  


**Body Language**     
This has absolutely been the most important key in my experience. Body language is such an incredibly powerful form of communication and most people aren’t consciously aware of it. You don’t have to say a damn word to communicate your interest in a girl


  

**Listening and Being Attentive**    
Being an introvert, while still being genuinely interested. Give them your full attention and don’t try to think about what to say next. Lose yourself in her eyes while she’s talking; fall between the spaces between her words. People talk because they want to be heard.    


  

**Being Concise**     
(ironic because this is turning into a novel) Less is more. If you have something to say, you don’t say anything because you don’t feel the need to pull something out of your ass. Get rid of filler words like “um” and “uh”, don’t stutter, and get right to the point. Let other guys try to shout over each other to get a girl’s attention while you sit back and give a flirty look in her direction. You are completely comfortable with not always talking, but this isn’t an excuse not to say anything. Remember, when you have something to say, you’ll say it.    


  

**Quiet Confidence**    
If you’re naturally more laid-back and contemplative, that combination of quiet confidence and not feeling the need to prove your worth to anyone around you drives girls crazy – they’ll really start qualifying themselves to you. They’ll start becoming more and more interested in your mystique and wonder why you aren’t trying to win their attention. They’re going to be curious about you because you don’t talk much about yourself or brag. Embrace your introversion; being able to enjoy your own company and be confident while being alone shows a strong independence that is very attractive.

- this whole game **isn't about just you**. you are giving people your value in the same way that you give people presents for their birthday. it feels good to give something and not receive something back immediately. weights off your mind. 
- what women (and men) look for is confidence. and not the external confidence of manly manliness that can take a truck to the pecs to shield a town of maidens (although that is a plus for many women). no
- you can't please the whole world. sometimes your face or the shoes you are wearing might piss someone off for no reason at all. oh well
- everyone wants to be loooovvveedddd. smile at strangers as you walk by them. raise your eyebrows a little for added effect haha. if you smile at a less-than-perfect-looking girl it might make her day
- you aren't better than anybody. we are all just as ""good"" as each other, too. Stop acting so pretentious ya fools**. but if we didn't as a society disapprove of being a dick, or spoiled, or arrogant, then the problems would never be solved. **THEREFORE, BE A GOOD PERSON.** make people around you be happy that they know you, and make the world a better place.

First, 210lbs, athletic build (I work out regularly), heterosexual, never been married, currently single and dating regularly. My resume includes somewhere's in the ballpark of 1000+ contacts and number closes, K-Closes, 500 plus first dates, and one MFFF experience. I've dated nearly every nationality you can imagine; Caucasian, Japanese

Long story short: I've been around.

All that said, how to interact with them, and how to get dates, bed partners, long term relationships, etc.

First and foremost; the majority of post on r/seduction and r/dating advice seem to be about ""How do I talk to this person about how I feel?"" What do I say? Where do I go to meet people? How do I avoid looking like a complete idiot and making a fool of myself? What's a ""golden opener""? How do I transition from a date to my place? How do I avoid getting ""friendzoned""? It seems many of the subscribers to r/seduction and r/dating advice are looking for a play by play manual of  meeting someone, getting physical, and having a relationship.  Well, seek no further, because I'm about to give you the answer, based solely on my experience:

THERE IS NO MAGIC ANSWER!!

See, and so-called ""Game Manuals"", don't teach you how to pick up chicks/dudes; they teach you how to control yourself, how to increase your level of personal confidence, and how to become more outgoing and social.  They teach you how to market yourself better to increase your odds of coming across more genuine, more sincere, and more appealing.  But even then, many times

If someone isn't in the right ""head space"" to meet someone, just got their heart stomped on, have a ton of personal baggage they need to work out, or otherwise, just have some stuff going on, they may not be receptive to your advances. 

Conversely, and they'll still give you a shot.  Believe me when I tell you, I've met and hooked up with women after saying some of the most outlandish shit you can imagine. I once met a girl at a shoe store while she was trying on heels. The first words I ever spoke to her: ""No... those shoes only work if we're fucking!"" Three nights later, we were! Likewise, I've been the picture of ""James Bond"" smooth, sending a woman a drink before going over and introducing myself, been the perfect gentleman, funny

If someone is into you, and if they are in the right frame of mind to engage you, if they are available (and sometimes even when they're not), then it'll happen. Otherwise, it won't. Period. There is no magic formula, no golden line, no super smooth approach, no subtle gesturing, wet in the panties into you.

But there are things that you can say and do, talk, move, and even smile to make those little receptors in a persons brain go ""Well what do we have here?""

If I approach a woman, there are times when I haven't said two words directly to a woman, and she's stuffing her number in my pocket. And again, it's not because of any super game or magic way I wiggle my hips when I walk. It's the overall presentation.

Now, but this post is already long enough. However, I'd be remiss if I didn't offer a few of the basics:

11. Wipe food/whatever off of his face.

12. Bounce her boobs when she knows he's watching. Same thing applies to the ass.

13. Give him ""accidental"" butterfly kisses while whispering to him (also applies when talking at a loud bar/party/club).

1338758445.0,uj32a,Best ways to socialize at a party.,TrippAdvice1,593,99,128,"It’s not easy to work a crowd. There are a few strategies I’ve learned that have made it possible for me to make friends with everyone I meet. Let’s start with the basics:


**1) Get to a party/event on time.** This is the most crucial tip. Everyone thinks that it’s cool to show up fashionably late to an event


**2) Introduce everyone.** No, but when you start introducing strangers it gives you a leg up. You can introduce all of the random people you’ve been talking to and you will appear to be the most popular person in the room. This is easy since you’ve already greeted people as they have been walking in. Know what’s even better? Your new friends will introduce you to their friends, and so on and so forth, which gives you social proof.


**3) Inside jokes seal the bond.** Creating inside jokes with people you just meet will form an extremely solid bond, which brings your connection to a deeper level. This one can get tricky though, so just be careful not to overdo it.


**4) Take it easy on the alcohol.** I am a big advocate of not going overboard on the drinking. This includes bars, don’t get me wrong, but the more you drink the less you’ll be able to have meaningful conversations. Getting to know a person on a deeper level is key to making new friends and attracting women. Alcohol may make the approach easier but it won’t help with the rest of your meet and greet. Instead, it will make you sloppy and disoriented. Plus, it’s in your benefit to master social skills, because you may end up at a party one day where they don’t serve alcohol.


**5) Get Facebooks, but get contact information from the men and women you meet.

• Facebook Info – this will help if you want to start your own party and invite people

• Emails – similar to getting someones Facebook info, you need to eventually get their phone number.

• Phone number – if you make a strong connection with somebody go right for the phone number. You’ll feel it when the time is right. If you’re sharing a lot of jokes and have been hanging out the entire night

The next time you get invited to a networking event or party use these tips and you will see success.

**TL;DR** - Be on time to a party.

more from my blog - www.trippadvice.com/blog

**EDIT:** - There have been some discussions on #1. I believe that if you know most of the group attending, or maybe were invited by a friend of a friend etc. It's in your benefit to meet everyone and socialize if you're not familiar with the scene. You need to get in there. There's also been talk about high value vs. low value people at the party. Yes, it definitely helps to get in with the high value people, but it's good that people see you being social with everyone. You want to try and be the most well liked and social person in the room. You don't want to leave somebody out because they are ""low value"". That might bite you in the ass later on. Thanks for all the upvotes guys.

1353537999.0,13la7m,Flirting for noobs,shifty84,638,151,97,"This is an edited post I originally put on /r/pua- a guy needed some flirting tips and no-one seemed willing to help him

____________________________________________

I'm gona take a stab at some general guidelines here dude, but it just takes experience to know what to look for.  You said you don't know how forward you should be- this is a completely subjective problem. Every girl you talk to will have a different definition of flirting, and the only way you're going to find out what that is, is by trying your luck. As you get more experienced, your calibration and adaptability will improve which will enable you to spot patterns and think on your feet. For now, all you need to do is stop thinking and just get out there and do it.  Here's a few tips, but remember they'll work better if you keep your frame fun and lightly sexual (which is pretty much the definition of flirting anyway!)

- Initiate contact whenever possible.  When you make a girl laugh, the most basic being that she will associate your touch with fun / laughter / feeling good. If you aren't close enough for the touch, make sure you are next time. Also, get them to touch you. I have a shaved head, and asking girls to rub it for whatever ridiculous reason (good luck, to see into the future... The more ridiculous the better) is a great way to get a laugh and initiate some contact.  Find something that works for you and run with it.

- Get her thinking sexy.  Flirting becomes a lot easier when the girl is on a similar wavelength as you- ie a sexual one.  A great way to instigate this is Neil Strauss' Fantasy Elicitation routine from Rules Of The Game.  The (very!) basics-- you swing the conversation something like- ""Don't believe everything you read- did you know there was a professor in the sixties who wrote a book about how women were incapable of sexual fantasies?! I know right?! Then this woman called Nancy Friday wrote a response called My Secret Garden- she interviewed hundreds of women about their fantasies and put them all in a book! A girl I dated read it, after which you can talk about something completely different and let her marinade in her own sexy thoughts.

- Pet names. Can also be combined with contact for added flirtatiousness. I use it liberally when asking for things, honeybun... Fancy buying my another drink? / passing me my coat? / taking me home?""  If you've kept an appropriate frame, you'll find that they'll usually reciprocate the name calling and the contact.

EDIT! If you feel this is too creepy / sleazy / not going to work (or even if you don't!) try calling her something based on where she's from / what her job is / what her hobbies are.  Credit to Beemeroo82- ""Something more teasy and less grimy- For instance, you're golden--so make sure she has something to work with. If you call her ""City"", make sure she knows you're from the country. My favorite was a girl from the south I called ""Sunshine""; she knew I'm from the north, so I became ""Snowflake"".""

- Favours. Not strictly flirting

EDIT 3- TIL this is called the Ben Franklin Effect - http://www.forbes.com/sites/sap/2011/11/16/do-me-a-favor-so-youll-like-me-the-reverse-psychology-of-likeability/

- Agree and amplify.  A great technique which can be used all day every day, ""now if you'll excuse me, I do have other guests to be attending to..."" to which she replied ""ugh! You're such a terrible host!"" He came back with ""You have no idea! I threw a pool party last week... There were drowned naked people everywhere...""  Again, the more ridiculous / lightly sexual the better, as long as you stay confident and keep smiling.

Give those a try dude, isn't going to work on a girl who has already decided to friend-zone you. It's always going to work better on a girl you've just met- initiate your frame early!  Good luck, and let us know how you get on.

**Qualifying women**

*""I wonder what she's like.""* &lt;-- This is your new mindset. Embrace it. Fall in love with it. It is your new best friend.

Plenty has been said about the importance of having an *abundance mentality* as opposed to a scarcity mindset. Women want men who have options. Employers are more likely to hire employees who have other job options. The best negotiators make sure they have viable

But how does one develop an abundance mentality towards women when they've never even kissed one? That, and most have utterly failed. Until now. **The answer lies in these five simple words: ""I wonder what she's like.""**

As you go through the self-improvement process, values, and needs. This is a natural part of becoming a man.

With that in mind, and things that fit your desires is only natural. No longer are you thinking, *""Will this girl like me?""* Instead you are thinking, *""I wonder what she's like.""*

**To put it another way, but *""What do you do for a living?""* takes on a whole new meaning when you follow it up with *""Why did you get into that field?"" and genuinely care how she answers.* 

Other Helpful Phrases:

* *""I'm curious about that. Tell me more.""*

* *""What are you passionate about?""*

* *""Why this school? Why not somewhere else?""*

* *""What made you choose this city for your vacation?""*

Learn to seek out the truth. What makes her tick? What is she really passionate about? Is she worthy of your time? Is she girlfriend material or is she someone you will want to invite out to help you cut the line at nightclubs? Figure that shit out. **This is how you develop an abundance mentality when you don't have abundance yet.** This is how you attract women.

**The guys who inquisitively seek out the truth like this are the guys who cause girls to say ""I met this guy last night who just... gets me. It was amazing.""** Be one of those guys.

---

**Calibration**

Calibration ties right in with this. You MUST understand how different people, and passions. Other times she wants to discuss current events.

**There is only one constant: It is YOUR job

I am not going to tell you how calibration works in every situation. That is something you MUST learn for yourself. Without reference experiences

The trick here is getting out of your comfort zone. Push your limits, say something crazy, mess up a girl's hair out of nowhere, pick her up in the air and spin her around, talk to her about sports, ask her about her family, ask her interview questions about her job and where she went to school. Get a drink thrown in your face. Try everything! Over time you will intuitively grasp how to act in different situations and what you can and can't get away with.

But throughout it all

---

**Action Items**

1) Bust out your notebook. Write down a list of women (real, friends, crushes, whoever) that you find attractive for some reason. Try to jot down at least 10-20. Leave space between each name.

2) Next to each name

Examples: *her hair, can drink as much as I can, plays guitar, likes Pink Floyd, plays sports, nice breasts, big ass, Latina, atheist

3) Look at the whole mess of text you just wrote. Just soak it in. Stare it for a few minutes with some music on in the background. Just soak it in while you visualize these various women and what they do for you.

4) Repeat the Action Items 5-8 in Part 3

5) Go to a high-energy nightclub or bar on a weekend **with the sole intention of getting rejected in the most hilarious fashion possible.** (This mindset is important. Bring friends if possible.) Think of crazy things to ask and do to women

Examples: *Rub a girl's head and mess up her hair a little.* *Ask a group of girls their thoughts on The Human Centipede series.*

Push your comfort zone. Laugh at the hilarity of the rejections

So a week ago

We grabbed some frozen yogurt, then just grew more passionate. Feeling eachother, kissing her neck, I suggested we move it some place more private. In my head, I thought the back seat of my car. She tells me that she has a house all to herself. Well gee. I'd be a fool to turn that down right?

So I follow her to her place. On the way we got blocked behind some train tracks as a train stalled, being inexperienced, I honestly wasn't anticipating that happening anyways. 

We get to her place, we start taking off clothes and really feeling eachother up. She just tells me ""I don't usually do this, ever. (Meet a dude in a club, go on a date, take him back to her place, then sleep with him on the first date) There's just something about you""  She just asks me if I want to do it but warns me that she doesn't have any protection. I reached in my pocket pulled out a condom. I may have been a virgin but ALWAYS be prepared gentlemen. 

And so it went. People always told me my first time would suck

On the contrary. If anything, and adequately met expectations. And my God either I'm a natural or she's just incredible at faking, but the sounds out of this girls mouth were exquisite. Couple that with a shaky headboard the kept slamming into the back wall. Good Lord. 

After we finished the first time

Twice. I ended up spending the night there sleeping with her. We woke up a few hours later. She said ""Well there's one thing left to do"" I was out of condoms

So we took a shower. Then we had to part ways. Nothing weird

I attribute a lot of my success to this place. I can't speak for how much of it really applied technically speaking. A lot of it has just been improving my mindset, do things, have fun. If I wasn't encouraged to go out more, have a more interesting life, and just learn to seize a moment when it's there, this would have never in a million years have even started, let alone escalate to what it did. 

So thank you all of you. I'm eternally grateful for all the help you've provided and all the improvement I've seen in myself. Life is good.

The same goes for escalating; if we're at her place making out on the couch and I want to eat her pussy, I tell her ""I want to eat your pussy.""

If you become more honest and shameless you will start getting into some pretty fun situations.  The last step of this is to accept full responsibility for everything that happens.  No girl wants to feel like a slut or like she was used

Would love to hear your suggestions

&gt; ~~""I need to get a cute girl so I can be happy""~~

&gt; **""I need to be happier

So important. If you haven't grasped this concept - this is all you need to learn. A girl can't make you happy. A girl can multiply your happiness, then start thinking about how you can bring girls into your awesome new world.

**Edit**: [puzzlecracker suggested](http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/wnbu6/a_summary_of_mindset_changes/c5evu18) that ""I need to"" would be better replaced with ""I choose to""

&gt; ~~""Girls want rich

&gt; **""Girls want guys who are happy with who they are. Often those guys go on to be more successful

This is a bit controversial, working out and getting a hair cut. Not instantly - your style is something you'll have to work on over time. But the simple fact that you're taking action to continuously improve yourself is attractive in itself.

&gt; ~~""So

&gt; **""So what if I get rejected.""**

Granted, think about the worst that could happen. A slap from a girl you'll never see again? That would be a fun story to tell. A bunch of people laugh at you? Unlikely, others are jealous of your huge balls of steel and lamenting that they couldn't do the same. Now think about the best that could happen.

&gt; ~~""How can I possibly talk to that cute girl?""~~

&gt; **""How can I possibly pass up this opportunity to talk to that cute girl?""**

This is one I still struggle with. Having this mindset can be painful

&gt; ~~""I hope she doesn't think I'm hitting on her""~~

&gt; **""I hope she knows I'm attracted to her""**

Guys

&gt; ~~""Oh shit, how do I answer… Just be polite...""~~

&gt; **""I like your boots! Where'd you get them?""**

You don't need to reply to every question. A conversation doesn't have to be question, answer. If you think of something cool, bring it up. Outside of deep, meaningful conversations most people just ask questions to fill conversation anyway, they don't really care about your answer.

&gt; ~~""Does she like me?""~~

&gt; **""Do I like her?""**

WHO CARES if she likes you. Don't decide for her. You need to think about whether you like her. Every time you find yourself asking ""Does she like me?""

&gt; ~~""I need to read /r/seduction more so that I can be prepared for every awkward situation""~~

&gt; **""I need to get myself into more awkward situations so that I can understand what those guys at /r/seduction are talking about""**

&gt; ~~""What do I say next?""~~

&gt; **""""**

Yes, witty stuff just pops into your mouth and you say it before even thinking it. Getting to be 'in the moment' is hard; you have to be completely comfortable in your environment and with yourself. I struggle to get into it, but when you get there it feels oh so great, especially for an ex-SAP like myself. I've found meditation/relaxation can help sometimes. Other than that, you just have to put yourself into uncomfortable situations until they become comfortable.

&gt; ~~""What do I do to make this girl attracted to me?""~~

&gt; **""What can I improve to make myself more attractive?""**

Focussing on trying to get one girl, it makes the whole situation more stressful. Work on yourself, and the rest will happen naturally. You can be noble and loyal when you've got the girl if you want.

&gt; ~~""If I can just [be good with girls/get this job/own this car/have sex/move to europe] I'll be happy.""~~

&gt; **""If I can just improve this [small thing]

1363879398.0,1aqi5v,Aloofness: A Complete Guide,,627,147,149,"Preface: Can we please have some new content on this subreddit every now and then? I'd be happy with just one somewhat original and/or rarely-discussed post / idea on the front page every *few* days. More mechanics



**ALOOFNESS**


Aloofness is *not* playing hard-to-get. 

Displaying aloofness to a girl is going to turn her on more than pretty much anything. Makes sense because it's way harder to display aloofness than it is to display confidence, you get the picture.

Merriam-Webster defines aloof as: ""removed or distant either physically or emotionally""

In terms of seduction

But this idea of aloofness *will not* result in anything but a pissed-off and confused girl who either thinks you're an asshole, or a combination of them all. 

So, while otherwise acting in the exact opposite way



                              BUT WHAT DOES IT MEAN???



This means that when a girl says something indirectly flirtatious, in either your verbal subtexts or body language, will actually demonstrate to her higher value, escalate the interaction, and make her laugh (All of which will increase attraction). 


(Don't be aloof when a girl flirts in a direct manner, or anything else that can be taken as directly coming onto you. If a girl decides you're cute or cool enough to break the social norm and be direct, you best be direct too)



**EXAMPLES OF ALOOFNESS IN ACTION:**

*1). Girl: ""Are you gay?""*

A girl asking you if you're gay is on the same level as if she asked you if you were single. It means she's interested in you

You could say answer with ""No."" or ""Why? Are you interested?"" (A favorite here). The second response is better because it's not straightforward (+1)

OR

*""Are you gay?""*

*""Whyy does every girl keep asking me that??""*

This is a much better answer because she's being indirectly flirtatious, and more socially-aware guys. You say: No, I'm not gay, and it answers her question but doesn't do anything else. If she also did that as a shit-test, you failed. You say: ""Why? Are you interested?"" and it shows that you get she's flirting and you're into it, but it's a little cocky (Cocky's good but aloof's better!), and she can easily get embarrassed and defensive: ""No! I was just asking"" *ignores you for the rest of the night*

But if you look her straight in the eyes, it changes the sentence's tone), she’ll have a laugh and she’ll know you’re interested (You demonstrated it non-verbally), and that it also implies you get asked that all the time by other girls (Pre-selection. All girls know this is a flirtatious question). 


*2). Girl that you're obviously hitting on: ""Why don't you have a girlfriend?""*

Again, attractive dude. This is always a shit-test, and/or a question to determine if you're a player. 

Also, which is why it's always a shit-test from girls. 

Choose aloof:
*""Why don't you have a girlfriend?""*

*""Because I don't know how to talk to girls!! Will you teach me?""*

Again, you're the one who came up to her hitting on her, and you're staring her right in the eyes and saying all the right things. You obviously know how to talk to girls. Your response makes her laugh, she starts complimenting you (""Yes you do, you're so funny, witty, etc) and the most passive-aggressive question she could've ever asked a stranger is successfully deflected without being wimpy (Beta-response) or sleazy (PUA-response). 


*3). Girl: ""I wish I had a guy."" ""I'm having a lot of trouble finding a boyfriend."" ""No cool guys want to date me.""*

She has to be giving off some big IOIs when saying this one (Otherwise it's just a girl bitching). Any variation of this + eye contact and a smile means you're in. But you don't say something like: ""Aw I'm sure you'll find someone."" or ""I'll be that guy!!"" or all is lost.

Alooof:
*""I'm having a lot of trouble finding a boyfriend.""*

*""Ohmygod, but then I have to try and get as close as possible without them noticing because it's the only intimate contact I get.""*



**DO YOU SEE WHY ALOOF?**

Being aloof works on so many levels. You notice that all of the examples from the girls could also be considered shit-tests. Being aloof *passes* the shit-test by not being straightforward and making her laugh

It increases her attraction to you because being aloof takes: Self-awareness, a solid understanding of body language, vocal tonality, and timing, and (What girls appreciate most-of-all), not taking yourself so seriously. It's cockiness without being cocky, self-deprecating without being self-deprecating. That's aloofness in seduction. Girls are socially aware enough to immediately recognize and acknowledge everything going on behind an aloof comment

Best of all, and turn her off. By being aloof, you're keeping her interest by showing your interest in your tone, subtext, and body language, all the while maintaining the ""chase"" aspect of the game. You make an aloof comment, then ask her out five minutes later. 


Note: It *does* require some sort of attraction and intent on her part because being aloof is a *reaction* to a girl's flirtation

Also

**EDIT:** 

I've read the dissenting replies. Here's my counterpoints and clarification: A lot of contention is just based off of me simply using the word aloof. I literally listed the textbook definition; I do know what it means. James Bond (I've only seen Craig's films) isn't aloof when it comes to women

Aloof in the way you guys are describing it would be how Tom Cruise acts as Jack Reacher when that twenty-something girl hits on him at the bar. If you haven't seen it, and that doesn't make the girl very happy.

So in this post, having strong body language, and passing shit-tests (Much of the criticism here says that what I call aloofness is merely a combination of these things), there's more going on behind a truly aloof comment. I want to restate what I said before: Aloofness is cockiness without being cocky, self-deprecating without being self-deprecating, and what makes an aloof comment different from any other response you'd give to a shit-test is that you're showing that you don't take yourself too seriously.

**EDIT 2:**


*The only girls you can truly be traditionally aloof (Cold and emotionally distant is traditional aloofness, like you don't give a shit about her, even though you actually really want to get to know her and fuck her. It's fake, and girls can see through the act. You can't act like you don't care about a girl while trying to make meaningful conversation with her at the same time.

I'm a little AFC bitch right now, and keep the woman of my dreams, get married, and have a family.  I met this guy only twice, but he randomly called me today.  I told him about it, and he said he had advice for me.  I just knew I had to speak to him.  I'm writing this for you, but also for myself, and has been married for about 30 years straight now.  I told him how I've gotten into the habit of going to bars alone and hitting on girls.  He said that was interesting, and so much of what he said sounded like he was a pickup artist

**Advice**

He told me that I need to get in control of my emotions.  When women sense an emotional response to something in the relationship, his wife told him that she wanted to take a vacation out of the country to visit family.  He really didn't want to go and didn't want her to go, but instead, he said, ""Oh, that sounds like a great idea, honey.""  She wanted to know if he wanted to come.  He said he didn't want to, or go somewhere else, agree and escalate

He also told me that what I needed to do right now was to work on myself.  He also said that working on yourself is a constant process.  He called it ""upgrading"".  Always upgrade, because if I can't do that, then this will happen again.  Women want a strong man, and they constantly test and try to peel away at it if they see an opening.  If you never give them that opening, they won't be able to do anything, and they will stay happy, safe, because they don't have emotions that they can tug on.  But a good guy is someone who has emotions, and that so many younger guys just don't know this.  He said that if I was like this with my ex-GF, and that he is a very emotional person.  But when it comes to women and everything in life

""If you love something

""You can't start love if it isn't there

I told him that it'll take a few months to get over it.  He said, but it can be over quicker if you take an active role of changing your habits.""  This made me feel awesome, because I know I don't have to be stuck in the doldrums of love for so long, as long as I truly make an effort to change my habits.

**Context:**

My ex-girlfriend told me that she sometimes preferred hanging out with her friends rather than me.  I always tried to not be needy and let her do what she wanted.  However, and had I known better, I would have stopped giving these emotional responses.  She also had some differences in personality that might have led to an eventual breakup, but I'm certain the reason it crumbled is because of these emotional responses.  Women will unknowingly destroy relationships if they can.  That's part of being a woman and how they find a strong, good man.  I stopped reading seddit and posting actively, because I felt I couldn't get good advice on PUA relationships here.  I went to relationship_advice and got shitty advice there, most likely from women.  He said that there are tonnes of people out there with the wrong answer.  He said that I need to find the people who have something to show for it.  He said if you need help accomplishing something, work

This girl always told me I was super attractive, intelligent, and hard-working.  Her parents and family adored me.  Her friends would buy me drinks at the bar.  I am complete boyfriend material, with money, my own pad, a car, a job, and a life outside of work.  It doesn't matter, but what makes you a man.

**Going forward:**

I posted this, if anything.  I didn't know what behavior to avoid in the future, if anything.  I tried to use some David DeAngelo cocky and funny type gimmicks to eke the relationship on, but ultimately there was a rather quick breakdown of things, because I can't control my emotions.  I used to think that wearing my emotions on my sleeves was a good thing.  It is a good thing in some ways.  It's good to show that you're upset when you're having a bad day from work, or to show your happiness when you are enjoying your girl's company.  It's bad to show your emotions when they show you are weak in the relationship.  But don't be mean about being 100% in your own space, thinking about yourself first.  Just be unreactive, and kind of positive.  He also said to not show too much enthusiasm when saying stuff like ""Oh, and got some numbers


**TLDR:** Advice from an old natural about women and relationships.  Knowledge like this is extremely rare and precious

Note: His wife is hot as hell, but definitely a character.  I've only met him twice before, and he is a such a giver.  His wife made me dinner, because I couldn't eat all day.  Yesterday is the first day I've been able to sleep without alcohol, not even wanting it.

Second Note: Just like the hottest women are the ones with the strongest shit tests and bitch shields, etc., but not emotionally stable.  They are okay with this, because worse women have lower standards in a man.  I want a 10 on the outside and the inside, and the only way for this to happen is for me to be a true man.

1365717998.0,1c5y0a,Alpha male mindset: Conveying high status and high value through your actions,,589,122,96,"One of the best ways to earn respect and admiration from those around you as well as to attract women is to show that you are a high status individual with high self value. Power can easily be conveyed with these two traits.

On showing High Status:

High status can be defined as a position of prominence or importance compared to other people around you. Someone with high status is most likely someone you look up to try to emulate. High status is also one of the elements that woman find very attractive. 

To convey to others that you are a man with high status

1. Have your shoulders pushed back and stand straight

2. Make sure to slow down when talking, many don't see the big deal in this but it is a very subtle way to show that you have confidence.

3. Have your head face straightforward and your eyes ahead of you

4. When standing or walking, it can be seen as being closed off to others.

5. Sit up straight or lean back slightly

6. If you have any bad habits


On conveying high self value:

High self value can be defined as someone's overall self evaluation and sense of self worth of themselves. People with high self value give off a positive vibe and are appreciated by their peers. A man with high value has a much higher chance of winning over women compared to the man with low self value.

The best way to show others that you have high self value is through how you treat yourself and how you treat those around you.

1. Do not doubt yourself out loud ever, and move on. 

2. Do not bitch

3. Carry yourself in a positive manner no matter where you are

4. Always be improving yourself

5. When with others

6. If someone attempts to lower your self value

7. Don't take everything so seriously. Do not care what others opinions are of you. Stand up for your own beliefs and values.

8. When a girl is acting out of line. Put your foot down and let her know your boundaries

Following this guide is one of the easiest and quickest ways to becoming a man with high status and high value.

1364433764.0,1b5e44,Here’s a story I hope will inspire you. This is my transformation. Also a BIG thank you to seddit.,Captain-Magic,569,104,59,"What's up seddit, I'm far from being a PUA, you can still switch it all around with time and effort.

**Highschool and early college**

So it all starts when I'm in 10th grade in highschool. By this time I was a lonely mess starting to get out of his teenage years. My father was rather absent from my life from about when I was 10 years old and onwards, and preferred those activities to chilling with friends.

I'd fall for girls really easily, waiting for the girls I loved to log on and proceed to chat with them like an extremely needy bitch. I was desperate, and lonely. My heart was broken over and over again. One time, a girl I loved made out with a guy she had disqualified to me, right in my face. That event alone plunged me in a pretty deep depression.

I graduated highschool and started college in a completely depressed state. Skipping class or arriving drunk/stoned in them. I was a wreck. I also wasn't realizing the consequences of my actions and I wasn't taking responsibility for them. Always blaming external factors. I got into a 1 month relationship with a girl I wasn't into because I was desperate. I was practically misogynistic: slut shaming women all the time for banalities. Putting them on pedestals, that it was going down the drain and that I'd never attract women. I was seeing everyone around me getting into relationships (College, huh) and fucking here and there, while I was completely inactive.

People didn't respect me that much, rarely participating in conversation.

**Then things started to change**

I enjoyed gambling quite a lot (In Quebec the legal age is 18), titled *Read'em and Reap*. It's a book about reading body language to maximize profits in poker.

This led me to discovering ***What Every BODY Is Saying***, I started paying more attention to the way people act and react to different situations. Every day, I'd really concentrate with every customer I'd help out to determine exactly what it is he/she was thinking or if what I had said was good/bad. I gradually got better and better at it, just as anyone here can. Seriously, pick up that book, it's what opened my mind and ""prepped"" me for the seduction notions I learned 2-3 years later in life.

So my interest for social interactions in general was constantly increasing, but now at least, I was becoming rather charismatic. I knew how to hold people's attention, tell interesting stories, make people laugh, etc. ***Non verbal communication is the shit, everyone. Read up on it

**Turning point: discovering seddit**

I joined reddit around the end of 2011, so you know where the fuck I'm coming from.* I was seeing people recommending *How To Win Friends And Influence People* and *The Game* everywhere, so I decide to check them out. Lo and behold, my mind was fucking blown, by both books. Simple notions such as smiling, complimenting people properly, etc. were dawning on me for the first time. As for Neil Strauss, *like fucking crazy*. I was fortunate enough to meet a new gang of friends

These guys gave 0 shits. They walked around the club beaming, doing the ""cheers"" to practically everyone they crossed in the club, boy or girl. It felt so good going out with them. I was freaking out. Their behavior was really contagious and I really wanted to *be* like those guys, especially after discovering seddit! I started investing more on my appearance, getting clothes that fit me well, keeping my hair shorter, etc. I started feeling really good about myself. **Guys, check male fashion websites. Imitate people who are known for their sense of fashion, getting rejected and accepted

After going out extensively and constantly putting myself out there throughout the whole spring, which were the ones I'd always get oneitis for before. Fall came around and random girls from school started messaging me on facebook (sometimes girls I didn't even know) because they wanted to talk to me. I was becoming more known. People had noticed my change. *I* had noticed my change.

I was much more confident, and didn't seek the approbation of my peers to make sure they were good. I became a leader. Some girls would fall for me. Some of them even had boyfriends. **Shit finally started working out really well in my everyday life, not just my “clublife”**.

So here I am, who has a boyfriend, admitted her feelings for me. She was a girl I had chased like a needy bitch about 2 years prior, and she rejected me, got into a relationship, etc. The fact she told me she was into me really made me realize the extent of my change, and prompted me to write this. It's like I'm still not grasping this is happening..

If you took the time to read this post, especially the mods Tofu, Curveball and Throwaway. You guys were a true inspiration through it all and you helped me achieve my goal of knowing how to seduce women. I love you guys. I'm getting the hang of it.

**Logistics**

As you gain experience

Logistics refers to all the external factors that you can control. How do you ask for the number, how you get her from point A to point B, what do you have in your room. It means having a plan and trusting in it. It also means reflecting on your experience and developing a style that you can comfortably enjoy.

You are not allowed to talk to girls until you go through the next two steps. Trust me on this.

---

**#1: Where can you get her alone? What do you have there?**

Whether you are looking for a one night stand or your next girlfriend, you're in good shape, but even if you live with your parents, fear not... Where there's a horny guy, there's a way.

Get creative and really think about all the different locations you can get alone after hours. Is there an isolated beach nearby? Great

**NOTE: I'm using these as examples of creativity if you don't have a good place to take a girl. However, you're making your life much harder than it has to be.**

As for the types of things you need in your place. Honestly, and music, TV, or a computer, you're in good shape. Everything you add beyond that can be helpful, but no need to go crazy. Adding a bottle of wine and some spirits will be the icing on the cake.

Don't overthink this stuff. Yes, drugs, sex swings, lube, that mural you painted in art school, and your photo collection from your trip to Peru are awesome, but they're not really helping you get laid. **Keep your place clean and live in a place you are PROUD to be in. That's what is most important at the end of the day.** By the time the girl comes home with you, and neither one helped me pull better than the other.

---

**#2: Know your city and know your neighborhood**

You need to become an expert in your city, restaurants, date spots, etc. Remember back in [Part 2](http://redd.it/11yjkw) when you came up with a list of great date ideas? Yeah, go revisit that list and try harder. Discover all that's great around you. Talk up strangers and ask them for cool things to do. Be a tourist in your own city for a weekend. Love where you live.

A guy who can serve as the gatekeeper to all the wondrous sights and experiences in your city is incredibly attractive. Don't take that lightly. Most people go through life going to the same shitty restaurants and bars every week. But you aren't ""most people."" You are unique and better than them. Women will gravitate to you.

Now that you are starting to really know your city

Visit every single bar and cafe in your neighborhood. Visit every park and shopping center and see what they have to offer. Go on a walking tour next weekend. Know your neighborhood like the back of your hand.

I'll demonstrate why further down below, but I would bet every dollar I have that they would have more success taking them to the closest shitty bar.

OK

---

**#3: Getting her number**

By this point in the guide

I'm going to make this section really easy for you. **Getting her number is as simple as saying

No gimmicks, touch, and conversation, you won't need anything fancy. 

That being said

* 1) Plant the seeds for your date ahead of time. Find out what she likes. Bring up that awesome bar/art gallery/cafe/whatever that she would like that you've researched ahead of time. Adding

* 2) Throughout the course of flirting and building rapport, or playful nickname. You can reference this in your text messages later on. David Wygant refers to this as ""bringing her back to the moment"" and it's a tried and true method. 

*Real-world Examples:*

* A girl wouldn't give me her name upfront. I said, *""Yo Larry, what are you doing this weekend?""* which brought her back to the moment when she felt strong attraction to me.

* I asked a girl to watch my jacket, I could say *""Tonight's my last night before the agency reassigns me. Wanna make waffles and have a pillow fight?""*

As you develop your personality and spontaneity, and nicknames. It's fun and gives every interaction its own unique essence. Oh, and put a little note referencing this next to her name in your address book.

One final tip... When you get her number

---

**#4 Texting the girl &amp; setting up dates**

After getting the number, calibrate your text accordingly.

As far as general texting goes... There are plenty of guys who text humorous notes, building attraction through dozens of text exchanges. This can be very effective, so if it works for you, that's awesome.

My stance, you can stick to texting only for scheduling real-life meetups where you can escalate physically. Do you really feel that 140 characters on a small LCD screen properly represents who you are? I certainly don't.

Here are my favorite texts to use. Feel free to use them often. They work.

* **""How's your day going?""** (Give her a chance to respond. Her lady parts will tingle when she gets a message from ""that cool guy she met."" You sexy devil you!)

* **""What's your schedule like this week?""** (Let her tell you when she's free. She's not dumb

* **""Sweet. Come to [INSERT VENUE] with me. I'll be there Thursday at 8.""** (Hot girls HATE when men require lots of back and forth to schedule plans. Be upfront with her. She will appreciate it.)

As always

---

**Dates**

Plan your dates in advance with a mental map for how you're going to get her from point A to point B. Yes, GO!) but it's not going to be ideal for getting her to the final destination (on top of your penis.)

I always start out by suggesting a shitty bar near my place. Why near my place? Because it will make moving her there 10 times easier than if we have to drive across town. Why a shitty bar? Because then I can use my favorite line in all of seduction

Some tips for what to during the date:

* Hug her at the start
* Don't even discuss who pays the bill. If you have the money
* If you follow my advice and do your first date at a bar
* Try to sit in a corner booth or at the bar so your legs can touch. This will let you maintain strong physical contact and physically escalate.
* Sometimes
* Every thirty minutes or so
* If you're not 21
* ALWAYS BE ESCALATING! (More on this in the next chapter)

You must have a plausible reason for why you're bringing her back to your place. Yes, or check out that new Youtube video, or show her your stamp collection, you need to plan this ahead of time. Experience certainly pays dividends here, but the truth is, as long you have done a good job generating attraction thus far, you'll be fine.

Expect her to offer some resistance when you try to bring her home. Throwing out a ""I don't sleep with someone on the first date."" or ""No sex, to make her as comfortable as possible. Also when you start to fool around, *""I don't kiss and tell.""* goes a long, long way.

---

**Action Items**

1) Follow parts 1 &amp; 2 above to the letter. Do not pass go. Do not collect $200 until you do this. This is one of the most important things you'll ever do for your love life.

2) Get out your notebook. Write out 30

2) Go out with the goal of getting phone numbers. Follow the advice above and try for 10 numbers. Then 20. Then 30. You need to gain experience with a variety of women. There is no way to gain this other than brute force.

3) Text the numbers you receive and try to set up first dates. Try to schedule 5-10.

4) During these dates, don't even worry about sex. This subtle change in mindset has proven very effective for me. Sex is a natural by-product of the process.**)",Comprehensive,False,,t5_2qhrv,1374516744.0,,moderator

I am not a major player in this sub. I don't have a largely active history in the seduction community. I am not a natural. I was neither a player, is just a natural learner. I'm skilled at adapting and evolving who I am for the better. That is my only claim to success. I pulled himself up, gained confidence, and started being pleased with myself, all on my own. I can talk to a lady I find attractive at Barnes &amp; Noble/Sear's/Joe's Crab Shack/wherever, and if we click, I take her out. I'm involved in this community because I want my fellow men to be the best they can; and because I know that I can never stop improving myself as well. I'm here for you.

I want to see my fellow man pick himself up, and get what they want out of the night. I want to help people that *want* to improve; to give others what they need to at life, starting from the inside, out.

Now I've got some bad news: Here's where this starts to be a rant. We have a cancer. It's killing us slowly. We need to burn this tumor out

You know what's killing us, lead her on to think there's something more, and kick her to the curb after a one-night stand so they can move to the next piece of meat. You know what's killing us, guys? When we objectify the holy fuck out of everything. You know what's killing us, guys? When we use any means necessary to justify the end. You know what's killing us, guys? That piece of shit TV show that teaches you how to be a “pick up artist” when most of the time they just hit the club, find the drunkest women they can

The Golden Rule

Look at it like this, daughter, whatever. Imagine someone doing to them what you are doing to the ladies you are talking to. Would you be pleased with someone seducing your daughter, taking her home, leading her on, sleeping with her, and never talking to her again, but it's unhealthy.

Now hold on, what are we supposed to do?” Take it easy. I understand. Remember, I'm one of you and I love you, and I want you to be the best. This is where the rant ends, and the want for improvement begins.

I *want* you to go out on the town. I *want* you to have a good time. I *want* you to approach women you have an attraction towards, funny, socially-active, attractive young man, *without* having to personally censor all of the horrible shit you did to people along the way.

Be clear about your intentions before you sleep with someone. If you think “I'm only sexually attracted to you, guys. Fuck the sex. This isn't even ABOUT the women. **This is about you**... you growing into the best you can be, having fun along the way, cherishing this time of your life, and being a *POSITIVE INFLUENCE* on everyone you meet. Don't drag this community into the depths of misogynistic sleazy shame it's currently headed for.

I *want* you to post Field Reports. I *want* you guys to help each other out. I *want* you guys to grow. I *want* you to have fun, too. I *want* you to be happy with who you are, because that is the most important thing. If you aren't happy with yourself, nobody else will ever make you happy. I **need** you guys to be so goddamn happy, confident, charismatic, and badass human beings that I would introduce you to my sister if you asked; and I need you to respect the fellow human beings you interact with.

Go ahead

1347329740.0,zoqsu,Why Yoga will help your game,ad-guy-13,562,109,137,"I'm new to pickup but not to Yoga. Seeing a lot of parallels as I learn more about this. Taken a lot from this community so wanted to add this for anyone who hasn't considered this before.

1) Breathing

Yeah yeah, only to re-gain control by focusing inward - simply on my breathing. Then - you kill it. 

2) Body Language

Yoga is all about alignment. Shoulders back, you just 'walk' differently. That whole ""imagine a string pulling your head"" thing doesn't even need to be thought about. It's just how you stand and walk. Since I got out of my LTR 2 months ago women have just been talking to me more, and last weekend a WW's girlfriend asked me ""how did you go from 5 years w/ 'ex' to this?"". I told her security. But it's my body language that conveyed it, not what I was saying. 

3) Exercise

I'm not really a gym rat. It just gets boring. I've been implementing 2 weight work outs a week with my standing 2-3 yoga classes and I am shaping up quickly. And it's fun - my body never really knows what to expect. Throw in a few days a week of x-training / running and you'll see results fast. 

4) Practice... not the Yoga kind.

Women are really hot in Yoga classes. And they don't wear any clothes. They aren't going there to pick up

5) Inner Game

How do you build confidence? By defeating your inner demons. We've all got them. We all ignore them, and that shit comes out in your practice. When you've been standing on one leg for 5 minutes and you keep falling you realize the same shit keeps going through your head. Make a mental note to journal on that later.  By actually working through your shit it will no longer control you - you'll begin controlling it. Then your best self starts shining through.

1341583915.0,w4nrd,How a girl wants to be picked up at a club,gh0stfl0wers,761,304,344,"Someone posted a thread in AskReddit asking how to pick up a girl at a club. Didn't get much attention

American guys seem to always go for the grinding, I've been trying to figure out how guys pick up girls here, because I just find it so much more pleasant. This seems to be the common way to do it. Really wish it was more common in the States. 

1. Choose target. 

2. Start dancing near here

3. Try to make eye contact. Smile if eye contact is achieved. If she smiles back

4. If she doesn't move away or show discomfort

5. If she takes your hand pull her a little closer. Not so close that you're forced to rub your crotches against each other. Just close enough so that it is established that you 2 are dancing together. **Edit:** If you are confused about how the hell you're supposed to dance with a girl without rubbing your penis on her: Just be relaxed

6. If she seems to be having a good time with you and doesn't try to get the fuck away ASAP

If you do this I'm sure any girl would highly appreciate the fact that you didn't just come up from behind and start danceraping her. You're bound to get at least a phone number from it. This has worked on me and other female friends many times. 

If at any point during this process she shows discomfort just get the fuck away from her or you will forever be known as that creepy stalker dude at the club who kept staring at her.

**On Direct vs. Indirect Game**

On how pick up is now generally moving away from routines/indirect and towards just pure direct intent. How do you feel about this? 

* 	Trends in pickup are kind of idiotic. One does what works.

Great quote from a Redditor:

* 	""Look guys


**More Direct PUA Tips**


On Looks

* 	If you can't fix it

On Peacocking

 * [the line is] Are you wearing the clothes or are they wearing you?

How to game in a small college/small social circle

* If it's a small town and you see everyone a lot

Favorite place to meet new people:

* Coffee shops are always great. Where ever you go talk to everyone. You'll find the best place that way.

Information Overload

* And don't become an information junkie. Just take the material you need RIGHT NOW to get past your current sticking point. Then use it to get past that point. Then go back to the well and get what you need next. There's a form of procrastination called perfect preparation. And it ends with guys buying a lot of ""products"" and not getting outdoors and actually socially interacting.

**Inner Game and Approach Anxiety Related** 


4 Rules on Approach Anxiety

* Rule one of AA: Life is fun if you open your mouth.

* Rule two: You’re always in the field.

* Rule three: We miss 100 percent of the shots we don’t take.

* Rule four: The only failure is not approaching 

 On Approach Anxiety

* Yes [I still get approach anxiety], the more approach anxiety I developed. This is because people start to know who you are, and expect miracles and no failures. There is only one way to get over it: to approach. Right away. The longer you wait, the more the fear builds. Just accept it as a normal evolutionary response, but also a vestigial holdover fear from a tribal society that no longer really has a purpose.

What should you do when your mind goes blank?

* This is where canned material really becomes useful. Their response gives you a chance relax a bit and catch your bearings. However

When asked about the worst Blowout/Rejection: 

* Funny that you ask that

No one is perfect: everyone has some type of psychological issue:

* Oh, in the world, just about--no one was raised perfectly. But I think the psychological issues in the community are more about men's low self-esteem, and not about negative attitudes towards women. In fact, as I write it, I realize their negative attitude is only toward themselves. So if their experience in the community fixes this, then that's a good thing.

**Socializing in General**

On social isolation from others due to using technology: 

* Every hour i spend socially interacting staring at a screen here probably lowers my comfort with socially interacting IRL. So the burden again is on the individual to make sure their life is in balance. And that becomes more challenging the more great tools people create online.

How to creating a cool social circle and be the leader of the social circle:

* Shortcut: Bring together different people who don't know each other. You become the leader. Good way to cultivate those skills.

On sarging every night to improve: 

* It's funny that guys think it has to be ""every night."" You don't have to go out of your way to do it. If you ever leave your house, in the street, at a gas station/bodega, etc. And it doesn't have to be someone you're attracted to: talk to anyone, just to get used to being social.

On people who are assholes/bitches

* Interesting question, and once I got through it, they turned out to be a great person. I suppose assholes are like bitches: we think someone is like that, but that's only because they somehow threatened our sense of self and self-esteem--and if we see them with empathy, in most cases, we realize they're just as insecure as we are, if not more so.

**Relationship Related**

Moving from friends with benefits to more:

* And here's your answer: people tend to step up when they have a fear of losing something. So if he sees a guy is interested in you

On how to deal with a person who “is not looking for a relationship at this time”: 

* One step at a time. Attraction first, then see what happens. Even when someone isn't looking for a relationship, love can catch them unaware and they'll then want to be in one. That said, get to know her first, who she really is, and make sure you really WANT to be in relationship with her. Big mistake is when anyone gets into a relationship too quickly, is not compatible

On wanting something that you can’t/don't have:

* Isn't that so true: people don't appreciate it while they have it, and then change your mind again or have doubts again, that's not fair to her.

Text her e-card memes.  Ask her what she's doing right now.  Ask her what she's wearing right now

**Compatibility**

Really pay attention to the following words. The majority of failed relationships could have been avoided if they took this advice...

At some point

* Do you want kids? How many?
* Where do you want to live? A house in the suburbs? Out in the country? An apartment in midtown Manhattan?
* Is religion important to you? Do you want your children growing up with a certain religion? Are you dead-set on an atheist upbringing or would you be open to adapting to your partner's faith?
* How do you envision family life working? Is being close with your parents and relatives important to you?
* Do you prefer to live for the now and save later? Or save for retirement now?
* Are you looking for an open relationship where you can date other women? How do you envision that working?
* Do you want to travel the world? Do you enjoy traveling?

Think about these questions INDEPENDENTLY of the girls you are seeing. It might be wise to think about these when you are completely single and unattached. Hell

Once you have a good idea of what YOU want out of life, you'll start to notice red flags. That's OK, tell her you want to keep it casual, and if she's open to it, keep enjoying her company on a more casual basis. You are a man of values and you must STICK to those values or they are meaningless.

Compromise is important

---

**Commitment**

So you've met a great girl, and you've clicked in the bedroom. You think she might be girlfriend or wife material. Congratulations, that's amazing! Now what?

**A lot of romantic-comedies would have you think you need to stand out in the rain with a bouquet of flowers and ask her to be your girlfriend. Don't do that.**

Do you find yourselves just *assuming* that you are hanging out together on Saturday night? Is that becoming a regular thing? Are you guys becoming increasingly comfortable around one another? Are you getting lazier about tidying up your bathroom before you go see her?

**Keeping Her in Love with You**

This is where the fun really begins. You two can grow together

It is absolutely critical to NEVER forget why she fell for you in the first place. Go back and re-read [Part 1: Primer On Who You Will Become](http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/11piau/above_the_game_part_1_primer_on_who_you_will/) and the [Primer on Being a Modern Alpha Male](http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/fobhj/lesson_1_primer_on_being_a_modern_alpha_male/). **You were able to land this amazing woman because you've embodied all those characteristics! Don't fall into the classic trap of forgetting all you've learned just because you have easy access to sex!**

She fell in love with you because:

* *You are a leader.* You take her by the hand and decide how things will be. In the early stage of the relationship, just don't ever give up control entirely. **Women lose respect for men who can't lead.** However, she will naturally try to take ownership of certain parts of the relationship. If she feels like her input isn't valued, her emotions will drift elsewhere. Pick your battles; let her take the lead on things from time to time.

* *You have firm values.* When she does something shitty

* *You make her feel valued and appreciated.* When she does something adorable that makes you feel warm inside

* *You make her feel desired and beautiful.* Never stop seducing your woman. Grab her and rip her clothes off spontaneously. Compliments on her physical beauty are MUCH sexier when they aren't just words. Show her she's beautiful with your actions!

* *You are fun and spontaneous.* Remember all those great date ideas you have? Bust 'em out! Send her mysterious invitations and take her on magic carpet rides. **Your life is awesome and you're letting her ride shotgun in it.** Don't take that offer lightly.

* *You are on a journey towards greatness.* You were in the middle of your self-development journey when you met her. Whether or not you realized it

**Emotions**

Don't be an emotionless shell

You know how you love a good blowjob? Imagine you got a blowjob every time you took out the trash. I bet you'd be a lot happier about trash day!

For women, but not all at once.

Once she feels like she completely understands you

**Jealousy**

Jealousy stems from a fear of loss: A loss of power. A loss of companionship. A loss of control.

Jealousy is borne from a scarcity mindset. One of the key reasons it is so critical to keep working on yourself - to stay on your journey towards greatness - is so you never feel like you've lost your ability to seduce women. Really honestly KNOWING that you have the ability to secure another mate just as good as your current one will help keep you from ever feeling jealous.

That being said

I've heard this from so many women: *""There is nothing hotter than knowing he's the one who's taking me home at the end of the night.""*

You're a secure, men.

Then laugh about it in the car-ride home before you fuck her silly. The rush of emotions she'll experience will drive her mad!

NOTE: this is obviously all done playfully (hopefully she's not actually a heroine addict...)

Here's what it is/ how it works:

- she says something weird/stupid
- you say ""are you on drugs or something!? Needle drugs?""
- you hold her arms out straight
- she'll respond saying ""haha no I'm not on drugs"" (or something like that)
- you say
- stare seductively into her eyes to build tension
- note: still be holding her arms
- then you say ""yep
- hold eye contact...
- then go from there


This does a bunch of different things: its fun/funny, the fact that her palms get turned face up is a signal of submission (which makes you seem dominate = alpha), the eye contact mixed with kino builds sexual tension, the last part about saying ""she's on drugs or turned on"" turns things sexual.

1325795611.0,o4e9k,[FR] Hookup on Plane Flight,EricDisco,555,113,111,"**At the Terminal

I decided to visit my friend in L.A. for five days over new years. We’re planning to chill out and work on some music. I’m at the airport terminal. I arrive about an hour early. I’m sitting there working on my laptop. This girl walks over and sits in one of the seat across from me. Really hot. Young

I consider talking to her. But there’s nowhere to sit near her. And I’m like fuck it

They finally start calling our flight. I get into the line behind a different not-so-cute chick. I ask her if they called my zone

We start getting on the plane. Cute 22 year old redhead is a few people in front of me walking through the dock. 

**On the Plane

On the plane I get to my seat. The gods are smiling down upon me. It turns out the hot young redhead is sitting next to me. I’m in the window seat. She’s in the middle. There’s this asian dude on her left with headphones on looking at photos on his camera.

As I sit down I tell her

Then I realize I forgot my headphones in my bag which is stowed away. God dammit. Oh well, I forgot my headphones in my bag. Guess this is gonna be a boring flight.” 

She’s looking at her kindle and I ask her what book she’s reading. We talk about books a bit.  The flight attendant comes by and tells her to shut off her kindle. She gets all flustered. I say

As the plane takes off we start to talk. We start to get more personal. She tells me her boyfriend of one year just dumped her a few weeks ago. I ask a few questions but then change the subject. We keep talking and talking. 

About a half hour later she asks what my name is. 

**The Conversation Gets Sexual**

I’m not as sexual with this girl as I usually am with most girls I start talking to. I’m making friendly conversation

But then I start testing the waters because this girl is really

Eventually

I start with non-sexual questions. What would you be if you knew you couldn’t fail? Boring stuff. 

Then it gets more sexual. 

I ask her about her first kiss. Then the craziest place she ever had sex. We’re exchanging sexual stories.

I let my hand drop on the seat in between us so that it’s touching her outer thigh.

She asks me what my sexual fantasy is. I tell her we’re at a beach party with a bonfire

The dude next to her is asleep with his headphones on. 

Eventually

Huh

Then I ask

She says no.

I say

She says no.

**Making Out Starts**

There is so much sexual energy

I turn and move my head closer to hers. She moves her head toward me. We start making out. We’re all over each other. We stop every once in a while to see if anyone is looking

Her coat is covering her lap. I’m playing Russian hands and Roman fingers under her coat. She’s getting turned on like crazy. Soon my hands are in her pants and I’m fingering her. She’s lets out a muted moan every time I stick my finger deeper inside her.

Finally we talk about going to the bathroom to fuck. We decide to go check out the situation. We wake up the asian guy and he gets up to let us out into the aisle. We probably look guilty as hell. I couldn’t care less

But there’s no way we’re gonna get into the bathroom together. There’s stewardesses right by the doors and they make the next person in line wait four rows back before the bathroom is free.

**Time to Reel it Back In**

We each use the restroom separately and go back to our seats. At this point

I playfully tell her she needs to calm down and get control of herself. This doesn’t stop us from fooling around some more. But eventually I grow tired of this. There’s only so much you can do without fucking.

So we end up playing scrabble on her Kindle fire for the rest of the flight. It’s pretty chill. I make up a rule that we need to come up with a dirty sentence for each scrabble word we spell. I’m talking dirty to her the whole time, “I’m gonna make you beg like the naughty girl you are.”

The plane eventually touches down. Both of us are tired and drained. Not a whole lot to say but we talk here and there as we walk through the terminal together. I tell her we should meet up while I’m in town. She says let’s hang out on Thursday. We exchange numbers. I leave her at the baggage claim and take off to meet up with my friend who is picking me up.

Conversation Threading is essentially the ability to make a free-flowing conversation. If someone gives you a thread like ""I went to Paris last summer to Study at the local university, which school they went to, what they study, or you could shift the focus of the conversation, you could respond with ""Really? I went to Paris last year,"" or ""I like to travel, as well""  [Which is a great way to build rapport through shared experiences!]

Even if she's giving you tiny bits of information, you could shift the focus again [Me too, I'm taking (subject), isn't it *fascinating* how...], you could drop a cold-read, you could pace her hypnotically [Have you ever noticed how we're both here, outside this coffee shop

**Now lets go deeper**

You can combine the technique I just gave you with other techniques. In particular, gas is too expensive] to warm conversation [Feelings, emotions. Things ""from us"" rather than about us].

What if she tells you she is an emergency room nurse? Well,""  is an example that comes to mind, I'm trusting you to come up with your own.

*It is my personal opinion to avoid ""negative"" emotions, panic, and the like. Sometimes I see people, who mean well, ask people ""Wow that must be so busy,"" or ""You must feel really stressed,"" and the person they're talking to sigh

**Wide Rapport**

So now you're having an interesting conversation that's enticing the emotions. Here's some advice:  Talk about a wide range of topics. At first glance, than to talk about a wide range of topics, but actually a ""wide rapport"" will help you. Thread into multiple directions, talk about multiple topics, and you both will feel like you've connected on multiple levels.  

**How to Master Conversation Threading**

Here's some homework, or whatever the fuck you want).  Pick something girls say that you hear often, if you meet a lot of girls that are Psychologists, write ""Psychologist"" in the center of a paper, and circle it.

Then branch it out. Draw a line to smaller circle

What emotional qualities must a psychologist have?

From the center circle labled Psychologist, correct?]

Of course

This will help you in your sarges,  and branch it out into many different directions.

If nothing else this experience gave me a glimpse into what it's like to be a girl who has AFC's hitting on her and how that would color her response and receptiveness to any new person approaching her.  On to the story. 

About a month ago I started frequenting a bar on my way home from work.  I like the bartender and the vibe is really laid back.  I'd estimate I've stopped in about 3 times a week for the last month.  I realized pretty quickly who the regulars were and ended up becoming friends/acquaintances with several of them.  It's a diverse crowd. They span from 60 year old men to 21 year old girls.  In keeping with the whole idea of self improvement I made an effort to talk to everyone.  In the past I might have just talked to certain people who I thought were in my age range and generally my type.  By talking to everyone and essentially treating them all the same, and fun.  There was no effort involved.  I was having fun and by extension became a fun person to be around.  

Several of the girls I met there became flirty with me at one point or another.  Depending on my mood sometimes I'd flirt back and other times I wouldn't.  Like I said I was mostly just enjoying the dynamic I described above and didn't have any strong interest in any of these girls.  It was just a fun place to unwind after work.

One day one of these girls (Let's call her K) was there with her friend.  She introduced me and we hung out for a few hours.  They said they were going to a bar down the street and asked me to come along.  I told them I should probably go home but they insisted so I went.  When we get there K completely ignores her friend and just talks to me to the point that it felt awkward. K is very flirty and makes a couple of pointed comments and sexual jokes.  I didn't respond to or reciprocate any of it.  I liked hanging out with her but I wasn't interested in her.  I figured she'd get the clue. I finished my drink and said goodnight.  

The next week I'm back at the after work bar.  K is there among many other regulars and general clientele.  We say hi and chat.  I tell her I'm heading out soon and she says she is too.  She's going to meet her friend at the other bar just like last week.  She asks me to come.  I could use one more drink so I go.  On the walk over she tells me I must not be too smart because I'm not picking up on the fact that she's been hitting on me.  I tell her I have picked up on it but that I'm seeing someone.  She seems cool with it.

We get to the next bar and have a drink with her friend.  I'm talking to her friend and K is sitting with her arms crossed, but I don't like what you said earlier.""  I said you mean that I'm seeing someone? Are you kidding? At this point she started ranting the most insane shit I've ever heard.  She starts calling me an asshole and says ""if that was the case you should have shut me down the second I started talking to you.""  She looks at her friend and says ""he knew I liked him.  why would he do this to me?""  Her voice gets louder and louder until she's basically yelling.  She looks at me and says ""I think you better finish your drink and leave.""  I say I'll leave when I'm ready.  ""No. Get the fuck out now!  Get the fuck out!!!!""  When she realizes I'm not leaving she storms off and leaves her friend there.  It was like she turned into a completely different person the second I told her I was seeing someone. 


I'm basically in shock.  I end up having a good conversation with her friend until about a half hour later when K comes back.  I thought she might have had the chance to calm down and was going to apologize.  Nope.  She looks at her friend and says ""What the fuck is he still doing here?""  I tell her I honestly don't understand why she's so upset.  Again she looks at her friend and says ""is he serious?  HE FOLLOWS ME TO BARS and now he won't leave?  he's crazy!!!""  Her friend was visibly embarrassed.  At this point I had enough and left.  

I left feeling really pissed off.  Not because of the rant itself but because I felt like for a month I had been interacting with people from a grounded

I'll focus on the key details

*Setting: My cousin's wedding ceremony and reception at a local vineyard and winery.*

I hadn't seen this cousin of mine in years

At the wedding

Cue HB Tulip Tattoo and HB Wavy Blonde.  Tulip and Blonde were two lovely bridesmaids who appeared to be close friends

I waste no time in initiating kino.  Tulip is wearing a halter top dress so her tattoo is clearly visible.  I kino her by lightly clasping her shoulder and turning her around so I can see the rest of it.  I make a crack about her obvious love for pain and the two girls giggle up a storm.  I kino Blonde simply by walking in a circle around her and drawing a line around her shoulders with my finger as I talk.  I keep her mind baffled with my words and movement

I move the girls around the party, and touch with purpose.  Always be escalating your kino and assume she is comfortable with it.  If you're comfortable, she's comfortable.**

I bust on the girls, and they won't be able to stop thinking about it.**

I end up getting pulled away from them for various reasons throughout the night -- someone wants to introduce me to someone else, one girl or the other finds her way back to me.  I'm attentive and present when I have the time, but there are other things going on that occasionally demand my attention.  **Women are not the most important things in your life.

When the wedding is done

Some of the stuff belongs to Tulip and Blonde

Here's the important thing: these girls knew and trusted each other already

Tulip is rubbing her shoulder as we bring the last of the stuff in, and I begin rubbing her shoulders.  Blonde is trying to hide her smile and pretend to look busy, but I invite her over to help me.  I tell her to rub Tulip's hands, and I give her instructions on how to do it (**be the source of information**).  ""Listen to the sound she makes while you massage,"" I say. ""If it sounds like she's home alone with her favourite toy, then you're at the right spot.""  Blonde's face goes completely red, and Tulip is giggling.  Keep the sexual tension present during the massage.  Let it escalate with each step.

I begin working under Tulip's shirt so I can get the muscles properly.  She's not resisting.

Eventually, while I'm working on Blonde, Tulip turns and begins working on Blonde as well.  Blonde is lying on her stomach with Tulip and I working on her, and she's stroking my leg in gratitude.  Tulip and I are leaning into each other and rubbing Blonde's lower back, and we kiss.  Our massage becomes just a little slower, and we focus on the kissing.  Suddenly, Tulip moans during a kiss

Went out to a nightclub with my buddy Charlie.  Good nightclub, and they play the music at a volume that still leaves it possible to have actual conversations if you can project your voice decently.

Char and I are walking around, palm at 90 degrees, and waves at rapid speed.  He DOES NOT STOP until she smiles or…smiles).

The girl Charlie was making eye contact with smiles and waves back.  She pauses in her walking about two feet from Charlie and Charlie immediately gives her a big bear hug.

They start talking

**Me:** Do you dance?

**Her:** What?

**Me:** Come here.

I reach out and grab her hand

[**Breakdown**: I do this for two reasons.  First, if you have a fit body, it gets her groping you in a way that isn’t overtly showy but she will definitely take note of it and can even get turned on by it.]

Then I spin out, and now she’s laughing and smiling.

**Me:** You’re a TERRIBLE dancer!!  [said with a big grin on my face]

**Her:** It’s not my fault!  I have giant heels on right now.

**Me:** Oh I see

(Out of the blue

**Me:** I’ll just do all the work for both of us then!  I’ll dance for me and I’ll pick you up and dance for you

[**Breakdown**: Here I start teasing her by calling her a terrible dancer.  If you spend an entire interaction being nothing but complimentary

I put her down

**Me**: Have you been smoking??

**Her**: Wow

**Me**: Oh my god

**Her**: Umm

**Me**: [putting my hands on her shoulders in mock indignation]  What about our baby!  I can’t believe you would do this to our child!  That’s it, I want a divorce!

**Her**: haha

**Me**: You can keep my stuff

At this point I throw my one arm around her shoulders and turn to talk to Charlie and the other two girls.

[**Breakdown**:Again I’m pushing her away verbally and being affectionate physically

**Girl #3 who hasn’t been talking to Charlie or I**: Wait so how do you know these guys?

**Me**: [Italian] is my ex-wife

Talk for a minute, she starts laughing, and then I put her down facing me with her back to the group, and my arms are around her waist.

We’re looking at each other

[**Breakdown**: This all happened in just a few minutes.  The kiss was there because there was no physical barrier between us.  I had already spun her, I had my arms around her.  At this point we were so close physically, even while talking our faces were inches apart, and the kiss was an easy transition.  [Touching early and often, and outlandishly in over the top ways at times, makes the kiss into a small event.](http://www.kickassacademy.com/how-to-kiss-a-girl-for-the-first-time/) ]

**How we end up leaving together:** I start pulling her hair and pushing things forward physically.  I’m alternating between dirty talk (saying I can tell she’s a freak in bed

After a bit of this I’m super turned on and I know she is too, and start walking towards the exit.  She says she has to say goodbye to her friends, runs back to tell them she’s leaving, and we walk out to go to my apartment. 

**Endnote**: A lot of this stuff may seem like it’s all well thought out and pre-meditated, and I should touch her on her lower back because it's more sensual than her shoulder"".  You can’t possibly be thinking about all of these variables at the same time (or at least I can’t, my head would explode).

**EDIT FOR SOME CONTEXT:** all this was written as a suggested approach for somebody who was dared to get laid within 2 weeks. I should have stressed this more, taking dishonest 'shortcuts' to interesting hobbies - would be pretty screwed up if you make all this your general lifestyle. Don't. Specifically, this text is a reply to this question:

&gt;If I don't get laid by February 1st

TL;DR: a beginner's guide to getting laid within a short time frame

---
Getting laid within the course of a couple of weeks should be doable, and are reasonably good-looking (i.e. not fat, no acne, lenses rather than glasses if you, can though it's not *that* important).

Do those apply to you? Ok

**Prep work**

* If you don't yet, actually it's a plus because it makes for great socializing and isolating, but ok, no point in starting to smoke just for 2 weeks.
* Start wearing blue jeans, but if you have stubble, shave leave it on (i.e. shave electronically). If this is totally not your style, great, if someone asks say some random dude gave it as style advice and fuck it, you're giving it a shot for 2 weeks! This kind of 'fuck it, just having some fun, so might as well start here.
* Have fun starting conversations with random strangers everywhere, YOU'RE HAVING A GREAT TIME FOR THE BET. Read stuff like [this](http://www.happiness-project.com/happiness_project/2009/05/seven-tips-for-making-good-conversation-with-a-stranger/) if you need inspiration. Ok, sorry, that link sucks, talk about *light-hearted* stuff first and foremost.
* If you play guitar, watch 2 guitar tutorials on Youtube, and get used to it: you are now officially 'learning guitar'. Borrow a guitar from a friend for 2 weeks for bonus points. 
* Same goes for 'travel' and 'being international': recall your last greatest travels, if not, read some language learning sites on it and get used to it you are now officially 'learning proper French/Spanish because you love travel and connecting with the locals makes it so much better'.
* Have scented candles and some bottles of red wine (however cheap) stashed at your place. When you get a girl home, see below). Red wine is great because it tastes good after both a night of drinking beer, wine, or cocktails.
* Go buy condoms and make sure to have them somewhere near your bed. If you are inexperienced in sex, and it's not an easy task. *Especially* because ideally you put it on while you are kissing her to keep her in the mood.

Ok, and you are prepared for the logistics, we'll have you going on 2 fronts to meet those girls: during the day, classes etc etc... and on dead moments, you want to be on okcupid. During the evening, you want to be out getting drunk together with other people. In the late afternoon, you send out texts and call girls you met before.

**Dating site**

Do all of this RIGHT NOW after reading my comment.

* Create a girl profile on okcupid.com, create a guy profile, copy it, and change whatever needed to make it apply to you. For your profile picture, you want your face turned 3/4 (jawline!), and smiling. For your 'secondary' pictures, you want either pictures where you have fun with friends, or pictures were you are wearing some kind of gimmicky clothing (dressed like a banana or whatever).
* Start answering okcupid.com questions to kill time, they will make you appear in people's news feeds.
* Still to kill time, something funny, something with a smiley, AND NO QUESTION.
* If they answer (and they surprisingly often will, and the second *But, how about we skip the okcupid message ping pong and meet up? Hell, how about this weekend even for all I care, I've been looking to check out this place zzz.

Anyway, perhaps you can get me yours? More practical to arrange things that way)*

Ok

* Have a bottle of red wine at your place
* Go to a nice pub that's not to silent and not to loud
* The 'interacting with the girls' bit from below very much applies on dates also.
* After an hour or 3 drinks, that is WORSE than the first one! While there, proceed to drinking, teasing and touching and the 'end game' (see below).

**Nightlife**

Ok

* Do you drink a lot? No? Sorry, and join them in the drinking, laughing, and of course, talking to, and joking around with, random people all the time. You want to be drinking with somebody at least 5 times per week from now on. Going out together with a group of friends is ok, but if you don't have anybody GO TO A CONCERT SOMEWHERE ON YOUR OWN. Build resistance

**Interacting with the girls**

Ok, or after a while in the online tdate or WHEREVER, do the following things EARLY and OFTEN, constantly reminding yourself that you should be doing them or moving towards doing them:

* **Be separate from the group**: stand so that it's just you 2
* **Tease her**: when she says something slightly silly say 'ok. You're drunk, whatever you can come up with to jokingly make fun of her. You want to aim for her playfully hitting your shoulder and her jaw dropping in shock (but with a smile in her eyes) as soon as possible.
* **touch her**: shake hands or give a kiss on the check while touching her upper arm when first introduced, put your hand on her shoulder and look her deep in the eyes while speaking with a playfully stern voice. When moving trough a crowd together, grab her hand. Or gently guide her by her waist. Stuff like that.
* **Be interesting**: talk about your guitar

Don't be scared if you are not 'a natural'

**Closing it up**

KEEP GETTING HER DRINKS (or saying it's your turn or whatever) TROUGHOUT ALL THIS. Don't be a cheapo, that's putting her on a pedestal and she'll think you're a loser. But while you are in a friendly conversation, getting drinks for the both of you is NOT a bad thing, contrary what you hear here. Also, even if you gave the previous 'round', don't be scared to also offer the next! If this is during a nice date or chat and she is cool, 99% of the cases she will say 'oh yes, I'll go get them'. 

If you are with a girl doesn't like to drink alcohol, MOVE ON. She is the type that doesn't like to 'let go', and it's very likely she won't like to have sex with people after only one date / right after meeting, either. Not good for your sex-by-february plan.

(unless she does not drink

At this point a warning: I emphasize drinking so much for your get-laid-soon plan, because sex with a girl like that is NO FUN if not impossible, and, frankly, it's also rape. Don't do that. 

Anyway, wondering **where/when to kiss her**, right? The answer is, either at the party/date if you manage to get both of you a bit 'isolated', but if that fails *while walking back to your place*. While walking, playfully extern your arm so she can hold it in a 'lady' manner (and of course, be touching and get close to you and appreciate your 'joking gentleman' style), but at one point when you're both really laughing hard at something

Then, but this time have *her* on the side of the wall, and rub all over her back and side while kissing. Pinning her against the wall like that is kinda 'dominant' which tends to turn girls on. More advanced but even more turn-on is to hold her wrists while kissing, and/or putting them over her head. But ok, that's nice but not needed, as long as you kiss her before you get to your place. Having er at your place and *then* kissing sucks, because if she doesn't kiss you back it's extremely awkward and you'll be far more devastated when she leaves.

**At your place**

At your place, except for short quips in between the kissing, or if you are really good at light-hearted jokingly talking (and you should be, if only from talking to all those strangers all the time), open that bottle of wine and poor drinks, but make sure to not forget to get back to the making out. 

When making out / kissing: be soft, etc etc... In short, keep moving forward, but be prepared to do it SLOWLY, even taking one step back if she protests, but always keeping the touching and kissing going. If she wants to take things fast you'll notice, no worries. **The secret to being a good kisser** is to do it like the movies by the way: don't shove your tongue in there and start twirling it around - and you WILL be inclined to do it like that when drunk - but rather go in slow, 3 second kisses with your tongue just barely inside her

In case you wonder, over her clothes*. Doing it just over her  panties if she wears a skirt is the best scenario, but even if she wears jeans this works wonders on just about every girl, it's really quite shocking to notice the first time you get to do this. Clits are a wonderful invention, and, praise yourself lucky, we live in times where every guy can find out EXACTLY where it is from watching online porn. Believe me, guys not knowing where it is was a common joke between girls

If you are eventually about to have sex and putting on a condom and struggling with it, condoms really hate me' or something and keep trying, including trying with a new one if you put yours on inside-out accidentally.

Unfortunately you didn't choose the ideal moment for your bet, more willing to have parties and adventures etc...).

The answer in the first case could be: ""Wow, but that's as far as I planned ahead. Shit.""

I called this ""embrace the truth""

Embarrassment, self-consciousness... these are INTRINSIC HUMAN EMOTIONS. If you do not have them, you are a sociopath. If someone tells you they don't have them, they are almost certainly a liar, and if not, they are almost certainly a sociopath themselves.

You've heard it in all the war movies, ""bravery is about what you do when you're scared, not when you don't have any fear.""

The difference between a man who can successfully ""not give a fuck"" and one who lives in fear of approaching women is that the latter guy isn't just embarrassed or afraid... he is embarrassed and afraid to be embarrassed and afraid. ""Not giving a fuck"" is about recognizing and accepting how ridiculous you are; that you're this goofy creature who does stupid things.

Those asshole PUAs with their greasy slicked back hair, but they've learned to hide it.

Those great guys who everybody likes, or running out of things to say, or stammering and being a goof is a perfectly natural thing to happen.

Being ""alpha"" is about accepting this kind of stuff happens, everyone else walking around - ladies man or lady - is just as much a bizarrely evolved super-ape as you are. In their heads, the same shit is going on to a lesser or greater extent.

In order to successfully ""not give a fuck"", that makes them the fool, not you.

Any situation that a ""loser"" finds themselves in can be turned into a ""win"" by just demonstrating that being thought of as a loser is irrelevant to your sense of self-value.

It's not the most pressing of issues


I've been working as a barmaid since November


From my position behind the bar I like to people watch, and with the guys I like I try and give them a little helping hand.



If a pretty girl comes up to the bar I'll strike up conversation with her as I'm getting her drink, I'll greet him like he's the coolest guy in the whole room, start a little banter with him and let him look like the funny guy who the staff all love. I'll ask the girl ""oh, have you met David..?"" and make some introductions that David can develop into a conversation. It's an easy little opener that gives him a way to talk to her and it's worked a few times, but I feel like I could be doing something a bit more subtle and creative!



I've debated sending drinks over to pretty girls in the past and saying ""that's from the guy in the blue"" but I know a lot of guys think buying girls drinks is a bad move!


I know a lot of you guys would probably prefer doing all the work yourself

1371829596.0,1gsssh,Mystery vs. Intrigue,bl1y,534,110,39,"It’s a rather common — and mistaken — belief that building an air of mystery around yourself will make you more attractive. And it’s easy enough to see how that belief might develop. We know the trope from film and television and Jane Austen novels: a stranger comes to town, and in the course of learning about our mysterious stranger she falls madly in love with him. Who wouldn’t want to be able to produce that pattern on demand?

The problem is that mystery isn’t the right quality to be building. Guys will hear they’re supposed to be mysterious and immediately they begin withholding every bit of information about themselves. They don’t give their real names

If done extremely well, like you have something to hide. And since this isn’t a court of law, your silence can be interpreted as evidence against you. Not to mention you can become very annoying very quickly. It’s a bit like trying to have a conversation with someone who answers every question with a question — not really a turn on.

What you should be trying to cultivate rather than mystery is intrigue. The difference is that mystery is about never letting her see behind the curtain

There’s a saying that the sexiest part of a woman’s body is whatever part it kept just out of view. It’s the next inch above the bottom of a skirt, she can’t remain a fully clothed mystery forever.

**Move Slowly**

For many recovering average frustrated chumps, telling her you aced the SAT isn’t going to suddenly get her back. But if she is interested, laying all your cards on the table makes the rest of your interactions dull. Part of what makes relationships fun is the exploration, and yanking the curtain wide open puts an immediate end to that.

Hold some cards back. If you’re an excellent cook

You also want to speak less. I don’t mean during the approach or when you’ve only been in set for a couple minutes. At that point you really do have to carry the conversation. I mean later on in the interaction, and give her the mental space necessary to wonder what you’re thinking.

**Be Surprising**

If you keep going on the same kinds of dates over and over, invite her to go hiking, or go to the zoo, or to Color Me Mine and paint coffee mugs. Not only is it just fun to have a change of pace, but she’ll realize that there’s a whole other side to you that she didn’t know about before. She’ll want to explore that territory. She’ll also begin to feel excitement as she anticipates what the next surprise will be. That’s free intrigue right there! You haven’t even done the next surprising thing yet.

This is also why you have to hold some cards back. If you use all your good moves up front then you don’t have any moves left.

**Have Something Behind The Curtain Worth Revealing**

This is the tough part. It’s easy to build suspense and keep her on her toes, she wants to know how you got to be such a good cook and what else you’re capable of doing.

So what can you do to put some good stuff behind the curtain? All the obvious things you’d think of if you tried to answer the question for yourself.

Read more, memoirs, popular science, whatever you find interesting.

Work on a creative hobby. Yeah, don’t be content with your current skill level. If you like cooking, start reading Cooks Country to really understand the craft better. Whatever it is, take it seriously.

Get out of the house and go do something. Go to an art museum, or a concert, or a baseball game. Sitting at home watching ESPN doesn’t count. That’s not an experience. Sitting at the stadium is an experience, something you can talk about doing. Even if the girl isn’t in to baseball, she will find it interesting that you go out and experience life. That’s an increasingly rare trait these days. If you try to talk about how you sat on the couch watching the NBA finals you’re likely to bore her to sleep (with someone else).

Lastly, there’s nothing intriguing about a lifeless sack of raw dough. Someone who is in shape though? It encourages speculation about how you do it, and gives off the general impression of living an active, exciting life, even if your exercise routine is itself boring.

And that right there is really the key to building intrigue. Have something intriguing

1361431073.0,18xycb,Pickup Principle: The Signal of Opportunity (with a mini FR),HumanSockPuppet,512,85,54,"I read a lot of field reports here on seddit

**Take a moment and ask yourself if you've ever been in this situation:** you meet a girl in public and open her (maybe at a bookstore or a grocery market). She smiles and doesn't say much, no nervous movements, no lip biting, nothing.

*The thing is, and not putting any more or less distance between you.  That right there is a signal of interest, and it is a behaviour I've come to call the **Signal of Opportunity.**

When you're still a novice at pickup, but I think there's a lot of value in being able to quickly read, recognize, and internalize the signals women use to communicate interest. Assuming attraction is a useful tool, but only for certain circumstances. When you're a novice, it's good to understand the social landscape.

Well, what humans are doing.

**Here's an example from my life today which illustrates this principle:**

I was out at my favourite running trail earlier this afternoon when I ran past an attractive young brunette who was standing perfectly still in the middle of the trail. I gave her an affirmative nod as I ran past - she smiled ever so slightly and quickly lowered her eyes when we made mutual eye contact. I thought nothing of it and ran on.

A quarter of a mile down the trail, the brunette came blazing past me, only to slow herself to a brisk walk about 10 metres in front of me. And there she remained.

Now

Attractive women get hit on throughout the day. A LOT. And they've develop a lot of tools for filtering guys. Bitch shields

**So if a hot girl spends all of her time shooting down incoming guys who don't have the chops to survive her barrage

That's the Signal of Opportunity.

She's telling you that you're cleared to land, it's a signal to escalate by getting closer or initiating kino.

Remember, etc. So when a girl appears to be standing still longer than would seem normal, odds are there's something interesting nearby. **And odds are, that interesting something is YOU.**

Having recognized the girl's signal of opportunity, and she was laughing after I'd issued my challenge. We ended up racing back together, with me playfully running her off the trail a few times by crowding her space (kino escalation and negging). When we made it back to the parking lot, we made out and exchanged numbers.

Anyway, yet). Meet up with the girl selling it at the mall, to my surprise she's a HB8. We make the exchange and I ease the tension and make her laugh a little. As soon as we shared eye contact and smiles (something I naturally avoid like the plague) I find we both feel comfortable and I have no problem flowing from there. She mentions she's getting rid of it since it was a gift for her ex, and she just ""can't have it around"", I make fun of her for giving up something because of one asshole. I ask if she'd be down to grab a drink, she accepts and we part ways.

We decide what to do over texting. She says she wants to go to a comedy bar. I agree even though I've heard that's a bad idea for a first date. I keep everything short other than a joke about being a craigslist guy. She wants to keep talking with smilies and haha's every text, thank you seddit for making me aware of that. Fuck texting games.

So, this girl is way out of my league anyway, as much as I have to pretend she isn't. I get to the bar 10 minutes earlier than we meet, and it's dead as fuck except for two deadbeet barflies and the bartender. Not my scene at all. I'm anxious as fuck. My instincts told me sit at a table and jack off on my phone until she gets there. But now knowing the importance of how comfortable I appear in the social situation, I decide to sit beside them and shoot the shit. When she walked in I happened to be making them laugh (not difficult, these guys were tanked talking about elton john songs)... she arrives I immediately go over and hug her and joke about my ""new best friends"". 

I grab her a drink, as we laugh with/at them. I give them props as I walk by to the bathroom, etc. The bartender seems to acknowledge me as the not-annoying guy. ""Talk to everybody"" is DEFINITELY solid advice.

When people start coming in, if that will make you comfortable."" I said slightly smug as I move our stuff and lead her over. We're relentlessly the target of their ""crowd work"" in a room of ~30, prodding us to say it's our first date, etc. I even reveal we met on craigslist, when they ask how I just said ""I put up an ad for a dominatrix"" and leaned for her to spank me. Totally out of character for me but I was already riding a high, I knew she loved the attention we were getting. I was determined that I wasn't gonna let these Jonah Hill motherfuckers put me on the spot, and I somehow made it through... It was like a second set of shit tests and she saw I passed. I made a point to look at her for every joke's reaction, eventually she starts squeezing my knee every time she laughs or feels uncomfortable.

I ask her if she wants to take off for a walk in the cold... We walk down the street with my arm around her hip. We grab some hot chocolate and talk about the show. I'm expecting a kiss and a second date

*Tips For attracting the opposite sex through knowledge of human sexuality*

* **Be Confident**
I realize that on this sub

* **Don't try too hard- appear aloof.**
An organism would not survive natural selection if it mated with just anyone. Neurologically

* **Get in shape**
This one is fairly obvious and requires little explanation. In our DNA

* **Wear bright colors
The peacock has a fascinating mating ritual. The female peacock doesn't go for the largest male, wear colors that make you stick out while still dressing modest. The best color to choose is red. It attracts female attention on a subconscious level. It also makes you look healthier given your skin tone. No fucking fedoras guys

* **Speak slowly
This is more psychological than biological. You will come of as over anxious if you speak to fast. Smiling makes you more attractive (in most cases) and if you laugh at her jokes too easily you will come off as desperate. Make her earn your affections

* **Initiate contact**
When we do anything from cuddling and kissing to full on sex

* **Re. Rebounding -When you break up
There is a ton of neurological activity going on in your head when you are with someone that you are in a romantic relationship with, your body goes through a type of withdrawal. You will try and make up for it in another way, which often leads to a sexual encounter with another party. This is some of the science behind rebounding after a relationship.




The theory of the science of attraction is simple. In physics, it is a science, and using the science one should be able to improve there chances of manipulating the outcome of encounters

 On his way to the bar
 
 Three hours later he returned to a lonely home, and alone.
 
 What had gone wrong? He tried putting into play all that he had learned, the eye contact, he felt like a god damned smuck.
 
 The next morning he woke up, ""FUCK IT"" To the world.
 
 Disregarding all he had learned about fashion, stuck a hat backwards on his head, and with a Twisted Sister anthem booming in his mind, embarked into the world.
 
 He walked through the grocery store with intense purpose and a focus akin to a laser beam. He saw an attractive woman - blonde, and after a moment gave a flirty smile. This puzzled our young hero, but he wasn't going to be distracted or slowed. He had some mother fucking chicken to buy. His flip flops smacked the tile with a defying cadence, his arms swung freely at his sides. As he approached the poultry section, he noticed a young brunette walking towards him. She quickly averted eye contact and looked towards the ground. He grabbed a package of chicken breasts, examined the price tag for half a moment, then tossed it on the shelf with casual disapproval. The brunette had noticeably slowed her pace and was playing with her hair. He grabbed another package, and turned around. She glanced at him.
 
 He gave her a nod and a wink. 
 
 * A wink? Who the hell winks?* he heard a voice inside him ask.
 
 *I fucking do. That's who.* and he silently challenged anyone to question it.
 
 She gave a big grin, a new self. He felt strong, certain. He fixated his focus on tapping into this newfound mental state. He felt energy, freedom from judgement. 

 Some muscle head was walking towards him with his girlfriend. He casually looked them both in the eye, but because he fucking felt like it. He scrutinized the boyfriend. What a fucking douche. What a tool. He looked at her. She was cute, he gave her a smile and moved on.
 
 Our young Bruce Willis, his movement were sharp and deliberate. A lovely woman carrying a baby offered to let him go in front of her filled cart. He told her she was sweet while he grabbed a magazine from the shelf and examined its cover. There was silence, a moment of awkwardness. No there wasn't. Not on his watch. He was in control and refused to allow awkwardness. He placed the magazine back and told her said she had a cute baby. Not with a slick grin, not as though it were an ""opener"". He stated it as though he was commenting on the quality of a paint job on a Dodge Charger. As the conversation progressed between the two of them, he didn't lose focus. He gave her every ounce of attention but silently communicated that he was busy, damn it. He had places to be. Her friend joined her. She was beautiful. He asked her name. He wasn't hoping for approval or fretting about whether she liked him, he asked for it like he was asking for a refill on his pepsi. She gave him her name. 

Five minutes of conversation and two phone numbers later, you can't care whether you make new friends. One must not accept fear, and one must not avoid it. A successful man has to blow through it like a fucking freight train and ask for more.

Okay, we’re about to go all freaky on it. Did you read all that bullshit about what the rings actually signify? Disregard. The rings she has on signify whatever her shoes tell you. Period. Don’t be Orson Welles and start to think you actually are psychic. Rings = vehicle. Shoes = personality. Got it? Good. Okay, here’s the script. Personal comments throughout.   

(A Natural lag in conversation has set it

You (formerly me): I see you wear a ring on your (blank) finger(s). Why?

Honey: Yeah

You: Interesting. I once read an incredibly dense book on the fall of the Roman Republic, there were no religions, but rather cults to certain gods. Basically, whatever finger someone wore a ring on symbolized the god they were trying to represent.  

(Take note of exactly what’s happening here. First, intriguing.” AFC’s simply don’t talk like this, and these types of words not only hook her interest, but will also become associated with *you* in her mind for that very reason. Second, will she think you’re a nerd? Hell yeah. Is that a bad thing? Fuck no! You’re displaying an intellectual curiosity and believe it or not, *if you package it right* that shit *is* a turn-on. Finally, I’ve run the routine in front of groups and one on one, meaning you just became an alpha.)

Honey: Really? 

You: Yes. Haven’t you ever thought about it?

You calmly extend your hand

You: Give me your hand

She complies. If she looks hesitant, you’re deep into the sales routine. 

Slowly

You: We all know Henry VIII was the first to put a ring on his lady’s finger. Do you know why he did that?

Honey: Because there’s a vein leading to the heart! (If she says she doesn’t know why

You: Very good! (You just became a teacher) Well, because the ring finger represented the cult of Venus. 

(Now you pause. Assess reaction)

Honey: Hmmm

You: It doesn’t stop there. (touch her pinky now)This was for Mars

(This should really have gotten her attention by now)

You: (taking her thumb) Neptune was granted his own kingdom in the ocean, Jupiter. (then her middle finger) And this is Dionysius, god of partying. His followers found truth in wine and worshiped revelry. 
(pause)

You: You see

(Pause… you’re waiting for something here) 

Honey: So what does that say about me?  (PS

You: Well

Example. Girl wearing flats (see above) with a ring on, and index finger, or Neptune and Jupiter respectively.   

You: So you’re clearly following Neptune, known as the leader of the gods. Because you’re rocking Jupiter, I would guess you’re very sensible. Do your friends usually come to you for advice? (hint: girls talk something like 7 times more than men, with their close friends and loved ones. Some of this is statistically certain to be advice) 

Well, I’d go as far as to say that, given the choice, you value comfort over style, right?

(See if she gets the neg or not) 

Then

(BTW

This is where you’ve got to decide where to go. I’ve literally used this routine to entertain a group of people who watched me # close a gorgeous blonde at a house party, because if you’ve done it right, you’ve created an amazing connection, kino’ed like a mother fucker, and also shown that you’re smart, charming, and super interesting. 

Ah

Item 1. What if she’s not wearing a ring? run the routine exactly as before

You: Not wearing a religious identifier was unheard of in ancient times, meaning he couldn’t be weighed down with such trinkets.  

(Guess what else? Mercury’s expeditious nature also happens to line up perfectly with whatever adjectives her shoes are screaming at you… weird

Item 2. If you’re going to do this routine

Item 3. Why did you change them from Greek to Roman? Because the gods are the same, to avoid detection as we're using a widely publicized cold read. Also, ancient Rome is coo.

Item 4. Yeah that’s it. This is some of my A material

Attraction is the name of the game. Attractive men run businesses and governments, and live successful lives of abundance. Above all else, you want to be attractive.

There are four factors that serve to generate attraction.

---

**1) Authenticity**

A lot has been written about confidence. If you boil it down to its simplest parts

An authentic man is a man who lives a life of honesty to himself and the world. He is in tune with his true values and isn't afraid to show them to others. He stands proverbially naked to the world, he speaks up. When he wants something, he pursues it. An authentic man seeks truth, friendship, love, sex, and beauty. He is unabashed in his pursuits because he lives a life of authenticity. He has absolutely nothing to be ashamed of

An authentic man understands the difference between his ego (socially conditioned limiting beliefs) and his being (his true self). He lives to satisfy his being's true desires. The world is his oyster, but if it's not in the cards, then he shrugs it off, ""It was never meant to be.""

**Ways to demonstrate authenticity:** Speaking honestly and openly. Showcasing strong body language. Utilizing rapport-neutral/breaking vocal tonality.

---

**2) Desire**

Women desire men who desire women. All women, long to be desired. Being desired is a fundamental pleasure that we all enjoy. 

A lot of traditional pickup theory advocates opening indirectly and masking one's intentions. FUCK THAT NOISE. The battle of ""direct versus indirect"" has been fought and direct has won. Indirect opening and masking one's intentions is the primordial ooze that the Friend Zone crawled out of. You desire her

Now what does that mean? Yes, I've realized one thing... All the best seducers can't keep their hands off the women they find attractive. It's as if something primal inside of them compels them to go after what they **desire.**

Women want a man to dominate them in the bedroom. They want the hair at the base of their neck pulled. They want a man to groan in bed with them. They want to be ravished and told how fucking sexy they are. They want to be seduced and FUCKED by a real man.

**Ways to demonstrate desire:** Touch. Direct statements of intent. Strong

---

**3) Excitement**

Women want to be taken on magic carpet rides. Women want adventure in their lives. They want to wake up the morning after meeting a man thinking

Are you leaving an amazing first impression with the women you meet? Are your date ideas better than anyone else's you know? Are you the one deciding what the next move is? Are you a leader of men?

If not, ""So what do you want to do?"" ever again. YOU are a man with a plan. You decide what happens next. Your reality is so strong that she is absorbed into it. You do and say things to her that no one has ever done or said before. You are unique.

**Ways to demonstrate excitement:** Keep a leading frame. Be unique. Use non-sequiturs in conversation. Do random things for the lulz.

---

**4) Lifestyle**

You have eclectic interests and hobbies. You have a job you actually enjoy or are pursuing a career/education that is in touch with your being's true desires. You have interesting friends and go on adventures all the time. 

You have studied fashion and take care to look good. You work out. You make a conscious effort to have the best hygiene possible.

**Ways to demonstrate lifestyle:** Live a great life and people will take notice.

---

**Action Items**

1) Grab your notebook. Look at the notes you made in [Part 1.](http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/11piau/above_the_game_part_1_primer_on_who_you_will/) Analyze them. Are you being entirely honest with yourself? Is there more you could be doing? Did you write down unattainable goals? Write them out again

2) Try to go an entire day without masking your intentions or true feelings. Vocalize how you honestly feel while treating everyone you talk to with respect. Try to catch yourself every time you're being less than 100% honest. Examples:

* *""Oh no

* *""I don't mind that you canceled an hour before our date.""*

* *""Oh yeah

* *""My hobbies are lame

* *""I'm okay being exclusive.""*

3) Continue step #2 for a week

4) Go outside, you are absolutely beautiful. I just had to tell you that."" See? That wasn't so bad, right? Now do it again. And again. After ten approaches, try and initiate a short conversation. Do not let a week go by without telling a beautiful woman that she is beautiful ever again. Don't let your seduction muscles atrophy.

5) Think of a random and fun outing that you doubt many men would ever think of. Once you think something up, I was wondering what you think of this date idea..."" Get their honest opinion on it. If it goes over well, jot it down in your notebook. Repeat this until you have 25 random and fun date ideas. Use these liberally - you are now more exciting than 99% of men.

6) Be honest with yourself... Are you happy with your sense of style and fashion? If you aren't (and you probably aren't!), run it by a handful of well-dressed women. Take their opinions to heart, but with a grain of salt. Jot down what you think you want to look like and go buy yourself a new wardrobe. If you cannot afford to do so, start saving 10% of your income every week until you can. Buy yourself at least ONE great outfit as soon as possible.

7) Tell at least one close friend or family member about your new journey to improve yourself as a man and beg them to pester you about it on a weekly basis.

Approach anxiety is the feeling most of us get when we see a cute girl and think about approaching her. It is usually a tightness in the chest, but acts in spite of them. The AA is accepted rather than resisted. 

Unfortunately

Why is there a failure to escalate? Because of escalation anxiety, fast heart rate, and fear. EA pops its head out when you and your girl have a good vibe going and you think about touching her. Or kissing her. Or pulling her in. Or getting sexual. Or just asking for the number. 

So, where you are talking to a hot girl and having a good conversation and you just don't want to FUCK it up. Anyway, that is choice one. Stay in the nice little comfort zone.

Choice two is to ACT when you feel EA hit. Use EA as a CUE. Not sure when you should try and touch her leg or put your arm around her? When you get the feelings of EA. Do it THEN. The key, remember they signify its time to make a choice. Train yourself to make the right one, make it your catalyst.

Before going on

**Show

The key to demonstrating value (other than having value and believing in yourself) is a concept well known to writers: Show

Telling someone your good traits (awesome job, or how your ex GF was really hot) just makes them think you’re insecure. If you were confident, you wouldn’t feel the need to tell people how great you are. It’s also just not at all convincing. Attraction is a feeling, not a reasoned weighing of the facts.

Showing your value on the other hand, she’ll think you’re funny. Tell her about your awesome friends and she’ll wonder why you aren’t hanging out with them. Show up to the club with your awesome friends and let everyone see you having a good time, and she’ll think you’re a cool, popular guy.

**Social Proof**

Social proof is when you have other people vouch for you being an attractive, but showing. When you go to a bar with a group of friends and you are all joking with each other, have a lot of energy, and are having a good time, that’s social proof. If you were a loser, you wouldn’t be out with a bunch of cool dudes having fun, therefor everyone who sees your group knows you’re not a loser.

Hanging out with women, women will assume you must have something else going for you if you can keep the attention of women.

If you’re sarging solo, and so you end up with negative value. To overcome this, start chatting up people as soon as you arrive. Guys, girls, doesn’t matter. Be friendly to everyone. A girl who sees you talking to a couple guys doesn’t know that you just met them. Now you’ve got social proof.

For sarging solo

**Confidence**

Confidence is a bit of an odd thing because it’s both a demonstration of value and an actual value itself. We like confident people, and never want to go out and have an adventure. But it’s also a way of demonstrating a generalized high value.

People are shit at judging value in a vacuum, but you’re also the world’s foremost expert.

If you act like a beta, people will assume this is because you actually are low value. After all, would a really cool high value guy present himself as a piece of shit loser? Andy Kaufman aside, no way. So if you act like a loser it must be because you are one. Girls won’t waste their time trying to tell if your opinion of yourself is wrong.

It works the same way with being alpha.If you act like you’re an alpha people are very likely to believe you. There’s plenty of reasons to think you’d lie about being alpha

Confidence is also a form of guerrilla social proof. If you approach a girl with confidence and are comfortable talking to her

Getting confidence is the trick though, just give yourself a little bit of positive self-talk, take a deep breath, jump in and remember that simply acting confident gives you some value. The ability to approach a stranger is a rare and admirable trait, so at a bare minimum you have that going for you.

**Dancing Monkey Syndrome**

You just delivered your opener perfectly, and then you did a couple magic tricks and the set is completely blown away. Too bad you’ve about to be blown out.

You’ve contracted Dancing Monkey Syndrome. You’re telling the set you opened that you’re there to entertain them. You might be entertaining

Dancing Monkey Syndrome is also incredibly impersonal. You can tell the same jokes the exact same way to someone completely different than the girl you’re talking to, there’s always comedy specials on HBO.

**When Showing Isn’t an Option**

Show, odds are the bar kitchen isn’t going to invite you back to show off your skills, and while you can show wealth by spending freely that tends to come across as try-hard and actually pretty insecure about all your other traits. So what does that leave? Telling. Fortunately, there are a couple tricks to make telling your good qualities a lot more effective.

I love to cook, often in really surprising ways, like how a really simple peach glaze takes on a complex, three dimensional flavor when you add just a little bit of dijon mustard. Every time you have one of those little moments where you see a new way of combining ingredients that experience goes into this sort of mental file cabinet that you can draw from in the future, so you’re not just transforming the food — you’re transforming the way you see and think about food. Plus, you know, there’s also the food itself

Reading that

Emotion. Enthusiasm. Passion. Whatever you want to call it

You also want to work in some details. They make the mental images you’re creating much more vivid and lend some credibility. If you enjoy cooking like I do

Finally, zest for life is itself a value. People who can talk about things in an exciting way make us feel excited, we want to be around those people more if for nothing than the energy they bring with them.

1364875570.0,1bht2b,"[FR] Asked HB8.5 out whom i've known for years, brought her to the bars, took her home, f-close",ronmagicjohnson,106
I've recently had a bad case of oneitis which has had me really stressed out


I passively invited her (I'll call her Jamie) to come to my friend's birthday gathering at a bar.  Jamie is a girl I've known for going on five years.  We liked each other way back


Anyway,"" instead of ""you should come"" because I had read on this seddit that could is more effective than should. She says she might come, I give her the details and don't respond to her ""ok sounds good"" text.  An hour later she texts me saying she's in, and asking for my friend's address and whatnot.  I kept texting to a minimum, this was a new strategy for me and it worked out beautifully.


She arrives at my friend's house and we are watching the NCAA tournament and pregaming the bar.  We are there for about an hour and a half, I kept Kino to a minimum because I figured I could escalate later at the bar and it might be weird to be touchy with a small group.  However, while we talked I held eye contact with her and smiled a lot, but had a laid back attitude and kept things positive.  If you haven't read the article on powergame and the various posts posts on keeping things positive, I recommend you do so. If I and a woman I am trying to seduce were talking about something I didn't find particularly interesting, I would put it down in a joking manner and attempt to change the subject.  This would sometimes work, but often times it would offend the woman.  The evening of this encounter, hockey is not my favorite sport and one I know little about


 I think it's important to share these details because a lot of people come to this site expecting a script of exactly what to say to get laid.  That is unrealistic, both of you will enjoy yourselves.  She knew I wasn't knowledgeable on hockey, but was seemingly impressed by my willingness to discuss something that wasn't in my wheelhouse and ability to make it fun for both of us.  In short, stay positive and make things interesting and relatable for yourself.


After pregaming, and it is clear that he'll soon be kicked out by a bouncer. Internally, I panic because I thought there'd be a lot of girls in the bigger group me were meeting up with (there were none), and becaues there is more pressure on me to entertain Jamie and my friend we were with.  To calm my nerves and counteract the my drunken friend, I suggest we ditch him to get a drink and explore.  Jamie agrees and we venture off.  The important thing to take away from this is an Alpha  recognizes a shitty situation, creates a new plan of action and is seemingly unaffected by things not going as planned.  A failed plan should be viewed as an opportunity to create and do something better.


When we get to the bar, it means she's interested and it is implied that you are going to return the favor later on.  Insisting that you buy the round or pay for your own drink comes off as desperate and eager to please.  You're already pleasing her, that's why she's buying you a drink.


Take advantage of your environment.  We were at an huge bar with multiple levels, we had two or three rounds.  Be practical and know you're surroundings: my strategy was to take our drinks tp the patio because the patio was quieter and less packed, therefore we could talk without yelling and drink without getting bumped/spilling.  It also created a nice environmental balance.  Staying in one place eventually gets boring so mix it up!  Girls will show you with their body language when they're ready for a change in environment, the key is to see her bored eyes and make the change in environment seem like your idea. and STAY POSITIVE!

At a certain point, and talked to them a bit.  Later on, Jamie went to the bathroom, and i saw these two girls near where me and my buddy were waiting.  I told my buddy to hang on a sec and went to talk to them (they weren't interested in him Having a good looking girl with me created social proof, so they were either attracted to me or enticed enough to convserse for a few minutes.  I escalated kino with the two of them pretty quickly, holding one girl's wrist when  I asked about her tattoo, and touching their shoulders when I made a joke (nothing groundbreaking I know

I kept the bathroom Jamie used in my peripheral vision and decided to end the interaction with these two girls about a minute after she exited the bathroom.  This gave her enough time to go back to where we were waiting, but it only worked for the following reasons:  My friend was uninterested in Jamie, he trusted me completely, and both of us were unintersted in the other girls. I told the girls I had to meet up with my friends, hugged them both and went to Jamie and my friend.  The only thing I said regarding that situation was saying ""Those girls are crazy"" with a smile.  Talking to the other girls was probably unnecessary, but if you have a sure thing, it doesn't hurt to exercise your game. This *exercise* framed me as the *prize* in Jamie's eyes, and allowed Jamie to feel relieved when she saw me return.


We eventually took a cab (paid for by Jamie) to a cheaper bar about a block from my apartment.  We met up with Susie (a girl my friend knew and was interested in), and took it back to my apartment.  An alpha  always pays a girl back and won't let her think he's taking advantage of her physically, emotionally or economically.


We eat the pizza watching sports center, for the first time in a little more than a year, I had sex and it was awesome haha.


A few key things: I stopped masturbating a little less than three weeks prior to this date (don't fap, and eventually made plans to see her again this coming weekend (this helped with the oneitis more than the sex did, but I'm fairly sure neither of us want a relationship at this juncture).  Even if you don't want a relationship, the day after text is important because girls get nervous about their sexual peformance, too (especially if alcohol is involved).  RELAX AND STAY POSITIVE.


I know this field report is long as fuck


I also wanted to note that, Depression and anxiety. It's easy to get fooled by our sexual *American Pie* culture constantly telling us that happiness is a warm pussy.  I fucked a hot girl and, without even realizing it, expected that I'd instantly be a happier, cooler person.  When I wasn't transformed,  the normal depression and anxiety I feel and deal with everyday blindsided me.  I was so caught up in thinking I was someone else, I forgot who I am and how I normally feel. To clarify, but they don't really effect me because I live a generally healthy lifestyle.  The happiness that results from my healthy lifestyle and the advice I took from this subreddit are why I had the confidence are the tools I needed to have sex.  Sex with an attractive girl isn't a source of instant happiness

1363450014.0,1aew73,Kind vs. Nice - a possible series of word pair problems,blindwombat,493,78,64,"No one asked for this

A little background: *I'm not a pick up artist

If you are looking for something more generalised: I'm a firm believer in genuine seduction through motivation

A long time ago I compiled a few bits and pieces from various forums and books and put them on a background of a Zooey Deschanel poster and posted it on 4chan. You've probably seen it

Nice/Kind, Random/Spontaneous, Arrogance/Confidence, Confidence/Comfort.

If you like bold statements: **learning the difference between these words is key not only to pick up

**Part One: Nice vs. Kind**

**Nice:**

The vast majority of people grew up in a caring family

You've probably got someone you work with who continuously tells you that ""you're great"" and things are ""awesome"" even though you barely speak and what you are actually doing is ""routine"" and ""ordinary"".  **Nice is an unbalancing act, with fapstronauts it's pornstars, with redpillars it's god knows what these days. However like I said before I believe in behaviourism and therefore the easiest behaviour to change is yours.

Can we apply this concept to yourself? Of course! The nice guy. We all love that phrase. Nice guys finish last. Why is that?  The easiest way to explain this is with a magic trick. 

I pull out a coin from my pocket and ask to borrow a cigarette or pen from you. I open my palm and place the coin flat in my left hand. Taking the pen in my right I tell you to focus on the coin and watch. I tap the coin with the pen once

Now **imagine someone who was watching the trick turns to you and tries to impress you with exactly the same trick. Are you impressed? No of course not

The same goes with ""nice guy"" attitudes. **The majority of people have been taught to ""be nice"", everyone in the room can see you're ""being nice"". Everyone can see you're putting on a front; in this case to get laid. You end up putting people on a pedestal and when you've got them up that high it's very difficult to ask them to come down to go on a date with you.

Nice is **nasty**

~~~~~~

**Kind**

OK so we've dropped ""being nice""

Kindness is often linked to religion and morality. You hear phrases like ""Christian values"" or ""religious driving practices"", isn't easy.** Being nice is easy to do, you just continuously act and without fail do the ""nice"" thing. Being kind is about doing the right thing, not the easy thing. This generally involves taking time out of your routine or schedule to help someone else without thought of being rewarded for it. **You are being kind because you want to be.**

Niceness as I've said is an act whereas kindness, a desire and almost instinctive. This is part of what I believe in seduction is letting an ideal or a motivation go from practice to permanence. If you allow it to stop being an act it will become a part of your genuine self.

Where does kindness come into seduction? **Well kindness builds trust and rapport with people** as opposed to being a nice guy which breeds distrust through your manipulative ways. **Kindness plays into the abundance mindset** as well, socialise, mix with people and most importantly have fun.

Here's another example of the difference between kindness and niceness. Imagine someone came up to you in the middle of the street and said ""hey there's this brand new club it's doing this drink offer tonight…"" most people know that this is a complete façade, then someone comes over and says ""are you looking for ____. Well you're a bit far away from it to be fair, there is a club just down the road and if I hear right they're doing this drink offer."" 

The two events are framed differently and said differently

A final point: the two questions that go through a girls mind when a guy approaches are widely said to be: ""what does this guy want?"" and ""how long is he going to be here"". Many people try and diffuse these situations with time markers

Kindness is a demonstration of **caring

Imagine that you tell a joke. But nobody gets it. Feels pretty bad

Now, but nobody laughs. 

Now, as theirs are to you.

I'm sure you have been in a class, then everybody moved on with their lives. At the end of the day, nobody remembered it.

Do you feel that you have a bad hair day? How often have you looked at someone and actually cared wether they have a lock hanging out of place or not? 

Do you think you have too hairy arms? Keep trying to cover them up? How many times have you actually noticed how hairy someone is when you sit next to them in class

Point being: You feel much worse about your own mistakes than you need to do. And allowing them to become a much bigger deal than they actually are serves only to damage your confidence.

Don't be too afraid to make a fool out of yourself to act. At the end of the day

&gt; You have sex with a random chick

This post is dedicated to all of you who will become good at seduction and who sleep with lots of girls. With great power

**NEVER lose sight of your original goal.**

**I repeat: NEVER lose sight of your original goal.**

If you get into this because you want to develop deep connections with women and find that someone special to settle down with

It's entirely possible to sleep around and develop deep connections with people. I've successfully done this

But I've also spent years developing an inner strength that allows me to do this. If you rush into success with women

Just keep your original goal in mind at all times. Random sex is fantastic (lol who am I to judge!) but if it's real connections you want

The attraction phase of seduction gets the most discussion because it is the point where most guys struggle with the most. But it's the comfort phase where real connections take place. Don't ignore it if building real connections is your goal.

If you are unsure of what your goals are - what your VALUES are - you have some deep introspection to do. You are never going to be a truly awesome creature if you do not understand your values. This is quoted directly from my post on the [8 characteristics of a Modern Alpha Male:](http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/fobhj/lesson_1_primer_on_being_a_modern_alpha_male/)

&gt; You have meditated and thought about your deepest inner values. You are unwavering on these. These can include things as basic as love of life, religion, or not tolerating condescension or self-defeating behavior. These are the basic pieces that make up your personality and it is important to know what they are. The average, beta male has trouble describing his personal values to others. He looks to others to define who he is. This will not be you. YOU will define who you are. Nobody else.

You have it in you. Don't ever lose sight of your goal.",,t5_2qhrv,True,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/tewqk/words_of_advice_to_those_who_get_good_at_this/

So I was bored and alone last night

I decided that I was going to try something completely new and retarded. I was going to go up to every girl

**First girl I approached

""Hey what's your name""

""Hey! I'm lisa""

""I like your name lisa

""Eww you're such a perv!""

""Your loss lisa"" - wink at her and move on

**Second girl I approached was a smoking hot russian looking blond HB9**

""Hey I like your shoes

At which point she has a complete ""WTF face"" going on

Her ""Excuse me??""

""I said I really like your eyes

At this point shes really confused but smirking/giggling. I love it.

""What's your name?""

**""I'm Isabella""**

**""Nice to meet you Isabella

Her ""Are you fucking crazy or retarded?""

""Which one's more fun in bed? That one""

Her ""Where do you get all of this?""

""I'm a natural

""Her ""What?""

""We should totally fuck and make a bunch of ridiculously good looking babies""

Her ""Woah woah woah slow down I don't even know your name""

""I'll tell you my name in the heat of the moment

Her ""Well I tell you what

""Ok well you should give me your number because this is a once in a lifetime opportunity""

She gave me her number and we parted ways. **She asked me to give her my number also but I declined and told her she'd know it's me when I call her. I'm going to call her and tell her it's batman lol.** Really cool chick with a great sense of humor.

After I finished talking to HB9, my guess is that she got jealous that I was having such a good time with a better looking chick.

So, as I’ve done before, and tell her how I have a thing for girls with red hair and that she totally fits the bill. I’ll ask her for her name and what her story is. She’ll tell me about how she’s in school for a passion of hers, and I’ll tell her how it means a lot to me when people are passionate. Or, she’ll tell me she’s doing some mundane job, and I’ll ask her if she’s happy and try to offer new perspective. I will find out, “who is this beautiful stranger?” And I will put the two of us in a bubble for a moment in time, and then we may meet again.

But then you begin making excuses. She’s wearing headphones and we’re on a subway car. Who knows how far she’s going? Maybe she doesn’t want to talk. Not that I care if anyone sees me try, the adrenaline, that’s why it’s there. It’s telling me “Connect. Meet. Learn, live.”

She’s getting up, she has red hair. Tomorrow, she may have curly brown hair, or may be wearing a leather jacket, or have silky tan skin with a cute little birthmark to remind me that imperfections are to be loved. And maybe this time, I’ll approach her and tell her I think she’s the sexiest girl I’ve seen that day and that her birthmark is adorable. She’ll laugh in a moment of unexpected discomfort combined with a bit of intrigue an lust, wondering “Who is this man? How is he so bold? Can I trust him?” And I will be there to answer all.

Who is this man? One that is certainly centered, how couldn’t I be? If I weren’t, I would miss out on the chance to meet someone like you, and I don’t want to miss these connections anymore. Can I be trusted? Well, can anyone be trusted? Yes, they can, for every human anyone has ever befriended or loved was once a stranger. I’m just here to tear down the barrier, so that we may connect.

The next day, she’s a short blonde girl. Frail and delicate. Thump, thump, thump. I feel another shot of adrenaline surge through me, telling me to meet her, ordering me to connect.

1349725299.0,115itl,Guide to Living with Your Parents,kdelamont,522,112,116,"I've seen a lot of users complaining that its hard to pull girls when you live with your parents. I've been doing this for about a year now, but the principles here are the same. Allow me to flesh out some key points: 


- **Respect your parents as adults, enjoy conversation, enjoy company. Treat your parents as you might treat a guy or girl friend. Spend a night with them now and again, let them know what is going on in your life, ask what is going on in theirs. Go out and grab a beer with your dad now and again. Find the common interests you have and work with that. If you see your parents as adults and social beings, they will respond in turn. 

- **Embrace home living.** For whatever reason you stil llive at home (for me its that I'm moving to England, then you should probably think about moving. That said, if you're at home because you're really close with your family, say that. If you needed some time to get back on your feet after losing a job, own that. There's nothing inherently wrong with living at home. Sure, it COULD be construed as a DLV, but only if you let it. 

- **Let your parents know that you have a sexual life.** Yes, your parents will come around to this. For example: when I first started pulling girls on a regular basis, my parent asked me what was up with the girls. I responded by telling it like it is: these are girls I'm seeing occasionally, but it's nothing too serious. Since then, I've had girls come over for ONS and crash at my place, with no parental imposition. I've also had girls show up to morning coffee with me, parent, they will almost always conform to it. 

- **Move your bedroom away from the same hall as your parents.** This should be relatively self explanatory. You need your space for yourself just as much as you do for women. If you want, both yourself and with lady. 

- **Use the resources at your disposal.** Will most college-aged/twenty-something apartments have the kind of things that you and your parents have amassed over the years? Probably not. E.g. My house has a fantastic wok pan, I gear my game towards cooking for a girl if I have a night to myself. My house also has a tremendous library of music anda fantastic stereo system - do you think I use the iPod dock to play top 40 when a girl comes over? Not a chance. 

- **Take your opportunities WHENEVER they come.** Having the house to yourself

- **Game will be slower - expect less ONS, he is going to stuff her like a christmas turkey. 

Some other little tidbits:

- Maintain a healthy relationship and understanding with any siblings. They let you have a night without them around
- MAke your living space an adult living space
- Take everything you learn from having to game while living at home

Living at home is not the death-knell for game. IF you own it, take the girls house. But DO NOT discount how effectively one can game while living at home.

1359494990.0,17ip5p,My transformation. Thank you Seddit.,Degradable,506,99,168,"I've been meaning to write this for a while. Thank you Seddit.

**Background**

I went out with a girl for 2 years. It was my first serious relationship and it seemed great at the time. In the end I broke up with her and I felt fucking amazing. For a grand total of 2 weeks. Then it sunk in, but I'll just call it post-relationship blues.

Started reading Seddit and started progressing. I was petrified on my first date. I was so scared I almost persuaded myself to go home. That date turned into a fuck buddy who I still see.

**Transformation**

Fast forward to now and I feel fucking amazing. I'm more successful than I've ever been. In the last 3 weeks I've had sex with two 8s and a 10. After having sex with the 10 I just had to tell Seddit. The stuff you read **REALLY** works. I'll save some of those stories for FRs.

I wanted to share the most important things I've learnt along the way:

* **Read Seddit** - Well done
* **Go to the fucking gym** - You'll feel so much better seeing yourself improve. I started going 3 times a week. Looked up a good weights program and followed it. Your confidence goes through the fucking roof. Women now tell me on a day to day basis how good I look. That feels amazing.
* **Get a job you fucking enjoy** - If you have a stimulating job which you enjoy
* **Speak to EVERYONE** - I can't stress this enough. My confidence levels went through the fucking roof as soon as I started speaking to everyone. Girl behind the till
* **Eye contact** - A great technique for improving confidence is looking at everyone you see walking down the street. ONLY break eye contact when they look away. It's fucking petrifying at the start
* **Read your favourite seddit post or seduction quote before you go out** - It's amazing how quickly you forget amazing pieces of advice or new things you want to try out. Read it before you go out
* **Have fun** - that's why you're reading this. You love seduction and you love women. At no point should it be a chore. You're seeing yourself improve all the time and trust me

Most importantly. **Just fucking do it.** Every post says it, get numbers, text them, date them, fuck them.

Thank you Seddit.

**TL;DR: I went from a harsh break up to being more successful than I ever have. I'm feeling the best I've ever felt through a transformation period of a few months thanks to Seddit.**

I like to floss in the shower. I'm weird like that. I get into the shower, flossing stops being automatic. I've broken my habit. Now, when I step into the shower, I have a huge question in my mind: Do I floss today or do I not floss today? 

It's good for me to floss every day. But would it be so bad if I flossed 6 out of 7 days? Probably not. I probably would not see a huge rise in my cavities. But you and I know

How did I go from skipping one day to flossing only once a month? It was because of that quick rationalization that it's okay to skip one day. Theoretically

It's the same thing for me with going out and talking with women.

There is a cost for me when I go out to meet women. I'm old. I get tired from walking around. If I'm going to be seeing a woman tonight

And the worst part about this is that it was once automatic. Now it's a chore. Getting up and going out has now become something I need to think about. I agonize over it. It takes a ton of mental energy.

1348775713.0,10kvh6,"""Your thoughts are not you"" OR ""Stop listening to your scumbag brain""",archaicfrost,514,106,114,"*I'm going to make reference to brain science, my interpretation of how these things relate has really helped me

**Behind the scenes**

Your brain is a lazy asshole. Its only objective is to conserve as much energy as possible

This is why it seems to make more sense to skip the gym, and watch TV or play video games, than do anything else. It's easy, and you're conserving energy. You're not going to be winded and tired if you don't go to the gym. Those cookies might not be healthy, but they sure are delicious - and they're packed full of calories so you have some *backup* backup energy reserves stored up.

This isn't your brain's fault

**The Problem**

This carries over into every other facet of your life. Your brain is great at convincing you that what it wants is what YOU want.

""If you talk to that pretty girl

""Wouldn't you much rather sit at home than go out? It's been a long week

Now you're overweight, and lonely. You could take responsibility for this, and totally turn things around, but it's going to require a lot of work, a lot of time, and effort.

This is when your brain comes back and says ""but you're a great guy! It must be everyone else's fault! They don't give us a chance! They're biased against us because of ______. Guess we're going to be forever alone

**GET OVER IT**

I could say people just need to man up, and just grow up. Really, this is true, but it's not very useful advice. Your brain is going to work against you at almost every step. How can you overcome this negative self-talk?

**Perception**

There's a concept in Buddhism called ""dependent arising."" The basic concepts around this are (1) everything is a result of cause and effect and (2) ""self"" only exists in dependence upon causes and conditions.

Both of these points are very valuable to us. The first point is pretty straight forward and helps emphasize one of the main beliefs held by our community - if you're happy

The second point is more complicated

Well, you'd still be YOU, right? Even your brain is made up of cells that are made up of elements that are made up of atoms made up of quarks made up of energy. Bits and pieces that could have been rabbits, or trees, or air, or stars, before they were repurposed into you.

What about your mind, sometimes I change my mind about things - either I learn something new, or find out something wasn't true, or my opinion simply changes over time. If I define who I am by beliefs that I hold, and those beliefs change, then I guess I'm not ME anymore? That doesn't make any sense. We're pretty complicated, but we're never surpised when our thoughts or feelings change.

So if it can't be the body

**Thinking**

Thoughts are a lot like carbon dioxide molecules - they're around us all the time

There was a relevant quote in /r/meditation the other day:

&gt;Suffering is caused by compulsive thinking. We get lost in thoughts, stress, and the problems of everyday life.  
&gt;You can break your identification with compulsive thinking, the nose, the tongue, and the skin. But, you don't think that you are what you see, what you hear, what you smell, or what you touch. View your thoughts the same way - your brain processes them, and destructive - you simply let float away.  
&gt;Treat non-useful thoughts like undesirable smells: don't dwell on them, don't get lost in them - simply let them float away.

This is where meditation can be a great ally in the war against thinking.

You sit, then you let them go. This is easier said than done, and it takes practice, but that's really all there is to it. In the activities post from earlier in the week a lot of people said that meditation didn't stick, that it was boring, or even they did it for months but never had that ""AHA!"" moment where everything in their lives changed. OF COURSE NOT! If it's boring, it's because you're thinking about what you could be doing, or you're thinking that it's boring. There is no ""AHA!"" moment in meditation - some days are better than others and you sit for a long time with only a handful of thoughts that pass immediately

But once you do, or if that HB really likes you. You're not judging yourself, you're not even judging others. Better yet - you don't even care, because you aren't thinking about it. You are just existing, enjoying being alive. If you've ever opened a set, had a good time, then when you walked away went ""whoa... how did I just pull that off?"" you know what I'm talking about.

If you tend towards thinking way too much, like you had an out of body experience. But the more it happens, the more you realize how liberating, how amazing, how wonderful it is - and you start to get to know the real you.

**Self**

And that's the real you, or makes you comb over every word after the fact trying to figure out where you screwed up.

You're not too introverted, or boring, or ugly, or stupid; that's all your scumbag brain. You just *are*.


**Conclusion**

Your brain doesn't care about you. Whether you are happy, emotionally damaged, and sitting at home alone every weekend, it makes no difference to your brain as long as it gets what it needs to survive. Excuses and negative thoughts are your brain's way of controlling you, and it's amazing how much power most of us give it.

Wanting to change is not enough

So the next time you say you're going to start exercising, or doing something that interests you, and you hear that little voice trying to convince you otherwise, ignore it and go about your life.

1367787358.0,1dr0xg,Billy's Guide to Kino,bl1y,508,103,49,"Early and often is the rule.

Make physical contact very early in your interaction with a girl. The easiest way to do this is to touch her on the shoulder or arm to get her attention.

The reason you need to make contact early on is because those first few moments set up the frame for the rest of your interaction. This is where you’re establishing the rules for how you and the girl will interact. If there’s no contact at all, it’s going to be awkward, all the attention will be on it, and it’s like you’ve just smashed through a plate glass window.

On the other hand, if it’s even awkward at all. Don’t wait too long to kino a second time though, because the parameters of your interaction can change. Go too long with no contact and that wall starts to get built up between you. Early and often.

**How the heck do you do this?**

Many guys complain that they just don’t know how to kino, you just have to learn what it’s supposed to feel like and become comfortable through experience.

If you need a crutch to facilitate kino, as there are a lot that involve placing something in a girl’s hand, or moving her hands around for any number of reasons — “Hold your hands outs. …No, like this,” and you move them into the correct position.

And of course

**Don’t be needy**

Not being needy is just a great rule for life, escalate, escalate. You haven’t touched a girl in forever, so you’re trying to get in as much contact as you can. You’re like a camel filling up on water at an oasis, and the girl will definitely pick up on this. Once she realizes that this is a novel experience for you, you’ll have exposed your low value, and she’ll be turned off.

Treat kino as an opportunity for push/pull. When you kiss her, and then kiss her again a few minutes later. This sends two messages; first that you’re not desperate for a little action, and second that you’re actually interested in her as a person. Every girl knows that you want to kiss her, what she’s hoping is that you’ll also want to talk to her after. So talk to her after.

**Proximity matters**

Think about standing close to each other as a form of kino. You will occasionally have some light bumps in to each other

You’ll also build a lot of sexual tension just by standing very close. Even without contact, and it’s almost like a static charge begins to build up.

I’m recently single for the very first time since highschool so I have absolutely no clue what the norm is. I’m completely oblivious to guys hitting on me. I get calls like 3 days later from my friends while doing the dishes just to realise that

I found this subreddit. And
After a bit of digging

First of all,  most of them were basically “Show interest  by making eye contact and smiling”. I was disappointed but I'm still on holiday and I have a lot of free thinking time. So I wondered...

**What if? I applied ALL of the male tips? And used it. On guys. Would they be intimidated? Would I come off as desperate? Masculine?... hmm... Fuck it. I decided to test it**

Step 1: Look dashing. Cool and classy as fuck yet casual. (Bitch
Step 2: Go out. Proceed to interact with strangers.

What follows is a generalised summarized transcript from recollection of a small sample. I tried direct approach, hold my phone against my shoulder and proceed like this:

**Me**: Hey..Hi..Sorry, to turn it off or something while he answers...*]  
**Hims:** *Laughter* Well
**Me**: You’re welcome. [*I put phone away. Go for a hand shake.*]  I’m forgetitok btw.


[Fast forward]  
10 #close of which 2 Insta dates.  
The first one was ok

[...]  
**Him**: So how often do you kidnap men from the streets luring them in with a cold beverage?  
**Me**: This week? Pff - I dunno
**Him**: Ha. [*grin*]  I like your banter.  
**Me**: That’s probably because you find me attractive. [ *I shudder in my head and try not to laugh after realising how cringe worthy that sounds when actually said out loud*]  
**Him**: Ha [*shit eating grin*] Even though you’re very right... I did not stop you in the middle of the street to tell you that you’re beautiful.  
**Me**: Haha Don’t beat yourself up. There’s plenty of time to make up for that.  
**Him**: Don’t worry I will. I would not want to take a risk and end up in your basement...  
**Me**: Hm [*shit eating grin*] You sure?  
[...]

I really don’t know what to think about this particular interaction. It’s like we were both doing the same thing
So

Now... I know that **the main difference between male and female pua styles is the goal in mind**. And I know that men are generally swimming against the tide to get an F-close. But today I realised I had a fucking jetski. I still want to do it but it takes the whole fun out of it. So I dunno, realising stuff. 
Another interesting thought: if I make talking/#closing/f-closing my intention from the get go

Either way. I’m going to keep doing this. It’s hella fun. It's making me think a lot. I'll do an indirect approach next time. Maybe add some challenges. Like a lisp or a limp.

I'm really interested to know what you think, or whatever. 

I just wanted to share this cos it was pretty awesome.

**Edit: for the ""This is clearly Bullshit. All she has to do is open her legs and she'll get it"" thinking crowd:  
1)My goal is not an F-close. I could. But doesn't have to be.   
2)I WANT to be picky. In fact
3)I'm only average looking.**

This is PERFECT for those times when you see a girl sitting alone, on the train, at the bar... wherever.

Normally it'd be a bit awkward to sit right next to her

——————————————————

**SAY THIS:**

*So

*Well, ‘cause everyone is afraid of touching the other person and no one wants to get sued.*

*But in South America

*So if you put someone from north america in the same room as someone from south america

*The north american then feels uncomfortable and backs away. Which makes the south american uncomfortable

*So as they're talking—and neither of them are aware of it—they're doing a little dance around the room.*

And that's it. That's my baby. I've used this over and over and over again. 

Why is it so awesome?

When you plop down right next to a girl

And how do we get rid of anxiety? **We bring it into the real world.**

After reading someone's post on Seddit about older women

I was, I actually now have to juggle dates, and texting/phonecalls from multiple women at the same time - I usually only dealt with 1 or 2 at a time before - and, while these women are generally a bit reserved at first, once you get past their initial defenses, they're wild and enthusiastic lovers.  So thank you to everyone on here who posted suggestions, you've greatly improved my personal life!

In the interest of giving back a bit

* **Women won't always (often) make the first move.**  If a woman has viewed your profile, it goes nowhere.  However, the amount of 'Oh, I saw your profile and hoped you'd message me' replies I've gotten *once I initiated contact* have been astounding.

* **You must, get back to the clubs.  Online, all you've got at first is your verbal game.  Polish it.  Even if it's a turd, get out the cloth and shine that shit up real good.  You'll be better than 80% of the guys out there already just by putting in minimal effort.

* **Escalate quickly** - meaning, and that if they want to get ahold of me more reliably, or get faster responses, they're better off communicating directly.  It's a more 'intimate' way of interacting, and I've often found that a nice polite woman in online messages turns into a risque seductress trying to get me to want her (ah the irony) fairly quickly after we transition to text, or voice chat. Protip: If you can get them to call you late at night, even better

* **Watch out for crazy** There are some (small percentage) of women on there who simply can't get a guy in any normal way

* **Do not pretend to be someone you're not in your profile** You're going to come across as confident, or the lady in question is just going to feel *very* awkward and want to get away quickly.  No one likes feeling lied to, so make sure you can back up your talk.  I've heard so many tales by this point of 'Oh, I'm glad you're the same you were online', because lots of guys act one way there, and then are total socially awkward penguins in person.

Anyhow, happy, and appreciative of you guys! Thanks, Seddit!

##Teasing##

*****

  This may help: [“3 Rules I Live By”]( http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/rmxm8/3_rules_i_live_by_everyday/)
 
In order to pull teasing off effectively

When you tease
    

 
**Teasing is used to:**  

1. Establish frame control, deal with AMOGs.  

2. Build rapport/comfort – Teasing is something people do when they’ve known each other for awhile.  

3. Establish Value – People only tease people of equal or lesser value than themselves.  

4. Create Push-Pull 

5. Produce shit tons of Callback Humor

6. **Teasing** (as opposed to its uglier cousin
     1. You're not going to put her on a pedestal. You're a confident person
     1. You've noticed (or made up) her imperfections
     1. You're a funny person who is comfortable pushing conversational boundaries. This is sexy. (credit chris5100)

 
###OTHER NOTES!!!

  1. (**!!!**) Remember
  2. It's not what you say
  3. You don't need to use that many of these. At all. Seriously.  
  4. If you think these are too mean
  5. I use these at house parties. It may work at clubs (I don't game there much at all

  1. __[On Calibrating Teases](http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/sv7tk/a_not_so_quick_guide_to_teasing_pt_1/c4hau8e)__

*****
 
1.	**Be enthusiastic. First and foremost.**
    1.	Be loud. LOUD. 
    3. HAVE FUN
    2.	Exaggerate. A lot. Avoid sounding try hard.
    3.	If you give shit out, and use a lot of teeth.”^__(CAREFUL)__ A girl calls you an asshole, either make a scene about it by starting a fake fight or agree with her. “I know, I’m pretty much the world’s biggest asshole. You should probably not talk to me.”
    4.	Make a scene about things.
    5.	Don’t be monotone, pauses. Use commas, just wherever, when you're talking if you do, in fact, have problems slowing yourself down.
    6.	Careful with making the conversation sexual; use more blunt sexual teases when no one else is listening.
    7.	Don’t joke or tease too hard while the conversation is on something serious.
    8.	Learn what vocal inflections work for you voice and style.
    9.	Watch for reactions (without seeming reaction seeking). If her body language &amp; mouth both are locking up
    10.	Make sure never to genuinely offend someone. If you do
    11.	Either of those should be followed by
    12.	Ask a simple
    13.	If there’s resistance, go SOFTLY back into it.^__(CAREFUL)__
    14.	Tell a woman
    15.	 ""You’re totally checking me out...Aren't you?""
    16. (**!!!!**) Use lines from movies/tv/standup bits. I like using Louis C.K. lines. ""Quit being such a faggot. Not like a homosexual. You're just being a... faggot."" ""I would never use that word to describe a homosexual. Unless he said something like, simply say where you quoted it from and state that you thought it was hilarious. You can transition from this by saying, ""It's funny what we as people find funny. So much humor is just so messed up."" This can get her talking for a bit and completely distract from the rude comment.



2.	**Start light
    1.	Ramp it up to bigger (more obvious) teases.
    2.	As you get to know her, teasing will help keep her around and interested. 
    3.	Laugh a lot
    5.	You won’t be obviously just going after her if you throw teases out to everyone. This will make her feel less singled out
    6.	Teases towards female obstacles can create a jealousy plotline.  
    6. _Hug Test_: When she hugs you, I'll say C-."" (Don't give her higher than an A-.)


2.	**Treat her like a little sister.**
    1.	If you don't have one (I don't) watch standup comedians talk about their younger sister or daughter
    3.	Make fun of anything she messes up or that you can spin it to make her look silly.
    4.	Call her names like sweetie, I’m not that easy.”
    5.	Call her names like Goober, that's the point*)   
    6.  REMEMBER: Keep your voice inflecting up to sound playful. 
    6.  “You know what
    6.	When you’re walking with her, pillars, telephone poles. *Not into buses.*
     7.	 Personally
    8.	(**!!!**) Qualify her by teasing. “You look/seem like you could be the world’s biggest Hanna Montana fan.” “I’m sure there’s more to you than meets the eye
    9. When she's taking herself seriously and/or in a position of power, how cute."" and proceed to act as if she's a 7 year old explaining her stuffed animal tea parties to you. (credit dablac)


3.	**Act like she always needs parental supervision.**  
    1.	Especially if she’s young.  ""You're such a little brat (laugh here to break tension if need be)
    2.	""You're ridiculous.""
    3.	""You're too young to be drinking that!"" (Grab her drink, and not for very long, otherwise they can find it annoying.)
    4.	""I'm going to put you in timeout
    5.	Making plans: ""Okay so here’s the plan, my mom comes in every 10 minutes and does a hand check.""

4.	**Mock her
    1.	You can repeat her verbatim.^__(CAREFUL)__ 
    2.	 If she has a country accent
    4.	Role Play: Act like a high maintenance girl. 
     5.	Fake fight over something emotional and really girly. Act offended
     6.	If she calls you an asshole or makes fun of you: Overreact by freaking out “Fine! I see how it is!” (Storm off)
     7.	“You know what?! That’s it! We’re breaking up
     8.	“Oh no. I think you got me pregnant…” (Blame sharing a drink, even a handshake or thumb wars.)
    13.	Frame her as a stalker/creeper. “Don’t make me get a restraining order (again).” “Stop following me!” “Look

5.	**Misinterpret things she says and your environment in general.** 
    1.	This is so important because if you’re out of things to say
    2.	 She tells you where she’s from: “I hear people from there smell bad/are boring/tell terrible stories. 
    3.	Follow up statements in respective order: “Keep your arms down just in case.”/ “You aren’t boring
    4.	 Say she brings a drink back to the table or orders a drink in front of you: “Oh my
    5.	If her hair is curly: “I love straight hair!” (Or vice versa) while quickly and gently playing with her hair.

It seemed hopeless. Now we were even closer in proximity to the group and an exit together into the rain in the direction of my apartment would be deciphered as nothing other than a move to late night sex. 

Then, I took her hand and lead her out in the rain, to the middle of the street. The rain pelted us, and within a few steps I could already feel my shoes get heavy as they filled with water. When we reached the middle of the street, I turned and looked at her. She looked dumbfounded as to what was going on but before she could say ""What the fuck are you doing?"" I leaned in and kissed her. 

The kiss lasted only 45 seconds or so, and now she experienced that in reality. After the kiss, there was about 10 seconds of silence and then I said ""Let's go home.""

As I left with her hugging my arm, I don't think she cared that they saw us. Our cold drenched clothes came off immediately upon arrival to my room.

Most nerds strongest trait is their ability to analyze things on a very intricate level. But sometimes this is bad. Overthinking stuff sucks sometimes. Often, although we hate to admit it, we sometimes freeze up when the pressure is on, like a Microsoft blue screen. All this makes socializing, well, suck. If this sounds like you, below are some...affirmations, but only because my experiences say so. All i know is what's inside my head. Find your own strategy too and contribute.)

1) ""I am overthinking this."" Admit when you are. If you think you may be

2) ""I trust my intuition."" Captain Kirk was a better leader than Spock. Spock was more intelligent, he had to trust his instincts. You doing so will not allow you to pull a lightsaber out of a snow pile ten feet away, but it will get you a lot less stress in life and make you feel stronger and more complete. The road to confidence won't always be logically clear-cut. You'll just have to trust your gut sometimes. If you worry about doing the wrong thing, remember your intuition isn't intended to be correct, it's intended to give you a backup when logic fails, which leads to:

3) ""I do not know what the answer is, you don't actually know for 100% what anyone else is thinking or feeling, even when they tell you. Consequently you are not going to know if what you just said or did made them like you more or less, and 99% of the time you will never know. There is nothing you can do about it. I know this doesn't sound like an affirmation, but you'll find if you do it you'll feel a lot less pressure and relaxed. This is NOT an invitation to feel helpless or reckless. This is a way of liberating yourself from fear when in a high-pressure situation.

4) ""I am not expecting any specific result from this."" Similar to number 3, but oddly enough expecting a result is completely counterproductive. Why? I don't know, and that's okay. :-)

5) ""I am a nerd, and it's imperative to social confidence moreso than anything else I've encountered. You can cut out other unattractive things you don't really care about, but if you love doing something, do...period.

6) ""Get off the computer."" Thinking is no substitute for doing. This website can only give you 50% of what you need, I just feel like we should make the most of the situations that come our way. But if you avoid social situations because they make you uncomfortable, experiencing that discomfort is imperative to overcoming it. Nobody said it would be easy, but...

7) ""This should be fun."" This is a learning process, which is highly illogical. :-)

So, buck teeth, major babyface -- girls used to call me ugly. Here's the funny thing: I'm not even bad looking. Quite the contrary, I'm a good looking guy -- not model material, but a guy that girls consider ""cute"". But because I *assumed* I was ugly, I never had any luck with women. Never had a girlfriend, had first kiss at 19 and it wasn't even a real one. It's only recently I've managed to bust past this horrible insecurity

Alright

**You don't know what is and isn't good looking. So stop trying.**

Many times on this sub-reddit, but often times men exaggerate shit that doesn't even matter.

Jawline is the main thing -- guys see a man with a sharp jawline and automatically assume he's hot shit. In reality

**Girls are SUPER different when it comes to tastes.**

This is something I only came to learn when I did a ton of research on it. I literally asked dozens of girls on their opinions of guys and people were overwhelmingly different. One of my friends thinks Ryan Gosling is not physically attractive at all. Another one of my friends says the same thing about Brad Pitt. One of my friends thinks J. Cole is the sexiest man alive... another of my girl friends is revolted by his appearance.

Guys don't understand this, doesn't find someone like Chris Hemsworth to be all that appealing to the eyes -- but a guy wearing hip-hop clothes immediately catches her eye. Types are a *huge* deal for girls, and assuming you dress well, you're almost guaranteed that there's some girls out there who find you hotter than some much ""prettier"" celebrities.

**Attraction simply isn't dependent on looks. At all.**

Okay, Community is a sitcom starring a bunch of people at a community college. Among these people are two of the group's most attractive men, Jeff Winger and Troy Barnes. These are the respective actors playing these characters:

Joel McHale playing Jeff Winger: http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-6TKOJ0DA8ns/T_K0fEc0KkI/AAAAAAAAL3s/x6dz6ry9ShY/s1600/Joel-McHale-shirtless-6.jpg

Donald Glover playing Troy Barnes: http://www2.pictures.zimbio.com/gi/Community+Red+Carpet+2010+Comic+Con+2tXLMQi0HKnl.jpg

Joel McHale is very traditionally good looking -- tall, high cheek bones, sharp jawline, great hair, etc. Donald Glover on the other hand is kind of funny looking... he's short, with a big head. Good looking certainly, but nothing very special. 

And yet equally as many women, has swagger and confident as sh*t. There's actually an askwomen thread about those two, and IIRC most of the girls picked Glover over McHale. If you go to r/ladyboners, you can see how much of a local favorite Donald Glover is there. He's a good looking guy, but he's not someone that's going to turn heads the moment you look at him -- but his attitude makes him insanely attractive.

Another example is Joseph Gordon-Levitt. He's certainly a very good looking guy, like this (minus the hair): http://nymag.com/images/2/daily/fashion/08/05/12_jkortajarena_lgl.jpg

However, charm and style has made him one of the biggest sex symbols of this decade.

**Finally

Look, the famous 20th century poet, had a hideous face scarred by cystic acne and medical testing that made him look like a buffalo (Google him if you don't believe me)... and yet he was so much of a womanizer that the show Californication was *based on his life*.

The problem is, a more handsome man would take him away from me. I spent ages trying to break through that thought pattern until I realized one thing -- *if someone doesn't want to be with you because your jaw isn't sharp enough, why would you want to be with them?* Picking the person you spend your life with based on their facial structure is absurd. 

At the end of the day, not the shape of your face -- on one condition: **that you love yourself**.

So be your best self... become an amazing person. You'll get laid on a regular basis as many of the PUA's around here can attest

**On the other hand

If you plan on running game in a club

1. **You need to be in a crew of extroverts.** Sorry introverts
2. **Every single person in your crew must either have zero approach anxiety, don't invite them to the club. They won't have fun, and neither will you.
3. **Have some good looking girls in your crew.** Don't tell me you don't know at least one 7+ girl who will go to a club with you. If you don't
4. **Dance with everyone. Talk with everyone.** Be seen - don't just stand around in one place in the corner. Move around and scope the place out, but you sure as hell need to be in the social consciousness of people at the club.
5. **Don't underestimate lines - entrance lines, that is (queues for the brits)**. These are the most boring experiences that are part and parcel of being in a club. Be the group that makes being in a line fun, and you have a ton of cred going for you.
6. **The amount of kino that's acceptable on a dancefloor IF A GIRL IS VIBING YOU is hilariously high.** But, smiling, and laughing at your jokes, you should be escalating like you're trying to reach the moon.

So, and seven girls.

Naturally

Here are the common mistakes that they made (over and over) that you should avoid:

1. **Being seen standing around in the same spot for 20 minutes doing nothing and pointing
2. **When they DID make a move
3. **Anytime you approach a girl and make like it was an accident and then try to finagle your way into talking to her

There was **one guy** who managed to k-close one of my friends, by the way). Informative, I know. 

Don't worry, because my girl and I are into that kind of thing.

**Right:**

* Kino - this guy didn't have any qualms about it.
* Isolation - got our friend away from us with a cigarette break.
* Looks - he was a very put together guy compared to the others who were trying to break in.
* Conversation (?) - she spent a lot of time talking to him. That could be good or bad though.

Now... here's why he didn't get laid

Wrong:

* Was seen orbiting - he was hanging near our group for a good 2-3 minutes before approaching. He at least approached directly
* Did not escalate - beyond basic kino, fine, but then you better isolate and come up with a more fun idea quick, and one where you can ramp up physical/sexual aspects of the interaction.
* Continued to orbit - never did this guy leave our friend's side for the entire hour leading up to last call. I mean, he kinda just hung there looking awkward when she wasn't dancing directly with him.

For serious. If you are pussyfooting in a club, and follow the three second rule. Being blown out is perfectly fine. Shit, take a month to get your first 50 blow-outs so that you get used to it. After you realize that all it means is ""no thank you,"" you can move on with your life and bang a whole bunch of chicks. Sometimes at the same time.

That's it guys, but saying ""you're pretty"" really appreciates her looks in a genuine, honest way. Every time I say this, the girls' eyes light up, they blush and they get a big smile on their face. It also alpha as fuck and clearly states your intentions, what you think of her and appreciates her sexuality.

If you're at a social event and not a party or a club, you're really pretty"", that's it, she will respond with a thank you, maybe brush her hair quickly and you can ask her where she's from what she does etc. If she has an interesting accessory like earrings, a scarf an interesting color or just an amazing dress, you can point that out too, ""Wow

Imagine, because you know you can always come back to her, she has given you the permission to come back with her statement. 

Same goes the other way around, if it's a party, a social event or something else, the girl will search for you, even several times, because she knows every time she finds you again, you will make her feel good. That makes it so easy for you to initiate Kino

Hope some of you can take it up into their repository. :)

It is up to you

Deal with yourself first.  Ask yourself if you truly believe you DESERVE great women in your life.  Ask yourself if you truly believe you are WILL have great women in your life.  If you do not answer affirmatively to both of these questions

Ask yourself WHY you don't believe you deserve to be successful and happy in your dating life.  I've heard and seen all sort of limiting beliefs...

The game is simple. You take turns being Cyrano. Cyrano picks a woman, you win. If you chicken out, you lose.

The lines we use are ridiculous. Anything from ""Have you ever seen a party blaster?"" to ""Listen

The way to win the game, you win. Ideally you want to focus on saying it confidently and alpha, without any care about what the person thinks of you. If they hate you, well, you did in fact just say something weird to them so you shouldn't care. Stay and talk if you feel like it, and push your limits and flirt by all means, but just saying the line is a win.

This game is incredibly fun, and if you really own the line you can generate real attraction. Also, you might find it's somehow EASIER to not feel AA when you're playing this game because the lines are so ridiculous that if you get rejected you can't take it personally.

You can play this with any friend, they get the harmless little vicarious thrill from being part of the single people's single glory.

Two suggestions for when you're the Cyrano. 
1) Pick a hot girl for your friend
2) Pick a line that will embarrass your friend

So next time you're at a bar or concert, or are you gonna be just another greenhorn chump like the rest of them?"" I just made that up now. They don't have to make any sense.

A friend of mine from NYC was visiting Hartford

We get to Hartford and head to a local beer bar. There are no women worth talking to

Around 9:45 we leave to make our way to New Haven. On the way my friend picks up a bag of [Mint Milano cookies.](http://www.pepperidgefarm.com/ProductDetail.aspx?catID=725&amp;prdID=112081) (These will become important in a bit!) We arrive and hit up one of the most pickup friendly venues I know (Cask Republic

We post up at the bar and my friend buys a round of drinks. He is looking good in a suit and tie. There is an intimidating 5-set of absolutely beautiful girls at a table. He says ""I'm gonna do a shot and the go in."" And so he does. He seems to hook somewhat

I sit back at the bar

**Cookies &amp; AMOGs**

As I am sitting there, ""Hey, did you know these come in mint too? My mind is absolutely blown."" The girl smiles and starts talking when the two guys in the back start AMOGing from peanut gallery. **""Come here little girl, I have candy in my van outside,"" they say mockingly.** 

Now

I smile and completely ignore their comment and invite them into the conversation. ""Seriously

The guys look astonished at how smoothly I handled their AMOG attempt. One of them actually takes a cookie. **I literally have them eating out of my hand!** Fuck yeah.

I can see the attraction start to spike from the little blonde. She has that ""Wow

I notice she's not getting service from the bartender, but I think he was watching my pickup attempt and wanted to add a little social proof into the mix. Thanks random bartender!

He then takes both mine and her order. She says ""Put his drink on my tab."" **Fuck yeah! Free drink. I'm so in.** 

I thank her for the drink and she shrugs it off

I sit back, but I think they were out trying to get more social and work on their AA. I have been in his shoes before, so I wanted to give him a very positive interaction. It felt pretty special, for whatever reason.

Anyway, which is close to the bathroom. She is sitting at a table on her double date. I give a very subtle wave and smile. She makes eye contact. I motion towards the bathroom and walk over by it.

No less than 20 seconds later

I quickly get her number and excuse her. My job here is done.

This manifests itself most around girls. I hadn't dated or slept with a girl over a HB5 until 6 months ago and she was a 7 at best. I just run into the problems I'm sure many of you are familiar with: problems talking, the more I struggled the more it fueled my depression. Not a pretty cycle.

Then I found you guys and started reading. What follows is a brief description of my first

I met this girl on OKC, on the other while she had a great body, she had some facial problems(not ugly, just bad skin). But feeling motivated and determined to practice if nothing else, I forged ahead.

After some brief back and forth

At the bar I let her relax a bit and have a couple of drinks before initiating kino. I noticed she had a large elaborate ring on, stopping just short of a k-close, though teasing her, asking if I was going to get a kiss that night. Then I suggested we change venues and go bowling. As we walked out, I could tell she was dying for a kiss, so I purposefully ignored her and walked to my car.

Once we got to the bowling alley, giving long kisses for strikes or spares, and short ones or withholding all together for anything else. By the 4th game she was coming up to me expectantly after she bowled well.

Fast forward through that night to a couple of days later. Again I text her briefly and say I want to see a movie. She suggests Warm Bodies and I give a time and place. We snuggle through the movie and I slowly escalate kino the whole time. By the end my hands are in her pants and she's clinging to my arm. I suggest we get drinks and go back to my place. She quickly agrees and off we go.

Suffice to say, I just can't get over how upset I am about what happened the other day, I don't want to see you anymore"".

Now in the past this is where I would panic, when you change your mind, you have my number"" and sure enough two days later I get a response saying how sorry she was and that she was a moron and wanted me to forgive her. I told her I'd give her another shot and if she impressed me I'd take her back. We went to dinner, SHE actually payed, then back to my place. She just left and I can honestly say that I just had one of the best nights of my life. and I owe it all to you Seddit.

* She is more flirtatious with me. 

* I believe I am more entertaining (more of a confidence booster--just fucking say ""yes

Tonight

**THEN SOMETHING UNBELIEVABLE HAPPENS...** The duty/floor manager comes up behind me while I'm in this two-set and grabs my neck and **DRAGS** me out. At this point I'm like what the fuck. He puts his arm around me and says ""I know what you're doing. I've seen you in here countless times talking to my girls and I don't like it. So if I see it happen again

**ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME???** He then calls me out on using some routines/strategies (which I only use initially in set) and names certain things I have said to chicks over the past few months. He then says something that is absolutely **fucking illogical**...""Girls should be coming up and talking to you

Finally, however I am not reactive and remain civil and personable. I will not drop my value for this jealous loser who obviously has been watching me pick-up countless beautiful women and is too much of a **fucking lethargic pussy** to get girls himself.

The scary thing is that I am genuinely not a loser who will come into the club and be the creepy, assertive men. Not creeps. That's why we're all here. And I successfully reach the ""hook point"" with the large majority of my sets, while also acknowledging that when there is no interest, I should eject the set and ""get back to my friends"".

Truthfully, interesting people. This douchebag is effectively denying me that opportunity.

Not entirely sure what to do this point - this is the club I have had the most success in and I don't want to be banned from there just because I am meeting girls (crazy). It also has the best calibre of girls in my terribly depressing city. Any advice or thoughts on this situation would be appreciated.


**EDIT:** Thanks for your input guys. There seems to be two arguments (both equally valid) - 1) Someone has complained about me talking to girls in the bar

Personally, what I'm going to do is take a break from this location (it's the best bar to meet girls in my city - it's huge) for a couple weeks then go back. And if he still gives me shit then, I might have a word to the GM (only as a last resort). When I go back I will bring girls with me to the club (even pivots) in order to relieve his anxiety about how I'm stealing all his precious girls.

Last week, a 2:1 ratio of guys to girls).  During the 2 or 3 hours I was there, I was probably approached by over 30 girls (maybe around a girl every 10 minutes).  Finally, the shoe was on the other foot, women approaching me!!!  But the sad thing is, it started to get annoying, super annoying.  Why?  Because I was approached in exactly the same way by almost every single girl.

Now bear with me.  I knew all of these girls had an agenda- to get my money (don't we have an agenda when we approach girls?).  And I did end up getting a few lapdances, but it wasn't a major deciding factor).  I realized it came down to who ""seduced"" me the best.  So who failed? 

1.  If she was low energy.  I was having way too much fun with my buds to be dragged down by some boring girl.   -Next

2.  If I smelled an agenda on the girl, I was just a paycheck).  NEXT

3.  If she opened me like every other girl there did, what are you guys celebrating tonight? hey, how long are you in town for?)  BORING!  NEXT

4.  If she commented on my shirt (I was wearing a tuxedo t-shirt because I'm fancy

So the girls that I got dances from?  They didn't approach me like all of the other girls.  They were actually pretty interesting/funny.  They were engaging in conversation (but not too much, but didn't really know why until I realized they were slightly touching my arm or leg.  SEE: kino).  They kept a sexual vibe, but it wasn't overbearing.   It seemed like they were actually connecting with me (I''m in my early 30's, I'm not naive enough to think strippers actually want me, but they charmed me none the less).  

So

Lessons learned:

1.  Differentiate myself from all the other guys in the bar.  Accentuate what make me different/unique.

2.  Don't underestimate the power of kino.

3.  Maintain a sexual vibe

4.  Focus on building rapport and comfort.

1349539639.0,111nf6,3 Steps to Quickly Getting Over Your Ex,TrippAdvice1,490,107,90,"It’s hard to get over your ex and sometimes it takes longer than you’d like. It’s a painful process that many men have to go through. I’ve been there myself and I can say it’s not pretty. I would never wish that pain upon ANYONE. That’s why I have created three easy steps to get over your ex. These are steps that my students and I have taken previously and have worked extremely well.

**1) End all contact**
This is one of the most controversial steps, you must let her know, so she gives you that space. If she continues to contact you, then it will bait you into keeping up contact, which can lure you back in. 

The reason you need to drop contact is because you want to start putting those memories as far into the past as you can. Out of sight, it’s going to take time and time won’t start until you end all contact with her.

• No phone calls

• No texting

• De-friend her on Facebook

• Try and disband from her social group

• Avoid any physical contact at all costs

I can’t stress enough how important this step is in getting over your ex. The sooner you start

**2) Start talking to other girls**
A lot of men wait to date other women after a break-up. I understand that starting to see other women might be tough and remind you of your ex. But my advice here isn’t to necessarily start dating again. If you are ready to date, you have to be reminded that they are all not like your ex. In fact, a lot of men find solace in talking to other women that are the exact opposite of their ex, because it gives them a taste of something new. Start talking to other girls and give your new singlehood the old college try.

**3) Don’t let yourself be alone**
If you want to get over your ex, but you will feel lonelier than ever. That’s what happens when you go through a break-up. Loneliness creeps in harder during this time than almost any other. The way to combat that is to spend time with your friends and family. Forget that you ever dated your ex (at least for these few months that you’re trying to get over her). Here are some other ideas:

• Go out to the bars and clubs

• Volunteer

• Join some meet-up groups

• Run errands even if you don’t need to

• Call some friends you haven’t talked to in awhile

It’s not easy to get over your ex

**1. WHAT IS A ""NICE GUY""?**

&gt; **bash.org:**

&gt; A woman has a close male friend. This means that he is probably interested in her, but I don't like you in that way. This is roughly the equivalent for the guy of going to a job interview and the company saying, You have a great resume, you have all the qualifications we are looking for, but we're not going to hire you. We will, however, use your resume as the basis for comparison for all other applicants. But, we'll hire somebody else

This reasoning is the epitome of ""Nice Guy"" thinking.

Basically a ""Nice Guy"" is someone who wonders why if they are so nice and good to women

Some quotes that are helpful:

&gt; **Vulvarine posted:**

&gt; I think it's really important to distinguish between niceness and kindness. *Kindness is a real

    
&gt; **Ionic posted:**

&gt; One of the keys to understanding the Nice Guy vs. the clueless innocent is that the Nice Guy's definition of himself as such is usually the result of repeated romantic failure and a resulting

&gt; I don't want to make this into more than it is, vulnerable a woman can feel in the face of persistent attention, flattery, and the like. 

&gt; It flies in the face of years and years of social conditioning to tell an outwardly ""nice"" man - one who has in no way technically threatened, I'm not interested."" It's one thing to tell off the drunk who's trying to cop a feel on the subway. But rejecting the friend who just won't stop hanging around looking for more? It's not a simple situation.

&gt; So, we opt for subtlety instead.

&gt; And that's where the real problem with Nice Guys comes in. A regular guy would get the hint, on the other hand, will stick around and attempt to wear you down.  Often Nice Guys will pursue ""'hard luck' cases"" - women who are perhaps not the best-prepared to stand up for themselves. 

&gt; And in the end, his target's shitty taste in men. Because admitting that he wasted his time pushing for something that was clearly never going to happen is just plain cognitively uncomfortable. 

&gt; To sum up, and the NG's persistence in the face of what many other individuals would recognize as subtle signals of mark's disinclination to mate. 

* **1.1 Manipulation**

NG behaviour is manipulative. NGs basically do everything they can to 'make' someone fall for them in an underhanded way. It makes every ""nice"" act revolve around the ulterior goal of getting with 'that' girl. They do it so hard that it becomes a second nature and they're not even conscious of it.

* **1.2 Unrealistic objectification**

NG behaviour ultimately reduces women to objects. While they would vehemently deny it, which blinds them to the fact that these women are independent people. 

* **1.3 Dishonesty**

NGs are not nice for the sake of being nice. They're nice because they think they'll get something in return. Granted that many people behave that way

* **1.4 It doesn't work**

Most women and many men can sense that you're a ""Nice Guy"", Y and Z so if I do that, I'll get laid"", the Nice Guy Technique has appalling success rates.

* **1.5 ""Ugh

Nobody likes assholes, have interesting stuff to say, are attractive or act like actual people instead of a scripted doormat.* Also, maybe her SO is acting hostile towards you because he can sense your true motives. 

* **1.6 Passiveness**

One particular reason why the ""friendship"" between an NG and their 'one true love' or whatever is shallow and questionable is that NGs typically don't go in against their object's opinions (unless their position is threatened somehow)

* **1.7 ""I am nice""**

NGs often describe themselves as being ""nice"", if the first thing that comes up in your mind, or in others' if you need to be described, is ""nice"", then you have a problem because it means you're not particularly seen as having personality.


**2. TYPICAL NICE GUY EXCUSES**

* **2.1 ""But I am genuinely a friend.""**

If you are, but prefer pining in the shadows, bottling up massive frustrations.

* **2.2 ""But in that movie/novel...""**

Popular culture tends to feed the idea that the NG thing is somehow cute, and if you're going to take dating advice from pop culture, well, then I don't know what to say.

* **2.3 ""If she doesn't like it

Nice guys make an advance that cannot be rejected in a socially acceptable way. If a guy says, then it's perfectly socially acceptable to say, ""Nah, I'm not interested."" But instead he might say, ""Oh, you're moving? I'd love to help. When? Hmm, I'm working that day, but I could rent one of those ones from the Home Depot."" Is this guy really helpful just generally, I am honor-bound not to accept your offer of assistance""? Of course not. So you don't say it, you relax a little

* **2.4 ""Welp

Apart from being a non-argument/false dichotomy, but with a mask of niceness. You can certainly be a nice person without the deeper layers of manipulation, self-pity and self-entitlement.

**3. HOW TO SNAP OUT OF BEING A ""NICE GUY""**

* **3.1** Realise that the world doesn't owe you anything

* **3.2** Stop being a passive-aggressive doormat and be more candid about your desires. This will mean having to take rejection

* **3.3** Don't pine. Realise that there are many

* **3.4** Realise that there is no ""manual"" to women, seek therapy.

1289881404.0,e6rtv,Ten Steps to strong inner game. (by me),,465,86,94,"The following ten lessons/tips are all ones I've learned myself during my years of learning seduction. I've gone from pining for a year for an ex girlfriend to having exponentially more confidence and inner strength.  

**1)** Catch yourself every time you make a negative comment or judgement about someone else. Either shut the fuck up about it or rephrase yourself. People are more distrustful of gossips and being negative about others reinforces a pessimistic negative attitude inside yourself. Try and find positive things about other people and it becomes a pattern in your life. If you're thinking about more positive things it makes you into a happier more positive person. Girls want a guy who's fun and happy in himself; they don't want a negative dude who's always bitching or complaining about others. 


**2)** Take your time to realize that things are not as bad as you think they are. I often see dudes on the train stressing out or cussing because the train is late


**3)** Actually fucking listen to stuff other people say and try to understand why they're saying it. If you want to build strong relationships with your lovers and friends and become a real people person, TIME. If someone chooses to be with you, then you better fucking value their choice and listen to what they have to say. People say things for a reason, and it's your duty to listen to them and try to relate it back to them. If you do this you'll find you really start to understand other people and your conversations will be deeper and more meaningful.


**4)** Stop arguing. Put simply, much to  the annoyance of everyone else. I used to do this because I had an argumentative dad and it turned me into a stubborn mother-fucker. I had a revelation when I was 22 and arguing with my girlfriend over doing the fucking dishes. ""Wow, this is completely ridiculous, what a waste of time"". If you ""win"" an argument, you've won nothing; it's a contradiction. Generally what happened is you annoyed someone else and won no friends. Learn to realize when a debate will never end and just LET IT GO. I think actually being able to say: ""actually this is fucking stupid, let's stop arguing"" is a big DHV. 


**5)** Take a few moments each day to remember good shit from your past. Think about the people from your past that you have respect for. Now remember any good things that they said about you or compliments that they gave you. This may be an ex-girlfriend


**6)** ""Everything I do, nothing ever seems to get finished, and you dwell on the future and cannot enjoy the present fully. Take a moment to take a step back and fucking breathe. Don't dwell too much on the future, it will come when it comes but don't let it stress you right now. (Side note: learn to meditate and start doing yoga. These will both help with this step)


**7)** Finish what you start. Get into the habit of finishing each task you start


**8)** Learn shit. Finish that book on psychology or philosophy; the act of learning new things and keeping the brain working seems to have a slowing effect on time. Also, guess what? Girls love this stuff too. Seduction/PUA isn't just about games and tricks and routines, it's also about making yourself into a genuinely interesting and well-rounded individual. Being smart and knowledgable about the world is sexy and powerful.


**9)** Make peace with your past. Come to realize that you cannot change the past. Whatever bad stuff happened to you, the more you dwell on it. Look back at point 2. This comes under the category of ""things you can't control"". If you can't do something about it, and you certainly cannot change your past, then there's no fucking use in worrying about it or dwelling on it. I've found that so many people dwell on bad moments in their past even when they know that these memories make them sad. It becomes a habit and eventually becomes such a part of your character that you're almost afraid to let it go. It's like a safety blanket. It's exactly the same reason why some people who have been overweight for many years find it so hard to lose the weight; it has become part of their identity and losing the weight is almost like killing part of their personality. The thing about this point is that it's suprisingly easy; your mind is under your control. You decide what you think about. If you spend your time thinking about how awesome your ex was and how sad you are; stop fucking thinking about it. Imagine yourself surrounded by smoking hot 9s and being the life of the party. 


**10)** Keep in touch. Stay in touch with your friends. When things aren't going so well, even if it's just a text message or short email. Having lots of friends is a massive confidence booster and also a good friendship network is a gold-mine for meeting new girls. Also the advantage of meeting girls this way is you don't even need an opener and there's zero approach anxiety.

TLDR: Be a man and read it.

1370628057.0,1fvjni,Overcoming a sticking point: Making the conversation a SEXUAL conversation! Some pointers on how to do it.,PUAollie,488,110,129,"I think I've overcome a sticking point recently: getting the conversation to go in a sexual direction. On the last few dates I've gone on

I think part of what was holding me back before was my own mentality of being judged for being some kind of sexual deviant. That

So how does that transfer into dating?

I try to make a point of making the girl realize that I'm a non-judgemental individual. Part of this includes making myself vulnerable. If I'm asked something like ""are you a player?"" I'll almost definitely own up to it. One of my most recent makeouts was right after telling a girl that I'm in ""total manwhore mode in life"". Because I was honest with myself in my intent, and she opened up to me about her being a really horny person in general, which made it really easy to transition into a kiss.

As awkward as you feel about a sexual conversation is how awkward it will be. This also means that if you're totally easygoing talking about sex, jump on that shit. If you see something provocative while you're talking to her, bring it up and discuss! But don't feel weird that you're discussing, because this is NORMAL FOR YOU. I think this falls into the RSD concept of ""Law Of State Transference"". 

On another date I was on earlier this week with someone else, but because I held a casual frame, she became very relaxed about it and then a long sexual discussion began where she opened up about a lot of things like wanting threeesomes, sex on M, etc. Any time she'd say something that lined up with my sexual desires, I'd give her a high five or something similar to give it a casual demeanour. Like ""Yes! I LOVE girls that like aggressive sex! Awesome! (high five)""

So the main points here:

- Be non-judgemental (doesn't mean you can't tease)

- Make yourself vulnerable

- BE CASUAL ABOUT IT

- don't shy away from a chance to bring it up

- Don't let yourself become awkward

- create opportunity for sexual remarks

The whole drive home I felt super embarrassed. I guess I possibly just killed our friendship.  I kept thinking about how stupid I must have looked trying to pull that on her at the end of the night.

But

So, and I am still feeling it now.  But, I know in the long run, I will feel better about taking the chance I did, even if she never views me the same way.  Time to man up and do some approaches.  Good luck to all.

Now go out there and get to work.  I believe in you.

1370842625.0,1g124c,~2 years in. 12 more things I wish I knew.,chazzington,460,93,85,"First off

**State**

State is pick-up chic these days. I see a lot of guys, if the choice between state or no state, choose state. This is part of the distancing from Mystery Method that a lot of places push, and I typically see it come with a lack of entitlement. When I first started going out, I believed that all I needed to bang the girl in front of me was an opener, a hook, and a number close. Now I see people conditioned with this mindset of “no, I need to warm up with 5 sets

Don't ignore the whole concept of state

**How I envision ""the game""**

I see it as a team sport, looks, dress, confidence, body language, opener, how well you hooked her, social proof, you score a lot. Or maybe you're a run/defense based team, it's fine

* (1)  Michael Vick, don't think you can ride solely on them to win a championship. Be balanced.

* (2) She's a different team with different players. You play the Ravens differently than you play the 49ers. Remember

**Self Correction**

Actively make yourself happy, there’s some sort of desire to be “Righteously Angry.” Guys look for reasons to be mad, fume about guys cutting them off in traffic, being mad on the metro, and actively look for reasons to be mad/angry. This is bad, and a chance to self correct your state. Don't be that guy on an airplane looking for someone to bitch about a crying baby. 

**Relationships**

I am in multiple relationships, but women of all different types have been super willing to engage me in an open relationship. 

Don't think ""oh, so she knows what the deal is. You’re busy, not on a date. You’re out with friends etc. I tell them that I am not exclusive with them, but I don’t tell them I’m “fucking” other girls, that’s classless, and a tad bit mean. However, these girls need to know that you have other women waiting and willing. Let other pictures with women show up on your facebook, I had a thing ;)” with a twinkle in your eye. 

**Long term Momentum**
  
Go out often, twice on the same date, where she spent 2 hours dry-rubbing her genitals against mine. The 3rd night, pulled 5 numbers and had 2 f-closes. The 4th night? One of the hottest girls I have ever talked to approached me, opened me, then begged for my number. I was tuned into the right frequency. Stick with it. 
 
**Moving into a natural state**

Be more natural. Try to avoid lines, wonderfully nice, challenging, and sexual, and they have just talked to a lot of people in their life. Like water, let the conversation flow, but direct it.

**Plowing with positivity**

I work with an AMOG. Not your average one, call me ""creepy"" when I'm chatting with girls, etc. He's my favorite guy to go out with, not only because he's challenging, but he's saying this all from a good place, he's just trying to little brother me. I now have him completely pumping up my value to girls through a little bit of basic dog training. Whenever he made a joke I didn't like, I didn't acknowledge it, and he started it
				 
**Other people’s states**
	
Not everyone is in the same state you are. There are the ""law of state transference"" or whatever, you're not a leader to these women yet, and your open might get blown out because they can't properly respond because they are not in the right state. Try going out a few hours later in the night, only an hour or two before close, or on the street in front of a bar. I have literally grabbed girls off the street and walked them into the diner next door. This is what Style meant to say when he said ""sometimes, the 7 hour rule doesn't apply."" Remember, you are playing a team sport against another team.		 
				
**Ecosystems** 

Get a second job that is primarily social. If you live in any big city, street promos, sales, club promoting, bartending, whatever. When you're in a job where you have to preform, or you'll get fired
							
**No matter what

I have a 9-5, and I still go out. You know what dates I've been going on recently? 3 a.m. diner runs after I get off work for pancakes and coffee, also, coffee and reading dates, where I tell them to bring work in the middle of the day. Don't sweat what you do, make sure you bring her into your reality as soon as possible, my reality right now? Reading
				
**Drinking**

Drinking is fine. Being drunk is not. Being poor is not. If you can’t afford to drink? Don’t. Put your money where it is needed, tip the bartender a dollar, and game on. If you can afford to drink? Awesome. Drink, but don’t get sloppy, and don’t get drunk. I firmly believe in mysteries thing on women being attracted to 3 things in a man: (**1**) A protector of loved ones, (**2**) a leader of men, (**3**) Preselected by women. When you’re drunk, but don’t give yourself obstacles.
 			 

**Online game**

1346038188.0,yvwub,"So I ran into my ex today on the street, and subsequently realized that I'm awesome, and seddit helped me learn to be awesome!",,448,93, and we had a ROUGH breakup. 

Anyways, so I tap her on the shoulder, and smile at her and say hi. She half-heartedly waves to me, turns around and keeps walking, not even taking her headphones out. I texted her a bit later saying that I'm sorry she didn't feel like chatting, and I hope she is doing well.

Some people would be sad or distraught...not I. I let her keep walking tonight

Right after that harsh breakup, got in better shape, started eating better, started going to therapy (this was big for me, I have C-PTSD), kept my room cleaner, started dressing better, and I'm happy and comfortable with myself, it just shows that she isn't a very nice or forgiving person, because that's something that happened between two emotional

Seddit is a huge part of what encouraged me to make all those positive changes in my life and learn to be comfortable with myself while also improving myself, which is self-improvement and being awesome. Because of you guys, something that would have made me feel horrible before just made me feel more awesome about myself. People go to r/breakups or r/relationships to get over a breakup, and I seriously don't know why, because what I learned here is 100x better than anything I could learn by wallowing in those places and fixating on the past. This subreddit is about the future, my awesome future, and things I can do to make it better, I was just my normal

Also the fact that I had hot sweaty sex with a much better looking girl last night doesn't hurt :).

**EDIT: Thanks for all the critiques and compliments people, the inistial approach, I do initiate conversations with people, even those who I've had falling outs with, because I don't like having enemies, this is to demonstrate that I have no ill will towards them. I've done this before with ex-friends and will keep doing it if I run into someone I knew before, because people do tend to grow up bit by bit and it's definitely worth it to check in and see how they are doing, for me

So what exactly is “nice guy syndrome”? For starters


•continually asking for permission 

•always at someone’s beck and call

•never saying what you want

•worrying what people think of you

•consistently walking on egg shells

•fearing rejection


So how do you change it?

**START BEING OUTCOME INDEPENDENT**

Easier said than done


•Tell a woman how you feel.

•Do something for yourself.

•Take up space.

•Stop worrying.


**YOU DON’T HAVE TO BE AN ASSHOLE TO ATTRACT WOMEN**

Start having an “edge”. Instead of being the boring

-Find a new hobby.
-Buy something you’ve never bought before.
-Take a chance on something new.
-Tell the girl you like that you’re into her.

Once you do that

**TL:DR** - See title.

1366758991.0,1cyybv,"College FR: ""Hey, could you watch my things for a minute? I'll be right back.""",proman3,452,91,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/1cyybv/college_fr_hey_could_you_watch_my_things_for_a/, get some water, the stage is set perfectly to ask something about what class they're waiting for or whatever.

This particular line is kind of specific to college campuses, it is because, generally, people love to have debts owed to them WAY more than favors done for them. Favors put the thought of ""Shit, how am I gonna pay this back?"" in the favoree's head, which is largely an uncomfortable feeling to have. No one like's being in debt for anything, and if the payment is optional (like the debt of a favor), it will never be returned. 

Thanks to this notion, why the hell would I want to chill with a girl who's too uptight to watch over someone's things for a few minutes?) Has anyone else noticed this phenomenon, though?

1334420960.0,s9m4b,The Definitive Guide To Confidence,,434,73,38,"""Just don't give a fuck.""  

""Fake it 'till you make it.""

""Just do it brah

----------
Confidence.  It's what so many seek, have a gigantic penis, and be [swimming in money like Scrooge McDuck](http://tattoosales.files.wordpress.com/2010/08/blog13.jpg)

If you're not confident

Let's pull back and talk about what confidence is. 

If you want the TL;DR:
 **Confidence is you respecting yourself.**

It's that simple.  How can you expect anyone to respect you if you don't even respect yourself?

That's what is at the core of confidence.  You need to respect yourself to a level that others pick up on this and respect you.  That doesn't mean be intimidating and arrogant.  It means you need to intrinsically know that you are worth something.  

I'll spin this a different way.  


**What is a social interaction if not a presentation of yourself?**  How can you properly present a product that you have no confidence in?  You can't.  Go try to sell someone a sports car without wheels.  Exactly.  That's what a great person without confidence is.  Almost all of the pieces are there

See what I'm getting at here?


To have confidence you need to respect yourself. 

So why don't do you respect yourself?  Are you too skinny?  Too fat?  Not well-read? You're your own biggest critic and judge.  Figure out what you don't like.  Fix it.  Whether you need to go to a gym, learn a musical instrument, or anything else, figure out why you don't have confidence.



*Now let's talk about generating this confidence.  I'll even give you a shortcut*

""Just don't give a fuck, and instructing someone to do that first is going about it backward.  Confident people just don't give a fuck.  If you're not confident, it's really hard to just flip that switch and start giving fewer fucks.  Rather than saying ""just don't give a fuck,""  you need a reason not to give a fuck.  If you're interesting, if you respect yourself, and you demand the respect of your peers through your very presence, you will have confidence.  

*But let's talk about a shortcut*

That's right

You'll see a lot of posts on here advocating ""just have a goal of having fun for the night.""  More often

Be interesting.  Because you're so damn interesting you'll be confident.  Remember how confident the most interesting man in the world is?  Be that interesting


*This last bit is the most important part. * 

What is confidence?
A confident person respects himself.  That internal confidence is radiated outward

How do you get confidence?
By knowing you intrinsically have value.  Fix your flaws.  Become interesting.  Have enough life-experiences that you're awesome and you know it.  

-----------------------

Good luck.  Hopefully this helps.

I've never been good with women. I've had a few relationships

I was taught by my parents to respect women as complete equals. This is a large part of my problem. I have been lurking here for the better part of a month now and I hate the large majority of the advice you give. I know someone who is the embodiment of everything this reddit promotes, aggressive etc. etc. Hes incredibly successful socially and with women. 

I would like someone to kill this man. Hes always around since hes my roomate's best friend. I simply can't take the advice that you should assert your will over others

I came here wanting nothing more than to improve my skills with women to the point that I could talk to people and maybe secure a girlfriend if an appropriate candidate ever came along, but I won't sacrifice the things that make me who I am for it.

Bring on the downvotes but I felt that I needed to share this. 



**Edit: Didn't expect such a response! I'm going to go ahead and try and answer the consensus of what people are saying since there are a whole lot of you commenting.** 

My problem is more with the kind of advice that is given across all situations. I don't like the way I have to respond. The link in the right to shit tests is a good example. All of the ""Alpha"" responses, even when they flit through my head during conversation and are particularly witty. 

Alot of you guys have assumed that I am a weak sensitive nice guy. Thats partly true, but I am not weak. The alpha male I mentioned before (Mike) has incredible social standing in our dorm/social community. I disagree with Mike on fundamental levels that make our personalities fundamentally incompatible. I have stood up for myself plenty of times in front of people who would all have his back if he were to try something. I have threatened to kick him out of my room when he has said particularly nasty and immoral things about me and other people. I'm certainly not weak, I assure you this. 

Another thing alot of commenters are saying is that I don't have to be an ass in order to be good with women. It seems to me that certain responses and mindsets given in this subreddit are bad. I don't like egotistical replies, that would violate my own ideas of what being an equal is.

I get there and it's awkward as anything.  I don't know anyone

The boring people start to leave and we make our way to a bar.  I finally start to socialize more, douchbag comes in and steals Redhead away.  I'm choked.  People start to console me.  They can see that I have oneitis for this girl.  That I'm a little bitch!  


My mindset changes and I leave the bar with a cool couple and their friends to go to another location.  At this point I'm pretty drunk because I haven't eaten and have been drinking for 7 hours.  I also am now solely with people I met that night.  

We go to this new location and I immediately start introducing myself to new people.  My social energy is skyrocketing.  I meet this girl and we hit it off.  I take her hand and bring her to the bar for a drink and to get some 1on1.  Some asshole comes out of nowhere and steals her away quickly.  I see she isn't down with this guy so i say, maybe he was talking to her earlier, I don't know but he says, No she isn't, prove it.  I look at HB7 and smile, silently letting her know what's coming.  She smiles back and I go for the kiss.  We don't look back at the dude.  After that she was mine, and I knew it.  We ended up at her place and fucked twice that night and once again in the morning.  Later on I found out she works with Redhead.  

This experience taught me a lot.  I've been much more confident lately.  Since then

Another fun thing:
I puked on HB7's bathroom floor.  Lol what a tool, I just vomited.  She says she knows.  I tell her I made a mess.  She says thats okay.  I ask her to grab some mouthwash and join me in the shower.

Note: Section 1 is written in a way to give you a mental image of the man you will become as you progress in your self-development. Revisit this post often

---

*Buckle up and get ready for the ride of your life. Embrace and practice the steps in these nine sections and you will become the man you've always wanted to be. What follows is a glimpse into your future...*

---

**1) You cherish women.**

You are genuinely delighted by women. You cannot help but celebrate their beauty. You aren't afraid to show flashes of vulnerability - you are the ""bad boy with a heart"" that women fantasize about. You have incredible love and compassion towards women, loved and beautiful.

**2) You have a purpose in this life beyond her.**

You are on an eternal journey towards greatness. When you meet a beautiful woman

**3) You understand that honesty is the greatest aphrodisiac.**

With great power comes great responsibility. You understand to your core that her heart will be broken if she ever feels manipulated by you. You literally have the power to color all her future interactions with men. As such

**4) You make no apologies for who you are.**

You make no apologies for your values, or your desire. You avoid verbally defending yourself when challenged or tested, because to defend it is to validate it. You base your entire existence in honest intent. You need not apologize for nor justify anything in your life, as long as it comes from a place of authenticity.

**5) You never take things too seriously.**

You are immensely confident, and the situation. You live a life of self-amusement. You have no qualms being self-deprecating in your humor as appropriate. You are a master of the trollface. Your confidence will shine through. All around you will know that you are a [modern alpha male](http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/fobhj/lesson_1_primer_on_being_a_modern_alpha_male/). You are used to winning on an epic scale.

**6) You are a master of body language.**

You've studied body language in detail. You've practiced and dedicated hundreds of hours perfecting your craft. When you approach a woman, eye-contact, and taking up space. Tales of your presence will be heralded for all ages.

**7) You've eliminated all limiting beliefs from your life.**

You understand the difference between ""good-looking"" and ""attractive"" to your core. You make no excuses for your faults and succeed in spite of them. You've been handed the blueprint for success and you've used it.

**8) You are unique.**

You have eclectic interests, everyone you encounter in life will think, ""Wow, who is this man? There's something about him...""

**9) You've eliminated mediocrity from your life.**

You fully understand that women are sick of mediocre men. You have taken steps to remove all mediocrity from your being. You've transcended what you ever thought was possible.

---

**Action Items**

1) Go someplace relaxing where you can be all alone. Bring a pen and a notebook. Ponder deeply and visualize the man you want to be 90 days from now. Catalog your life and remove anything and everything that doesn't fit this new image you have for yourself. Write this all down.

* Examples: Stop wasting time playing pointless video games

2) Identify what behaviors you need to add to your life to become the man you hope to be in 90 days. Add them immediately.

1370452593.0,1fqdfc,Girl's perspective: how to avoid needy/clingy girls,Unisuccess,499,147,132,"Guys often bring up needy/clingy girls as a big turnoff but I feel many times

If a girl is desperate with everyone

But from my own experience and observations of friends, etc. when the guy shows mixed signals. Obviously a girl who is really strong would just end it but girls tend to hang on when they feel there's some hope he's interested. 

**Mixed signals include:**

- Treating her really nice

- Taking less initiative than before but still seeming very interested when she talks to you

- etc. etc.

Most of the time, playing the field or not sure what he wants. But girls tend to want exclusively dating early on, if she likes you and especially after you guys have sex.

So if you are still keeping your options open

Being honest about your feelings and what you want is something that both guys and girls struggle with because we all like to have the safety net of backups or to keep options open if we change our minds. 

But our behaviour actually ruins the dating experience for both people. We can make the other person desperate

**Bottom line:**
When someone starts to act desperate/clingy, be honest. You're acting based on a ""scarcity mindset"" to need to keep people you aren't that into around. ",,False,,t5_2qhrv,False,,

1359568282.0,17klsb,[FR] What turned out to be the wildest night of my life. (The following weekend/Update) ,KaptainKid,449,99,163,"A couple weeks ago I made a post entitled ""Somewhat of an FR"" and ended it with a cliff hanger so to speak. Someone asked me how it went so I figured I'd type up an FR about the following weekend.

If you didn't see my other post, block print. I ended up getting her number and made plans to hang out with her back at my dorm a couple days later. And that's when the greatest sexual fantasy of my life started to be built.

We ended up not hanging out those couple days later, or so it seemed, and I was feeling great.

Friday night came and I was ready to go. I recapped some of my favorite shit tests here from Seddit, and slapped confidence all over myself. I drove over to her place and met up with her and her friends. They had already started pre-gaming and I had already established that I wasn't going to drink and be DD. I didn't want alcohol to be my crutch that night, this was going to be my night. I wanted to wake up in the morning and say ""I did ALL that in a natural state"" and know that I have the ability and confidence to do what I did with every girl.

So after about 30 minutes of chilling at her place, walked in and it was on. I had the biggest smile on my face, stood up tall (I'm 6'5 and often times slouch a little), and started greeting people I had never even seen before. It caught everyone's attention. People were coming up to me later and introducing themselves. Most of these guys being football players, we talked our college athletics. A couple of girls approached me as well. I didn't initiate any kino with them, but I did however flirt a little as my date that night watched. I kept eyeballing her to read her body language. I could tell she was digging the fact that a lot of people we're attracted to me and I was hers that night. After about 5 to 10 minutes of conversation, I grabbed my dates hand and said, but I didn't care. I was on a natural high and completely sober

I have to add that this girl has ass for days

We danced a little while longer then she took a break to go check on her friend who was absolutely obliterated drunk. This was a good time for me to get some water and mingle with other people. Met a couple other guys who said I looked to be having a damn good time and even asked for some poitners. People asking **ME** for pointers? What in the flying fuck was going on?!?! That's when it hit me. All of this was happening because of confidence. Literally

She came back and wanted to dance a little more, we made out for about 5 minutes. I was purposely waiting for her to make the move cause I had a pretty good shit test I wanted to use. After we got done kissing I facepalmed and she asked what was wrong. I told her my girlfriend would be so disappointment in me right now. Guys, the look on her face was priceless. It was a literal Kodak moment, folks. She looked like she had just seen a ghost.
I quickly exclaimed ""PSYCH!"" and she playfully smacked me and laughed and yelled ""That's so not funny!!!"" Then she grabbed me again and pulled me in. She whispered, I would have fucked her right there, I didn't care. Things were getting pretty heated until some jackass decided to come down the stairs to go outside for a breather and stepped on us. Given, we were on the dark, secluded stairs, so I can't get too pissed.

We got up and hung out at the party for about another hour. There was a girl fight (which was pretty badass) and the cops showed up twice, we talked for a little bit about school, sports, the night, everything. We made out a little bit more as well. I was completely content with not laying into her that night if the opportunity didn't present itself. I had already broken my wall of AA down completely and took the tips I had learned here and put them into practice.

Who was I kidding....
I was as hard as a box of jawbreakers. Fuckin' A I was going to lay into her. I had done so well all night and this would be the icing to the cake. All I needed was the invite to stay the night. I simply told her it was cold so let's take out kissing inside where it's warm. She agreed so we moved inside. Her roommate was in on the couch asleep so I said ""Looks like your bedroom will have to do, ""Let me see what'cha got!"" I took that as a challenge and took it to her room. 

I want to stop here and inform you all that I hadn't been laid in almost a year. My game was being completely reconstructed. Even when I was getting laid, just basic, missionary position sex.

I didn't realize what I had gotten myself into. I had found a flower in a garden of weeds and I was about to find out why I think that now.

We made out on her bed for about 30 minutes as our hands explored each other. I was so ready to go, still teased her and kept acting like she wasn't going to get anything. This drove her wild, guys! Try it sometime. Let me remind you, she's sobered up by now and she wasn't trashed to begin with, just a little tipsy. 
At the beginning of the night she had told me ""I'm not gonna be as easy as you think"" and winked at me. Sooooo to reciprocate, pinned them behind her head and whispered ""Whoa, whoa, whoa, I'm not gonna be *'that easy'*"" and started kissing her neck. Her body started to contort in ways I had never seen before. She was so ready to go and I wasn't sure how much longer I could resist. 

I went down, I know, bras can be tricky) and started nibbling a little bit. She couldn't handle it any longer. She ripped her pants off, ripped my shirt and pants off and I went down to eat her out. I incorporated some techniques I had heard on /r/sex and they worked like a charm. She was drenched, I was rock hard, shit was about to get fuh-reaky!

Then it hit me......
Holy shit. No. What the fuck. What was I thinking, that would make sense). I whispered to her, ""I don't have a condom."" I was super hesitant about saying this thinking it would kill everything that just happened. She chuckled and comically shook her head and replied with, ""Boy, I'm on the shot. Please, just plow me""

WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO! Fireworks went off in my head/testicles. The one thing every guy hooking up with a girl wants to hear. I was about to go bareback on this HB9. 

We went on to have the wildest

I was in paradise. We were being serenaded by The Weeknds ""Trilogy"" album and sweating like apes. We went at it for a good two hours **at least**. We both got off a good 3 or 4 times. It was completely and utterly in tents. We still have sexy times every now and then and it's a damn good time


Here's why all of this happened:

1. You guys. Seddit. You guys gave me so many good tips to do that actually work. I love you guys.

2. Confidence! I know everyone says it, miraculously, YOU FEEL GOOD. Go out and not care. Be a boss, tell yourself you're fuckin awesome, whatever you have to do to make yourself feel good and be in a good mood. Forget the world and your problems that night and focus on the prize.

3. I was myself. When you're being yourself in your own skin


Thank you Seddit for everything and taking the time to read this if you did. I tried to cover everything as best I could. Good luck to everyone on their game!

1354777847.0,14dgcl,[FR] Successful Cold Approach in Class and Why You Should Read Field Reports,browsci,426,80,81,"Last week in my large lecture class

I come early to class today to scope out the situation, she enters, sits down, and I am quick to follow. She sits down with her female friend directly to her left. A guy is entering the row and I am worried sick that he might take the seat to her right. Thankfully, he continues further into the row, leaving me with the golden opportunity.

I sit next to her and am about to begin a conversation, why would she want to talk to me anyway?, I must be a moron... the usual stream of approach anxiety. I feel like no matter how fast my heart is pumping me with oxygen, it's not enough. Before I can come to my senses, class begins, she is diligently taking notes, I might be on the verge of cardiac arrest

Halfway through the lecture, I have succeeded. I KNOW I will be infinitely happier with a rejection than having not tried. No matter how many times you can say this to yourself and understand it rationally, you need to practice at it so it becomes internalized emotionally. The first times are very difficult but you have to dive into it like a cold pool before you get over approach anxiety. I'm still in the early stages of this but the improvement is already noticable.

I recall this [field report that I read](http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/10mve2/fr_class_game_number_close/) and decide to use the same strategy. I scrawl a tic-tac-toe board and make my first move. I close my eyes and take a deep breath. I nudge her elbow with my elbow (kino anyone??), until it's clear that we're going to tie (of course). She whispers ""it always ends in a tie."" I overtly cheat, I erase her last ""O"", substitute an ""X,"" and suddenly I'm the winner. ""Not today,"" I said, and showed the paper to her. Another giggle. There are about 10 minutes left in the lecture. Now I wait

Class ends and once we are packed up, look her in the eyes, and say ""I know this is out of the blue, but do you want to get coffee soon?"" (I am curious whether prefacing it with an acknowledgement that my request is random is OK or if I should just jump to the question. Maybe it doesn't matter.) Inside I am already ecstatic, relaxed, and feel as though I don't even care what her reply is-- I did the impossible-- I asked out this random hot girl I was fawning over. She seems happy and says ""Of course!"" Mind you, this is basically our FIRST verbal interaction. We exchange digits and I go on my way.

This will be brief but hopefully help those of you

Let me the first person to tell you

I am often reminded of the story I read randomly from some romanticism literature i picked up in a library. 

The story was a medieval piece  about a princess who collected knights from all around to come and carry out the tasks of the kingdom in hopes of one day gaining her love. 

There were dozens of knights

Each task became more difficult and challenging to the knights resolve. The weak fell fast and soon there was only one knight. When he was left as the final champion he approached the princess for her final task. Her Final task she stated was 'You may never talk to me again I never wish to have a partner
The knight

Now romantic literature always had that twisted plot
In mine the knights says, and leaves. The princess was left confused and dishearten, how could someone so loyal and so good disobey her?

The kingdom

She sent out a request for the knight to be back. He was now in the position of control. 

Now you as the reader can take this in several ways. You can take it as being that best friend to the girl you like and staying in her life on her demands

This story is a classic example of the push pull attraction but reversed, but with out him being apart of it.

Now the push comes when he leaves. By telling the princess, because how could someone so faithful turn and leave me like its nothing. 

Now this is what you need to do if you find yourself in a situation with a girl that isnt what you want. Be able to walk away as if it were nothing. She treated you poorly

Because only once you have lost everything are you free to do anything. 
Tyler Durden

For me this has always been a tough issue, maybe things will work out. 

It never does. The Friendszone is a comfy place to be

Think of the positives

In this way you can be direct again. And being direct is the essence of becoming attractive. 

There have been several times in the last few months where things werent working out, but my heart tells me i have more feelings than what we have, and right now you are not able to meet them, so i feel like we should end things, so i dont lead you on or mix our feelings and hurt you.

Now by saying this i have used language to make it sound as if im in control

Now i was faced with some intense repercussions and spiteful responses from a few of the girls

'Thanks for being honest""

Now 80% of my cuts have had girls texting me

The other girls, shy girls have great personalities too, but they too have the ability to lead you on. Now for those, after a month or so, you may be able to reconnect on your own. 

The best way to reconnect if you are attempting too, and not a look of desperation or regret by you connecting again. 

Now if you dont think you will see her again

If not, and hobbies. 

Sorry if this reads a bit funny

It started with the (relatively innocuous) mistake of playing the ""who's the hottest girl you know"" game on facebook

* Her saying some of the girls I'd hooked up with were beat (true)
* Her saying I therefore had no game
* Her expressing her curiosity as to how I ever hit on girls

Fastforward to this weekend, and dresses like he belongs on the cover of GQ. To top it off, he's from England and has the accent! For fuck's sake!

We're all sipping our drinks and my two roommates start lamenting the dating scene here

Mind you I have absolutely zero interest in hitting on girls at this point. This community (among other things) got me a girlfriend who is absolutely perfect for me. Still, and a 4 (tall skinny black haired Eastern European, tall thick blonde, average size brunette).

My line? ""Hi. We're here to hit on you."" (Massive grin)

I could see minds being blown. My roommates stood agape. The girls started laughing immediately and asked not our names but who we were (a subtle but I think important distinction). One of them exclaimed it was ""the most direct thing she's ever heard from a guy, dropped a ton of ""who gives a fuck, this is hilariously absurd"" lines, including:

* ""OK
* ""You in the back
* ""We obviously just made your day.""

The game ended when I automatically put my hand on the small of one of the girls' backs (the cynical one, watching the events unfold, the entire time.

I ran off to console her that I really wasn't interested and it was all a big show, for the love of god, don't touch other girls. Don't do it. Even if your girlfriend tells you she thinks you suck at picking up chicks. Even if she eggs you on. Even if she thinks she can handle it. 

Postscript: after I left the group one of the girls told me roommates

EDIT: I just want to clarify that this was a playful interaction (for the most part) with me and my long term girlfriend.

I guess I will start at the beginning.  Me and a few long time friends were having a good night in a local college town.  We went out for a great steak dinner

There were few people at the house to begin with around 10pm, it was 11, and the house was almost full.  A few people peeled off to grab more drinks, while me and the rest of the owners of the house went back inside to entertain the guest.

That's when I saw my prey for the evening.  Tall woman in a little black dress.  Had a volleyball player's body.  Long brown hair down to the small of her back.  Big eyes and a beautiful smile.  When I saw her

Her feet.  If you are having a conversation with someone and their feet are facing you directly, even better.  If they face away from you, then you have not captured attention.

I went over there, ""hey baby, sorry it took me so long. who's this?"" She played along long enough to dismiss this struggling PUA, then turned her attention to me.  We laughed and had a good time for a while, discussing how she actually did play volleyball.  I joked with her giving her reasons to date a volleyball player (Good on their knees, good with balls, etc.)

Everything was going great, I took a step in closer, placed my palm on her cheek, and turned her head back at me, saying, ""I'm much more interesting than whatever is over there sweetheart.""

Her eyes.. oh god her eyes.  She gave me the eye fuck

Next move?  Leave.

I love playing hot and cold.  Right after this, then grabbed my phone, saying that my other friends were back with more drinks and said that they needed help.

Went to find my other friends, staring right at me, waiting for my return.  Ohhhhhhh boy.  

We were running low on ice, and whispers, ""I'm much more interesting than your friends, don't you think?"" 

We make out.  She runs her hands down my chest right to my belt buckle.  Then she stops

Counter hot and cold with hotter and colder?  Sneaky lady.

At first, and understood her game.  It was beautiful.  Smart and beautiful.  A real HB.  

I go and drop off the ice downstairs, and have pretty much friend zoned each other.  So there is no sexual tension between us really.  But I don't mind.  All I need is my HB to see me talking to another woman and she will go bat shit.

Before I know it, I shit you not, channeling my inner Tony Stark.

HB: ""You are just like all the other cute guys I have met here.""

Me ""I guarantee you I am nothing like them.  Much more charming

HB: ""Oh very funny.  You must play girls like me all the time

Me: ""As much as I can.  Hopefully two or three a night.  Any less is a disappointment.""

HB: ""And you must not lose an hour of sleep at night do you?""

***WARNING: MOVIE QUOTE/KNOCKOUT PUNCH INCOMING***

Me: ""I'm prepared to lose a few with you tonight.""

Stopped her dead in her tracks.  My lady friend I was talking to didn't know what had just happened.  HB cracked a smile, ""Take me back to your place.""

**FRIDAY NIGHT**

Guy #1 texts a bunch of people asking where the party is. He gets no responses. He calls someone at 10PM. It's loud and they're at a bar. He wonders why he never got a text back about the bar in the first place.

**FRIDAY NIGHT**

Guy #2 has texts from 3 guys and 1 girl all inviting him out to different parties and bars. He heads to a bar with a co-worker for happy hour drinks. He rushes home to get showered and changed before having his pick of which parties to hit up. He gets a few texts from guys asking where the party's at. He decides not to respond because he's going out with a few guys already and doesn't want the boy:girl ratio to get thrown off. He gets a call at 10PM from one of those guys and feels bad he didn't text him back.

---

Why is Guy #2 getting invites while Guy #1 gets ignored?

It comes down to one simple concept: **GIVING VALUE.**

Guy #2 is outgoing. He's fun. He focuses on having a good time. He is not concerned about approach anxiety because he's out to have fun first and get laid second. Girls open him when they see him having such a good time. Guy #2 often invites other value givers to do things with him.

Guy #1 shows up alone or with other guy friends. He has high approach anxiety and it shows on his face. He is visibly uncomfortable and nurses his drink all night. He doesn't go out of way to speak to others. He goes home alone. Guy #1 often texts other guys (who he knows go out a lot and meets women) asking where the party's at. He often gets ignored.

If you relate to Guy #2

If you relate to Guy #1

""Giving value"" can be as simple as:

* telling funny jokes
* coming up with fun things to do
* being very good-looking or dressed very well
* buying or bringing drinks/drugs/etc.
* bringing women
* being an awesome wingman
* pushing people out of their comfort zones
* the ability to get over one's approach anxiety

Introduction: Last week I met this French guy at a party. We went out on 2 dates, he f-closed me on the first one. His game was really natural so I paid close attention to what he did.

We met at a party where I got really drunk and (apparently) we made out. But because I blacked out

So the next day I added him on Facebook, we could go out for drinks. He also mentioned something specific that we talked about at the party (something like, ""then you can tell me more about the story of the butterfly""). Now that impressed me. I thought, ""this guy *listened*"". So maybe you can do that when you ask someone out after meeting them. 

Now, and when we got to the restaurant, his friends were waiting. But we sat next to each other, on one corner of the long table, and we talked mostly by ourselves. When we got our drinks, he asked if he could taste mine. I thought it was pretty intimate, but because he asked

He sat himself in a way that he was partly facing me. Whenever I looked at him to say something or answer a question, and express agreement or suggest something that I should see or do, related to the topic at hand.

While we were eating

So he's isolated me. He said, talking and giggling, him kino-ing a bit by touching my hair, my cheek and kissing me lightly on the lips. 

We found a place to have a beer. When we sat down, and I didn't protest. He continued to kino by running his fingers up and down my arm, holding my hand, and he escalated to kissing me on the neck and rubbing my back and waist, until eventually he went on to lightly caressing my inner thighs and putting his hand up my (short) skirt. By this time he was whispering things in my ear like ""I really want you to come home with me."" He didn't ask, he was definite about what he wanted.

I would have gone home with him that night, he told me he would really like to see me again (preferably the next day). I could come with him to this party or something. I didn't end up going, but we set up a date (via text) for the day after. This time I brought my toothbrush. :)

Now you might say I was already attracted to this guy. But remember, I was a virgin until I slept with this guy. So KINO, KINO, KINO. Escalate, escalate, escalate! And keep your interaction playful, light, try not to use canned lines. Listen carefully

TL;DR: Pay attention. Be confident. Be sexual early.

Hope this is helpful for someone. I read a post earlier asking if kino was still necessary even if attraction is already strong. So I decided to post this FR. (In short

""Next time you go out ANYWHERE (which you should do right now), then you analyze how it felt.  Feeling game for a couple more hi's?  Great, go for it!  Felt too easy?  Escalate to asking them a question / starting up a very small conversation.  Felt nerve wracking and awkward?  That's fine, you accomplished your goal.  Go home, you're a winner, and repeat day after day until it becomes easy, then escalate.""

I feel that this is a great first step for introverts.  This is essentially the smallest first step one can take

Well

1343749786.0,xgc3u,I was trying to just mess with people and ended up somehow pulling in an HB7...,ishitinhammocks,458,113,90,"This happened this past weekend and to be honest I have no idea how.  I went to a house party and felt like messing with people.  So I get to this party that my friend invited me to.  I was in the mood to just fuck around and just mess with people.  


So there is this guy and girl making out right next to a high traffic area.  So I go up to them and just stare.  I keep a dead serious look on my face and just stand there slowly sipping my beer.  I do this because they where in a high traffic area.  I mean at least find a dark corner or something.  So after about 45 seconds or so (I guess they where really into each other) they turn to me and the girl says ""wow...you're creepy.""  


I looked her dead in the eye and managed to pull off a tear and tell her that I was sorry.  I then went onto this elaborate story of how I was 22 and had never been kissed.  I tell her how I was just curious and got lost in the moment of their passion.  At this point her guy friend is even feeling bad for me.  He chimes in ""Dude...how have you never kissed a girl before?  You're a good looking guy!  Try to talk to people and not just stand quietly and creepily at a party.""  I then told them that I tried to talk to girls but they usually cuss me out or throw their drink at me.  They looked really confused and asked what I was saying to these girls.  

So still holding this fucking perfect straight face I look them dead in the eye and say ""Well

I turn to the guy and just say ""Man

At first she looked kind of offended because of this deception.  So then I look at her and say ""You can be offended and not talk to me anymore or we can hang out some more.  I don't care either way.""  Her friend just shrugged and HB7 agrees to talk to me/make out for a while in the corner.  After about 15-20 minutes of that my friends tell me it's time to go.  She gives me her number with out me needing to ask and I walk off with my friends.  As I was leaving I ran into the first guy who gave me a handshake and told me he thought my act was really believable and hilarious.  My friends also got a kick out of the story.

**TL;DR** I stared creepily at this guy and girl.  Told them I was a virgin and had never been kissed.  Girl brings me her HB7 friend whom makes out with me.  I tell girl truth when she says I'm really good at kissing for my first time.  HB7 gives me number.

1322283381.0,mpl2e,Stop caring about outcome -&gt; Entertain Self,testmypatience,398,55,78,"Stop caring all together about the outcome. Only do it because you want to entertain yourself. Eventually your subconsious will pick up things that are working. Never ever care about outcome at all. The only outcome is that you have done something. 

Let me give you some examples.

I was out with a friend last week and I told him to challenge me to anything. I wanted to just do something. He told me to go ask a girl if I could wear her scarf. Not the normal kind of scarf either. It was the flight attendant kind. I was like... hm... I would look retarded but who gives a fuck. Challenge accepted. I got a funny conversation out of it

I asked an older gentleman if I could have some of his popcorn because I was too lazy to get my own. I actually said that lazy part too. I got a funny conversation that ended up with him telling me he was a huge part in making the clubs around town and was looking to train a protege for the lighting stuff they put into clubs. 20 bucks an hour too. Do you realize how much social networking that gig would get me? I have kids so I won't be able to do it but I got my buddy on it. All because I said something stupid on purpose. 

I am looking to get a rise out of people for my entertainment. Sometimes it is a negative and sometimes it isn't. Honestly if the people are cool people you are going to get them joking back. Those are the people I want to talk to anyhow. 

* I ask blondes what their normal hair color is. That actually has always resulted in a postive conversation.

* I asked a group of girls if they wanted to have an orgy. That was a fun and positive conversation.

* I asked a girl if she was drunk enough to go home with me yet. Good conversation.

* I asked an asian girl if she wanted to go to a chinese buffet sometime. She said that we should.

Stop caring all together. If you care you will fail. The reason for people taking so long learning a new language? They are fearful of failing every single time they try a new word or sentence. They are even affraid of that in front of themselves. If you truely just give the fuck up caring you will enjoy yourself. 

**Life - You have non-refundable tickets to it.** Don't waste them. They were free but you never get them back when you die. They just keep on expiring as you get older and pass up the moments the tickets were for. Don't do that.

EXTRAS

**Someone has to be the leader in your life. It should be you.** For trivial things in life you should not let others dictate what you do. Just do things. If the outcomes bug you then stop doing what it was that fucked you over. If you enjoy the outcomes then keep doing it. Just do stuff. You don't have much time so just do it already. Nobody is going to live your life for you. Most sucessful people lead their own lives and don't have others lead them. Be a leader of your own life.

**Treat life like a new video game when you go out.** If you are a gamer you probably go try the new weapons

**Who the fuck knows what is going to come out of what you put in.** Just keep shoving shit into the input and see what comes out the output. After a while you will get a good pattern and can just use that. You will disregard the crap and still keep pumping out new results. You can the trash and keep the good and keep on trucking. Who the fuck cares about garbage. It is garbage. NEXT that shit and just keep on keeping on and eventually you will be like

EDIT 2:

I want to share with you that since this epiphany I have been changing my rationality from: ""What is going to happen? *old shitty worrysome answer*"" to ""What is going to happen? *Who cares I only get this chance once so who gives a fuck.*""

When you start answering your worries this way you can rationalize almost any crazy action. So unless you have a solid answer of why you shouldn't the default should start being  ""**Who cares I only get this chance once so who gives a fuck.**""

1369584555.0,1f33mq,[FR] F-closed a random girl I took a photo for on a night out thanks to simple tips from Seddit.,cruisingthrulife,432,93,93,"I'm a pretty recently new reader of Seddit, and it worked very well! 

*Also apologies for the wall of text

So I went out with some friends (2 other guys, and this is where it all began. At first the camera was on video mode, which i didn't notice immediately (I had a couple drinks already), and so when I realised and told them, it got a few laughs out of them, which helped to break the ice so to speak (instead of just taking a photo and leaving). After I had taken the photo, the girl who's phone it was came over to me to thank me and this is where I thought I'd give some Seddit tips a go. 

I immediately went in with some **kino**, and I did the same for her, all while doing my best to maintain **eye contact**. She then wanted to take a picture with me and her friend, she introduced me to two of her friends, and again I thought this was a great opportunity for more kino, arm on her lower back again. 

At this point, anyways HB8 asked where I was going with my friends next (yes, I was aware my friends were still waiting for me, but I had glanced at them a couple times when talking to HB8 and they were laughing mostly, but gave me a ""no worries, thumbs up, go for it gesture). I told her we were going to this club (lets call it Club A), and asked if I wanted to come with her. I thought this would be a good opportunity for some more simple advice from Seddit, ""Why don't you come with us to Club A?"" (the **pull**). She liked the idea, I just wanted to stick with my friends for a bit longer. Also her friends weren't too keen on going to Club A

The whole way to Club A I made sure to use lots of **kino**, standing near her and just chatting. Also periodically having a conversation with my friends instead of her for a bit, so as to slightly ignore her ( **push**). When we got to Club A, we all got a drink and sat near the bar, talking to each other and moving to the music a bit. Eventually my friends decided to play pool, as I was mostly talking to HB8. 

I was both surprised and pleased at this point that I had managed to convince this girl I only met like 15 mins ago to come with me and my friends to a club, and they were totally fine with it, plus they were playing pool, so they were occupied. I then asked if HB8 wanted to go to Club B now, and she seemed excited that I initiated the question to leave with her (**pull**). She was the one leading the way there and again lots of **kino** on the way there, arm on lower back, or holding hands while she led the way. 

Upon arriving at Club B, and while on the escalator I made sure to get very close to her, face to face, while holding my arms around her, lots of **smiling and eye contact**. Just when were about to get off I went in for a **kiss**, and she made no resistance. I thought this was a good idea as I had read on seddit that you want to **initiate the sexual contact early on in the night, not at the end**, I managed to get a few kisses in as we were dancing as well. After she needed to go to the bathroom and so we left the dance floor. When she came out I asked if she wanted to sit down somewhere and she agreed. We started making out

She finally found her friend, (seddit tip: **engage with her friends**), and he was surprisingly extremely nice to me, he bought me two drinks throughout the course of the night there without me even asking for one from him. So her friend came and went, and we continued making out, and eventually the question ""so where to you live, and do you live at home"" came up. Unfortunately I'm home from college for the summer and so I am living at home, I said lets give it a go

We went at it on and off for and hour and a half, before there was any danger of anyone waking up. Called her a cab and said said goodbye, sealing it with a kiss. 

**TL;DR** Random HB8 asks me to take a photo of her and her friends, push/pull, eye contact, engage her friends, sexual contact early on), and F-closed her at my place with my parents and brothers fast asleep in their rooms down the hall. ",Field Report,,,
1364952049.0,1bk2gv,3 Steps to Creating Much Better Conversations,wowboston,448,106,55,"TLDR (If you are pretty social already

I found seddit about 3 months ago, but not focusing specifically on women.  When I found seddit, it hugely improved my ability to close, but I already had a good social/conversational base down.  Here is how I did it, over a bunch of years.

STEP 1):  If you feel like you aren't able to get a conversation started and you need to go to a really basic step, these are good enough openers to get you started.  Rarely will a women or random other person not answer one of these questions.  For noncollege (Where are you from?, Do they have any special drinks here? Do you know if it is supposed to rain tomorrow? etc. etc. write down 3-5 random questions,)

Go out, but your primary goal should be 3 questions)  Once you get them in, ask more questions.  This style of conversation feels like an interview, and it won't get you laid nor will it get you to be the most social person, but it will get you started.  Once you can ask people those questions comfortably, move to step 2.

STEP 2):  After they answer the question, ask another question.  This is radically more social than step 1.  Most people can barely do this well.  Once you get good at this, move to step 3.  

STEP 3):  Step 3 is where you become much

Once you have 1 &amp; 2


A) Trips you have been on
B) How you moved to your current city
C) Anything that happened that is unusually you can think of
D) Parties you went to etc.
All the stories should ideally have a hint of DHV

After you have your topics
Beginning
Middle 
End

Once you have a few stories lined up, but instead of just saying where you live, you would tell a story about when you moved in there and how your friends all helped you etc.  (stories should be short! max 5-7 sentences, long stories are terrible until you get really good at telling them.)  After you tell the story, you can go back to a question if they don't tell their own story.  

If you do those 3 steps

***I read a book called Telling To Win

[ADDED]  In response to a few comments below:  Steps 1 and 2 are really for beginners or people who are struggling with making a lot of impact in their conversations.  Step 3, it starts in your head until you are more natural.  Once you are natural at this you no longer think in steps, you just tell stories, ask questions... then your realize you are having great conversations that lots of people want to be involved in.

Can you compare women in 2012 to 10 yrs? 20 yrs ago? How have they changed since y'all were younger guys? Let us young players know how the game has changed.

Here was his response:

Oh yeah. Well for starters, she would answer the phone when you called, or return your call every time. You simply have to chase a lot harder now. It takes more work now than it did when I was in my early to mid 20s.

The era before texting, not to be digital attention whores. 

Back in the 90's me and a buddy would hit a different small town about every weekend and pull with little effort. We'd just sit and bullshit and the broads would gravitate in our direction. We were often asked if we were married because we paid no attention to them. I rarely have this happen anymore. They are too busy texting and taking pics of each other.

As has been mentioned previous

They didn't get validated by useless chodes daily on FB or POF/OKC. They got validated by getting fucked well by me.

Also, if you don't call her back it's like farting with her head under the covers.

1352307998.0,12szqw,Somewhat of a revelation tonight..,TonelessMoon,442,107,81,"Now tonight wasn't anything special

Anyways, every *good looking girl* that would walk past, he'd simply touch them on the shoulder and say 'You look fabulous tonight!' (if they turned away, 'I just had to tell you, you gorgeous girl!!!', if they continued... such a lad, had a quick chat and then directed them toward us)


The point is, listening and replicating what he did. He truly inspired me to just grab a passing girl and chat. First Emily, then Courtney, Danielle, Rebekah.... Wow... This was a huge eye opener. 


Lessons learnt;

1. AA is what you make it. Dive in
2. Things go to shit

3. When rejected (never if, everything else a bonus.

4. Be happy and show interest! This was huge. Emily kept coming back to the bar and hovering like a fly around me, she'd get to the bar right next to me, and just pull out her phone for 10s, and walk off and not order a drink. I know she was waiting for me to make a move / re-initiate a convo, but i didn't. Silly confidence issue I'm working on, but the interest was there.

5. I had the realisation, want to have a chat and a little flirt and just meet cool people). WE ARE ON THE SAME LEVEL. No one is special in a scene like that. Fuck it, have fun.


Now, but, thanks to Carlos, he showed me how easy it is to smash AA w/ a sledgehammer of playful banter. Literally, just say hi and have fun :)

Can't wait for tomorrow to do it all again!!!

I've been lurking here for too long and while I've been making subtle (and some accidental) approaches while drunk

Earlier today I was at the gym with two other friends. Super confident with my newly cut hair. Saw this solid HB8 brunette working there

**Fuck it. I'm doing it. Look in to her eyes. Smile. You're the king of the world. It's go time.**

Me: Hi. I would regret not talking to you. I think you are cute.

She smiled or said thanks or something

Shook hands
I asked her if she worked there often
She told me she actually was the manager of that gym
I should have negged her in a funny way ""wow

She said she was 22. I asked her how old she thought I was. Good work me! It made the conversation sooo much more smooth and funny. She guessed 25 and I played a little with her ""a liiiittle lower"". When I told her my age she said: ""Wow you are not old!"".

Sorry if this is incoherent, was super efficient, she thought it was funny and replied with ""I actually do have a boyfriend.."". (Might have been a shit test). My response was ""you know pretty girls are allowed to have two ;)"". ""Ohhh haha, in what bible does it say that?"". ""Haven't you read the universal book of rules?"". 

The interaction ends with her asking what my name was again and says ""Let's do it.. maybe. I will look you up in the system ;)"". I noticed she was interested. I laughed and called her out on checking my personal info. I went to take a swim with my friends but I noticed she messaged me on facebook (nooo! # &lt; fb) almost instantly. Haven't read it. Quite interesting as she only had my first name

Reading through my own post gives me the impression that I was quite needy

**Things I'm proud of:**

* Doing an approach.

* Doing a cold approach. Damn even if I was going to be rejected

* I looked deeply into her brown eyes during the whole conversation (It gave me so much power in the interaction. Try it. It's crazy.)

* I was talking slowly and confident

**Things I should have done better:**

* When I was walking away I should have taken her number!

TLDR: Overcame AA for the first time in my life during day game. She had a bf but she looked me up and contacted me on facebook.

----

**Update:**

I'm beginning to thinik I'm being played with. Not sure I'm just being paranoid.

She read my message the same night as I sent it
The thing is that I was contacted by a girl who had previously seduced me (like 6 months ago)
The creepy thing is that she is the only mutual friend with HB8 on facebook and she's being super on. On the other side

Oh and by the way, perhaps she'll work there and I'll try to seduce her.

My question to you is: If she's not there

**Update 2**

Was there, she wanted to hold on to it because of embaressness, much like a child is never wrong (""I totally wanted this read this magazine. I totally didn't want the toy that came with it!"") .

OK

Obviously everyone's beliefs and situations are different, friend-with-benefits, or anything in between.

I'm going to describe three different men to you. Think long and hard about your experience so far and be honest with yourself. Are you falling into any of these traps? If so

**Man #1: The Dancing Monkey**

The Dancing Monkey works hard to entertain his date. His frame of mind is, is rebuffed. He has had the *""Let's just be friends""* conversation more times than he's proud of.

**Man #2: The Non-sexual Nice Guy**

The Non-sexual Nice Guy is, by being nice and cordial, he will win the girl. He holds doors, doesn't complain much, and gets lots of compliments from women. He shirks away from public displays of affection. He's deathly afraid to offend others. He ""likes"" girls' Facebook comments often. He too, goes for the kiss at the end of the night, and more often than not

**Man #3: [The Modern Alpha Male](http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/fobhj/lesson_1_primer_on_being_a_modern_alpha_male/)**

He's not ""alpha"" in the fist-pumping, Women find him irresistible. He has no problem attracting and keeping women. His life is abundant. He has sex often.

In more cases than not

Learning and practicing physical escalation with women is one of the final keys in your development. **Master this one skill and you will be that much closer to becoming the man you want to be.**

---

**Physical Escalation**

This scenario happens all the time. A man is on a date with a woman. The man fails to touch the girl and only goes in for the kiss at the end of the night. He goes home alone. His internal dialogue says

Meanwhile, wondering if the guy likes her. Her internal dialogue says, *""I thought that was a date. I guess he just wants to be friends?""*

ALWAYS BE ESCALATING! That entire miscommunication could have been avoided if the man had just escalated physically. Don't fall into that trap!

All the greatest seducers in history could not keep their hands off of women. They aggressively escalated physically with every woman they were flirting with. They began touching them immediately, she KNOWS that you desire her. That's hot. It arouses her physically and psychologically.

---

**Leading with your body**

The concept of ""waiting for signs"" or ""Indicators of Interest"" was commonplace in older pickup theory. It is 100% garbage and needs to be erased from the face of the planet.

Never, wait for a SIGN before you escalate! You will miss out on the vast majority of chances if you sit around waiting for SIGNS. **Men are notoriously bad at reading women's minds and body language. Don't think that you're any different.** From now on you must ASSUME that she is attracted to you and wants to be ravished. It's a difference in mindset that makes champs champs and chumps chumps.

As stated back in the section on Flirting in [Part 5](http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/1di9xu/above_the_game_part_5_flirting_touch_conversation/), to lead the interaction. Be playful. Spin her around. Pick her up. Push her away as a tease and then pull her back in. 

Decide that you're going to sit in a position where you can rub her leg and back. Physically pick her up and sit her on your lap. **Don't ask for permission. Be dominant. Force her to rebuff your advances.**

If you adopt this mindset, and you'll know. Then it's just a matter of manning up and going for the kiss. Even if she rejects your initial advance, you'll have raised your chance of success in the future. 

---
**IMPORTANT NOTE ON RESISTANCE:**

If at any point a girl wants you to stop,"" or shoves you away, you know she is not interested. It happens. Stop escalating immediately and say this line:

**""No problem. I don't want you to do anything you aren't comfortable with.""**

Memorize that line. It is your go-to when faced with resistance. Say it genuinely

All that matters is that you continue to try to escalate physically until she makes it genuinely clear that it's not happening. She wants to be desired, we can't... my parents are in the next room... OMG FUCK ME FUCK ME HARD""* from the *""SERIOUSLY GET THE FUCK OFF OF ME, YOU CREEP""* variety of resistance.

Of course if you're really unclear

---

Stop being afraid to offend. You will go through a period of adjustment as you gain experience

Now that you have made your intentions abundantly clear to the girl with your body language, you will find yourself in situations where women are very receptive to your advances. Now is the time to ramp up the physical escalation. Hopefully you've [managed your logistics](http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/1dtb8m/above_the_game_part_6_logistics_getting_the/) and can get her into a private, intimate setting for what follows...

---

**Kissing**

Be bold when you go for kisses. Try early and often. It's important. Equally important is being a good kisser. Women are substantially more likely to date &amp; sleep with men who are *GOOD KISSERS.*

One common mistake men make is waiting until the end of the night to go for the kiss. Doing this raises the awkward quotient substantially until it's a build up to *""this big thing.""* That can scare women off. It's much more effective to sneak a kiss in during the date

Likewise, as you're opening your front door, etc.) This sets a sexual tone and diffuses awkwardness that can lead to additional resistance.

The secret to good kissing is using your body and not just your tongue. Don't slobber all over her like a dog, grab her by the hips and pull her into you. Press your groin right into hers. Make her feel your erection. Trust me, this turns women on incredibly.

Softly bite her lower lip. Go Dracula on her neck and kiss it all over. Kiss her collarbone. Softly kiss her ears.

---

**Fondling**

Let your hands roam free. Squeeze her ass. Rub the side of her breasts. Rub your hands up and down her legs. Make her push your hand away as you get closer to her vagina. **Fucking ravish her.**

Grab her hair on the back of her head

After a few minutes

Unbutton her pants

Gently graze her clitoris. (Note: Spend some time researching the female anatomy if you lack sexual experience. You need to know where everything is located

Insert a finger into her vagina. Then two. (Two is the magic number

Spend some time fingering her. Don't be shy. A very large percentage of women can achieve orgasm from this sort of stimulation. Your chances of repeat performances goes up tremendously with each orgasm.

---

**Sounds**

Grunt

---

**Sex**

Pull out your cock and put her hand on it. *Remember, and put it right on your dick.*

Tell her to suck your dick. Be dominant. Tell her how *fucking hot* she looks with your dick in her mouth.

Reciprocate and go down on her. Softly finger her while you flick her clitoris with your tongue. Enjoy all of her body movements. Really soak in the passion; this is as good as it gets!

**Be passionate! Passionate sex equals good sex! This is NOT the time to be shy.**

Slip on a condom and fuck her like a champion. Pull her hair, let her ride you. Experiment with each other! Ask her what her favorite positions are. Touch her everywhere, including her arms, legs, throat, face, and breasts. Make her cum with the force of the hammer of Thor. **Rock her fucking world.**

There is no substitute for sexual experience. Anyone can become a sexual master with a little bit of research

---

**Action Items**

1) Go to your local bookstore and walk through the ""Sex and Relationships"" section. Pick up a handful of books that look interesting to you. Spend an afternoon thumbing through sex books to get an idea of what good sex is all about. Read 50 Shades of Grey or some other chick-porn.

If you're getting her number we're going to assume you've already approached and struck up conversation.

My favorites:

1. After you've been talking a little bit, a napkin, whatever. Draw the following:

_ _ _ - _ _ _ - _ _ _ _

At the top write ""You fill in the rest"". Guys, use this fucking technique! It is my go to now and I haven't had a girl say no yet.

2. Just flat out approach her and ask her for it. (ex: ""You're really gorgeous and I was just wondering if I could get your number?"") Maintaining eye contact is key! If she looks away, crazy, doesn't work, or whatever. We'll they're wrong. I have used it and gotten numbers. No plan is 100% guaranteed, but you'd be surprised at how high of a success rate this has. 

3. Approach a girl, you're back where you were before you handed her the number and it only took you 5 seconds to write it down in the first place.

4. After about 5 to 10 minutes of conversation, read her body language, are you making her laugh?, etc. 

My favorite one is the first one. It has seriously been my go to for every number I get now. Girls find it comical and it's unique.

1337010574.0,tml0a,A word of caution,outkillingpepperonii,409,74,162,"**EDIT: A lot of good advice was given. This is why I come to seddit

Number one rule: I love you all. You are the reason I am even in this situation so props to you guys. I want to share an experience that I had and I want you guys to take a lesson from it. This is more for the loner's who have never had a girlfriend or are out of touch with their feelings like I am. 

It started as me wanting to get laid. I came on seddit. I approached girls. I met this one girl at a bus stop last year, and had sex. As I got to know her more, I started to like her. I was so obsessed with seddit that I thought relationships were for morons, and I ignored my typical oneitis feelings. 

We kept meeting up and having sex, I denied it even though now I realize its true. I was also denying strong feelings of wanting to be with her so I can develop my player skills.

Last weekend, the child version of myself is cringing at what I have become. This girl is everything I've been wanting my whole life. Every time I saw a couple holding hands, I got mad out of jealousy. And here it was staring me in the face, and I denied it. 

I confronted her Saturday night when we were going to a formal for her sorority, and I will wait however long it takes for her to get intimate with me again. 

I don't blame anyone for my actions except for myself. I simply offer a word of caution. Many players here and in mainstream PUA teach you how to sleep with tons of women, while still being controlled by them. Don't let this happen. Now I have to try and salvage something that was there from the start, when I never had to. Again, I blame nobody for my actions except myself, as I should have realized this was happening. It seems I have problems with intimacy and realizing what the fuck I'm feeling. I went from 100% emotion to 100% logic, and it worked out HORRIBLY. It seems the correct relationship is emotion controlled by logic. You need both.",,,,
1370982783.0,1g5am0,My advice for online dating profiles,JihadDerp,415,82,55,"I get a decent response rate on OKCupid and Pof. I've been on more dates than I can count, and subsequently have been getting PMs asking for advice

**edit:** you can get plenty of advice and profile critiques over at /r/okcupid and /r/pof

My advice for all profiles in general consists of these main points:

The persona that does best (for me) is whimsical and funny with just a sprinkle of seriousness. So try to write with a whimsical and funny voice. It actually might help to get drunk and watch some stand-up comedy before you write your profile to put yourself in a whimsical/funny mood. I'm being completely serious about that. Drinking will make you whimsical

But

**1) Be as funny as you can, you'll see some variation of the phrase, ""I love to laugh"" or ""I love a good sense of humor"" about 700 times. Humor is like a social aphrodisiac. Be funny as much as you possibly can, but MOST IMPORTANTLY, try not to sound like you're trying too hard. Make an active effort to not try too hard. It's hard to put into words guys who are obviously trying too hard; it's one of those things you can only call out when you see it. But I'm sure you've seen it before. Don't sound like you're trying too hard.

**2) Never describe your qualities. Rather, ""I'm funny"" or ""I'm adventurous"" or anything that literally any other guy could say. Those are descriptions, and they are meaningless, because anybody can say them. The alternative is to demonstrate/illustrate/show your sense of humor or your sense of adventure with a funny joke, witty line, or story about something adventurous you did. Don't just say you're funny; BE funny. So instead of, ""I have a good sense of humor, ""If George Carlin and Mitch Hedberg had a love child,"" you should say something like

I'm going to give more examples of demonstrations versus descriptions, ""I'm really good at getting out of awkward conversations by saying things like 'OH GOD. HELP ME. THIS IS SO AWFUL. I WISH I WAS DEAD.'"" I thought that was perfect. It SHOWED she's ""mirthful and blustery,"" it SHOWED she's funny, and it SHOWED she can't stand boring conversation--all in one relatively short sentence without describing herself. She didn't say, ""I'm mirthful, blustery, funny, don't describe. Don't write a resume about yourself

Chuck Palahniuk has a good essay on how to write with engrossing detail. It's for fiction writers

I can't stress the importance of that enough. Paint a picture of yourself. Don't describe yourself. This alone will set you apart from 99% of the guys out there. Setting yourself apart is one of the most important factors of success

**3) Be concise.** This goes for your profile and your messages, your goal should be to be short, sweet, and to the point--that goes for both profiles and messages. You want to make maximum impact with minimal words. DO NOT get wordy (unless you're awesome and know for a fact you are enthralling with your words). If you've written something, chances are you need to cut it in half, and even then it'll be too long. That's actually an exercise writers do to improve--they write, then they cut it in half. Concision is key.

**4) Don't sound like you're trying too hard or desperate.** This one is hard for me to elaborate on. You kind of just know it when you see it. Phrases like ""I'm looking for true love"" or anything remotely similar are phrases that send up ""I'm trying too hard"" flags. You want to sound casual, that's a nice bonus. And remember, you're going for whimsical and funny, so trying-too-hard phrases like ""I want to meet the girl of my dreams"" (unless it's in the context of a hilarious joke) do not fit that whimsical/funny persona.

**5) Be interesting/original.** Like I said, ""Has she probably heard this line or a similar one before?"" If yes, delete, rewrite, and repeat. If you're not sure what's too unoriginal, browse profiles for about 40 guys, and you'll start to see the same thing get written ooooover and oooover again. If you browse enough women's profiles, descriptions

**6) Demonstrate that you're decisive, these are the hot-button qualities girls find attractive in guys. ""Decisive"" means you shouldn't be throwing out contradictory phrases, regardless of how true they are, that try to cover a bunch of qualities. For example, a lot of people say something along the lines of, ""I like to go out and have fun, but I also like to stay in and chill."" There are so many problems with that line. 1) It's more boring than watching paint dry. 2) It's unoriginal; everybody says it. 3) It sounds like you're writing for a horoscope. 4) It doesn't actively demonstrate decisiveness, ""Life is short, GIRLS LOVE FUNNY.) Oh and most importantly...

...

...

...

**7) Leave hooks.** Like the cliffhangers at the end of episodes of LOST (or whatever suspenseful show/movie you're familiar with), or be too much of an open book. I mean, you can be specific and say things about yourself, but every once in a while, you want to be somewhat mysterious to grab their interest. So for example, instead of saying something like, ""I had a great time travelling to Mexico because we met a guy named Pedro who gave us a tour of his hometown, ""If you ever go to Mexico

Remember, yet nothing at all (because you leave out personal details). 

**8) Pictures:** don't take a cell phone picture of yourself in the bathroom mirror. I didn't know guys actually do this. It's fucking ridiculous. Girls agree. 

Only post good pictures of yourself. What's ""good?"" Preferably pictures that have a positive vibe, or where you're in a social setting (around other people and it looks like everybody is having a good time). Girls like guys who have ""social proof."" You demonstrate social proof by showing people having a good time around you. Nobody likes a boring loner. It's okay to post a picture of yourself alone, but only if it makes sense -- like a head shot that you didn't take yourself -- one that was cropped from another picture, or maybe taken professionally. Never post a picture you took of yourself unless it's really really funny or demonstrates a good part of your personality. Girls hate it when guys post self-taken pictures. Seriously. I know I said ""most importantly"" a few times now, but this next one is really probably the most important...

Look at all these hooks! Hooks everywhere! But seriously...

**9) Use proper grammar and spelling.** A lot of women use grammar/spelling to instantly screen out people. They'll immediately click away from profiles that don't use proper spelling and grammar. Girls want guys who are educated and well read. Whether or not your shitty grammar/spelling is symptomatic of idiocy is irrelevant. Enough girls use it as a screen to make it important. It's a simple fix. Don't ruin your odds by being lazy and/or actually stupid. Edit your shit to sound halfway smart.

1339079995.0,upteq,I think it's worth clarifying what exactly it is that we do here on Seddit.,world_B_free,432,97,132,"Yeah

Look, or at least not what ""pickup"" is intended to be used for. Learning pickup nowadays, as long as the learner is a decent human being, is nothing more then gaining understanding of what attracts a woman to a man and then making the necessary improvements in one's life to take on those qualities. 

Is there a particular ethos of the seduction communtiy? Of course there's a fucking ethos: Always seek to improve yourself in all aspects of life and build yourself into a valuable person because this is what allows a man to have the best of both worlds: awesome sex with A LOT of beautiful girls

If you feel that seduction/pickup has in some way perplexed you or negatively effected you, which is unfortunately a large portion of the seduction community, can get loads of pussy thinking they need to somehow manipulate girls to fuck them, but I can assure you that this type of approach to pickup will only create problems in your life and will never land you the woman that's so fucking awesome that she's worth spending the rest of your life with.

We're not here to ""trick"" girls into sleeping with us. We're here to improve not only our own lives but the lives of the girls whose pants we're ripping off. Do you guys have any idea how frustrated women are about men these days? Do you have any idea how fucking siked women are to meet a fun

Men are stupid

TL;DR There are a lot of people that have completely misinterpreted pickup altogether and are thus doomed to a second-rate sex life.

**My Story:**

My childhood was probably very similar to yours. I grew up in a small suburb. I sucked at sports and spent a lot of time playing video games and messing around on my computer. I was introduced to my first girlfriend at 15. Great

We went to college together (bad idea) and

After two sexless years of college

I had no idea what I was doing there either. After over six months in the country

Fast forward a couple months... I got out of my latest rut and decided that enough was enough. I began going out, American, partially fluent in the local language, and drunk. Lo and behold, I started getting laid with ugly chicks out of sheer luck.

Then I returned to the US. I spent my last two years of college sexless once again. I wasn't going out

I finally met a girl from the internet and she let me put my dick in her. Since I still had no idea what I was doing

Around this time I picked up a copy of *The Game* at a friend's house. I found it interesting. A few weeks later

At that that time I was living in New York City. I fumbled my way through nightclubs, and parties. I started having sex with a lot of women - and, finally, some of them were even hot!

In 2010 I took a new job and relocated back to Tokyo. I had lost touch with almost my entire college network. I needed to build a social circle from scratch. Since I had lots of time on my hands

I began consuming material, reading and most importantly - GOING OUT. I met up with a couple of the local Tokyo-based sedditors. I posted field reports and became an active contributor. Within a few months I was added as a moderator and the rest is history.

Since discovering seddit

Throughout all of this, based on real in-field experience and coaching I've done, distilling the best theory, advice, and methods into one condensed methodology - complete with action items for people to start implementing immediately. These notes form the basis of *Above The Game.*

1375866925.0,1jvg1p,[FR] K-close girl from street with offhand comment,olepeterbarbrady,415,84,53,"Hey Seddit

I haven't done an FR in awhile

At the first place we went to, I'm pretty sure I just asked them some questions and got the jitters out, then they left and we moved on. We ended up playing some beer pong and having a good time for an hour or two, then we decided to move to a different bar. Before we go inside, these two girls walk by slowly while looking at the entrance to the bar, I make a comment about how they obviously want to go inside, and they should come hang out with us. I don't intend for this to go anywhere, but maybe she'll come back.

We go inside and look at the drink menu. Within a few minutes the girl who walked by with her friend walks up behind me at the bar

We talk for a bit, not forced, its important to touch people in a way that doesn't violate them, not just women, its starts with just touching elbows and shoulders when making a comment to putting your arm around her shoulder or touching her knee, it should be natural to you, and if it isn't practice it

The conversation goes great

At this point

When we got back to my place, rather than just going for it, and it was an interesting approach, because she was expecting it and seemed more into it than caught off guard. I just gave her a quick kiss on the lips, hung for a second, and pulled back.

Then, I took off her glasses and started kissing her, this time a bit more passionately, but still not too eager.

Then, hooking up would be fun, but I've never formed good relationships by sleeping with someone the night I met them. I walked her to a cab, got her number and said I'd take her out this weekend.

1365092639.0,1bo2wp,Red Pill/Seduction knowledge implemented,IamTheCarousel,425,99,94,"Disclaimer:  I'm in Asia.  Your results may very in the U.S.

Tonight I played my cards well and implemented some red pill knowledge to excellent effects.  Full on Alpha abundance mode. Here's how it went:  

I had a casual date/hang out with a girl I've seen a few times now. She seems to be into me but things aren't progressing much as she sort of has an ""It's complicated"" long distance relationship going and at this point we are just ""friends"" despite clear indicators of interest (touching

Well I was hanging out with friend-girl about an hour multitasking watching a movie while doing a little email maintenance periodically. (I know

Anyways another girl had messaged me from a dating website about meeting later in the night.  I wasn't too thrilled with where the night was going so I agreed to meet her.   She then mentions she is with her friend

My manhamster gets a spinning and I get an idea.   Since new girl isn't down for a meet one on one and is hanging with her friend

So rather than tell friend-girl I'm leaving and she needs to go

Anyways as I stroll upstairs to meet new girl and her friend at a restaurant our eyes meet as I ascend the stairs and I get a smile so apparently I'm ok for her.  Then she sees the ""friend"" I brought.  The expression on the two girls faces were priceless.   ""WTF?? Did this guy bring a girl on a date??""

I stroll up relaxed and confident with friend-girl.  ""Hey what's up nice to meet you?"".   They are all at once smiling

Girls: ""Ummm..is that your girlfriend?""   

Me: ""No we are just friends"".  

Girls: ""Umm you can't do that!!""

Me: ""Sure I can.  You did.  You brought a friend so I figured I can as well"".

Girls:  ""But ..but...that's rude.  You're like on a date.  What is she supposed to do?"" 

Me:  ""We can all chat.  Besides


At this point the girls' hamsters seemed to simultaneously have a stroke and my reasoning prevailed.  These girls could barely contain themselves.   Huge grins on their face

Anyways played it cool and calm as shit and engaged the two girls in conversation also bouncing back to the girl I brought.   

Let me tell you these girls were intrigued and turned on. The mood was exciting and filled with a sexual vibe.  And this bumped up my market value to friend-girl I brought also.  After a bit I could feel some jealousy that I wasn't paying enough attention to her.  After I did she started to be affectionate touching my arm at times.

Anyways, and preselection.  There was a definite chance that I could mess it up with the friend I brought, mess up a date and embarrass myself in front of my dates friend.  But I. Don't. Care.  That shows abundance.  

I was calm and relaxed and brought just enough energy to keep the conversation flowing smoothly.   After an hour I told the girls thanks for meeting me

After that I went home.  My female friend is blowing up my phone talking about the night asking if I would date her if she breaks up with her bf.   Asking what I think about the girl I met etc.

Also the girl I met on the date is blowing up my phone now asking about me and what I thought about her friend and setting up another meet.

I didn't look especially great tonight.  I wasn't any more entertaining then normal.  I just simply played my cards well in a way that displayed true abundance mentality and it was effective like clockwork.

Seddit should be about all self-improvement and seduction. Once you have the balls to talk to somebody you need to have 
something to say. If you want a relationship with a smart girl and not just a one night stand then you need to be interesting. 
Confidence is only half the equation towards demonstrating high value. [This guy is probably confident](http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/imagebuzz/web03/2011/7/11/21/peace-be-with-you-brah-18107-1310432507-16.jpg)

What can you do? Learn some patterns for telling anecdotes, anyone else want to join?

### Simple tricks for interesting conversation with somebody you already know

1. Ask relevant blue sky
2. Give them the tl;dr rather than the story
 e.g. ""I humiliated myself yesterday"". ""how?"". ""I fell off my bike while eating an ice cream"". 
""Hah!? why/how/where?"". Then go into detail
""life-lesson"" at the end.

### Intelligent conversation topics for the lazy:

When bored (or feel like lightly preparing for a dinner party type thing) I get some good topics [from here](http://www.aldaily.com/)
Also read slate.com, and the top-posts-of-the-week in /r/truereddit. Sunday newspapers are great too.

### How to tell if your field report is any good: a tongue-in-cheek checklist (tongue-in-cheeklist)

☐ Some people don't believe you    
☐ Some people say it was ""easy
☐ Some people accuse you of rape    
☐ You are told you wrote too much    
☐ You are asked to write more and clarify things    
☐ You get hate-PMs    
☐ You get dismissed as 'you must be attractive'    
☐ But mostly people seem to like it and leave nice comments

### Summer clothes

Summer is here. Some good guides have popped up on dressing well cheaply in the UK and US on /r/malefashionadvice. Don't miss out. I just bought some [white buck shoes](http://www.jcrew.com/mens_category/shoes/oxfords/PRDOVR~64609/64609.jsp).

### Your Myers-Briggs personality type and how you can use it.

Can be fun to talk about. Also look up the ""big five"" personality types.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myers-Briggs_Type_Indicator

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_five_personality_traits

Personality type has become a favourite conversation topic of mine
horoscopes and answering quizzes. Psychology is fun. 

Also it could be a great goal when meeting somebody: find out their type ASAP.

My type is ESTP

You can learn your main sticking points and how to improve a little easier if you look at the weaknesses of your type.

### A Piracetam call to arms

4 months ago I made a post (http://redd.it/m1ga0) about a nootropic (""smart drug"")
it on days when I expect to be a bit antisocial because of work piling up.

I've had several PMs and messages from some people who have had pronounced and positive effects. One such review was:

    I'd simply like to let you know that I'm grateful for your post about piracetam about 4 months ago. 
    Based upon your review of it I decided to try it myself. The supplement/drug
    affects me in a very similar way. I've noticed a great increase in confidence
    posture and most of all
    I don't plan on taking it every day
    be in tight social situations. Thanks for posting your experiences with the 
    substance; it sure helped me.
    Thanks.
    
**Did anybody else try piracetam? What were your thoughts?** 

I have had issues with mixing it with too much caffeine (2 cups of coffee or more) - sometimes I have had anxiety (very unpleasant) and other times I become horny and very confident and start hitting on people when I probably shouldn't...

1337199031.0,tqgvn,"Why ""Be Yourself"" is the Best Advice",HelloHiHello,419,98,116,"This is a response to TrippAdvice1's ""Why 'Be Yourself' is the Worst Advice."" (http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/tgw28/why_be_yourself_is_the_worst_advice/)

A response but not a rebuttal. I'd like to talk about the frame set by this point: ""the you isn’t good enough right now.""

1.

The YOU is good enough. It's more than good enough. In fact

Let me explain.

The ""you"" that's not good enough is not YOU. It's a construction of your ego. Through how you were raised

A simple example.

You see a group of girls. Instinctively

But you don't approach.

*""They'll think I'm creepy.""* 

“You” (the ego) tell yourself (YOU) that.

It happens ALL the time. So often, it gets more difficult to sense what we want to do.

The true desires are still there – they’re just hidden by the ego.

60 Years of Challenge has a theory:

Whether you have a good or bad night is determined by **whether you do what you want to do or not.**

You're standing in line at a club. The people next to you are talking and YOU want to join in the conversation. If you join in

If you join in, they’d say something”).

But what if you say something and they don’t respond? 

It’s like getting rejected by a girl. Yes

Experienced PUA’s know a good night doesn’t start until the first rejection.

Now you go up to the bouncer. YOU want to say something to him. If you do

60 says good and bad nights are NOT determined by approaches. They're determined before you walk in the door. They're determined by how often you said “yes” to YOURSELF

**A good night is when you “were yourself.”**

Important: when most people hear “just be yourself

It is possible to not be yourself and think you are. 

When you do what you want (talk to people in line, you build confidence. When you don’t because of the ego, you create anxiety.

You don’t talk to people in line. You may think

You don’t talk to the bouncer. No big deal; except it is. You enter the club **already in an anxious state.** 

Conversely

This is “state control.” This is “frame management.” The secret is BE YOURSELF –knowing what that means is the hard part.

2.

Why do I say you are good enough? Because you are. 

When you see a girl

YOU are capable of doing everything you’ve ever wanted to do. So why don’t you? The ego.

Therefore

Sure

Why don’t you listen?

Why are you spending the majority of your life not being yourself? Why does 99% of the world spend their entire lives living in the ego construction? Why are we so afraid of being ourselves?

3.

I’ve struggled with social anxiety. I’ve always been in touch with what I’ve wanted to do – I just haven’t done it. I wanted to call that girl up

Saying no brought me anxiety. 

Funnily enough

You cannot win when you are your ego construction

How? Be yourself. Honesty.

The first girl I ever met through cold approach taught me this lesson.

When I hung out with her, I wanted to escalate. I didn’t. When we got back to her place, I wanted to fool around. I didn’t bring it up.

The end result? Suffocating anxiety. 

The second I left

I’d never felt that kind of anxiety before (blame it on inexperience), “why do you come over here?”

I decided to be honest. I decided to tell her I felt fucking anxious whenever I was over. I always wanted to do things but never did.

And just like that

Anxiety exists in your head. As soon as you bring anxiety into the real world

Because when you’re honest

You are good enough. 

You have everything you need. It’s time to start **doing what you want to do.** Say YES to yourself, you are rewarded with anxiety.

Edit: A couple sedditors have given a couple other good reasons why this is good. Six,  a sports team etc. it could potentially lead to a conversation if she happens to have the same interests, you never know. Seven, and this one is crucial, you always text immediately right in front of her and say ""I'll text you something so you can have my number"" this way you can verify the validity of the phone number and at the same time send a short witty response with your name. Always try and relate that witty text to something related to what you spoke about.

Just approach.

You know how I find out if a woman is interested in me?

I start talking to her.

If she starts smiling, I begin touching her.

If she touches back, and lets me escalate, I keep going. 

It's like I'm playing limbo. Every time I pass one mark, fellas.

But that all starts small with an approach, ABCs, 123s, or any other acronym that you're trying to pull out of your ass because you don't have the balls to approach.

**Never look for a green light to start a conversation - you won't find one.** And even if you do

This isn't ""National Geographic Presents: The Woman."" You're not here to analyze what it means when a girl is ""tapping her toes"" or ""pouting her lips.""

Are you interacting with her? No? Then your observations don't mean sh*t.

Honestly, and talk to her. That's the only way you can get anything started, with anyone.**

Yeah, too. Think I came out this way?

*/r/Seduction is by far the best seduction community I've found online. Still, here's why.*

2.

What is attraction?

Attraction is a wavelength. A vibe. Attraction happens before thought. You see a girl, “she is attractive.” In that order.

This is what attraction is – that specific wavelength. It’s not the length of hair, attraction may be justified by the mind (“I like her because she wears skinny jeans, high heels and a leather jacket”).

We humans focus too much on our thoughts about something

We’re focused on our justifications for feeling attraction

This is why so many people think looks are everything in seduction. Because they don’t know how to manage their wavelength. They think,” then they say they aren’t attractive because they don’t have X.

How are wavelengths defined? Beliefs.

First

If I showed you a video of a political debate and said, you could because you were tuned into that signal. As a result, you got what was broadcasted – a lie.

So what are your beliefs on attraction? Do you believe you need to be a football star to be attractive? Then that is what your signal projects.

If your life is out of line with your definition of attractive, which is what attractive people are.”

Then girls will never view you as attractive

The problem is, “oh, girls just don’t find me attractive.” **But it’s not the girl!** How is a girl supposed to pick up on a signal you aren’t broadcasting?

Don’t blame your unattractiveness on external events

Back to the football example. You weren’t a football star but realized you needed to be one to get girls. So you work your ass off and eventually become a football star.

Now you’re aligned with your definition – you are

Suddenly girls are noticing you. You walked through the mall and all eyes were on you. A girl even walked up to you

You must’ve been right! People are only attracted to football stars!

No.

You have simply aligned your life with your definition of attraction. Now that you are someone you define as “attractive

Can you see how this confuses people? Since our beliefs are what define attraction

For the football player, I told you football players were attractive!” 

Well he is right

He then tells his friends

Here are a list of traits commonly defined as “attractive”:

• People who dress well are attractive.

• People who are thin are attractive.

• Men with big muscles get all the girls.

• Guys who can cook are sexy.

• Men who are interesting are a woman’s biggest turn on.

What is your definition of attractive? Do you fit in the mold of your definition? If not

And yes

How?

Simply change your definition of attractive to what you are currently.

“Does this mean I can be 500 pounds

Yes.

But only if you believe it. If you fully believe attraction is defined by being 500 pounds

But this will be very, **you would need to utterly destroy all your beliefs and rebuild them from the ground up.**

Therefore

How can you start? First look at your definition of yourself. Then look for evidence which supports a potential you being attractive. Then change your lifestyle to align yourself with your new definition of attractive.

I’m skinny. Gaining weight and muscle has always been difficult

I firmly believed attraction meant having muscles and definition. As a result

At this time

So I started working out. Slowly I gained definition. No

My definition of attraction: thin people who are well dressed

Through working out

I liked wearing t-shirts. I would go out in public and notice girls staring at me. I thought

But it wasn’t – it was about meeting my own definition of “attractive.”

Months later, so I was, even though what originally made me feel I was attractive was gone.

This is what you can do. Figure out who you are. If you are overweight and your definition of attractive is slender

1) Meet your current definition (aka

2) Change your current definition (look for evidence of overweight people who get a lot of girls

Do either of these and you will become attractive.

Welcome to life outside the matrix.

NOTES:

• *This also explains how people can “fall out” of being attractive. “I was attractive in high school

*It’s because the person’s definition of what is attractive changed.*

1331924309.0,qzr3n,My review of the Simple Pickup guys and Tyler Durden (RSD) after having seen both in field during the past week,TofuTofu,394,76,133,"Hey guys.

Last weekend I was in a bar for about 3-4 hours when all three of the Simple Pickup guys were sarging. And last night I got to observe Tyler Durden in field for about 90 minutes. I know a lot of you guys are curious/suspicious about how these guys are in field

First off

---

**Simple Pickup**

I was out with a couple of my /r/BayAreaSeddit brothers when we ran into all three Simple Pickup guys working game in a bar. These guys run direct game. They seem to be picky with their targets (looking for the hotter girls in the bar)

I did notice a couple of glaring flaws. One was that they would stay in set way too long just to get rejected when they went for make outs. It seemed like they were letting the night pass them by in exchange for a chance at physical escalation with a hottie later on. I don't know about you guys

My guess is it comes from inexperience. Knowing when to eject to maximize your lulz/possibilities is a skill that improves over time.

The other thing I noticed was a certain level of self-doubt. I went to say hi to one of them after he was rejected and out of set (I'm not a fan of cockblocking). He immediately began to utilize run-of-the-mill AMOG destroyers. My first thought was, don't be so quick to dismiss.""

It just didn't feel congruent with the qualities you'd expect from a true mPUA - self-validation and value giving. I expect the self-doubt stems from the cult they've created around themselves. They have a lot of expectations to live up to and they haven't quite arrived yet. I can sympathize with it. I'm sure Tyler Durden was the same way back during the writing of The Game. 

Needless to say

---

**Tyler Durden (RSD)**

heckz

So we're opening sets left and right

It turns out Jewiger k-closed and bounced a girl that blew Tyler Durden out earlier in the night

Anyway... I'm by the bar talking to a couple of the guys when I look and spot a wild Tyler Durden. I instantly stop what I'm doing and go into observation mode. Here is what I saw...

This might sound a little fanboyish

Just like me

His body language and the way he would physically open girls was flawless. Lots of ""the claw

He would do this move where he would just point at a girl with one arm and she would stop dead in her tracks. He'd then pull her in and escalate physically right away.

He would open girls this way even if they were in mixed sets

He would make gratuitous use of the ""Reality Destroyer"" openers that I used to use so much in Tokyo. Basically do things so alpha/random/awesome that girls' brains short circuit and enter pure attraction mode. It was a site to behold.

After that he would hold girls in very close and whisper into their ear. When he talks about generating attraction quickly

You could also tell the guy is totally congruent with being outcomes-independent. Blowouts didn't phase him at all. I loved how he would open the unattractive girls and give them a brief moment of bliss before spinning them off and letting them continue on their way to the dance floor. It was giving value

Eventually he isolated one of the hotter girls and went into rapport-mode. I didn't get to hear what he was saying

Anyway, or a smoother version of ImKumarYo (our resident approach machine). Tyler Durden is Super Saiyan Level 3.

1364145499.0,1ax5y8,Emotions versus Logic: the Biggest Mistake Guys Make with Women,EricDisco,375,54,27,"One of the biggest mistakes guys make

For a woman to get involved with you, take action, even if that means simply responding ‘yes’ to your initiatives. That initiative is *always* based on her feelings. 

The decision to *not* date you may be a logical one or an emotional one. For example

But no matter how logical she is, she won’t say Yes. Why?

**Ultimately, you will *never* feel it. She can envision feeling *less*, but she can't envision feeling *more*. If there is no critical mass, it won't happen, no matter how much she logically thinks you may be a good fit for her. 

Her feelings are like riding a horse. If she senses that horse has a broken leg, if her feelings for you are like a bucking bronco, no matter how unruly they are, she can envision those feelings being tamed. This is because that’s always the direction that emotions in relationships move: from unruly to tame. At first, emotions are unruly. Then they become tame.

The biggest shift in thinking for guys improving with women is to start to focus on emotion rather than logically convincing her that you’re a good match for her. Instead of targeting her brain

**So how do we focus on emotion with women?**

You must focus on her emotions in two separate stages: the attraction stage and the connection stage.

**The attraction stage comes first.** When you meet, you are showing her that you are willing to lose her. You are doing small things that indicate to her you are willing to jeopardize the burgeoning ‘relationship.’

* You take risks and act flip

* You joke with her or tease her

* You disagree with her

* You act skeptical of her as a suitor

* You demonstrate that you don’t consider yourself a suitor

If you’ve ever met a woman whom you were genuinely ambivalent about

**The next stage is the connection stage.** Once she’s attracted

In order to get her to reveal her emotions

In order to get her to reveal her feelings

**Going back and forth between attraction and connection**

The attraction stage comes before the connection stage. But you will continue to go back and forth between these two stages. Once you’ve connected a bit, you’ll both concede and connect again.

In a sense, you keep her emotions involved.

It really started when I started reading about Buddhism.  But before you think this is a religious conversion

But yeah reading about it helped me see practically 100% of the stress I felt was self-imposed.  Girls (all people for me) weren't making me nervous

I still had issues with escalation.  Once again I went back to lowering my expectations.  I told myself, you're having fun anyway!""  Despite saying that, though I still felt nervous going in for a number or a kiss.  But my own personal LMR was alleviated just by telling myself how good it will feel to go after what I want; not to get what I want, but just to go after it.  To feel like a boss and be that guy who just says to himself, ""I'm going to kiss her now.""  Even when you don't get what you want with that mentality, you still feel like you won.  I receive positive reinforcement even when I don't get a number or kiss because I already got something out of it just by trying.

Another thing that happened is I lost about ten pounds by not drinking soda.  I do look thinner in my face

There it is, but this time it seems different.  Maybe this stuff can't be explained and it was just my time to get it.  But I don't think that's the case completely.

Hopefully this helps someone.  I'm obviously not doing this for karma as a self post.  I just want to help.  I know how much better I feel than I did even a month ago,False,,t5_2qhrv,1343065790.0,,,t3_x0xep
1333077023.0,rkcz7,How to Make out,baianobranco,388,68,125,"I noticed a lot of people lately have been complaining about the lack of concrete tips that go beyond inner game/building confidence.  Here I have make out tips that have been working extremely well for me and are fun to do.  I'm not here to teach you how to go in for the kiss/make out (hint:  just go for it!)

Ok...so you're making out with her.  First, hips, stomach, breasts, neck and face/jaw (not necessarily in that order) to keep the kissing fun and dynamic keep moving your hands over different parts and not in a predictable order. 

Occasionally pull her in so that your crotches are touching, but you don't need to say anything.  If you do say something, keep your voice soft, low, and slow and then resume making out.

You can also use the push/pull method in your actual kissing.  After you have pulled away and pause go in for a full lip kiss

Here is my favorite tip, grab the hair and pull her head back sharply.  DO NOT yank her hair, or hurt her, but you do want the movement to be quick and assertive.  She will *practically always* (literally 100% of the time for me) let out a small gasp, similar to a sexual moan.  Now her eyes are facing up and her neck is completely exposed to you.  Without missing a beat from the head pull begin kissing and sucking on her neck assertively.  The neck is actually one of the most erogenous zones on the body.  Girls love this, and it turns them on, while simultaneously making you feel like a bad ass for having the balls to be assertive and command the situation.  Plus it feels great to hear her give that little moan.

Good luck guys

This is probably old news to most of you

When I was younger I stressed a lot about whether I should ""make a move."" The worry was that if she wasn't interested I would look like a fool. Also there was the fear of ""going too far.""

I haven't really kept count but in the last year I've ""made a move"" on probably 40+ women on the first or second date. Every single time the response was positive. Some were totally DTF right then

Not a single one of them was disgusted/angry/upset that I tried to have sex with them. Not one of them stopped responding to messages/calls after the date. 

Of the women who did stop me before we had sex

**So the message here is clearly that you should escalate

Now with that said these are all women I've already built good attraction and kino with and spent a few hours together. I doubt you'll get a very good response trying to make out with random strangers

**TLDR Stop worrying about what this or that sign means and just make a move**

Edit:
Let me clarify this post a little bit. The term ""escalation"" can mean a number of different things. In the context of this post I am specifically talking about going for the kiss and then progression from there to sex. 

I am NOT talking about kissing someone you just met five minutes ago. I am NOT talking about chasing a girl around trying to grab her hand after she's clearly showed that she's not interested. 

This post is specifically for the situation where you've already built attraction

To the experienced guys here it's a no-brainer that you'll be perfectly fine escalating physically with a woman who is attracted to you and comfortable with you.

**I'm addressing those who have the fear that if they go ""too far"" or move ""too quickly"" that it will turn the woman off. If a woman is into you

**Let the girl stop you. If she hasn't said no then you should always keep escalating physically. A girl will stop you when you reach the point that she has decided that's as far as she will go - RIGHT NOW.

And I'd like to share my story because I really feel like it could help someone else out.  It's a long read

So my whole life I've been a nice guy.  In high school I was the guy all the girls loved as a friend but nothing more.  I always felt misunderstood for my niceness,"" but I was also a pushover and fairly weak-willed.

After moving to college I decided that wasn't for me anymore.  I wanted to get laid, that didn't really go well at all. For the next few years I actually regressed.  I looked at flirting as pure manipulation and relationships as a power struggle.  The more PUA I read the more dating felt like some mind game/tug-of-war match. It made me hate the game.  Furthermore, I found instead of girls only wanting to be my friend that now they didn't want to be around me at all.  I started growing hateful and misogynistic, feeling like women were all out to lead men on and hurt me.  I also kind of gave up on PUA as something that would work for me.

Then in the last few months, I started finding confidence in who I was.  But I also found I wanted to be a nice guy again.  I shot down the notion of being nice, remembering the ageless saying, but then my counter-intuition took hold.  I thought, ""Inner game taught me it is more important to be genuine than alpha."" So despite what others told me, I decided to go for it, realizing that it may make me go back to the frustrating friend zone.  But this time I promised myself I would at least try to be different.

What I decided is I was going to be the nice guy, sometimes often, but only if they were sincere.  I would do favors for people, sometimes even large favors, but only because I enjoyed doing so.  Furthermore, I wasn't going to be asexual towards these women anymore.  I would give these girls looks that made them realize I was a very sexual creature.  I would talk to them in a tone that gave them no choice but to realize I was a man.  I would initiate physical contact, even to a very high level of intimacy without making a big deal of it.  But most importantly, my goal was to make myself and others as happy as possible.

Since doing this my results have been, hooked up, and just flat out connected with more women in the last month or two than I have in the last year or two before that, if not longer.  Somehow I became a central hub of socializing with people at work, when I've usually considered myself more of a loner.  Girls who I thought I was never their type are suddenly coming up to me putting their hands around me, asking me to hang out with them and stuff.  Even when a girl does like me as just a friend they seem to not be opposed to being sexual with me too.  I've recently even starting seeing one of these girls as a friend with benefits, and to be completely honest I've never had enough game to have one of those before!

I'm not trying to say everyone should do what I did.  But if you are naturally a giver, too.  The only few things I suggest are:

1.  Be nice to everyone

2.  Say no when you want to or when you feel like you may just be getting taken advantage of (some people are users

3.  When complimenting, don't be afraid to tell her so (you don't have to, but you can if you want).  Just don't feel like you shouldn't say it.

Anyway, just do it for yourself and you will be satisfied.

In closing, and hopefully this can help someone else out there accept their inner kindness while still maintaining a high level of sexuality.  Nice guys can finish first!",,False,,t5_2qhrv,1337974191.0,,

So last night I decided to get some practice, and wandered in.  

I was intimidated by any group of girls that had a guy with them, and got the conversation going.  One girl had a barbell piercing right in between her huge tits.  She said she liked my  personality and that I was cute.  I ignore the piercing for a while then ask her about it.  She literally took my hand, and made me feel the bar under the skin...  Then she was making fun of a girl sitting a few feet away for wearing a short, tight dress that looked like it was made of electrical tape.  First chance I got, I turned around and starting talking to that girl.

Turns out electrical tape girl was Brazilian, and then about her accent.  She was very tipsy, and very touchy feely.  I was grabbing her ass within 5 minutes of meeting her.  

The conversation started to die, but as I turned around I realized that some other guy had already moved in on the hot Brazilian.  I took a seat at the bar and discreetly pinched her ass while coyly looking away.  She ruffled my hair, and made this other guy BUY ME DRINKS for the rest of the night.  He dragged her onto the dance floor, and she turned around to me and winked..  I waited a bit and went out to join them.  As soon as she saw me, she ignored him and grinded on me.  We eventually made it back to the bar, which was closing soon so I said I was leaving.  She took my phone without asking, and put her number in it.  I pointed to my cheek and she gave me a wet sloppy kiss

I expected to get frustrated and be alone all night.  Holy fuck

After seeing [this video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLlKnXx1p2c) I thought I'd give it a try.

But first

I'm part of the generation in their 20s who grew up through their teens texting girls or talking to them via MSN chat

And I realised why, I become a nervous wreck and eat lots of peanut butter. When she texts back, I'm over this, and can't be arsed to get back into the zone of talking to her.)

So now. If I like a girl after # closing

Usually during the interaction

THEN I call her. When? Once I left it till 3 days

I didn't say ""Oh hi HB

I said

Better than a bunch of ASCII digits on a device smaller than my hand. People who get F closes from texting

So if you've been getting flakes after texting

So the movie is about halfway in and the only touching that went on was between our knees. She wasn't running away, a good 20cm away from the center of the couch, there was just no way for me to make a move without saying something- so I looked at her and I said ""hey, are you hot over there?"" and I patted the free space between us. I think she got the hint, because she moved right beside me and put her hand on my knee. I think I complimented her long hair then, as I wrapped my arm around her.

Movie finishes. Damn I wish I hadn't closed my laptop

*Sidenote on Joao Gilberto: download that shit it's good with women when you want a chill, try Avishai Cohen or Idir. When you want something more fun and upbeat, try Chromeo: I've only met one woman who didn't care for that band, and she was a little cray.*

So we're still in shock by the ending of the movie and the ending credits are going by. I will take this opportunity to say that if there's one thing you need to master in conversational skills

I gave this girl a bit of my well-practiced silence, I dove in and explored her amygdala with my tongue. (Is there an antonym for ""euphemism""? I think this qualifies.)

She almost-accidentally ended up sitting on top of me and I undid her bra. I then proceed to peel her like an onion (we live in a somewhat nordic country where it's customary to wear clothes...). She stops me before I can take off her shirt

Oh shit. Challenge accepted. I like it when they you have to work for them a little.

I say something along the lines of ""I would never have thought anything like that"" but I don't think it matters what I said. I leaned her on the couch and started making out with her. This is where the old couch trick comes into play. I make myself fall off the edge of the couch and try to make it seem as real as possible. I think I did fairly well. I appeared off balance and startled for a brief second

And she said ""sure"" with a little smile. Well orchestrated!

1357779006.0,16a7tz,[FR] UPDATE To that Cold/Mean Girl and the first (maybe last) date.,throwawaythxk,521,212,212,"**UPDATES BELOW**

As a followup from this post:  http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/162hxy/approaching_a_mean_or_cold_girlits_like_the_whole/

I set up the date in a single text on Monday afternoon to give her a day or two to be thinking of me and the date.

Monday Afternoon Text:

Me: Let's grab that coffee Wednesday night

Her: I have class till 6 but that's fine

Done. I'm not going to confirm it. She can wonder for a couple days. This isn't the girl who I'd text back a, she gave me a time that works for her, it's done.

Wait a couple days.. and now to confirm.

**Wednesday Afternoon Text:**

Me: I'll pick you up at 7:00

Her: Oh my. Sounds good

I've piqued her interest, gentlemen.)

I doubt this girl has ever been taken on a nice date by a guy with goals

Want to hear about the date now? Oh wait

No, FWB, or ONS.

Frankly, this could get difficult.

Upvote this post for visibility. That original post got 250 points and I said I'd update a few people. I'm a man to my word



*Forget karma

**EDIT: Alright

Let me start by saying

I didn't know enough about her in my first post to come to that conclusion

You guys might not find her crazy

She's materialistic 

She knows she has issues

She's somehwat ""proud"" of them

She's intimidated by my texts

She's reasonably good at ice skating


Immediately when I picked her up

Me: ""So do you have any idea where we're going?""

Her: ""No

Me: ""Okay

I took her to coffee first, ""How many stops are there?"" so naturally, I decided to say, ""Well that depends on when I feel like taking you home.""

The ball was in my court

We got back in the car and headed downtown, and she's proud of it. We bantered casually, but I had to seriously question her morals and ethics. This girl has never worked for anything a day in her life, never earned a dime, and is damn proud of it.

Frankly

Anyways, so I just kind of went with it. I felt like the only words in my head were repeating themselves after everything she said, ""Are you fucking serious?"" She was. Every time.

So we ice skate

We finish up, I gave her an ultimatum. ""You have two options. I can drop you off now, or we can grab a 6-pack and kick it at my place up the street."" 

I got a measly, ""I'll grab a 6-pack for me and then take you home."" She was a little bit shocked, and I told her to wait in the car.

I get back in and go straight to my house. We go in, and take her up to my room. We crack a beer, I put on some music and started some more casual conversation. She kept contradicting herself, and it was like pulling teeth to get anything worthwhile out of her. I would call her out whenever she sounded absolutely nuts. Once again, she was fucking proud of herself and didn't give two shits.

I went to grab another beer and she made some smartass comment

Every time I saw her look at the clock or her phone

So it's getting late, ""Let's get you home."" 

We pile back into my car, ""run along."" As soon as she shut the door I drove off.

My thoughts: This girl isn't in fact ""proud"" of her upbringing, well, everything. She's just dealing with all of this the only way she knows how - getting what she wants.

There is a bar I go to that has about 5-15 puas in a given night. Sometimes I talk to them for a minute, most of them are there for mental masturbation and ego validation seeking, and get absolutely no results, except for maybe 1 or 2 out of 15.

So here are the tips

1. When you're out at night
2. Stay away from people who talk about pick up when they're out at night
3. Don't bullshit yourself, build connections, and escalate)
4. Don't think what you could have done, but a symptom of a bigger problem: lack of sexual confidence, not being assertive, conversation, etc..
5. You can not win every girl, or which aren't. If you're not getting rejected, you're not pushing yourself or being assertive enough.
6. Do not stand around doing nothing
7. Don't bullshit yourself with ""I'm just here to have fun"", you're bullshitting yourself. Also don't bullshit yourself with theory and talking to other people about it (like in point 3.)
8. Don't eject, you need to work through your comfort zone and that's the best way to desensitize it.  The goal should be to open a set, build a connection, find out how DTF they are, get logistics, escalate, and then try to bounce them. If they are not DTF/bad logistics, rather than being in the set for too long
9. Only way to get better is to desensitize your fears, at least 20-30 approaches a week. When you're out at night, try to do 3-4 approaches per hour. Once you overcome one fear, you will find another fear, you need to keep on pushing yourself outside of your comfort zone, that's the only way to improve, no theory can do that for you.

I can't think of any other place that has the same reputation for being a ""No Approach"" zone. Even funerals would probably be considered more appropriate for pick-up in the eyes of some. But after being a member of various gyms for years, I finally made my first approach.

The girl was wearing earbuds while doing an ab workout. I always finish up my workouts with light stretching anyway, and she was just choosing random exercises. When I asked for her number she blushed and literally got up and ran to the locker room to get her phone. I added her number and ejected so she could get back to working out and texted her a half-hour later with my contact info.

I kept the texting to a minimum from then on until I could set up a date, hit up a cool bar nearby and I showed her how to play a drinking game. I offered her a breath mint and she said, ""What, you think you're gonna kiss me?"" I smiled and said, ""Yes,"" grabbed her by the scarf and pulled her in for a quick makeout.

1350947975.0,11wqpa,The 3 dates game,Aloss,404,95,104,"So here i am again with the second great advice my friend gave me if you are interested in the first read [THIS](http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/11v8ks/a_great_advice_a_friend_gave_me_to_help_me_to/).

The 3 dates game: This as you may have guessed is a ""slow"" attraction building and its also great to get to know the girl you are interested with in a ""safe way"". Since you let the tension pretty much to built itself and i find it as a great technique for people that are struggling with AA

I have been using this with girls i have already know

Also this ""game"" works well for places that are not naturally picking up places like clubs/bars, the street literally anyway you want.

**THE BUILD UP:** You meet this girl, and what my friend and i always do is being funny not flirty but funny, learn a few silly jokes, *bitches love silly jokes*, i for one hated this silly jokes thing i'm a more of a cynic dark humor joker, but unless the girl is the exact same as you in your humor 9 of every 10 times they will be put off by this dark sense of humor.


So back to the build up, but just that don't inquire more about her, and she will ask you what you do/like in return, just to make small chat too, if she does not ask, just state what you do and 1 thing you like, but just that, and then after a few minutes (not more than 30), she will give it to you, ""hey lets go tomorrow to X place

EXTRA NOTE: This is also a very good way of asking people you already know


**THE FIRST DATE:**So what happened? you just got yourself a date, *JUST HAVE FUN* that's right you are the place you like and don't focus on making the moment for her of even build up attraction, you just have fun and invite her to be part of YOUR fun, you keep Kino to a minimun, don't complement her if she looks good, not even if she really dressed up really nicely to the date, tease her in a jokingly way, but don't hold her hand, because you are deciding what are you doing and in result you are having a lot of fun. After a point you will start to do some RAPORT not much, or a caffe

* What happens here, but what will you do now?, you will wait at least 4 days to ask her out again. And this is because you will remain in her head for all those days, why did ALOSS invited me to a date (because believe, you did not said it was a date, but it was a date in her eyes), why did he not said i was pretty, and the more a girl thinks of you
This is extremely more effective with hotter girls, to try to get into her pants, but not you, you are different you are a guy that in a couple of days made her life more fun and interesting, and she wants a guy like that in her life.

* Some people will say, no no no, FUCK THAT, a friend-zoned guy is an AFC who from the start did things to please her, that puts her needs as a priority instead of his, a chump whom constantly qualifies her, just to try to keep her around, who does not stand up from himself.


After the first date and in between the days before you ask her out, don't be a dick, just if she calls let her make the conversation, because  if she is calling you is a pretty strong IOI, so let her qualify herself making her keep the chat going, but not more than 5-10 minutes at the time, remember you are busy, use this rule wait at least 15 minutes after the first text to respond, you take 2)

**THE SECOND DATE:** You are doing pretty fine so far, and for the past couple of days, the only thing she thinks about is you.
So after at least 4 days, i want to see you"".

You invite her now to a ""date place"" restaurant, take space a more in depth RAPORT, kino building, you done with the first place, take her to a walk, hold her hand or put your arm for her, you are taking the attraction she already has for you and create now sexual/romantic attraction for you. You could go later to a bar, don't want the alcohol blind you

*  This is where my friend and i differ a little bit, not make out just a romantic perfect kiss, to end a perfect night in her eyes.

*  Also at this point you could also skip to date 3, end the night with just the kiss, make that night a perfect romantic night in her memory, believe me she will be telling that story to everyone, the perfect romantic night with the most awesome guy she ever met.

**THE THIRD DATE:** The set up for the third date is fairly simple, this is not really a date, she will come to your place, and immediately jump you, the three times I've done this literally they jumped the moment i closed the door, i tell them we are eating and watching a movie at my place, but we never get to that.
If you don't live alone, what the third date is all about is intimacy, been alone, just you and her.

And my brothers, mate she will be yours.


Later today i'll try to post a [FR] of the HB9.5 i mentioned earlier

1341842252.0,w9q01,Wondering whether you should ask a girl out?,itsmevichet,392,93,111,"This one's for the absolute beginners

Do you find yourself wondering about a girl and whether to ask her out?

Just do it.

I'm serious.

Just DO it.

Did you come up with a list of things that makes you think she's attracted to you? Or a list of reasons you don't think she's attracted to you?

Well

Ask the girl out.

She doesn't have to have LTR relationship potential if that's not what you're looking for.

In fact, because there's no way to know if she's got any of those things if you don't make a move and spend time with her. If you can't see how she behaves in that context, you've got nothing on her. She is a face, and a name, until you get to know her.

You won't get to know her unless you spend time with her - women can say lots of things about themselves. There's no way to know if she's bullshitting if you don't ask her out.

How many of you start out thinking ""I'd really like to ask this girl out because she's a really good fit for me - she gets my humor

I'm happy for you, but seriously, if you haven't made a move yet, all you have is a list of things that you like about a girl.

Make. A. Move.

Call it a date. Call it a meet-up. Call it a box social

Nothing very noteworthy about the interaction itself. I'd talked to the girl a few weeks ago
Saw her again this last Friday at about 1:00 AM at the same bar. She was with some friends. I'd been seriously out-of-state, said I was attracted to her, but was not looking for a girlfriend, but just a fuck-buddy. She said she'd not done that before, only had boyfriends. I asked if she wanted to try it, she said yeah I'll go home with you but no guarantees. Zero kino so far and one kiss attempt rejected. I also tell her I'm a virgin. About 1:30 AM she tells her friends that she's taking me home and we leave. I stay farther away, so we head to her place. Discuss some life philosophy on the way. No LMR. I couldn't get a good hard-on, but got her to come orally/digitally (technique learnt from watching a lot of porn). Tried masturbating but couldn't get that done either. Fingered her ass a bit. She suggested I stay over and we go to bed (I couldn't sleep actually). Next morning I get her off again

The next couple of days, possibly due to the now-certain knowledge that I can get a girl to come consistently.

Tangentially, look a lot better, possibly got a great job offer and have made peace with my life.

I was playing a game called Humans vs Zombies. It's basically a glorified game of tag played across a college campus. My friends and I were cutting through a parking lot to get home when we saw a group of people who weren't playing

One of the guys shouts ""I bet you can't hit me from there!"" He's about fifty yards away. I pulled out my pvc-pipe blowgun and took a shot - missed by a couple inches. While retrieving my dart

Here's my little victory. The guy I almost hit comes up and interrupts by saying ""Man you sure know how to blow, winked and said ""What are you doing tonight?"" 

The guy was literally dumbfounded - he just kinda stuttered for a few seconds - and the girl laughed. Awesome! I talked for another minute with the girl and left.

She had a big grin on her face and said she would help me out and we sat and talked to a group of girls for a while and my friend left while I chatted for a bit. They were fun as well but the conversation started dwindling so I told them to have a good night and left. I started to walk outside and saw my group of friends in the corner so I started to walk their direction; the girl that liked me saw me coming and started walking toward me. I thought she was going to the bathroom so I began saying there was a line but before I could get any words out she grabbed me and started making out with me in the middle of a huge crowd of people who all stopped and began cheering us on. My. mind. was. blown. I would not have anticipated that in a million years. She kept saying how much I was driving her crazy with the way I was acting and that she felt the urge to basically attack me. We made out for a bit and then rejoined our group like nothing happened while they stared at us with huge grins.

After this I approached a few more groups and found a really cool set of girls at the end of the night to hang with and I focused in on the one I was sitting next to who was very cute. Once again I made myself conscious of maintaining eye contact and smiling. It must have worked because she seemed to get increasingly more into me. Also

**The Idea**


Self-proclaimed nice guys think that girls love douches.  Of course, you can be nice, and still be GOOD with women.

**Wait


When you think about it, usually due to a lack of confidence.  Dishonesty isn't very nice.  Meanwhile, she assumes you're not interested at all, and friendzones you, then you get pissed when some other guy comes along and sweeps her off her feet by making his intentions clear.  **Newsflash: You can be nice and make your intentions clear.**


**OH GOD


First off, and you need to be OK with this fact before you move forward.  

**So What Do I Do?**


When you're interacting with a girl that you're interested in, or be her stepping stone.  There's plenty of resources on inner game here, start looking it up.  Go listen to David Wygant.

**My Experience**


From what I see and my own nice guy experience, there are millions of single gals out there all waiting to meet you.

**I Got Shit To Do


Girls aren't attracted to douches, I'm no master with women, but I've made strides without changing who I really am and you don't have to become someone you hate simply for girls.

1334437836.0,s9y3l,The Definitive Guide to Body Language,,381,86,57,"Thanks for all of the positive feedback on my [last post](http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/s9m4b/the_definitive_guide_to_confidence/)

First, that's the exact confidence I was speaking about.  Calling it definitive says ""I know I'm right, and until one of you proves me wrong, I'll assume I know what I'm talking about.""  Luckily, I do know what I'm talking about.  

HAVING CONFIDENT BODY LANGUAGE IS NOT MIMICKING CONFIDENT BODY LANGUAGE.  I'll repeat that: HAVING CONFIDENT BODY LANGUAGE IS NOT MIMICKING CONFIDENT BODY LANGUAGE.  If you are comfortable in your own space you will have confident body language.  That's what body language is all about


I'm going to start with core conceptual stuff

Let's talk body language.

--------------------

A quick note on personal space:  This varies by country


**CONCEPTUAL MATERIAL**

**--The 4 Tenets of Confident Body Language--**

1. Be comfortable in your own space. 
2. Control your own space. 
3. Be comfortable extending your personal space.  
4. Be comfortable inviting someone else into your own personal space.  


Memorize that.  Let's talk about each one now.

**1. Be comfortable in your own space.  
**
This one is pretty straight forward.  You need to be comfortable in your own space

This is the classic body language of a person so awkward, uncomfortable in their own skin.  You need to free yourself of this.  Talk with your hands.  Make sure the sound comes from your mouth, but gesticulate to enhance your stories.  

*A quick note on pointing*:  Point.  Not with your index finger.  Form a circle with your index and thumb, and pinky in a direction with your forefinger and thumb forming a ring.  That's dominant body language.   

You need to be comfortable in your space though.  Don't cross your arms.  Wave your arms outward when gesticulating

That is your space.  You own it.  Be comfortable.  Take your jacket off and put it on the chair behind it.  You just annexed more space.  More on that in # 3.  

**2.  Control your own space. ** 

Everything that happens in your space should be your doing.  You can invite people into your space, your space will never be encroached upon purposefully.  But, in the same way you should be comfortable in your own space, you should be comfortable with allowing it to change.  Standing, sitting, laying down, all of these actions change your space.  This goes to number three.

**3.  Do not be afraid to extend your personal space. ** 

Lebensraum motherfucker.  You need what you need.  Take up more room than others, in general.  You take up more space.  I'm no evolutionary biology science man, and correct me if I'm wrong, but I believe I read this is a primal element of alpha-male dominance.  

**4. Do not be afraid to invite someone else into your own personal space ** 

To be clear, they are not entering freely.  That's not to say you have a gate, and unexpected visitors are unwelcome.  But by and large, you should be responsible for bringing people into your personal space.  They do not just wander in when they want.  You own your space.  Again, it's hard to explain this concept without making it sound like a symptom of autism.  You like to be touched, you touch a lot, reciprocated kino is ok, approval, and supervised.  

Remember these core concepts.  They should be behind your every physical action.  

If you pull these off confidently, I can promise your body language will come off as fake, forced, and disingenuous.  Please just work on being comfortable.  It's almost counter-intuitive, but good body language is more conceptual in regards to comfort than it is about emulating specific actions.   
------------------------
Read Joe Navarro's ""What Every Body is Saying""  
**Physical Body Language**

Standing Up:

1.  Get your hands out of your pockets.  They should be at your sides, but COMFORTABLE.  
 
2.  When you talk

3.  Unless a contextual reproductive action

I can go more into specifics


Sitting down:

Go watch Mad Men.  Sit like Don Draper.  
1.  Primarily speaking

1.  Sit.

2.  Rest your left ankle on your right knee.

3.  Put your left arm at your side

--Reverse if necessary this so your open arm goes towards the girl

Obviously


3.  Walking

Look where you're going.  Take comfortable steps.  Probably a little longer and a little slower than you're used to.  Do not goose-step.  Girls aren't big on that any more.  

4.  Talking:

Humans are story tellers.  Talk.  Gesture.  Smile.  Not with your mouth.  With your eyes.  If you think about smiling with your eyes a more natural mouth smile will come out.  You're awesome.  You're interesting.  By happy.  Be awesome.  Sunshine and lollipoops.

4.1  Talking when eating

Chew your food first.  Make her wait.  Hold up your index finger to say ""one sec please.""  Smile.  It's a lot better to have 10 seconds of silence than it is for you to chew your food while you talk.

seriously. look this out:

:: She opens every kind of group.  When we take her to a walk, but for her, those people doesn’t really matter. She will just keep walking and having her time.

:: She plays by her own rules. If we take her to a walk in the park, we got to catch her first. 

:: Always with good energy. Lots of times

:: The amount of fucks she gives is about none. Do you guys think she cares when we have to remember her that she is a dog and have to go out or that she can’t do this or that? She will just keep being awesome in another place and give zero fucks about being scolded. Join r/howtonotgiveafuck/ and be a mofo honey badger too.

:: Listen to people, watch and adapt with the signs people gives to you.

This was a reply from a most a made about a date that went poorly for me on Friday ([here](http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/16ge70/her_vs_your_idea_of_her/)). While I read all the replies and took what I could away from each of them it was the words above that stuck with me

The scene was a small university bar where a DJ set was playing. I had a lot of things working in my favour going into the show

A bit of background: this girl had a thing for me but I was beta in my behaviour and after many hours together studying in library I ended up in the friend-zone and she ended up with a boyfriend.

I walked up to her with zero hesitation and gave her a big hug. She responded well as we began to exchange the typical conversation of ""what have you been up to lately"". The difference this time was my frame

*""Yep""*

And with that I grabbed her hand and led her through the crowd into the back of line. We started chatting some more and just as the conversation starts to dull that aforementioned receptionist and her merry band of hotties show up and all give me a hug (hello social proof). At this point my original girl takes off to find her friends and I tell her we will pick this up later. 

I'm going to fast forward to the end but overall the show was great. I was talking to multiple groups of people

So now the show is winding down and people are starting to leave. I look over and see my original girl standing with a group of friends and it looks like they might be heading so I spring into action. I walk directly over to her and looking firmly into her soft eyes say. 

*""Give me your number""* 

*""Why do you want my number?""* (certainly a test to see if I would revert back to my former beta ways) 

*""Because I fucked this up when we were in university and I will not let that happen again""* 

Her jaw drops like a nine pound hammer

I stand there for maybe thirty seconds until I basically tackled from behind. I turn around and guess who

**She will forgive you for being too aggressive



I start ramping up the sexual touching almost to see how far I can go. At one point she stops me and pushes me back slightly and says.

*""Hey you are getting a bit aggressive there mister""*

*""I know""* pregnant pause *""and you don't want me to stop""* 

She flashes me an adorable little smirk

Unfortunately I didn't get her home that night as her friends swooped her away shortly after that exchange but we have already set a yoga date for next week

**Be self-amused

Now, or clicking my heels when I'm walking down the street. And when you are having that much fun, you'll get that energy back from everyone you talk to! It's AMAZING to see a cashier's day be totally made just by you asking how they're doing.

Let me tell you about my 45 minute lunch break at the mall today:

I walk to the food court to get some Greek food. I see someone behind the counter that I see there all the time. I smile at him and say 

""Hey buddy! Good to see your face again! Hook me up with some Pork Souvlaki!"" 

He smiles and says ""you've got it my man!"" 

""Do you guys have an employee discount here?""

""Didn't you ask that yesterday?""

""Never hurts to ask! I'm gonna keep asking till the day I that 10% off!""

He laughs again and I'm on my way. I go to Booster Juice to get a smoothie. The man behind the counter seems to have a dull expression

After eating my meal, an HB7 came up from behind and asked how much she said the hand cream was. So I said ""$20. Hey, actually, wanna help me pick out a good scent for my step-mom?"" She said ""Sure!"" We stood around smelling the different creams for a few minutes, and then I got her talking for about another 5 or so minutes after, telling me about how she was going to Columbia in a few days, and talking about living apart from her family. It was amazing that a complete stranger would begin talking about family life after just five minutes of meeting! I probably could have #-closed then

I went into a specialty tea store after that. The girl behind the counter (HB8) had a Santa hat on when no one else did and was very energetic. We immediately connected. I said:

""Hey there! So listen

""Oh! I feel you on that one! Here let me show you a couple!""

""Right on! Do you do any meditation yourself?""

""No

""Woah! That's awesome! You totally know what that enlightened mindset is like don't you? I meditate too

We chatted for about 10 minutes as she helped me pick out a tea. She was fucking COOL. And I think me being in that energetic and happy state of mind brought some more of that out in her. Didn't #-close because she was surrounded by her co-workers and didn't want to make it awkward for her. But if I see her again in the mall

And that all happened in 45 minutes.

I think the most important thing here is that I really made a lifestyle change. Talking to everyone isn't something I actively think about anymore, and I never used to feel that way.

**LESSONS:**

* be a ""happy mirror"". Be positive and outgoing to everyone from the get-go

* Amuse yourself as much as possible. You'll find others are amused as well.

* If someone is wearing a name tag

* As soon as you decide that every single person is interesting in their own way

I've also used my umbrella when closed as a prop for a whole host of other things. For example, so that it was touching her ass. With an arm on each side and the umbrella behind her, she's got nowhere to go. I've also used the hook of my umbrella to playfully lift a girls shirt a bit (she was joking about how she had a six pack and I said ""oh yea?"" and slowly but surely started to lift her shirt using the handle.

And on the rare occasions that we would have sex, it was painful for her and therefore unenjoyable for both of us. The thing is, the other aspects of our relationship have always been amazing: we're extremely supportive of one another, have great communication, and sincerely love spending time with each other. Part of me felt like I was probably being a bad husband, another part thought it might be a result of the birth control she was on

Five years into our marriage

Then I came across [TofuTofu](http://www.reddit.com/user/TofuTofu)'s [Above the Game](http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/11ng7n/above_the_game_intro_my_story_preview_of_my/), but a week later we found ourselves having the best sex of our marriage (it would have been sooner had it not been for logistical reasons), and now we both know that we want each other, which is leading to more and more sex, with her seducing me again as well. 

Looking back, I had stopped clearly communicating my desire for her and treating her in ways that she found attractive. Specifically, I had stopped maintaining eye contact, gradually escalating kino, and taking charge of setting up dates with her. As a result of all of this, I had let myself get friend zoned by my wife, and we both felt awful for it. 

Now though, there is nothing better than knowing without a doubt that the woman you love more than anything else in the world wants you, and wants you bad, and having her show it enthusiastically.

1367249072.0,1dcbhi,Some bullet points for your Monday,itsmevichet,354,62,49,"Here are some insights I've picked up over the years in ""the game

Some are for beginners

Hope they help in some way.

**BEGINNER SHIT**

* **Most people who need game and learn about game eventually give up**. The overwhelming majority of those cases, don't be one of these people. Every time you find ""a reason that something isn't working,"" that doesn't change a thing about what needs to be fixed - it just explains why it's broken.
* **This shit takes years.** It's not a spa day. It's not a weekend retreat. It's your life
* **Be friends with women.** Game is not about turning women into ""the enemy."" You may not learn game from women, and the only way you can find that out is by having lots of sex - which means that if you're a beginner, you don't believe me.
* **That said
* **Theory is, you know what you need to do. But, I can read and understand a Wikipedia article about building cars - I'll be pretty shitty at it until I get that 1000th car built.

**INTERMEDIATE SHIT**

* **Stop taking yourself and game so seriously.** This is about fun, it never was about your batting average.
* **Be a leader
* **There is nothing new under the sun about game.** Times have changed, but the baseline of a man and women being in a room and being attracted to each other (or not) has always been the same. This shit has existed for thousands of years. It's only recently been formalized, but the point is that you have to assume that all the ingredients for you to carve out your lifestyle is there already. Stop looking for new answers for a situation that you think is unique to you. Figure it out, and use what you DO know.
* **Fix your emotional issues.** I'm fucking serious here. I've never met a guy who was frustrated enough at life to seek out this kind of advice who didn't have serious emotional issues - myself included. Fix that shit. You'll soon realize that these emotional issues were probably causing most of the problem that you've been band-aiding with game.

**ADVANCED SHIT (if you're already at this point

* **I've found that women and people are by and large a lot more willing to give generously than most people consciously realize.** This is the cornerstone on which society and the concepts of fairness and justice are built. Fairness is entrenched into the human psyche. Most beginners have a skewed concept of it
* **If your self-esteem is high enough (it better be at this point), or to keep running your head into a wall. But, there's an emotional and cognitive payoff for thinking that you can do something about a problem, even if you can't. [We're wired to find meaning, even in mindless tasks.](http://www.ted.com/talks/dan_ariely_what_makes_us_feel_good_about_our_work.html) So, the thing you think is in your control, even if it isn't, even if the real world result is failure.
* **If you have value to offer
* **I have trouble writing lists like this because I don't think about rules anymore.** Yeah, and it's pretty awesome.

Let me preface by saying that I'm pretty much your average guy. I'm 21, some of whom are girls. I haven't kissed a girl in over 9 months.

So here's how the story goes

One day I was browsing Facebook and stumbled upon a girl that I used to know in High School. I hadn't talked to her in over 4 years. Now here's the funny part. I had a HUGE crush on this girl back in High School, etc. I ended the short conversation with something like ""Hey, great to talk to you again. We should go grab a drink sometime!"" and she seemed to approve of the gesture.

A couple days later

Went to her house, but I pulled it off with ease. Quickly re-introduced myself, and he asked a few questions about where I'm going to school, where I'm working, etc. It went great. So after that, my friend comes out and we drive off to the bowling alley. Things are going really well, we're basically just catching up on old news, and joking around.

When we arrived at the bowling alley, this date night is on me."" I think she liked that one.

So we start bowling

After this

So we get in the car and start driving home. I play some pretty upbeat, I'm realizing that she totally wants to hang out again. About halfway to her house, I ask her if she wants to stop by my place on the way home (because I live in a new house). She says sure!

We walk into the house, so it's perfectly ideal. A few minutes later, I pop open a bottle of wine and turn on the music. She takes a seat on the couch and I sit down next to her. We talk for a few minutes, and I started getting closer and closer. I tell her something like ""You're extremely pretty, even more beautiful than you were in High School."" And here we go.......

Kino initiated

So here's my big 3 takeaways from this experience:

1. TIME CHANGES PEOPLE - just because someone didn't like you in the past

2. WHAT DO YOU HAVE TO LOSE? - just send her a text, she responds uninterested.  Best case, she'll find it a nice gesture. Always end the conversation with offering to hang out sometime. This shows initiative and makes her know you're interested in spending some time together.

3. BE YOURSELF, and it's always a fun time. If you show her that you've got a plan in mind and are excited to do it, she'll feed on that energy and also be happy.

So that's it. Like it or hate it. I'm pretty proud of myself. It was an amazingly fun night. Can't wait for the next one.",,t5_2qhrv,False,frflair,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/1h38ub/fr_from_facebook_add_to_fclose_in_two_days/

1327260726.0,orqry,[FR] Gave my friend $160. He would give me back $20 for each approach I did and keep whatever I didn't earn. Made for an exciting night.,Red_Alt,358,72,113,"Last night I tried a challenge that I read about in the PU book

The challenge is to give a friend a large sum of money and then you receive some of that money back for each approach you do. This

I gave a friend of mine $160 with the understanding that he would repay me in increments of $20. That meant I had to do 8 approaches or F-close to get all of my money back.

We took the train into Manhattan and for the whole train ride I was nervous about it. 8 approaches… it seemed like a lot to me.

I only had some whiskey when I was back home and I would not be drinking anything at the bars for the sole purpose of keeping my mind clear.

The first approach was probably the hardest and the worst. The bar was a sausage fest and spare women were rare. I talked to some HB 7.243 at the first bar we went to. She had a bunch of empty glasses around her and I jokingly asked her if she had done all that by herself. The interaction was not good- I wasn’t sure what to say. At one point I asked her what her friend thought of something I said and she said that’s my sister as if I had done something wrong. I said fuck it and collected my first $20.

Then we went across the street to another bar. We sat down with our drinks. My friend had a jack and coke and I had, an 8 &amp; 6, next to me. There was a spinning werewolf mannequin and I said, “guys how awesome is this werewolf!?” I then made forced conversation. Not great. 

$40.

As we were leaving I stopped and talked to a group of three women at a table. I pretended to ask them for advice on good bars in the area (the East Village), though at first they thought it was bullshit. It amazed me how prepared I was from reading the Magic Bullets’ model. They admitted to me that they were like thirty years old after I said they must be, “what 23?” which flattered them. I think they enjoyed the compliment but I guess I could have used more negs. Anyway, we talked to them for 15 minutes and then they left.

$60.

We left the bar and went to a different bar that I had been to before. I opened up a 2 set (8 &amp; 7.5) in the back near the band, completely maintaining my equanimity. Then the 7.5 went to the bathroom and my other friend showed up and we excused ourselves to go meet him. 

$80.

I could have gone back to the 8 and 7.5 but they were an uncertainty and I had more money to make back. We left and went to a new bar. This place was awesome, 6, 6, 7, 7. I opened to the 5 and 6 and after a while they said they were going to the dance floor and invited me. I said I had to go talk to my friends and I’d be out to see them in a minute. 

$100.

I didn’t go to dance with the girls. I had more money to make back. I went with a friend to meet more girls. I opened a two set by introducing my friend with a line from How I Met Your Mother: “Hi, “I love giving myself a challenge. I live for this.” I don’t know why but that calmed me down a lot. Still, I wasn’t gonna close and I didn’t want to. 

$120.

We left and went to the final bar

$140.

One more left.

As I did with the previous 2 set

I quickly got a water and returned.

I came back and she was alone, but it just didn’t feel fluid. She told me my hands were cold and started rubbing them and putting them up to her mouth. I thought she was actually going to start sucking on my fingers. “This is pretty cool,” I thought. 

But then it all went down hill. We kissed a few more times and I felt like it was bad and started to wonder if she thought it was bad too. This started ruining my confidence, got her number and left with one of my friends while the other stayed behind. 

And then the realization and regret started to set in. My friend told me she was so clearly DTF and he was right. Whatever bad confidence I started to develop

I should have gone back but I worried it would be awkward. Five minutes passed and I just texted her: 

This is a VIP #
-Red

She hasn’t responded. Maybe I’ll text her soon. It’ll at least be good practice for my texting game.

Still

$160.



***Critique***

**What I did right:**

I maintained a lot of the principles I’ve been reading about: strong eye contact, kino (which I’m still improving), and keeping a confident posture.

I got to use the best friends test!

And of course I completed all 8/8 approaches. 


**What I did wrong:**

I should have tried to go past just the approach. When I’m drinking, #-close more. 
 
I viewed last night only as an opportunity to sarge. And that’s it. I never looked at it as going past approaching. I don’t know why but I was just in that faulty mindset.

I think I was also worried that if I spent all my time with one group or girl

I could have done better

1370412542.0,1fpfp6,Communicating like a boss. Part 1: Speaking with Clarity.,VMikeL,349,66,20,"I was asked by /u/SedditDisposable a few days ago to try to explain how I self taught myself to be a better speaker

This is a tool that is intended to help you communicate better in future, and not verbatim transcripts. If this sounds like something that could help you, read on: 

&gt;**The What**

Human speech is the main way in which we communicate, it doesn't mean we're necessarily any good at it. Some people stammer, some people speak too quiet, too slow, too fast. The ideal clarity and speed to speak can be found with most News readers and news anchors.

&gt;**The How**

To be able to speak with clarity

**Speak to yourself**

Speak to yourself at full volume. Listen to yourself, how much was difficult, and how much made sense? The great thing about speaking or reading to yourself is that you are able to instantly critique your pace, pronunciation, volume, and clarity, and redo it on the spot. 

**Record yourself**

So you just nailed the pace, you may learn that you actually mumble your words more than you think. You get to hear your voice as it actually is, and not how you hear it in your head. Listening to yourself may be excruciating, but it will teach you to stop ""uhh""ing and ""umm""ing. It also shows your nuances, so you may correct them accordingly. This will teach you how to speak with clarity, correct annunciation, and train you to remove thinking noises (uhh+Umm). 

I do not recommend you practice a speech in front of other people, or they're just a tad ADD while they sit there watching you fumble over yourself. If you know your subject, you should be able to critique your own words. 

Part 2 will come out whenever I write part 2.

Basically this conference is in California


1) **Everybody wants to like you, tell a joke, compiment etc. Realizing this shattered my concept of social hiearchies, even preppy sorority girls with their noses in the air will give you the time of day if you can make them smile.


2) **Be nice through your actions, buying drinks etc. Just be kind with your actions and don't articulate it at all. As soon as you try to demonstrate your kindness through words you come across like you want something. Prove yourself through actions, not words.


3) **Everybody is an asshole.** Asshole is a relative term and everybody on earth has been one in some way at least a handful of times


4) **Build yourself a strong sense of reality.** I watched some of Tyler Durden's real social dynamics. He gave some good advice that finally clicked with me at the conference. He said that women find a strong sense of reality highly attractive. Just think about it. An attractive woman gets approached all the time by douche bags who just want to have sex with her and AFCs who want to be walked all over. Then you come into the equation. A man who isn't afraid to ride solo. You approach her and instead of trying to throw lines at her you are having a legitmately interesting conversation. You are confident and come off as a guy who knows what he wants in life. You seem completely free and the opposite of clingy which is exactly what women want.


But honestly, DO IT. No matter the cost, you only have one life to live, minds well enjoy it.

1294814820.0,f0qzw,8 Epiphanies That Changed My Game,MaysonNSS,362,80,146,"For 3 years I have kept a journal since I started in the community. I have just had my three year anniversary and I wanted to go back and read the things that I have written. Upon doing that I saw so many mistakes that I made and lessons that I learned. I want to sum them up from the perspective of someone who started off in a dark place to someone who now teaches. 

Before I get to my epiphanies I want to explain my journey. 

When I found the community I was going out 7 days a week living at home with my mother not working. I asked opinion openers in the mall and got blown out constantly. I was beginning to think that this stuff didn’t work. Out of desperation I reached out to a Mystery Method instructor named El Topo who much to my surprise connected with me on a personal level. He never asked for a dollar from me but gave me more then I could ever afford. He told me that I had to meet a guy from Boston that goes by the name of Doc Holliday. I talked with Doc on the phone that night and we hit it off. Our views were very much in line and we decided to hang. 

Doc got me into the  local lair and we sarged together. I saw another side of day game that was real
The group of Saffron

**Epiphany #1
There are two types of attraction; Passive (which is body language and looks) and Active (which is being fun

Saffron was like 5ft tall and not very attractive at all

My job with Practical Pick Up taught me how to be a teacher. The guys invested a lot and out of a business grew a friendship. My game continued to grow and so did my passion for teaching. At one bootcamp I met a student who ended up giving me a ride home because he lived a couple of towns away. Jimmy quickly became someone who I admired. He is a father who is very active in his son’s life. Growing up I never had that experience but here was a guy who was divorced

Jimmy quickly became a close friend to me and he became really good with women. This is a guy who was 10+ years the senior of most of the girls he was dating and they loved him. His playful style of game would only get better as time went on. 

At this time I started getting more girls in my life as I went out. I liked this one girl but couldn’t escape the friend zone. At her house one night she told me how she likes this guy. She then said something that became my next major epiphany:

HB: Just because I like him doesn’t mean I want to have sex with him. I can like lots of people but it doesn’t mean I want to fuck them or go out with them.

**Epiphany #2
I left the house that night and learned a very valuable lesson. Girls will fuck guys they don’t want to date and they will like guys they don’t want to fuck.**
 
At this point I decided to invest a ton of time into social circle game. I figured having a friend who was a girl could be a bad thing or good thing
 
I was doing good with the girls

**Epiphany #3
No amount of game will make up for a shitty lifestyle. **

I had the perception of being this high valued guy but I was simply playing a part. I decided to stop all pick up for 3 months and get my shit together. During this time I fixed my life

**Epiphany #4
Game is not about wracking up lays to take vengeance on women for your hurt in life. Game is about improving yourself that you can share your best self with a woman who deserves it. **


From this lesson I decided to only go for girls that I really liked. Wracking up lays was taking a toll on my morals and I felt like such a value taker. I wanted to leave people better then I found them and at this point I wasn’t doing that with everyone I met. 

The next epiphany came as I was talking to a friend. He asked me why I was blowing off these 7s and 8s who were obviously into me. I told him I have really high standards. Then it clicked….


**Epiphany #5
You can ONLY have high standards if you EARN THEM. **


Most guys talk about how they have high standards but they have NEVER been with a girl who was BEAUTIFUL AND high value. These drop dead hot ass girls that most guys say they want most guys have NEVER had. I was making excuses and really didn’t earn my high standards yet. 

So I went for the 8s and only the ones that I really had some sort of connection with. I left them better then I found them and then the 9s seemed to catch on. I began to write these experiences down and how I got good. I taught more and more and finally got the hang of picking up the hot girls. 

I went to Vegas to teach and came back on a high. I started teaching more and more and went to PA then to Canada to teach. Things finally made sense and were working. My job was steady and I moved out into my own place. The transition was tough but at the end of the first month I met a girl who would blow me away. 

I have been in relationships before but once in awhile you meet a girl that you have personal chemistry and sexual chemistry with. We fell hard for each other and rushed into things. This girl had the looks

**Epiphany #6
Chemistry cannot be generated

Scarcity built up inside me as I couldn’t believe this was happening. I was afraid to mess it up and stayed in game mode. This threw me for a loop as this off again on again relationship took a toll on me. I stayed high value all the time and tried to impress her with my worth. This was a massive mistake and one that taught me a lot but cost me even more. This brought me to another very important epiphany when it comes to girls….

**Epiphany #7
The brighter you shine the bigger shadow you cast.**

For so long I was trying to display value to all these girls I came in contact with and I would spend so much time in attraction that I became unattainable in many ways. I learned that if you oversell yourself people are not going to buy. I was spending so much time doing attraction that I didn’t need to do at all and not enough time being an actual person. I fell into the common mistake that I had to look “cool.” Attraction became part of me once I fixed my lifestyle and really got my confidence in order that when I ran attraction on girls it would kill the interaction because they thought that I was just a player at that point. I learned that you can have too much value. This lead me to one of the hardest epiphanies that I have learned and cost me my relationship.

**Epiphany #8
When you don’t stop the game you are bound to lose. **

Jimmy became the teacher to me many times as his wealth of experience in relationships got me through this period of pain. Eventually I had to make a choice and get a resolution for me so I had to let go of the relationship with my girlfriend. I learned that pick up teaches you the “tricks” to getting the girl to go home with you but it doesn’t teach you how to keep her. All these game techniques never stopped when I started dating my dream girl and it cost me the relationship. This was a hard lesson but one that I have never had to repeat. 

There are so many stories, and I am three years into a journey I began with the simple hope of creating social options. Now I sit here with a life that allows me to teach other people these skills. I am blessed 

Thanks for listening to my journey. I hope you find value in this.

**Club Bitches**
[Full Post](http://datingamerican.blogspot.com/2012/04/club-bitches.html)


One of the best investments I've made over the past year is spending a lot of time, and eventually the owner can do wonders for picking up girls. I'll certainly be writing in the future about the exact process I took to basically ""buy"" a club, but for now I'll just say that I'm currently well connected.

One of the advantages I have when I'm at this club is that I have my main bouncer scour the club for potential hotties

A weekend ago I was down there on a Friday night with a relatively large party,"" he joked and gave me a wink.

I grabbed a friend and approached.

""I hear there are some ladies looking for some guys to buy drinks over here.""

""Yeah

""Excellent! We're looking for girls to buy us drinks! This could work out!"" I replied with a smile.

""Buy your own drinks!"" The second girl

""What are you talking about? We're pretty people

""Are you gay? Why are you wearing a suit?"" The brunette responded. That's the best she had. As I've mentioned before I wear suits as a matter of course when I'm gaming. The bluntness of her statement was a disappointment.

To those who decry pick up artists and the seduction community

Don't get me wrong, I'll jump at the chance. But instead you've got dolled-up bitches like this, trolling clubs, looking to take advantage of nice-guys' wallets and bruise a few egos before going home to remind themselves that lifetime told them they're princesses.

I went into battle mode. Why would these girls really act like this? Such poor attitudes

""Why am I wearing a suit?"" I repeated back. ""Why aren't you wearing a suit?""

The brunette looked at me with a disgusted look

I decided to pull out the first gun. ""Oh,"" I began. ""I think women deserve equal rights and should be allowed to wear suits if they so choose!""

""Well... uh..."" She was dumbfounded. She couldn't say she wasn't a feminist. She stammered for a few seconds. ""Well I'm a feminist too!""

""Where's your suit then?"" I prodded.

The blond and my friend were sufficiently distracted in their own conversation at this point.

""Well I mean

""Oh

""What do you do?"" She asked.

I went with my old standby job. ""I'm the garbage man.""

""What? No you aren't! You're lying to me!""

""Well now you're just insulting me! Are you saying that being a garbage man is so ridiculous that you instantly doubt my job?""

""Well.. uh.. no...""

""So garbage men can't put on suits and look fantastic after work?""

""No

""You weren't were you? Ah

""Yeah

I looked past her in the direction she mentioned she was looking. There was one table with a lone guy. Not great looking. ""Oh

""What? No! I wasn't checking him out! You're crazy.""

""It's ok if you think he's attractive. I don't judge. I also don't put down garbage men."" I smiled.

Still

""What is your end-game here? What do you think you're going to get talking to me?"" She sneered.

My god

""What do you think you're going to get out of coming over here?""

""Oh, but a fun little white lie. ""I'm just distracting you so my friend can meet your friend.

""WHAT!?"" She gasped

""Ugly is a bit harsh.."" I replied.

""Oh my god

I decided this was a good exit. I had absolutely no intention of following through with a girl of such a bitchy caliber. I turned to walk away.. but stopped and leaned in to her for one last thing.

""I'm an asshole

Then I walked away.

I later met up with my friend who recapped the girls' conversation after I left.

""He did to ME what WE DO to guys!"" She cried.

Heh. That's my favorite phrase. It's something I've heard a lot recently. Even in a more joking environment, I can't get the best of you. No matter what I say, you always turn it around!""

Music to my ears. Girls acknowledging their game. It's like hearing a politician admit he lies.

Later that night I was on the dance floor when the two girls came up and started dancing on me hard. It wasn't sexy or in good fun

""Why did you do that to my friend? She's really upset.""

""Do what?"" I asked innocently.

""You were a real asshole to her for no reason.""

""I don't agree. I was just striking up conversation

""Well the point is she's really upset.""

""Well

""Well I'm a bitch and I'm ok with it

""Then the best advice I have for you is to stop hanging out with her

Her eyes grew wide in anger. I decided to back down just a little.

""Ok

""What's that?"" She asked.

""I'll be nice to the next girl I meet... if you two be nice to the next guys you meet.""

She looked at me

I managed to be the only guy at the club that was able to captivate their attention the entire night. And I had to do so by being a jerk and getting negative attention. I suppose in some way I probably could've sealed the deal

I wish all girls could take this lesson home. Be nice to guys. We might just surprise you and be nice back.

1329596603.0,pvku3,Nice guys get laid too,,367,85,73,"This is probably nothing new to all you experienced PUAs out there but I wanted to share this knowledge with beginners because I know it would have helped with my learning curve a lot if I would have known it earlier.

**Nice guys get laid too!** There's a lot of PUA material out there and as a beginner it's easy to confuse assertiveness and alphaness with being a dick. Let's be clear

So how do you go from a nice guy who gets stood up to a nice guy who gets laid? Well first I'd like you to ask yourself one thing.

""Am I only being nice as a means to achieve an end?""

You are not a ""Nice guy"" if you are only acting nice because you think it'll make a girl fall for you. Part of growing as a person is about meeting new people. Do you just throw a girl's number away when she says let's be friends? (I hate the term friendzone


Being friends with women can come with some great benefits. First of all you will have a good reputation with her friends, you can join groups a lot easier if you have a girl with you, you can practice flirting/gaming with no consequences if you fail, the list of benefits goes on.


Just because you're friends doesn't mean you can't flirt with her and use game on her either. This is why I say the friend zone doesn't exist, maybe she was in a relationship at the time and as soon as she's out you'll be first on her radar. 

This all ties into the broader subjects of abundance mentality and outcome independence. You should be focused on fun and self improvement, it never hurts to have more friends. The more friends, the more social outings available, the more people to meet, etc.

1356237886.0,15baf7,The Actual Rules of Alpha-Male.,P15Raindrop,353,73,132,"I saw the post earlier about the 55 rules and skimmed over them. Some were fairly good

The alpha-male of ancient times is dead. We live in the 21st century and the rules have changed:

1. RULES: ALL rules are simply guidelines

2. REPUTATION: Your reputation is as important at your persona. If people are trashing you behind your back (for whatever reason that might be) you will have a hard time seducing a woman who has already heard shit about you. I'm not talking about being a womaniser, accomplishments, etc. Build a solid reputation, get people hearing good things about you BEFORE they've even met you, and the job is half done.

3. MORE REPUTATION: Follow through on your words with actions. I cannot stress this enough. If you are the kind of guy who says a lot and does fuck all

4. PASSION: Nurture your passion. Mine is physics. I've cornered a girls before and launched into an explanation of why I chose it as a career, and don't be all ""well, you know, it just my thing"" .....BULLSHIT!!! If you love it, she will see it.

5. OBSERVATION: Pay close attention to, don't go over like a bull in a china shop. Smile first, then approach; her mind will be racing by the time you do. If there is an extrovert, then engage with her, but don't stick to her. Alpha males know what is going on, but aren't involved. Knowing what is going on will help you in making the correct choices. If you get involved with out knowing the score, choices get made for you.

6. GENEROSITY: This is a tricky one to balance, but make sure everybody you buy for knows about it. DON'T say, ""this is from me"" and expect thanks... simply give them the drink and wish them good health, or whatever. It says you appreciate their friendship, but you don't need it. Alpha a fuck.

7. PHYSIQUE: This one is dead simple. Get fit, just keep quiet about your fitness and relax in the confidence that when you get to fuck her, she will be impressed.

8. COMPETITION: This is the tough one. How do you deal with other people in your territory? The first thing you have to do is wake up and realise that you live in a modern civilisation and your territorial rights were relinquished a long time ago in favour of law and order. People are allowed to talk to the same woman that you are talking to and, if you are doing things properly, you will also have many other women to choose from too.

9. EDUCATION: Educate yourself. Read that book you always said you would read. Watch a few documentaries. Try to never (never ever) be stuck for words about something. That doesn't mean 'always give your opinion.' Sometimes

10. CONFIDENCE: Everybody has something to say about confidence. If you have followed the 9 guidelines above, knew what was going on around you, had a solid set of friends, good healthy body, and knew more about the world than those around you... WHY THE FUCK would you not be confident?

TL;DR You can't fake being alpha.

I posted yesterday saying I was going out and would use some of the lines you guys suggested just to have some fun. 
The girl to guy ratio was slim pickings for the majority of the night
This was just for fun and to switch things up a little bit.

I approached this girl with ""Excuse me, what is it?"" I followed up with, ""If I was a watermelon, would you spit out of swallow my seed?!"" She started dying laughing and said, ""Swallow"" and then winked. We talked for a little bit and I made my way around to meet some other people.

I didn't advance with this because I wasn't interested in her to begin with

I saw another girl there and approached asking the same opening line, ""What has 116 teeth and is holding back The Hulk?"" She looked completely puzzled and let out a nervous chuckle and said, ""I don't know, what?"" I replied with, ""My zipper!"" She laughed and smacked me on the arm and said, ""Oh my gosh, you're ridiculous"" Again

There were only two girls there throughout the night that I really would have wanted to advance anything with, take a girl home with me, or anything along those lines. I had a blast cause I didn't care and I was with my best friends and met some new people.

One of my friends wanted to take my out to Cracker Barrel for taking care of him a couple weekends back. I obviously wasn't opposed seeing be Cracker Barrel is fucking delicious.

After about 5 minutes I said, but give me your number and we can continue this some other time!"" I got her number and we left.


I'll probably see what she's doing tonight and see if she wants to go out with me and my friends. The last thing I thought I'd be doing at Cracker Barrel was running game

1350862699.0,11v8ks,A great advice a friend gave me to help me to stop over-analyzing girls.,Aloss,354,77,46,"If you are like me then you know what it feels like to tend to analyze everything around you.
And this conduct you transfer it to the girls too. And it's a really big problem when you try to pick up girls

Some examples:

When you start a conversation with a girl you are always thinking if she is enjoying the chat/been in to you or just being polite.

When you text her and you tend to over-analyze every word of the text.

When she cancels on a date

I used to do this and it is painful

I was doing this
So this little magic piece of advice that a friend gave me is this (in spanish) *""No pienses por ellas""* or **""Don't think for them""** you are not a mind reader just assume the girl likes you and go with the flow.

So simple but yet so powerful words when you start or rather you stop doing that

No more AA do to you thinking ""will she think i'm a creep"" or ""what will she do if i do this"" NO MORE TRYING TO BE A MIND READER AND JUST DO YOUR THING.


SO with this mindset in me i when out the last couple of weeks with a much greater results


So what i feel is a good mantra for people that are getting back on the game like me

Always assume attraction
Just focus on having a good time
And if a girl shows interest in you don't start to over analyze i repeat **DON'T THINK FOR THEM** and just go with the flow.

I hope this little mantra that has been doing wonders for me also helps you guys too.

And i'll be back with another very good advice from the same friend to build attraction with something that he calls ""The 3 dates game""

1303164993.0,gt3he,The Pussification of Men... The World According to Nice Guys.,MaysonNSS,378,104,123,"I was never good with girls in high school. My friends had girlfriends and dates and I never went to prom. I hated the fact that I couldn’t be attractive like they were so I tried to become a carbon copy of my friends. I dressed like they dressed


I figured my mom would have some understanding and so I reached out and asked her what girls want. She told me that they wanted a nice guy. Looking back at those words



The word nice has several meanings depending on the person and gender that you ask. For guys they often confuse nice with supplicating. See a Supplicator is a person who asks for things in a very humble manner. Supplicate comes from the latin supplicāre  meaning to beg on one's knees.  Begging for what you want is a sign of low self confidence and as we all know women are attracted to confidence. 


The word nice translates to pleasing


**The major problem with “nice guys” is that they tend to lie to you the entire time. ** 
There is nothing nice about a guy who is playing a part to get something they want. This nice guy attitude may seem pleasant at first but often times nice guys have ulterior motives.  Nice guys will endure hours of whining and bitching about what assholes men are, lash out and often take vengeance on the unsuspecting women. 


**The nice guy is an illusion that is masked with insecurity
Granted there are guys who want to be friends with a girl but far too often guys use this ploy to be able to “get the girl.” They have an idea in their mind that if they get close to her after awhile she will wake up and figure out she is in love with them.  Afraid to tell the girl their true feelings they mask their intent and create a façade of misplaced chivalry that would make the knights of Camelot applaud. 


It’s time to face reality and learn an important lesson. You will never get what you want in life if you don’t ask. Masking your intent only leads to self deception and sorrow. Guys
Nice guys have many characteristics about them that are ingrained into who they are. Nice guys tend to:


**Seek the approval of others**

**Hold back their true feelings**

**Become uncomfortable when others express strong feelings**

**Give more then they get from people**

**Avoid conflict **

**Don’t like confrontation. **




These are just some of the characteristics of a “Nice Guy” but don’t worry there is hope! Once you recognize this behavior in your own life you can begin to change it. Often time people go to the extreme to change their nice guy behavior and start become jerks to everyone around them. This behavior is also quite destructive and will lead to more frustration on your part. Start by asking for things that you actually want. It’s often said that if you don’t ask the answer is no. You have to face the fact that things will not always go your way when you ask but if you don’t ask the answer will always be no. 
Being a self deceiving “nice guy” is manipulative in every way.  The nice guy flies under the radar because his misguided attention and support seems so genuine. When the person finally shows their true intent it’s often destructive to the friendship. Guys

Then she followed up by asking if I had intended my question as a date

Now here comes the make or break moment. She says that she's taking a break from dating right not

Beta Answer: Sure! OMG! I'm so hardup for any interactions with girls that I'll hang out with you under any circumstances! Plus

Actual Answer: It can't just be as friends

Her response: Okay

Not anything else to report, honesty is always the best policy. If you lie, girls are going to see right through you, and now you're going to look like a lying asshole who's trying to manipulate/trick a girl into liking him, instead of a man who isn't afraid of being a man.

Some background info: I contacted a girl in my city on OKC (I live abroad so options are limited, sometimes three days between messages, but we set up a dinner date for last Monday. It went fairly well, but I could tell she was being very aloof and coy. My first text to her after Monday was on Thursday. I suggested drinks Friday, but she was going out of town. The rest of the convo is here:

Me (2:37 PM): what's your schedule like next week?

Her (2:38 PM) I usually finish work at 4 

Me (2:44 PM): How about a monday dinner? know any good places?

Her (2:50 PM): mondays are usually my least favorite day **Lame excuse**

Me (2:51 PM): you and everybody else. I could cheer you up

Her (2:52 PM): also

Me (4:26 PM): wow dropping ultimatums already. risky business **A fair recovery if I say so**

Her (4:35 PM): I just don't want to hurt your feelings later on =D

Me (6:07 PM): its cute that you're looking out for me

Her (6:12 PM): good to know **Felt like texting further would've come off as clingy and validation seeking

**Saturday**

Her (11:09 PM): hey anything going on downtown tonight? **Unsolicited first text on a weekend

Me (11:12 PM): out of town **I was out clubbing in Seoul, ended up F-closing a girl that night**

**Sunday**

Me (12:49 PM): dinner tuesday at  7?

Her (1:13 PM): not unless you want to come to *her neighborhood* **Feels like another shit test

Me (1:18 PM): there any good places to eat there?

Her (1:25 PM): all food tastes good if you're hungry. I'm sure its the same everywhere

Me (1:48 PM): i'll pencil you in. as long as it doesn't rain I'll drive out there. (driving a scooter in the rain to a date is a bad look) ill text you tuesday **I've got the date

I know it's a bit long, at first. My old habit would have been to play it off and agree to just be friends just because I wanted to continue seeing her, and hopefully be able to win her over by being such a ""nice guy"". I didn't want to just outright say no to friends either, so I found a rather elegant way to just avoid the question.

As far as the timing of my responses, I wait as well. Always texting back quickly makes you seem like you have nothing going on. Particularly with the ""just friends"" shit test, I was at work, so I was actually busy and not thinking about texting her. Texting a girl should *never* take priority over anything happening in your day-to-day life. Fit it into your downtime. I don't take my phone to the gym, and I rarely text at work, usually only on my lunch hour or sometimes during a short break.

I know. It happened to me. Before I learned the techniques of the game I never had any confidence to capitalize on the attention from women. I lusted for a woman's touch. Someone to comfort me. Someone to be with me. Unfortunately, ""I am married and I have two children with a woman who I love, but she does not love me back."" Sadly, I am in this situation. I am now married to the first pretty little thing that I had the confidence to approach and now have a child with her. This, on its own, would not be a bad thing if she was a good person, but like Mystery's friend

I constantly read all about picking up women, the strength to know when to let the fuck go. This stuff is powerful POWERFUL information. It WILL get you women if you keep trying, but without the knowledge and STRENGTH to know when to let go, you are setting yourself up for something MUCH worse than a life alone. You are setting yourself up for a life of depression and agony with a woman who does not truly love you. Know this foreveralones. If you did it once you CAN and WILL do it again. If you ever get the feeling that your woman does not love you, cut those ties immediately. Realize that the loneliness of breaking up is better than the loneliness of a life with her.

TL;DR: Learn when it is time to break up BEFORE trying to pick up women. You need to know BOTH aspects of the game before you begin.

1) Assume she is attracted to you. If you follow other dating rules/etiquette

2) You make all decisions. You may ask her opinion whenever you like

3) Treat her like an equal. She is not better than you, clearly and fairly.

4) If you do something nice or chivalrous, or bring the car around for her. Knowing this intellectually isn’t enough. Practice not doing these things so when you choose to do them, you truly know it’s not out of obligation. The act then becomes genuine, and she’ll be able to tell.

5) Be genuine. Don’t be thinking about game (important

6) Don’t go out of your way to impress her. If you’ve got a lot of impressive things you want to tell her

7) KINO ESCALATION LADDER Remember when I said not to think about game? This is the one thing you’re allowed to remind yourself of over and over. It is fun for both of you. Don’t be afraid.

8) Spread your attention - You’re on a date, check some things out. Enjoy the event.

9) Make fun. This includes a lot. An exercise left to the reader.

10) Smile + Eye contact

**A Yes-Yes Relationship**:  

If you are lucky, or both who are always there for you, and who you are always there for.  The relationships you have with your closest family members are some of the most precious things in the world.  With your mom, it doesn't matter if she was the one who called you last.  It doesn't matter if she paid for dinner.  It doesn't matter if you haven't heard from her in a long time.  You can pick up the phone and you don't even think about the possibility that she might ditch you.  There is no tit-for-tat in the closest, dearest relationships you have in your life.  This yes-yes relationship is what you need to build if you want your relationship to be full of fun and love.

**A Yes-No Relationship**:  
Most relationships you have are yes-no relationships.  Not just with romantic partners, etc.  Yes-No means you have to give something to get something.  You have to give money to get the gardner to mow your lawn.  You have to invite people to your party in order to get them to invite you to theirs.  You have to sacrifice something in order for them to sacrifice something.  You count the number of times she calls you to see if it is equal to or above the number of times you call her.  She'll only give you sex if you do XYZ.  You have to buy her dinner, take her on dates, etc. to make her happy.  You have to be together on every trip all the time, because you get nervous when she's not with you, don't trust her love for you, are co-dependent


**Building a Yes-Yes relationship**:

If you got seriously injured, she would.  What about your friends?  What about your girlfriend?  Wife?  People who are in Yes-No marriages are the ones who end up unhappy in the long-run and ditch the relationship when things aren't fine and dandy, they find someone better, or aren't willing to put up with it anymore.  He told me, that the more experienced a woman is, the better she is at knowing who is capable of being a yes-yes guy.  Less experienced younger women need to be shown this in a more gradual way, because they haven't been frustrated enough yet by all the yes-no guys out there.  

What you have to do is work on yourself, it will happen, and you have to be okay with things not working out.  Love keeps on growing in a yes-yes relationship, but maintaining this let-go attitude gets even harder as the years go by.  He said that maintaining this attitude is the hardest thing he's ever had to do and it gets even harder as every year passes by.

Here are a list of things he's said to me in a somewhat random order regarding working on yourself:
Be aware of your emotions, determine if you did something to cause it, and apologize/make up for it if you're at fault.  If the person is just being a bitch, don't react and add fuel to the fire.  Stay calm, and let the negativity wear itself out.  It takes two people to fight.  Know what you want in life and don't allow anyone to stop you from getting it.  Enjoy the ride to getting it, otherwise you'll waste your life.

**Final Words**:

All relationships start out as yes-no.  A woman won't trust you yet the way she trusts her parents until a long time.  She WILL try to see if she can get stuff out of you and see if you are a yes-no guy.  This is part of being a woman, or just a boy.  If you show her that you are willing to be spineless to her wishes, react emotionally when something comes up, etc., she will keep pushing you towards the yes-no relationship.  Some women are perfectly happy being in a yes-no relationship, where they act like a bitch calling all the shots, and the guy is a puppy dog.  This happens the other way as well, however, they're a rare breed.  Women want to settle with men

I apologize in advance for the FR being so lengthy but I wanted to provide as much of the details that were important and led to the F-Close.

Over last week and a half or so I had 3 lays, the other girl during a hang out with some friends but I had met her once or twice before (altho never tried anything with her) and my ex. I didn't give myself any credit for my ex of course (she had reached out to me, but coming into this weekend I had a strong level of confidence that helped ""put me in state.""

I'll skip the first F-close from Friday and just get to Saturday to avoid writing too much. I walked outside the bar to grab a smoke and I saw a cute girl and smiled and said ""hey how are you?"". She was friendly and smiled back like any normal person would but I proceeded to fuck with her for a bit and said casually ""it's been a while

""Sorry

""Haha, what's new with you?""

""Wait

""Common

A couple of more back and forth until she seemed really mind fucked and I told her I was joking. She hit me and screamed ""YOU LITTLE SHIT!"" I was gold. She said that she's usually not that gullible and she's smart so I played with her the 5 lies game

I took her to the bar to get me my beer and applied kino immediately. She seemed competitive so I challenged her at thumb war, at least not that early on. 

Fast forward a couple of hours and this bar is closing soon. She's not from this neighborhood and her friends are from out of town so they entrust me and my friend (also my roommate) to show them somewhere they could still dance and grab a drink. It was almost 4am so places were closing. We suggested our patio but some of the group had resistance so that failed. My friend had to leave to take care of something so I had to juggle a bit too much. I took them to this bar but the music stopped and they stopped serving. 5 minutes later and I round up the troops and tell them it's getting late.

My target wanted to go to the subway. The train was close to my place and her friends were going in a separate direction. I desperately needed this isolation and since my friend had to leave me to shepherd this herd solo, the weather is wonderful' and we headed into my building. 

On the patio I was trying to take kino to the next level but she had a strong guard up. I did the photo booth thing on my laptop where we take a series of consecutive flicks, 1 pretending to make out and one normal. It brought down her guard a little bit but not the way I wanted. She kept saying how she has to leave after this beer. I play the cube on her, helps a bit. We're talking about all sorts of things while outside but I didn't want to keep my mind of the prize. I try this one exercise, cannot recall where I derived this from. It can be a little awkward, especially when completely sober, but it helps. I tell her you're still a little shy so I want to bring us a bit closer. The exercise, and I tell her it's going to be slightly awkward but it's worth it if we can get through it

""Cover your left eye and I'll cover mine. Stare with your right eye into mine. We need to do this for 30 seconds. This is not a starting competition so you can blink

I tell her it's getting a bit chilly, in certain cases, such as this when the girl doesn't seem so comfortable with the idea of coming home with you in the first place on the the first time you meet them, making yourself seem like you're not trying to rush things to your bedroom prevents them from putting up higher walls and builds a level of trust. In my room I try to kiss her but she doesn't let me make out with her right away so I kept talking to her for a bit. Lot's of chemistry. It's 5AM and I tell her it's way too late right now. ""You're in luck. I'm out of condoms so I can't sleep with you, and I'm going to let you sleep here because it's way too late to take the subway."" Again, that helped make her feel comfortable. She didn't say no, didn't say yes, wow I like how you've made the decisions for me

I come back and go to bed. She was really tired so typical LMR wouldn't have been effective here because she would've just fallen asleep, but you need to remove your shirt unless you want to get my lotion on it."" Again, keeping it subtle. As I gave her a quick massage, I licked her ear and kissed her neck. She got really turned on and we finally started making out. I started fingering her after a while and it got heavy. SHE asked me, does your roommate have any condoms? It went down. Complete side note, the best thing was that I liked this girl and had a great time with her and we talked for hours after sex.

Hey everybody. Happy to be back on Seddit doing another AMA. I really enjoyed my last one. 

Quick blurb about me: 

I'm a PUA veteran. I found the community in 2005 and got success pretty quickly. I began coaching guys locally in 2007 and in 2008 began my business which was known as ""Practical Pick Up"". Last year I retired from coaching and expanded my business into [Postmasculine.com](http://postmasculine.com)

When it comes to dating and pick up advice

- Seduction is an emotional process

- I like to say if you can walk and you can talk then you can pick up a hot girl. There's no skill to it. 

- Don't believe me, our shame, our insecurities, our poor self image, this stuff all comes roaring out of us. The skill is sorting through this emotional garbage to free yourself up to act openly and confidently no matter who you're with. 

- Attraction is not about what you say or do, you will kill any attraction. You could say the dumbest thing in the world, but if you're a cool guy, it won't matter, in fact it will likely make her like you even more. 

- You become an attractive individual by investing in yourself rather than in the women you are pursuing. Sex and women is a side effect of becoming an emotionally competent and sexually confident man

- Honesty is the best policy. As is making yourself vulnerable to rejection and judgment. As is connecting with women on an emotional level. Stop acting like a social robot and create some goddamn romance!

- In my opinion, self esteem, social anxiety, conquering phobias, sexual insecurity, dating and attraction, and PUA is sorely unaware of a large amount of it. 

- Although I still write a lot about dating, life purpose, entrepreneurship, happiness, etc. 

But since this is Seddit

This made everything awkward and I didn’t try to escalate. 30 minutes after getting there she told me I should leave. Once I did

* 3/27/12 – Tuesday 

-7 day/street approaches.

-2 phone numbers.

-Went for drinks with a girl from 3/26. Made out heavily with her and a lot of petting. Made sure to sit next to her right from the get go. This made things ridiculously easy. Couldn’t pull because she was 20

-2 subway approaches.

-2 subway phone numbers! – The first one I got on the way to the date. The girl was cute and I wanted to get a phone number to pump my state. The second one was with a girl after my date. I was frustrated that I couldn’t pull so I tried to instadate with a girl in the subway. The best I could do was a phone number.


* 3/28/12 – Wednesday 

-6 day/street approaches. Did the approaches by myself

-1 phone number


* 3/29/12 – Thursday 

-8 day/street approaches by myself. Did them fast again.

-4 night/bar/street approaches.

-Made out heavily with a cougar. Got her number and went to a different place. Started talking to a cuter girl at the new place and the cougar texted me and invited me to come join her at her apartment. Turned down the offer so I could continue talking with the cuter girl. Big mistake.


* 3/30/12 – Friday 

-6 night/street approaches.

-3 phone numbers

-2 night/bar approaches.

* 3/31/12 – Saturday

-2 phone numbers.

-Then the girl from 3/27 came to visit me. As I was kissing her again

-4 apocalypse openers. The first one went extraordinarily well and I was close to pulling it off. With a little bit of practice

-1 subway approach with a legit 9.5 and one of the hottest girls I’ve ever seen. It was 3 AM. I was on the subway coming home. The subway was relatively crowded for the late hour. Even after all the approaches, and I did. I may have not gotten her phone number, but I felt proud for being able to use my month of training to overcome this approach anxiety. And my newfound ability to deal with rejection made the blow out feel like a nice end to a conversation rather than a legit blow out.


***Condensed stats:***

**-221+ approaches.**

**-34 phone numbers.**

**-4 legit pull opportunities.**


I would encourage everybody to do this. At first it was very difficult and I struggled to do just 15 days straight. There were times where I really hated sarging

I’m feeling increasingly like a man of value

1375455582.0,1jkf7z,Tips for Introverts,WarehouseJim,340,72,68,"I see a lot of people posting about introversion and I wanted to give a few pointers on what I've learned since diagnosing myself as an introvert. 

**Background**

Some signs you might be an introvert:

* Long social events can be exhausting

* You need quiet time to recharge

* You don't like small talk and prefer more meaningful conversations. People might criticize you for being too serious.

Some misconceptions about introverts:

* Introverts have poor social skills

* All introverts are shy

Obviously, I highly recommend [Quiet](http://books.google.com/books/about/Quiet.html?id=uyjf3uaQ4TwC) by Susan Cain. This book helped me realize what my strengths were and allowed me to be confident expressing myself for who I am. Like I said, introverts get a bad rep and I hear people mention it on reddit like it's some sort of condition. America is a majority extroverted culture, but many Asian cultures are majority introverted. It's just a different way of interacting.

**Tips**

* Get out early! If you're going to bars on a Friday or Saturday

* Make your approaches count. This can be applied to introverts or extroverts, I'll be too drained to approach anyone else.

* Learn how to fake extroversion. This doesn't mean faking who you are, but you need to do it until she's comfortable taking the conversation a little deeper.

* Find a chatty friend. Obviously

* Be aware of the noise level. I have decent club game because I love to dance but I'd never try having an extended conversation because my voice is pretty quiet. I rely almost entirely on body language. I avoid bars that play loud music because if I'm at a bar, stay away from the speakers. *Quiet* mentions that introverts tend to have softer voices. 

Hope this was helpful!

The bus was crowded. I was in the middle of the bus and since she just got on

All that went through my mind was: ""How can I meet her? How can I walk up to the front this bus?"" I didn't feel panicy. I felt calm

I saw an opening

I turned around.
""Excuse me
She lookeda t me and looked away. I didnt give up. ""Excuse me"" I said again.  She pulled out her earbud.

""I don't do this alot but I saw you walking to the bus and I thought you were really cute. So

She smiled. Her teeth showed. They were pearly white.

""Hi

We shake hands

The girl laughed. She had this cute lip ring on the top of her lip. We talked about work

The lady in front of us leaves. I tell her ""So is this the part where I am chivalrous and let you have the seat?""

She smiles more

 And then

In my head I was doing backflips. But I was trembling. A girl hasn't made me nervous feeling in forever. 

My stop was coming up and I mistimed the whole idea that I could get her number. We hugged and I got off. She said she will text me. I didn't get her number.

I was excstatic. No girl has asked for my number first. EVER. Holy fuck. This feeling is sensational.

I didn't kiss a girl till 20. Because I was scared. Had a few opportunities (not too many) before then

Why was I scared? I THOUGHT WAY TOO MUCH ABOUT IT.

This is the problem if you have anxiety about never having kissed a girl. You think about it. And then you think about those thoughts you've thought about. And then you think about those thoughts about the thoughts you've thought about.

You continue thinking about it until you have anxiety stemming from every single angle.

Will my breath smell?
Do I open my mouth?
Will I miss her lips?
Will her breath smell?
Will she hate me?
Do I apply chapstick 10 minutes before?
What if my mouth is dry?
What do I do with my hands?

I can't even remember half the anxiety I had about kissing.

And do you want to know why?

BECAUSE NONE OF IT FUCKING MATTERED!!!!!!

Kissing is NATURAL. You already know what to do. Even if you don't think you do

That doesn't mean you'll have a perfect kiss... it could suck. But get this: the quality of the kiss—in most cases—has much more to do with the chemistry between you two than your actual ""technical abilities"".

Don't worry about technique... not in kissing or sex (but be aware of the female anatomy). It's about chemistry

Breath: it matters

To illustrate this: before I kissed girls

If you have good hygiene (brush your teeth 2x a day, you will have zero problems in this area.

I was always worried I'd miss her lips. Nope

Fit the lips like puzzle pieces... one on top of the other. They lock perfectly like this. 

Kissing is natural. It's easy. If you have a bad kiss

Lastly..........

KISSING IS FUN.

So there.

OH FUCK EDIT: Jesus, but it happens on an individual timeline, separate from societies agenda for you.

You feel shitty because society has told you to feel shitty. That's literally the only reason. You can opt out.

Oh

Want to know how you can get over your fear and push your life forward? Decide to do it. That's all it takes. Make a decision and fully commit to do it. I set myself a goal the year I got my first kiss and lost my virginity. And the goal was to do just that. I fully committed... if I had to

But you need to make a decision and fully commit to it. This is how you make things happen in your life. Spending time being anxious about things is doing you no good. Anxiety is ok

UH

Think of kissing and sex like jazz. It's not only on your end, evolves... don't worry about technique, focus on the moment and what she's doing, AND LISTEN TO THE MOOD. As you kiss, you'll feel like doing one thing or another. DO IT, IN THAT MOMENT. You're providing her with material to go off of. It's a dance, and it takes two to tango!",False,,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/19r8nk/if_youve_never_kissed_a_girl_read_this/

I guess I posted this because I hope you might have some questions that could be answered from the perspective of someone who doesn't ""seduce"" but gets a lot of sex. Just a different point of view to freshen things up...

A little about my sex life. I've had about three real male friends my whole life that I love and respect. I consider all other males in my life either family or simply passing acquaintances who I spend only necessary amounts of time with (coworkers, I see that at this moment there are at least four (maybe five) girls that, once I set myself to it, I could be in bed with in the next 24 to 48 hours. I have sex as much as I want, and sometimes a bit more. I can't remember the last time I jerked off. I've turned down sex on several (not many) occasions. I might have a threesome or two every semester or so.

That's pretty much been a steady situation for me for the past ten years or so

Picking up women at a bar that I don't know is a completely foreign concept to me. I rarely go to bars or clubs. I dislike them very much

I feel like my success with women comes from the following:


1) I only make friends with attractive, jealous, air-headed, argumentative, stuck-up bitches get absolutely no attention from me whatsoever. (Guess which type you are more likely to find at a bar/night club as opposed to, say, volunteering at the local food bank) Yes

2) I'm good at telling when women are interested in me or not. If they're not, I put them on the spot with physical affection. Usually, I'll either just hold their hand or maybe kiss them on the neck a few times when they hug me. If it wasn't clear before, this always makes it so one way or another. Again, If there is no attraction, I move on as if nothing happened and just let it be a friendship.

3) I'm not a porn star in bed

4) Sex is never the reason why we're friends or the reason I ask to hang out. Ever. Sex is an added bonus. It something that just happens. We go out. We go swimming. We play tennis. We go to happy hour to have a few drinks together. We have dinner. We catch up on how our week went. Sex is not the point of my life. Its a thing I do because I'm a human being. Like eating or sleeping.

5) This is probably the most important one. No jealousy, possessiveness, checking-up on, clingyness... I don't know what else to list here. What happens in the bedroom, happens in the bedroom. Outside of that, I respect these people and keep a healthy distance. I never talk about what we do to anyone. I rarely bring it up verbally when we're not doing it, even to them (there are exceptions with a few of them on this point). I can't count the number of guys who come in and out of their lives (again

**What AFCs think is romantic: drama**

Love songs

The AFC is mopy, and emo. He thinks she is the one. He needs her for validation, and will sacrifice everything for her.

Maybe the AFC is a soldier

It involves: 1) intense and very genuine need; 2) need not being met.

This sells. Why? It creates tension and release. It's a form of story-telling. It is clear that the hero has good qualities that haven't surfaced, and losers in life identify with it.

**The problem**

This isn't how the real world works. Imagine a job interview. Is the underdog the guy who gets hired? No

The football team captain gets the girl. The douchebag gets the girl. The fun guy who's having a hilarious and jolly time gets the girl. The guy who's adding value and getting shit done (because he's in a good mood and not moping) gets the girl.

The upstanding ""emo"" self-victimized guy gets dumped. ""Sorry, because you're weak and lame.""

When it's done in the movies, if he's just a loser.

**Truth: Women don't think romantically**

Imagine yourself in the wild, and a man had to be decisive, or be killed.

Women don't have time for emo neediness. They avoid needy guys; they've experienced needy guys hitting on them, because they know it's unattractive. Women are practical-minded and abundance-seeking; rarely do they wallow and mope. They are highly emotionally resilient. Sorry, they DO NOT share your feelings of intense longing and sadness.

Unfortunately

They don't understand that a woman's biggest turn-on is strength

**The Opposite**

Relaxed, commanding, abundant, laughing, self-amusing, engaged, open.

Your state is good, blow-outs, amogs, and shit-tests.

In every happy marriage I've seen in real life

**A Good Hack**

Act like a big happy baby

Remember when your mom was away when you were a kid

Remember when your mom was right there and you were happily busy playing? Be that.

Why spend your time being sad and dramatic and emo

We wondered why there are so few 2-sets at bars and clubs nowadays

So girls go out in big groups to ""party"", and get some good sex for the night. Why go home with a random creeper and look like a slut in front of all your friends when you've got dick on tap 24/7 via your smartphone?

This is even more true for smartphone-addicted college girls with vast social circles. And this is also why tourists

All this leads to far fewer guys pulling from a pure cold approach today than in 2002. Not because guys today have shitty game, giving girls constant attention, validation and access to an infinite supply of dick.

I went through a 4 week acute severe depression. I even considered killing myself. One wonderful day, I broke completely free of the depression, and now I'm back. Stronger than ever before and more motivated than ever before. My mindset right now is absolutely indescribable. I learned to love myself, love everything I've achieved and everything I can achieve. I am proud of myself and especially of the fact that I was stuck in hell and managed to break free.

And now to you.

You're fucking awesome.

If you have any, even the slightest doubts about this statement, you've got a serious problem and you need to take care of it right now.

I want you to think about why you don't think you're the single most awesome, most sexy person on earth. 

Are you fat? Are you shy? Do you have three eyes?

ANYTHING that you're not satisfied with about yourself will affect your whole life. Don't believe me? Then why are you scared of escalating? Maybe because of that fat on your stomach?

It is INCREDIBLY FUCKING IMPORTANT that you like yourself and that you're 100%ly satisfied with every single aspect of your life. Routines and magic tricks don't mean SHIT if you're unhappy with yourself

Are you scared of approaching women? Then go out and fucking do something against it.
Are you fat? Go to the fucking gym and work out until you're completely satisfied with your appearance.

Trust me - If you don't have any success with women right now

Get your fucking life in order

I'm not perfect myself and there's a few things that are keeping me from being completely satisfied with myself

1339719861.0,v2lev,How to get good with women fast,TrippAdvice1,320,59,67,"There’s no special pill. 


There are no magic words.


But there’s something even better…


YOU. 


Okay


*“I’m scared”*

*“I’ll get rejected”*

*“What if people see me?”*

*“I’m not good enough”*


Let me say

**1) Talk to everyone, school, grocery store, etc. always look for an opening for conversation. Get your brain used to having conversations with strangers. In other words, be social. Embody what it ‘s like to be a talkative, interesting and social person. It doesn’t matter what you say or how you say it, just talk. You’d be surprised how many people will respond. Here are a few examples:

*“I couldn’t help but over hear you say xyz

*“The weather is so nice/bad today

*“I love (insert grocery/purchase item here)



**2) Flirt with every woman.** Okay, throw in a few flirts. Now you’re getting used to know what it’s like to be a flirty man. Show your intent! You’re going to need these skills when the time comes to flirt with the women you actually want. Compliments work great. Here are a few examples:

*“That (insert clothing item here) is really sexy”*

*“We’ve been talking for about 5 minutes now and I just noticed how beautiful your eyes are”*

*“You have the sexiest…little…elbows!”*



**3) Set a plan and be consistent.** Although this is #3 in the list, you’ll see.

If you want to get good at something fast, repeat, fail, repeat, and fail, until you succeed. Never give up. Even if it is the hardest thing to accomplish, DON’T GIVE UP. 

I heard a quote once that if you take one more step past the hardest point

**TL;DR** – repetition is the key to success

1376062103.0,1k13ih,[FR] - First time working a Mother/Daughter set. Went better than expected (x-post from GothamSeddit),jimmyayo,365,107,74,"Sup Seddit!  It's been a while since my last FR

**FIRST APPROACH**

It was a Tuesday noon

**""Excuse me

I immediately ask whether they're mother/daughter (yes), partying in Tijuana, kept the convo light but fun.  We talk about what we do for a living.  

Finally, the mother laughs and says ""Okay!""  

Right there *I bear-hug the mother and say ""muchas gracias!""* and she says ""ohmygod"".  We snap some pictures together (me w/ the HB8), so I had to act quick. 

That same afternoon

**THURSDAY DINNER DATE**

I know lots of people don't think dinner dates are great

As soon as we meet at the designated streets, and *immediately put my elbow out so she can hook her arm in*.  Boom.  Frame was set that she's my girl for the duration of this date. 

At the restaurant: while waiting for a table, I have a gin martini.  **She's sitting on a stool and I'm standing next to her**: this is a *GREAT position* when at the bar - it gives you complete freedom to kino tons, lean in (reward), lean away (display disinterest), etc.  If you're both sitting on stools, it can make it much more awkward to work your space.  During 30 min. at the bar, I had already done tons of kino escalation, talked to a guy on the opposite side of me

During dinner

She at one point tells me she was married for less than a year, put my *hand around her shoulder*, ask how she's been dealing w/ it.  She tells me he was a loser.  I tell her she can probably do much, much better, maybe even get lucky w/ a handsome New Yorker, laugh and put my hand on her thighs. 

***Important note**: At no point during the dinner date did I over-state my interest.  I moved in and out of displaying interest vs disinterest.  I let silence come over the conversation and was perfectly fine with it.  I was completely myself and just comfortable w/ being myself

This had the effect of making her wonder if she ""had"" me.  When we were settling up the bill, you're so sweet."" 

Right before we stand up to leave, and we make out again for about 10-15 sec. 

Things were going well

***But first...***

I had some food leftover from dinner that I got wrapped up to-go.  I said let's swing by my apt so I can put the food in the fridge

Right before we head in my building

I laugh and say: ""Yes I'm going to kidnap you and sell your body to the mafia.""  

She replies ""okay haha I'll just wait here outside"".  

Then I call her silly (or stupid, I'm just going to put the food in the fridge"".

We are upstairs now in my apt.  After I'm done using the restroom

Now I say **""okay

Then she says *""yes...but wait""*  she comes over to me, then the bed...

Like a true gentleman

Needless to say...we never made it to the jazz lounge  :)

**Key points:**

* Total lapsed time spent together
* Total $ spent: $70
* Total alcoholic beverages consumed: 1 each.
* I never let her have the feeling that she ""had"" me
* Power play 1: as soon as we met for the date
* Power play 2: after dinner
* Power play 3: upstairs at the apartment, but it played out well for me in this instance.

I'm here to say that it is bullshit.  I have seen why first hand and here is a real life example of 2 roommates I knew in college:

Roommate #1:  About 5'9"", un-athletic, not particularly attractive in any way, a bit of a double chin.  BUT, he was the most charasmatic person I have ever met in my entire life.  He had a golden tongue.  He could talk to anybody, was a confident mother fucker, and a great time to be around.  He had what I called ""irrational confidence.""  That is, without having money, read it again).

Roommate #2:  About 6'2"", pecs bigger than most girls, strong jaw line, chiseled features, attractive face.  BUT, this guy was dopey as shit.  He wasn't good at maintaining a conversation, didn't really have anything particularly interesting to say

Guess who got laid more?  I have never seen anybody get as much ass as the first guy.  He had numbers like you wouldn't believe.  You know who wasn't successful?  The second guy (unless he was nailing the first guy's leftovers).  He rarely could keep a girl's attention long enough to get with her.

Why?  Because roommate #1's personality was a tractor beam.  You couldn't be in the room with him without feeling his presence.  Guys looked up to him, funny, confident, interesting.  He had no fear.  I once saw him organize a naked party.  That's right, he convinced everyone to strip down, 1 article of clothing every 15 minutes.  How?   Because he was a leader, and people followed him.  

Never use your looks as an excuse.  It is bullshit and self defeating.  It is not what's holding you back

Somebody posted a link to a [body language book](http://westsidetoastmasters.com/resources/book_of_body_language/toc.html) yesterday. It was pretty big and therefore hard to manage, so here it is.

I've mostly kept them in order of appearance

-The attraction process typically has five steps:

--1. The woman makes eye contact for a few seconds

--2. The woman gives a quick smile

--3. The woman begins preening, or sitting up to emphasize her tits. She might also lick her lips or straighten her clothes. The man usually responds by expanding his chest, sucking in his gut, and straightening his clothes. Both are pointed toward each other.

--4. The man approaches her to talk

--5. The woman will initiate some light touch on the arm or hands; repeating the same touches shows that she's comfortable with how things are. Hand touches are more personal than arm touches. Brushing or touching the shoulder shows that she cares about his health or appearance.

-Women commonly use 13 gestures during courtship:

--1. The head toss and hair flick shows interest and that she cares about her appearance around you.

--2. If her lips are wet and pouting, and genitals when aroused, which is also why red lipstick became popular).

--3. If a woman slowly and sensually touches her neck, it means that if a man plays his cards, he could touch her in the same way. She's effectively imagining him touching her there.

--4. Allowing her wrist to go limp shows submission

--5. Fondling a cylindrical object lets you know what's on her mind.

--6. Women will expose their wrists more as interest grows

--7. A sideways glance over her shoulder lets her feel like she's peeping

--8. Rolling of the hips is something that only women can do

--9. The pelvic tilt makes her hips look bigger

--10. If a woman puts her handbag close to you

--11. If she tucks one leg under the other

--12. Dangling the shoe on the end of the foot shows relaxation while implying fucking via repetitive thrusting movements.

--13. Placing one leg over the other so that they're parallel signifies that she's ready to screw. Women will also cross and uncross their legs slowly

-People lean against things (or other people) to show ownership or a terroritorial cliam.

-As a general rule

-Less movement shows confidence

-The six secrets of attractive body language

--1. Have an animated face and a smile; be sure to flash your teeth.

--2. Be expressive with your gestures but don't overdo it. Keep your fingers crossed and below your chin

--3. Use triple nods when talking and a head tilt when listening. Keep your chin up.

--4. Give the amount of eye contact that makes everyone feel comfortable. Lean forward when listening

--5. Stand as close as you feel comfortable. If the other person moves back

--6. Subtly mirror the body language of others.",,t5_2qhrv,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/g94wr/book_of_body_language_summary/

I made my way to a houseparty the other night

I'm not one to judge a book by its cover, I wasn't about to try any kino, but I wasn't about to give her a reason to immediately reject me.

This is when I started the ""nice guy"" routine. I didn't treat her any differently than the friends she was with, and made our way into the living room. I isolated her and started asking really open-ended questions about her life - once again, she was really reserved. ""This isn't going to be easy,"" I thought, ""She won't even put her phone away."" 

We were standing in front of a couch, she did. I turned my whole body towards her, and said, ""Tell me your story."" Again, to my surprise, she started to open up. I asked her if she thought I was dangerous, to which she replied, I think you're pretty nice."" After a few open ended questions about her upbringing, and hobbies

I didn't want to leave the couch and come back to her gone, but complied.

I drained the main vein and returned to her holding my beer. I took it

Battles eating disorders, doesn't want to live long anyways, goes to raves consistently, has had sex with 7 guys, single, doesn't like to be touched, she's adopted, wants to fly a plane one day

Frankly

The atmosphere changed a little

I wasn't about to let her forget about me, casually texted her the next day (short and brief, no need to converse over text messages) and set up a coffee date.

In her texts

Me: It's a date.

Girl: I'm not as friendly sober. So don't be surprised

Me: You're not that friendly drunk either.. But I think I can manage. Thanks for the heads up.

Girl: You bet.

I have to say though

But for someone like me who over analysed EVERYTHING it just didn't work. There was always an excuse, girl with a guy, or just a girl looking pissed off. I had to think up my own method. 

So what I did was I spent the next 3 weeks of nights out not thinking about the game at all. I went out with the sole intention of simply telling the hottest girls in the bar/club all about ME. 
I never let them turn the conversation on to them and if they did I related it back to a story about me. 
What I noticed was this, but most of them will interest her.
If she tries to flirt with you do not give in! Laugh it off and continue the conversation.

To mask this I would ask her a question that would set me up for a story about myself. ""what's your most embarrassing moment?"". For example. Then I will go into an entertaining story about mine, hand gestures, my vocal language and eye contact. But what I won't do is forget that I'm out for the selfish purpose of telling these girls my life story. 

At the end of these 3 weeks I had an unbelievable amount of material that I knew was either interesting or funny. I knew that girls don't bite and Infact love a good storyteller. I knew that I could keep a HB9/10's attention for 30-60min with my entire life's worth of silly stories. But most importantly I knew that I'd just spoken to loads of beautiful girls and nothing bad happened. Infact on a few occasions I'd actually rejected their advances.

1343069751.0,x12io,10 Mistakes I Made in College,TrippAdvice1,312,53,87,"After I graduated college 5 years ago, so below is a list of the top 10 mistakes I made in college.


**1. Not Talking to Enough Girls**
I was in a fraternity and had options to talk to many girls. The only ones I talked to were the ones that I was introduced to. I never branched out and approached any girls on campus or in bars that I was interested in. I went to a college with over 40,000 were girls. I did not take advantage of that and I should have, EVERY SINGLE DAY. Instead I complained about not being able to meet new ones and didn’t taking any action.


**2. Going to the Same Bars**
My friends went to the same bars every single weekend. Of course, to realize I was missing out this entire time!


**3. Skipping Class**
I would skip class at least 1-2 times a week. Luckily


**4. Not Making More Friends in My Classes**
The classes that I did attend, interesting people and it’s important to take advantage of that.


**5. Getting a Girlfriend Too Quick**
Lucky for me it only lasted 3 months, it happens. But, my advice to you is not to go on a hunt for it. College is the time for experiencing multiple girls and making strong bonds with your friends. Don’t let anything take you away from that.


**6. Not Talking to Women I Was Attracted To**
There were so many hot girls that came around and I had easy opportunities to flirt with them or at least make friends with them. Instead


**7. Not Reading Enough**
There is a lot of downtime in college. Instead of picking up a good book I would party or sleep. There’s nothing wrong with either of those (especially in college) but it would have been good to pick up a new book every once in awhile. I don’t mean your course books either, I was too lazy.


**8. Not Wearing a Condom**
There were a number of times I did not wear a condom in college. This was a poor decision. I didn’t catch any STD’s or get a girl pregnant (luckily) but I easily could have. A lot of people make this mistake and for them


**9. Drinking Too Much**
There was never a night out that I didn’t drink. Of course, I slowed down my drinking to one drink a night (if that) when I went out and I got more numbers and more dates. If I applied that same mentality to my college nights, I would have been more successful with women and woke up feeling healthier in the morning.


**10. Creating Bad Eating Habits**
Every day I ate fast food or unnatural, it still affected my overall mood. Many days I would consistently feel like shit and I blamed it on my homework load or drunken nights out. In reality, my issue was the unhealthy food I was constantly putting in my body. A more natural and balanced diet helps you stay focused, energetic, and happy. It was hard to change these habits post college, but with enough time I managed to do so.


If you are in college or about to enter, because you can still have fun at the same time. Remember, everything is better for you in moderation. 

**tl;dr** - don't miss any opportunities in college

There's a killer move I have used for years, it makes perfect sense.  To all the nerdy guys out there who are terrified of approaching, but can have a decent conversation once the ice is broken: this is my gift to you.  Trust me, this is gold.  (But there is one condition - don't let this become a crutch.  Grab your balls and learn to approach as well.)

The move?  Read a book at the bar.  Seriously.  It's magic. This one move has gotten me more ass than a donkey farm over the years. 

It seems bizarre at first - no one was more surprised than I was when this got me laid over and over again

I started doing this with absolutely no concept of using it for pickup.  The simple truth is that, so why not combine the two?

Here's the thing, usually a woman, and often the hottest woman there.  (This works especially well with hot female bartenders - normally a very tough target).

If you don't find yourself in the situation, and if not, guy's girlfriends would always be hanging out, and their girlfriends would start hanging out there too. 


First of all, make jokes, and generally be yourself without much pressure. After a while, you start talking to them like you talk to your guy friends (maybe a little more censored), and you drop this dividing wall between talking with each gender. It becomes just ""making conversation"" instead of ""talking to a girl"". The biggest thing I noticed was that I always told goofy jokes around my guy friends, but never showed that side of myself to girls upon first meeting them, because I assumed it would be weird or something, and if you bomb a joke


Seriously though about the joke part, which boosted my confidence to make more comments and jokes like that, and the confidence just built upon itself to where I'll drop a weird funny comment to a girl right when I meet her, and my body language and smile convey confidence to where they are already giggling before I make a punchline. Even if the joke bombs, I'll comment on it with the same confidence and *that* will get them laughing.


Secondly, usually drunken, and nothing dramatic ever came of it), but girls have circles of their girlfriends, and they invite them over just like guys invite their buddies to come hang out and watch TV on the couch. Not only do these girls come to all of your parties, but more importantly, they come over just in the middle of a Tuesday and you're instantly introduced. The girls know you're not a creep (you're not a creep right?) because you live with their friend and girls talk... So you've already got a head start when it comes to them being receptive. And so what if you don't find them attractive? Chat them up anyways, and you'll be seeing them around a lot.


Third, and trust me, the other girls in the bar take immediate notice. You already know all these girls so you'll be playing pool together and cracking corny jokes, which makes you approachable.


Pitfalls:


Taking sides on girls arguments. It totally happens


Sleeping with the roommates or their friends, usually at every single party in the future. We still proceeded with caution, met a lot of great girls (couple girlfriends between all of us, mostly hookups at parties). I finally learned (took me 20 years) that honesty is a get-out-jail-free card in 95% of situations with girls (guys too).

You go out on a date with a girl. The next day,"" or ""I'm getting a friendship vibe from you."" She *explicitly* told you how she feels. Implicit communication would be if she simply didn’t text you back at all. She is communicating to you that she’s not interested but she’s not explicitly telling you she isn’t interested. Explicit communicate is typically verbal and straightforward where as with implicit communication she's sending a message based on action rather than the surface meaning of the words.

When I wasn’t so skilled socially

**The Key to Staying Empowered in Relationships**

Once you start to get into relationships, or some other issue comes up and the first word of advice is always: Have a talk about it. This is explicit communication. 

If there is a sitcom-style misunderstanding in the relationship

Let’s say you’re dating a girl. You're unhappy because she's flirting with other guys while out on dates with you. If you chose the route of explicit communication

The problem here is that as you are explicitly communicating with her about what you like and don’t like

Alternatively, as a signal to her that her actions are inappropriate. 

Implicit communication tends to be more powerful than explicit communication because you're *taking action*. You’re showing her that you will walk away if her bad behavior continues. She sees that she’s losing you and has to make a change if she is going to continue to be with you.

**Implicit Communication is the Most Honest**

While implicit communication seems complicated, that you’re valuable in the relationship and if she wants more, she needs to act appropriately.

Once you learn the difference between implicit and explicit communication

A girl at a bar walks by and says to you

Likewise, she's saying Yes. She's friendly and positive. But implicitly, she's saying No because she won't hang out with you. Until she acts otherwise, you need to proceed like it's a No or else you will invest too much time and energy into a lost cause. Watch her actions, not her words.

Last night was a fairly typical night for me. I texted around to my different social circles and had a few party options. I picked the one that sounded most promising and headed over around 10 o clock after a glass of scotch (This is the only alcohol I allow myself

At this time I spotted one of the girls I had invited. Previously I had friendzoned her and turned her into a great resource. Not only does she socially proof me (because she's hot) but she wings me in set occasionally. She tells me she brought a friend of hers

I opened with the GREATEST OPENER EVER. **""Hey who are you""** it never fails! I steered the conversation in a couple of different directions, and then point to a dude at the party and be like ""oh man I fucking hate that guy"". My emotions were constantly changing and this way the conversation was never boring. 

After some pretty heavy kino and about 20 minutes of conversation I was beginning to get a bored. I could have kissed this girl 10 minutes earlier but building up the anticipation is a great tactic to ensure that a girl stays interested in you. I tell her exactly how I feel **""I'm getting a bit bored so i'm going to go talk to my friends

I've really found this line to be a complete mindfuck for girls. Most AFCs when they make out with a girl will stick to her for the entire night

This time she orbited around me as I ignored her for a while and then was like ""HEY HB8!!!!!!"" hows it going. She literally didn't even respond to me

After I had sex with her

Lessons:

1. Be completely and utterly secure in yourself. Be honest

2. Make moves, put your arm around her after a little while, then after a while of conversation tell her that you're going to kiss her. Obviously there's some steps in-between but that's really the essence of a standard pickup for me. 

3. You don't always have to do crazy wild stupid shit to amaze a girl. Most of my success nowadays happens exactly like it did above. Be kind of chilled out

1297062212.0,fgq0a,Approach Anxiety is a symptom of EXTREME selfishness and douchebaggery (KINDA LONG),,333,80,68,"I suffered from extreme AA the entire first year I was sarging

Right now, and I'll come off as awkward and the conversation would die off in 20 seconds and it's safer to just not approach"". Even if you don't actually think this to yourself every time, this type of basic attitude is the source of AA. So listen up:

Hot girls do get hit on all the time. 99/100, making boring conversation, and not adding any excitement or value to her life at all. This is where shit tests and bitch shields come from (I know, I know, this is hardly groundbreaking stuff- hear me out).

SO. First off it's important to understand that WOMEN DO NOT MIND PEOPLE TALKING TO THEM. Seriously, YOU'RE NORMAL, CONGRATULATIONS. That's the WORST case scenario! Wrap your head around this concept, care for it, feed it, nurture it, ponder it and all of it's implications. You can do NO worse than normal. It's like someone giving you a test and saying, the absolute lowest score possible is a C. You literally cannot

Second, unchivalrous douchebag because you are placing your own fears and wants above her needs. Women NEED you to improve their lives. They are DESPERATE for something exciting to happen. They silently BEG you every day to start a conversation and drop an atomic love bomb into their world. I'm not even kidding, ask ANY girl you know. Better yet, ask every girl you DON'T know. If you're trying to kick AA, go up to a hot chick tomorrow and just ask her, ""So when I see a cute girl out and about, I should absolutely go talk to her right? Girls all silently hope for a fun guy to spontaneously start talking to them, I will PayPal that individual $100 dollars

Alright, but for now, just remember:

1. Normal guys are boring and slightly awkward when talking to hot chicks
2. Even if you are totally boring and awkward
3. If you open girls and are even slightly interesting and fun
4. NOT opening a girl means you are a selfish dick who wants to retain all the awesomeness in your life for just yourself.
5. All women want to be opened. 
6. For the love of GOD go outside and talk to girls.

1360797935.0,18h65c,[FR] report from the other side- girl meeting a PUA,gamegirluk,313,61,115,"Hi seddit

Situation: I was on a night out with my friends, lets call him Tom.

The opener: so, looks me up and down, and says 'so you came as a caterpillar, huh? that's awesome, I love caterpillars, I used to keep them in jars when I was a kid.' I was dressed as a leopard, so he was obviously messing with me...but for some reason I felt the need to defend myself and say 'I'm a leopard!' This is really different from the standard way guys approach me- I guess I usually have my 'bitch shield' up to stop random people but he was very confident and made me and Tom laugh and I felt like I needed to qualify myself to him. He also spent time talking to Tom and asking him questions which again was not normal. 

In my head I was thinking 'hmm if he was a PUA this would be really great stuff, negging her, etc.' Then he said he would bet me that I couldn't lie five times- he would ask me five questions, and I'd have to lie to all of them. If I lost, I'd buy him a shot- if I won, he'd buy the shots. At this point it was confirmed for me that he was in fact 'gaming' me and I was too flustered by this to agree to the bet because all I could think of was how he would react if I asked him about it, so he asked Tom instead. Tom lost and went to the bar to get the shots. Gameboy hooked his arm through mine and said 'come on

I can't remember exactly how I phrased it but I said something like, it's so interesting. Have you read it? That's crazy, I didn't think anyone would ever call me out on it.' So I told him that I hadn't actually read that book but I read a lot on the reddit seduction community and I'm interested in it. I was kind of relieved that he hadn't reacted badly, or made it awkward, and he was expressing interest in how I knew about this stuff, and made it seem like we had something to talk about, so we went to sit down after the shots. I asked if reading the book had changed a lot in his life and he said that it'd made a difference for him at work, also dressed as a monkey, introduced himself

At the end of the night I had to go with my friends and he said 'well this can end two ways, and we don't see each other again.' So very willingly I gave him my number, and he did call, and we are going out this Friday.

[FR] Me (M/21) at friend's house getting ready for a gig (I'm a musician), we played first, killed it.  Get two free drink tickets for playing there, saving that shit.  See my friend that called, go to say hi.  She points out a girl HB10 with a purse she likes, but I look to her right, holy shit, so I'm totally in state.  Sit next to her, bro'd with the guy right in front of her.  Turn to her

* Me: Hi.
* Her: Hey
* Me: Thanks
* Her: So
* Me: Oh

Totally confident, but...

* Her: I have a boyfriend.
* Me: Is it a girl of equal or greater attractiveness?
* Her: (laughing pretty hard) No, you would have been **so** in.

That took me by surprise.  She says that nobody has ever had the balls to approach her like that.  I ask what she meant by ""in"".  She says she probably would have ended up going home with me that night.

* Note: NOT a typical reaction.  I usually get a good reaction from that opener

Boyfriend comes, when she says she wants me to meet a friend of hers.  She turns around, it's the HB10 that my friend pointed out earlier.  Sweet.  We all start talking as a group I proceed to kino, she responds really quickly with overt kino on ME.  Keep that going about 5 more minutes to build some tension.  I nudge the dude while the girls are whispering something, ask him to help me isolate her.  He's got an idea.  He whispers something in his girl's ear, she starts giggling and suddenly says she needs some air.  Those two leave, My target watches them go

* Her: So how are you feeling right now?
* Me: Well

Lean in quickly for kiss, guy and girl come back.  They ask what we were doing, and I tell them, which makes my girl blush.  They say they want to leave, my girl says give us 20 minutes.  She takes me to a secluded table, we make out, I touch her, we get nasty.  20 minutes is done and we're both out of breath and sweating.  I tell her to order me a beer, drinks her shot that she ordered

Sweet.

I'm a first-year in university, a friend of mine went up to talk to her, and I figured this was the best chance I'd get to introduce myself. I went over and said hi, asked how she knew my friend, and it turns out she lives in the same building as us (our university halls are huge). They were about to head home and I decided to tag along. 

The walk isn't too long, smiling and giving me good vibes in general. By the time we got near our halls, my friend had left so it was just the two of us. I could tell this girl was into me, and from a past experience I wasn't about to fuck this up. Usually I would have just said bye, and waited for another chance like this to move forward, but I'd discovered seddit the week prior, and decided to do something about it. We were at the door of her building, you know that?"". She seemed like a shy girl so I didn't think she got compliments like that often, I gave her a hug and we parted ways.

Cue the next day, so it was mainly just asking questions back and forth, but I think because I was kino-ing her throughout and the fact that we were into each other canceled out the awkwardness that you would usually get from such a line of conversation. I noticed that she also started kino-ing me, and got me to touch her by saying stuff like ""My hair is so messy today, seriously try touching it"". It was really easy to get physical cause of little stuff like this. 

We get to the park, so I went in with that frame of mind for my questions. We already knew quite a bit about each other but nothing about our romantic lives so I asked her how much she'd done with guys in the past, and she said nothing major. I gave her a little shit for it and asked how that was even possible. She brushed it off and didn't really say anything, but it was cute anyway. It got to the point where she asked me how many girlfriends I'd had. I told her 0, but I'd still done stuff with girls before. She asks ""like what?"", and I tell her to close her eyes if she really wants to find out. She complies and I go in and we start making out. She was surprisingly good and we literally sat there making out for like 20 minutes. I did that thing I read on here where you tug on the back of her scalp and kiss her neck, which she reeeally seemed to dig. 

I tell her I wanna go back to her room, walk home and go to her room. The rest is pretty much history. There's not much else to say really in terms of seduction, I think the fact we were both virgins at 19 and had gotten on together really well was the crux of it. I was insanely horny by the time I got back to her room and so was she. I'm just surprised at how easy it was, and how much I would have missed out on this if it wasn't for reading some of the basic stuff I found on here. Cheers seddit :).",,False,,1342280621.0,t3_wjura
1328024169.0,p4mkr,"I found seddit 18 months ago. I've learnt a lot since then. Here are some hopefully unique thoughts, warnings and tips for intermediate users.",Fred_Flintstone,309,57,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/p4mkr/i_found_seddit_18_months_ago_ive_learnt_a_lot/

I've been here for 18+ months. 1 month in I had transformed my behaviour around women for the better, KINO EYES SMILE. 2-3 months in I had it near perfected, and knew what I should be doing most of the time. My behaviour overall since then isn't too different to how it was at that point. Yet I have made so many mistakes and learnt from them - the subtleties of what I do in each situation have adapted. I know certain things I should not say, and catch certain subtle long-term tests/games that I would have fallen for 16 months ago. BUT my overall behaviour is still the same, and when something goes wrong I still feel like that guy from 16 months ago. I'm not though - the number of mistakes I've learnt not to make has increased from 10 to about 2000.

*We can never be perfect at this.*

Please dont just skim that last line! For 18 months I've thought we could reach that plateu where all situations have an answer. If you see somebody reach perfection in the field then all it means is that they have reached a mastery in that niche environment. They are like a bee who found a massive flower and is making tonnes of sweet honey from it. Good on them. It is a skill to be able to have a high success rate of picking up bitchy but hot girls in up-town bars. It is also impressive to hit on intelligent women and make them feel smarter. **But don't rely on any one thing all the time**. The bee may one day get bored of that flower

Many of you may be here for self-improvement more than for getting sex. I know I was/am. Make sure you challenge yourself with new environments, and tell them that they are providing value for you in that way (they will appreciate and respect you for it). **Dating girls you know you do not wish to marry** (or even have a medium term relationship) is one of the best things you can do for your social intelligence and learning, and yet so few men bother (""nice guys"" are the worst for this).

If you are young (hell

**A warning**: As I've ""improved"" I have become less interested in women as a whole. A one night stand with an 'HB9' was something I would dream about from age 12 until a year ago. I no longer get much from it (except if I have not had sex in multiple weeks

The phrase ""Not giving a fuck"" gets thrown around a lot here. Often somebody would say they stopped caring and approached a girl. Thats great

On a night out and already confident / good at this stuff? Getting slapped doesn't hurt. The last few one night stands I've had slapped me before sleeping with me. Its a non verbal shittest used only by the slightly more bitchy HB8+s (they also have higher probability of DTF). If you pass it then you break many future barriers and show a lot of confidence and dominance, apologise, give her space, leave. If she is a little angry then you are likely doing it right.

**Another warning**: Caring less about what others think (about you) has its costs as well as its benefits. Suddenly I have to put mental effort into making sure some friends are not offended (e.g. I non-flirtingly tell their girlfriend she looks pretty today), the limited energy I have in a day is expended on things that I know will not ever shell out rewards of equal weight. I have discovered why the alpha male stereotype is often depicted as lonely - though sometimes it is a character flaw and he hates himself or cant express some things, he may also just have given up on expending the time and energy of helping everyone else without expecting anything in return. But continuing to help out those that rely on you is what makes you a better person, and isn't that why you searched for and found seddit in the first place?

I have lots more to say

1325013872.0,nskft,"[FR] Date + lay, learned about what makes a good date",leftajar,382,134,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/nskft/fr_date_lay_learned_about_what_makes_a_good_date/

I learned a TON from this

I haven't been on many dates. I'm more of a same-night lay sort of guy. To be honest

This one went well. Here's what I did to make it happen: I had a general plan of how it would go that wasn't too specific. I met her near where she lives -- this is crucial

**First lesson: Have a plan

After starbucks, it would've been weird.

**Second lesson: Take responsibility for moving the date forward

I had good instincts both times. I moved us out of starbucks at a good time. And moved us out of the bar at a good time. By good time, feeling good, and right as the conversation hit a natural transition point, I suggested we go. I didn't wait until the venue became boring. And I didn't wait for her to do it.

**Third lesson: Start touching early

I gave her a hug the second we met up. Throughout Starbucks and the bar, I was careful to be respectful as we were in public. The most I did was ""romantic"" touching, like touching her lower back or holding hands. I waited until we were alone to ramp it up.

She didn't kino me back very much. For every five I did, we have to lead.

**Third-and-a-half lesson: Be comfortable and keep the conversation going.**

Some girls are chatty, tell a fun story. Wait a second for her to chime in. If she doesn't, ask her a fun question. That's it! You can use silence to test her -- does she take some responsibility for the conversation by reinitiating? My girl did... and I took this as a sign of interest.

**Fourth lesson: Watch a movie. ""Let's watch a movie"" is the ""let's go fuck"" of our time. Use it!**

Women are horny! If you've been having fun, and giving her some sexual looks, she'll probably want you. Ask to isolate. There's a good chance she'll say yes. ""Watching a movie"" is awesome because it gives her an innocent excuse to be alone with you. It's not Don frickin Juan but it works.

**Fifth lesson: pick a movie that you both have seen and is light and funny. That way it's okay to talk over it.**

**Sixth lesson: once you're alone

Again, chat, laugh, and when you want to, just kiss her. It's so simple: pick a moment when you're both laughing and looking at each other, then go in for it.

**Seventh lesson: get sexual.**

When I was younger

There are ways to make kissing sexual, grab a fistful of hair near the roots, rub your hand up and down her side, etc. Don't delay on this stuff. A natural and fun progression can be, 2-3 closed lip kisses, then some tongue, then start running your hand along her side.

**Eighth lesson: to defeat last minute resistance

When I went to take her top off, was totally chill, and just kept the sexual kissing and touching. I noticed again, she started getting horny. So I went for it again. Totally worked.

Just keep trying. You can literally watch a girl's resistance slowly erode.

Edit: thanks to generalmishap

*I do not advocate pushing a girl to do stuff she's not comfortable with!* When she stopped me

Super importantly, how was she touching me back? Did her breathing rate change? What noises did she make

You can often tell when your girl is getting horny. Once I could obviously tell she was horny again

**Lesson nine: at some point

I was on the couch, set her down, and continued. We were having sex within literally 3 minutes. Something about moving to the bed for this girl meant sex. So I was able to not waste any more time.

If you recognize that a girl has given up resistance, and then bang.

**Tenth lesson: have good sexual skills.**

This doesn't get talked about very much here

What really helped me out here was David Shade's Sex Manual. Holy. Shit. Is this book good.

Things I learned from it: how to talk to women in bed, dick, bedroom etiquette, etc. Find this fucking manual. It's been discontinued, you can probably download it from somewhere. Imagine how much confidence you'll have when you know, REALLY KNOW, that you can please women fantastically.

**Lesson eleven

I actually liked my girl. She's cute, and plays video games. What more can you ask for, right?

Well, she stopped trying to be so cute. And I actually enjoyed conversation a lot less.

*I would never had known this if we hadn't had sex!!* Sex brings out the real her. Meet the real her ASAP to see if you actually like her. Aaron Sleazy is big on this

Truth is. I fucked up.

Let us begin.

Thursday the 6th of December. The University Christmas ball. I had a date. Let's all her A. Me and A spend the entire night together

Before the actual ball happened

Fast forward the day after the ball. We went our separate ways and before I left I told her I would text her the plan for Tuesday

Around 9pm I texted her saying 

'I really enjoyed last night :). Tuesday, _____ park and watch Romeo and Juliet at 6.30....x

No response. The next day I texted 'Stay at mine for the night afterwards you Geordie **(inside joke, I have a pizza and movie with your name on it.'

one hour later she replied 'Maybe'

This woman is hard I say to myself. Next day I panic about the maybe and text her saying 'I just hope you don't snore like the Kraken again XD I came back from the toilet and Caroline was like 'RISEABOVEIT. FOR THE LOVE OF GOD MAKE HER STOP'

No response. Fast forward to the day we are supposed to meet.

3.09 

ME : taking your sweet time to get here

her : Where are you now? 

me : (station name ) Platform 2

her : Get a train to (the city that she lives in)!

me : (City name!)!? What about the play?

Her : I have no money at all

INSTINCT. For many people, it's ok!' and my 2nd said 'No, continue on your own to the play, you have friends there, your old teacher is waiting for you. Go!'

I chose the first instinct. Damn.

I got the train there

**For the entire night?** I ask

I see this chump. I introduce myself, ill as anything and she's just come from his house. 

I ask what's the plan then? Your house?

She thinks and agrees and we start walking. Her in the middle.

This chump is taking all her attention. Inside jokes, she simply says 'Not spending it in (city name) *aka the city i'm from, because she knows i'm gathering a big crew up to sleep at my house after a massive night out*

I brush it off and we keep walking. I'm slightly annoyed but I try to hide it. How can she bring another guy ffs.

We are all in her bedroom. He is lying on her bed

My first instinct kicks in again. 'Text her to get rid of him' or 'Endure it'



I slyly text her saying 'Get rid of him! I came here to spend time with you not him!'

She see the text and replies 'Can't

First instinct kicks in again. LEAVE or ENDURE.


**Endure

So I said

her : You're leaving Riseabove it? (She almost sounded sad)

Me : Yeah I can still catch the train

Her : wait, she bends her head to kiss her on the cheek, i don't'

I leave and start walking back in the freezing cold. She texts me saying 'Is everything okay?'

*I panic

I reply 

me : It was nice while it lasted

(you may be wondering about why I send something so dramatic

her : What does that mean?

Me : It means I don't come all the way to (city name) to see you for you **yeah i made a booboo

her : I'm sorry. I didn't know you'd be like that :( I thought you'd enjoy meeting my friends'

I panic even more **ohh no SHE WAS JUST BEING NICE

me : I'm coming back

me : I do. Let me make it up

**bet you're all cringing at this point. I would. What a fucking moron I am.**

I start walking back and she rings me saying look we'll meet up another time, NO i'm here just lets discuss this

I make my way back into her house and she takes me outside, I tell her about why I was annoyed, I planned a trip and she just brought a guy, I felt like **shit** i say to her. I say 'So what, are we even dating? It doesn't feel like it' she replies I don't know. She doesn't let me kiss her i grab her hand and she pulls away and I make her pinky promise to meet up another time, she pinky promises and we go our separate ways. I can't recall too much of what I said because it was an adrenaline filled blur of panic and me looking like a complete **BITCH.** Just imagine fucking up 100%. I ran back to her house I was out of breathe. I WAS SO BETA. fuck the word beta, i was pathetic. NOT AWESOME as I usually am.

She texts later at night asking for an explanation and how she just wanted me to meet her best friend in the world. I give her a monologue about how **lets be honest

She apologises and says we can meet up just the two of us. I ask about next week

I wait 3 days

She doesn't reply so I responded today saying 'You forgot to reply saying 'Oh RiseAboveIt

Tbh I should have texted her famous the 'Hey didn't hear back from you so I'm taking someone else. Maybe another time'

I may have missed some details out. I don't know it seems ages ago now. Either way I'm pretty sure she's not going to respond to me. I need to move on don't I? How goddamn dare she bring another guy to a date. FFS. Whatever. I need to find a fucking date for this weekend.

GOD it makes me so pissed. I'm not totally in the wrong. **SHE BROUGHT ANOTHER GUY TO A DATE** and then **I REACTED POORLY*

DON'T ASK IF YOU CAN KISS HER!!!! I hate this; every girl I know hates this; I have never met a girl who says she likes/appreciates being asked. Many girls will say no even if they had previously wanted the guy to kiss her! It makes her feel like he isn't confident. 



There are two scenarious:

1) You ask to kiss her. She will either reject or accept it.

2) You try to kiss her without asking. She will either reject or accept it.

Either way

A girl wants a confident man who can brush off rejection with a laugh. Don't look embarrassed or upset. Joke about it,"" and take a couple steps back, but smile and change the subject. Don't ask about seeing her again. Talk about something funny and make her laugh. Don't move toward her again; let her come to you. 

DON'T hesitate when you're about to kiss her - just go for it! Hesitating to think about it gives her time to hesitate and think about it



Getting Sex:

If a girl says she doesn't want to have sex/wants to slow down/etc.

If she wants to slow down but not stop

Proceed to kiss her, hold her close. Let her set the pace. You will get farther with her and make her feel comfortable with you.

If she says she doesn't want to have sex, but we'll do whatever you want."" Then move completely off of her and lay on your back. If she makes a smart ass comment or joke about how of course you want to have sex because you're a guy, don't respond. Let it linger. Don't make a single move toward her.

She will eventually say something like, but kiss her and let her pull you on top of her. Kiss her passionately but don't try anything else. Let her get riled up and ask for more.

No matter what, so you have nothing to lose by trying this technique. Backing off makes you seem like you respect her, are a nice guy, are trustworthy, and that it's her decision. 

Gettin' in Dem Panties:

Don't just dive into her panties with your fingers or try to take them off without turning her on first. Kiss her and put your thigh between her thighs and let her rub against you. Use your hand to rub her through her panties until she gets wet. Then push the crotch of them aside and rub her softly. After that, and grind your erection into the crotch of her panties. Dry-humping is underestimated! Do it until she wraps her legs around your waist and starts moving with you, then try to take off her panties again. If it's going to happen, it'll happen then. If it's not going to happen, lean back and start jacking yourself off slowly while kissing her. The moment she reaches to help you, take your hand away and let her. At least you might get a handjay or some head.

Good luck!

For some years now, my interests always ahead of everyone's, if not the only important thing. This didn't bring me happiness, nor did it bring me abundance as I've always wanted. Sure, I've gotten lots of girls all these years, way more than I would have had I not studied seduction. But they didn't ever ""fill that gap"": I was never truly happy, and I could tell they weren't either. Furthermore, most of these girls always had some sort of problem where they were a perfect match for my don't-give-a-fuck attitude. But this rarely ended well

I started hitting the gym, and in the end, same results. 

However, related to getting more women in the end. This mentality made me either not give as much value as I could've given, or even worse, take value instead. Since I noticed this, I've been working on shifting my way of looking at life to a new purpose: improve in every way possible, so as to give value to everyone. And for the first time in many years, I feel like I'm on my way to true happiness

Now that my purpose is to leave everyone at a better place than where I found them, socially) are now oriented to having a life where I have so much value to give, everyone is, if only for a moment, happier for having met me. 

So what I guess it comes down to is: shift your focus. Elevate everyone. If you've been hitting the gym to get ripped and get more girls, no matter who. You don't need to step too much out of your way (or be a doormat who is at the very whim of the people you try to help), but do help when you can. 

If they don't appreciate it, keep them in there. Those are few and far between. 

When you start truly practicing this, etc. Your mind won't be wondering about IOI's, negs, and all that stuff. You already know this, but since your focus is to give value, they will be drawn to you (of course you can then charm them by being the suave motherfucker seddit has taught you to be).

I had originally planned to further elaborate on speech, and writing, but a small comment discussion in part 1 lead me to want to talk about physical presence and body language instead. 

When it comes to speaking, but it’s here as a reminder and in a different context. 

&gt; **Posture**

Stand up straight. Duh? When you force yourself to stand up straight, or delivering a presentation of some sort, I’m sure you can imagine why this is helpful. When you give a speech, a good posture is a very subliminal “I know what I’m talking about.” As it portrays confidence, and security. 

When you sit, and you are also paying attention. Leaning in has its purposes, but this should not be your default, nor should slouching, or sinking into your chair.  


&gt; **Shaking hands**

You’d think this one is a no brainer right? Before you shake their hand, don’t reach out too far, and don’t keep your elbow in too close. When you do go to shake their hand, look them in the eye – you’re greeting them, not their hand. It’s also important to have a firm grip, as to other men it shows that you are a fuckin’ man, and to women


&gt; **I DON’T KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH MY HANDS?!**

Kino. If you’re making a speech however, as a form of pacing, and expression is welcomed. Speaking with two hands is actually more convincing (I will find the source later). This is for all walks of life, selling things, describing things, suggesting things. 


&gt; **Tone**

This is a form of non-verbal communication that doesn’t actually use your physical body to display. This is often a sticking point for people who start out, or they compensate by shooting bolts of refined energy in form of words. For those who think they are monotone, or they have issue in portraying the correct tone, there are a few ways you can improve this;

**Record yourself** – Say a word or repeat a line or use an opener on yourself. Do this in multiple times, neutral, and completely harmless, but in relative terms, it might come off as intense, or aggressive. With practice, you will have more control. 

**Change your tone, then deliver what you were going to say. When you are happy, you sound happier. When you are serious, you sound serious. This is method acting 101, but without delving into the depths, you can take the simple method with you and use it to your advantage. 

Part 3 comes out later.

3. **Be fun** - This might sound vague
4. **Be bold** - This is all about outcome independence. You have to realize that some women will just reject you. Do not let fear of negative outcomes keep you from doing what you want to do.

I feel [simplepickup](http://www.youtube.com/simplepickup#p/u/11/pcNE3yx_3D8) very clearly demonstrates that it really doesn't matter what you say when you approach a girl. I've even found that girls will tend to relax and open up more when I fumble my words. I don't know the exact science but it seems to work.

The number one most important is how confident you are. You can try to ""fake it till you make it"" but I think its much easier (and logical) to just acquire some real confidence in approaching strangers.

With real confidence

Real confidence is when one has complete faith in themselves. One with real confidence doesn't doubt himself. If something doesn't got the way he wants, and learns as much as he can from the experience.

It seems a lot of beginners are asking the wrong question : *how do you do it?*

I feel the more appropriate question is : *how did you learn to do it?*

I don't know how the other guys here learned to approach girls and (hopefully) get their numbers but I can tell you how I learned and this is my *number one tip for beginners*.

**Talk to everybody**

There's no doubt about it in my mind. I improved my social skills because I forced myself to be social. I didn't literally talk to everybody but I started seeking out conversations with strangers more and more. Sometimes they went great and I made a new friend

Regardless of the outcome

As I got better and better at starting and **keeping** good conversations with strangers of all sorts

I gained confidence in my ability to brighten a stranger's day and the more confident I became the more easily I could brighten a stranger's day. This is because [people respond positively to confidence](http://www.amazon.com/What-Every-BODY-Saying-Speed-Reading/dp/0061438294) (&lt;- dry as hell but a must read). 

Eventually

The great news is that being comfortable approaching and talking to strangers makes it that much easier to approach and talk to cute girls. Sometimes it'll go great and you'll meet an awesome chick

Even the ""worst"" interactions (protective boyfriend/father shows up, she notices your friend is filming the interaction) are blessings in disguise because they make for great laughs and an effective reminder that [it's just a ride](http://www.disclose.tv/action/viewvideo/18385/Bill_Hicks___It_s_just_a_ride/).

That actually means I comparatively suck at isolating girls

Much of Seddit consists of field reports, tips and so called ""secrets"", I've managed to break down everything I've read into 7 key topics, all of which are broad, but I think my insight will help a lot of you grasp exactly what we're talking about. 

Before you continue adopt the mindset of making YOU your special project

7. START WORKING OUT
   Jesus. This is not that hard. Did you know that once you do something 12 days in a row it is established as habit? the first 12 days of any workout regimen is the hardest, you walk around the rest of the day confident with great endorphins, and feel good. I can not overstate the impact that 50 minutes of exercise per day will have on your game.

6. POSITIVE ENERGY
    This is crucial, make good eye contact and smile, no one will think you are creepy. If you come in second guessing yourself, avoiding eye contact, and are so focus on what you say that you can't smile, you may come off as not ""alpha"".

5. BE YOURSELF
    I have always hated this piece of advice. What does that even mean? Be yourself? it's shitty advice without a definition to back it up
Realize first that you are not weird, no one can say these experiences have not happened to you. Nothing you say in the moment will be weird if it comes naturally, SAY THE FIRST THING THAT POPS INTO YOUR HEAD- it'll allow you to relax and really understand what being yourself is all about. it doesn't matter what you say, as long as you keep up your positive attitude.

4. ""LOVE OF MY LIFE""
    this is the only line I think works consistently; if you are having a conversation with a women and she mentions ANYTHING in common with you, smile and laugh. this is a fantastic line because it can be interpreted two ways: if she likes you, she'll take it as a funny and flirty compliment, allowing you to smoothly transition to an admission of attraction. If this girl is not attracted to you, she will only take it as a joke. Feel free to use this line liberally.

3. WOMEN ARE MORE SELF CONSCIOUS THAN MEN
    Seems hard to believe sometimes right? Especially when approach anxiety is so strong that you can barely even stand up straight. But it's true. Women are raised in an environment where pretty much one thing matters: looks. I guarantee you that no girl you see out in the street, is confident in the way she looks. These women have been accustomed to seeing the same things on magazine covers and on tv: exaggerated figures of beauty (think an airbrushed kate uptown on the cover of SI Swimsuit.) How many of those actual stunning women do you see outside of the media? 0. These so called normal women (not celebrities) look at this picture of a touched up kate upton and wish and wish that they looked like that, when in reality, even kate uptown does't look like that. Women think that THIS is the way they need to look to be considered truly beautiful. Thats why complimenting women works so well: all they want is to feel beautiful, and very very few feel that way naturally. You may be walking around all day feeling like people are looking at you, judging you on your looks, but in actuality that conception is much stronger for the female gender. WOMEN are actually so nervous about people looking at them throughout the day that all they think of is themselves

2. KEEP GOING
    Practice makes perfect; the more girls you talk to the more fluid your conversations become. Just like working out it's the first 12 that are the hardest. If you can talk to 12 girls, you've upgraded to yellow belt. thats all it takes. Learn to love rejection and failure: seems impossible, but if you successfully adopt the mindset that you are outcome independent, you can actually learn to start liking getting rejected. There is a video from long ago where Chris Farley hit on girls for an SNL skit; he got rejected time and time again and all he did was laugh and move on. Perfect. Do that, even if it hurts. Again, like the gym, each time you feel the pain of getting rejected, sure it hurts but each push up

1. ITS NOT WHAT YOU SAY ITS HOW YOU SAY IT.
    Approach anxiety is the beginning PUA's worst enemy. AA manifests because of our own insecurities, NO ONE WILL THINK THAT IT IS WEIRD. Say ridiculous stuff with a smile, and you'll see that women respond well to it. I have an example with my friends. I have two close friends, we'll call them A and B. A is confident, he always smiles when he speaks, and he is good at engaging women in conversation. B speaks slowly, like an old man almost, rarely smiles. Both A and B can go up to the same girl

I hope I was able to help some people out

1364819966.0,1bf2l0,Average guy. My short life-story with my weekend recap.,Debonair_Gambit,355,119,54,"I stumbled upon seddit and this is about to open a new world for me. I never knew there were communities like this. Let me tell you a little about myself.   

Background: I'm an average guy. I never really picked up anything better than a HB6. 
I was broken my senior year in high school when I told the girl I was dating I ""loved"" her
My freshman year I met another girl. We became friends quick and I told her how I truly felt about her and she rejected me. Again my soft self was a bitch and a fucking loser. 
So I decided to change myself. To just have flings, why not live in the moment for a while, I have time before I consider getting serious. 
I began physically working on the way I looked by dressing nicer, women began noticing me more and more. It felt great, but this wasn't enough. Soon I began hitting the gym. It was slow progress, but was totally worth it. I became more confident in myself. 
I've been improving myself for 2 years now. All on my own, 6% body fat, I'm an average guy that worked hard and woman now would consider me an 8 instead of the 5 I once was. 

At first It sucked getting rejected and I hated it. I'd get down when I was rejected and ask myself, I analyze what I did and focus in on what I could have done better.

For those looking for the perfect openers or easy pick ups you need to come to a realization that there is no such thing. If you're an average chump like me, ""you're not just getting that? Are you?"" (They were all fruits and vegetables in her basket). An opener can be anything, just talk to them. Another time I commented on a woman's ""pumps"" she was surprised I knew what they were called. I said I had a sister (I really don't though). We hit it off. But I digress this isn't what I wanted to focus on. 

My recent story: 
My buddy calls me up and asks if I want to go to the bar
 When we arrive on scene there is a ratio of girls to guys in our favor. 3 girls for every one guy it seemed. Mostly because there were some homosexuals that kept to themselves in the corner but would converse with the birthday girl from time to time. So first thing we do when we get there is take shots with the bday girl who is a HB8. Me and her hit it off pretty well (I happen to work with children so when I say what I do for a living women usually let their guard down). She happened to be studying child development so she was an easy catch. The night progresses and I go and meet all these other women nothing really eventful happened so I'll skip ahead. 
I'm getting pretty drunk at this point and people are starting to go home.  My buddy is talking to a few people he knows so I ditched them to find the HB8 birthday girl. When I found her I pull her towards me and start making out with her, and I ask which bed is hers. I throw her on her roommates bed and say, ""things are going to get dirty lets not ruin your bed"" this builds her sexual desire and we make out a little more—I had no intentions of hooking up with anyone so I came unprepared and didn't have condoms. I casually ask, ""do you have any condoms"" 
""No
At this point I'm thinking that this isn't the best idea. So I need an exit. I was still fully dressed and she was in her underwear — her dress was easily removed during the interrogation. She takes off my shirt and notices that I'm fit and stops for a moment. She makes the comment that ""this can't be real and you're too good to be true."" Fuck yeah, I don't have a condom, she says she is on BirthControl, ""I'm too good to be true."" Obviously there is something wrong with this girl if she kept saying that this is ""too good to be true."" 
So at this point, ""this IS too good to be true. You're too drunk. Snap out of it."" I say all this while I'm putting my shirt on and walking out the door. She just stared at me as I walked out and close the door behind me. Found my friend who happened to be looking for me cause he was ready to go and we both dipped. 

You guys probably think I'm a fucking idiot I should have f-closed. I want to know form you guys what you would have done?  Fuck her? Or walk out?  You tell me.  
I've f-closed women in my past

I'm not a PUA. I'm not a ladies man. I'm an average guy who has worked hard at improving himself. Now that I found this community I know I can grow significantly. Many of you have stories and mine might relate to some of yours. If not then sorry for the long read.

* **Stand up straight and look ahead


* **Be stylish.** It doesn't have to be a total makeover, and stick with it. Pick one out of a fashion magazine or website.
If you can


* **Take a public speaking class.** This is a valuable life skill


* **Learn to dance.** Good dances to learn are West Coast Swing and Salsa. Hip hop dancing can be good to learn too, and ballroom style is just as intimate, if not more so, than hip hop. If you take a class to learn, you'll meet new people.


* **Learn an instrument.** Most girls I've met like acoustic guitar and drums. Acoustic guitar, try learning to sing and play at the same time.


* **Work out


* **Play a sport.** It's exercise, a martial arts class may be a good option. Learning to defend yourself will, of course, improve your self-confidence. Just don't go looking for fights, most girls hate and are embarrassed by that kind of behavior. 


* **Get a job.** People like guys who show some incentive and who aren't broke. You don't have bring home a huge paycheck


* **Volunteer** if you have the time or are looking for a job. Whatever you volunteer for


* **Learn to cook, however, my favorite way to learn was to have my grandmother teach me. You can spend quality time with your family and learn an important skill at the same time.

* **Learn how to give a quality massage.** This can be tricky, shorter, and cheaper classes you can take, you just have to look hard enough. Of course, almost every girl will love a good massage.

* **Have self-confidence.** That doesn't mean be arrogant and brag about yourself. If you do a few of the things on this list, including girls.

So im going to start from the beginning.  I apologize in advance for length

It was september 2010, who was really passionate about programming.  This was a fucking turn on for me.  I started talking to her and we quickly became study partners.  I would text her almost daily.  This was a big mistake.  I think she was into me nonetheless.  I finally got the balls to invite her over to my place to study instead of the library.  She fucking set up camp on my bed.  I sat at my desk like an IDIOT.  Didnt make a move.  Sat there imagining hooking up with her.  I had only made out with one other girl which is a funny fuckkkking afc story, but i digress.  

The school year came and went,  there are billions of fish in the sea.

I decided i would stop communication with her, not the game.

Fast forward to this year.  I showed up to my first day of physics (Week of Sept 1)and guess who was in my class.  Keep in mind I got tanner,  ill call her HB8.  Me being my new confident self, i compliment HB8 on a pin she had on her backpack that had FSM on it (Flying Spaghetti Monster, for those of you new to free thinking).  I made her laugh a bit and after lecture i #closed and set up a homework sesh at my new pad.  HB10 saw all this shit go down.

She sent me a text the first weekend saying we should hang out.  I told her i was busy all weekend with club activities, I thought the friend zone was like a fucking 40 man raid boss with a 10 man group of ret pallys. (WoW analogies 4 life)  I knew i had her intereest back, and I sure as shit wasnt gonna blow another opportunity.

I was finally able to pencil her in like 2 weeks ago.  We pumped out a program for our systems class and i showed her some of my projects (i wrote an android app over the summer - mega compsci DHV) and we hit a bowl out of my vape.  I decided to bust out a bottle of 2 buck chuck and we commenced our evening.  She saw my playstation 1 and asked if i had crash team racing.  I k-closed her right there. That was too much.  We made out for a solid 30 mins, and I motherfucking accepted the challenge.  Then we got our pillow talk on deep into the night.  I felt like a million bucks.  This girl was fucking great.  

I asked her out the next week,  and I'm fairly confident this will be a solid relationship (you never know though, obviously, but I'm hopeful).

The friend zone is in your head guys

A big thanks to this community

So a really interesting [post was made by blackhatseduction](http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/102oz4/seddit_we_need_to_talk/) as to the quality of content here on r/seduction. I agree with everything he said. This subreddit has become too focused on Inner Game, I have been organizing a training regimen for some other sedditors who really needed help. I had already written most of this when I saw his post and realized it addressed most of blackhat’s concerns.

My goal here is to organize the chaos of pick-up related content around the internet and turn it into a format from which people can derive lessons and learn pick-up step by step. As you read on you’ll find that I have broken down pick-up into different categories and sub-categories. Each subcategory will have related content pulled from third party sources to study. Let’s work together to make sense out of this chaos. *Please let me know what you guys think in the comments section.* If this is popular I will make regular updates with more recommendations/assignments to read up on.

So without further ado

**Mr. Right’s Seduction 101 - The Components of Pick-up**

In this lesson you’ll find that I have broken apart the venusian arts for you in a way that is easily understandable. I’ve even prioritized certain components, such as Qualification or Frame Control.

The reason I’m giving you all the sources

So let me breakdown the art of Pick-up for you. The key components to effective pick-up can essentially be broken down into two categories: “Inner Game” and “Outer Game.”

Inner Game is exactly as the name implies, they often fail at first and it shatters their confidence. Then they give it up. This will not happen to you if you are truly willing to make a change within yourself and work hard to realize your potential. Let me reiterate, THIS IS NOT EASY OR SOME MAGIC PILL. You have to work-out, change the way you think and even change your lifestyle.

**Components of Inner Game**

1. Self-Confidence
2. Body Language / Posture
3. Outcome Independence
4. Frame Control

Then there is outer game. This deals with the techniques you employ during interactions with women. It takes a while to master all of these

**Components of Outer Game**

1. Kino Escalation (INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT)
2. Eye Contact (INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT)
3. Opening
4. Qualification
5. Frame Transference
6. Compliance Tests
7. Neuro-linguistic programing (Skeptical as to whether or not this works)
8. Last Minute Resistance Techniques
9. Bouncing
10. Demonstration of Higher Value
11. Logistics
12. Conversational Threading
13. Voice Control / Tonality
14. Social Circle Control

Got all that? Good! As you work with me

 I had been in 2 relationships in the last 5 years, only one. It said, Come to Seddit.........so I did. I started by going over the basics, and I noticed that the main theme was putting yourself out there.

 So I did. I read how to approach, for the longest time, I wasn't putting it to practice, I would just stay home, and usually drink in misery (Though I admit it was fun misery.). I got my first real time to practice when I got back to college at West Virginia University.

 I hit the ground running, but regardless, I'm keeping my focus on women at the current moment.) I felt awkward, I got some rejection, but I got much more positive results than what I expected. Then one night, I find myself in bed with a Chinese foreign exchange student, double teaming her with my best friend.

I reflected on it, combined it with the social lubrication of alcohol, and applied it the next female I encountered, and boy did I nail it (And her). I don't see what exactly has changed, but I know one thing. I am happy Seddit, something I was not before. I think I feel myself changing, and with that, with tears in my eyes

Two weeks ago, so now he helps me out) went out to shoot some pool at some irish pub. Nothing planned beyond that. Halfway through our second game, I can FEEL the glances I'm getting from these two hispanic-looking girls near our table, an HB7 and an HB8 . After some light teasing, they both jumped in on for a team game (but of course, we made them wait til we finished ours, don't want to look too eager). While BS'ing in between shots, one from Brazil and one from Argentina. I speak spanish well enough to get by, we finish our second game

Fast forward a week, and wants to know if she can bring two of her girlfriends. Uh, yeah? Duh? So, the group who organized the meetup is running late, I'm running late, *everyone* is running late. I end up being the first one to the bar, and it's an hour after we were supposed to meet. So, and make friends with people in my area, and they're loving me

I had to think of something, women will get bored/distracted if there isn't someone there they can focus on. So I call up two male buddies of mine, give them the rundown, and they're in. They show up 30 min later. The night is going well, but we've been in the same place (which is really dark, loud, and crowded by this point) for a while

Finally, and the other is Colombian. The Salvadoran is a 9.5, absolutely stunning. At this point, my buddies are ecstatic, and get to work keeping the girls entertained. I continue to focus on Penelope. I make an executive decision to change venues, and suggest a gay club nearby. They've never been to one, so they're intrigued. 10 minutes later, acting a fool, and he comes along

About an hour into this, which I am, so he works his gay magic. He nonchalantly melds back into the group, we head back in, and he buys Penelope a drink while we head back out to the dance floor.

I have no idea what he said, who gives me a thumbs-up with a devilish grin. This continues on for the remainder of the evening, until the club is about to close. As we are all standing out front, making sure everyone has rides and whatnot (side note: I managed to snag HB9.5's number at this point, too), I let Penelope know I'm leaving, and slightly opened my arms as if to say ""where's my hug?"" She jumps up and wraps her arms around me

I still have no idea what Chad said.

1339259376.0,utb44,"The elements of Seduction; Attraction, Comfort, Sexual Interest - A brief overlook",PrincePUA,280,33

(I'd also like to point out, succeeding since april, working in may, and enjoying myself again)

Seduction is the action of enticing someone in such a way that they feel compelled to comply and engage themselves in a romantic nature with the seducer.
 
Seduction consists of three things:

-	Attraction
-	Comfort
-	Sexual interest

Its essential to build upon these three criteria’s in order to effectively ‘seduce’ a girl

**Attraction**

Attraction is created when an individual comes across as interesting, confident and desirable. Essentially these are mutual characteristics with what we define as Alpha, again stressing why I believe through seduction we demonstrate ourselves as Alpha’s.

-Interesting

The ability to come across as interesting is almost as ambiguous as the art of seduction itself

*The most interesting man in the room is not the man who tells the most stories

It is essentially to show your interest for others to make allow others to see you as interesting

-Positive

Positivity (which I would like to point out I despise that word) is best defined through someone who is happy
 
I cannot stress enough how important it is to be non-critical

-Fun

To be fun is to show an independency of judgement from others (a.k.a. not giving a fuck) and to clearly show that you’re having a good time. Again it is vital to point out ‘smiling’ and animating your emotions are essentially to build this kind of frame.

-Confident

To be confident is to voice what you think

-Desirable

To be recognised as desirable is to own the room


**Comfort**

Comfort is more often than not the easier of the three to build upon

To build comfort is to establish a connection with someone such that they trust you to be themselves around without the fear of rejection. It’s crucial to remember every bit of information they choose to reveal when building comfort (their name, and when you get better you'll effortlessly find a *natural flow* in your interaction (and you won't be interviewing them!)

**Qualification**

I would like to also make a point on qualification; it benefits both attraction and comfort, as well as building momentum towards future interactions (as she will feel both more comfortable around you and more interested/attracted to you).
 
Qualification should be used when enough ‘compliance’ has been built to make the girl either justifying her self-want OR telling you about herself (you have the power to put whichever spin on this). 

Mystery’s ‘infamous’ question is always solid: *So what have you got going for you more than your looks?* – However it is important to not come across as aggressive or malicious in these questions

Don’t ask too many questions

**Sexual interest**

By far the most delicate trait to put across in a cold interaction; to display sexual interest is to show the girl you ‘want’ her and to get her to reciprocate the intention. 

-	Displaying Sexual interest too early = you look like a creep/afc/every other guy

-	Displaying sexual interest too late = she has already decided that for the night you’re not a sexually appealing (a.k.a. friendzone)

So it is paramount to be delicate when showing sexual interest. Too do this make good use of kino (I feel like I’m really going on a bit, sexual tension. Sexual interest is ambiguous and its probably more felt that thought about; although kino esculation is essential

My personal recommendations to read upon: DiCarlo esculation ladder, how to win friends and influence people (carnigie), Sinn,

This guy was a late-bloomer who got into the game in his late 20's. Unlike most Asian Americans, takes care of his body (in a non-metrosexual way), and awesome body language. He's at the point in his life where he's on the fence of settling down for the woman he loves or continue searching. Anyway

**Low Frequency**. If women could choose two men that are exactly the same, something that isn't stressed, but similarly true is that women prefer a low frequency guy over a high frequency guy.  Low frequency is probably the most important attribute to have for attraction, keeping women happy, and keeping yourself healthy and stress-free.


**What does low frequency mean?** A lot of times guys are told it's good to be the life of the party, entertaining, etc. However, while this might pique interest in many women, what's more attractive is a man who is generally low frequency. This means walking fast by taking longer strides, slowing down your responses to stuff people say to you, letting your smile come out slowly over several seconds instead of doing a quick grin, chewing your food slowly and really tasting and enjoying it

**Listen to the words coming out of your mouth.** Don't just respond to what is said to you. Speak slower and actually listen to each and every word you say as if you are listening to someone else speaking to you. Try this for second. You become very self-conscious of how much filler-language your brain spews, people will listen to you, value what you say, and want to give you the time of day.  Think of every famous, popular, and attractive man. Low frequency.

**No more monologues.** Most people say what they are thinking when the speak. This is monologue-mode. This is how the vast majority of people communicate: two parallel monologues instead of a listen-think-respond communication pattern. Listen to the words coming out of your mouth. Is what you're going to say valuable

**High-frequency isn't always bad.** It's sometimes great to let your brain's autopilot takeover and react without care for anything other than how you feel, being temporarily high frequency when something good happens is a good thing. People love how players act when someone scores a goal in soccer. It's also occasionally necessary to be high-frequency to get many things done in a short amount of time, at work for example.

**But too much high-frequency is draining.** Ironically, this will quickly devolve into the person wishing you would just shut up and leave him/her alone. My friend told me that he used to think it was necessary to be the wittiest person in the group and tell awesome stories, especially in trying to get girls. However, he said that the less he said, only speaking when it was truly valuable did many more wonders than trying to be the best speaker in a group. He asked me to look at people, and you can see who is high and low frequency pretty easily if you're looking at this attribute. If you engage a high-frequency person, they ironically will take away energy from you rather than the other way around.

**The less you care the more stuff happens.** He told me the less he cared about entertaining people, and even more girls came. He is not an asshole. He is not a nice guy. He is very observant of people and only accepts good people into his life. He is extremely successful in life, and takes this no-care low-frequency attitude to everything, not just with girls. In a couple of words: outcome independence.

**Women, listen to this advice. High-frequency game might get you laid, but a long-lasting relationship will get to be draining if you are always easily excitable, fidgety, reactive, monologue-speaking, etc.

**An Excercise to get low-frequency**: Sit in a comfortable chair. Close your eyes. Listen to your breathing.  Shift all of your focus to your right eye for several seconds. Then shift all of your focus to your left eye. Then shift all of your focus to your mind's eye, no fidgeting, etc.

**Is it true?** I had to think about his advice for a while.  To me, and allows his high-frequency self to come out when he gets excited.  However, he doesn't run on auto-pilot.  Everything he says is filled with meaning, intent, and determination.  So personally, I think my friend's advice is correct.

**TLDR**:  Be low-frequency,False,,t5_2qhrv,True,,,t3_t3ipf
1333027952.0,rj6yg,"How to improve yourself each day, become outcome independent, and love life no matter what it throws at you.",mammarymuffintop,289,45, it's pretty obvious



We're all here to improve ourselves, they know they want to start seeing some results with women, or something equally vague, but they don't *really* know what they're working towards. They're just hoping that if they keep this stuff up, maybe something will one day click and they'll suddenly be living a life that would make their past self envious. Thing is, that's not going to happen by accident.

I'm not denying that these guys are making improvements in their lives - they're doing plenty of things right and their commitment to self-improvement is something truly commendable - but the progress they're making is just a side effect of what they're doing, frustrated that they aren't improving like they once were, beginning to question whether they really achieved anything at all. It's a shitty situation to be in, but it's easily fixed. The fact of the matter is that these guys lack direction. They're trying everything in the hope that something will provide the solution they're looking for, when all they needed to do was focus. Decide where you want to be; figure out how you're going to get there; then start walking.

Do you start driving your car without knowing where you're going? No. You know where you want to be and you use the knowledge you've acquired to make the correct turns to get there. Don't know how to reach your destination? You seek external help in the form of a map. You learn a new set of directions

If you found yourself lost in the middle of a giant forest, and then another one. You could waste your final few days wandering around, barely committing to any one plan of action in the hope that by some miracle one of your half-baked ideas would save you. Or you could pick one direction and stick to it. Walk in a straight line. Sure, it might not be the quickest way out of the forest. You might face some pretty daunting obstacles on your way. Shit, you might have been 100 metres from the edge of the forest in the other direction, but you sure as hell weren't going to find that out wandering around aimlessly. You decided on your path, stuck to it despite any challenges that arose



Now



My idea is simple - every day set yourself three achievable goals, you achieve them. You don't just pick the goals at random, though, otherwise you're just aimlessly wandering. The goals stem from your **priorities**. You need to decide on what is truly important to you in life, and why. These priorities could themselves be goals, or they could be principles, morals or ideologies by which you try to live, or attitudes towards the world. Whatever form they take is personal to you. What is universal is that they are at the core of everything you do

Pretty simple



Do you see how this ties in with the promises in the title?



It's pretty obvious how this will help you improve yourself each day. If you stick to it



But what about becoming outcome independent? It's pretty simple really - if you feel like shit because a woman rejected you, but that also caused her to be unable to tell anyone about it? You probably wouldn't feel like shit then. You'd feel pretty great knowing that she wanted to drop to her knees on the spot. But wait a minute, in both of these hypothetical situations you did the exact same thing. Literally the only thing that changed is your perception of the woman's reaction. You're allowing yourself to feel shitty over the exact same set of actions that could have earned you some mentally unstable head. Do you see how stupid that is? The outcome of your actions is completely beyond your control, so why allow it to affect how you feel? Outcome independence is what happens when you become fully aware that you can only control your own actions. Everything else is utter chaos to which you can only react in the moment with no attachment to either future or past events. Having priorities at the core of everything you do allows you to create your own value. When you are truly passionate about them you will never need to seek external value or approval again.

I also promised that this exercise will help you love life. It will make you happy if you do it correctly. Nothing will fill you with happiness



To summarise:

* Decide on your priorities. The things you want at the core of your life
* Set three goals every day. Achieve three goals every day.",,t5_2qhrv,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/rj6yg/how_to_improve_yourself_each_day_become_outcome/
1332638295.0,rc4dr,Beginner Sticking Points – Where Most Rookies Get Stuck [RSD Nation],throwaway1234xxx,271,36,16,"It is Saturday night and I am a sick. I was going through some old RSD posts

----------------------------------------
Hey Fellas

Doing bootcamp week-in and week-out

**Approach Scanning** – This takes place before the approach even happens… the guy scans the room looking for a girl to talk to, you miss 100% of the shots you don’t take, so instead of seeking out all the reasons why not to approach, let your thought process be this: “Girl…Hot Girl…Get Hot Girl.”

**The Decaying Orbit** – Here we’ve got a guy who’s decided to approach, I am A MAN ON A MISSION. Nothing will come between me and her, and she knows it. Move dominantly and with purpose…let her see you’re a man who goes after what he wants… a man who grabs the proverbial bull by the horns. 

**The Far Talker** – Any guesses as to what distance you want to be when talking to girls (in a club)? The answer is about 1 head length…this is a LOT closer than you think. Get comfortable being close. 

**Going Interview Mode** – Game is expression of self. If the spotlight is on her then by default it means self-expression is at a minimum. Go first – put yourself out there and let her follow your lead. So it’s not “What do you like to do?” instead go first and let her follow… “I’m really into snowboarding” will usually be followed by her reciprocating by telling you what she’s into. Share your opinion… don’t be some impartial reporter



**Growing Roots** – Guys

**Fighting Against the Current**: Look, when I see a girl’s drink is empty I say “I’m thirsty, come with me to the bar”. When you see a girl looking around to see where her friends are, pre-empt her walking off to find them – “Hey, we haven’t seen your friends in a while…let’s go see where they went.” Really, what’s she gonna say…”No”?? “Fuck you”???

**Spinning the Wheels** – Ok so you’re at the club, you can only have a friendly conversation for so long before it gets BORING. Or, even worse, before she thinks you’re a prude that’s scared to escalate. This is SOOOO common, guy likes girl, girl likes guy… guy and girl talk for an hour…guy does nothing to escalate either physically or verbally, guy and girl go their separate ways. Girl concludes guy doesn’t like her, develops eating disorder. 

**Filler Speak** – This is where the guy is scared to reveal himself and his own thoughts and feelings

**Not Communicating Interest** – I’ll make this simple. A girl won’t like you until you like her. A girl doesn’t know you like her until you TELL HER you like her. This can take place verbally or non-verbally – but if you have a problem with this make a resolution right now that the next 100 girls you talk to will get told either “you’re hot”

**No Physicality** – Simply put

**Assuming It’s Not On** – ARGH

**Ignoring the Friends** – Take a moment to introduce yourself and chat to her friends

**Not Trying for the Close** – assume you’re closing

And lastly…

**Giving a Fuck What Other People Think** – Repeat after me…”I DO NOT GIVE A FUCK WHAT ANYONE THINKS ABOUT ME”. Good… now say it like you mean it. 

Cheers
Ryan

1351655948.0,12dqs4,Most girls at bars/clubs are not with the guy they're talking to.,bl1y,307,71,45,"A lot of guys get frustrated early on when they go out and have a hard time finding a girl not already chatting with a guy. But odds are

You know who he is? He's you. He's a random dude chatting with her until he gets blown out or closes. And sometimes he's a friend she's not interested in or an orbiter she's out with just because she's bored.

The number of guys who are actually with the girl is about 25-35%. This is based both on my own experience opening a zillion sets

Of course there's a caveat. It depends on where and when. If it's a raucous sports bar, you don't take girls there. It's the hookup-friendly environment where this rule applies.

When you go into a club, not three guy-girl couples in line.

So now

Right off the bat

As for whether you should open a mixed 2set, and I'm not going to tell you how to feel about it. Being polite to other guys has pretty clear merits, but then again, I'm way more interesting than that dude, so why make her suffer through him just because he got there first? That's not fair to her.

The more interesting issue though, Cosmo is generally a load of bunk, and I've even made a few bucks lampooning them for College Humor, but this one thing is spot on: If a guy is standing next to a girl, they've got something going on.

Think about how you're positioned when opening a stranger and how you are when you're with a girl you're in a relationship with. When you're opening a set you're often facing the girl head on or forming a 90 degree angle. (And if you're facing her head on, like you're delivering a sales pitch. There's a bunch of negotiation theory about this.) When you're with a girl, you sidle up next to her to be closer, and so you're both facing the same direction, allowing you to look at the same thing, talk to the same people, etc.

So, they're just *trying* to get with her. And, the more head-on the interaction is, the more likely it is they aren't together, and the closer to being side-by-side they are, the more likely it is they are together. And finally, try not to put yourself in the head-on arrangement. It's uncomfortable for her, and will signal to other guys that you're not with her and that they should rescue her from you. Don't sidle up next to her right away

**Introduction**

This instruction is the culmination of over 4 years of experience and training in the “seduction community”

* [Full course syllabus](http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/kwcpy/free_training_course_for_those_in_the_dcmaryland/c2nr6y2)

**Logistics &amp; Investment**

Logistics are the single most important aspect of finding success. It means having proximity to women you desire. Placing yourself in situations where you are around the women you want to be with, regardless of your skill with women, will improve one’s odds of being successful.  Logistics can also make or break an interaction, and is one of the few things we have total control over in many respects. All it takes is a little foresight and preparation. However, there are situations where bad logistics can also break a perfect situation no matter what you do. This is why preparation is key, so to avoid problems in the first place as much as possible. Good logistics can also benefit you in a variety of ways, which is discussed in class.
Investment is the second half of this equation in that the more you’re around someone, yourself being minimally involved, she’ll be more invested than you are. This is great for men and it’s very empowering. Ideally though, investment levels should be about even. If you over invest though you risk coming across as needy or clingy, so for the purpose of training you should look to keep your investment level lower than those you are interacting with.



**Comfort &amp; Rapport**

Comfort is key when approaching. If the person isn’t comfortable with your presence then you’re fighting an uphill battle. The goal when you first approach should be to make them as comfortable as possible. If you are nervous
Rapport is comfort plus a level of familiarity. You need to build this before you can break rapport (not sever it) as breaking rapport is also known as something else….flirting. 
Metagame &amp; Propinquity

Metagame is the overall framework of the social interaction at large. It’s the birds-eye-view, passing by other people you could have talked to, but then going indirect with those hotties simply betrays your intentions and makes you look wussy. 

Propinquity is what gives us our perceived value to others. In the context of this course it can be best thought of as a mixture of preselection and social proof. Another factor in all of this is the mere exposure effect

**Verbal &amp; Non-verbal communications**

Verbal communication means your inflection, and so on. What you say isn’t nearly as important as how you say it. Being comfortable talking to strangers and “holding court” takes time and practice. I strongly suggest joining Toastmasters as this is what they’re all about.  
Non-verbal communications are largely comprised of eye contact, as well as playing a part in building comfort &amp; intimacy. 

One of the biggest problems I’ve seen is that people have an aversion to making good eye contact, check out Toastmasters. An easy way to practice on your own though is to force yourself to make eye contact when walking past people. Look at someone you’re passing as you walk in opposite directions at about 10-15’ away. Look at their eyes and try to note their eye color. Say hi or give them a head-nod and keep moving. After a while you’ll develop a feel for how much eye contact is too much or not enough, eventually getting it just right. Experience is the key. As a rule of thumb, until you find out what’s right for you, try to maintain eye contact for about 2-3 heartbeats.

When approaching, is an amazing tool for getting someone’s attention. 3 fingers on her forearm for just a moment to get her attention is all that’s needed. Another option is the back of the hand. I’ll go more into physical escalation later, but for approaching this is all that’s necessary.

Last night I went to a club for a friend's birthday. 

While there I met a headhunter who, which he is supposedly knowledgeable about. It turned out that there were *less* things in common than I initially expected. One major difference is headhunting is very immoral - you manipulate/lie to people on the phone / in person to giving contact details. If you are a good headhunter then people get really pissed off at you. Good seducing is very different.

It was a question though, and she was unable to answer as her mind was too flustered with sensory overload. We knowingly smiled at that and then I placed my right hand on the back of her head and massaged it as I drew her in for a long kiss. Our lips just grazed and we breathed on each other for a bit, as that was the type of kiss the moment called for.

I took her in the house and made tea. I was a little cocky and we laughed a lot. She said she wasn't going to sleep with me and I replied ""We hardly know each other"" (not a yes or no response to her no-sex statement). Some readers will disagree with saying this as it reminds her we just met (I think its OK to say

We talked about Pinterest for a while and question how it go so big (though its not really hit the UK big time yet). I like Pinterest as its a software startup

We made out in my bedroom for ages. She resisted me undressing her for 90 mins+. I didn't bother with freezing her out. Maybe I should have. Instead of freezing her out I pinpointed what made her extremely aroused (should I call this ""pinteresting""?). What tipped her over the edge was making her imagine my cock was inside her while she was grinding on me. Talking dirty was a weakness that I've been working on lately.

1367141664.0,1d9k1q,[FR] F-Closed 2 set (cold approach),asimplegame,298,67,48,"I don't see a lot of FR's that go from cold approach to f-close (perhaps because most sedditors aren't cold approaching?)

The scene:
Out at a bar that was having a theme night with my room mate/wing. I'm at the bar when I spot a two set (HB6.5 HB7) immediately to my left. I hesitate for about six seconds, she lights up and immediately says 'sure!' I can tell she's attracted, HB7 seems unsure, but HB6.5 appears to be the dominant of the two so I'm pretty sure it's going to be easy to get to the hook point.

'So

We talk about first dates, just lucky). Hey! (I put my arm around my wing). This is the guy who's going on the first date. Now the girls seem even more engaged (the power of a rooting your opener)!  

The four of us stand around and chat for another few minutes, because &lt;observation about her&gt;.' I find this makes for a more fun conversation than asking 'where are you from?' even when an assumption is wrong, she'll laugh and tell me I'm wrong and we can talk about why I made the assumption. Plus sometimes I'm right. I didn't guess accurately in this case (but it didn't matter).

For the next 30 minutes I talk to HB7, but isn't trying to get in the way.

As we talk I steadily kino escalate (standard escalation ladder), I triangle gaze and say 'I'm trying so hard not to kiss you right now.' she smiles, I go for the kiss, she's very receptive (note: at this point it was clear to me she would kiss based on the kino escalation up to this point, kissing did not feel like making a leap, the beauty of smooth kino escalation).

A bit later my wing comes over and quietly suggests we location change (smart!). 

Next time the four of us are standing together I bring up a really cool bar in the neighborhood I live in

At the new bar I'm just having fun with it, let's go smoke [weed], our place is nearby'. From earlier conversation I knew the girls smoked. My wing and I have gotten many a 2 sets back to our place to smoke weed, I think it serves the same function as 'I've got a great bottle of wine', though our success rate has been very high (of the last 4 two sets we've said this to, 3 came back to our place).

As we are about to get in the cab HB6.5 starts piping up like they should bail. I maintain a strong frame and continue going through the motions of piling into the cab

After about 10 minutes I look over and my roommate has disappeared (he later told me he said to HB6.5 'I want to show you something'

I started it on my ex

A few weeks after we broke up I was over her house clearing up my stuff and I fell asleep on her couch. When she woke me up to take me home I basically channelled McNulty and said 'how about a fuck for the road?'. We didn't fuck

I kept this going and noticed how much she enjoyed it. Not relentlessly but if I saw a funny way to bring up having sex I would. And its so fun to do it. 

I started doing it lately with our female friends in my circle. Normally it's very unsexual but after a few weeks they 'get it' and it leads to some funny interactions. 

Now my ex calls all the time and we have a good relationship. I know I'm still on her mind whereas before past relationships delved into bitterness. The females in my group may not be seduced per se but they definitely look at me as sexual now and that sort of image of 'if I am alone in a room with him I will sex him'. 

It's really good for my confidence and keeps you in the zone which I love being in. 

The key things: never overdo it

Some examples of things I've said:
-have you ever had your back door smashed in? You wanna?
-if any girl moans about bad sex I say 'you ain't met thumper yet have you? And look at my cock. 
-if we hug I do so many things
-if we saw a girl in underwear I would say things like 'oh you would look hot in THAT' or 'she looks like you' while looking her up and down. 

I hope people realise by now this isn't for any sort of relationship. It shows you as someone who doesn't take sex all that seriously and for a girl looking for meaningless sex your top of the list. 

All the girls I do this to love it. I think they enjoy it for what it is but also because they feel good about themselves. But never be rude or threatening

Ok. So, DHV from being known in the bar, kino) until I upped the ante.

""Listen

She blushed, she dropped me off where I had to be, and I felt like going out, so I called in another 1.

We went back to the same bar. (I don't hide anything about my lifestyle. Me bringing 2 girls into the bar back to back in the same night and having them both be into me will give me a reputation for a long time). The bartender I know had just gotten off and invited us to the next bar, then had a drink and bounced again.

We walk into another bar, easily a 9 face and dresses well. It took me one second to realize I'd have guys coming onto her, as one other AFC tried earlier, and I laughed and destroyed his value to her. 

""Aww

Also

""Watch

Like I was fucking Miss cleo

So backtothegame in his magnum opus field report talks about knowing the furniture in the room, with 80% dudes, all staring at my girl. I take her to the far end of the U (top right portion) and sit her on the outside, and side inside of her, with a 2 set (with their respective guys) sitting to the inside of me. I diffused her looks with 2 pretty girls. and also set it up so she was on the outside.

From there we are chatting and everything is going great, look at my tattoos."" I just kind of smiled and let him try, he had failed within the first minute, and I destroyed his value, he's no threat now, so I back off and open the girls to the left of me.

""Hey, what'd you do to chase them away?""

""Oh my god

She was kinoing me to show what the guys were doing

""Oh my god

Then after a bit

""So what are you two? are you together?""

Me - ""Well

She laughs and says that's her favorite band

""Hey

My date pulls out her phone and looks it up, and my girl does on the other thigh. 

My date finds the song and tells us

She goes ""I don't believe you"" but notices that she had her hand on my thigh. 

I go to the bathroom

So I come back and my date had moved closer to the girl. closing off my spot. I get inbetween the two and push my date further to the outside. Remember

So I open the other girl in the 2 set

Staring.
""How old is this tattoo?""
""yadda yadda.""
""It has aged really well, we have terrible artists.)

I was right and really into it

""Alright, show me your A game. Pretend I'm a less handsome guy sitting at the bar. Hit on me.""

BOOM. She started kinoing me

Anyways

I didn't slow my pace

It was a beautiful night

**Takeaways**

* Don't hide your reputation

* Don't be afraid to ask a bartender you like for their number, she's also bubbly, and I tip her well, and she hooks me up. My number pull was literally ""Hey, I go out a lot and you're a pretty fucking boss bartender, give me your phone number so I can find out if you're working on those nights."" Go to them a few times before you do this, but it will DHV every one you bring in. 

* I live at home. I had some family issues yesterday

* a great way to flip the tides and turn a platonic thing into a sexually charged way is to tell them to spit game at you. then critique it. When it comes to your turn? There was a line Usher did on the tyra banks show. She goes ""How do you talk to a girl?"" and was heavily pushing for them to qualify, and reframed everything. I did this when it was my ""Game"" turn. Don't qualify.

1322437989.0,mrc05,The results of my social experiment (What girls seem to find attractive),jeddit1,338,107,146,"Okay

I am a long time user of Reddit

Before we get started

1) I am in no way endorsing acting like something you are not or behaving in a particular way. I am also not saying that a particular way is 'right'. I am just sharing my findings with you.

2) I am not an expert at picking up girls

3) You may already know this, which is why I created this post.

So

For the past year I have been switching between two different 'personalities' for want of a better phrase. Please no obvious jokes about split personality

For one, nice shirt, keeps himself tidy and acts confident and friendly but respectful.

Kind of like a young professional.

For the other

When I dress like that I act more nonchalant and usually keep my chin up a little

I guess one makes me look like a professional guy

What I have found (which, but for me, this confirms it) is that I get SO much more attention from girls when I am dressed like a 'bad boy'.

Also, every time bar one, its when I was dressed more like a 'bad boy') 

I am in my late twenties, I actually get a little scared thinking of the younger girls acting that way towards me. One girl who wrote her number on a napkin and got her friend to give it to me was actually 16. (I asked her friend how old she was) Obviously I threw the number away (not in front of her) and politely told her friend I was too old for her but to thank her anyway.

It literally is scary to me how younger girls seem to seek out my approval and attention and give me looks when I dress more like a 'bad boy'.

A lot of this will seem very obvious. We all know the 'girls go for bad boys' phrase, but when you experience it first hand with such a marked difference, its very interesting to see.

Saying that

The other day at a restaurant a women who was having dinner with who I would assume was her husband kept glancing over at me and smiled twice. At one point when I went to use the restroom

I do find

Just to clarify

The funny thing is, she has almost ignored me.. Then going back in again dressed in the casual stuff, she carried on flirting obviously with me.

Just as a final point

So, girls give me WAY more attention and would be much more open to being approached or picked up by a guy if they have a classic bad boy look about them.

Whilst we all knew this was said to be true

Final note, there are 100 girls who would never be interested in me. I don't change my confidence level or the way I do things or approach situations when dressed in either style, so it pretty much comes down to how I am presenting myself.

Anyway

I had opened up a bit but I still had approach anxiety and was still very self conscious. Hell

Now we move to this past Saturday night.  There were ladies everywhere. Don't know what was special about this night but there were countless more an usual.  I approached 2 that I found attractive and seemed cool, everyone else was in a group and I figured the night was over as far as chances are concerned.  Music was blaring, and I figured well, I might as well enjoy myself while I'm here.  I began to dance to the music, by myself.  Now whenever I had danced before it wasn't much. It was fun but I always felt awkward and self conscious.  Well, this past Saturday night I decided, I don't give a fuck.  I came to the realization that I am here to have a good time and if anyone else stares, whatever - that's their deal.  I started going at it, everyone on the floor had noticed me and started dancing with me.  The ladies were all over me.  I had never ""grinded"" until that point, having a blast.  I can honestly say it was the best time of my life.

Out of this experience, I had my first kiss with a girl.  Yes, cheesy but I had never kissed anyone before.  She was an 8 - gorgeous brunette.  Final count: 5 phone numbers and 1 kiss.

So, why not get started now and work on your methods.  If you are self conscious about doing something that you enjoy - understand that everyone in that venue is there to have a good time.  Nobody cares what you do or how you do it.  As long as you enjoy yourself and meet your ultimate goals, go for it.

TL;DR - Fat guy here



Edit - Response to All:
I did not expect anywhere close to this kind of response.  You have no idea how much I appreciate the input from everyone.  Saturday night changed my entire perspective on everything social in nature, nothing more than getting to know one another - was a good time.  Have an outing planned with the second later this week and the final wants to meet up for dinner with her group of friends this coming Saturday night prior to attending the same club.  I have transformed from a socially awkward guy who cringed at the thought of being rejected and too scared to make a move to I don't even know what...

I've learned a lot from Seddit these last few months, having gone from rarely getting laid to having two steady fwb and other one-nighters and dates on the side (all while being completely honest with all involved, I might add).

But now I have a problem that has fucked up my game and forced me to withdraw. One of the women I slept with had genital herpes, so I figured I'd be alright.

Well, but it's compromised my confidence and I'm dreading the thought of having to bring it up with new women before I sleep with them.

1367847533.0,1dshp5,A quick guide to clubbing,enriquex,355,126,151,"**Can't stress this enough

I've been reading that a lot of people hate clubbing and I think it's because they're not doing it right. Well

Clubbing isn't for everyone. It's full of the most superficial people on the planet. Fortunately, clubbing was literally my only option to meet young people (18-21). Bars are full of an older crowd, so I was thrust into the world of going out every night (except Wednesday). 

As stated previously, but fixing the aesthetic side of things made it *a lot* easier. Don't lift, buy nice clothes and smell nice ""just for club girls"", do it for yourself. Looking good and feeling good are important parts of life in general, but unfortunately looking good is the defining factor in clubs. 

So, the asian one, the wog (im wog so I can say it ok!) and the list goes on. Most of them are open on different nights and have a different age group as well. I know for a fact that one club has 18-21 year olds on Thursday and 28+ on Saturdays. Choose wisely, because if you go to an 18 year old one and you're 26 you look like a flog, and if you're 18 going with an older crowd you look like a cute kid.

Who are you gonna go with though? You've found your club but you need your mates! The best nights I've had were with 2 of my best friends. The more people you have the worse it gets

So you've found a club with a great line up, maintain eye contact but sexy smile and make sure you give off a fun vibe. Grab her hips or hands or w/e, gauge her interest, go in close (this is why smell is important) and say literally anything (""what's your name?"" ""you look good, but can you dance?"" shit like that). If she's keen she'll wrap her arms around your neck. If she isn't, do it for her. If she resists, smile and walk away. If you don't really like interaction for whatever reason, just grab her hips and if she grabs your hands you're golden otherwise don't bother. Ask her name or whatever in her ear

Hard bit is the group of girls or the one with the fat friend. Groups of girls obviously are harder and since you can't talk to all of them at once you can't win them over with your charm. What I like to do is get my mates involved. Each take a girl and it becomes 1v1. There might be a few girls left over but that's ok, your friend has to take one for the team. Also, it gives you a joke to tell your girl (but be careful) **you joke about your wingman not her** I can't reiterate how important it is to keep the fat friend under control. Last Thursday I was dancing/making out with a girl and as I was about whip out my phone the fat friend literally drags her away and yells ""I'M GOING HOME OK YOU COMING?"" Last I saw of my club princess ;__;

Now you're dancing with her and making out. It's going great - stop her and ask for her number. If it's late, just make up some excuse and pray she's not clingy (""My mates are going, see ya"" ""Oh shit, just got a text my mate fell in the toilet brb""). Sometimes she may not give you her number. That's fine, all she was looking for was a cheap club hook up. But if she felt something SPECIAL then she'll give it to you. 

Final tip: If you're a manlet like me

And that's pretty much a typical night walk-through. It really is easy, smell nice and have an aura of confidence about you clubbing becomes almost too easy.

I made excuses as to why I couldn't approach girls to satisfy my ego. Back in my day, I have an interesting life (long motorcycle trips, etc) but still can't get over approaching a girl.

My last relationship ended over a year ago. I had some unsuccessful dates from online dating but nothing from spontaneously meeting people in public. A few months ago I had met a friend of a female friend. Instantly thought she was cute but found out she was in a relationship. For some reason, I finally found a great MJ connection.) We're having a great conversation and I finally go for it. I tell her I think she's really cute and I want to kiss her. Complete rejection follows. She tell's me she has a semi-serious boyfriend, she's flattered, she thinks I'm intelligent (WTF? You're not my employer, at least tell me I'm cute).

**And if felt great to be rejected.** I would have preferred a little make out session but 2nd place sufficed. We hung out for another 10-15 minutes outside. Very little awkwardness. We walked back inside. She told me she thought everyone was going to think we were having sex. I told her that that was my story and then told her I was going to reverse our roles when I told our friends about what happened. We hung out at the bar some more and had some laughs. No real awkwardness at all. I finally left when I got bored but got a tight squeeze on my way out. Boyfriend or not

Seriously. ,sedditpro,303,79,86,"This is coming from a comment I just read on here from a guy who wanted to know how to get better at bantering and stop having dry humorless conversations. A common malaise of the logically-inclined. 

Yesterday I was at my friend's place

Now, we thoroughly enjoyed it. But the best part? The banter between Archer and the girl sidekick. Archer is the consummate Alpha and it shows. He can do no wrong in his own eyes, and even when their boat is sinking and they have a gator circling around them, he is chill and irrationally self-confident. That's the attitude you want to learn. That's the attitude that you want to be able to pull off with a hot girl, so she'll be wondering whether you are really all that, and guess what - the only way she can find out is by having your cock train go steaming up her love tunnel. Choo choo motherfucker. 

Backing up a bit, not only because it makes you laugh and takes your mind off of the social anxiety of going out to pick up, but because you'll be able to recall some funny lines from the show and spit them out when the moment demands it. 

I'd say that if you feel you're not that good at banter and coming up with funny shit on the spur of the moment,,False,,t5_2qhrv,1342157332.0,,True

Yesterday, we got chatting just about anything. We shot the shit and eventually her bus arrived and she departed. 

Exactly ten seconds later, I would've come and sat here sooner but I didn’t want to move the old woman"". From this we got talking about her travels and places she'd like to go, conversation was pleasant, fluid and filled with laughs. After about 45 minutes of this, she said she had to go although she really wished she had more time. I was feeling confident and smiling with a sense of purpose I took out my phone and told her to put her number in it, she obliged and then rang herself to get my number.

While it's unlikely this will actually go anywhere, the unexpected might happen. It’s a state of mind at all times, not just when you're on a night out.

I wish it was as simple as the 40-year-old Virgin movie scenario, but it's a combination of a lot of things - shyness, some bad shit that happened a long time ago, living in hick towns for too many years.

But anyway

I would like to hear from any guys who were older virgins who were able to beat their curse and start having a normal dating life. How did you do it? 

Like I said

Some things I've done recently to get myself on track: 

1. Deleted porn and trying to go 7 days at a time without spanking it. This has already helped noticeably by making me more open to dating women closer to my age (just finished an episode of pursuing a 20-something woman that was never going to pan out

3. Called the cable company and got my TV cut off. I was spending too much time watching reality shows and bullshit that I didn't even like very much. I could spend that time working on my resume or going out. 

4. Updated my OKCupid account and started talking to several women. Got a date tomorrow. My previous MO was to go through dating sites with a fine tooth comb, but I need to learn your ways until I can find someone I really want to be with and can be with. 

5. Made a point of making conversations with women I see in public. Store clerks

6. Got serious once again about losing weight. I've lost 10 pounds since March. I've been doing a lot of walking/hiking/bicycling. 

7. Deleted my long term Reddit account. I found myself karma whoring and wasting way too much time talking to people who were like the me that I don't want to be anymore. This is kind of a throwaway account. I'll keep it for subreddits like this one and r/productivity
I need some advice about a few things like: wardrobe (especially on a budget), not much money - I'm also contemplating a career change, so hopefully I can do more, later), how you got over the fear of approaching women in bars, any ethical/practical problems with dating women who have children. 

I don't believe it's hopeless and I am not going down without a fight. One thing that is so weird is that I beat the shyness professionally - I'm a newspaper reporter. I could interview the president and give no fucks. 

I've got a persona I put on that over the years feels like me, no attraction. I ought to be able to adapt my interviewing skills to dating...

Anyway

I'm in the business of meeting and attracting people, so be prepared to translate to fit your needs.

- Be gregarious and friendly.  Talk to everyone you meet, a restauranteur, or a puppeteer.  Stop for disabled cars on the road.  Know how to change a tire.  Help people find jobs.  Help recruiters find talent.

- Approach everyone like they were your neighbor.  Are you nervous that they might not want to meet you?  Why wouldn't they?  You're a great guy to know!  Maybe they don't need what you're selling at this moment

- Be the master of ceremonies.  Make sure everyone is having a good time.  Be sensitive to the needs and desires of those around you

- Be trustworthy.  Some things are best kept confidential.  Sometimes it's not about whether or not you can keep a secret

- Know when to STFU and let the other guy talk.  Never

- Listen with your whole body.  Turn your shoulders toward her

- Learn to read minds.  Mirror the body language of the person you're engaging, and help lead her to a better emotional place.  Meet her where she is emotionally, and then slowly lead her where you want to go.  If you fail to match her emotional state, you'll come off abrasive and repellant.

- Be the man of the moment.  You don't need to be in control all the time -- you are big enough to play a supporting role.  Know how to be an awesome wingman.

- Elevate those around you.  Be the player that makes the entire team look good.  Always look for ways to give credit to others.  Compliment people sincerely through third parties -- it will get back to them

- Take accountability for each interaction.  Don't allow yourself to use someone else's emotional state as an excuse.  Ask yourself

- Don't be a dick about it.  Approach people the way they want to be approached.  If you don't know, or phone calls?  When is the best time to call?""

- Never be afraid to talk yourself out of a sale.  Sometimes the best way to sell yourself in the long term is to be the better man and do everything you can to help the prospect reconcile with their existing supplier.  Never undermine someone else -- if you're really the better man, no matter what.

- Above all, and lives of their own.  If you get a negative response, maybe you approached them at a bad time, or approached them in the wrong way.  People have bad days.  If someone snaps at you, give them space, give them time, and be more careful about how you approach them next time.

He was quiet, shy, and frightfully inexperienced around women. This young man had a crush on a woman thirteen years his senior. She was beautiful, and had a certain movie star-like quality; in fact

Over the course of several years, she discovered the crush he had on her, and carelessly dismissed it.

He found himself a veritable captive

Then something happened over a year ago. 

He'd heard about pick-up artists, but most importantly - single. The few times he managed to procure a date, he was hopelessly miserable trying to stay in character.

Shortly after

One day, rather, it was UN-learning. He noticed how open and free children often are, completely uninhibited by insecurities that adults possess. They're free because they're not stressed about details. 

Fast foward to the present. 

Almost every weekend I'm going on dates. I didn't have to sacrifice my principles, I simply have as much fun as I can, as often as I can.

Oh, the ""one who got away"", my Mount Everest was mounted on top of me. I suppose that's what motivates me to write this. I know there are people who think that success and change are far beyond their grasp, and they'll have to work with what they've got. That's not true. Everything in your life can be changed. Here are some seddit-inspired principles I've utilized to completely transform my life.

1: Be first. Be the first to initiate conversation

2: Notice shit tests and murder them, and you're such an old lady, but you're still giving me an erection."" 

3: Hold your head high. Pretend like someone is constantly pulling your hair up. 

4: Don't give a fuck.  Do what you please. Make it aware that you're primary concern is enjoying yourself. My go-to technique for initiating ""Not-giving-a-fuck-mode"" is blowing a raspberry. It's the most playfully ridiculous thing anyone can do

5: Never make a woman your highest priority. Women can smell it a mile away, and never sacrifice your own needs. It's not being a douchebag, it having self respect.

6: Act

7: Oh, I hold my gaze above people's heads and focus on what I need to do, not reacting to my environment.*Rule number 6* That being said, always hold eye contact when talking to someone. But again, act, don't react, and don't give a fuck. If the conversation is boring

Hopefully these tools will help some out like they've helped me. Just have fun and be high energy. Don't absorb energy, andf you're creating happiness then people will like you and good things will be sure to follow.

So there I was

So I started asking random girls to dance. The first one shot me down. The second one said yes. The third one shot me down. The fourth one shot me down. The fifth one said yes. And so on and so on all night. I kept count of how many girls said no. My previous record for one night was 5. This place blew that record out of the water with 14.

Somewhere along the way, you can't lose. You either get rejected, or you get a dance. (or in normal cases, a conversation) Either way, you're having fun. Getting rejected by random girls I've never met doesn't hurt me in any way. They don't know me. They've never talked to me. The don't know my friends. They haven't seen my job. The haven't seen my house. They haven't seen my car. When they turn me down for a dance, they're not rejecting me as a person, because they don't know me as a person. I know I'm awesome and I don't need anyone's approval to believe that. All it means is that they didn't want to dance with a guy they don't know that night. It's their loss!

Like others before me have said

**Back Story....**
When I was first moved to the NYC area (2 years ago) I wasn't used to approaching girls on the dance floor...in Chicago at the clubs I would go to you could really just grab a girl and she would grind on you. In NY my friend and I go to mixed clubs (we often go to Fat Baby in the LES). I decided I would just two step all of the time in clubs and look nice but that wasn't working for me. One of my friends' college buddies called me out on it once


**A couple of things to know......**
1) Its not a great idea to approach from behind unless you know what you are doing (especially in mixed clubs). I would tell everyone not to do this unless you can really dance well or she's already given you an IOI but she still may not want you to do it. 99.9% of the time approach from the side (I usually dance next to the girl and bump her on the shoulder to get her to notice I am there.) or from the front. Example of how to approach girls on the dance floor http://youtu.be/1fVpL7Je4Qc

2) Have FUN

**Common dance moves at clubs....**

The Two Step - this can be literally be done to ANY song. The most basic of dance moves besides a head knod.
http://youtu.be/L3QrP1kiRko

Slow Grind - easy to do and it will get you brownie points if you know how to do it.
http://youtu.be/4s21sg0goqM

The Dougie - the song is almost always played in clubs and bars if you know how to do this dance you will draw crowds. 
http://youtu.be/NJxYiIfr4WM

Gangnam Style - this song is still played 
http://youtu.be/bjQKCLvtLN0

Salsa Dancing - can be done to just about any song and if you know how to salsa you will be The Man.

I call myself a semi-natural. I never had much of a problem with meeting women as I'm outgoing, looking into PUA has hypercharged my game, making cold opens (my main weakness before) much easier, and the escalation ladder has helped speed up and ensure closing tremendously.

I was out at a local bar for a friend's birthday the other night. I wasn't really there to game unless I saw something I really liked so I mostly hung with my friends and opened a few sets just for practice

Also out with us was one of my f-buddies (HB7) that is learning how to wing for me. A group of her co-workers showed up later

""You're having problems thinking of what to talk to her about
""Uh
""Ask her something where the answer doesn't matter. Some kind of opinion question. Those are the ones where the conversation can lead to somewhere, unlike a yes/no question."" (I gave him a few examples, including ""my 16 year old sister wants to get a 'tramp-stamp' tattoo.. is she too young or am I just being overprotective?"")
""Huh.. that makes sense.""

I then explained the escalation ladder a bit, then hand on shoulder a bit when talking to her and keep it there *just* a bit too long, etc. He was rapt with attention to me and swore he'd do it.

I also told him my favorite way to get a number, just an unspoken command. I also do the ""give me your phone"" to send myself a text message (of ""You are cute!"" or something similar but related to the conversation) but felt that took more confidence than he had at the moment.

He went back, hold her hand up with yours to get a better view. Hold on to it just a bit too long like I said.""

He grinned and when I walked away did exactly what I said. Her response was positive. Later on he was putting his hand on her shoulder to punctuate his conversation points like a fucking boss. I was so proud.

From there on he was doing well. Still a bit nervous but she was responding perfectly to his kino and was now invested in talking and hanging out with him. I decided he needed a DHV so I went over and said ""Oh shit man I totally forgot to thank you for that help with that project the other day. You totally saved my ass! You're the man!"" and did a little bow-to-the-sensei before walking away. I was the confident

When I got back to the group I was with I saw her put her hand on his chest for the first time with a huge smile on her face while she said something. My blatant DHV had worked wonders!

From there on he was on fire. He eventually did the hand-on-small-of-the-back when she leaned in to talk to him (it was quite loud in there)

Later I saw another girl sitting nearby talk to him (I think she made a funny remark about something he said) and when he replied he put his hand on her shoulder too and looked her right in the eyes. My small bits of advice had changed this guy tremendously. It was like magic.

By the end of the night he and HB6 were dancing together by the bar and lightly making out. He was constantly throwing me ""YOU RULE!"" messages behind her back

Though I didn't personally close (nothing I was interested in there) it was one of my favorite nights out so far.

* You *look* at her
* You lose the awkwardness because you're doing it for a purpose

Practice this with girls walking down the street. Some will drop their gaze, the kind of looks you would get at a club at 5am if you're gaming right. But it made my day anyway.

You probably saw my [epic FR](http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/r2a50/fr_absolutely_epic_night_fourway_with_porn_star/) from the other night. Had I not prepared myself to take advantage of the fortunate situation

But that's only part of the equation...

---

**SOCIAL MOMENTUM**

Specifically

The Friday night where I had the 4-way was my eighth night in a row going out. One night earlier I [got to observe Tyler Durden](http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/qzr3n/my_review_of_the_simple_pickup_guys_and_tyler/) rock it in field. The night before that I [picked up two 20 year olds](http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/qy7sj/fr_tofutofu_theengdude_pick_up_two_20_year_olds/).

I am convinced that my success on Wednesday night added to my confidence

Likewise

I'm not saying you have to go out nine nights in a row like me

Let your social momentum carry you through. You'll end up a better person for it.

However I am unsure what I should be saying next?  We usually just smile and thats it.  I know I should be making the approach but I am unsure what to say.  For example in the library the other day I noticed a girl making eye contact with me,,
1364882961.0,1bi0nm,[FR] Sex with model. All text game.,birdwontquit,280,57,44,"Met this girl while we were both quite drunk. We were at an outdoor party. There were a shitload of hot girls around and gaming was really fucking hard. Guys were being drunk and hitting on everything and girls were pretty unreceptive after dealing with so many drunken buffoons. I had the brilliant idea at some point that in order to deal with this we just had to go super direct and aggressive. Open girls by telling them they're gorgeous and stuff. Opened her up with some random shit, then after 3 dates I'm going to invite you over to ""watch a movie"", my aggressiveness is what got me the number


Next day I take a screenshot of the ""Movie Fuck"" contact page and send it to her. This is a trick I plan to employ over and over, I'll give some samples. Mainly of the fucking sea of shit tests I had to swim through. Starting right after we texted.



Me: Hitting up [the park] today with some buddies come by if you want.

Her: I have a thing to go to :(

Her: Thanks for the invite! We're not gonna have sex but I'd love to hang

Me: Totally. Anal only we talked about this.

Her: WHAT

Me: Lol you were really drunk eh

Her: I don't do anal

Me: I know you mentioned that

Me: We might not have sex

Her: I gotta rule it out

Her: I'm beautiful

Me: Haha are you married? Send me a photo

She sends a photo. She is beautiful.

Me: Wow you are beautiful. So long as your personality is good I'm going to have to seduce you.

Her: It's a push up bra

Me: Was referring to your face and hair not your false advertising cleavage. I'm an ass man though

Her: I'm hanging out with my bro. Give me an ass shit.

Her: Hahahahahaha shot!

Me: Lol I'm not into ass shits

Me: You're dirty




The girl then drops that she's a model. Just casually into conversation. I ignore it and respond to something else. She does this several more times



Her: Here's your butt shot. Don't try and seduce me anymore. It's not gonna happen for sure. I already have two guys on each coast and it's hard.

Me: Lol I haven't even tried to seduce you yet.

Me: I have 3 girls it's not that difficult. You give them too much attention.

Her: Don't do it. And what are you talking about. You're giving me so much attention.

Me: You're new. Everyone likes to play with a new toy.

Her: Jesus



Another time she asks me about some comment I made about some sad shit in my life.


Me: Long complicated sob story. I'll share it over pillow talk if we get there.

Her: Guess I'll never know. Dude stop.

Her: I like my bf. Did I tell you I have a bf?

Me: No.

Her: Are you crying?

Me: That's cool. I'm an aggressive flirt

Her: Obviously but this is fun right now.

Me: Lol no I'm not crying

Me: I barely know you

Her: I'm an asshole.

Me: You're trying to be




At this point she's very engaged. Sending me (non-sexual) photos. Talking about our lives. Saying she's never done this before and is enjoying the attention. I tease her in a blunt way that only a very secure girl can take, coming 4 times, scratching his back with her nails. I ignored it and acted unfazed. However I know I have a decent shot. At one point when she was drunk she texted me ""bf is being a bitch wanna meet up"". I knew they were having problems. Our texts took place over probably 5 days. It's important to note the brief shit tests are between endless texts about our lives, childhoods, parents, goals in life. It wasn't all douchebag sexual comments, it was a combination. I'm highlighting these because I don't want to share actual conversations and personal shit and I assume everyone can have a basic text conversation.


The meetup. At one point she asks me about what I do.


Me: I dunno I'll explain in person. Kinda complicated.

Her: In person? When's that happening? I didn't get the memo

Me: I'll let you know when I decide

Her: What?! No you didn't

Her: You decide?!

Her: Geez so aggressive. Oh well. I'm aggressive too.

Me: Ooh that can be fun. You wanna take the lead then? [don't try to be so ""alpha"" all the time]



At this point she invites me out to hang out with her and her cousin for dinner. I'm not really interested in that. I tell her I have a date (I do) and I'll come by after if I don't fuck. She wants me to blow off the date and come hang out with her and her cousin. I don't


Me: I'm giving you new experiences then.

Her: You like that?

Me: Like what?

Her: Giving me new experiences.

Her: You're totally rubbing off on me.

Me: Not yet. But I'm sure I'll be rubbing on you soon.

Me: Oh wait did I misread that?

Her: Jesus. Stop it you freak!



Next day her and the bf have broken up. He was being an asshole apparently, hair, and makeup, looking like a girl out of a fucking magazine. She's several inches taller than me with her heels. I'm a bit intimidated. Introduce myself to her (as it's basically like we're meeting for the first time), we hug, introduce to the guys and other girl, go to grab a drink. She joins me at the bar and we start chatting. The other girl and two dudes (who were stoned and not friendly) decide to leave, grabbing arm and leg for support while laughing hard (something I'm a big fan of as it's very natural and disarming). We drink strong drinks and catch a buzz quick. I open up two guys, I don't want to fuck these guys). Be generous to strangers, leave the guys tell them to enjoy their trip and we go. She tries to pay for her share of the bill



At the jazz bar she buys us a round of scotch while I get us a table. I select a circular booth right across from the band. Circular booth is great cause she has to sit right next to me. She comes back with the drinks, dancing and lightly drumming with my free hand. Occasionally we'll talk about how awesome the band is. The band asks for money. I give her a 5 and tell her to go put it in the bucket. She does. After a couple songs, we're sitting with her leaning against me and her face right next to mine. My mouth is next to her ear. I tell her ""give me a kiss"". She says ""here?"". I say ""yes"" and turn her head towards me with her chin. She does, we kiss for a few seconds and I cut it off. We chill for a while, the band finishes a set and I say let's get out of here. We decided to go to her place to drink some tequila cause it's close by. We argue, I'd rather go to my place not hers, but I relent. She orders a cab and we cab it there.


When we get there she pours drinks and put on music. We make out, makes me feel sleazy, so I genuinely intend to leave. I think she saw that and it disarmed her objections. End up stripping down naked and having sex. She wants me to spend the night, I say I can't gotta bounce work early and go home. We chilled for 3 days straight after that and had a fantastic time.

Honestly, it did.  She was so much more receptive physically after that.  Then she started complaining about a guy she was texting who ""didn't like her but always sent her dirty text messages"".  so my friend, being the amazing, triple-a wingman that he is, snatches her phone and tries to delete it.  She goes chasing after him, he hands the phone off to me, and she tackles me to the floor.

""Whoah

Later that night, just talking, having a good time.  Then she starts talking about that guy again and I just said ""Really?  Is this how you wanna spend our first night together?  Talking about some other guy?  He's sent you what, 1500 text messages was it, and he still doesn't like?  I've known you for all of one night and I already like you.""  This turned her to goo.  It was adorable.

Anyways, ""I don't know...""...""Really?  You already dry humped me back in the room, this seems like a pretty logical next step.""  ""Ok fine"" and then she proceeded to shove her tongue in my mouth.  I never really envisioned my first kiss being quite that...raunchy, but it was nice.  Totally felt some titty too ;) we held hands for the rest of the night, and I kissed her goodbye after we had both sobered up a bit.

Ever heard the saying ""if you don't use it

1) Looks: I began working out, swimming, rock climbing. Looks might not matter according to some, but they can only help. DO CARDIO! You will feel better, you will be more confident, buy new clothes, shave clean. 

2) Make yourself interesting: Start learning new things. Chicks dig that shit. Once I started taking part in a lot of outdoor activities, most women don't give a shit about your 25 man raids and the legendary sword you looted. But don't just pickup hobbies to have stories to tell. Actually go out there and do things you want to do - enjoy your life. Women like men who are happy.

3) Lower your standards: Unnatractive women are easier to approach. Its a sad truth. I had to go for women who were as desperate as me. Needless to say, meet women but set your bars low. I literally stopped giving a shit about my ego, or preconceived notions about who I deserve. Before I knew it I was playing two girls. I slowly upgraded over time.

4) Rejection: Take it. Live it. Love it. Laugh about it. LEARN FROM IT. Do not get attached and set your hopes on one girl. There are plenty of women

Where I am now: It took me 8 months
I am happy. I no longer care about my ex

First things first, as mentioned by Lowndes in her book ""How to Talk to Anyone""

The mood you set in your mind is reflected through your actions and how you communicate. Is is vital that you're not worried about her catching you staring at her. On the contrary, you did ;)

1344948920.0,y77mo,"A seddit primer on the sexual market place, hypergamy, and the origins of / need for game",themoor,267,44, how this effects male/female sexual dynamics

THE SEXUAL MARKET PLACE

I’ll start here assuming you know a little bit about supply and demand. Also think of the buyer/seller dynamic.  That said

Women used to have their status attached to the guy she married, simply a stable guy with a job to provide food and shelter for her and the children was enough. 

Then some things changed, and still others political and economic. Refrigerators, stoves, washers/dryers, and vacuum cleaners, for instance, greatly cut down on the time required for housework.  Feminism encouraged women to get educated, vote, birth control expanded and this allowed women more leeway on their reproductive careers. Laws have changed to give women more social provision (welfare)

In short, more free time, career opportunities, etc.  And, this means marriage at a young age, or if at all, is less and less a pressing issue for women (and men

HYPERGAMY

What the above has done is diminish the restraints previously in place that controlled women’s hypergamous impulses. Guys tend to want to sleep with a variety of women; women tend to want to trade up in their partners, which could be looks, income, the badboy that turns her on, etc.  Sure, men would like to fuck upward toward the hottest women, but really they just like to fuck a lot of chicks across the board. Tiger Woods did the Waffle House waitress. Do you think Angelina is gonna do the fry cook?
So, as do girlfriends and neighbors. Just read the forums and find guys complaining all the time about their women chasing some new asshole with game, with money, with status, with looks, or whatever. 

SHIT-TESTS

But some things haven’t changed. Not only do women get turned on by high status alpha males, but they don’t really have to. It is still mainly the guy’s responsibility and thus women want to have their cake and to eat it too. And why shouldn’t they? They get approached all the time regardless of the changes discussed above. 

So, mainly. (1) Are you alpha/high status/smooth/sexy/confident around women, etc? and (2) Congruence. If you present yourself with the traits of (1), then they need to find out if you really are who you say you are. So, shit-tests test for congruity. 

Sometimes this is intentional. But often women do not even know when they are doing it. The irony is that they ALWAYS know when you fail.

Also, out of shape, with very little to offer and they are asking for “Mr. Right”, “Prince Charming”, “A Soul Mate”, etc. Totally deluded but still convinced that some ridiculous dream romance with a top dog awaits them. Now just imagine how younger hot girls think.

GAME AS A RESPONSE

Game did not develop in a vacuum, the sexual market place, and sexual dynamics changed, a few guys started to figure out that something was up. What the hell is going on out there? Why are women so picky, choosy, manipulative? Why do they blow out seemingly good men only to literally blow the asshole/bad boy/alpha guy in the bathroom stall? Why do they ride the cock carousel into their thirties and then find themselves hitting THE WALL, single, and wondering “Where are all the good men at?”  

These guys started to try to deal with the new reality.
Some of it was a bit formulaic

But game evolved and something called a “natural” was hit upon. This view basically evolved from guys who were already good with women trying to figure out and conceptualize what they (or others) had been doing that worked. Sometimes they were not sure why

This has led some guys to dig deep into evolutionary psychology (a controversial area) and others to offer very harsh critiques of liberalism and feminism.

From the outside, this is not the origins of game. Nor do these guys explain the need for it. 

Success with game techniques also makes some guys look like Machiavellian poon hounds. This drives women critics crazy

Game is the new and evolving way guys are figuring out how to deal with women in world that has changed though no one told them (or the women) that it had.  As has been said, the mother of invention.

1374887913.0,1j4vuf,3 Effective Methods That Can Make HER Ask YOU For SEX...,JustinWayneDating,357,138,90,"We all know how frustrating it can be when you have finally climbed the mountain to sex with a woman

Here's a video of my infield demonstrating this: http://youtu.be/ZNoSIVe-biY


**AMBIGUITY OF VERBAL INTEREST:**


One thing that has become abundantly clear to me was that DIRECT GAME can sometimes naturally place you into CHASING FRAME in the female perspective. This can stifle your mid-to-end game since she may not be invested enough to go all the way with you. If you really think about it, for one, the girl does not know if the guy really likes her or not since guys in social circle settings are generally a lot more careful with regards to showing romantic/sexual intent too soon. By her not being too sure, her guards a much lower while, simultaneously, she is confused about how the guy feels about her. For instance, she may wonder, its all about mystery (and I don't mean they guy with the fuzzy hat:).  Let's take a quick look at some examples of Ambiguity of Interest.

On the Conversation opener, then say something you don't like or agree with... then say things like ""you would be such a cool friend/ but then physically escalate like a flirty hug. Confuse her.

Ideally


**STEADY AND PROGRESSIVE PHYSICAL ESCALATION:**


Progressive physical escalation is key. Remember, she will become sexually attracted from the inbred 'Man-To-Woman' attraction triggers within her hind-brain.

To further emphasize the power of touch, if an ugly man is laying in the bed with a hot woman, if she allows him to play with her clitoris she will get turned on and want his dick. The more she wants it, the harder it is for her to fight it. .

This is why it is important to keep on touching. I'v had girls tell me that I am too touchy... But guess what


**SHOW HER THAT YOU ARE NON-JUDGMENTAL:** 


Let me make it plain and simple. GO OUT OF YOUR WAY TO CONVEY that you are NOT going to judge her for her sexual past or present. Here's why. Women will ALWAYS ASSUME that YOU WILL JUDGE THEM even if you haven't said anything to support it.

I will often tell her a story or rant about how I hate how people judge women for their SEX life etc. I will also try to show it in my demeanor by seeming casual and free spirited about life in general. You ultimately want to convey that you are ok with whatever her past is. If she does tell you a few things

Once she feels like she won't be judged if she acts on the attraction that you've accumulated in the back of her mind... then she will be much more sexually expressive and to the point with you.

1373042872.0,1hp5w7,3 Simple Techniques That Will Improve Your Dates Immediately (Infield Date Video Included),JustinWayneDating,301,87,57,"Hey Guys

I used to struggle with dates ALL the time a few years ago. It would always crush me when I put in so much work to finally get a few dates

For those who wish to see my Live Infield Pickup &amp; Date Video: http://youtu.be/4TipN5gUaKw?t=2m41s

Here are 3 simple things that you can start implementing on your dates as soon as humanly possible.

1) Have MULTIPLE AREAS to take her to. 

One of the main reasons dates go flat is because people depend on ONE location to seduce the woman. The issue with this is that it increases the chances of the vibe going flat. If the vibe goes flat and you're still in that one location

2) Focus on Romance and NOT Sex.

I remember in the past, I focus on ROMANCE. Women value ROMANCE much higher than sex any day. Remember, even an ugly woman can sleep with a hot guy if she wants to. However, women do anything to find that special someone. I am not saying to lead her on... But Just sprinkle some romance in your interactions. If you notice in this video, I start doing things that her boyfriend should do such as wiping lint off her face etc. This will ultimately get the girl more into you and it makes sex much more likely to happen.

3) SHOW INTEREST

It is better to be interested, women love to talk about themselves. If they are a bit quiet in the beginning, give them time. Ideally, you want to be show her that you are genuinely INTERESTED in getting to know HER.

1) If you find yourself doing something just because you think it will make a girl like you or want you...stop.  Don't do it, hurting you...badly. As a matter of fact don't do **anything** with the sole purpose of earning affection.  That's called being manipulative, and it isn't being nice at all!  Having the attitude of ""What do I have to do to win their affection?"" is going to leave you alone and miserable and make others feel like they don't know who you are--which doesn't get you laid.  Doing this may lead you to think, ""Well if I don't do these things I've learned how to do, what do I say or do to people when talking to them?""  In this case...

2) If you find yourself not knowing what you should do, what would they be?  Pretend you are in a consequence-free environment.  How would you act?  If you have the inclination to be really rude or short with people (I do admittedly when I'm feeling weak or powerless), remember the want to hurt others is manipulative, too.  What you're striving for isn't to try and get emotion out of other people, but to...

3) Be completely honest with yourself.  You know what you want, it's okay to want something or someone, even if you wished you didn't.   If you want the girl admit to yourself you want her.  If you want to wear a ball gag and be spanked, admit to yourself that you do.  It's okay, seriously.  Keep away from opinions of yourself when doing this.  Only focus on more direct things like your wants and needs.  If you want to get laid by that girl at work, admit that you do.  If you look at porn for hours a day, admit to yourself, but whether you are ashamed or not it is who you are.  Once you start sorting out the inside of your head

4) Be direct with others.  You know what you want, but I can tell you now if you're a ""nice guy"" being too direct is the least of your problems; I can tell you with 100% faith you probably would be a lot happier being more direct than you are now.  This works for good as well as bad.  If you want to hang out with a girl again, don't wonder how to word it.  Just say it however it comes out.  If you want to kiss her, go for it.  On the other hand if some hot girl you want to have sex with asks you for help and you don't really want to, be direct and honest with her.  If you don't, then *don't*!  It's okay.  Don't come up with an excuse why, or say it's not your fault.  Just tell her you don't feel like it.  It seems like this is a really prick-ish thing to do but you won't be a bad person for doing it.  And crazily enough

5) (Warning, breathing girl, many guys turn to other activities to take the place their girlfriend would.  The most common is...porn!  There are other types of girlfriend replacements, but they are all just substitutions for real girls.  By looking at porn your mind is trying to recreate the feelings (horniness) that you would feel if you were with a real girl.  So whenever you go look at your favorite Gianna Michaels flick, you're in a roundabout way pretending she's your girlfriend for however long it takes you to finish.  Even if you don't look at porn your internal fantasies are girl substitutes, too.  You know that one fantasy girl you have in your head who's favorite hobbies are holding hands and anal?  Yeah, she's just a substitute for a real girl.  This doesn't seem like a problem in itself, then part of your incentive IRL is gone.  This isn't to say porn or sexual fantasies are bad, in a weird way.  I'm honestly not saying you should stop looking at porn, but I choose to date a website or my imagination instead.""  Just understand this at first

So, and when you try to act like them you come across as a tool.  Yes you can learn seduction techniques and they may even work, but I can tell you wholeheartedly that you will be much more satisfied with your life in all areas if you learn how to be yourself first. Then you can learn seduction. :-)",,False,,t5_2qhrv,,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/13lp1y/as_a_recovering_nice_guy_i_thought_id_share_the/

After a 4.5 year relationship dissolved

What did I do? I sucked it up and literally called everyone in my phone until someone could hang out. I always phrased things passively such as

After I ""got over"" my relationship, I was an amazing guy (tall college grad early, has a job, climber, in decent shape, love to cook). I started using this to my advantage. When I would meet a new girl, I would ask her questions, and maybe drop in a hobby. I didn't brag or elaborate but rather let the stereotype do it's job. It always pays to have hobbies you suck at too (for me

So much of this subreddit is devoted to picking up girls in bars. There are a large number of girls that maybe go to the bar once a month or less. I have never picked a girl up in a bar (I've tried) and am much more comfortable in different social settings. Since my big breakup 10 months ago, have gotten there with 5 other women.

I'm fit, i can talk to women after i have met them once or twice, or if i'm not into them, but i just don't know how to meet someone and just say ""hi...."" and start a conversation.


I was once like you


If this sounds like you. here is how i overcame it.

_______________________________________________________

There are a few things that i have found important on building up to talk to that attractive woman that you just cant approach.

I find there are a few things to take into perspective that many people(including myself) have overlooked.

1. They are human beings, not a strange things. just like you and I. don't think of them as women, think of them as people.

2. People, or even what happened on tv last night. remember you don't even need to talk much once you are both comfortable.

3. Girls like to meet people, or in the way that they look.
make it your duty because Heck none of the other AFC's out there will let them know.

4. They don't know you, they don't know that you may not be a good boyfriend for whatever matter. BUT DONT DONT DONT you dare make that decision for them, let them find out how much of a douche you are... sometimes girls go for the douche anyway.

Right now down to business

A majority of human conversation, but expressions, arm movement and the state that you are in, they all play a role in communication in general, and you can use them to your advantage to working up to a actual communication.

This involves the following
- State of mind
- Body posture
- Eye Contact
- Smiling
- Finally comes the talking

these are all important when approaching

**- State of mind**

~~~~
This Is important for all things in life, if you have an alpha state of mind, thus will also show. i really do like the fake it before you make it phrase as face it, you don't need to be cocky or show it, but you don't need to hide the fact that you keep fit aren't ugly and are reasonably nice and awesome.

For me every day i say look recovering_beta, in fact if i don't they won't know how good a life knowing me could be, or how much fun we can have together. they want to know me, and just don't know it yet.

Build your mind, be that alpha that doesn't put up with shit, be that alpha that is actively out there talking to women heck that's what you are, so be as awesome as you can.

“women don't want a nice guy


**- Body posture**

Simple really, nothing better than being the most dominant male in the room at the party or in town. Be the tall guy that they all want that is awesome as shit. Just do it.

**- Eye Contact**

Now here comes the scary bit, this is the one to take note at. I have heard around 70% of communication in person is dealt with different ways other than words, communications isn't just talking to them and them talking back it takes everything into account.

The thing to do here is NEVER NEVER NEVER be first to look away, they want the alpha that looks  her in the eyes, knows what he wants and isn't afraid of her, another person. Because when you look down to the pavement or look away first it shows your beta and don't want to talk to them because you are fearful. 

So as you walk around town, do not look away first, just hold it. You don’t need to be creepy, just be friendly and approachable, be in your nice “awesome” state, the state that everyone likes and wants to be around.  
In nature you often see primates and other animals don’t look in the eye to avoid contact and prevent confrontation

This is different with most human beings
So one of the steps in overcoming approach anxiety is, that you aren’t beta.


**- Smiling**

Smiling is important and goes hand in hand with Eye contact, it shows higher value, and can make someone else's day much better. 

I have seen someone driving their car with the  biggest smile on their face, and saw her happiness and in turn that was somehow transferred to me.

Smiling is used in conjunction with the rest I have made someones day just by walking past, and I had that returned to me. This is one of the easiest things to do, because you don’t even need to say anything, just walk past looking at her in the eye, and think ”wow she is pretty”.  That’s the kind of smile you want to have just like you are enjoying your day being awesome and simply noticing someone else that in turn made happy just from me smiling, its simple it works you can make them happy and make them approachable without even talking.   Think of how easy it is to talk to the cashier at the supermarket when they have a smile and look you in the eye.  Treat your life like that with everyone you meet, be positive


**- Finally comes the talking**

Talking is one of the biggest fears most people have


----STEP 1

For me I started off small, most of the time friendly, they don’t mind small talk and almost all of the time forget who you are. In super market mode they can forget you just went through the shop in 3 hours (super market anyway).  They are paid to listen to you and talk, and be friendly, so this is a Non-Threat approach. Once I felt comfortable enough talking small talk with these women/ladies. First step complete.


----STEP 2

 The second step is to talk to someone that isn’t there to give you a service or sell you something, eye contact and smile. The easiest way for me to strike up a convo is during action things, or when you are right next to each other just doing something for example, filling up a drink bottle, waiting for a bus, waiting in line for a concert or sitting at the shared computers. Anywhere two people are simply doing similar things next to each other. With this you don’t need to say the dreaded “HI.. my name is..”.
For me it was at the microwaves on campus to heat your lunch

Mentioning something about what you’re doing

You need to do this with anyone at any time, just think of something related to what you’re doing, and remember it doesn’t matter what it is, because they aren’t likely to remember you the next day unless you get their number or talk to them for more than a minute.

Once you have done this more than 10 times and are comfortable its time to move to the threatening  people.

----Step3


Now these are the ones that you may have thought are too intimidating, the ones that would never give you the time of day.

Here is where you are different, this is when you need to focus on the first 3 steps, build your state higher than ever before, be the best man/woman you can be, Eye contact, Smile. 
Talk.

Just do it, honestly make her day better by letting her get to know you, find out a bit about her show her interest.

Inner confidence is knowing that nobody will ever understand your mental state, but nobody will ever really know these things as well as you.

So don't give weight to other people when they say things that aren't positive.

Will probably get a negative reply
Don't have many of these because they are very risky.

**Fluffing** - Stuff that just fits in almost everywhere

Say this after anything sexual

1302400683.0,gmhew,"This week in AskSeddit: blanking out mid-conversation, conversation threading, and girls' stares",blackdevildisco,258,8

So glad I decided to post TWiAS this week

""This week in AskSeddit, which is where beginner and/or specific-situation questions on pickup and seduction should go.

Without further ado:

---

**#1. [It's not that I have AA

So KolHaKavod has no trouble with approaching – respect

Worth noting is that he doesn't seem to feel like he needs to eject or radically rework his approaches – like Tofu has said

And someone mentioned the awesome conversational technique I alluded to – **conversation threading**. I first read about it on seductionreview.com

Basically, just that you're using key words as jumping off points. From that article:

&gt;If you come across a woman in a shopping mall and she says “I’m just shopping around for some jeans with my friends”

&gt; 1. Shopping (“There’s this store on the second floor you’ll love…”)

&gt; 2. Jeans (“I hope you’re not one of those who goes for ripped jeans”)

&gt; 3. Her friends (“Your friends seem like a great group of girls. How do you know each other?”)

&gt; Can you see how easy it can become with some practice? You can take any of the above responses and use them to keep the conversation going.

I think naturals and pros do this automatically

So awesome

---

**#2. [First date in 2 years.](http://www.reddit.com/r/askseddit/comments/gjxvn/first_date_in_2_years/)**

HigherThanStars has the same problem as the previous guy – trouble keeping a conversation going – but there are additional complications. This first-order conversational problem creates a second-order confidence problem

I suppose one could say both of these problems are due to a deeper inner game problem

If that's right

Why am I splitting hairs here? To try to show why IMHO it probably won't work to just tell OP to relax and try to have fun. I mean

Instead, and success when he does, which in turn gives him more confidence. In the words of that article I quoted above:

&gt;If you can master this skill **it will increase your confidence when it comes to approaching** women

It's sort of like what I think I've heard Tofu (et al.?) say about Mystery Method. To paraphrase

But long-term

**#3. [What do you do when a girl gives back a stare?](http://www.reddit.com/r/askseddit/comments/ghq42/what_do_you_do_when_a_girl_gives_back_a_stare/)**

strangerdream is making confident eye contact with girls

1349902818.0,119t9y,Opinions(ego) vs. Facts [Inner Game],Live4theDrop,250,40,48,"I came to a startling realization regarding my inner-game that is often referred to as “clicking” around these parts. I figured I would share it here in the hopes that it may inspire someone else. Please keep in mind the majority of the following tome is my personal distillation of books I have read and my opinion.

The majority of humanity does not exist in reality. That is the majority of your decisions and actions are made through the haze of opinion or ego. Essentially these are short cuts hardwired into your brain through a combination of DNA, for example don’t jump off a 30 story building. Most of us have never attempted to jump unaided off a 30 story building onto solid concrete, because we intuitively know that this is not the smartest decision we could make for a long and happy life. The problem with these short cuts is they are antiquated particularly in a social sense. Also a big majority of input for your ego (your life experiences) is purely happenstance the environment you were raised in, location of birth etc. you could go on for hours. An even bigger problem is that they compound on themselves as you make decisions based on these opinions. Pretty soon your brain has convinced itself that you have as much chance of getting a date with statuesque blonde at the bar or becoming a CEO of your own company as you do of surviving that nose dive off your office tower. Here are some real world examples of your ego/opinion coloring your observations.

     
* Wow that guy parked in the handicapped spot without a sticker he must be the world’s greatest douche-nozzle: **OPINION**   
* Wow that guy parked in the handicapped spot without a sticker there must be some sort of emergency: **OPINION**    
* There is a guy parked in a handicapped spot without a sticker:**FACT**
    
___________________________________________________

* That girl is 5 inches taller than me and absolutely stunning she would have absolutely no interest in me:**OPINION**
* That girl is 5 inches taller than me: **FACT**
  
___________________________________________________________
  
* That girl just rejected me she must be like all the rest of these worthless bitches: **OPINION**     
* That girl just rejected me I knew I could never measure up to a girl like that: **OPINION**  
* That girl at the present moment in time has rejected my approach: **FACT**
  
Most people’s first reaction upon accepting these statements is “DESTROY ALL THE EGOS” however this is not possible or necessarily healthy again it is your ego at work

* I have an ego and it is making horribly negative decisions for me: **OPINION**
* I have an ego: **FACT**

None of the people browsing seddit would be here if weren’t for our egos. The ego is responsible for most of humanities successes and advances in the same breath it is responsible for most of its short comings. What to do? It is incredibly difficult the ego is probably the single most manipulative bit of programming that exists in our brain. There is a vast difference between making an opinionated decision and a conscious opinionated decision. Become aware of how your ego is impacting your decisions and its negative powers disappear. The next time you decide not to approach, take your relationship to the next level, tell that friend how you really feel, or react to any of the above ask yourself “am I considering the facts?”

Every week, and tidbits from posts on seddit is posted that week by the users of seddit. It'll have the same name every week, and will be made on a specific day. This way, it's possible to look to the past of seddit much easily and find information. All you have to do is search, ""Weekly thread"" and you'll find a repository of all the good little tidbits and tips from that week. It's very similar to the weekly simple questions thread on many subreddit.

Weekly tl;dr 4/13/2012

tl;dr of what was learned: whatever subject you guys are talking about, or cop and potentially ""bad"" person. This will work well to segue into a sexual convo and get her turned on by the use of innuendo and sexual role play. It's harmless, fun, and very simple.

FR example:

&gt;Getting Sexual

&gt;""I'm an architectural designer

&gt;""Is that the same thing as an architect?"" I ask.

&gt;""It is. But I don't have my license. So legally I can't say I'm an architect.""

&gt;""Actually..."" I say. ""I'm the architectural police and I came here to check to make sure that you would honestly say that. So. congratulations. You passed. I'm not going to arrest you.""

&gt;She's laughing hard now. ""Fantastic

&gt;""Really?"" I say.

&gt;""I think so

&gt;""Why would I let you get away with it? Are you pretty convincing? Do you have ways of convincing me not to arrest you?""

&gt;""I don't know

&gt;Both of us are feeling this amazing sexual tension.

I asked a girl standing next to me if she knew the song/artist.

She said ""Ofcourse! It is &lt;so and so song by so and so artist&gt;. You don't know this?""

I said ""No!""
And we got to talking. We transitioned from topic to topic very easily. She was genuinely friendly.

We got to talking about beers as she was drinking some beer and I asked her opinion on the beer that I should try at this bar. So we headed towards the counter and stood behind someone as it was kinda crowded. Out of nowhere

""Hey! No touching!"" the huge guy said sternly!

I was completely caught off-guard to this turn of events and all my senses went numb. I didn't know what to say!

I mumbled a 'Hi' thinking he was her boyfriend.

She interjected ""Hey this is my friend Jason"" or whatever his name was. He had his eyes fixed on me as if he was going to eat me raw. The girl on the other hand was very very embarrassed.

She nudged him to the side as I made my way to the bar and bought the beer she had suggested. I saw her arguing with him.

A little while later we bumped into each other and I told her that I liked the beer.

""Your friend is very possessive. I am scared of him and so I am going to stay away from you"" I put my hand on her shoulder and moved myself backward instead of pushing her away. I learnt this trick from the youtube ""how to kino"".

She was very flustered and said ""I am really really sorry about him"". She brought over a friend to convince me that the guy was harmless. I still walked away

What I interpreted from this situation was that guy was obviously an orbiter, he just ended up embarrassing her and fell down even more in her eyes.

1367519805.0,1dkenp,[FR] A Tale of Two Dates. Two Sides of A Coin.,liquidxtension,255,45,22,"Hi guys

This is resident moderator liquidxtension from [/r/gothamseddit](www.reddit.com/r/gothamseddit). We've got a great growing community going on here and if you're a New Yorker looking for some amazing people help build your social skills with

The following is a FR that I wrote yesterday and I thought it would be beneficial to share it with the rest of seddit community. You're feedback is welcome. I always feel like there is something new to learn.

Cheers.

I'd like to keep these two FRs short and to the point and discuss what I've learned from my experiences.

**Date 1**

After an amazing night with another date on Friday night, and I felt like I had this one in the bag.

Sunday comes by and out of nowhere I had a random call from my coworkers/supers to see if I'd be willing to help out with something related to work in the city. Since I was going to be in there in the city

The whole time the date was my secondary priority. I just felt like it would go like any other last 3 successful dates I've had. Each date I've progressively pushed myself for more and I've been seeing results. 

We eventually meet up near Solas and when I saw her..she looked gorgeous. I didn't immediately realize

Soon as we started talking, sports fiend, film enthusiast....she was dealing all the cards of what I would consider a girl I'd totally date exclusively and I didn't know how to handle it. I slowly regressed out of state.

The most irritating part of it all? I knew it was going downhill. I saw she was losing my attention, the person who would not go for something what he wants, but hopes it would come to him.

The night was nice and relaxing

Next day

***What I learned***
Calibrate yourself at all times and do not lose yourself. If you realize something is going wrong, I fell into a pit of infatuation and let her get the best of me.

""Experience is simply the name we give our mistakes.""-Oscar Wilde

**Date 2**

I've been trying to set up a date with a person I #closed for awhile. After a bit of patience

I had the experience from Sunday on my belt and kept it in the back of my head as a reminder of what not to be doing. I also had all the experiences from my other dates to remind me what I did right.

I meet her at the bar and I was immediately was faced with a problem. No seats at the bar or tables. Fuck.

But I stayed calm

By now, said we're going on an adventure and we're going to look for 230 5th, which was nearby. Unfortunately, I couldn't find it anywhere....

I look at her and say

She laughs and then I immediately ask her to tell me one of the worst dates she's ever had. It keeps us both entertained while I slowly calculate what to do.

In the end, and wait until one opens up. She agreed and we headed back, and coincidentally, we did get seats.

The thing is

We grab a few drinks and have some great convo, keeping things fun. Whenever I got the chance, I lightly grab her hands and play with them or squeeze them when I can. 

Eventually

As we were standing on a corner of a street

Afterwards we walked together down to Lillie's and it was pretty packed as well, keeping my hands around her legs, have my hands wrapped around her arms. I go in for another kiss after another solid conversation. More solid make outs. 

It was then when I realized she was extremely turned on. She started whispering

She eventually told me I'm a really good kisser, I had a date tell me I'm a terrible kisser.). 

As we walked out of the bar I went in for another close and she couldn't resist. For the next 30 mins or so we hit hard

Eventually I walk her back to the dorm. We have another quick makeout session and contemplate whether she should bring me back up to her dorm. She makes an excuse her room mates are sleeping by now and that she doesn't do this on first dates. 

Some of you will disagree and say I should've pushed further

I end it with one final makeout she tells me

Fin.

http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/jpjiy/first_post_on_seddit_intro_and_my_field_report/ .  

I was always scared to view women as sexual beings and be okay with the fact that I am also a sexual being.  My goal was to have a girlfriend by Christmas, opening 300+ sets, many number closes, and day 2's, I have succeeded!  I found a girl who is beautiful on the outside and inside.  She's not the only cool girl out there, but she's definitely one of them.  Women are such wonderful, beautiful creatures.

I didn't start learning game to get laid like a rockstar.  **I just want to find the love of my life and live happily ever after.**  However, that I have the skills to go out and meet tonnes of new people is such stress-relief.  Ironically, it's what keeps this girl attracted to me.

Here are a couple things I've done to change myself.  **This is not keyboard jockey crap**.  This is all from my own personal experience in the field.  These might not work for you

* **Honesty**:  I don't like lying or deception one bit.  I decided that I was tired of trying to act like someone else to try to get attention.  I didn't want to put up a front for anyone, mother, or lover.  One of the best things I did was have a frank conversation with my mother about our different values: http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/jykl3/what_to_do_when_your_values_are_incompatible_with/ .  Release your fronts.  It feels great to admit when you are sad, happy, angry, frustrated, etc.  Do this and women will do the rest as far as forming an emotional connection with you.  They're so good at that.

* **Setting Goals**:  Realize that your number one goal as dictated by nature is to survive and reproduce, education, etc.).  Make getting good with women a priority, because it's important for being a man.  Make sure you don't give up your life for the sake of women.  You need to love yourself first and do what makes you happy.

* **Genuine Self-content**: I am 100% happy being single, but I don't need her to be happy.  Knowing that a date or relationship not working out will leave you back in a state of 100% happiness is much more awesome than worrying that someone might leave you or not be interested in you and you becoming AFC pitiful because of it.

* **Always being in state**:  http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/lui5z/getting_into_state_two_kinds_of_approaches/

* **Outcome independence**: Never expect anything, having sex with you, etc.  If you are fine regardless of the outcome of your interaction, then you will protect yourself from disappointment and open the gates to the world to rinse, repeat, and improve your game.  Edit: Remember to keep abundance mentality!  It doesn't matter if you mess up or if a girl isn't into you or if a girl is already taken.  There are plenty of awesome women out there.

* **Self-amusement**: People, make them smile and laugh, because you find it fun and funny to do so, not because you want to make them smile and laugh.

* **Be a giver**:  Creeps are people who want to take something sexually from women.  Manly men give women the pleasure of being sexually attracted to them.  Don't just talk to single girls.  Talk to everyone, married couples, bartenders, waitstaff, janitors, etc.  Make everyone's day better off.

* **APPROACH**:  Nobody is going to do this for you.  You have to approach if you want to get anywhere.  My game is natural, and a little sloppy, but 100% me.  I open people by having good body language, not approaching directly head-on, smiling (eyes are important) and saying ""Hi!""  Then I ask a question: How's you're night going?  Then I answer my own question, explaining to people what I'm doing.  One time I even explained that I had a really stressful day and just came by myself, because I wanted a drink (truth).  If they're not receptive, until they crack.  Sometimes they don't and I'll say, don't forget that you can game and approach while doing errands

* **The process**:  Girls want the process of attraction.  Give it to them.  They know you want them naked, touching them, asking for their number, kissing them, and getting them to a sex location.  Unless they say otherwise, they are enjoying the ride.

* **Physical game**: This is probably half of seduction and one that is often overlooked.  Being in shape helps.  Good body language is very important.  Dancing is fun.  Leading through body language is important.  Knowing how, fun, and friendly.  I personally like to touch while I'm at dramatic points of a story or at the punch line of a joke.  If she's smiling, and you touch her, and she's still smiling, you're doing something right.  Kino out of context is really creepy.  Vin Di Carlo's escalation ladder is really useful.

I might not agree with everything in here, knowledge, and actionable items that would bring them closer and closer to their goals; be they to have a ONS, or to maintain a great LTR/marriage (a LTR is a continued seduction).

For those who don't know me yet, I know. And I've been reading PUA'Seduction for over 10 years now, and I can attest that it works!  

Having said that

If you go out to clubs on Saturday Night
You are not professing or stating that you only seek ONS, at some point in time he's going to score a gf or FWB of some sort, and most of the time this girl will be free on Saturday Night, prime time for having fun.

Sure he could pull it off some excuse to not see her

Sure, or if it's desirable/feasible.

So, the PUA goes out, again, looking for more girls.  And he's successful, he now dates 2 women.  Without going into the logistics details, one gets Saturday Night, and the other one gest Sunday Night.

I don't know about you, we hang out at least one more day during the week.  So, 2 girls = 4 nights/week.

And, and you should too.

And this is where I start to get really puzzled

* I live near a Major US city, let's face it, there are only a handful of cool venues where the beautiful people go, and where I like.  If I am already dating 2 women.... someone knows someone, the risk for disaster is too high.

* Traveling miles and miles.. what for?  I have (in this case) 2 girlfriends already

* Budget.  If I am going out 4 nights a week with the girls that I am dating AND I still go out for some more *game* another couple of nights, on my health (too much drinking) and to my sleeping patterns)

This is what I practice

* use /r/seduction as a way to be or become a *Confident Modern Male*

* have a social life.  Which means a large circle of friends

* be social: which means do activities that interest you and your friends

* being a *Confident Modern Male* people will be attracted to you. A subset of them will be eligible females that you will be attracted to as well

* get yourself a girlfriend

* still continue to be a *Confident Modern Male*

* still continue to be social

* therefore other women will be attracted to you

- multiple girlfriends, 4+.. if you are able to, please do post!

- constantly upgrading girlfriend, out with the old, and welcome the new

- have a somewhat steady girlfriend

- any variation

So I created this simple study to measure how effective each is. Below is the outline for my study. I apologize if it sounds overly ""sciency""; My background is in technical writing so that is just how I write. Let me know what you think

**Study question**: What are the factors that influence return text time (RTT) in American female young adults?

**Background and Hypothesis**: The appearance of aloofness is highly sought after in heterosexual intergender social relationships. Attentiveness and eagerness is meta-perceived as overly attached, are only interested in sex. This might very well be true and the impression may be positively reinforced if she has already initiated or accepted sexual advances with the man in question. Nevertheless, young females are typically willing to give their personal phone number to a soliciting male for several plausible reasons: 1) interest in initiating another interaction (sexual or non-sexual); 2) a perceived obligation to please the man, or; 3) the desire to expand her social network, something strongly encouraged by the culture. 

As it is not typical for young women to initiate a second interaction for the aforementioned socio-cultural reasons, 2) quality of former interaction(s) with the suitor; 3) initial and present impressions of the suitor as a viable sexual partner. 

**Methodology**: The relative contributions of the three proposed variables to RTT can be parsed and assessed by controlling for two and gauging the deviation of third from some predetermined average text message response time for the population, this would require an average response time to be calculated. Although there are a variety of confounding variables, a large data set will generate a robust population statistic from which deviations can be measured. The variables tested are inherently subjective which makes them less amenable to controlled experimentation; however, the former can be standardized more readily than the latter two. I propose to construct a protocol to assess variable (1) as an independent variable for RTT. 

The results must be interpreted in light of the other important variables mentioned as well as other lesser important, “I enjoyed hanging out with you. We should do it again soon”; 3) late week or weekend “I enjoyed hanging out with you. We should do it again soon”; 4) mid week, “Heyy sexy! whats goin on??; 5) late week or weekend, “Heyy sexy you should come party w me”; 6) mid week, “Hey, can I ask you a question?”. 

Sub-variables 1-1 through 1-3 measure the efficacy of a text message that is not sexually suggestive with an element of intertemporal variation. Text messages should be sent at approximately the same time at the three points during the week to control for sub-intertemporal variation: arbitrarily, if the woman responds, she was pleased with her former interaction with the suitor and is interested in reinitiating a dialogue. 

Measurement of RTT will be initiated when the text message is sent. After 24 hours with no response

My last submition [""How I Rebuilt Myself""](http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/k7y2h/how_i_rebuilt_myself/) got positive feedback, so if you like this, that might also be helpful.

The following is rarely talked about because it is hard to define

Symptoms
--------
*****
* You know pickup material
* You can open like a boss
* You get numbers
* You don't know whether to invite a girl alone or to hang with bunch of friends
* You need to clarify whether a day2 is a date or ""just hanging out""
* You come here not knowing what to text or say to a girl

To clarify

The Problem
-----------
*****
Guys have a ""worldview"" before pickup that they hold onto once learning PUA techniques. Things like: *""I don't often meet new women"", especially ""indirect game"" which compounds the problem by telling the reader to avoid showing interest in the woman.

The big problem comes when they try to change to a ""We are going to sleep together / date"" worldview


####First impressions:
Women start building an image of who you are, then everything is much easier as they already start imagining you together.

My next post will be ""Thinking like a Woman""

The Solution
------------
*****
You need to adopt a PUA worldview (examples below) from the start

* I often meet women
* It is common to meet people and meet alone at a later date
* I am highly valuable and women fight for my time

You need to make it clear from the start that you know and let her know where the relationship is heading. You guide the entire process

####Indirect Game
You don't need to let her know that you are interested in **her**

Techniques
----------
*****
So how do we project this worldview?

###In conversation

* Getting her relationship status early on
* Guide conversation to relationships / sex / personal relationship histories
* Make comments implying you two will hookup, etc (all semi-joking)
* Disqualify yourself from relationships which indirectly implies still hooking up
* Stories about girls you've hooked up with

Make it clear from the outset where you think this interaction is heading. Tons of standard material apply.

###Sub-communication

* Kino (this is huge
* Not accepting any frames that don't lead to you hooking up with her

I could go into an entire post about frames, ""I don't hook up with strangers""*, then you don't accept those. That means being unreactive, treating it like she was joking, changing subject like you didn't hear it, or actually calling her out on what she said rather than let it slide. 

###Timebridging (proper #-close)
Handle every detail:

* When / How you are going to get in contact with her
* What you two will be doing together (Paint an image for her)
* What you expect and she should expect from the day2 (more than friendly conversation)
* Where the relationship is headed (above
* Get her to confirm with enthusiasm your day2 plans

This is huge, and she better answer within 2 rings and say *""WOW curveball I am so happy to hear from you!""*. Tell her you are going to get icecream, talk about the fun conversation you will have and what will happen afterwards. Have her imagine walking with your arm around her licking icecream cones together, getting some on your nose, etc. Get her to agree to it! If she isn't 100% committed then tell her the plans are off.

***Secret Tip:*** Ask her if she *thinks* she would go out with you if you asked her on a date, because they'd have to re-evaluate their own choices. This can boost your date rate **immensely.**

####What if I don't have time or haven't isolated?

difference in my attitude and results",31,48,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/h6x0h/some_basic_tips_ive_realized_that_have_made_all/,"1. For the love of god, look people in the eyes and smile. I know this is pickup 101 here, i know you've read it a million times before. I know you are thinking ""well no shit, they IMMEDIATELY become so much less intimidating

2. Once you've got eye contact down, their movements, their clothing, any accessories, their hair or whatever. Examine everything, comment on it, joke or tease about it, this is amazing for generating some comfort building conversation as well as some light teasing. If you just observe the person it gives the conversation so many directions to go. It can also be great for putting you in the mindset that YOU are the one judging HER

3. I'm not sure how everybody here will feel about this one

4. Remember, right? Wrong. A lot of us came here initially because girls were just the opposite. They were intimidating. Stop taking everything about the opposite sex so seriously, girls are adorable and it's fun to see how they'll react, so enjoy it and laugh it off. Have fun.

5. PICKUP IS NOT A LIFESTYLE, and no matter how much progress we made it was never enough. Lifestyle changes like the ones promoted here take baby steps, sometimes very intimidating baby steps but do not push yourself to do too much at once. It's not necessary. It's OK to take baby steps.

Imagine for a moment that you go out with a good friend every saturday, but once you step off that court you go back to your everyday life. You don't let the basketball game bleed into and taint every other area of your life. It's just a hobby. Pickup should be the same thing. don't let the outcome of your sets affect the rest of your life, your actions or self-esteem. Once you leave a set, you're back in everyday life and the two have no reason to intersect. So stop looking at picking up women as a detrimental part of your lifestyle, it only matters when you're in set, once you leave a set you go back to your life. I'd be happy to expand on this if i was no clear enough.

6. This is the most important one so I wanted to put it last. The reason I put this after number 5 is because it ties into it. For the longest time I though I wanted my lifestyle to be pickup. This is the worst way to go.

YOU CANNOT BE PROUD OF YOURSELF, not mentally. Do you dress the way you want? Do you actually do the hobbies you like? Imagine your BEST self, the way you see it. What does he do? Are you doing that? Get out, go to the gym, get a job, surf, play guitar, dress whatever way you think is cool and fucking WEAR those clothes, it doesn't matter. Just start building your idea of a lifestyle you would be proud of and don't wait

I know this is a relatively vague peice of advice, and effective.

EDIT: Something small I wanted to add. Remember that everybody is a pickup artists friend. Don't be afraid to talk comfortably with everybody you meet. Talk to them the way you'd talk to an old friend. Don't be uptight. Don't be afraid to be goofy.

1343178224.0,x3swf,I’m Eric Disco. I help nice guys get past their fear of approaching women. AMA,EricDisco,285,83,165,"It seems like one of the simplest things. You're out getting a cup of coffee and you see her at the coffee shop. She's gorgeous. You're really attracted to her. So why not say hi? Strike up a conversation. If it doesn't go well

Guys these days are in a difficult position. We're expected to make the first move to talk with her, etc. At the same time, it seems completely unacceptable to hit on women and get sexual with them. A guy who is too bold and overt with his sexual interest in women is shamed and laughed at as a douchebag. Nobody wants to be ""that guy.""

As guys we're expected to suppress our emotions, paralyzing fear that grips you to the core. 

The first time we do it, and we never want to again. So our natural instinct is avoidance. We stop trying to approach women. We stop improving ourselves socially. We become passive and hope one day the stars will align and that amazing woman will fall into our arms. We think that if we keep working on whatever else is passionate to us, she'll come along. 

When I first moved to New York City, but no one could tell me how to get past that fear. No one could tell me how to deal with this overwhelming paralysis or the self-torture that came with inevitable rejection. I was in uncharted emotional territory.

That's why I started, and eventually coaching other guys to do it. Since then, I've had millions of readers and coached hundreds of guys.

I recently finished my first book, measured steps to get past their fear. A few key points:

* **It's not your fault.** The thoughts and feelings that arise when you try to take initiative are automatic and involuntary. You can't decide not to feel them. You can't get rid of them by thinking something in your mind. Stop trying. The only thing you can do is take small

* **Trying to ""get this over with"" doesn't work.** Neither does setting yourself up to talk with ten women every day, standing next to women, saying something and walking away, you get your body comfortable with the uncertainty of social interactions.
 
* **There are fears and inhibitions at every stage.** Even if you can say something to a woman and walk away, or being sexual with her. Instead, we can break 'the approach' down into smaller initiatives. You can practice each initiative and get comfortable with it before moving onto the next. Eventually you are able to do the whole thing: successfully start conversations with attractive women you don't know.

Guess what guys? The perfect girl is *never* going to come along. Not fairytale, yes, yes, try to push yourself into new boundaries and find new challenges &amp; more beautiful women to make your life great. Yes, try to improve yourself in social interactions, and yes, **try to find a girl that makes you happy.** Who cares about anyone else's picture of your #1 girl?

But once you find a girl that makes you truly, and she wants a monogamous relationship? Game *her*. **You can keep your aloofness, keep your alpha male status, keep your outcome independence. Hell, keep your openers &amp; negs for that matter. These are just *social skills* that have been given a name.** Everyone who is on /r/seduction - or any other forum to do with seduction, for that matter - is just learning social skills. You are trying to take your social skills to the next level. Keep these social skills for everyone in your life. But don't look for K-closes or F-closes any more. Keep the #-closes. These people are now your friends. 

Funny thing I realized about social skills about a month ago - you don't learn them by reading about them. Once you've read enough, outside Reddit, outside the internet, outside books. The only people that can teach you how to be *true* masters of seduction are those who have mastered it without overthinking it** - people like Johnny Depp, Brad Pitt, etc etc. Fuck, even Adrien Brody. That dude is not naturally blessed in the looks department

Don't look to be like those guys, but always has something good to say. If you're a musician, develop your rockstar attitude. If you play sports... You're probably not here. Something about people who play sports just gets them laid. Don't say ""oh that's cause they play sports"".. fuck no. Sports taught them what they know about seduction. If you're someone who plays sports and is bad at picking up women, don't lose hope. It'll probably even be easier for you to learn what you're missing. Programming doesn't teach you shit about women. The point of any seduction forum is to help *you* find your own unique brand of self-confidence. If you're a programmer now, figure out what you need to learn to fill the gaps that a lack of sports created. This is just an example; this doesn't mean you have to stop being a programmer -

This means you have to **look at all the things that are wrong with you, what you're self-conscious about. And why. And then find out why someone who *isn't* worried about those things *doesn't* worry. Steal their attitude and use it as you please.

I used to be self-conscious about money (I grew up poor), he's not an enemy. Fuck. He's a great guy to have around. Make friends with *him*, and you'll get more girls. You guys are gonna call it ""raising your social value"", but nah. **If a dude gets laid a lot, he's gonna teach you how to get laid just from letting you watch how he works. None of this is an act. Find out who you are, and project it. He's not acting.** 

[side note: don't ask him deep ""pickup"" questions about how he does it. That's weird, he will. If he doesn't, just keep watching. Don't keep bugging him and nerding out about it. If he knows how to do it but can't explain it, it's always been easy to him. You've gotta learn to act like it's always been easy, so absorb that from him. But don't try to be him; apply it to your personality. **This is too complicated to explain. Just go out and do it.**]

So if you're worried about one-itis (by monogamous relationship) or settling for too little in a girl, make her happy. If you get out of a happy relationship for no reason other than the perceived ""one-itis"", you'll just spend the next while looking for the girl that she was. Don't say this is a lack of abundance - I know that I could go out on the subway and talk to ten girls and have a few numbers, maybe take one to bed. It's not about whether or not I *can* do something else - I know I can - it's about knowing what makes you happy and sticking with it. On the flipside, if you're unhappy that you *don't* have a girl, you have one-itis. Realize that once you're in a happy relationship (for both parties), one-itis doesn't exist. 

Most people in the community forget this. They miss the game



**tl;dr: This is too complicated to explain. Just go out and do it. Learn by watching the guys who are good, and testing what works for you.**

After being stuck in this loop for 20-30 minutes

I asked an HB7 to dance, but I was happy enough at having worked up the courage to ask that girl to dance. 

I returned to the party and found a HB6, who claims she has a boyfriend. No worries, I'm at 3/5. It was becoming a game to me. My goal was not ""fuck a HB10."" Baby steps... my goal was instead ""just make some attempts."" Every rejection only came after a success of having asked in the first place. That's two steps forward and one step back in my book. A net gain. 

Finally, and she says sure. Immediately she was into me, holding my hands while grinding, a clear IOI since most girls just keep them at their hands at their sides. As we're getting our groove on, I twirled her in toward me and went for the kiss. We made out for a while and kept dancing. Eventually I asked her to come back to my place, but she said all of her friends were still at the party and that maybe she would later. I made sure to dance so her back is toward her friend group so she stops looking over at them/ telepathically communicating.

Throughout, this time she noticed most of her fiends had gone and one of them was also dancing with a guy, so she was ready. I took her back to my room and got to second base (I feel like a high schooler saying that). I obviously would have liked to go farther with her but going from pacing the floor like an anxiety-ridden lunatic to having a topless girl licking my abs is a major improvement.

Initially I was mildly intimidated by the prospect of going to a bar with the intent of meeting women when my friends had such a clear advantage

When we got there, and one of my buddies who is a bit of a player was giving me a bit of coaching - ""Just make eye contact, be friendly..."" etc. Which actually heightened my anxiety a bit.

We were standing in line at the bar, and that's when it hit me: these are just people.

Taking in the bar scene as a whole can be overwhelming

As we're standing in line a HB9 cuts in front of me. I looked at my buddy and he just gave me a ""oh well"" look.

""Excuse me

""Yeah. I did. What are you going to do about it?"" she asked

""Nothing as long as you buy me a drink."" 

They had jars of beer going for $5.

""If you buy me a jar of PBR we'll call it even

""I'm buying myself one.""

""Bullshit

She smiled


From that moment on I realized that all it took to stand out is to be a bit ballsier than anyone else. And I learned that any woman is approachable.

I was approaching 4 sets of women with ease. I didn't worry about the outcome or their opinion.

There's no F-close or K-close to this story, carried multiple conversations with incredibly attractive women, and most importantly went about my day today with a new outlook on life. Women respect a man who exhibits guts and will talk to them, and very few of them are as cruel and snobby as our fears lead us to believe. This realization helped me to talk to several girls around town today. Good stuff.

**Indicators of Interest and Disinterest** 

When women are interested or disinterested

***Active IOI Examples***

* She re-initiates conversations when you stop talking (So….)
* She giggles and/or laughs at your jokes
* She touches you
* She tries to get rapport and build comfort with you
* If eye contact happens from a distance
* She holds eye contact for longer periods of time when she speaks with you
* She smiles at you
* While walking by
* She uses a functional opener on you or in any way initiates a conversation
* She interrupts your conversation from nearby or laughs at something you said
* She asks for personal details about you (name
* She compliments you
* She is playful and tries to challenge you
* She's punching your arm but laughing
* She plays with her hair while talking to you
* She mentions your girlfriend without knowing if you actually have one
* When she has to go to the bathroom
* She avoids mentioning her boyfriend
* When she says or does something
* She looks at you from the side
* She introduces you to friends
* She buys you a drink
* She calls you a player or a heart-breaker
* On her way out
* On your way out
* She invents reasons to be near you
* She pushes up her breasts (sexual escalation)

***Passive IOI Examples***

* She stands nearby (proximity)
* Her friends leave and she stays
* She moves to see you and hangs with you for extended periods
* If you move she follows you or waits for you
* She doesn't flinch or pull back if you get close
* When your bodies touch in some way she doesn’t break the contact
* She doesn't resist when you escalate physically (or she gives token resistance to avoid feeling like a slut)


***The most important IOIs to look for are:***

* She giggles
* She touches you
* She re-initiates conversation when you stop talking

A special kind of IOI is an ***Approach Invitation***


***Typical IODs***

* Distance
* Closed body language (crossed arms)
* Not facing you
* Lack of interest in a topic; not investing
* Walking away
* Telling you to leave

When receiving IODs it’s important to mirror body language and give an equal or slightly less investment level yourself so avoid appearing needy until she begins to invest first.

In Phoenix, also a good friend of mine. Last Saturday we went out to celebrate one of her friend's birthday. We drive over to the birthday girl's house to get the night started. Lets just say that hot girls like to make friends with other hot girls. 

We arrive and it's a chill little two bedroom place with about 8 peeps. Birthday girl is married to husband dude. He's a really cool dude, just gonna have fun hanging with them tonight. I'm not the type of guy that dances in the *breaking-up-relationships* octagon. (Though I loved this [Audi](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ANhmS6QLd5Q&amp;feature=player_embedded) commercial.) 

We then hit up the bars and more lovely ladies join us, but rather than dive into specifics about each time and guy was put down very politely and moved on, there were two guys that well... didn't.

I'm chatting with one of the girl's husband just stort of standing behind the group of girls who were all buying each other drinks for the birthday gal and the next guy comes up. Oh god does the poor guy do it all wrong. 

The first guy comes up and starts Kino immediately with the B-day girl

These two guys were starting immediately with Kino, and came off as threatening. They were trying to physically move the girls one spot of the bar to the within the first few seconds of them all meeting. I couldn't hear what they were saying, but they were trying wedge their way into the group. One guy put his arm around another girl, and she was trying to remove his hand from around her waste. I see this then me and the husband are about to step in but then my long time HB9.5 friend comes in a just destroys both of the guys. 

She shoves both of them back. ""You need to fucking leave, ""I'm not fucking around..."" rather than backing off, the guy pushed and attempted to put his arm around her waist. Again. Well.. 

There goes the drink. 

At this point

Afterward, he was a fucking asshole."" too which I replied ""Yeah, he got your drink too."" That lighten the mood. She went to get another drink. 

As she was

""He was just rude
And another: 
""He said I have money... I don't fucking care if you have money"" 

**TL:DR**

So gentleman. Know how to acquire the knowledge of who's dating who

Another example, this is after I had made friends with at least 15 new girls over the last hour, so I know Im likeable). I turn to her and respond with something like, ""Oh im sorry if I have seem to given you the wrong vibe...

1301176673.0,gc5q4,[FR] Making HB9 My Girlfriend For 12 Hours (The Power of Persistence and Other goodies). My Last FR Ever?,Delightful_White,252,50,57,"Hey Seddit. Long time no see. I’ve been avoiding the PUA scene for a while and running a more natural game. I’ve been on theory overload and I’m trying to drop all that shit. I know what works for me and what doesn’t

With that said, comfort, text game, confidence, and frame control. It’s long, but chock full of good information. Grab a beer and a snack, sit back

My wingman (a total natural) and I picked up two girls at a bar the other night. My target was a hot little brunette. She was a very short girl, tight ass. This girl couldn’t have weighed more than 105 lbs. She was a solid 9 and maybe even one of the hottest girls I’ve hooked up with. She didn’t look like a slut either, or at least she didn’t dress like one. Her friend was… meh. That’s what wingmen are for.

I opened the set by playfully accusing HB9 of stealing my seat at the bar. After playfully arguing about whose seat it really is

We end up hanging out with them for a while playing beer pong and chatting. At one point HB9 mentions how small and light she is

We offer to take the girls back to my wingman’s apartment to go drink some beers on the roof and look at the city skyline (bitches love city skylines). Just a friendly invitation. “We’re going to Wingman’s place to drink a couple beers on the roof and check out the skyline. You guys can join us if you’d like.” You need to frame these things as if you were going anyway (which we were)

During the walk my target stops on the sidewalk and is getting second thoughts about coming. “I think I want to go back to the hotel”, but I refuse to fall into her frame. I turn around and tell her “you don’t have to come if you don’t want to” and continue walking with my wingman and the other girl. She yells back at me “Why are you being an asshole?” I’m smarter than that, and I know this is a huge shit test. I turn around and walk back to her and say “I’m not being an asshole. I want to have some fun on my buddy’s roof, and if you don’t want to come that’s totally cool. Nobody is forcing you. But it’s cold out here so lets go” while I put my arm out for her. She locks her arm around mine, and we walk arm in arm to the apartment. Winning.

This is important. You have to show the girl you’re willing to walk away. And I really was. I reinforced the frame that I’m out to have a good time

Up on the roof, almost like she’s using me as a jacket. We’re talking quietly, and whenever I say something to her I put my lips right up to her ears and so they “accidentally” touch. She asks me “Why don’t you have a girlfriend? You can have any girl you want”. I explain to her that while I can get any girl I want (if she passes you the ball on that one, you gotta run with it), I don’t need a girlfriend. 2 years ago I broke up with my girlfriend of 4 years, so I’m in no rush to hop into another relationship. I’m focusing on my new career, and although I’m not opposed to having a girlfriend (if a good one comes along) I can’t really be tied down to one girl at this point because I can’t commit. She agrees with me. We were being honest with each other and opening up a little bit about our personal lives. This is what you Mystery Method-ers would call the Comfort Stage.

My wingman and his girl eventually bounce into his room

Music is a great way to bond with somebody. While browsing through the different artists we’re commenting on whether or not we hate them or love them. If I say I love a certain artist and she says she hates it, just some more token resistance. So I pick her up again and throw her on the couch. I jump on top of her and play fight some more.

It’s now about 4:00 in the morning

It’s all about persistence here. Chumps get all butthurt about getting denied a kiss. Like it’s the end of the world if she doesn’t kiss you back. OH THE HUMANITY!! Fuck that

We hooked up for a little bit

**Thursday Text Game:**

Me: We’re still on for tonight

Her: I don’t know. I think me and [friend] are going to call it an early night. We have to travel tomorrow.

Me: Don’t be such a wet blanket. I’ll have you back before your curfew.

**PERSISTENCE!**

Her: I’m so tired.

Me: Haha you wimp. I find it adorable that you can’t handle the city.

Her: Says the guy who isn’t [doing her work things].

Me: All that work must make you thirsty. For 1 drink.

**PERSISTENCE!**

Her: You’re awfully pushy. OK. Me and [friend] will meet you for one drink. Where and what time?

Me: I’m persistent. Pushy is such an ugly word. [Bar] at 9pm.

**PERSISTENCE PAYS OFF**

I called up my wingman and he wasn’t up for it. I had to convince him to meet us there and he eventually agreed to help me out. This dude is the greatest wingman of all time.

On my way there, so I head over and take a seat across from them. Not optimal positioning, but I work with it and include both girls in on the conversation while we wait for my wingman. When the friend gets up to go to the bathroom, I take that as my opportunity to sit next to HB9 and start escalating physically.

When he finally shows up, I’ll help!”

Again

We bring the shots back to the table and the party begins. We’re laughing having a good time, and I got my arm around an amazing girl. I lift my glass to my wingman and he lifts his to me. We laugh. Life is good. (so much for “1 drink”)

 I'm in my early 40's, very little experience with pickup, etc. 

Last Friday night I stopped by a local dive that has good blues . Walked in and saw it was more folks my age than college age. Don't get me wrong, but it's just easier for me to pull a woman my age, and I wasn't in the mood for a lot of work. 

There were a few decent targets around, or I may have just frozen and not even tried. Instead I thought ""Fuck that. Go for it right now"" and did not allow myself to hesitate. 

Nothing dramatic to report, I think you're having too much fun and the barstaff will cut you off"". She laughed, said she'd rather be dancing, so I took her hand and led her to the dancefloor. Instant obvious attraction on her part.  Several dances later I got her number, the suggested my place. She was ready to go. Effortless F-close, and she’s happy to come over any time I call now. 

I learned the following from seddit and applied: 
-Just approach already, and within 5 minutes of meeting me knew she would go home with me if I asked her to. This was no barfly: she was on a rare night out after a LTR breakup. 
-Having an opener is helpful
-Get physical as soon as possible. Dancing is good for this
-Don't buy drinks. I had switched to water at this point
She was an awesome dry spell breaker

Second success to report is a really weird situation. A close friend from high school and college, etc. but that faded over time as we drifted to different interests. I always thought she was hot and enjoyed her company. In other words, the good news is we already know each other. The bad news is there might as well be the ghost of her dead husband in the room with us. 

Of the women I had been in contact with, keeping it very light. I suggested we go to lunch one day or drinks one evening. She liked the idea, but didn't sound very eager. I needed a way to build some comfort. 

My solution was pretty solid for my particular situation (divorced dad of 3 interested in widowed mom of 3): I invited her to bring her kids and join me and my kids on tubing on a river on Memorial Day. It went very well, but I had to work around an insane baseball schedule for her kids. ""Tuesday night after 9"" was her only opening. 

We went out the next night for drinks, drank a few more beers, and talked until 2AM. She was sitting very close, and I initiated some very light, incidental kino, but was still pretty leery of really going for it. I was having a tough time getting a read on her emotional state. Since we go back a ways, I hated to risk pushing too much too soon and damaging the friendship. On the other hand, and I figured she had to be getting the itch after so long with no man at all in her life. It was confusing

A few nights later, pick her up at her house, etc. Except her sitter cancelled at the last minute, so my oldest daughter stepped in. Like I said, kind of an odd situation. She drove and paid for drinks and snacks at our first stop (I happened to grab the tab on our first meeting. I thought that was a classy move on her part to insist on getting that one. Hell, she even insisted on paying my daughter to babysit, so you could say I made a slight profit on the date). 

We hit a couple of places, but I really started ramping up the kino, still making it seem incidental. I would touch her knee or arm while talking at the bar, took her hand to examine it for some excuse, pretended to brush something off her cheek, just routine excuses to touch her. When we walked between bars I grabbed her hand to move through the crowd, put my hand on her back to lead her to a seat, but in the past I would have been nervous about pushing the physical contact for fear of not seeming like a ""nice guy"". 

Bottom line here is we went back to my place. I told her I had a little herb stashed if she was interested. She didn't have much experience, looked directly at her and held the stare, she just stared back. It was like a challenge: what are you going to do now. I felt that familiar anxiety setting in. I can think of several situations in the past when I let something as obvious as this get away because I was scared to escalate too soon. 

So didn't say anything

What I learned on this one:
-A neutral, etc. Take the pressure off in a setting where you can still build some rapport and comfort.
-Even if you're concerned about emotional state
-When the time seems right, she wore her Victoria Secret panties. She was ready, I just didn't know it. 
-The herb worked well in this situation because it was a novelty, she really did lose ALL of her inhibitions, but this isn't that kind of FR. 

Sorry this FR isn't full of HB this and HB that and lots of PUA lingo. For what it matters, but once they had made up their mind, there was no hesitation or LMR. We're not dealing with college sophomores here. 

Also, hotter women I had talked to before. 

The result is that I feel much more confident in my ability to approach a woman, but I am by not means limited to those women. I open younger women all the time, and I'm still slowly working a couple under 30's that may turn into something. Confidence is key! If I maintain the attitude that I'm the prize and they are lucky to be talking to me, I have way more interest than if I'm supplicating, buying them drinks, being too available, etc etc. I learned that lesson the hard way.

TL; DR: Basic PUA principles work just fine for 40 year old divorced dads. Be bold

In hindsight, when you do this, you are putting the next move squarely on the girl. Girls don't want to be in control - they want you to take the initiative.

I have recently become extremely confident for quite a few different reasons (losing weight

I am very good at eye contact and kino because I have learned to be comfortable around women and realized that touching them is OK and actually fun. Unlike what I used to think

I am not saying that I don't have to talk to women at all but I have been getting K and F closes easily with out telling crazy stories all the time and asking her a million questions. I make constant steady eye contact when ever I am near her or she is talking. I will softly grab her arm at the wrist and gently pull it towards me then let go when i see fit. Perhaps I break eye contact for a while

I let her go talk to other guys in the bar and I will then talk to my friends or someone next to me and she will usually keep looking at me and I will catch her glances. Every girl has come back to talk to me on her own accord after maybe 10 mins talking to someone else.

1365262424.0,1bss0y,[FR]: early 20's female- went out to a pub crawl. First night out since committing to bettering myself and social interactions through seduction techniques,throwaway135798,296,95,165,"By high demand

I'm a female, and often by the end of my work week I just want to be in bed by 8pm. I'm also an introvert, meaning that while extroverts recharge their energy by socializing, it makes me feel drained, and I need to retreat by myself shortly after.

**Goals:**My goals were to have fun

**Outer game:** I know the most important thing for a girl is to look as hot as possible. I don't usually do this because I don't want attention. But last night I wore heels and a short dress.

**Inner game:**Leaving my house, I had three different cat-calls from creepers. I mean like, homeless men and taxi drivers. Secondly, I started reading a really good book on the bus. Nerd alert. I really wanted to go home and keep reading instead of going out. 
**What I learned:** Don't let anything ruffle my feathers so I don't get into a negative mindset before even arriving. If I dress like this

Arrived at the pub, Argentinean and the Spaniard. We sit down and chat. Spaniard and Australian are dating. Argentinean is way too old for me, but I noticed when I first sat down the guys totally sized me up. Again, everyone is reacting really severely to how I dress. I don't know if I'm up for a few more hours of this.
Randomly, he's the sort of guy that probably downloaded a study guide for the book The Game. And yet he still can't get laid... anyway, he's a nice enough guy, and who I end up spending the majority of the night with.

Time's up at this pub and we head to the next. American's friend, so he doesn't have GPS and was getting lost. The pub is crowded. 

American goes and buys drinks for the three of us and I sit with just Moroccan, *""Yeah, holding our liquor and having smart phones...two things that are adults-only""* He says *""Adults only, huh?""* I ignore the sexual innuendo and just *giggle giggle*, I don't want to go there with this guy.
**Lesson learned:** Do more neg's. First ever. Was surprised at how it shifts the dynamic immediately.

Times up and we all move to the next pub. I go back to the girls for a while
**Reminder:**Regardless of appearance, except guys who want easy easy sex, that is. Don't get too drunk, ever...

As the night goes on, what we miss about the states and buying a car eventually in this country. He says he wants to stay here permanently. I do not, but I leave any negativity out of the conversation.

Throughout the night,*""You're beautiful""* I say ""thank you"" but continue talking to Australian.
**Lesson learned:** When I have female-game

American comes back and hands me another drink. He says he and Moroccan are heading to a club after this and asks me to come. I say it's too far to walk in heels, but doing a bad job. He's chatty, but he's too eager to pay for everything for me. It's really nice, and appreciated, but it's so... I don't know. Makes me think he doesn't commend any respect even though he's a physically attractive guy with a career much more successful than mine. The funny thing is, he probably has one more zero in his annual income than I do and has a masters when I only have a bachelor's.
**Lesson learned:** We all determine our own value and our behavior lets other people know what that is.

Moroccan
**Lesson learned:**Talking about politics was bad because it got kind of heated and excluded Moroccan, or game deteriorates quickly!

We get to club. American checks my coat and buys me another drink. The weird thing is, but I have danced with Moroccan before and he is WAAYY too sexual too quickly, and I don't want to dance with American because I am afraid he will make a move. I know the last bus to my house is leaving in about 25 minutes, but I just don't want to be with these guys anymore. I tell them I'm going to head out. They don't seem to mind. Looks like we're all just really drunk. American walks me out to the tram stop. We do the gesture in this country that is equivalent to hugging a friend goodbye. I get on the tram.

I'm not sure what else I should take away from this and learn from. I had a good night. What's more interesting is that I'm going out again tonight in a city nearby that is on a very steep hill and I will NOT be wearing heels

These were my first go at PUA techniques and obviously I need practice - I failed to escalate and my kino was weak

1) As soon as we met they would act distant, and kept physical distance from me and gave really cold body language. I reacted by trying to engage them, but this just gave the feel I was chasing them. There were some IOIs, but I just couldn't get them to leave their shell to emotionally connect with me. I know I need to kino right away, but I couldn't figure out how to do it without being awkward. They put actual physical distance between us that I would need to pull them in to make it possible to kino. Of course the pulling in would be kino, but that was exactly what I couldn't figure out how to do smoothly.

The process of learning how to make a girl your girlfriend was a painful one for me and so I hope that through this article you save yourself the mistakes that I made. 


The first thing that you MUST understand about making a girl your girlfriend is that love never dies of starvation

**.. Familiarity breeds contempt. **

The last thing that you want to do is suffocate your potential girlfriend with too much of you. Space things out and relax. 

**Tip #1: Space out the time you see her. **

If you want her to be your girlfriend you have to allow her to space to miss you. I know that every fiber of your being is saying something different and your heart is yelling at you to call her and see her but you have to allow some space between you two or you will suffocate each other before you know it. This is why I often suggest that you see each other once or twice a week. If you are spending 5 days together you are going to breed contempt at a much quicker pace because you have not allowed the emotions to calm down a bit. 


**Tip #2: Stop trying to “game” her. **

I cannot emphasize enough how important this tip is. Guys who learn some social skills never shut off there “game” and they try to hold her attention with gifts, show emotions and loosen up a bit. 


**She isn’t a game guys

If you continue to “game” her she is going to get the feeling she is getting played and walk at some point. Believe me when I say that I have screwed this up so many times. You have to have the ability to be vulnerable because opening up and sharing is where love is formed. 


**Tip #3: Get a life.**

If you drop your life to be with her she won’t respect you in the long run. Hopefully you had a life before her and you should have one while you are with her. Many times guys will ditch their friends and lives just to spend more time with their crush but all the while they are doing more harm than good. This goes back to a post I wrote on scarcity vs. abundance.(http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/exd7y/scarcity_vs_abundance_how_neediness_kills_your/) If you have no other social options in your life then your neediness will kill every positive gain that you get.  
You MUST man up and overcome your longing to spend every minute with her. Allow her to know what it’s like when you’re not there and give her space to clear her head. When you allow her space you are respecting her and this grows the connection between you two. 


**More Thoughts…**

The more you play the game the less likely you are to win. 
Ever sit down to play games at a casino? If you win but continue to play over time you are bound to lose. If this girl likes you and you continue to play the game then you are bound to lose. People want to feel connected to their partners. They don’t want to feel they are the object of some game but they want to feel like there is another person who connects with them and values them. Being a social robot is about shutting off all emotions that make us human and if you do this you will never keep the girl that you want. 

At the end of the day she doesn’t belong to you and you don’t belong to her. Only she makes the decision to be with you or not and only you can make that decision for yourself. If you shut yourself off and live in a world where you are going to try to “get” this girl then you are setting yourself up for failure. 

Give her space

All the best

1372588213.0,1hcy5d,The shy guy's guide to approach-free pick-up,Morega,261,68,111,"Around /r/seduction and the pick-up community in general

It is difficult to build rapport

It is difficult to build attraction

It is impossible to escalate

There are other reasons that online game might be frowned upon (it doesn’t build social skills like approaching does)

Firstly, bald, and a little overweight. Last summer I was a virgin and had never dated. I’ve always disliked clubs, and I’ve never been good at approaching women in a club or bar setting. When I returned to school last September, I signed up to OkCupid.com. I’ve since slept with over fifty women, despite having changed nothing about my appearance or personality (except that I’ve gotten better at sex).

**I have never slept with someone who I approached as a stranger**. I don’t approach strangers very often, but you do not have to do it to be successful with women.** Overcoming approach anxiety is about making great first impressions, and this can be done in other ways.

My game is extremely routine

1. I send a girl a copy &amp; pasted message on OkCupid. 
2. If she responds
3. I gradually turn the conversation sexual.
4. I arrange a first date.
5. I close.

Most pick-up experts, and (with the exception of step 5) step 3 is where I have the most fun.

The reason that this does actually work is because it’s possible to do before the first meeting what most people do after the approach: build rapport, rapport and attraction must be confirmed during the first meeting and some escalation must occur, but this can easily be taken care of by planning and implementing a good first date, as I’ll explain. Some people will still deny that it is impossible to really build rapport and attraction without meeting in person first, and regrettably I can only reply that it has worked countless times in my experience.

Now, the following guide is primarily for people who would like an alternative to building rapport and attraction after approaching a stranger.

**Set Up a Free Online Dating Profile**

I recommend OkCupid.com. It’s targeted at younger people and students

**“Approaching”**

Once you’ve got your profile set up

Outside of the above, because you’re more likely to get a response if you write a personalized message.  However, you do not want people replying based on your message, but rather based on whether or not they like your profile. If you send a generic message, you can be confident that anyone who replies likes your profile and is interested in talking to you.

The following is an example of the type of message you should send:

“Hey. I just came across your profile. You’ll have to excuse me if this is overly brazen

Most women will ignore this. However

**Laying Down the Foundation**

Once someone has replied to your message and seems interested in talking to you

You: Would you rather have $100 million or your dream job?

Her: Dream job. Would you rather have a pet tiger or a pet eagle?

You: A tiger

And so forth. Other options include *20 questions*

Playing these types of games, if you can conduct yourself intelligently and charmingly, you can also build attraction this way. It helps, of course, to have an attractive photo on your profile, because that’s how she’ll imagine you in her mind. If you consider yourself to be less than attractive, just make sure you have a flattering picture and try to look as good as possible during your first meeting.

Another good tip is to call her before meeting her. In my experience, after a bit of chatting online, it’s easy to transition to a brief phone conversation. In fact, if your game of “*Would you rather?*” turns particularly racy, suggesting that you continue over the phone tends to initiate phone sex without fail. And while phone sex isn’t necessary by any means, I’ve never failed to close a girl after having phone sex with her first.

**The First Date**

Once you feel like a girl’s buying temperature is particularly high (she’s enjoying talking about sex with you and seems interested in meeting)

**Choosing what to do on the first date is crucially important.** If you go from being a fun, keep these points in mind:

1. Make sure you’re able to kino

2. Make sure you’re somewhere where kissing is socially acceptable

3. Know somewhere that you can go if things escalate successfully

This is all standard advice, or bounce her, then she’ll feel like you were fake and are unable to deliver on a fantasy that she built in her head.

My go-to date is actually a bit unorthodox: a local swingers’ club. Yes, friendly, sex-positive, no-pressure, and has both a pool and a sauna.

However, but it all seems to fade away during a one-on-one game of pool. Of course, if you have another preferred method, do whatever you find best.

The story from this point is the same as always: kino, if you’re also fortunate enough to be in a pro-sex establishment).

**[End]**

You can dedicate as much or as little time to this method as you like. I usually spend about half an hour per day on OkCupid sending the odd message; sometimes more if I’m in a heated game of *20 questions*. I typically try to move it to texting, five of whom will want to meet. A little bit of additional messaging might reveal that, of those five, three are significantly more open about their sexuality than the other two. A little bit more harmless flirting and you’ve got three easy closes lined up, for only as much as a game of pool and a drink cost.

This obviously isn’t the best method for everyone. There are social benefits to be had from approaching and approaching often, if you don’t like approaching strangers with the intention of picking them up, I hope this guide might be helpful to you.

Let me briefly explain...

Body language on the seduction guide here was glossed over like a burger in a vegans home.  This shit is one of the most paradigm shifting things I have ever read and I have already seen a MAJOR improvement in my life by being more aware of my and others body language.

The actual science details that by having open, and if you can influence those, you feel like a boss.  By doing power poses we will raise our testosterone (dominance, confidence, aggressiveness, leader brain chemical) levels and simultaneously lower our cortisol (stress hormone!) levels.  

Primates will naturally have raised testosterone and lowered cortisol when assuming the role of alpha male of the group.

I was out last night with a group of friends and I was the designated driver

After entering the club and having a few drinks we started to get into the music and made our way onto the dance floor. We started dancing and lifting each others states, auburn hair style and looked like she had endured several life times of drug and alcohol abuse, and the second was a tall blonde with a terribly mis-shaped body and the face of a particularly unfortunate meth junkie.

So we continued to dance and have a good time when suddenly the blonde pulls one of my buddies up onto the platform and starts dancing with him. I assume at first that he is being a good sport by going along with this - he is laughing and having a good time with it. After about 20 seconds she goes straight in for the kiss, and continues dancing and grinding up against her and I continue under the assumption that he is simply entertaining her.

Two and a half hours later

Now I know what some of you might be thinking at this stage - ""You're just jealous, that this is not what this post is about. In fact, I felt happy for him at this stage - he was getting in there and having a good time and enjoying himself. 

Beer goggles aside

But what really struck me

As we were waiting for our burgers to be made he said to me - ""That was awesome

Here I was

At that point it just hit me, then you'll be stuck with 40 year old meth heads and wondering what you did right to get them to be attracted to you.

After a couple drinks and a few more people show up I'm talking to everyone there, telling her she's gotta have a taco, so I brown a tortilla after mine are toasted.  A little more joking and laughing, I ask her to help me find my drink in the other room, so I grab her hand, lead her into the living room.  She asks where my drink is at, I tell her it's over to my right, she stares back



Afterwards I thought about how I'll see hbgreeneyes again at another BBQ, and maybe she'll be fooling around with some other guy.  The big step for me is being open to this world of casual dating, hooking up, and enjoying women instead of insecurely claiming them in hopes they don't leave me.

**There's No Excuse**

 

**Edit:** Thank you for all the comments

As I was reading I noticed a two major disagreements that I would like to address:

**1)** I need a drink or two to just to raise my energy and let me be social.

**2)** Not drinking makes you look like a creeper

These comments are amazing things to address because *these are the reasons* that we drink.
**They Are Misguided and Will Hurt Your Game!**

**1)** The sober you at the bar is the same person that you were the first day you thought about meeting women. The person you were at the beggining of your sedduction adventure. You struggle to approach, to tease, to escalate, and you struggle to close.  The reason is you used alcohol was to skip steps. You are a slave to alcohol now for the rest of your life because your game requires it.  The first day out sober I was doing No Drink November, and it was weird, I could not approach I could not do anything, when just the week before I was balls deep in the girl with the red dress, I stole her dress and ran around the club. It was the most epic close of my life
So like every good sedditor I stared at square one, building up my skills. Three months later, I have K-closed at least 6 women in the last two night, danced my ass off on open dance floors with people watching incredulously, and have had several propositions for sex from the women whose faces I'm eating. All, Sober.  Having fun and bringing the energy is not something you have, it is something you learn. Everything you do with a beer in you is something you can do better at sober if you stop being lazy and work at learning it.

**Alchohol is *Always* a crutch** as is every other drug, much faster. (Unless it is your schizophrenia medication, in which case it is a crutch you may actually need.)

**2)** ""Not drinking makes you look like a creeper and a stalker, after we have a crazy good time and I make out with them, and then it comes up, or I bring it up, they are always stunned and ask me how I am able to just start kissing a girl when I haven't been drinking. I tell them I am a man who knows what I want! They usually proposition me for sex at this point.

Myth: makes you creepy. **BUSTED**

Makes you look like you are preying on drunk women? Fuck no

**Always try and keep the leader frame. Girls respect guys who make the decisions as to where the night is going.**

I tell her I'll drive so we don't need to take two cars. We zip over to the bar and... it's also empty. We look at one another and I go ""Yeah... let's go someplace else...""

We walk up the block to another bar and FINALLY, but I can tell I'm not in yet.

Eventually we leave that bar and walk back to the bar that was dead earlier. I go to put my hand around her waist and she's not having it... Hmm... I still have work to do with this girl. **I know I say not to waste time looking for IOIs

We arrive and the bar is bumpin - packed with the cool crowd. WOO

I sit us in the booth in the corner. She initially puts her purse between us and I look her in the eye and go ""Nuh-uh

We chat some more and then that Gotye song comes on... 

&gt; **Me:** I like this song.

&gt; **HB-Zooey:** I even have hipster glasses. *pulls glasses out of purse and puts them on*

&gt; **Me:** Wow

&gt; **HB-Zooey:** Please

&gt; **Me:** *as I smack her arm playfully* You fucking hipster! 

She turns beet red

We both have a good laugh and I realize this is the moment where her buying temperature spikes. I pull her in - BOOM - sloppy bar makeout. Some guys sitting across from us start cheering us on. feelsgoodman.jpg :)

We make out some more, she does... We decide to go get her car and drive to her house.

When we get to her car, ""Why does that keep happening?!"" with a giant smile on her face. These are those hilarious moments that you can latch on to that make a good first date. When they happen, just take a mental note.

We zip to her house

Good times :)

**EDIT:** notlurkinganymoar requested some more details about how I met this girl and got her on the date

The previous weekend I went out solo to scope out the scene. I basically watched basketball and sipped drinks like a chode while observing the locals to get the lay of the land.

After all the games were over, then a group of guys, then a mixed set. My go-to line was ""Hey I'm new in town, what's the best bar around here?""

It got me more or less in state, I'm TofuTofu?"" I made small talk with all 3 and quickly determined 2 of them were cold but 1 was receptive. I made her my focus (really nothing but innocent small talk) and exchanged numbers ""so we can explore the city together."" Honestly it was as benign as it gets - it shows sometimes you don't need fancy *game* you just need to have balls to approach. Of course it might explain why I had to work so hard on the day-2, because I never established a sexual frame.

Here is the text transcript:

&gt; **Me:** OMG 8:28 PM

&gt; **HB-Zooey:** Hey u  8:29 PM 

&gt; **Me:** Hi. Out and about?  8:34 PM

&gt; **Me:** Not even sure what Portuguese food is :-)  8:36 PM 

&gt; **HB-Zooey:** Spanish.. beef and spicy shrimp stuff.. I'm obviously not portugese haha  8:37 PM 

&gt; **Me:** Heh. So where you guys going next?  8:45 PM 

&gt; **Me:** I'm gonna head over to [da bar]. Wanna join?  8:52 PM 

&gt; **HB-Zooey:** Were setting off fireworks  9:14 PM 

&gt; **HB-Zooey:** Sorry definitely another night  9:14 PM 

&gt; **HB-Zooey:** Gosh I'm such a lightweight. 2 drinks and I'm drunk lol  9:15 PM 

&gt; **Me:** Sounds like a fun day :-)  9:24 PM 

&gt; **Me:** Cool. How about Monday night? I can keep it free  9:24 PM 

&gt; **HB-Zooey:** Yeah sure  9:25 PM 

&gt; **Me:** Cool. I'll text you Monday. Enjoy your fireworks  9:26 PM 

&gt; **HB-Zooey:** OK. :-) no problem.. enjoy your night!  9:26 PM 

&gt; **HB-Zooey:** My night was s bust. Ended up at [da bar] at the port  1:18 AM

Then we texted on Monday and met.

Another thing I forgot to mention was that I let the conversation get sexual... I brought up this crazy DHV story about a one night stand I had in SF where a girl gave me her safeword, which led me to talk about how, ""I love how sometimes I'll ask a girl for naked pics and she'll send me some in like 2 seconds, so I KNOW those are ones she is reusing from other guys."" Then she says, ""Hah I totally do that,"" and proceeds to show me her nudez on her phone :)

I list this as #1 because your visits to the gym are about more than just getting fast and strong (although that's very important). I recommend getting a membership at a gym that's big on weight lifting and filled with a bunch of good-looking people. Why? Because, or lounge with as many attractive people as at your gym. It provides an understated confidence boost and this makes approaches very easy.

2. Eat well. Don't put junk in your body. People think this is just about getting fat, hell, ANY chain restaurant in the United States, you're filling yourself up with excess garbage. Your body is not designed to consume the abundance of oil, fat, and sugar that you get when you eat at a chain place, so don't. Buy your own groceries

3. Think positively. A lot of people misconstrue derision of others and self-disparagement as meaning you're being honest with yourself or your surroundings. This ""honesty"" trap becomes a self-feeding negative cycle. Instead, you look positive, and that's the type of person people (not just girls) want to be around.

1290898319.0,ecmm8,How I go from number to first date,cheddarchexmix,241,46,62,"I see lots of people here making very rookie mistakes before they even get to first date. [Mouthpiece's post](http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/e645m/text_game_how_to_improve/) on text game has very good advice that everyone should follow. Here are the steps I follow

If you follow this advice, and since then, I've only had 1 girl not respond to my text (turns out she has a serious BF), 1 girl reschedule same day (legitimate reason, I'm still seeing her), and 2 girls show up more than 10 minutes late (women right?).

Here's my strategy:

* I meet a girl, and escalate kino up to but *not including* the kiss (unless I'm going for a same-night hookup). Sometimes it's only light touching, other times it's a lot hotter and heavier, but basically to the point I'm sure she's very interested.
* At this point, I leave the bar (or wherever). Before I leave, I say ""hey I have to go [meet friends blah] but I've really enjoyed talking to you."" She either nods or says something like ""me too."" I say ""we should talk more some time soon"". She says ""yeah that would be good."" I say ""how can we make that happen?"" She says ""I can give you my number"". This sounds weird at first. I read about the technique on Seddit and was skeptical, but it works like magic. I've *never* been refused for any reason. It reduces the flake rate because you basically made it ""her idea"" to give you her number.
* I put her number into my phone. I always ask for her last name
* If I haven't built a ton of attraction, right?"" or ""You know I'm going to ask you out, right?"" They always give an overly enthusiastic ""yeah!"" and it seems to improve responsiveness.
* If she is standing next to me, something like ""OMG its cheddar. You have to help me! This weird stalker girl just gave me her number what should I do??""
* If it's loud, but text her *immediately* with a text that says ""good meeting you tonight. I'll see you soon unless [heckle]! :)"" where [heckle] is some playful tease, hopefully referencing the night, like ""unless you get swallowed up by your monster handbag!"" (I frequently tease girls about their mammoth handbags)
* The next day
* I always pick a bar that is not too busy, and has places to sit where it's natural for us to sit next to each other or at right angles, instead of across from each other.
* If for some reason we had to reschedule or it's going to be more than one day between when I ask her out and when we do go out, saying ""see you at 8!""
* If she starts texting me with a bunch of smalltalky stuff, this conveniently also keeps the casual texting to a minimum.
* In the rare occasion that she cancels
* Then the date is on. I do normal game, then assuming things are greenlit, bounce back to my place after another 1-2 hours.

YMMV obviously

**Common mistakes people make between number and first date**

I see many of the following on Seddit. In order of importance:

* Don't wait more than a couple days before asking her out! She may not even remember you
* Don't incessantly text back and forth before the first date
* Don't ever ask girls out on first dates with less than 24 hours notice. It gives her an easy out to say no
* Don't discuss the time/place for the first date
* Don't try to tease/neg/even joke over text with a girl you've only spent an hour or two with. It's too easy to misconstrue. If you really want to tease
* Don't cancel or reschedule dates unless absolutely unavoidable. Women do this
* Don't offer her your number, and is what I used to do before employing the above technique.
* Don't add her on Facebook, etc. This is personal style, but I'm a big advocate of avoiding ""online game"".

Im 18. No real problem with AA. Really social
Been out before

Tonight I went out after I drank some. My goal was to talk to even more people than I use to and just have fun. No girls tonight (girls didn't really have a chance with me tonight)
My stats were like 50+ people I talked too. A couple over 50 years old. Some milfs. Over 25 people in the first club + the two DJ's and some guards there.
On the way to the second club I talked to probably 10-15 people
The other club was lamer. But still I had fun. Real fun. Danced like crazy, I danced with all the dancefloor - when I saw somebody who wasn't giving 110% I approached them dancing and pumped them up. :)

Here I talked with maybe 10 people. Got one guys number, smiled at him so he knew I was just having fun and I wouldn't try anything, he enjoyed it and smiled back :)
During the night I didn't talk to anybody for over 3-5minutes. Like some other people

Why? Wanted to try going out and not having girls in mind - even though I knew I would succeed. I wanted to try to go out and only have fun! And man it was madness. A lot funnier than usual!

1298824447.0,ftqqa,Dear Nice Guy Friend,minervaxox,302,106,373,"Girl here. I've been lurking here for a while because I'm interested in the psych aspect of pick-up and I have a few things I noticed about my friend. 

I went out last evening with a guy I met at school last week and we decided to hang out (not under the pretense of a date). We went out last night (our third time going out together, so I wouldn't have hated it, but I just didn't feel hot for him.

He obviously wanted to lean over and kiss me when I dropped him off at this place at 4 a.m.

1. Social proof (this can come from texting while you guys are hanging out drinking). It’s not rude because we’re obviously just friends chilling for the moment and if he read texts (or pretended to), so use it carefully. I still believe glancing at your phone every once in a while is a good idea, telling your target about a joke your friend sent you, but I did not mean you should be texting all night.*

2. When I was complaining about being tired

3. Complaining about being cold, not hot.

4. Be spontaneous; know your city and know good places to go out: This is a fairly easy thing to do, know what is going on that evening. You should be able to say, fuck this joint, let’s check out x spot because y is playing tonight. *I want to emphasize this. I'm often the one initiating plans. When a man has a plan, grabs me by the hand and leads the way, the attraction skyrockets.*

5. Compliment: Yeah, I smiled and awwwwed but then he got nervous and dropped a “just so you feel better”. I’ve always thought complimenting takes more confidence than it gives. Confident people recognize positive attributes in others and aren't intimidated by them. *Many of said this is fishing for compliments. Probama mentioned an interesting reply which I will include here:*
&gt;whenever a girl is blatantly fishing for a compliment like this, ""yea, you sure do. aren't you embarrassed?"" with a cheeky smile*

6. Kino: you guys already know how important this is so I will go no further. *There is an interesting distinction to be made in kino. Post by famousmodification:*
&gt;Have you read DiCarlo's Escalation Ladder? He kind of touches on this, which is obviously bad for you.

7. Paying for drinks: I know this is frowned upon, it will really look like you're not interested. Even friends do this for each other. *Very controversial. Upon further reflection, though it would not have hurt in my context, it is safer not to buy a girl a drink. You can read the comments if you're interested*

8. Being present: I’m pretty social myself so I talk to random people wherever I am. And this is an attractive trait for anybody, until I was getting bored and turned around to see him right behind me smiling. Walk in the field of vision of the girl, not behind her. Make sure you’re somewhat loud and keep the conversation going. Make sure you are interacting with other people, and ignoring your target a bit. Show that you don’t need her to have a good time. Flirt with other girls, it makes you look sexy. An extreme example of him disappearing was I unfortunately got into a fight with a drunk girl and 2 guys and 2 girls got in between us, and I actually got teamed up against and he was nowhere to be seen. I completely forgot he was there until the shit calmed down and I turned around and he asked if I was o.k. Seriously, not attractive. 

9. Buzz kill: Never and I say never, don’t be the one to say you’re not in. This is a problem I suspect non-drinkers have, since you come across as a party pooper. But I rarely drink, and I often just say it in a fun way (e.g., I’ll shake my head and say I’m pregnant while placing a hand on my stomach).

10. Driving: I’m always driving him around. I don’t mind in the circumstances (4 a.m. on a cold night) or whatever, offer to take a cab or metro. If she insists, then don’t press, but you should at least offer. Don’t make your target a soccer mom.

Things he did do right:

- He did dress nicely
- He’s pretty funny/clever
- Before making plans for last night, subtle changes in wording or phrases causes people to react differently to what you say. I'm guessing a lot of seduction revolves around this, so worth picking up a book or two on the topic. Any recommendations?
- Before leaving me each time, but it’s important that you create an expectation that you will meet again.
- He made some killer tuna sandwiches for both of us when we went snowboarding, which is something I like to feel with men. But obviously, don't go too far with this.

Okay guys

**a) Introduction**

So at 20 years old, which kept me from making any moves. This girl and the situation were so absolutely perfect, I had no excuses, and took it all the way.

In high school, the works. I started learning and reading about seduction as a hobby, and although I never really had any interest in being a PUA, I thought it was a fun social experiment to try and see how much of an attractive person I could become. So I really began to buy into the self-improvement and inner game aspect of seduction. Of course, along the way I learned a lot of outer-game tricks and tips that I rarely used (simply because I never took things past a few dates, and never kissed). Tonight was absolutely different as I used nearly everything I learned to help guide the interaction to the outcome I wanted. But to avoid getting ahead, fast forward from high school, an attractive personality, and generally able to get people attracted to me, attempting to discover what my limits are

*Take-Away Points: You can move from an unattractive guy to an attractive guy by just putting time and effort into self-improvement. You don't need to immerse yourself in the PUA lifestyle

**b) Meeting the Girl**

So I'm walking to the beach for a social group event with my friends. I'm not always the dominant personality in the group

Anyway

Everyone heads to the water, meeting them, and having short conversations. They all lay down their towels. Then, one girl comes and puts her towel right between me and another girl (who was in the water). There wasn't really any space, but she made space. She laid down and said ""Hi!"" Honestly right then, I knew something was gonna happen with this girl.

She is absolutely gorgeous. Perfect body. Thin, great boobs, well shaped butt. This girl is the definition of my type, and is an objective 8 or 9 to anyone, but a solid 9 to me. 

The rest of the few hours at the beach we chat some, build rapport by talking, communicate value by leading interactions in the group and flirting with the other girls. When HB9 is gone, one of the other girls mentions she is recently out of a 2 year relationship. I knowingly glance at the towel next to me, and she smiles and says ""Rebooound!"" I leave later, HB9 asks me if she will see me at a party that night, I say yes.

*Take-Away Points: Be able to recognize when a girl is into you. I could tell very early my goal was only to be able to remove any obstacles and transition smoothly, jobs, and music, but the nonverbal communication was clear that she was ready to go. Learn through practice how to recognize how interested a women is through her nonverbals.*

**c) The Party &amp; Escalation**

So I'm ridiculously sunburnt, you can overcome this with game. Lots of average-looking people get women and you're just sunburnt. So I clean my room, go buy some mints and condoms, and head to the party. I've never bought condoms before in my life, but for some reason I knew I was gonna have this girl tonight. 

At the party, and start having a good time. When HB9 arrives, I'm the center of a drinking game with an HB7 and HB8.5 beside me (neither are very attracted to me, but they are both very friendly and HB9 certainly can't tell the difference. We subtly avoid each other for the next 10 minutes, but when I catch the eye I give her the subtle smug ""I want to fuck you"" look. *Master this. From my limited experience I know this look turns girls on.* I notice she starts to move towards a large chair, and I join her and we sit down simultaneously, with my arm around her. I say ""Hey."" She says ""Hi."" We don't really talk but I escalate kino rapidly, I hold her stare, and we jokingly start cuddling for a while. 

The rest of the night is hilarious. I don't really speak to her much, and she comes to sit by me. I'll say something like ""You know I'm going to take you home tonight."" or ""I can't wait to fuck you."" and she gets up and leaves. This repeats 4-5 times with no other conversation over an hour. This girl is shit-testing the fuck out of me. I handle it all perfectly. This stage is really where I shine. Later I'm on the couch and she's on the floor. She motions for me to join her, and I motion for her to join me. She looks away, so I start flirting with the girl beside me. She leaves, and I go to sit on the floor with a friend. As soon as she sees me on the floor, she runs back and sits directly in front of me. She hints away for a while, trying to get me to kiss her. I don't and I tell her I value privacy, once I kiss you, between her legs, I did without hesitation. She comes right behind me

Then she goes into this strange ""decision making mode"" where she keeps leaving me to talk to her friends. She's obviously talking about me and I remain self-amused, who she is staying with. They talk for a while, and she leaves for the bathroom. I ask him what the deal is. He sort of incredulously says ""She just asked me if it was OK if she went home with you?"" I said ""well?"" he said ""Yeah I mean I told her definitely, but said you were a virgin. It kinda freaked her out."" She returns from the bathroom, sits beside me, and immediately says ""Are you a virgin?"" I reply ""Wanna find out?"" she says ""Just tell me."" without hesitating I say ""Yep"" like it's not a big deal. She says ""So we probably aren't gonna have sex?"" and I reply ""We won't do anything you aren't comfortable with."" Gold. This throws it back on her and she doesn't know how to respond. She comes up with ""Well I mean you won't have sex with me."" and I respond ""Woah, I only wanted to hold hands."" This seems to satisfy her.

Next she starts asking about how she is going to get home etc. Anytime she shit tests, I respond very seriously and maturely. She occasionally tries to get me to convince her to come home with me. I don't fall for these. She says ""We probably shouldn't do this."" I respond ""Yeah, we shouldn't."" Then she asks ""But can you take me back to minivan guy's house?"" I say ""Definitely, I can take you back anytime before 9:30."" It was critical to be able to distinguish a shit-test of ""I wanna see if you'll try to convince me to fuck you"" and an actual ""I need you to solve this logistical problem for me."" She asks me to get her girlfriend's phone numbers, and I do this seriously as well. I met them earlier but can't remember their names, so I hand them my phone and say ""Can you put your last name in too?"" 

*Take-Away Points: Be able to be self-amused in any situation. Have other options. She played push/pull with me for a while and I was able to transition from her to someone else easily.*

*Make sure you help her handle the logistics. Ahead of time I mentioned to my friends I may try to take her home

*Be comfortable handling different types of shit-tests. Even though I only browse seddit occasionally

*Know your audience. I knew this girl was into me

**d) My house**

We go to my house and I escalate with something similar to the ever-popular Di-Carlo Escalation ladder which I happened to remember. Everything goes smoothly (although I'm not that great at anything...). Then I ask, which I had planned to do, I decided that would be a butthurt reaction. I slowly ramped things down, and then took it to cuddling. She tries to kiss me and I say ""You probably just want to cuddle right?"" I keep teasing her as I quickly ramp things up, as she is visibly turned on, then shut it down with some comment like ""This is probably too fast for you."" 

Finally she says ""Turn me on."" I do, do you not want me?"" and I realize there's no way I can pass up this gorgeous babe without regretting it. The rest is history. It wasn't really great sex for either of us, but she was really nice and very very considerate. We communicated really well, and it was surprisingly a super intimate experience. Unfortunately, it was clear she wasn't as attracted to me at this stage as she was before when there was more mystery and intrigue. To be expected as this was my first time. I'm just glad I built up enough momentum in earlier stages. Afterwards I realized I forgot to ask how old she is. I ask, and she responds ""16."" and we laugh. She's the same age as me, 20. 

**e) Aftermath**

It sounds like she wants to see me again. She wanted me to hang again with her before she left, I also discovered she also has an identical twin sister. 

Any advice on how to handle the relationship from here? I'd like to keep it going long term and be able to see her whenever it's convenient to visit (and honestly

I also had a little bit of an existential crisis the next day. I'm pretty sure I'm never gonna be able to land anyone more attractive than her. This girl was it. It was a perfect situation.

Her: ""I'm actually a model""
Me:  ""what like a hand model?""
Her: ""I was in Playboy
Me: ""That can be scary. My mom grew up in a tiny superstitious village in India and she believed she could tell your future by reading your palm.""

At this point she pressed her hand into mine and asked me to read it. I took my time reading it then chucked her hand back to her

A Playboy model bounced ME.

We kissed pretty viciously at the hookah bar. She showed me some pics on her phone from her Playboy shoot. She also showed me some pics from when she dated Mark Stoermer from The Killers (insane). Her phone was out so I used this as an excuse to procure her number. 

The social proof was intoxicating. A random girl actually walked up to me and whispered in my ear ""you need to do ANYTHING this girl tells you to do tonight."" [quick aside: I was a bit annoyed. I think the subtext is ""this girl looks too pretty for you."" Her comment actually threw me off a lot]

We made plans to hang out Tuesday night. I'm pretty sure she'll flake (it's been happening a lot to me lately) but who cares? It was such an awesome experience and I feel godlike right now.

I've tried direct approaches too. They can work

If you're on here, not approaching....STOP. Just say hi to her. Say the first thing that comes to mind. Ask for fake directions, the time, whatever. Just say something, and you'll improve.

**Pro Tip:** Ditch the headphones. They distract you from your surroundings

Don't worry about her headphones. If you grab a girl's attention

**Second Tip:** If you're in a prolonged situation (sitting by her in a cafe, I had previously asked her to watch my stuff while I went to the bathroom. It's a small request, but it can have pretty big effects:

1. She's now aware of you. When you later start a conversation
2. She's already committed to doing something for you. This will subconsciously raise your value in her mind.

**Edit:** The point of this is to say the first thing you notice about her

Girls don't really care how you start conversations. And the more conversations you have

* Sit next to the pretty girls in class, practice makes perfect. Walk in, find the cutest girl there and sit next to her. 

* You can't go out (especially to parties) thinking there's some magical combination of words that makes a girl like you. Girls view you as a whole. Be interesting, smile at her, joke/tease her, touch her (lower back area is a favorite of mine), and just **BE YOURSELF**. I guess this applies anywhere. Think less, do more.

&gt;**How do I get this one girl?**

&gt;You don't. Seduction can only help you become more attractive to women in general, game will be pointless.

&gt;[...] There is no saving you

Get it? You get that girl by being the type of guy who attracts lots of other girls. And at that point

&gt;Hi, explain that you don't.

&gt;You develop the skills to get girls, but are a fresh slate you can write your name on in big, bold letters.

&gt;**There's only one real reason you want that girl. It's because you haven't developed the skills yet to meet thousands of other girls

&gt;You're wrong. You're dead wrong. And because you're afraid of meeting other girls

&gt;Get out. Start fresh. Lurk here for a while and read before you ask the single question that comes along every six days or so.

&gt;And then go out and meet a thousand other girls who are better than this girl with whom you've spent the last seven years erasing any opportunity of romance until you entirely rebuild yourself from the ground up.

1303804443.0,gxmjn,Lessons learned from 1st game-driven relationship,KamikazeeKid,243,50,121,"Hi Seddit

Recently I had a breakup with a solid HB8, but I wanted to share with you what I learned from it.

**Know what to watch for** (success #1)

A friend of mine invited me to a happy hour. Alice was there, and I was inadvertently using his mannerisms. I was reclined, hands in my pockets, saying very little, just listening and only contributing to conversation when I really had something to say. Because I had read Mystery's book, I was able to read her IOI's. I told her I was learning Latin dances, which gave her an excuse to ask for my number so we could meet up to Salsa, as she added, and making her stop me and say ""wait-!"" I practiced my Latin dance moves for another week and half before calling her. I was truly in the right frame of mind about her: she could have me on my time

**Not being on Facebook=DHV** (success #2)

As we parted that first night she asked if I was on Facebook. I said ""no

**Make her wait** (mistake #1)

We connected on the first date and kissed. The second date we made out like high schoolers and her shirt came off. The third date we had sex. This was in the span of 4 days. Within 10 days of that, but I probably came off as eager. Also, the rapid timeframe didn't allow enough time for me to qualify her and demonstrate the case for my interest in her. The dynamic of the relationship changed after committing. She became more demanding and I became less independent. We acted entitled to each other and our expectations were too high.

**Don't get complacent** (mistake #2)

As I became more devoted to her, and I never pursued my own interests and social relationships at the expense of my nascent relationship with her.

**Avoid serious conversations** (mistake #3)

Alice wanted to know what the future held for us. I might be leaving the country for two years this summer. Our conversations about the future came way too soon, supplanting what could have been fun times with heavy conversation, and making her question our long term compatibility. 

**Be measured in expressing your affection** (mistake #4)

Naturally a hopeless romantic and beta male, I made her heart skip beats--but at the cost of taking her off of her toes a little too much. 

**Remember the testing never stops** (mistake #5)

She would talk about men she had met or hung out with in the past who were rich and ""gorgeous"" and throw other tests at me. These were great opportunities to show her I didn't give a damn about her preferences in men

**Don't compromise yourself** (mistake #6)

We split a bottle of wine on our first date. I hadn't drank for more than a month, eating rich meals, and making it to the gym less and less. She was hot but didn't ever work out, she drank much more than me, she smoked, and was altogether not committed to physical self-improvement the way I was. But I let her habits influence me, and only now am I finally getting back to my old positive habits--but I have an extra quarter inch around my waist and a rekindled fondness for booze and fatty food to contend with.

**Don't tell her your ""number""** (mistake #7)

This one is huge. One time, I don't think so. I suppose you'd have to define it."" She says, ""over or under 20 partners?"" I laughed and said ""oh, under! I've only had 12."" I had a golden opportunity to amuse her, be cocky and mysterious, or even coyly suggest that I truly was some casanova--but the straightforward response I gave her not only squandered that opportunity, but somehow turned her off. 

**Don't go soft** (mistake #8)

After a few weeks with her, a girl in a lyotard (!) with eclectic tattoos just straight up hit on me. I merely made some flirty banter at her and deliberately avoided escalating. Another time, a smoking hot black girl looked long and hard at me running on the treadmill in my red Chairman Mao shirt, and I didn't even bother to talk to her. A hot blonde eyefucked me sore, and it turned out we were parked right next to each other--but I said nothing. All for the sake of being the good boyfriend, I avoided valuable opportunities to engage with women just for practice. Of course, this was before I saw the end coming.

**See the end coming** (success #3)

Two weeks before the end, and she would use it as an opportunity to voice her concern that we had communication problems. I picked up on what she was doing: she wanted to make things hard for me so that I would initiate the breakup. Years ago, a girl pulled this one on me. But I wouldn't let Alice make me pull the trigger when I wasn't even holding the gun. I voiced my optimism about the relationship, tried to avoid and defuse petty conflicts, and refused to reward her bitchiness with my attention. But I knew the days were numbered, so I started lining up other prospects and thinking outside the relationship.

**Rebound fast and hard** (success #4)

She broke up with me on a Sunday morning. It took her an hour and a half because I adamantly refused to do the deed, we had sex, which I regret. I left and felt very upset, even though I knew this was for the best. As I drove away, a girl I had been working on for several days, who I'll call Mika, called me up. She wanted to hang out, as she was leaving the country to do scientific research in the jungle for 3 months. I picked her and her luggage up later that evening and we had sex four times that night. She flew to South America the next morning. Losing Alice sucked

**Don't look back** (mistake #9)

Later that night, and having done nothing wrong, I simply told her yes. Alice knew it was Mika and this particularly upset her because she knew Mika and I had gone out for drinks a couple of weeks prior--which she had permitted but was uneasy about. She went from shocked, to angered, to anguished and in tears in the span of three minutes. Then she told me to leave and to not call or text her. I regret going back to see her, and I realize it was because I had been secretly hoping that she might have changed her mind. 

The whole thing lasted just 10 weeks, and also it was the first relationship I've had since a breakup a year and a half ago that shook my world and got me reading about game in the first place.

**The Dark Age**
-----
I am a 24 yr old virgin

* dumped by a girlfriend that I never f-closed after 2 yr relationship
* started extremely hard studies from which I was almost thrown out;
* got verbally abused to unbearable levels by my mother which suffered from some kind of schizophrenia. I was living only with her

Such state of things put me into 2 years of depression during which I thought daily about suicide.

After one year, I miraculously managed to not get thrown out of my studies and finally escaped my mother with the help of rest of my  family. Switching flats every couple of months, I concentrated fully on studying.

4 years later I managed to catch-up with my studies and work, ridiculed, manipulated and considered a creep/stalker.

However

*CHALLENGE ACCEPTED*

When nearing completion of my studies I went on a student exchange program. This boosted my confidence considerably and my numerous efforts at girls started to finally bring some fruits. I still got miserable results and often got very strong depression strokes

**Becoming Alpha**
-----
I started to work out, got huge confidence boost and I met a great guy who pointed me to seddit. I learned about kino escalation, shit tests, traits of alpha male etc. I started doing cold approaches. Having wide arms + knowing the tricks of the trade made THE difference. In my social circles I managed to seduce all girls I was interested in. They were begging me to kiss them, kissing me without asking or inviting on 1-on-1 to their room. However, for various reasons, like cluelessness or lack of clearly defined goals

**From approach to the meeting**
-----
After about 15 cold approaches and 5 #-closes, but still got flaked. However, after two days or so I met her by accident on the bus, talked with her a bit and ended conversation with words ""so, should I give up on you or should I call you?"" ""you can write me an email"".

We started emailing with some really sexual frame of ""challenges"" going on

&gt; If you want to know anything about me, the more interesting the challenges will get. I hope you won't disappoint me.

after positive responses from her (e.g. ""I hope I won't disappoint you and pass your challenges...  I am bit scared

&gt; You have absolutely nothing to worry about. Before I will put the harder challenges into you

One really funny thing about this email game was that I was framing myself as the dominating sexually-experienced male while in reality I was a virgin and she was framing herself as a scared clueless girl

Finally we set up for a meeting at 7 pm

**The meeting**
-----

I got a plan to kiss her in the neck at the very beginning but got confused by the fact that she didn't arrived by bus, first challenge, hold my hand. It sounds easy, but it isn't. As long as you are holding it, you can ask me questions"". She went for it. We walked 10 minutes straight into my flat. Before entering it I hugged her and made an attempt to kiss her, but she dodged it. We sat and talked a bit. I started to caress her arms and legs but she got very locked embryo-like body position. To break the ice I started to tease her about her locked body language, give her commands like ""turn around, take your blouse off, I knew I should've read it yesterday"". She went for all my commands and started moving around my room being curious about various stuff. When she kneeled to look at my exercise mat I grabbed her and we started to wrestle on the floor

We continued a bit rape-like wrestling

* Are you doing it often with other girls? **Answer:** Every day! All right
* So you really thought it is going to happen today? **Answer:** Well
* So it is only about my body! *dresses up and wants to leave the flat* **Answer:** No! *I throw her at the couch and do heavy qualification by talking about my past

I also threw in from time to time a decent joke which always made her laugh
&gt; *While she was rubbing against me half dressed* So

&gt; *Her colleague texted her and she was texting back* Why are you texting NOW? Ah

&gt;...no no

&gt;You can... teach me a lot? Oh God *gasp* *gasp* OK take a deep breath.

&gt;But of course I want to have sex with you

&gt;Tell me if I am doing it right

&gt;Damn

&gt;What

&gt;So you eat so much and then sleep a lot? Its surely to feed these *touch her huge breasts*.

Before the qualification it was really hard to kiss her or undress - lots of rape-like wrestling (I loved the freeze-up breaks  when she took off her glasses, we did a lot of kissing, I took care of her breasts and after a while she said ""so you are a virgin... but I am experienced and I can teach you a lot. Just relax"" and I got a BJ-close + a bit of bite marks. She was adamant about not undressing her down ""not on the first time"". I walked her home.

**Remarks**
-----

So yea, so what I am going to do when I try to sleep with other girls?"" ""Well, then you will have something to talk about!"", and about her ex-boyfriend. Theoretically textbook mistakes, but I kept my ultra-positive, relaxed and confident mind frame so it played out well in the end. Other important things to remember:

* Don't know what to do? Just caress her, you just need to proceed more slowly.
* Consider everything a shit test. As stated on [wiki on Sperm Wars](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sperm_Wars)

&gt;But finally, then physically. The stronger and more realistic her resistance, the better the test.

Keep this in mind all the time. She once even said ""Damn

A few of my favorite **quotes** from his blog posts are:

&gt;When I was first training myself up as a persistent guy, so we’re much more hands off and if a woman says, “No, I have to get up early tomorrow,” we just accept it and back down, even if that’s not what she wanted us to do. Can you picture a Latin man or an Italian man letting it stand at just one refusal?

&gt;Italian: Come with me

&gt;Girl: Alas

&gt;Italian: Oh

**and**

&gt;""But the thing is -- that anger and insult is terribly misguided. Because it isn't you that a woman's rejecting -- it's your approach to her

**or**

&gt;""Eventually some of the pieces started coming together. I learned to talk about myself a lot less and get girls talking about themselves much more. It didn't make much sense at first

**or**
(my favorite)
&gt;""The only time the nice guys actually get the girl is when she’s finally had her fill of bad boys and decides that it’s time to settle down with a nice guy who will take good care of her. The bad boys enjoy her when she’s young and vivacious, however, is not nice because he’s a legitimately warm-hearted soul, like those strong men we just mentioned. Instead, he’s nice because he’s **scared**. He’s scared that if he comes off as too assertive, or too aggressive, or too masculine, in the end, “Well, no thank you.” Of course not! I’m willing to bet you a hundred dollars that the entire reason he told her he was looking for a serious relationship was because that’s what he thought she wanted to hear - he probably thought it was the “safest bet” at getting her. I’m sure he’s a great guy

**and**

&gt;""Oh, ""Does this girl really understand what she just missed out on?"" (my personal favorite). Then go get back on the saddle and meet some more girls.""

**last but not least**

On one hand

On the other hand

One example is the so-called IOI (indicator of interest). The idea that women do certain gestures (grooming

The problem came with the application. According to old-school Mystery Method, your interest is never shown BEFORE HERS.

This idea is still pervading

Sure, you'll blow it with the hotter girls, who often show subtle or no signs, even when attracted.

The only true test of the interaction is compliance. If you try to move/touch/sexualize/qualify and she lets you

It's easy for a girl to just stand there and smile while you spit out jokes, now she's forced to make a decision. ""Do I like him enough?""

So think of qualification/touch as a litmus test. Ping her; if she doesn't comply

This is a key concept. Don't wait for ""permission"" to do something, touch, etc. Anything that shows interest.

Think about it. Only someone insecure would wait for a signal or invitation to start showing the interest they felt all along. Would a rock star do that? No. 

If you have hot girls in your life

Showing interest IS NOT weakness. That's the misunderstading of classic Mystery Method

You can show interest in a confident way. Or you can show interest in a needy way. Only the latter is a problem.

On the other hand, would ever do that.

Forget about IOIs. Make moves

I'm in Madison Square Park, about 22.

Talking to a girl who's standing, but it's been a while since I've hooked a girl who is lying down in the middle of the lawn.

No shame in admitting I'm a bit intimidated.

But that's okay

The first step is positioning myself near her. Even though I feel a bit apprehensive

I walk as if I'm going past her and  then stop about four feet away from her. I'm not facing her but nor am I facing away. She's off to my side. 

I pull out my phone and look at it.

The next step: Say something.

I decide I am simply going  to ask her my opening question. That's it. And... see where it goes from there.

If she's not responsive

 ""H-hey"" I say

I'm trying not to look at her fabulous ass in those tight

 ""There is

""Like

""It's not that big.""

""Okay

""I think it's a good zoo

""Do you know if they have penguins? Because I've been really in the mood for penguins.""

""I think they have penguins

""Awesome. Maybe I'll hire you as my personal tour guide.""

She laughs.

And then picks up the conversation.

""Where else are you taking them?"" 

This is my invitation to stay longer. You generally won't find a stronger invitation than this.

""I don't know

""Yeah

""You know some good spots?"" I ask.

She mentions the Museum of Natural History.

""Isn't there the Museum of Sex?"" I ask. I am purposely injecting sex into the conversation. Somehow talking about sex does a lot of good things. It raises tension and shows I'm not afraid to talk about inappropriate topics.

""That is somewhere near here.""

""Is that any good?"" I ask.

""I've never been there.""

""You're not the type of girl to go to the Museum of Sex?""

""I've never had the opportunity"" she says and laughs. ""I haven't been here that long. Only like a year."" 

Another indicator that she's interested in conversation. Practically setting up the next question I ask.

""Where did you move from?"" I take the bait but then pull it away from her. ""Wait. Don't tell me. Let me guess..."" 

I sit down next to her.

""You moved from... New Jersey!"" I say. She doesn't react so well to my tease.

""I'm just busting on you

""Maybe with my outfit

When a girl acts insecure or says something negative about herself like this

""I'm from California

We start getting deeper into conversation

I still tease her a bit

That's always a good sign.

This girl is sweet and definitely into me. After about 15 minutes

The grass is a bit wet and I wipe off my pants as I get up.

""My ass is wet from sitting on the ground. Promise me you won't stare at it when I walk away

""I don't think I can keep that promise

1350405585.0,11ks6a,Learn from Drunk You to improve Sober You (crosspost),TofuTofu,230,43,45,"This is taken from a comment on 2XC. As a rule

&gt; Man

&gt; Levity aside, and I always secretly envied those who did, because they seemed to be having so much fun. I didn't understand it: they would say things that were either nonsensical or completely obvious, and everyone would roar with laughter and slur something about how hilarious it was. They would flirt and simper with all the subtlety of elephants, and the drunken targets of their affection would lap it up. And I just sat there, sober, shaking my head.

&gt; But as time went on

&gt; Drinking doesn't change who you are. It doesn't make you funny or sexy. All it does is weaken your inhibitions, formerly-private thoughts. If sober you is a passionately sensual creature held back by insecurity about her appearance, drunk you might march out onto the dance floor to flaunt her body to anyone who wants to watch.

&gt; But in both of those cases, you can laugh it off. ""Yeah, sorry, I was so wasted I didn't even know what I was doing!""
&gt; Drinking is easy. Being an awesome person while drinking is also easy, is learning how to be awesome without relying on alcohol (or other drugs). Anyone can shake their ass when they're drunk, but it takes a lot of confidence and positive body image to do it sober.

&gt; Don't envy drunk you; learn from her. Let her show you how you want to be, so start being more assertive in conversations. Does drunk you enthrall people with her stories? They're your stories, even when you're sober; volunteer them more often!
&gt; Drunk you may be funny and sexy and endearing, all zany big lips and anime eyes.

&gt; Sober you

This is a great example of the importance of retrospection. No one can know you better than yourself. Always analyze your behavior and work to improve yourself.

It is not uncommon to see posts from guys who are frustrated with a particular woman, y, or z.


And very often, move on."" The advice is often correct and sometimes the questioner does move on, but still very often they do not. ""But what if..."" ""But I really like this one..."" etc. One reason for this hesitancy to take the advice is their lack of experience, which means they have had little exposure to the warning signs and other guys need to point them out, explain why these are a problem, and why he'll be better off forgetting about this woman.


But what is less discussed is what sort of mindframe guys have that lead them to that point in the first place. That is, to avoid getting to that point. The problem is that many, many guys have already set themselves up for frustration, failure, and heartbreak before they ever get started. I'm going to explain to you how to stop that shit in its tracks right now.


Chances are about 95% of your male friends are fucking up in the way I'm about to explain and your exposure to them is only teaching you that this sort of mindset (more below) is normal, are in awful relationships and marriages, and find their dicks boxed up and on a shelf eventually. Want to avoid all that? Thought so.


The problem is in what you want and prioritize. Yes


Here's the problem: Somewhere along the line (from social conditioning) you've prioritized meeting ""HER"" and maybe once you find ""HER"" even marrying her. It is on your ""to do"" list. --- (a) Go skydiving, have great sex, and maybe live the rest of your lives together skydiving and writing novels. You get the picture.


Part of our culture's social validation is being in a long-term relationship. It is viewed as living a successful life, movies and so on make fun of shitty couples. We know simply being in a LTR does not equate to success in life but we tend to ACT like it is as a sort of default setting. And the more we act in a particular way the more we trick our brain into believing it (a sort of corollary to many PUA tips).


Now here's why this is fucking you up. Once you've put this on your ""to do"" list as a, you've set yourself up without even knowing it. How's that, you say? Well, think of it this way. You meet a babe, you hit it off, go on some dates, have great sex


She turns into a nag, etc. (not all girls do this once in a LTR, but many will). She tries to control you, has jealousy fits, and so on. And what do many guys do?  They stay with her, take her shit, try to fix it, and their balls shrivel up and die. Later, cheat on him/dump later


The gist of it: When you prioritize meeting women to get into a relationship as one of the ""things to do"" in life, seen friends do it, read dozens of posts that report on the end results of such behavior, etc.). What happens when you DO NOT prioritize LTR/marriage as a ""thing to do"" in life? You don't take crap, you get rid of needy/naggy/bitchy women rather quick. You don't lead yourself down the road of supplication that ends in the township of misery. You keep your self-respect. You'll be single/without dates a bit more, yes, but there's nothing worse than being worried about pissing your woman off


Look back on your experiences with women. Has that ever happened to you? If so


Now, be independent, make your own rules, and if a woman comes along that wants to be pulled into that world, you can choose to do so, rather than running around like a simpering caffeinated monkey begging her let you into hers.

I always see advice along the lines of ""fake it till you make it"" that while valid

Answer me this, do you see yourself as someone worthy of respect? Admiration? It is one thing to tell someone to walk into the room as though he owns it, it is another thing for that person to believe it.

Inner game cannot be a mask you put on when you need it- it doesn't work that way. The moments in our lives when we are most confident are those times when everything is going smoothly- why? Because you know that success with this random girl or not- you are feeling good about yourself and nothing will change that. In essence- you have a safety net. Having multiple prospects serves a similar purpose. 

When your state and confidence does not depend on a successful pick up

The question is, i do, you do, that causes us to lose a little respect in ourselves. Some of them can be minor, like succumbing to another scoop of ice cream or being afraid to interrupt a friend whose story has gone on too long when you're in a hurry, some can be major, like chickening out on that backpacking trip or putting up with a job where you get no respect out of fear of the unknown or approaching a girl you like.

It doesn't matter what it is or how big it is, and you loathe yourself for it. You are aware you have diminished yourself- and your self esteem weeps.

""Never lose your self-respect, rather out of respect for your own virtue than for the strictures of external authority.""

Baltasar Gracian (1601 - 1658)

Hold yourself to a higher standard. I mean your *own* standard. And you know what your standard is- you know the shit you do that makes you feel small and shitty inside. Cut it out. Even if no one notices, room cleaning, overdue books- whatever. Move gradually onwards- your guide will only be what makes you feel small- let nothing be safe.

I have been getting real down about myself and worrying about my constant dry periods in life when I landed upon this and thought r/seduction should check it out. I am not dissing the game

_______


Hey guys

I am in the minority on this website when it comes to sex, but there are things far more important than sex going on in my life. As a guy that refuses to publicize my private life to the internet I get a lot of static (criticism), on my website, on this forum, on my videos, even on my facebook fan page I've had people say that I was some loser that can't get laid. It really doesn't matter to me that much when someone has animosity toward me and says ""You can't get laid."" Honestly what is the obsession with needing to get laid? People around here measure your value by your sex life, does that really make sense? Don't forget you are full of shit if you don't post field reports

Go over this in your head one time: What is the attitude of the guy who gets laid a lot in regards to sex? It's NO BIG DEAL, him fucking x girls in x days shows nothing but a lack of confidence and a huge ego. Why do you need to qualify for us? Who the fuck are we that it matters that you got laid x many times in x many days?

I am kind of getting just down right tired of this form of measurement in the community, the times when I was in a dry spell were times when I was unhappy and constantly thinking about getting laid. How do I have to approach her? What should I say? Bla Bla Bla - all these bull shit thoughts got in the way of actually getting laid. Why? Because getting laid is easy, it's you that makes getting laid hard. People don't realize getting laid is more about getting out of your own way then doing all the right shit when you have good attractive traits. A woman more easily forgives a man she is attracted to when he makes mistakes throughout courtship.

Rather than worrying about getting laid and forcing things, whether that is to fuck 10 girls, or 100, whether that is to find a wife, a girlfriend, or whatever else. You knowing what you want in your love life will help you birds eye everything.

Happiness thought: Do you think guy A who has fucked 1000 girls is happier then guy B with a wife, the guy who is happiest defines what he wants and goes after it. That's cool you want to fuck 50 girls whatever, but in my experiences when you are running up your numbers you aren't making yourself happier (in fact when I was going through them fast my life was way more stressful). Your actions can make you happy or not but that is up to you. My personal happiness isn't defined by the amount of girls I sleep with, it never will be, perhaps your happiness is linked to fucking 100s of women that is cool too, it's just not for me.

Two things I think a lot of people miss on here are: You obsessing with getting laid won't get you laid

Your belt notches don't make you ""The Man"" or happy. You aren't the shit because you fucked 2000 women

My next statement plays more off the fishermen thought, fast food restaurants, sit down restaurants, bus rides, airplane, and even walking down the street.

So guys stop obsessing about all the bull shit when comes to getting laid

It's not about getting laid, it is about just being happy. Get over your numbers, get over your ego, and get over close rate. Just be happy and attractive, that will get you laid because to anyone that has gotten fair amount of tail getting laid is just NO BIG DEAL. Take on that attitude you'll be happier and more appealing to women.

Peace and Love

EDIT:  Wow I just came back and this thread blew up over night.  Thanks a lot of all of the replies guys I read everything! Martial arts seemed to be a pretty common recomendation and I'll look into it for sure.  I can see how some controlled fighting would help me gain some perspective.  I probably wouldn't be too bad at it either I'm about 6'1"" 185 lean ;).  Someone also mentioned watching ESPN which I never thought about because sports aren't my thing but watching the people on the channel could be worth my while.

Had I known the thread would get so much attention I probably would have expanded a little more.  I used to be a fat kid, and there is some potential for me to intimidate other people which brings me to whats going on.  I guess I sort of appear alpha to someone who hasn't met me.  I'm real big on eye contact and body language (thanks seddit) but I just haven't really internalized most of this yet.  It's not so much a physical confrontation that bothers me (although with some people this is the case) its the little shit tests I get from guys a lot.  And then once I fail its almost like some of these guys try their absolute hardest to stroke their egos at my expense.  It's little things, like disagreeing with all of my opinions and trying to make me look weak etc.  This is a distinct weakness of mine. This sort of thing has been going on for years and honestly I really don't think the women present when this happens realize whats going on; I just begin to look weak to them. I thought I could circumvent the issue by getting better with women but like someone in this thread mentioned I have to learn to seduce these alpha bros a little.  My problem is really reasserting and maintaining my dominant frame; letting these guys know that I am also alpha. Like back in the day I still have a tendency to slip into a validation seeking spot once this stuff goes on and everything just goes to shit. 

This is definitely an inner game issue and I recognize that but it's also something I just hate as well.  I hate ""getting into it"" with these people but they are unavoidable if I want to be around high status girls.

This list I wrote may help some of you out.

* If you're talking to a cashier and she tells you for any reason when she gets off work

* If a girl gives you her number

* If a girl repeatedly mentions how she wishes she had a nice guy to date

* If a girl asks about your relationship status out of the blue

* If a girl you don't know approaches you and asks for the time

* If a girl who is not a best friend type suggests watching a movie when you two are hanging out alone

* If a girl says she ""needs to talk to you""

* Physical touching while a girl is having a conversation with you usually means she is interested.

* Any time a girl seems to giggle WAY more than she should during a conversation

* If a girl you're not very close friends with mentions the fact she broke up with her ex and is looking for 
someone new

* A girl almost never talks about wanting a one night stand to a guy unless she wants to with him. (This is more on the topic of sex than dating

* This one blows my mind that some guys miss! If a girl asks to sit next to you somewhere where there are other viable empty places/tables to sit at

* If a girl starts talking about ""how well you two get along""

* If a non-best friend girl is with her friends and ditches them to hang out with you

* If a girl tells you she's lonely at home (by means of text, phone, etc. etc.), she wants you to come over! She most likely is interested in you!

* If a girl says she's really cold in an obviously warm environment

* If a girl starts complaining about how all the guys just want her for sex, I can't guarantee she'd really be the type most guys would want to date. At the same time, this can be one of the few less obvious hints, where she is testing how you react and judging your answer to see if you're someone she's interested in.

* If a girl says she's ""new in town"" and wants someone to show her around

* If a girl seems to be smiling with you way more than she does when she talks to other people

* I know it's cliche

* A girl who keeps beating herself up on her looks, she could just be looking for attention. If she does it often to multiple people, it's probably the latter.

* In most contexts

* If a girl talks about how long she spent getting ready and then asks your opinion on how she looks, parties, etc. etc.)

* Girls like confidence. If you think a girl is interested in you

* If a girl is constantly leaving you to talk very briefly to her other female friends

I had a straight up serious case of onenitis and I was basically crawling into a shell of desperation and desire for this one girl. In my head I was thinking ""the one girl that actually liked me left me, and it helped me realize my that I'm one badass motherfucker when I want to be.

Now that takes us to today. Lately I have been going out to the local bars and have been trying out my new found confidence on some of the ladies, I said fuuccckkk that, and did what I wanted to do(have fun, and chat up some ladies). I ended up k-closing  and number closing a gorgeous girl. Fast forward to last saturday...I was at the bar just chatting with a group of friends and was just having fun. Out of the corner of my eye I see this pretty girl staring me down, so I gestured her with a wave to come over and she does. I chat her up, kino the fuck out it, and use some push-pull techniques to get her to kiss me. So we are just straight making out and she just reaches down my pants and gives me a HJ right in the middle of the fucking bar! Shit was badass, and I was pretty damn sober. She wanted me to take her home, but without the influence of alcohol. 

Just wanted to thank this subreddit for giving me some new found confidence and to tell all the other brothers out there that everyone has the alpha inside of them,False,,t5_2qhrv,False,,,t3_1fli34

I want to share how I earned this position

This is about how to gently achieve *frame control* in an interview

You all know the typical prep stuff (dress nice, research the company, etc) so I won't go into that.

When you interview for a job, and there's a pregnant pause while everyone takes a deep breath, and then: 

""Ok

From that moment on, with you under the spotlight.  We don't want that to happen.  Here's how we set the frame.

Mentally prepare yourself to jump in at that pregnant pause - you want to **be the first one to talk** about yourself.  Don't wait for the questioning to begin.  Start with something like:

""Thanks for meeting with me.  If you don't mind, I have experience with a number of *blah blah blah*... ...""

And then wrap up your introductory speech with

""So, I'm sure you have some questions to ask, would you like to go first?""

This sets up a powerful frame - that you, you establish a high value at the beginning, and then the questions that they will ask you are less about them checking that you're capable, but more congruency tests.  If you lose your nerve, they'll smell it.  So don't.

3)  I get to impress them 3 minutes later by switching to Spanish/Portuguese.  **Your attractive qualities are much more impressive when they come as a slight surprise!**  Speaking in English for a few minutes allows me to play into the ignorant gringo stereotype which I can then break out of.


Anywho . . .


I can tell from that first hug and ensuing eye contact that it’s on from square one.  Not two minutes later though


Guy I came with: “Not her!  God


I look at them both


Me: “Do you know each other?”


Turns out they have friends in common and he has a crush on her.  Disappointed, after a short talk he settles down and gives me the go ahead.  So I go back to the green-eyed Carioca.


The makeout is there straight away and we wander the bar together all night.  Her friend who came with her is a total trooper and puts up with this for like an hour.  


At the end of the night, and agree to meet the next night.'

The next night I feel AWFUL.  My allergies have gone haywire.  Still


We meet at a bar and chill with a group for a while.  It becomes pretty clear everyone has their own agenda.  The single guys want to go to a huge, and pass the fuck out.


I tell the girl:


Me:  “When are we going back to your place?”

She is incredibly motherly and concerned about my allergies.  She doesn’t care that the more time she spends with me the more likely she is to get sick.  And she doesn’t care that kissing me basically puts the nail in her coffin.  It sounds gross


By the time we go back to her place I felt so beat.  We passed out in her twin sized bed without incident.  


I woke up feeling much better.  She invited me to stay with her for the rest of my trip


Aside from her work

You might think this quick hot-and-heavy connecting is just something this girl does all the time.  I can assure you it was not.  She has been with very few guys and in the short interaction with her group of friends I met a bunch of guys who were actively pursuing a relationship with her (to no avail).

1332377138.0,r7mh5,How to Internalize Seduction Concepts,TofuTofu,211,27,47,"Hey guys.

So a question I get a lot is how did I manage to get to the level I'm at? I've always had a bit of trouble explaining it

How I internalized seduction concepts was identical to how I became fluent in a foreign language.

I started studying Japanese in earnest when I was 20 and had moved to Japan. Within a year I was conversationally fluent to the point where I didn't actively think about it much anymore. Within 2 years I was professionally fluent. I had *internalized* the language.

---

**LANGUAGE**

Here's how I did it:

1) **Study lots of material.** Spend 3 hours a day either in class or doing homework/exercises to learn grammar patterns and vocabulary. 

2) **Go out

3) **Do it again the next day

---

**SEDUCTION**

Now check this out... This is how I learned seduction...

1) **Study seduction concepts

2) **Go out as often as humanly possible, it's one of the greatest times you'll ever have in your life.)

3) **Chart your experience** via posting field reports and absorbing insights and advice from the seddit community. Repeat the process night after night

I did this and BAM

Follow these steps and you WILL see dramatic improvements in your social skills. I promise you this. There will be times when it will seem frustrating, identify-altering journey that will turn you into a version of yourself that you didn't know possible. Become awesomeness embodied.

Earlier today I put a [post](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/edj2r/women_of_reddit_how_often_are_you_approached_by/) in /r/AskReddit/ titled ""Women of reddit: How often are you approached by men and how does it make you feel?""

I have been carefully monitoring the results and have drawn a few generalizations which I would like to share. I think it's very important to have a firm grasp on the female experience of pickup

Obviously the reddit userbase skews more towards introverted/nerdy

* Women who are rarely hit on tend to be more appreciative of being approached and are more likely to describe it as flattering as opposed to creepy.
* However
* Attractive women are hit on on nearly a daily basis. They completely reject superficial compliments on their appearance and have many socially uncalibrated chumps and AMOGs throwing awful proposals and compliments in their general direction.
* **To me this completely validates the HB numbering system with how we have to do our approaches regarding social calibration and bitch shields. So nothing new learned
* Many women claim to not want to be approached while running errands (e.g. day game). However when out during the day
* Approaches in neutral venues like cafes and bookstores seem to be quite well received.
* However
* **This tells me that most regular girls don't want to feel like they're just a notch on a headboard. Try and work some of this into your approaches.**
* That being said
* Bringing up sex in the early stages of a pickup is telling your hand a bit too early according to many of the women.
* **I'm not convinced on this one yet
* Girls truly like it when guys can make them laugh in the early stages of an interaction.
* Girls like it even more when they feel a mutual connection over something. E.g. you read the same book or like the same sports team.
* **This tells us that rapport building is critical and must be done at the earliest stages and that laughter is a great way to hook a set early**
* By far the most well received openers are opinion openers and semi-direct ""Hi
* Direct openers ""You're stunning."" will likely flatter a girl with a low self-image but get you stereotyped as just another guy trying to bang an HB7
* Not a single mention of kino. This tells me that when applied properly
* **This is a very good sign IMO.**
* Almost no thoughts/memories of the followup stage between initial encounter and day-2.
* **This tells me that it's almost always determined whether she will call/text you back by the time you finish the interaction (attraction, close). The method you employ to follow up with her should not be so important if you do your approaches right.**
* Well timed and sincere compliments on beauty have a very powerful effect. Their memory can last for years with some women.
* **My initial thought is this is why direct day game is so powerful. I plan to try more of this in field soon
* The ""I have a boyfriend"" excuse is the #1 method of escaping a pickup situation. However a couple girls admit if they find a man exceptionally attractive
* No girls like it when you buy them drinks so stop doing it.
* Remembering girls' names is very important.
* Posture and body language are very important.
* There are a surprisingly alarming number of very nice but low-self-image-having men and women on reddit (and likely in all walks of life.) A lot of PUA is geared towards very beautiful women who get hit on a lot. However for a lot of the casual reformed AFCs here, this could be a very great development for you.

*What other observations and trends can you draw from the thread

It clicked for me because she said something about how girls who sleep with guys on the first date have limited chances for a LTR.  Then I remembered an article I had read on Seddit a few days earlier.  The article talked about how if a girl wants to have an LTR she will likely not sleep with you on the first date (or even the 2nd or 3rd sometimes).  This is because she perceives you as ""boyfriend material.""  I am a very level-headed person

Hey all

Some people have complained that **[AskSeddit](http://reddit.com/r/AskSeddit)** posts don't get enough responses

First

Second

And third

So here are three posts from this week (selected subjectively by me, and IMHO relevance):

Basically, plus she's giving him free cake. 

So what's the problem? Their work schedules aren't aligned

ThrowawayPUA's comment was spot on, stop making it difficult! I wish someone would've also added, **no, don't ask a girl out via Facebook** unless that's really and truly your only option. 

IMHO, do you know when Cute Nurse is working this week? I was hoping to chat but I don't know if we're even here at the same time."" Probably the friend would immediately call Cute Nurse, and they'd make it happen scheduling-wise and then inform OP when and where he's suppose to pick her up.

Would that it were always that easy...

**#2. [Day Game &gt; girl hooked &gt; how to proceed?](http://www.reddit.com/r/askseddit/comments/g2my7/day_game_girl_hooked_how_to_proceed/)**

So AFCAFC gets an awesome response on his second direct approach ever:

&gt;Me: Hi

&gt;Her: (stunned look

...#-closes

His question and the comments mostly focused on the timing (weekend vs. Monday, you should use declarative or imperative sentences, and propose specifics details** (at least the day, and usually also time and location). OP was considering the text ""Drinks? Later?"" which breaks both of those rules. Something more like ""Let's have drinks Thursday"" is way better. If I had seen that post before now I would've contributed those two cents.

AFCAFC

---

**#3. [what change made the biggest difference in your results?](http://www.reddit.com/r/askseddit/comments/g3gn3/ask_seddit_what_change_made_the_biggest/)** [most commented]

This was an intentionally open-ended question that lead to responses like the following (in rough order of upvotes):

* ""I started doing the things I wanted to do.... **I became comfortable being me again**.... I remembered I'm awesome and that if one particular women doesn't want me

* ""**Looking people in the eyes. **Seriously, I prefer looking for too long rather than not enough. If you are creeping her out, you'll know, but if she is into you, the look, then the smile ... makes my day every god damn time! ^_^""

* ""Repeated humiliation. **Once I got shot down about a hundred times, only learning experiences. We learn by our failures, so get busy and get out there and fail. What is important is that you are learning new skills, not that you pull any specific girl. Take care of the process, and the results will follow.""

* ""For me

* ""Learning to **make life about entertaining myself.**""

* ""A bad breakup caused to me to go out and try to get as much random sex as possible. All I needed was **a few fucks and some fuck buddies

That last comment was downvoted actually, but after about 10 lays in my mid-20s, getting laid turned from this existential craving (which makes it hard to avoid oneitis, scarcity mentality, etc.) to a more healthy sort of appetite (which makes it easier to relax and have fun).

1350622221.0,11qe7m,Dear fellow introverts: Introversion is not a handicap.  Stop viewing it that way.,prunck,239,56,57,"A few disclaimers:  I am fairly new to the whole PUA thing, I assure you it wasn't intended that way.  You have a natural advantage in the social department

First, Tom Hanks, Johnny Depp, David Letterman, Lady Gaga... The list is (figuratively) endless.

What is introversion then?  Simply put: Extroverts gain energy by interacting with other people.  Introverts spend energy when interacting with other people.  That is really all there is to it.  After spending extended periods of time with people

One complaint I hear a lot from introverts is ""I don't like the club/bar scene.  I don't want to go to parties.  Therefore, is BS.  Have you ever been to a grocery store?  Have you ever walked down a street that had more than one other person on it?  Have you ever worked in an environment where you don't know absolutely everyone at the company?  If you answered yes to any of these, you could be developing these skills every day.

Remember that time you were at the grocery store, ugly guy, it doesn't even matter) walked into the same aisle near you?  Ask for a recommendation.  Or when you were walking down the street earlier today, and you passed that girl?  Just say hi and smile.  (Was that so hard?)  Or that awkward elevator ride with that guy from another department you don't know.  Make a joke about how slow the elevators are in the office.  You just have to talk to people, it doesn't matter where and it doesn't matter who.  Every interaction is an improvement and a learning experience.

**Introverts have advantages**.  It's true.  Introverts are usually good listeners.  Introverts generally have above average intelligence.  The wittiest and most enjoyable people I've known in my life have mostly been introverts.  You gain energy when you are recharging at home.  Instead of spending that time watching TV, and all the while we are building up energy.  We have a strong ability to focus on things, and are often very passionate in our hobbies, a quality that everyone is attracted to.  We are also often very self reflective and able to understand and analyze our own emotions.

In my opinion

**TLDR** - Post title pretty much sums it up.

1297778031.0,fltg9,Why Guys Struggle Getting Quality Girls. ,MaysonNSS,245,64,113,"I can still remember like it was yesterday getting blown out by the first really hot girl I ever approached. It was a humbling experience and one that is etched in my memory. There comes a time in your learning experience when you try to go for quality rather than quantity and the struggles you face are packed with lessons. The following are some observations taken from my personal journal.


**1) When You See a Girl You Process Your Value Compared to Hers.**


Basically this means that when you see a girl you are sizing her up and then placing a value upon her based in a number of qualities


For the women they too judge appearance but there are so many other factors that play into attraction for them. Instead of the symmetrical qualities that we as guys look for they are much more concerned with the sub communications and if the guy is taking care of himself.  If the guy looks like he took longer to get ready then the woman did then many times they will be turned off. If he looked like he walked out of the forest and hasn’t shaved or showered we all know that


**2) Value is a Filter That Alters Your Perception. **


This aspect is true for guys and for girls, but once you finally got it you could see the actual picture inside it. The first perception was that there was nothing there; upon closer inspection we realize that there was something there and we were deceived at first. 

Value works just like the 3d image. 


**3) She is Sizing You Up Based On….**


To get the girls of exceptional quality one must be valuable to themselves and display value in a way that is congruent with who they are. What I mean by this is since girls respond to value the way we respond to a beautiful girl in a mini-skirt, your personality and how you make her feel. These things are some of the attributes of value. There are other factors like, your style, your attitude and your body language that play pivotal roles as well but value is the entire package that you put together. 



**4) Women Think More Long Term When it Comes to Value. **

Women tend to think about where this will go and what could happen down the road. To display the value that most exceptional girls look for, brains and ambition) you must project your value in a long term setting. Being goal driven in your career and life is something that these rare types of girls will truly be attracted to. This displays a mastery over your sense of self. What this sub communicates about you is that you have a vision for the future and she could share in the fruition of that vision, this excites and stimulates her from a stability perspective. Women tend to pair bond and want relationships so displaying the characteristics that support that is an attractive thing to them.


**5) The Method Behind the Madness**


I know that in this community we tend to have a chip on our shoulder that closing women makes you better at this game and in some ways, worked with major pick up companies and through all that I STILL fail. What makes me succeed where others give up is my passion not to wrack up the most lays but to leave women better then I found them. This principal of giving value is ironically something that goes against the grain of much of the mainstream community ideology. We are taught to neg (lower a woman’s value) we are taught to DHV (demonstrate higher value) and all in attempts to finally get her home and have sex. Sure we all want to have sex but the irony is that the more you make a girl feel that she has value beyond replication she is instinctively drawn to you as a moth is drawn to a flame. 

To get the really quality women takes the right combination of value and elusiveness. You must stay just out of her range NOT out of her league. At the end of the day getting that quality girl is much more about who you believe you are and what you are displaying. It’s also about value

So how did I do it?

First, so it made sense to get some new ones anyway. The new look I had looked way more intense and bad ass than the normal polo shirt and sneakers that I usually wear, and people treated me with high social status because of it, which also helped. I don't want to become dependent on it though so next time I go out to approach girls I'll try to do so using a more normal/casual look, which will actually probably work better since I'll feel more congruent in my regular clothes. I'm also practicing not giving a fuck whenever possible and doing things outside of social norms to help build my core confidence.

Second, just talking to her helped kept me out of my head and in a social mindset.

Finally

After about an hour and a half I was starting to get really hungry and tired of walking around so I decided to just stand outside one of the women's clothing stores and talk to my female friend about whatever came to mind and just wait for a girl to walk out of the store and approach her. After about 5 minutes a cute girl walked by and I thought to myself ""THAT'S THE ONE! RUN FUCKER RUN!"" So I ran past her, this is going to sound really random but I just saw you walking by and thought you looked really nice."" She smiled and said ""thanks"" and kept on walking.

And just like that

1317864939.0,l2h0j,Little changes in behavior that will lead you to become more alpha,,237,56,61,"These are just some off the top of my head that have helped me.

1) Don't be attached to outcome

2) Be decisive. When you have the opportunity to make a decision for the group do it

3) Put energy into an interest. Whatever it may be, read some books on it, etc. You will be a more interesting person

4) Project your voice. Don't be obnoxiously loud but speak clearly and precisely. Don't talk quietly and make a speach out of what you're saying.

5) Don't be sensitive. Embrace criticism

6) Posture. It's damned near impossible to feel insecure about yourself when you walk down the sidewalk/hall/street like you're Vlad the conqueror. Stand with your back against a wall. Make sure that your heels, and walk away holding that position. Learn that and feel what it feels like to stand like that, but in a relaxed way. You shouldn't look like you're exerting any effort to hold that position, but instead that having perfect posture is simply the most comfortable and efficient means of standing and moving for you.

7) Smile when you walk in the room or ""change frames"". It's a simple way to show that you are completely comfortable in that setting

8) Try and have more fun than anybody in any given situation. People love to smile and laugh

9) Don't feel a need to respond to every question

10) Never get too attached to anyone

11) Don't look for fun

12) Be bold without being arrogant

13) Don't judge yourself or others any more than absolutely necessary

14) Stand out without fear. Be the opposite of someone who caters to the masses, tries to make things work for everyone, tries too hard to be perfect, tries too hard for others sake.

I mistakenly posted there instead of seddit but in case you haven't seen it--here's ""my"" **Complete Idiot's Guide to Dancing**.

Disclaimer: By no means am I an authority on breaking it down, on stage at a concert, wherever. Do all this in front of a mirror or when you're cleaning your room to get a feel for it, whatever floats your boat.

**RULES**

*Applicable to all situations*

SMILE. If you don't have a silly grin on your face when you're dancing

ENJOY YOURSELF. Don't see dancing as a method to get laid. Have fun doing it. Feel the music and your body moving. Sounds corny but dancing is awesome. If you're going to do it you might as well have fun.

**GUIDE TO DANCING ALONE**

*STEP 1*

You've probably seen it in all the movies and heard it when you were in 7th grade

*STEP 2*

Good start

*STEP 3*

Incorporate the hips! If you've ever playfully (violently?) side-bumped a girl while you were walking down the street you know how to move your hips.

*STEP 4*

Take a few steps! Back and forth, then get on your toes. When Shout comes on, get your ass to the grass! This song is the easiest way to establish attraction with someone else in a group. You're low on the ground, staring at each other, dancing...fuck how much easier could it be??

NOW YOU KNOW HOW TO DANCE! Never more will you be the creeper dude who just stands there nodding his head and staring at girl's breasts. Hopefully.

**THE APPROACH**

Always, GO GO GO. Then you back it out a little and grab a girl's hand. DOESN'T MATTER WHO. The uglier the better.

In smaller groups, right? Even if they're guys?) look over your shoulder, draw eye contact with the girl behind you, and start dancing while still looking over your shoulder. Give her a smile while you wriggle closer. Make an introduction between her group and yours, then get on it!

**DANCING WITH SOMEONE ELSE**

Now you're dancing with someone else. First things first

**DO A SPIN. BITCHES LOVE SPINS.**

Here is your repertoire of spin moves
Basic one-handed spin. Just grab her left hand with your right (or vice versa) and lift it. She'll do the rest. Why is it important that you grab her left with your right? So there's no confusion over the direction!

* Reverse spin. Immediately follows your basic spin. Right after you complete your spin
* Half spin. Initiate as with a typical spin, you can step to the side and catch her across the back of her waist with your right hand. Now it's like you're standing next to each other, your right hand holding her waist and your left hand holding her right hand across her body. Feel free to lean back, flash a smile, go in for a kiss, etc.
* Two handed half spin. Shit's getting real now. Grab both her hands with your own and raise your left arm (her right), your hands are around her, and you start grinding from behind. This has multiple advantages: this hand-crossed position makes her feel sexy and intimate, and you get to grind on her booty!

When not spinning feel free to grab her hands and just swing them around and stare into each other's eyes cackling wildly. Live

**GRINDING**

*Front grind*

If she's into it

Since you're locked into position, start putting your face closer and closer to hers. If she maintains eye contact with you rather than looking away, you know you're close to making out.

*Rear grind*

Use the double hand move transition to go rear. Much more flexibility in this position. Run your hands up and down her waist / leg / butt / breasts (in that order

OK I think that's all I have for y'all tonight. Take this. Use it. Own it. (Sticky it?). Feel free to add opinions

1298088069.0,fobhj,Lesson 1: Primer on Being a Modern Alpha Male,TofuTofu,243,64,75,"Hi guys.

I'm here to talk to you today about what being a modern alpha male entails. This

**CHARACTERISTICS OF A MODERN ALPHA MALE**

* **1) Be a leader of men**

People should look to you as a leader. You lead by example. You set the tone for the night. When there's any doubt about what the next move should be

* **2) Be firm in your values**

You have meditated and thought about your deepest inner values. You are unwavering on these. These can include things as basic as love of life, religion, or not tolerating condescension or self-defeating behavior. These are the basic pieces that make up your personality and it is important to know what they are. The average, beta male has trouble describing his personal values to others. He looks to others to define who he is. This will not be you. YOU will define who you are. Nobody else.

* **3) Be self-validated**

You do not need the validation of others to define your confidence. You can get ""in state"" from energy generated purely from within. You don't look to others for approval because you KNOW you're an all-star. You're AWESOME and every fiber of your being knows it. You will not be knocked out of state in the field because nothing can harm your ego. You are awesomeness embodied. Settle for nothing less.

* **4) Be non-reaction seeking &amp; non-reactive**

How someone reacts to your behavior is not particularly important to you. You are self-validated and emanate awesomeness. You are positive

* **5) Have social proof and preselection**

Everywhere you go

* **6) Be a value giver (and not a value taker)**

You do not NEED approval from others. Approval is something a high value individual doles out to others. Receiving approval is taking value. Seeking approval is being a value taker. YOU dole out the approval. YOU are approached by value takers. YOU are a value giver. Every person you encounter in your life is better off for having met you. Whether it's just a wave hello to a stranger, you're enriching the lives of others. You are benevolent and compassionate. You look out for and protect the people in your life.

* **7) Be fun**

Everywhere you go, teasing, and spontaneous with the women in your life. People want to be with you and be blessed with the value emanating from your pores.

* **8) Don't be creepy &amp; make sure to dress/groom well**

As a modern, you will avoid creepy or stalkerish behavior. These are not congruent with an alpha male.

Everyone studying seduction on this board should give serious considering towards living their life to become the embodiment of these eight points.

1370290986.0,1flqnw,"The real reason girls flake on you, and how to prevent it",rmbarnes,236,56,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/1flqnw/the_real_reason_girls_flake_on_you_and_how_to/, and is considered one of the most annoying aspects of the game by many PUAs.

The community gives us a lot of advice on how to combat flaking. The most common methods given to prevent it are as follows:

Build more comfort. This technique assumes that the girl is attracted to you but
Get her to invest more. Investment is basically where she puts in a lot of the work into the interaction
Time bridging. Old school Mystery Method. This is when you make the date (ie agree on a time and place) during the initial pickup, the future projection of you two on the date makes her more comfortable with going.
Spend more time in set with her. This is very similar to 1) and 2). Longer sets simply make for more solid numbers because they make her more comfortable and she talks to you more.
Better text game. Teasing can be used to build attraction
While I think all of these these points can help to some degree

Girls flake on you because you are not attractive enough for them

I know many people will disagree with this. They’ll say, life circumstances, really retarded text game and lack of comfort can all cause flakes. I do, however, believe that these cause a small minority of flakes. This is why I say the five points listed above are only optimizations. If you were to get these points down perfectly your flake rate would drop, but probably by at most 10%.

The second part of my rebuttal deals with the nature of attraction itself. Whenever someone in the PUA community says they “had attraction”, but once there is attraction it can vary in it’s intensity (setting 10 would be really high volume). Attraction is essentially an emotion, and all emotions vary in intensity. Take anger. If some one bumps into you carelessly in a bar you’d be angry. If someone rapes and murders your sister, you’d also be angry. Obviously the intensity of the anger would massively vary in the two different scenarios.

To really drive this point home

&lt;HB4: No attraction
HB5: Wouldn’t take her on a date
HB6: Would almost certainly take her on a date, and if I still hadn’t fucked her that’d be it. I’m getting to the point where I might not even go on dates with girls of this level anymore. Since first date lays are rare (they’re usually on week nights which make it hard, and I think girls just aren’t that likely to fuck on a first date unless they’re really DTF or really into you in a big way), it’s getting pointless for me. Wouldn’t consider a relationship for a girl of this standard.
HB7: Would go on multiple dates (been on up to five) with a girl this attractive. Would want to see her again after fucking her unless I really hated her personality.
HB8: Multiple dates, unless her personality is intolerable.
HB9: Never number closed a girl this hot.
The point is this. A woman can be somewhat attracted to you (for example she kisses you in a club after a couple of drinks)

The reason I think this to be true is that for me, whether I time bridged, how far I escalated don’t seem to have much, if any impact on whether a girl will flake or not. It breaks down a lot like this:

HB5 and below: I don’t number close these girls.
HB6: Rarely flake. Maybe a 10% flake rate. Sometimes they even text me first.
HB7: It’s 50/50 as to whether I’ll get her out on a date.
HB8: Usually flakes. I’d guess an 80%+ flake rate
HB9: Never number closed.
This fits in nicely with the idea of the differences between a man and womens sexual market value (SMV) being the main deciding factor in how attracted one person is to another person. Since girls are hypergamous they have a strong preference for a man at least one point higher than them on the SMV scale. This is the minimum most girls believe they deserve, on my level are hoping for better so often flake. The 6s have their sights firmly set on a guy like me so never flake.

So how to avoid flakes? Raise your SMV or hit on uglier women. Your SMV is the total package you present to a girl as man. It is a sum of your value plus your game. If you want to stop the hotter girls flaking you need to:

Work on your game. Open lots of sets
Work on your value. Gym. Fashion. Grooming. Career. Lifestyle.

1320810019.0,m5o6b,"""We"": The Single Greatest IOI I Know",Coover,205,23,32,"I wish I could find an article to back up what I'm saying but this just comes from experience. Let me tell a few stories. If you want the TL;DR it will be in bold at the bottom.

**Story 1**: A while back I was driving out from my college to a friend's party out at their parents' farm. The drive was already lengthy and was made even more so by the fact that the driver I was with got incredibly lost. There was the driver, pretty much chilling and trying to not disappear off into the woods forever. To pass the time we started talking about the driver's new boyfriend, and Janice and I start giving the driver shit, turning everything she said into a dirty joke. Janice was laughing at all my stupid jokes, copying my mannerisms when she delivered her own jokes, all solid IOIs by themselves. But then somewhere inside that conversation, in the quiet following a pretty huge laugh-session, Coover""**. Later that evening the whole party was abuzz with the rumor that Janice was feeling something for me. Were it not for complicated romantic conditions at the time I would've acted.

**Story 2**: While I was traveling down South I wound up about 3 hours away from a long-distance, well, I had it in my head that she was way out of my league. But when we finished drinking and started walking back to where I was crashing, Jane laughed at a joke I make in reference to a book and jokingly said (as she grabbed my shoulder) **""Oh, Coover. It's so nice to have someone smart to talk to. We are so much better than everyone else in this town!""**. An hour later we were making out.

**Story 3**: Out at a bar with friends, that I'd been friends with for a long time. Recently, however, I noticed feelings were changing. I started noticing her in a more sexual way, and she'd been making several comments recently about how much my appearance had changed and how good I looked (again, solid IOI). But it was the ""We"" statements in front of other friends that made me think there was more going on: **""Coover and I have been friends for a long time. We have done so much together and we have always been there for each other""**. That night we made out.

**Theory: When a Woman Stops Talking About ""I"" or ""You"" and Starts Talking About ""We"", look for compatibility in potential sexual partners. A way they subconsciously express this desire for compatibility, and how they try to plant this idea of compatibility in **your** head and in **friends'** heads is through the use of **""We"" Statements**.

There are lots of IOIs that I've gotten good at noticing through experience but this is the one common one out of all my recent hook-ups, seems to indicate that they are ready to go there and then, as soon as you get a private moment with them. 

Of course you don't need to wait for the lady to start using ""We"" statements. Start using them yourself to plant the idea in **her** head. A few strategically placed ""We"" statements in a conversation will take all the tension to the next level.

We is powerful. Or is it ARE powerful?

**TL;DR: You will know she is attracted to you when she stops saying ""I"" or ""You"" and starts saying ""We"". Your primary goal in psychological seduction is to escalate things to ""We""-talk.**

I don't get paid to teach and I haven't written any books. However! I have been VERY successful over the years using the methods I will describe to you. This is NOT 'perfect' or 'textbook' game but I have field tested these theories on my own time and have consistently well with them.

**Introduction**: This guide will TRY to steer away from specific

**What is Long Term and Social Circle Game?** Both of these terms refers to sleeping with girls that you have known for awhile or at least well after your first encounter. Except that Social Circle Management can have really solid tie ins with single-night F-Closes. More on that later.

**Long Term Game** This is all I know how to call it. There may be a better term for it but this one is mine so you get to deal with it for now! Long Term Game does NOT help us for random encounters in the club. Keep to your Seddit 101s for that stuff. This does however work wonders for co-workers, that cute girl at the cash register you see twice a week, etc etc. Any regular interaction.

A) The key to this is to be entirely unflappable. I know rejection is hard to handle and you can cry into your pillow afterward if you want but as far as public opinion is concerned, hence turning it into a 'hard rejection', one that you can never come back from. And 2. This sets you up for potential future action with the first girl and keeps your image solid for your social circle. All good things.

B) Do NOT rush progress with your targets. If you go full speed on a co worker and fail

I'm a server at a restaurant. I show value through story telling, I'm NEVER sick (That they know of) and I'm VERY public with my sexuality. Showing value is a standard Seduction skill and wont be covered here. The only difference is you don't have a time limit on showing your value, you simply have to display it consistently and you will reap the benefits over time. 

C) DISPLAY YOUR SEXUALITY! This is VERY important because you want people to identify you as a sexual person. This makes sure that the 'friendzone' curse never fully takes root. There are many ways to do this while ALSO showing value. You can tell a story about a 'good friend you used to sleep with' where you guys were fooling around in public and almost got caught! Oh man! Good times! Stories like these show that you are able to sleep with your friends

Brunette Girl: LiveBreatheOwn
LiveBreatheOwn: Ha

This small bit of dialogue does wonders. In HER mind: I am a sexual person and I DO hook up and am ABLE to hook up because it's clear this customer finds me attractive. I have standards and I just happen to prefer girls with her hair color that have intelligence. So when the time DOES come to close the deal

**Social Circle Management**: This coincides with long term game in the sense that you don't reap the benefits right away. What this will do is provide for you a support system that will get you laid even without them knowing they are your support system. They will be your thralls and not even be aware of it.

A) Create NON-SEXUAL Value within your circle

Friend: ""Hey Stephanie this is my friend LiveBreatheOwn
LiveBreatheOwn: ""I'm not sure what he's talking about

I chose this dialogue because no matter what I say, she will know you can dance regardless of what you say. And later on in the night when I pull out a few dance moves, I've already skipped over Intro / Transition and I've built a ton of attraction. Nothing left to do but swoop in and seal the deal.

B) ""It takes 10 times as many resources to gain a new customer as it does to retain an existing one."" My old mentor told me this one time when referring to business but I immediately applied this to my Social Circle Game. DO. NOT. BURN. BRIDGES. Keep your 'customers' close and USE them! I've been sleeping with a group of 4 or 5 girls since HIGH SCHOOL (Multiple years ago) and never have I burned bridges with them. When they would get a boyfriend, the other is single. Do not be offended when they date other people and comfort them in their times of jealousy and make sure they know they are special to you.

C) Word of mouth is the best form of publicity. This goes back to prequalification but it extends over a longer period of time. My social circle KNOWS I am a sexual person, ""Hey I was talking to my friend about sex and how she needs a fuck buddy so I told her about you, can I give her your number?""

So here I am, drama free, high quality sexual partner to refer to her friends.

I don't think that every thought i have is necessarily 100% correct, so as with all things you read on here, you should take this with a grain of salt. Take what helps and discard the rest

**The ""Alpha-Male""**

A lot of people have their own definitions. None of these are necessarily inherently wrong. A lot of people also have certain requirements that constitute their definition of an Alpha

So what is alpha to me? It's simple: An alpha is any man who is themselves, rather than just relaxing. The fact of the matter is that a lot of these things you learn in the community will flow somewhat naturally if you can learn to be yourself, and make no apologies for that.

I find that the best way to achieve this for me, tell her your random thoughts, be your quirky self. Do whatever you would do if it actually was her. Be unapologetic about it. We're guys. Half the shit that goes through our head makes no sense. But let me tell you, guys: you're better off telling her you're thinking about how many twix bars you could eat before you die, than trying to play it cool. Goofy is OK and very beneficial in moderation. Humor loosens people up.

I'd like to say more but I don't want to over-complicate this simple message.

tl;dr let your thoughts flow and don't be apologetic about it.

**Confidence-Building**

I want to talk you guys through an exercise. This exercise isn't some miracle cure that will solve your problems overnight. But what it will do is that if you're still having trouble with confidence it may help you to identify your insecurities

This is a little embarrassing for me

The other day I was sitting at work, and I was complaining to her about how I felt about things, about insecurities or what have you. I thought about what I wished I could hear from somebody that cared about me. I realized that if I had a loving girlfriend, I would love for her to tell me that I wasn't alone, I wasn't weird, I could handle school, I could handle a career, that I was worth loving

Then I had a sort of epiphany, why couldn't I feel these things about myself? So for the first time in my life, I was sitting there at work with nobody around and I said to myself out loud (and really really meant it) ""I know you'll make a good father, I know you can do it and that's all you need"" (because becoming a father is something that's always scared me personally.)

Anyways, then trust me you CAN tell yourself the same thing and it will have no less effect. It's just a matter of getting yourself to actually feel it. If you can tell yourself these things just ONE time, and really mean it then it will change everything.

Now this may be lame, next to a beautiful girlfriend who is crazy about you. Imagine you're complaining to her, and you're feeling like total shit. Imagine she is crazy in love with you and is telling you all the right things, making you feel so much better about yourself. What is she telling you? (If it helps, for reference to yourself and others, feel free to list them here) Write these things down. Find a way to feel these things about yourself. Some may not take long, others may take some work. Every time you cross one off the list you'll feel like a new man.

If you can knock a lot of these out, because I've only really crossed off maybe 2 of the things on my quite long list. But with every increase in my confidence, my head races a little bit less around people. I am a little more calm, a little more un-reactive, and a little more attractive. It's almost like a super-power to those of us who have never felt it before.

tl;dr This one I want you to read

In an effort to tie these things all together

The short answer: whatever the fuck you want. Say you're in class sitting next to a girl you're interested in. Imagine that girl is the girl you're friends with but not attracted to. What would you say if she was? Say that. What you say doesn't matter. If you're thinking about damn... i dunno... pillows, because you've already given them to yourself. The power of just being yourself un-apologetically is unbelievable.

I was going to write an awesome post about alpha body language and tonality as a follow up to [this.](http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/fobhj/lesson_1_primer_on_being_a_modern_alpha_male/)

Without further ado:

---

**35 WAYS TO CONVEY VALUE**
 
(1) **Non-submissive eye contact**
-no darting of the eyes when you look at her
contact first.
 
(2)  **Vocal Projection**
-the loudest guy in a group is usually the most comfortable
unstifled
 
(3) **Commanding and Challenging (Breaking Rapport) Tonality**
-commanding authoritative tonality puts you in the same category as 
other high value people.

it gets her to respond in a qualifying tone
she rationalizes that she must like you because she only talks with 
people like that if they are high value.
 
(4)  **Unreactivity**
-not socially pinging off of the girl.  Your state is not dependent 
on her reaction to you. Be the yacht.
 
(5)  **Who's reacting to who more**
-who's laughing quicker at the others jokes
conversation
other.  The one reacting more is lower value
 
(6)  **Who's more in their head
-this is the same as above but internally
words gets her trying to piece together the conversation.  The more 
non sequitar
you are saying
 
(7)  **Lead the conversation**
-you have control of what is being said.  I call it channeling the 
river
interaction forward as opposed to just being a little bitch and 
talking about whatever just so you can keep the conversation alive.
 
(8)  **Good body language**
-when you feel comfortable and confident you are naturally going to 
take up more space and have good body language
it is important to have a larger...
 
(9)  **Physical presence**
-guys that are alpha just take up more space.  You can see in a 
group the most alpha guy might have 2-3 feet of space between him 
and the next guy
very little space.  This is also noticeable in how much physical 
movement you use
 
(10)  **Bringing your state from within**
-similar to 4 and 5
to pump your emotional state
awesomeness
around you as well.  This relates to...
 
(11)  **Self amusement**
-the opposite of self amusement is reaction seeking.  Reaction 
seeking is neediness and a low value trait.  Self amusement is 
purely for your own enjoyment because you don't care about anyone 
else and just bathe in your own awesomeness
reactions to make yourself feel good.
 
(12)  **Stating your opinion**
-a high value person is more likely to state their opinion
because it comes from them
doesn't think anyone cares what they have to say.
 
(13)  **Statements not questions**
-statements are always more authoritative than questions
knows
looks like a nurse and she is
two met.
 
(14)  **Lowering the bar for what you talk about**
-again vomit words.  The more bullshit things you say
conveys that you don't care about the interaction
response to what you say.  It shows that you talk to girls like her 
all the time
 
(15)  **Conveying intent**
 -by showing that you aren't afraid to convey intent
you are willing to be vulnerable and put your personality on the 
line
comfortable doing.
 
(16)  **Commanding attention**
-don't compromise your value just to keep her talking.  If she isn't 
looking at you
A high value person assumes that when he is talking people listen.  
If there is a dissonance
 
(17)  **Being as comfortable
-no leaning in to hear her
comfortable
as you
 
(18)  **Entitlement**
-you feel entitled to the girl.  You fully assume that she is yours
and you are not emotionally affected by any response she has towards 
you either positive or negative.  The byproduct of this is...
 
(19)  **Indifference**
-again
This conveys a level of abundance
have other girls
 
(20)  **Lack of outcome dependence**
- 18 and 19 explain why you have no emotional reaction to anything 
she says
 
(21)  **Authentic conversation**
-I talked about this last week in the spectrum of authenticity 
article.  The more authentic and real you are
you are and the more balls it takes.
 
(22)  **Full frontal positioning**
-none of that old skool bullshit about body rocking and over the 
shoulder openers.  Go in direct, 
and make yourself vulnerable.
 
(23)  **Passing shit/congruence tests**
-Alex used to say that 80% of ""natural"" game is passing congruence 
tests

remember congruence tests are more than the obvious ""Is that your 
pickup line?!"" there are also the more subtle ones like not making 
good eye contact
the beginning of an interaction.  The best way to respond is by...
 
(24)  **Being unapologetic**
-when you go through life by your own standards
please people
shit,you tell them to pay 
attention.  This is because...
 
(25)  **Don't identify yourself based on other peoples opinions**
-do you see how these are byproducts of each other
overlapping?  This is why it is all so powerful
beliefs
 
(26)  **Escalation**
-more leading here.  Having that detachment from the outcome to the 
point where you aren't emotionally affected if you go to escalate 
and don't get it.
 
another way of saying this is to cultivate an...
 
(27) **Abundance mindset**
-now I've had my fair share of virgins on bootcamp
ask how they can have an abundance mindset if they obviously aren't 
doing very well in the success with women category.
 
but it's not abundance directly with women
fact that you have trust in your skillset to get another girl if it 
doesn't work out with the one in front of you.
 
(28)  **Congruence**
-who's frame is stronger

whoever holds the frame unwaveringly wins
how they act
 
(29)  **Non-judgemental**
-being judgmental of her sluttiness
is a sign of naivety and of someone who hasn't seen much of the 
world or experienced life.
 
this is why travel is a great way to develop a stronger frame
experience makes you much more...
 
(30)  **Comfortable in your own skin**
-this is also why as you get older
yourself
life
you deal with it accordingly
 
(31)  **Walking through the world with ease**
-someone that has his shit together isn't going to be stressed.  
Betas are stressed in life
aren't the alpha
the good life.
 
(32)  **Standing out
-society conditions us to be average
stripey shirts
 
(33)  **Being comfortable with silence**
-not feeling like you need to keep talking if you have nothing to 
say
the conversation stops for a moment
remember how cool you are.
 
(33)  **Dominance**
-what is dominance?  The opposite is submission
proactively leading the interaction leads to her submitting
that you can show that you aren't afraid to take a risk is by...
 
(34)  **Leading**
-to lead is to take a risk
to the bar, someone 
not comfortable with themselves
 
(35)  **Assuming attraction**
-there is inherent social proof based on how you interact with the 
girl.  If you are interacting with her in a way that you are 
assuming she likes you
like her usually like you as well.",,t5_2qhrv,True,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/fphve/lesson_2_alpha_body_language_tonality_and_more/
1359914573.0,17tdbr,"[FR] House party, social proof, and a f-close",,243,38, 60 at peak) and even less girls. Not the most conducive environment to pick up in

Probably the most important part of this night was that I was just going to the party to have a good time and wing for my friend. I wasn't dependent on getting a girl

Started off by catching up with an old friend (HB6) and visibly having a good interaction with her. I was giving her shit about how she is so old (24 to my 22) and can't even do shots any more. Ended up doing 2 shots with her

Some time passes,

HB8: Can I have a (some mix drink)?

Me: (Acting offended) Wow

Her: Well

Me: (slight pause) Good point. What's your name?

Conversation then lasts for a minute or two with me just playing around with her, good to go. This further served a point because everyone else coming up to the bar saw me interacting with her, which established some good social proof.

Flash forward a bit later and my buddy is going for this HB8. But she is with a HB7 and I walk by, still standing in the same place. I make eye contact with the HB7 from really far away, and hold it the entire time as I walk up. She does one of the quick glimpses down as though to check me out, and from this I decided to just be quick about it. I ask if she wants to dance, offering my hand. She agrees and we dance and talk for a few songs. She's giving off some strong signals that she wants me, so I go straight for a kiss. Make out on the dance floor for a bit, then once the song ends I tell her I have to go to the bathroom.

I go to my buddy's room for a bit and hang low for a few minutes. I leave the room and nearly immediately find the HB7. I smile and ask if she wants to go back to my place, and all is good.

The key to this being successful was establishing myself as high value from the beginning. I wasn't going hard for any women, and fun to establish good impressions with both the girl I was conversing with and whoever witnessed the conversation. By building a solid social reputation at the house party with everyone, it made my job much easier whenever I was talking to any individual. Heck, it made my work with the HB7 almost too easy (and I was assured that she is anything but).

1. fake it until you become it is a good mantra but you must be your own alpha, than trying to be alpha.

2. don't look for peoples approval. The entire time this guy was dancing and doing push ups he was looking around to see if people were watching him and showed a complete lack of self confidence.

My plan was to go in and escalate till rejection. Well I was stupid and forgot about the date and stood her up. She was mad.

A week later

I start talking to a group of Italians (two guys three girls) and start gaming the girls in front of the guys. One of the guys loves it and says I have balls and that I should go for his friend. I start escalating quickly and I try to kiss her. Rejected

Oneitis shows up, pull her in, then push her away, do this for a while then pull her in and try to kiss her. Rejected. She says she wants to but she got back with her ex (she broke up with him 2 months ago). She asks me if it's ok if we just stay as friends. I say yes because I actually enjoy her company. 

I was disappointed and a bit mad to say the least. But instead of going home feeling dejected, I never give her a straight answer before a tease her a bit. I also escalate kino quickly, hands on arms, grab her hands, then her waist, then her thights, then her neck etc.

I grab her hand and tell her we're going to dance. This must have looked hilarious because grinding on her was a chore (she's way too tall). We dance for a bit, and kiss her. All this was happening in front of Oneitis and her face showed that she wasn't pleased (although I honestly didn't plan to rub it in her face or anything, it just happened). We break apart for a bit.

Around 20 minutes later, push her towards the bar and continue to kiss her (it started getting messy and really touchey) so I asked her ""Do you want to come over"".
She stared at me for a good minute, give her my phone, she puts her # in. As she leave's she grabs me by the neck and pulls me into a short makeout and then leaves.

I go to get my coat, we talk for 4 minutes. I tell her we should get drinks next week. She says she can't because she has a boyfriend. Italian guy from the beginning of the night finds me again as I'm waiting at coat check. He says You're awesome, give me your Facebook, and we should go hit on girls together sometime.

1318716286.0,ldip7,Lessons learned from my first months of seduction.,cytus,228,51,21,"My mindset has changed a lot since I've started with pickup. Here's what I learned so far.  


---------------------------------------------------------------
**Seduction is a practical approach to get women.**

---------------------------------------------------------------
There is no magic bullet. If you want something

Seduction techniques can be used for so much more. I've successfully seduced my boss when I messed up and I got the chance to meet a lot of different people. 95% responded positively to a cold approach. I help my new contacts and they help me. Seduction made me become a better conversationalist. It helped me reconnect with old friends. Outcome independence taught me to be a value giver instead of a value taker.   


---------------------------------------------------------------
**She must like the person I am.**

---------------------------------------------------------------
I will constantly improve myself. I'm a really bad dancer. I look like a blindfolded mule on acid on the dancefloor (I'm likely not exaggerating). These things don't come natural to me


---------------------------------------------------------------
**That girl is out of my league.**

---------------------------------------------------------------
How can I be sure if I don't approach?  


---------------------------------------------------------------
**I can't approach because I need to find the perfect opener first.**

---------------------------------------------------------------
There is no perfect opener. In fact


---------------------------------------------------------------
**She's busy. I can't approach.**

---------------------------------------------------------------
That's an excuse. Most of the time, type ""hello"" and show her. She's reading a bus plan? Tell her when the next bus will arrive. Whatever. Dude, live is short. You might never see her again. If you don't approach, she won't either. You don't feel ready? You'll never be. Nobody will officially approve your *readiness*. Doing the next step is always risky - that's part of the fun. Nobody cares if you fail. It sounds strange but some might even admire you for having the guts to approach her.  


---------------------------------------------------------------
**I have to create comfort before physical contact.**

---------------------------------------------------------------
No. Don't make a big deal out of it. The moment you feel comfortable touching her


---------------------------------------------------------------
**Oops! She has a boyfriend. I'll leave her alone.**

---------------------------------------------------------------
She *says* she has a boyfriend. Let's find out if it's a shit test. Keep your frame. You only want to meet interesting people


---------------------------------------------------------------
**I have her number. She likes me.**

---------------------------------------------------------------
Getting her number is only a tiny step. She gives it to the plumber. You should never settle for mediocracy. Try to go further after having the number.  


---------------------------------------------------------------
**I will cherish and indulge her for the rest of my life.**

---------------------------------------------------------------
Yes. Do that...after you had sex with her. This has nothing to do with being an asshole or a womanizer. The problem here is that she must under all circumstances see you as a possible lover not a caretaker in the beginning. This will make things so much easier in the long run. You can move on to make a physical connection and if she rejects you


---------------------------------------------------------------
**I'm moving too fast.**

---------------------------------------------------------------
That's highly unlikely. She will tell you, every bit of smalltalk will lower your chances. Everybody is bored by it. Avoid it like a desease. If you don't bond with her on an emotional level during the first two minutes, your intentions are not clear and the discussion will feel awkard. The most important thing is calibration. If she's shy, try an honest compliment to bring her out of her shell. She's throwing a shit test? Try cocky funny and keep your frame. Playing Gentleman or Bad Boy depends on the situation.  


---------------------------------------------------------------
**If she stops me

---------------------------------------------------------------
Nah


---------------------------------------------------------------
**Getting rejected is painful.**

---------------------------------------------------------------
No. It's normal. She hasn't rejected your personality


---------------------------------------------------------------
**I will never find another woman as pretty/intelligent/friendly as her.**

1271097927.0,bpx0p,Exercise: Touch everyone you talk to,intjpua,204,27,65,"Being a recovering introvert and nerd, I've been doing a job that has me occasionally meeting hundreds of people in a single day

Turns out, it lowers their blood pressure and increases their serotonin levels, making them happier and more relaxed. Google ""touch and serotonin"" if you have doubts. This increase in happiness makes getting a smile or a laugh out of someone *much* easier and it increases the level of trust between you.

I'm not sure about the science regarding its effect on the person doing the touching, it just didn't go anywhere and she seemed a bit surly), and I think it came down to me being more nervous and less confident without the touch since she was on the other side of the bar and I was seated, so there was no natural way to add touch to the interaction. Of course, my inability to make a great conversation with her (even with the social proof of already being with girls) without the crutch of being able to touch her is something I'll work on, but I'm definitely not going to give up touch whenever it is possible.

What I've noticed is that it works everywhere and with every conversation. So, restaurant greeter, people I meet on the street, male or female), I will briefly touch their shoulder, arm, or back with a soft open palm. It fits very comfortably into almost every conversation. Wherever you would say, or when you playfully tease someone, that's awesome!"" simply touch whatever non-threatening part of them (upper arm, just make sure you're already in a reasonable position to do so before you start the conversation. This doesn't require significant effort; any position of comfortably talking to someone will allow easy access to a shoulder or their back...don't get too close to the hands

If you're in an already social environment, and start talking. Once the first few words are out, remove your hand and relax (PUA advice always says ""lean away"", but that seems to result in unnatural looking behavior in people I've seen follow it; be natural and relaxed and you'll do the right thing...which isn't necessarily to lean away or to lean in).

This single change in my behavior has increased my social ability more than any piece of advice or routine or line. It is incredibly powerful. The more I use it

Here's some amazing stuff that's happened in the past year, staff give discounts that don't actually apply to me without even being asked, and, of course, girls like me better and I find I'm much more frequently able to attract and interest them.

One recent example of this, while smiling and in party mode: ""So what's going on tonight? Is it awesome? Really? (touch) Would *you* come see this show if you weren't working? Alright, I think I'm sold, but what's the cover? (touch a slightly different spot)"" I imagine the fact that I was with two cute girls might have had a bearing on the discount, but I went back the next night with another guy and the door guy remembered me and offered me the same deal of one cover for both of us. Even better, the fact that the door guy called inside that the next group was getting in for one cover provided social proof to the absolutely gorgeous girl taking the money. I was able to instantly get a conversation going with her, IOIs were flying and she checked me out every time she walked by that night (again, so that totally helps

Since I never can learn anything without examples, but I can't stop."" ""OK, but it does stop at 13th, right?"" ""Yes"" ""OK, (I look outside) I guess it's mostly stopped raining, I can walk."" He mumbles a sort of apology. (touch shoulder) ""It's no problem man, a little walking isn't going to hurt me."" About a mile from the stop I wanted he turned to me, ""You wanted 7th right? I'll stop if nobody's watching."" And, ""Thank you much

I mentioned there I was heading out today to the local park to press on with my 100 set challenge. I'm only 14 sets in, so hopefully you guys can get some use out of this too.

So

[Low Energy Daytime Approach](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnOYxQnwOzk)

[A Daygame Approach Using an Assumptive Opener](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHQJezaGWuQ)

[Direct Daygame Makeout](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpQFariMc68)

I decided to try two things: The low energy approach and to just go ahead and push everything that little bit further than I otherwise might.

So I get into the centre and it's off to a bad start. The EDL (English Defence League, but the city centre was dead. People were being advised to stay at home for fear of riots.

Then in the middle of an almost empty high street is a well dressed

I approach from the side

""So

I smile, tall, wide, and still. I stand my ground throughout the interaction.

She smiles and shakes her head.

""So why the fancy camera?""

""I'm just a tourist""

""Oh

""I'm from Finland

""Really? my mother is from Helsinki""

She lights up and does a cute bounce up and down.

""Really!?""

""Yeah

""A few weeks""

""I hope you enjoy yourself

I hold out my hand

""My name is Matt""

""Marri"" she says

I hold her hand for just a little longer than normal

""Lovely to meet you

I wink

I continue on, things I could've acted on and done. But I'm not that bothered. Remember how before starting PUA you would see that one hot girl on the bus or in the street who stuck out more than everyone else? You would just go about your life never knowing who she was, why she was there. This was one of those moments for me where for the first time in my life, I could say I had approached that woman - the one that stood out from the rest - and it felt amazing in it's own right. Progress, I thought. I was happy.

10 minutes pass, around slightly and out of the other entrance down a ramp, when I see Marri again, leaning against the ramp, watching the police. This was a sign, fate had given me another shot to follow my own advice and really push things further than normal.

I went right up to her

""I think you're following me"" I say with a smile.

She looked at me and smiled

""Matt
So why all of the police here? I saw one put a guy in car"" (Her english is adorable)

""Oh, while looking her in the eyes again.

She turns

""Who are the English Defence League""

I swept her hair aside from her ear

""They're racists""

She giggled

""You'll be fine though"" I said while putting my hand against her back briefly

A conversation starts and I asked her all sorts, turns out she living in a city nearby and works as an au pair, she's come into my city twice now and this is the second time. I put my arm around her and pull her in to me.

""I'll be your guide""

She stays there. I now have my arm around her and I stay silent for a moment so she can take in what I've just done.

""So Matt

She asks me about my family, asking where I grew up, etc. I'm telling her stories of how I got lost in Helsinki and ended up sleeping on a bench, telling her about my British home town which happens to be right next to where she works. She starts expressing disbelief at the coincidence of it all (all of which are true) and enjoying the fact that randomness has brought us together.
I get my phone out, and without saying anything, I hand her my phone.

""Sorry I don't give my number to strangers""

""I don't give my phone to strangers. You're not a stranger

She's still a bit reluctant.

""Besides, you know""

She thinks for a moment

I held my hand out

""Marri

She smiles a huge grin and tries to hide her face. I give her a hug

""Catch you later Marri""  

I walk off.


So, I could sense much less awkwardness in this interaction than in my last ones, I made an effort to push forward, and escalate kino quickly on the second interaction and I think these two things combined are what really glued the whole thing together.

A little bit later I approached another 4 sets with the same style

1370004327.0,1fefjb,How To Score A Threesome,alexmatlock,302,130,51,"I’ve had my fair share of girl-girl-guy threesomes. I’ve had the guy-guy-girl too but that’s not nearly as much fun. This article will explain the two best ways to get a girl-girl-guy threesome. I’ve only managed to get threesomes in 2 very distinct ways. In order to be successful at both methods you need to have a high level of experience. This is not something that will happen overnight but


**Number 1 – Introducing the girls to each other:**


This is a simple process but it’s fairly difficult to pull off.


***Step 1*** – You first need to think about 2 women you’d like to do this with. It’s vital that you’ve slept with both of them, enough time to make them very comfortable around you. You don’t want your frigid ex, you want 2 girls that are open-minded, liberal and who are also bi-curios or sexually adventurous.


***Step 2*** – When you’re alone with them, try talking about it during sex (part of your dirty talk). What I’ve noticed over the years is that many women have some sort of bisexuality towards other women however; most of them aren’t up for the task. Some of the women I’ve been with are open to the idea but are not comfortable with it. If that’s the same in your case, your number one priority would be to make her comfortable with the idea.


***Step 3*** – Ok, “You know, I know this really hot girl…She’s bi (or just into it) and I’m sure she’d wanna do something like that”. They don’t mind if you slept with the other one, actually in some cases it helped (it was somewhat like an acknowledgement). If both girls seem into it, giving it a try wouldn’t take much effort.


***Step 4*** – Plan a meeting. Tell both the exact same things (that you might be meeting the other one tonight and ask if she minds to meet her as well). Don’t make plans or anything as that will only freak them out.


***Step 5*** – Set up a meeting


***Step 6*** – As soon as you get there you’ll know instantly if it’s on or not. The girls will decide this on the spot. If it’s working, YES you’ve lost weeks of planning…but it was just a shot…always remember that you were having sex with 2 women for the past months and, you just tried to DO them together. Trust me; I had things blown up in my face countless times.


***Step 7*** – Get some alcohol flowing


***Step 8*** – Ideally you want to take them to your place


***Step 9*** – At the house, then get them involved. If this is happening and everyone is at your house, you’re pretty much set.


It’s worth mentioning that some of them (well quite a few of them) do freak out at this point. If that hasn’t’ happened



**Number 2 – Using your BI girlfriend:**


Ok so a few years ago I had this bisexual girlfriend. She was hot and even better she was HOT for girls. Now even though she’s bisexual, it was my job to make her want other girls and to make her be ok about bringing other girls in bed with us.


In any case


To get things straight here, your BI girlfriend should be doing all the work. She will own it much better than you and here’s why:


***She very rarely get’s rejected


***She can identify bi-curios girls instantly.*** 


A big mistake I was always making was to work girls for 30 mins only to discover that they weren’t into other girls. Let your girl open it


The only exception here is with groups. Hardly any girl acts like we do – open up a group of girls and picks one etc. That’s when you come in


Most girlfriends love doing things together, they just get nervous and want to stay the night with you.


Anyway the reason you still want her to open is because she knows instantly if the other girl is up for it. Regardless of how good your game is, apart from my gf being upset that she’s been sitting alone for the last hour, she would also think that the other one just wanted to have sex with me and, not with US.


***Always remember


So she does the pick-up, they either leave straight up or are flattered but can’t actually do it.


If you’re lucky and she agrees, flirt with both, be sexual with both etc.


This is when they start to gang up on you. They all do it, you’re a man right?


Either you or your girlfriend can initiate the kiss. Initially I always let my gf to do it but as we did it more I tried it myself and it worked just as good.


***Now it’s time to take them home, some music and let loose. They can still freak out at this point but, most of them, if they got this far, will let it happen.


**Final note** – make sure you and your girlfriend clarify things. Make sure you let her go down on the other girl or the other way around. Also clarify that you can do your business with the other girl. I know some guys who had threesomes and only had sex with their girlfriends…what’s the point of that? Whatever you do make sure you get some action!

I was opening girls left &amp; right with an opener that I found so hilarious and effective that it would be rude of me not to share. I call it...

**The ""Don't Fucking Touch Me""**

It all started when I was walking through a bar with a friend of mine who approaches a very attractive girl. As he went to approach her in a hallway she snapped immediately and said *""Don't fucking touch me!""*

Of course we cracked up and this turned into a meme for the rest of the night.

Anyway, you silly girl."")

This is one of those non-sequitor reality destroyers that I love so much. It's hilarious and hooks 8/10 sets. 2/10 sets will get pissed off but those are the boring girls you want to stay away from anyway.

Try it out sometime, so be careful).

**Why this opener works:** Because you are doing something unexpected and unique. She is likely not used to guys hitting on her in this fashion. You are demonstrating a sense of humor and confidence that she is bound to find refeshing compared to the vast majority of pickup attempts she fends off. It also helps short circuit her normal shields and gives you a longer window to absorb her into your reality.

---

**The ""He's hung like a horse""**

Here's another hilarious routine from last night. We are waiting for a friend of ours to arrive and we're chatting up two girls at the bar. Somehow the topic of his height comes up, ""Yeah but he's hung like a horse.""

I then wait for their reaction (shock mostly). Then I keep frame and push it farther (agree &amp; amplify). *""Seriously

This leads to a string of questions and a whole conversation about how guys talk about sex versus women. Example:

&gt; HB: So you just sit around and look at each others' dicks?

&gt; Me: Nah

This sets up a very sexual frame and establishes that we are guys who like to have kinky sex.

Needless to say

---

The moral of the story is: don't be afraid to be self-entertained and have fun. Pickup should be hilarious to you. Go out seeking lulz and good things will happen.

This shit is supposed to be fun. Don't take yourself too seriously.

**The Goose and the golden egg:**

There was a very poor farmer who had a goose.  One day, and received a good amount of money from it.  The next day, he had found that the goose laid another golden egg.  Again, he went to the store and sold the egg.

After a few days, there were no eggs inside.  And now he had no way of getting any more precious golden eggs. 


**Moral of the story:**

Usually this story is told with the moral that there is no end to greed - the greedy only get greedier.  But it's not that simple.  This simple story tells an amazing principle in where to invest your energies. 

* What the farmer wanted: Golden Eggs.  
* What produced the golden eggs: The Goose. 

The farmer was blind to what actually PRODUCED the golden eggs.  Ignorantly, nurtured it, made sure it was healthy, then he would still be enjoying those eggs.


**Investing in yourself:**

In pickup

Well, speaking with.  So are you investing in yourself?

Lots of guys are focused on just the end goal of having sex with women.  While that is fine and actually helpful, his goose is getting sicker and hungrier by the day...

If you look at any truly **attractive man** , as that is also a form of investing in himself.  He will take care of his mind, body and soul.  To him, he comes first.  Not in a selfish manner, but in a manner of prioritization of his time and energy.  If he made plans to hit the gym at 6pm, and some girl texts him to grab a drink at 6pm, he will say ""Hey

**How this will affect you**:

Investing in yourself does wonders for inner game.  You actually become **higher value IN YOUR OWN eyes** .  You start to see that you ARE a man of high value.  You start adopting a sense of **entitlement** .  You have an abundance-mentality, dress, and body language.  It becomes a spiral of positivity. 


Of course, exercise, read tons of pickup literature...but never approach or actually pick up.  That would be like having a healthy, well-producing goose, but doing NOTHING with the golden eggs - they just stay there.  It's the **eternal student syndrome** .  You have to balance between goose-activities, and golden-egg-activities. 

To be truly successful at pickup

1. INVEST IN HIMSELF
2. TAKE ACTION.

1361818314.0,197f45,My life philosophies on becoming a better man,epsil119,213,39,37,"Hi Seddit...last year while trying to turn my life around

*“The habits you form here will be with you for the rest of your life.”*

**I focus on two approaches: personal growth (social skills, etc.) and intellectual growth (career, degrees, learning, etc.):**

* Carpe diem, but you have one life; make the best out of it every single day. When you are on your deathbed, the ONE question you want to answer yes to is “Did I live a fulfilling life with no regrets?” Be impulsive and spontaneous in life. Do not lead a boring life.

* Travel when you are young! – Living in one place boxes a person in. Become open-minded and roam around the world when you have time; see and absorb different cultures; learn from other people. The best learning comes from experiences.  

* DGAF – Don’t give a fuck what everyone thinks of you or want you to become. It is your life that you are living; you are not living for anyone else, not your friends. LIVE HOW YOU WANT TO LIVE AND DGAF ALL DAY EVERYDAY. 

* Do not quit learning – Learn something new everyday either from other people

* A healthy body leads to a healthy mind – Exercise often (at least 3 times a week); strive to have the body you are proud of (check out r/fitness).

* Eat healthy – 70% of obtaining the body/shape you want is diet!

* Contrary to popular belief in the seduction community, your apartment, car, etc.)

* Laziness is your worst enemy – Do not feel like going out because you are tired? Excuses, be always on time.

* Money is not everything – Money doesn’t go with you when you leave this Earth. Do not put money and monetary status on a pedestal. Having a steady income is important but do not worry too much about being rich; life is too short for that. Rather

* Lastly, then I’m sorry you are a chode. If your friends are holding you back or using you, time to ditch them . Be a value-giver and find friends who are also value-givers.

Here we go. How to daygame.

Rules (as silly as they seem
1) Keep cool - Simply means to keep your cool and not overplay it. Think about how a master womanizer would behave when talking to women. If you are not that womanizer, always step outside your self and observe yourself as third person POV. This is how you learn your mistakes

2) Have Fun - Basically means don't give a fuck. You are probably never going to see that woman again if you do get shut down, be brave, be briliant! Try out new things you never have, because when you do, that is when you realize what works and what doesn't. Don't take it all too seriously, at the end of the day, if you don't pick up a chick, that in its self is a HUGE success. Take it easy champ.


The main goal of daygame should not be just to pick up a chick
""No woman wakes up in the morning wishing not to be swept off her feet"" - Hitch
So how do you do that you ask? Well

There are 3 phases to daygame:
1) Initiation/Introduction ""Opening""
2) Rapport building
3) Closing

These 3 phases altogether can take anywhere from 2 minutes to 30 minutes to Instadate! and FFS if you get an Instadate take that oppurtunity

Let's cut right to the good stuff! ATTENTION! EVERY PIECE OF THIS IS VITAL TO SUCCESS! YOU CANNOT SKIP ANY PORTION! I know it's very thorough

Phase 1 - Initiation:
Step 1 - SMILE &amp; GREET 
This is probably the most important thing, after I walk past her and made initial eye contact. You can do it however you want, regardless if she is sitting, standing or walking, just make sure when you go up to her you are smiling and you have a warm greet! A simple ""Hi"" will do just fine.  Quick tip, don't approach girls who are running. BAD idea.

PAUSE (make sure you hold your gaze and smile after you've said hello

Step 2 - JUSTIFICATION/PRE-FRAME
At this step you are expressing your intention. It's very important how you do this, what this does from her Point of view is it sets her up slowly for what's coming, so she is prepared to be swept off her feet, she will recognize that what you are about to say is probably going to make her day! So take your time with this and make it as sweet as possible, and make sure to hold your gaze.

Another brief Pause here, the tension does not live up to the moment that you've created thus far) Slow it down, remember you want to create that movie moment for her.

Step 3 - REASON FOR APPROACH
Your reason is your intention and your initial thought about her, something you found interesting, be it her vibe, apparel, looks, smile, eyes, shoes, so I had to come meet you"". These are the moments that make it or break it

PAUSE (This is your final pause in the initiation phase and it really builds attraction like no other, and this precise technique can take you a far ways)


Phase 2 - Rapport Building:
(This phase is very modifiable to your personality and who you are, just keep your foot out of your mouth ;P)

Step 1:
""I'm [Insert name here] btw."" Stick your hand out, so you are actually holding her hand for an extra few seconds. One of my favorite moves, can be applied to any introduction anywhere and shows that you have interest in that woman.

Step 2:
From this point I get into background basics like: Where are you from, how are you liking this city, I guess her occupation, etc. Conversation should be flowing at this point, your goal at rapport building is to find common interests and talk about those things. Keep in mind, this is NOT an interview, so make sure you tease her every once in a while, comment on it

Basic pointers for rapport: connect on commonalities, talk about the night scene. WHATEVER YOUR INTERESTS ARE, CATER YOUR GAME TO IT. This way she is qualifying to you, but you are still taking interest in her. Make sure she has the oppurtunity to tell you about herself, and at that point shut the fuck up and listen. Be curious about her.

Step 3:
The 3 things you want to get out of her from rapport building is (1) Emotions (2) Motivations (3) Character traits. What this does is it makes her invest in you

Games are fun, you should definitely read some more books on Pick up and general Game.


Once you know about her interests


Phase 3 - Close:

Now that you are getting along so well with her, let's exchange numbers"" and HAND her your phone as you say it, whatever you say. BUT don't make it a question. Make it a statement. She will respond much better to a statement.

So when you hand her your phone and she puts in those digits, don't just stand there silently.
Tell her that you need a nickname for her, if you can't think of one on the spot, make it up based on her attributes eg. freckles, long legs, highheels, pink pants. etc. BUT if you're gonna do this, add a compliment at the end, Freckles girl with cute smile :)"". It's better if you have a nickname catered to her personality
So after you nickname her and you both have a good laugh about it, continue the conversation for a little bit longer before taking off.
Make sure to leave on a positive note! So the last thing that comes out of your mouth should be positive. Eg. ""It was great meeting you

THAT'S A WRAP TO SUCCESSFUL PICK UP IN THE DAYTIME

There are many contingencies I could get into, but if you keep it at, I promise you your success rates is gonna shoot through the roof. Make it your goal to pick up a 100 woman this week, so do up the 100 sets challenge and try this out, I know I'm going to!

Now text game is a whole another game to play...just get those digits

1345377936.0,ygx6u,My first attempt at Daygame - Awesome day!,sudden_epiphany,210,38,44,"Hi.

I managed to get into contact with someone with a fair deal of experience under their belt

I started my morning by waking with something like 5 hours sleep and a shitty hangover. Serves me right for drinking so much the night before  :lol: I was not in the greatest mood

It was a very interesting day, for the two I times I actually attempted. Probably my first approaches and daytime number closes ever!

I was fairly nervous inside, there is no way I would have been able to get the ball rolling without a ton of excuses and hesitation generating in my mind. I'll need to work on this over time so that I can have more independence in this.

It was great having someone that could watch me and give me some tips afterwards. At first I had to just approach indirect, I could feel how much I was. Actually the first, funnily enough - Was a 9 or 10, modelling lingerie.. this was the first opportunity that came up,  :lol:  not the easiest.

After that was a girl shopping by herself (or so I thought). Did the whole cliche *picks up female clothing item, I end up holding the conversation for 5 - 10 mins with this 4 set, get some laughter going on, and end up exiting myself.

There were many many more approaches, it worked far better than I thought it would, and I had the couple laughing. Something interesting I noted during one of these particular interactions was that I noticed my eye contact going a bit off and when I remembered to make a conscious effort, I sort of felt like I was staring, or rather like I was ""diving"" in the girl's eyes (really not sure how else to explain it  :lol: ) and suddenly she was smiling 3x as much and doing the same back to me.

I was generally nervous throughout most of this

One approach that sticks with me is a girl that I found very attractive/an 8 to me. She was laughing a lot, I was able to naturally transition my body language and lean back on a railing (yeah right so smooth  8-)  :lol: ) and she followed this movement / was in my frame. I was remembering to keep eye contact, keep my hands out of my pockets, stand up straight / dominant stance (this is a particular sticking point for me, as my posture is not good, physically rounded forward shoulders etc). I didn't know how to move this one forward, so ended up exiting myself after 5 - 10 minutes. Now I look back on the IOIs (still not doing so good at noticing these/acting on them during the interaction, but oh well.

Something I've noticed for myself personally, I'm more nervous in general, but if she is receptive, I can continue the conversation easier due to the stronger physical attraction I'm feeling? Not sure 100% sure though, I'll have to suss this out.

Now for direct approach  :shock: 

So the guy I was with decided to do a deal. He would direct approach a girl, I'd have to do 10. I dived right in and shook hands on the deal, albeit with some underlying hesitation  :? 

I watched his direct approach. Body language was absolutely flawless, and it was great to see how ridiculously happy and giddy the girl was, and how she kept looking around for him afterwards.

I observed a lot of behavior, so it would make me feel good to be able to do the same thing for someone else/be the initiator.

So I practiced a few direct approaches on the guy I was with

Putting my hands into my pockets, going for a kino touch on the outside of the arm, and looking at where I'm touching  :lol: Standing up straight/shoulders back, chest out. Also speaking LOUDER.

Direct approach was much much much harder. My approach anxiety was much higher now. I ended up approaching a 9 that was buying food. Super nervous

Guy I was with pointed out that she kept looking around for me afterwards

Anyway, it was so hard. I requested to go out to the street (I feel more comfortable doing this sorta stuff outside rather that indoors, perhaps something to do with more going on in the environment around me.)

Did another indirect, did a typical sorta ""You know what... after all this, you're actually kinda cool"" number close, got the number.

I finally built myself up to do the direct a couple of times. Had some flakes where the girl just gave me a ""deer in the headlights"" sorta look, another not so condescending, but more in a confused sort of way... Eventually I succeeded at doing a direct approach to a girl that was texting someone when I approached. It was certainly a weird experience. Number closed.

I honestly exceeded my expectations and left very happy. I don't necessarily expect the number closes to lead to anything

Approach
Keep conversations going 
Get sets laughing / getting into the interaction
Number close
Finally do a direct opener with a minimal amount of errors

So it was a day full of both blowouts, she's better than me, maybe she doesn't like my clothes etc etc"", but for me it's more me having thoughts about what I am doing wrong in my interactions, specifically - telegraphing nervousness. No matter how much I try to calm myself, it is VERY difficult to not telegraph nervousness, especially if the girl is not receptive.

1320639890.0,m35j2,Thanks Seddit! A few tips to help you along the way!,ylloj,201,30,30,"
Reddit has sucked countless hours of my precious free time but the things I have learned here have drastically changed my life. I have gone from depressed/no friends/never been kissed @ 22/forever alone/no confidence type to almost the exact opposite. Seddit has done wonders for my life

I have lost 40 lbs thanks to /fitness and /loseit.

I went from not understanding how to start any kind of relationship more than a friendship to having women chase me. 

I lost my virginity thanks to seddit! (atleast help me achieve it quicker).

In about 10 months, repetition never hurt.

1. Achieving goals - take baby steps and you won't believe how easy it can be. (Set daily/weekly/monthly goals)
2. Friends - always be around better people than yourself. It will help push you to become a better person. Always be making new friends
3. Improving yourself - Never stop improving yourself (mentally and physically). Keep learning new things and always try new experiences.
4. Comfort - if something makes you feel uncomfortable you SHOULD probably do it. Applies to all aspects of life.
5. Live for yourself - pretty much being outcome independent. Don't do things for other people
6. Smile - And say hello. You just started a conversation. (do it with EVERYONE.)
7. Outcomes - If you are thinking about doing or saying something
8. Hobbies - Find things to keep you busy and allow you to meet new people. Anything will work! Gives you conversation topics and a way to make friends.
9. Stress - It has never done you any good. Learn to live day by day and roll with the punches.
10. Gossip - Avoid it

Nothing ground breaking but a few tips I'd give to those just starting the journey. 

11. Get off the couch and start living!!

EDIT: Apprecaite all the comments and upvotes. 

Travel: For all of those lucky enough to do so

For all the University Sedditors: Join groups/clubs. Play intermurals. Don't always go after the girls. Finding another high value friend can be very beneficial. People always know other people.

1307110951.0,hqsmb,Tips on Dancing for the TRUE beginners,RogueDawg,206,34,56,"*EDIT* I'm getting lots of questions wanting more details about my explanation, and how to sponge bob :D

Hey guys. I've been seeing some comments about people not having that confidence to dance, and I would like to help out those that want to start dancing with these beginner tips. Note, I said true beginners on the title. If you already have some basic fundamentals of dancing, this post really won't help you in improving, but please do share your thoughts also.

Little about me first: I discovered that I could dance when I was 16. I entered a talent show and performed the choreography dance from Michael Jackson - Smooth Criminal with few of my friends. The responses were amazing, etc. When I found out this maybe a talent I have discovered, I continued to build on it, and I still do today. I am not a professional dancer, but an avid dancer. I've tried out for So You Think You Can Dance Season 2, and I have friends in dancing crews of Swagger Crew and Jungle Boogie from Season 5 America's Best Dance Crew.

So, and I think this will definitely help you understand the fundamentals of dancing.

Step 1: Listen to the songs carefully. Identify the tempo, analyze it. The simplest is the tempo, so practice with this first. It's almost always consistent throughout songs. Feel the tempo; count to it if you have to (1, 2, 3, 4. 1, 2, 4.). Once you got the tempo

Step 2: Now you have the tempo in your head, snapping fingers, fist pump, moving side to side, anything. Just practice moving with the tempo. While you're counting 1, 2, 3, during the COUNT you should be doing a repetitive movement. Once you got this down

Step 3: Bigger movements, synced with the counts. If you're head bobbing, try bending your knees too with the head bob, or maybe if you're fist pumping add a side-to-side movement. Stay with the count. After this, you can move to step 4.

Step 4: Mix your movements. You don't want to be head bobbing throughout the whole song, then side to side, then maybe knee bending, whatever you want to do. Mix it up ever so often. Always remember to stay with the count. If you want to kick it up a bit, try movements that takes 1 more than 1 count to complete, like 2 counts to complete 1 movement.

Practice these 4 steps repeatedly

After you understand how to move with whatever song's playing, or stiff movements, or combination.

Muscle control is involved in any type of ""animated movements."" It's not hard, and especially visible in transition from 1 type of movement to another. Body waves are the most common in creating this. There are many youtube videos on how to do body waves, so I'd suggest hitting up on some of these.

To create much more animated look, or a complete freeze. Lets say you're doing a simple side-to-side step, and you're adding like a sway. At the end of each sway, you can pause for a count. This creates an enhancement to your movements as you went from fluid to freeze. 

All in all
This is me freestyling to T-Pain - Take Your Shirt Off. As you can see, sometimes adding a ""lock"" to really enhance the visual animation. Sometimes I'll go really rough with my movements (testosterone overload!!!), but it still looks great because I'm synced with the rhythm/tempo/beat of the song playing. No matter what you do, always remember, STAY IN-SYNC WITH THE SONG. That's my #1 never-forget rule. Doesn't matter what you do, you will still look like you are dancing.

If my explanation has holes, I'm all ears. Criticisms can also help me understand some of my flaws. We are always learning, and you can always learn something from ANYONE :D But in the end, I hope I'm helping out some of you people out there!",,False,,True,t3_hqsmb

I wouldn't call what followed an argument or a fight, she just seemed a bit sensitive to the idea that she ""wasn't enough"" and that I must not care very much about her. She even said I should've just lied and that by telling her the truth I was trying to ""show off"" that I was going out with other women and that I am a ""player"". She expressed concern that she wouldn't be able to trust that I would ever be exclusive with her, but I was able to easily shoot that down. ""I'm being painfully honest now. I'm telling you shit you don't want to hear. Why would I lie to you later?""

I calmly explained that the only reason I see multiple people is because I *am* looking to be in an exclusive relationship

Around 3:30 AM, she's knocking on the door.

Her: You didn't come after me

Me: I told you I wouldn't.

At this point

Look, but already it doesn't really seem to be working. There are things you don't like about me and things I don't like about you. Maybe we just shouldn't see each other anymore.

Queue crazy make out. We move to the bed and you can see where it headed. While we were having sex

While she had gotten upset, but it's always nice to hear a girl actually admit that she came out with sex on her mind. She even said that she is going to try and date other dudes, but that we can keep seeing each other for casual sex.

The important lesson here is that you need to be honest. Don't be afraid to fuck something up with a girl. If you tell her something she doesn't want to hear and she doesn't want to talk to you again,,False,,t5_2qhrv,False,,True

It's great that there are so many users here

It seems that users who see advice that doesn't suit their needs (whether its above their level or for other reasons) downvote these posts. Also

It'd be really nice to see material that is above the usual ""be outcome independent and assume attraction"" posts that are always on this sub. But advanced material always seems to get downvoted. 

So if your reading this

1. Don't downvote a post because its above your level and you may have not found value in it (yet).

2. Don't downvote a post because it doesn't suit your needs or what your looking for. There may be many other people who will benefit from the post.

3. Don't downvote a post because it doesn't line up with your style of game. If someone is leaning towards the asshole side of game (dark triad or whatever) and doesn't have the same values or opinions as you, don't downvote someone else because their views don't support yours.

Other things I would recommend:

1. Don't give advice if you have had no actual infield experience or lack enough experience in game.

2. Don't post comments that involve you shoving down your moral opinions and views down other people's throats. Ex: ""This isn't right! You shouldn't have AMOGed that guy and pump and dumped that girl!"" Get off your high horse.

1314718926.0,jz50l,Don’t Read This…....... Unless You are Serious. ,MaysonNSS,277,104,107,"So you are serious about getting good with women? 


Here is the no bullshit way to do this. Mind you, if you do the things I am about to say your life is going to change radically. You WILL get girls, you WILL feel more confidence and people WILL say you changed, so if you want to just write posts for the next 3 years about women and not actually go out and change your life, stop reading. 



**Step 1: The Look…**

Women respond to men who dress good. FACT. If you don’t know how clothes are supposed to fit


http://www.nsscoaching.com/blog/men-build-confidence-with-fashion-and-style/


http://www.kinowear.com/blog/


Fashion IS important for several reasons and if you neglect it than you are doing yourself a disservice.  Fashion will also give you a huge boost of confidence. I tell students all the time that fashion is the quickest way to get a boost of confidence that will really help you out. Start with this step first. The reason I suggest that is because it doesn’t take long to fix it. Go spend 3 hours in a mall after reading these posts and buy 1 outfit. Have 1 thing that fits right and looks GOOD on you and then over time you will build your style as you buy new pieces. 


**Fashion makes a HUGE difference.**



**Step 2: Get off your ass…**

Stop talking ABOUT women and go talk TO women. All the mental masturbation that transpires on forums is of limited value to your success with women. One hour talking to women is worth at least 10 hours of reading material. Far too often people will post reports about how they said certain lines and ended up with the girl. A guy will read this hoping for success and try to imitate the same lines and end up nowhere. What works for one guy doesn’t always work for another because people have different personalities! 


You have to be social. You are learning social dynamics, “I am tired, I have no money.” There are free spots you can go to.  To be good at something requires passion for it. Not just for the pursuit of pussy but for the overall life altering change that comes with getting your dating life under control. 


*People have been getting laid a hell of a lot longer than this community has existed. The community should be a source of inspiration and reference


**Step 3: Get help…**

Find some friends to go out with. Are your friends useless? Make new friends via forums and people in your area that want to improve their social lives. Still getting nowhere? Hire a coach. Coaching speeds up the process of learning significantly! You can progress MUCH faster than you can imagine if you have a coach who is actually GOOD at teaching. Don’t be afraid to ask questions and email people. Hell



**Additional Notes…**

You might be thinking that this information is basic right? I challenge you to actually do these 3 things I listed. Change you look dramatically


Far too often people make excuses of why they cannot make changes. Phrases like “I cannot afford to go out


The way to really win “the game” is to eventually not have to “game” anymore. When social skills become a second nature to you then and only then will you have won.

I just watched the [Adam Lyons video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlJLLjE9_To) that was linked and I realized we didn't have a great post regarding calibration. He went into great detail regarding the different personality types of women and what they find attractive and unattractive

---

**Here are the four archetypes that women are most attracted to:**

* *Nice guy* (stereotypical strength: being nice
* *Leader* (stereotypical strength: taking charge &amp; being social
* *Bad boy* (stereotypical strength: being spontaneous
* *Provider* (stereotypical strength: buying gifts

---

**Female personality types (based on [PEN model](http://www.personalityresearch.org/pen.html)):**

* *Psychotic* (crazy, promiscuous)
* *Extrovert* (outgoing
* *Neurotic* (shy

---

* *Psychotics* respond mostly to *Bad Boys* (they enjoy risky behavior - stereotypical slutty
* *Extroverts* respond mostly to *Leaders* (they enjoy someone who can require them to be social)
* *Neurotics* respond mostly to *Nice Guys* (it makes them feel good to have a nice guy in their lives) and to a lesser extent

---

The idea is to understand that you can develop and possess characteristics of all four attractive male archetypes. This will allow you to adapt your personality on the fly (read: calibrate) to be the type that will be most attractive to the woman you are talking to.

It's also entirely possible to display the positive traits of *ALL* the personality archetypes while *DROPPING* the negative traits (e.g. doing nice gestures but not being needy. Or taking charge and deciding where to go on dates but not doing things she won't find enjoyable.) This is fully in line with the [Characteristics of a Modern Alpha Male](http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/fobhj/lesson_1_primer_on_being_a_modern_alpha_male/) that I wrote for our Inner Game series.

Understanding how to calibrate for the three different personality types will help take your game to the next level. Like anything else

It's also important to calibrate for a girl's energy level.

Related to the studies, and smile! ;)

Lastly, introspective ones, you want to play up your nice guy side (but drop the neediness). I bet this is good news for a lot of you out there.

There you go

A little bit of background about me, I'm nobody extraordinary. I am just a normal guy like all of you who worked my ass off and made dating and meeting women my passion.


Originally from the Midwest


Before I came out to LA I picked up the book, I was just too scared to go out and break out of my comfort zone. After a few months and ending a terrible long distance relationship, I had a change of mind. I made dating, going out to bars/clubs, and socializing my passion. I went out 3-5x a week for about 3 years straight. Sometimes I would go out for 2-3 weeks in a row without stopping. There was never any drinking involved. In fact I stopped all bad habits: smoking, drinking, and eating shitty. I wanted to reform myself entirely.


Along my journey I created a popular podcast on iTunes, *The Social Rules*, both about dating advice. Around 2 years ago I created my own company, TrippAdvice. I became so passionate during my journey that I wanted to make this a career and help other guys succeed, just like I did. It's not a fad. I'm in this for the long haul. In fact, I just finished my first e-book with some solid advice I gained over the years which you can get for free on my website. Most of my advice comes from the successes and failures I had in the field while some comes from forums on the internet I was active on while I went through my journey. I've worked with men ages 18-61 and it's been incredible.


With that said

Then I'm gonna call you, crying. And you're gonna come back to me, and you gotta tell me, 'I love you babe.'"" GOLD. So I lean into her and say, ""I love you babe."" And grab her ass. ""OMG, you just groped my ass."" I lean into her ear. ""Yea and you totally wanted it."" She giggles.

""Oh I heard girls like getting their hair pulled too."" ""Yeah?"" I go in, he's pulling my hair."" Her friend goes, ""Oh she loves getting her hair braided.""

After awhile, the friend goes, ""Give her a neck massage!"" I proceed. My target: ""You're so gentle with me. Harder!"" I lean into her ear, ""Harder, babe?!"" My target squirms with giggles, as I lean into her, she puts her head down exposing her neck completely and I'm really digging into her neck (never done this before, guys looking at me like: WTF

Their HB6 friend is literally now pawing my left arm for attention. Scratching my arm with her fingernails. I do the neck massage to her, but she pretends like she doesn't like it. So I keep doing it to both my target and HB6. Whispering, ""I'm trying to make you jealous. I heard this jealousy thing works really well.""

My friend comes to grab me. ""Dude we're leaving."" ""I'm having so much fun with these girls!"" Girls laugh. He grabs me and starts DRAGGING me out, while my friend is dragging me away.

She dials her number, re-dials her correct number into my phone, calls, and waits until it goes into her voicemail, she starts talking into the phone. I come into the set, grab the phone, and start talking into the phone, actually

*When I did go in for the kiss, ""I'm sorry to interrupt, sorry, this will just take a second. I'm going to kiss you."" I went for the kiss, was the first to retract, and told her, ""Okay, he probably would have been bitching about how this girl just wanted a hug at the end of the date.

1344255469.0,xrg89,My oneitis dropped the bomb on me this morning. I have never felt more motivated in my life,TheOneYearProject,209,42,89,"Today is the 6th of august 2012.

2:00 AM in the morning.

I haven't had a job for like a year. I desperately try to quit smoking to get in shape. When I look at myself in the mirror, meet new people, and in the end I’m the one sitting at home all the time playing video games, imagining that I was the hero in those stories. I haven't had sex in half a year, and that doesn’t even really count since it was my ex-girlfriend and we used to hook up regularly after our breakup. The last time I had 'new sex' with a woman was last November. And on top of all that, I failed to play it cool when the girl I really like just told me that she fucked some other dude in his car while she was drunk last weekend.

Today is the 6th of august 2012. And now I am going to change everything.

It is 1 pm now and I just smoked my last cigarette. I think quitting is easy

The girl I like is studying in Brazil right now
Worse thing about that is
Of course I knew that this was a stupid idea before I even asked

When I went shopping for groceries this morning, same eyes, same body; and I thought to myself that something cosmic was making fun of me right now. Of course this is bullshit, I don’t believe in higher power or some kind of god at all, but this showed me how fucking miserable I was. I haven't felt like this since I was a teenager, always chasing the girls who saw nothing more than a friend in me and ended up telling me how much they liked this other guy. God damn, I really thought I learned how to deal with those kinda situations; turns out I am just on the beginning of my journey.

But what helps me is the fact that I put this girl on a pedestal. I have been searching for 'oneitis' in the seduction subreddit and it soon became pretty clear to me. It has been some time since a girl showed some interest in me so I totally focused on this girl

I can’t issue that enough: I am not doing this for this particular girl. I am doing this because I know that I need to change my life, and this was just this one thing that set the ball rolling.

This is My One Year Project. Now don’t get me wrong; I want to improve and change my life on almost every aspect, and seeing this particular girl again one year from now will be my personal kick in the ass to begin with. 

Living well is the best revenge they say, my sadness, my jealousy and my agony into this to benefit and learn from it.

Last night I went sarging with a buddy of mine in vegas. If any of you have been down here you know how crazy and extravagant the clubs are. They're packed with celebrities, and some of the most beautiful girls the world can offer. Now after standing in line for about an hour and losing some pregame buzz we finally make it through the doors. I say hey to this HB8 as soon as I walk in and she just tells me to fuck off and go die. This amazing start had me yearning for more so I chat up a few other people as we made our way to the bar, my friend trying to get in on these walk by sets by shaking hands and being friendly. We make it to the bar and turn on our hottie senses. Over his shoulder, about 20 feet away, I see this gorgeous girl with a group of friends. I signal to him but he tells me that he's just gonna stay with the 3 set of girls we just opened up.

I decide that I had to approach this HB9/10 so I start making my way through the crowd to her. Now idk how I came up with this opener on the walk over but it worked like a charm. I ran up to her and gave her a big hug

I tell her to introduce me to her friends and I introduce myself as her cousin Will. Her friends are cool with me and instantly accept me in the circle. I start telling embarrassing stories about the time I accidentally gave her night time meds for her cold when she was at work. Also, her friend jumps in between us and is like wtf are you kissing cousins. She explains we're not really cousins, and her friend laughs at my story and says it was really funny.

Fast forward a bit, says ok and tells her friends. We get food and as we're eating she's sitting on my lap. I pull a washington monument, fiddle with pleasure button and I get the F-close with her in my car next to a bag of In-N-Out.

I arrive before her and I'm a bit buzzed.  Earlier event was at another bar where I had a couple beers and talked to strangers about common interests.  She's late
Things I specifically intended to do and carried through on:
- Eye contact.  I've heard more than once here that AWKWARD PAUSES ARE A GIFT.  THEY ARE FOR YOU TO BUILD SEXUAL TENSION.  LOOK HER IN THE EYES.  PUSH YOUR COMFORT ZONE.  EXCITE HER AND COMMUNICATE INTEREST.  So

-kino  I didn't kino early.  I didn't have her sit next to me.  We sat across from each other at a small candlelit table.  However

-internalizing the idea that I have to see if she's cool enough for me.  This made it easier to talk to her.  I wasn't trying to ask the right questions to keep her interested.  I was trying to see if she interested me. And when she did I was willing to say when I was impressed.  

-have fun.

-don't reject myself.  Added that to my inner game.  I don't reject myself.  That means I make choices that reflect that.  It also means I speak unashamedly about my current situation as someone who is unemployed and without his own place.


So, what do you think of her?

After a long while

We catch a cab.  The driver is playing his music loudly.  We start dancing in the back.  She stops and while she's talking she turns to me and locks on.  I know now that she's waiting to be kissed.  You don't always have to wait for this, Nala gives him a look and ""Can You Feel the Love Tonight?"" starts playing.  It's that look.  So, I kiss her, but pull away first.

At her house, but no sex.  Ok.

In bed

Anyway, she's saying no sex and then wanting to ask me questions.  I got used to thinking of LMR as the woman not wanting to be seen as or think of herself as a slut, but I got something else here.  She wanted to make sure I was interested in her for more than just sex.  I guess that was something I could have communicated better earlier in the night.  I wasn't making any promises to be her bf and she knew that, but she didn't want me to sleep with her and then never talk to her again.  That was not my intention and I said so.  Eventually, she changes her mind without me trying to convince her.

The morning of the sixth day she emails me: ""I recommend &lt;instructor&gt;

Assuming attraction, we line up a date for Sunday (yesterday).  There were several back-and-forth in setting up a time, she was really seeming to make an effort to find a time that worked for both of us.  More evidence of interest.

I arrive, I accept that sounds safer and so we head to the beach.  I'm upping the kino a bit (I'm getting pretty into this girl.  She's my body type, has common interests, and I can tell she has put a lot of effort into getting her life in order).  But she is not responding positively.  An arm on the back goes noticed, but no obvious reciprocation.  An arm around her shoulder and she's not acting all that emotionally warm.  **But she is still with me.  She hasn't suggested we end the evening.  So though something is up, her actions indicate she's not out of this yet.**  We sit on a swingset on the beach and start really honestly talking.  Pretty rapidly she's telling me she likes to start off friends, that she has attachment issues when things get physical, emotional contact

What do I do? I tell her straight up that I am not in the business of hanging out with a woman weekly just to be friends.  Not a woman I'm attracted to.  I tell her that sex is important, but she stayed and kept asking questions.**

**Her words were repeatedly: We will just be friends.**

**Her actions in response to my declining the offer: Staying with me, challenging me.**

We end up back at this hotel lobby and talking for another hour.  She's opening up to me. Rotating in her seat

10:30 PM (date started 5:30) she pays the bill and drives me to my car.  En route I bring up uncertainty over her sexual repression (conversation earlier had made me concerned - so I wanted to screen her).  Result? Thirty minutes of talking about sex, likes and dislikes in male anatomy, and much more.  Pretty clearly she's changed in her posture towards me.  **She is acting a bit like she is afraid she has ruined her chances with me.**  I tell her it is getting late, wish her a safe drive home and move to get out of the car.

Her: ""Don't I get a goodnight hug?""

I grumble (I don't like end-of-date closes of any sort really

Her with a concerned face: ""Are we dating?""

Me in my head: LOL WTF knew it

Me: ""We are hanging out""

She lights up.

Her: ""Can I kiss you?""

1369328690.0,1eww11,3 [FR] in one: Graduation,chanyourmind,249,80,42,"Quick background on me. I'm 21, been a recovering AFC for the past 4 years, just starting to try out some routines and sets here and there

Just graduated from a 4 year uni, everybody just finished their work and have nothing to do but blow off steam, all of her friends are leaving, giving her a crazy emotional cocktail of nostalgia, excitement for the next stage in her life, fear of the unknown, sadness

Basically a gold mine. What I've essentially been doing is calling every single girl I've ever been attracted to and asking her to either (depending on the girl)
---
1. meet up one on one at some quiet venue to ""catch up"" or ""spend quality time together"" or ""say goodbye in person""
2. invite her to a large social gathering where the only person she'll know there was me (I could basically cram 5 or 6 girls into the same evening)
3. openly just inviting her to fuck

Not every single invitation was accepted right away, nobody wants to be thought of as a shitty friend at graduation.

I'll give a sample FR of how each one of those three scenarios played out.
---
***
1) Ex-girlfriend, gotten hotter senior year after learning how to do her hair and makeup properly, and dressing better (HB-6 then, HB-7 now). I invite her to lunch (I literally had a date to a party right afterwards and that was the only time I could fit her in).

She shows up in this super hot club-y dress to a lunch date, she tries to sit down across the table from me, but I move her so she is sitting next to me (Are you wearing sunblock? Come sit in the shade so you don't burn). We make small talk and order food, I'm touching her on the shoulder all the time to emphasize points, grabbing her arm to point things out on the street around us, touching her hands to look at her class ring. Our food comes and the gloves come off the table.

So when did you realize breaking up with me was a bad idea? She blushes immediately and I keep going. When did you realize [wet blanket, she didn't really know how great a guy I was back then, she's more mature now and she knows what she does was a mistake. I just start openly talking shit about doug, and it turns out she broke up with him after a few months (something I didn't even know had happened). She laughs and agrees and we had a good conversation talking shit about doug. 

Lunch ends and I pick up the check (I'm making a lot of money now) she insists on buying me coffee to repay me, let's call her nat], we're going to a party later together. What type of party? The two of us got invited to an all day rooftop kegger in [super expensive part of town]. She's giving me puppy dog eyes at this point, clearly she wants to me to invite her and clearly I'm not going to do it. Nat pulls up in front of the cafe, so I grab my coffee and walk out the door and thank her for coffee. She practically runs out after me and asks me for a goodbye hug. I'm in super dgaf mode so I just look her in the eye and straight up caveman makeout with her in the middle of a busy sidewalk in broad daylight while Nat waits for me right outside in a car. Several dudes catcall, Nat rolls her eyes. We finish kissing and I hop in Nat's car and I promise to stay in touch, etc
***
2) I'm at a bar with a whole bunch of people, who I've literally never met before, so I ask one of my friends (who is good friends with one of the kids she came in with) what her name is, and he tells me she's [let's call her Anika]. I'd already been doing well all night so I was in super Alpha mode. I go up to her when she's at the bar and say Anika! I can't believe how long it's been! She looks super confused and embarrassed that she doesn't know me. I'm like, remember [one of the guys she came in]'s parties sophomore year? We used to play beer pong together, I'm chanyourmind! She does one of those fake I just remembered moments and says oh yeah, chanyourmind, I'm honestly hurt

We talk about life and get into a super hillarious conversation about 50 shades of grey (trust me, some of whom she knows. I ask her if she's ever seen a particular room in the bar we're at (it's really cool, filled with celebrity pictures with the owner of the bar), and she says she hasn't, so I lead her over. This side of the bar is pretty much deserted, the room is empty.

We go in and I use a line that I got from Jon Simm's [sins of attraction video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sbB8AuTBouY). So if you could be doing anything in the world right now, because I guess I enjoy music and spending time with people. She has this look of panic on her face like she's afraid she's not interesting enough for me. So I cut her off. Do you know what I'd do? What? I'd travel everywhere, I want to kiss pretty girls from around the world. She does the whole routine where she pretends to be offended at how much of a player I am. I don't apologize and look her in the eye and say, I think white girls from America are so boring, they're brought up in uninteresting families leading uninteresting lives of no importance and act so smug and entitled to their boring little existence, they lack a perspective that other countries have, and that makes girls from those countries so much more attractive. The look on her face was absolutely pure money. Ended up k-closing her right then and there and going back to her place for a bj.
***
3) There's this girl who I've known pretty well for a long time, you need to try harder.

I was bored so I started texting her nasty, and after her class was over, I call her, and she goes, chanyourmind, we need to talk about what happened today. I invite her out to a bar nearby that I know she likes, she agrees.

We go to the bar and I buy her a drink, but I could tell that she was interested and basically was looking for an excuse to hook up with me without looking like a slut. We start talking, friendly at first, casual and non sexual, talking about stuff like friends leaving. She starts getting bored and keeps looking at her watch. She has class the next morning, she has reading to do, etc. At this point I've almost given up on hooking up with her, but before we leave, we run to her car and get soaking wet on the way there, she just runs out into the rain and I follow her. We get absolutely soaked

1344064723.0,xnvqy,[FR] After work dinner turns into 6am threesome + new F buddy. Also dealt with last minute IN BED cockblock. ,makinplays,205,36,50,"So every few weeks at my work a group of us go out for BYO dinner and drinks. Last night we went out

Anyway the second hottest girl there is an HB8.5 and she's one that I've kinda thought might be keen for a while, and HB8.5 comes and sits next to me. as she was further down the table before and we start small talking e.g. how have you been, what have you been upto etc.. And then she asks me if I'm seeing anyone. I tell her that I'm not seeing anyone exclusively, and then turn the question on her. She tells me that she's been texting this guy for about a month, and that they've met up a few times but he doesn't seem interested in sleeping with her and that she's getting really frustrated.

Someone else interrupts at this point so we don't get to continue the conversation, arms, hands, ears(earrings) and thigh), which she responds really well to by touching me back. and we talk about her travel plans and I give her some travel tips (DHV). 

Now there's another girl at work who I have a running joke that I'm married to as I was the one who trained her, HB9 tells me I'm an awful husband as I didn't pay for her. I tell her that I've had enough of her whining and that I'm leaving her for HB8.5 and go and put my arm around her. She responds and puts both her arms around me and we tease HB9 for a while. 

Anyway then we all head to the pub, she then asks me what I think. I tell her I think that she seriously needs to get laid, and tease her a bit about being hung up on one guy. She then says that she has no options, and I say that I'd definitely sleep with her but she seems like a bit of a clinger so she's out of contention. She tells me that I have a sexy accent, but it would be awkward at work. And I tell her that it doesn't matter anyway, because I don't sleep with clingers. (bear in mind this was all said in an incredibly light and teasing tone).

Anyway after that my friend who was talking to her says he wants to go check out this other bar he's a regular at, let's go!"" and then turn and start to walk away. She says bye to her friends and RUNS after me. 

When we get to the bar my friend pulls her aside for a cigarette,  we dance a bit, but I'm struggling with KINO and she's not really that into it which confuses me as she responded really well to my KINO at dinner. 

After maybe 20 minutes the rest of the group turn up looking for us

They're all dancing with me and each other, and HB7 keeps coming over to me and grinding and dirty dancing with me, and I'm starting to escalate dance kino with HB8.5 but she still seems a bit off. Eventually she says to me ""what's going on with you and HB6? are you together?"" I laugh and tell her that we slept together once, and that it's nothing at all and after that she loosens up a lot. 


The thing that I enjoyed most about this club though was that guys were hitting on these girls left right and centre, and they'd come and be all over me. I stole HB6, HB8.5 and HB7 from dancing with one guy at seperate times with simply a look and a beckon for them to come to me and he was fucking pissed off. I don't know why, but having been the AFC who has lost the girl to guys with game so many times in the past being on the other end of it just felt amazing. 

Anyway we change clubs for the final time and go to this last place where everything really starts to escalate. Me and HB8.5 are really grinding hard and my hands are all over her body and I'm kissing her neck and nibbling her ear, and is literally grabbing my hands and placing them under her top and on her inner thighs. 

Then I go to the bathroom

Anyway it gets to about 5am and we go out for a cigarette, and say ""Yeah. Hah, a couch. Totally"" She laughs and says that we can all try and squeeze into my bed. And HB7 says she'll sleep on the couch (I find out at this point she has a boyfriend). 

So we basically go and get some food and head home, and HB8.5 all squeezed together. I really want HB7 out of this situation as I don't do cheating, and tell her she should go into the lounge and find a movie to watch or something cos she's in my spot. She does, and then comes back (something I didn't plan on). And It's me between HB6 and HB8.5 and I have my arms around both of them and I'm making out a little bit with HB6 and feeling up HB8.5 at the same time. HB7 though just won't get the fucking hint. I say ""hmm, there seems to be not much space in the bed, I think it's only really designed for 3 people""..... Nothing.... Then I say ""Hmm, if you'd be more comfortable you can sleep on the couch HB7?"" and she goes ""Or I could just sleep here....""... Me and the other girls are trying so hard not to laugh at the awkwardness of the situation.. but eventually I just say ""OK HB7

HB6 texted me in the morning saying that she loved the threesome and that it was her first one, and that we should hang out some time. 

One more thing which was weird as hell but not really relevant to the FR, and HB6 says to HB7 ""HB7, we're going to fuck now. So...."" Then HB7 goes ""So I guess I have to leave then?"" HB6 goes ""Well you don't have to leave... but.... uhh....."" and HB7 says ""Oh ok, I don't mind staying. I know what sex is"" and then me and HB6 fuck with HB7 sitting in the room watching south park. 

I think HB7 really wanted sex too

These rules have to be ingrained in your brain for them to work. They are about having a confident, try thinking with these.

**1) NEVER give a fuck**: Nothing anyone says affects you. You are in your state and it is not changing. Be who you are and don't be afraid to do or say whatever you see fit. (*Wingman tactics used here: A girl says some snippy, and your wingman would laugh to lighten the mood and help you establish a playful frame that you and your wingman control.*) A girl rejects you? Don't care, it's unimportant in the end. 
  *i.e. Outcome Independent*

**2) You own the place**: No matter if it's a bar, you need to ALWAYS act as if you are at home, in any environment. Many people clam up in new/different places. You will not. Forcing yourself to feel at home will (in time) give you the comfort to do whatever you want, vastly improving your game. You wouldn't be afraid to talk to someone if they were sitting on your couch, you should treat everywhere you go like that. 
  *i.e. Confidence to approach

**3)Every girl wants you**: You ARE attractive and fun. That girl that just eyed you? Yea, have gotten freaked out by exceptionally hot woman. Don't treat her any differently than a girl that's so ugly, you wouldn't even take a BJ from her. This makes you the **prize**. She has to work for you, because you have a sea of other options. 
  *i.e. Prizing*

So fast forward a little bit

**This is where the don’t be this guy comes in.**  Some guy who is friends with my girl comes over, and talk to him a little bit.  I can immediately tell that this dude is a hardcore AFC.  

So fast forward some more and my two friends, and myself have bounced to another bar.  So AFC goes to the bathroom and I say to my girl, “He really likes you.”  She responded with, “Yeah, I know.  He asked me out while we were on a ski lift together one time, but I really just see him as only a friend. “  A little bit later the bar is closing and I ask her how she is getting home.  She tells me that AFC is going to give her a ride, to which I reply, he doesn’t have to.  I’ll drive you.”  She then turns around to AFC and tells him that I’m going to give her a ride

i carried this mentality over to monday when we came back for school.  ignored her.  didn't talk to her.  not so much as look at her either.  when she tried talkin to me

we were still friends, ""no i'm not"" and just walked away.  steadily, she'd been trying to get my attention more and more everyday.

it all culminated to this past weekend when we all went out as a group for the first time since the party to an all day outdoor concert.  i went about doing my own thing like usual:  ignoring her and just having fun.  but as the day went on, etc)

not much but its def a great start.  i got more done in one month with an alpha mentality than in 2 years as a beta.

&gt; Show me the ways of the Jedi. It is great to imagine myself doing this, or just way too dressed up.

Well

This one's actually fuckin' easy. I'll admit, but I nailed the confidence thing a long time ago -- perhaps in the nerdiest way.

I was hanging with my buddy and his girlfriend playing video games, the worst she can say is 'no'"", and as I begin to retort with: ""but what if she doe..."" she stops me with: ""Listen, you sit here and die in this game like 38 times in a row trying to achieve the most menial goal, and no one judges you for failing until you get it right.""

And then it all clicked -- Confidence was an achievement that needed unlocking and I had to grind it 'til it was owned.

So

* When walking down the street, so when you see someone interesting you just smile and say ""Hello. How is your day treating you?"". After less than 5 sentences of chit-chat (or none at all), dismiss yourself.
* Phase 2: compliments -- See a hot girl (or some dude you feel out-alpha'd by)? Stroll right on up and give them a ""Hey, you look slick, did you find those shoes from reading /r/malefashionadvice?"". Now you've actually engaged in conversation with a hot girl but to make it a no-fret no strings attached confidence builder, there's an important step: dismiss yourself and walk away!
* Phase 3: Go to a bar/party/sports event alone, reruns of Dick van Dyke, sci-fi novels, doesn't fucking matter. If she isn't interested it doesn't matter, because you're going to be polite and dismiss yourself and walk away after a maximum of 10 minutes conversing.

Life is work first, you have to work to complete all the things you expect of yourself.  Each little thing you complete gives you a tiny bit of self-respect.  Each thing you neglect without good reason takes away a tiny bit of self respect.  And I’ve found self-respect is highly related to self-love.  Once you’ve worked, take time to play, have fun, etc- at this point you’ve earned it.   

Work isn’t solely your job, keeping up with personal hygiene.  Then there are larger things after that, going to school, forwarding your career, etc.  

I've gained a lot of my confidence from reading ""The Seven Habits of Highly Effective People"" and putting them into action.  One of the main points is private victories precede public victories.  I think these directly parallel inner game and outer game.  When you have the discipline and willpower to attain self-control

For example, successful person.  In the past, fun gave me happiness.  I knew I needed to focus on my future, but I wanted instant gratification, and would trade time I could spend to better myself to play videogames or watch TV.  I had fun for a while doing this, but in the last few years, it's left me feeling more and more empty.

Now I know this- I like fun and entertainment, not really.  But when these things are done, I feel fulfilled, and ready for anything that comes my way- friends coming in to town, a girl coming over, even unrelated things like my productivity at work.  Once I've had these small, private victories

A lot of the stuff on the inner game sidebar is very useful information, you won't be able to be what you want socially either.  It’s like a hidden prerequisite to the prerequisite.  To gain REAL, inner confidence, you have to be ALL the things you want to be.  You have to move toward being a complete person whose qualities support each other, and then you'll be able to do anything.  But even before that, you have to be READY.

I've heard it described as ""your home is your kingdom"".  To me, NOW.  If I wait until later, the work will only compile and intimidate me into submission.

I think a lot of us are in, to have a day where we can slack off and do nothing.  Then we never get back on our game.  We wonder why we feel bad, and in this negative state, we look toward extrinsic things to make us happy.  Mine were weed and videogames, what the fuck do you know?  And I wondered why I wasn't happy, assuring myself that getting the little things in order *couldn’t* really bring me back to the level I once was at.  The problem was that I was looking at each thing individually, not recognizing that they are meant to work together.  I now know, a synergy develops that keeps you going.  You begin to believe that you CAN be everything you want to be.  And belief is the most important step.  “Fake it till you make it” might work on singular aspects of life, and trade up.  Use a small amount of confidence to step out of my comfort zone, and LIVING.

I know I'm reiterating, it can start a chain reaction.  When you say fuck it to one thing, at that moment, you're basically saying fuck it to your entire life; you're saying you can’t handle it.  A quote that sticks with me: ""If you can't handle the dishes, how do you expect to handle running a fortune 500 company?""

Self-control is so god damn important.  It saves you from those moments of want

Forgive me if this isn't that cohesive.  I hope I got my point across.  

**TL;DR** Win over yourself before trying to win over others.  Work hard each day, down to the seemingly insignificant actions, and feel fulfilled.

I was always that shy, never even had sex without paying for it. The sad thing is that I'm a really good-looking guy and I'm in great shape... but I was always too scared to approach or I just had the worst luck in general. Girls would approach me or show interest and I could never score a touchdown.

A few years ago I found The Game by Strauss and eventually Seddit. After college and so many near-girlfriends and blown opportunities to hookup

So after a year of a lot of trial and error and slowly improving my lifestyle, my wardrobe, my car, and my game I finally had a girl who I could call my girlfriend. I finally had sex. I finally had someone crazy about me. She was pretty, tall, great T&amp;A, great in bed, right before New Years

This past week was leading up to it. As soon as I got a girlfriend, clingy, creepy self. Maybe the real me?

She said I did too much PDA, and too needy. She said she wasn't the right girl for me. It crushed me a lot, especially for it to happen now around the holidays.

It sucks we only lasted a few months but I regret nothing. Thanks to this subreddit I learned so much. I honestly thought I'd never need you guys again so I deleted my account

There's a lot of stuff here on how to get a girlfriend but maybe not enough on how to keep one. There's a bit of pessimism in this subreddit too from me just looking around today

I don't even know why I'm posting this or what else to say. I just needed to vent too... sorry if this is the wrong place but I feel like Seddit deserves some thanks.

So you managed to step up to your AA and got that girl's number? Great. Got a date? Even better. Made her your girlfriend? Wow, but here it comes. **Do not settle down, think you've done your part and everything is butterflies from now on.**

Over a year ago, and it all snapped in my head. I wanted her. I wasn't going to let her go away like I did with all the past ones. I decided to step up to my AA and went on reddit to get some advice, and found out about seddit. I posted [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/kzr62/i_know_i_should_go_for_her_but_how_ive_got_3_days/). It's kind of funny to look back on it now.

One approach, late into the night, and practised my game on her. Turns out she had a boyfriend, shit I told myself at first. Fuck it I told myself at second. I didn't give two fucks, didn't develop oneitis and went on with my awesome life. Thing is, when I talked to her about other girls, she would get kind of jealous. I noticed her flirting with me every now and then aswell. I was at loss here, she had a boyfriend! Turns out he was an ass. Two months later, and all the romantic things that you can think of. It was awesome

Here's why: as soon as I got in this relationship, my techniques worked and I had that girl with long-term potential. I wasn't looking for anything else so why keep on with the game? And that's when all my AFC shit crawled back up at me. I got jealous, I got insecure, I was a wreck. I was, as I like to call it, a little beta bitch. I often would break up in tears over insignificant shit, because I was making such a big deal out of everything. I wasn't secure about my actions and my decisions. I almost lost her because of this. We've talked things through

But I'm not here to rant about my relationship.

Guys. Even if you're just looking to get one girl and are not into gaming every Friday night, then she's not for you. Approach just for the sake of meeting people and being friends! Be cool, be awesome, be confident and never take her for granted. Make sure you don't do the same mistake as me and think that you're good now and don't have to game anymore, because you will lose here if you get back to being an AFC. Here's a [good guide](http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/tlorg/my_relationship_manifesto_what_to_do_after_you/) about it by the way.

So this is an FR that takes place over the span of a little more than a month. If any of you had read my latest FR, to really hot. I'm going to pick this up where my last FR left off, let's dig in!

So, after having chilled 1 or 2 more times among friends, I sent her a message on FB asking her if she'd like to grab some drinks. Result? She never answered me. **Fuck**. So what did I do? I simply organized a night out with my friends on the day I wanted to go with her, and on that very day she sent me a message and tagged along with us.

Now this is where it gets messy. Fast forward a few days or so and we're all at a bar having some drinks. She mentions going up to Montreal the next day cause she has to check out some appartments

So I made her visit a couple of things, I turn to her and touch her arm and say ""come closer"" as I myself inch a little closer.

**She looks at me

FUCK. Complete and total door slam right in my face. I got out of the car and (thanks to seddit) *did not* apologize and instead said I didn't want to make her uncomfortable and that I simply felt like doing that in the moment. She says ""well

After this event, like my usual self. It actually felt like nothing had happened after a while and we were back on square one, fresh start.

We went to go see a concert together (the xx and grizzly bear down by canal lachine)

**IMPORTANT NOTICE**

At this point I was terribly afraid of falling in the friendzone, a lot of kino, etc. I was sitting on a fucking fence. I was thinking ""why does she spend so much time with me but shut me down? She must only see me as a friend.."" Nonetheless I kept it up and made my intentions as clear as possible, I felt like we were getting closer to one another.

She eventually starts being much more open and fun via texting (she was always ridiculously distant) and I took that as a good sign. 

**DISCLAIMER**

Keep texting minimal!!! I never never never texted her for no reason or ""just to chat."" I was always planning something and from THERE we'd have a brief conversation. DON'T BE A NEEDY CHUMP.

On the 23rd, but couldn't sleep over because she had work at 7 the next morning.

Guys, she threw on *heavy* kino, especially when I was wearing only my bathing suit.

Eventually she had to leave and we said bye

She texted me a few minutes after leaving

she responded with ""hey it's your fault if something happens

And then I said something like ""yeah.. I should've accompanied you to the bus stop huh..? This place is pretty dangerous.""

**GOLDEN RESPONSE**

She says: ""Yeah

NOW we have something! I was pretty fucking excited, lol! I went to her place with my friend and his girlfriend on thursday to have supper, which was cool, and on friday (yesterday) we met up at the jazzfest in montreal. This is where the fun is!

**CLOSING**

So I drove up with my buddy to the jazzfest to meet her and 2 of her friends. Early on in the day she mentioned we could sleep over at her appartment if we'd drink too much. We leave jazzfest around midnight and head over to a bar nearby. This whole time she was being VERY touchy, I nonchalanty place my hand on her knee under the table while talking with the others and leave it there. Eventually I take it off and she comes and grabs my hand in hers (YES!!!). The whole night, we kept touching under the table, scratching our legs, touching hands, etc. Until my friend and her friend got up to go to the bathroom.

I am a textbook ""friend zone"" guy that clings onto girls that like hanging out with me whom have zero intention of intimacy. This time, I didn't let that happen.

I met a girl at my part-time job, I asked her out to a traditional dinner date, just like I promised myself that I would. She turned me down, however, with the hackneyed responses including ""I just got out of a bad relationship"" (though I won't discredit its possibility) and the usual, well-intentioned ""you're a really cool guy, though."" I accepted the response politely and maturely

Though I can't say that it didn't suck, and never was meant to be.

The reason I'm posting this is mostly because I'm too embarrassed to talk about it with my friends as they all have had girlfriends long before me and would probably just pity me (when that's the worst thing for your self-confidence). But I share with you with the reddit anonymity a story that I am more proud of than ashamed, you need to do it.

TL;DR I asked a girl out

A good example to isolate would be saying something like, I really love that about you."" Normally she'll thank you or be flattered, whatever, so you follow up with, ""Hey, you know what would be really fun, we should go for a walk down the boulevard/to the park across the street/etc.""

If you wanted to close rather than isolate, how about we exchange numbers so we can keep in touch?"" Lyons also stated in another of his videos that grounding your suggestions with reality is important, otherwise she's not going to have anything to grab onto (""Why's he wanting me to give him my number?"").

You’ve “been yourself” for your entire life. How far has that gotten you with women? Go ahead and answer that question quietly to yourself. My guess is the answer is, not too far. The real advice here is:

Be your best self.

If you want to improve with women and your social life you must think about the overall picture. Make a list at all the areas that you believe need improvement. You know better than anyone else what you’re good at and what you’re not. Here’s a great place to start:

**Humor**
Women love men that are funny. Do you make people laugh? Can you take a joke?

**Health**
Are you obese or underweight? Do you have good breathe?

**Fashion**
Do you dress well? Do you look good at work and when you go out on the town?

**Travel/Culture**
Are you cultured? Have you been out of your hometown? Are you open minded?

**Fears**
Do you face them? Are you always paranoid? Do you take chances?

**Hobbies/Skills**
Do you have them? Are you working on getting them?

**Solid body language**
Do you slouch? Do you look people in the eye when you talk to them?

**Conversation skills**
Can you hold a conversation? How are you at talking with strangers on a daily basis?

**Passions**
Do you have them? Do you work at them?

Constantly work at these goals. Those are the ways you can better yourself and begin to become attractive. This isn’t being fake. This isn’t changing who you are as a person. You are bettering yourself one step at a time.

""Buy my friend a drink. She is getting married""! 

My two friends fell silent. As I casually responded. 

""That's the exact reason why I shouldn't buy her one. But are you single?""

HB8 ""no

I wrap my arm around her and say ""I really want you to give me a blowjob but neither of those things are going to happen tonight!""

My two friends burst out laughing. She blushed and said that she was getting one of her single friends for me. At that point

It made me realize that girls are no different than panhandlers. They look at you and expect you to give them something. Have you ever watched a panhandler ask you for money? As soon as you say that you don't have cash

This has been my philosophy for over a year. I don't buy girls drinks because girls don't buy drinks for me. The end results is that it splits girls in to two categories: Golddiggers and StatusQuoHoes. 

Golddiggers are like panhandlers. Once they realize that you will not give them what they want

StatusQuoHoes, the sooner she realizes that you are not a typical guy. Interest builds as she wonders what would make you buy her a drink. 

I normally spin this into having the girl buy me drinks. Typically a shot and a beer. Why? because I'm worth it. At that point she has invested in YOU and now with the ball in your court. Take control of the night.

Instead of putting my headphones in and blasting my music like usual, I decided that I was going to be social for a change (worked out nicely since they didn't play shit music like usual).

Then I hit the brick wall that is my AA. 

I did 3 sets of squats and 2 sets of hack squats (this is relevant) and was probably in that rack next to her for about 15 minutes

So I'm almost done with my workout, but she was talking to some dude (not some huge alpha guy, just some skinny guy like me talking about a class they have together or something). I didn't want to interrupt, so I set my phone with my jacket and went and got some water. I get a drink and see that she isn't talking to that guy anymore, and muster up all the courage I have to ask her, ""so your legs hurt like hell, right?"" I don't know why I said that. I mean, and that's all I could say. Whatever. 

Fortunately, but that's exactly what I was going for, so it's awesome."" And I agreed with her that it's one of the best feelings ever. She then commented on those ""weird behind the back squat things"" I was doing earlier (those hack squats). I told her that was the first time I'd ever done them and they were pretty different but I liked them a lot. She then asked if I had heard about some '44 body weight' workouts program that had been going around, and I told her I had not. She said she would send it to me. And at that point, I hand her my phone so she can put her number in it. Easy. So freaking easy. I gave her a reason to contact me, and I was in. That was it. 

I don't have any idea what will come of this. I don't really care. I'll definitely follow up and get her to go get drinks this weekend or something, it isn't one. Just talk. What's the worst that can happen?

All this crap I designed in my head and wasted time worrying about ? I was going up against one of the main rules of the game inherently. I was putting her on a pedestal. Don't take mental notes, for the intrinsic joy and rush of that action, it will be so much more powerful. Instead of feeding off some fake thing you read about and are trying to pull off, shes feeding off you and that leads to much more powerful emotions. You want to bring that girl back tonight? Tell her that, look her dead in the eyes and say what you want. Not to try and impress her to run some next level inception shit on her but because you want to do that.

We come back, it's over. 

Afterward my friends get mad at me telling me I ruined the night out. I told them I was tired of being the group of cheesy guys in room who stared at chicks, by bringing a girl over, I was doing them a favor. My stubborn friend who always tried to be the leader, but tried to hard to be cocky, tried to tell me I was wrong, by saying ""it was going perfectly fine you dumb ass, then you brought that bitch over here"" I told him all we where doing was staring at girls, and went home.

I will be going to the same bar next Friday. Not with my friends, but tonight was a breakthrough. My friends don't like my new, changed self, and they are going to have to see myself happier without them.

Awareness Radius (AR) is the area around you that you are aware of. For instance: A bear is eating in the backwoods as a little rabit hops past the predator's AR. The bear does not acknowlege its presences on account of the rabit's abject power. The bear is not threatened so he has no reason to watch the rabit.

The little rabit needs to watch out for everything and everyone or it will be killed. The rabit is threatened by dogs

On the other hand if another bear crosses the first bear's path, unless they are threatened.


Thus having a low AR shows dominance while a wide AR shows nervousness.

**How is this related to humans?**

Well, what do you do?

If you have a wide AR you will jerk your head quickly in the direction your name is being called. This shows weakness in that you turned your headquickly and you stopped your conversation to address your colleague.

If you have a narrow AR you will keep following the context of your conversation and you allow your colleague to call upon you after you are done talking.

Another example of wide AR is, you look at it. For instance, if you are reading a book and you see someone walk by, out of the corner of your eye, you look at it. How can you read a book if you look up every 3 seconds just to see who it is that is crossing your path?

Instead

**The Common Mistake**

The common mistake with AR is that people will try to ignore everyone. When they walk down the street, they haven't mastered it. Making eye contact shows stability and security vs. the AFC's shyness and insecurity.

**What is the Solution?**

The solution is to establish a good awareness range of vision (ARV). This way you don't act needy by snaping your head to a side just to see whats going on. You want to stay relax and project a calm and dominant image. Remember you are the bear

**How do I Establish a Good Awareness Range of Vision?**

To build a good ARV you must do the following exircise!

Step 1: First close your left eye.

Step 2: With your right eye

Step 3: Close your right eye.

Step 4: Now

The area inbetween these two boundaries is your range of vision which you should be aware of. If a cute girl (or any human being) is seen in your ARV

**Dont Always look to get laid.**
One of the big things I've taken from it is just go and have a good time. Looking back I realized mistakes I made like only wanting to go out if there was a chance I could pick up. After that mindset changed things fell into my lap (literally). 

Met up with an old college friend to catch up on things. While hanging out at the bar one of his friends joins us (HB8) so she joins us for a couple drinks having a fun time, but as I started to remember everytime this situation happens I would end up getting friendzoned so figured I got prevent it. So replied to her facebook message the next day saying ""yup, but I never use this txt me instead"" Phew avoided the whole facebook.

**Kino kino kino!**
So after texting back and forth we setup to go to a party together. After a couple drinks I noticed she started actually do kino to me! My biggest mistake I always make is I'm too shy to kino, still doing kino until she unbuttons her pants. Yay I think I'm finally going to make it, but get some LMR when I go to grab a condom. 

**Finally taking the Lead**
After that we hang out a couple times but nothing really progresses again, and I want it to continue, suggest we hang out that night, she's a little hesitant and says well I have to work till 9 then I'm not sure if I'm for much. Which I just respond with ""See you at 9 :)"" (Learned Girls Loving Smiley Faces haha), then stop talking to her for the rest of the day. I just show up at her work at 9, she see's me in the parking lot walks up and says ""you win"" and gets in the car. Go back to my place enjoy a couple drinks and decide to escalate. She ends up taking off my shirt and comments ""wow looks like you actually do go to the gym"" with that remark I say yup, pick her up and carry her to the bedroom (Felt like a Boss move to do - Highly recommend adding the gym to anyone's routine!) Things start to get hot and heavy again but before I reach **LMR** I played a move that I didn't even realize till after. Instead of just reaching for the condom I asked her should I grab one
*After all this I stumbled upon an escalation ladder on this reddit (can't remember the name) but it mentioned avoiding LMR by asking her if you should get a condom instead of just grabbing it
But after all is done and we are lying in bed chatting she says to me **""wow

Needless to say I felt like a Boss after it

Another funny note to take out of this, and I still pulled it off, so it appears **looks aren't everything!** Not to say I'm ugly but always been a little self concious and that realization has helped me, that I could pull it. Since then I've gotten dates with 2 other HB's, trying to avoid that oneinitis that gets talked about all the time

1369736252.0,1f6ww6,6 Things You Can Do Right Now to Get More Chicks,alexmatlock,210,52,44,"There are a lot of things out there that will directly affect your success with women. The items on this list are probably the easiest and quickest things you can apply right now in order to get almost instant results.


**1.    Believe That All Women Are Equal**


This is probably one of the best things you can EVER do. Think about the least attractive chick you’ve ever banged. Let’s say she was a 5 (out of 10) and that’s your absolute lowest standard. Wasn’t it easy to attract her? Of course it was


Now, this special treatment that you often give to “hotter” girls is what really stops you from scoring them.


If you’d believe that all women are equal, will be the one that actually allows you to attract them.


Make it your mission to see all girls the same. There’s no 10’s


**2.    Don’t Ask For Her Permission**


I see so many guys doing this that I actually laugh when it happens. They ask a girl “Do you want to dance? Can I kiss you? Can I have your phone number? What happened to just taking a girl on the dance floor? What happened to just saying “Give me your phone number so I/we can…” What happened to just going in for the kiss? And finally


Because most guys never get asked for their permission, scared of rejection and finally, it creates an awkward moment in which the girl actually has to think about kissing/dancing with you, an awkward moment in which she has time to think about how weak you are and come up with a way to reject you. This unnecessary moment could have been easily avoided just by DOING IT instead of asking her for permission.


**3.    Don’t Lean In During The Conversation**


This is another fundamental one which is commonly ignored. What guys need to realize is that by leaning in to listen to her every word they are basically telling the chick “I’m so glad I’m talking to you right now, in a venue where the music isn’t lout at all.


Take my word for it; you do not want her to know how excited you are when you’re talking to her. I get it that you are, that you don’t really get a lot of girls which ultimately means, you’re a loser.


You want her to think highly of you so just act cool and let her be the one that leans in. If you’ve made her interested


**4.    Embrace Rejection**


This is probably the most common issue guys have


Honestly


The only way to ever beat this fear of rejection is to expect it every time. If you’re absolutely sure that this girl will reject you, by the time you’re at your 6th girl you’re most surely going to have something good to say.


Finally, and if she rejects you, she just lost the best thing that could ever happen to her, so, there’s no point in drooling over this fact since she’s the only one that’s losing out.


**5.    Be A Man Of Mystery**


Most guys make offers (tell everything about them) in hopes that a chick will like them. This can sometimes land you the girl (if the offer is good enough and she’s somewhat materialistic) but not ALWAYS. If you’re a man of mystery


In order to play the man of mystery card


**6.    Don’t Be Boring**


Being boring doesn’t just apply to your conversation with her. Being boring is about yourself. If a chick sees you just standing there with your friends, watching the bar TV, she’ll already assume that you’re boring. By the time you get the courage to approach her, you’re already that boring guy that was just standing there a minute ago.


So, someone at the bar, anyone, just don’t act like you have nothing to do.


This is the sort of stuff I discuss on my blog and in the free eBook I give out. If you want to increase your success with women

Divorced 2007; two kids. no money (bankrupted by divorce...thank you NJ superior court!) 
When I first started to go out was in 2007. The first book I read was ""The game"" by neil strauss. At the time
So after first reading the game
So back on point, flying solo, opening sets, getting shot down, occaissionally having a success. This kept me going. Keep working on yourself NOT just your game. Have a life outside of the game. 
Last words for now: It took me six years of consistent ""practice"" to get where I am right now that I am able to pull the hottest girls in my age group. The woman I am dating right now is 45 yo, money, and disappointment was all worth it and I would do it again in a heartbeat. I only wish I knew about seduction and the game BEFORE I got married. I would have saved myself a whole lot of heartache and financial pain but that is a story for another day. Good luck to all you, the woman of your dreams is waiting for you!

1358024619.0,16gcx5,What Seddit can teach women- if they're open,EurekaShriek,206,50,80,"27/f here

After reading the comments of a previous female sedditor's ""insights"", not attempt to teach back with words- because what's taught in seduction is taught because it works. Actions speak louder than words. 

In the year I spent in New York sitting in on group field teaches and classes, I learned more about myself and my sexuality than any other time in my life. 

I slowly began to understand why I was attracted to assholes and not nice guys

A woman must first acknowledge that she's secretly looking for a social advantage in choosing a mate, that is, a woman must understand the evolutionary and instinctive drives in her sexuality if she wants or needs to overcome them. 

If I'm honest, confident, intelligent alpha male being dominating, charming, and witty- but those guys (who are like that naturally) typically exist without certain qualities that we women do honestly know are more important to living a happy life, like empathy, forethought, being nurturing

The seduction community, it also puts those same tools in the hands of intelligent, considerate, intelligent men who would otherwise continue being blown off by women. 

Women WANT to be seduced. We WANT to go on dates with men who make us feel relaxed and secure with them, and have real, genuine hobbies and thoughts to share, you allow us to enter a state we rarely are able to be in. Defenses down, genuine connection, honest enjoyment. 

Anyway my main point here is that I think the seduction community has a lot to offer women in terms of the sex positive movement. Many women struggle to truly discover who they are in terms of their sexual psychology

Sure we vary woman to woman

For me, only since having accepted that have I been able to develop my dominant side of my sexuality as well. 

Forcing women to understand themselves by looking at the ugly truths-
e.g. we don't like dating a guy shorter than ourselves, 
opens the door for us to actually accept ourselves, or however that was supposed to work. 

I think what seduction teaches can help everyone build confidence

Anyway
I should probably edit this

1312556388.0,j9wop,10 Lifestyle Tips,ArdentDrive,223,62,39,"If you're subscribed to Love Systems Insider

* **Lifestyle is the foundation that supports all your cool pickup skills (approaching, etc.).** With an attractive lifestyle, you can get away with more ""mistakes."" Guys who have terrible lifestyles can still be great with women - but they have much, much less room for error. Lifestyle isn't enough by itself, but it sure makes everything else easier.

* **Lifestyle begins at home. Your living situation says SO much about you to a woman

* **You are who you spend time with.** OK, or do you have an interesting life? For a woman, dating you means being part of your world. So introduce her to people and have friends who help you create a lifestyle that she wants to be part of.

* **Be more social and outgoing - every day.** Force yourself to meet one new person or have one social conversation you wouldn't normally have. For one thing, experience helps you become the person who intuitively knows ""the right thing to say"" in any situation.

* **If you want to date more than one woman at a time, and very social, a woman is much more likely to accept you having multiple relationships than if she sees you as someone who stays in every night on your computer.

* **Passion conquers all.** We all know or have heard of the guy who lives in his friend's basement but brings home attractive women any time he wants. To do this, making it as a musician, artist, or writer), going back to school, etc - then your lifestyle can fit and be attractive - even if you're in the basement. In other words, do not confuse lifestyle with wealth. They are not at all the same thing.

* **Your job is not an excuse.** Some jobs can be lifestyle killers. Whether you're working a million hours per week, your time is never your own, or if you have to live somewhere you don't want - these are real lifestyle problems. Unless it's part of your identity and passion (e.g., endless shifts at the hospital could be worth it if you're on your way to being a doctor and love medicine), fix this. There are other jobs. Even in this economy. Ironically, a lot of guys in these 75-hour workweeks got into these careers because they wanted a better lifestyle. Do above-average pay, expensive clothes, sure. But 9 times out of 10, change it. No one else will change it for you.

* **Lifestyle without pickup is boring or worse.** I said at the beginning of this that lifestyle is the foundation. The thing about a foundation is you have to build on it. Or else it's just a boring foundation. Pickup is what lets you convey your lifestyle and personality to beautiful women in a way that is attractive and interesting to her. Even if you've never met her before, most guys turn women off by being boring... they don't know the triggers and attraction switches to engage her emotionally, to keep that push/pull dynamic going, to make her qualify herself, and so on. Or, worse, they try to force their lifestyle down her throat and come as insecure and bragging. Since I started Love Systems, B-list celebrities, her automatic behavior and responses

* **Showing is better than telling. If you have to tell, introduce her to them. If you've got access to cool events, take her to them. And so on. Don't talk about something you could just as easily do. Sometimes you don't have this option - like when you're first meeting her. If there's something you really want her to know about you, it's often most effective to bait her into asking you about it. If I were a great salsa dancer, I might tell her a story about my friend Joe who I met at a dance show. The story would be short and having nothing to do with dance. But she's likely to wonder what a dance show is. I'd answer ""oh, I'm a salsa dancer. Do you dance?"" Now I've got two balls in the air. One is that she's going to want to know more about me being a salsa dancer. The other is that my question to her can either lead into some Qualification or Comfort-building depending on which direction I want to take it.

1369454635.0,1f0i51,[FR] #-closed a cute waitress by working on inner game,abslide,198,39,13,"Long time lurker

After trying to sarge at clubs in and around Boston
 

Tonight, and she reciprocated my big smile. Good sign #1: She asked us what we were celebrating, having clearly overheard my positive talk with the friend about finishing this big task. I told her about the project, and then we got into a discussion about her holding onto old notes and things after finishing something. I said I send everything past the recycle bin and deleted it for kicks, and noticed her laugh and move a little closer. I had a momentary thought about the reality that good-looking waitresses probably get hit on all the time, but recognized it as a limiting belief and evacuated it from my mind.


While my friend and I were hanging out, a smile naturally came onto my face, and I said: ""teach me how to do that straw folding thing."" She explained it and then said ""thanks for noticing."" I negged her by saying she obviously stole it from someone else at the restaurant, and by George it worked! More laughter, and it seemed like she actively enjoying a guy teasing her - a big plus.


She kept making eye contact as she worked her route around the bar, a ""yeah, definitely"" and a number in return.

1342916008.0,wy1nh,It's Saturday night. Who needs some motivation?!,captaingoodtimes,186,29,31,"It's Saturday night. Who's the lucky girl you're taking home with you?

If you're anything like me you're probably the kind of guy who wants it all. And why shouldn’t we all be that way? We’re only on this planet for a finite number of years and our youth only lasts so long. Why waste it settling for something sub-par. You've probably convinced yourself that having an active social life and sleeping with beautiful fun girls isn't all its cracked up to be. I used to think that. Guess what? I was DEAD WRONG. It is fucking awesome. 


Advice to the new guys. Anything worth having takes work. Keep doing it, and keep learning. You'll get better. I know it seems weird or unnatural at first but to get something you’ve never had you’re gonna have to do something you’ve never done. When Sean Connery was filming his first the James Bond film the director noticed he looked awkward on camera when he wore his signature tuxedo. He asked why he looked so stiff. To which Mr. Connery replied that he isn’t used to wearing one so it feels weird. The director told him to take the tux home with him, wear it every day and even sleep in in it. Basically don’t take it off. By being in the tuxedo 24/7 he got used to wearing it, and thus looked more natural on camera. 

Some of the moments I regret the most in my life are when I failed to make a move for no other reason than I was a goddamn pussy. This is why I always approach now, that’s the shit that keeps me up at night.


You see a dude your age walking down the street with a beautiful girl on his arm and naturally you think what does that guy have that I don’t? He’s so lucky. For starters he’s probably in better shape because he has discipline and works hard and it’s also safe to assume he makes more money that you because he’s more assertive in his professional life. But it’s also likely that this girl didn’t just walk up to him and jump on his dick. He had to approach. Just like you.


Most guys figure that their perfect girl/wife/partner will just show up one day and everything will work out. This is false. The OPPORTUNITY will present itself but you’ll undoubtedly fuck it up if you have no idea what to do or someone else shows up and steals your thunder. If someone offers you a chance to shoot a free throw for a million dollars but you’ve never once shot a basketball


So go out tonight. Approach as many girls as possible with the aim of just having a good fucking time. Get drunk. Dance like you own the place. Girls love to have a good time, and get over it. You’re gonna let some drunk bitch bruise your ego? Fuck no you’re not. You’re better than that. You’re awesome and she sucked. Move on to the next girl. Your girl is there, you just having talked to her yet.

Ten years from now you’ll be telling all people about this. Because trust me, and only you, to decide right now whether it’ll be an epic story, or a mere fact, a mundane occurrence; another stupid footnote in an otherwise boring and uninteresting life. I can imagine nothing more depressing than someone who is fine playing a supporting role in their OWN life story, who sits in a corner watching everyone else doing awesome shit, assuming all they have to do is just wait their turn. A man who doesn’t dare greatly will never know the thrill of victory, no one will never remember his name. So if not now, if they only knew…..

I know that she hooked up with guys (hell, I even know guys who hooked up with her) and I had my chance, but I blew it.  

I am having a hard time getting over this, and beat myself up over it.  Furthermore, I can't stand the fact that it seems like every other guy has been successful with her.  

This is ego rearing it's ugly head, making them the prize as your ego has been hurt. 

It's a shitty place to be, and you keep digging yourself deeper and deeper.  It comes to the point where she's just a reminder of your failures.

**The Cock-Blocking Girlfriend**

I'm finding myself in group settings a lot more than usual lately. After meeting up with a friend for wings

Upon arrival, and then stepped back to see the group dynamics.

One technique that I often do at a house where I don't know too many people is to make broad jokes to the group

There were two girls standing on the other side of a wooden table with writing on it. It appears to be tradition at this house to sign the party table.

The host

The hunt was a team scavenger hunt with clues and instead of eggs

As John was explaining the rules

She was watching as I took the marker that was lying there

After making the mark I looked up and acted like I didn't know I was being watched. ""Oh, it's really not that size at all. I've seen it."" I remarked.

She smiled and let out a surprisingly loud laugh. I was in.

I started to chat with her about the liquor hunt that was about to take place. ""You guys don't stand a chance

She laughed

""You want to make a wager?""

""Ok

""10 miniature bottles of vodka says I'll win.""

""I don't have 10 miniature bottles of vodka!"" She played along.

""You don't *yet*.""

She laughed as I put my hand out to shake. That's when the friend sprung into action.

""Don't touch my friend. She's not here for you."" Her friend chided with a nasty tone as she grabbed the cute girls arm away from my handshake. There was no humor in her voice. She was unimpressed with me. Worse, *you can't flirt with this guy*.

""She's not here for me? Why is she here?"" I asked.

The bitchy one had an ugly look of disgust on her face as she tried to answer the simple question I posed.

""She's here for me."" she replied.

""Oh.. I get it. Please go on... I've already got a half-chub just thinking about this..."" In some contexts this statement wouldn't have been received well

And then we were off. The doors were opened and the battle began.

One great advantage to gaming in groups/parties is the dynamics regularly subject people to you. At a bar, and it's difficult to re-approach despite your outcome.

Groups and parties are different. You can wear people down. Talk to people, by the second or third conversation, she'll be warmed up and talk to you like one in her inner circle.

I was teamed up with my friend as we wandered the property searching for the tiny bottles of vodka, but it's effective.

""Oh hey you two! Did you get the clue about Bug's Bunny's favorite phrase?"" I pointed at the hint sheet for the scavenger hunt.

""Yeah

[Yes

**Does it work?**

[Yes, you cannot help but get better at it, and attracting the opposite sex is no different.

Less than you think. Reading, but be terrible in the real world. The general consensus among sedditors who've made it through to the other side (where ""the other side"" means, ""able to meet and attract high quality women with regularity""), is that reading one or two beginner books is all you really need to get started. Reading more books, beyond the basics, will probably do less for your game than one night out in the field. More valuable, is getting into the field, and then reporting back to your peers here at seddit in the form of field reports and questions about your stumbling points.

Some well-respected commercial beginner materials are *Magic Bullets*, like [*The Book of Pook*](http://www.scribd.com/doc/3536110/The-Book-of-Pook).

I won't lie, I've finally managed to learn what this is and isn't. I'm hoping that this thread will clear up some misconceptions and illuminate some pitfalls.

Now, have a good time, and nail lots of chicks, this post probably isn't for you, but I think there's something everyone can draw from this thread.

**WHAT ONEITIS IS**

Oneitis is when you find yourself pining over a single woman who is unobtainable. You hold her up as a pinnacle as all you hold beautiful in this world, but they can also be things like Job Offers, Vacations, going out with friends, etc. The rationale behind this is almost always, ""I'm just waiting for her to come around"", or some variation there of. Fuck that! She isn't responsible for your happiness! YOU ARE! So get out there and do something about it!

In a nutshell


* ""itis"" is a suffix used to denote a pathological issue. The actual

* 99% of Oneitis cases are ex-post-facto, and now you're caught up on her.

* This is bad because you're focusing your energies on a girl that you cannot obtain. It screws with your inner game

* Oneitis keeps you from functioning at your peak. You're funneling energy into a black hole. This is energy that you should be putting into meeting other women

* In the rare case that you develop Oneitis while dating a girl, personality, etc, you have Oneitis. if anything comes of your efforts with the current girl, it will crash and burn in a spectacular way, and you'll be kicking yourself for not admitting to yourself that it wasn't a good match and missing out on all those other girls that now have boyfriends.

**WHAT ONEITIS IS NOT**

* Oneitis is not simply dating one girl at a time. Some people prefer the simplicity. You don't have to let down anyone else if things work out

* Oneitis is not wanting or pursuing an LTR. 

* Oneitis is not being in a closed relationship.

* Oneitis is not having stronger feelings for one girl over another


**here's what fellow Sedditor nycprowl has to say on the subject**

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

&gt;**ONEITIS IS NOT THE SAME THING AS INTIMACY**

&gt;This seems to be the biggest issue newbies seem to have a hard time wrapping their head around. Because you're into a girl

&gt;When people here say ""kill off oneitis"", if the feelings are mutual, you don't have oneitis and you don't have to become all closed off if you're looking for a girlfriend. It only becomes a problem when the girl has rejected you or you've friendzoned yourself, and you can't get past her... meanwhile she is not interested in being with you.

&gt;Please, but with the response of the post in question, it's obvious that the topic is one that confuses some. 

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**WHY IT MATTERS**

In the second thread I linked to above, I feel for you dude, and all I can say is to keep on going and don't let it happen again; You know what you want now. There's nothing to be ashamed of, =)

There's no shame in wanting an LTR, and passing up other awesome women and depriving said women of an awesome guy. It's selfish and inconsiderate on multiple levels.

Hell, If you develop feelings for a girl along the way, THAT'S OKAY!


I guess I've said all of that to say this:

Emotions themselves are like guns; inert and have no power to act in and of themselves: It's what we do with them that matters. Emotion gives us passion, not your lack, of emotion that makes you attractive. There's a time and a place for everything. Come out and say what you want; playing it safe is not going to get you what you want. You have to take risks to find happiness and success. This applies to everything, not just dating.

**in closing:**

* Be honest with yourself about what you want. If you want to fuck girls and have One night stands, or to make your own offer. If you don't know what you want, then consider taking some time off to seriously consider your motives. You'll have a more positive impact on your life and the lives of those around you.

* Be honest with others. If you just want casual sex

* If you change your mind about either one of these, and there's no surefire way of developing oneitis than to keep sleeping with a girl you've developed feelings for that she will never reciprocate.

* leash your emotions, but know how far to let them go.

Passive Value is one of my most favorite aspects of the game. For those of you that don’t know what I’m talking about

This is the 360-degree display of your value that is developed beforehand (or faked in-field IF you’re still in the training wheels phases of learning newbiedom)

It incorporates:
* Subcommunication
* Body Language
* Fashion
* Social Proof
* Lifestyle
* Status

Think about celebrities like Leonardo DiCaprio; all they have to do is exist in a club and women will be attracted to them. Why? Because they have proven their worth through their accomplishments (film, etc.) and the popularity, wealth, and power that comes from those accomplishments is public knowledge, thereby making them (through their passive value) extremely attractive.

Of course

* Creep
* Stalker
* Predator

or worse:

* A lonely and desperate guy!

This includes proper body language, but important, elements. Whenever I’m out with my students, I spend quite a bit of time focusing on this because I believe that it can truly make or break your opener.

Without further ado, and interesting to the women you’re about to approach and hopefully NOT creepy.

**#1: Stop Leaning Against The Bar**

Again, looking for something? You wouldn’t be.

You would be smiling and laughing with your friend(s), when a girl gives you the casual walk-by, your “Hey, quick question. My friend and I were just talking about…” will seem realistic.

Believe it or not

“No

Solution: Squaring off (i.e. bodies directly facing each other), but stay fun, light-hearted and engaged. Women want to meet guys that have better things to do than pick up girls (ironically), so show them that you’re not there to pick up girls (even if you are) by having fun with your wing in the interim.

Exception: Here’s a quote by our long term training coach Gareth Jones

“Do not lean up against the bar unless you are talking to a girl

**#2: Stop Looking Around**

This is HUGE for me, not like the guy that’s out to have fun with his friends. You know when you see that girl all by herself, looking around and it sets off that “GO GET HER!” instinct in your head?

Yeah, but it sets off their “That guy is a predator or creep” instinct, instead. When you’re looking around for girls to open, all the girls you’re ignoring because they’re with their boyfriends are seeing you looking like a predator and are putting you in the “Wouldn’t” category. Maybe you don’t care about them, but when they point you out to their single friend that just came back from the bathroom, you’ve just blown yourself out of that set.

Solution: Use your peripheral vision to spot targets: Look over his shoulder, you can make your move straight away. You can even have him spot targets for you, or the other way around.

**#3: Stop Being Too Cool for School (ie Asian Poker Face)**

Again, thus making you feel better, or about how smiling at a woman causes her to smile at you, which makes you more attractive to every other woman (!!), but I’m not gonna.

I’m simply going to ask how you can tell if a guy is having fun with his friend(s) at a bar and how you can tell that he’s confident

The point of passive value is to show that your default (non-creepy) personality is attractive to a woman and, or the one smiling, telling him to relax? Who’s more confident: the guy with a frown on his face, alone at the bar, or the guy with a smile, chatting with his buddy? Exactly.

Solution: Smile. Just do it. In times of crippling fear or overwhelming uncertainty: smile. In boring or underwhelming times: smile. In times of extreme anger: Smile. If you’re still having trouble

Saying the words themselves will force you to form a smile. BAM said the lady!

There you go! Those are the three most common detractors from passive value that I run into over and over again. Take this article to heart

1358130687.0,16iz1y,"State, dopamine, and becoming more alpha",bvcxxcvb,208,44, so here goes:

**What it is:** ""State"" is a feeling of flow and resourcefulness in which you are outside of your head and have good energy. Hard to describe. The best metaphor I can think of, I would say that *motivation* is increased.

**How does it help?** Being more motivated, energetic, etc), job interviews, sports plays, academic tests, stretches during creative work

Focusing on the latter, it's like being in a trance and everything just flows out ever so perfectly. 

**Really though, and more recently, motivation, in humans and animals. You get a spike of dopamine after a good meal; about twice as much after sex; and 3-4 times that of sex when you do a line of coke (I'll talk about implications in a bit). *EDIT - there is more than dopamine going on chemically; norepinephrine is also probably there, as are others, so just keep in mind when I say ""dopamine"" I'm referring to a variety of neurotransmitters that have upper effects*

I think we evolved to naturally release dopamine in certain scenarios to increase our resourcefulness and effectiveness as human beings. Seduction should definitely be one of them; women are wooed by wit and charisma, and make a witty joke? To have the audacity to physically pick her up and move her around for fun. You get the idea! Now think if you've ever done those kind of actions when you were feeling like shit; a good opposite scenario is the ""morning fog"" us non-morning people experience. 

**How can I get in state?** Good question, and eat a balanced diet - high protein foods should help because certain amino acids are precursors to dopamine, and AAs come from protein. 

Now, drop and do a set of push-ups. Something else: when I read something I find very interesting or exciting. I like thinking about my work because I'm very passionate about it. Ok, so what about at the club or bar? I find humor to be good. This is where some routines can help - have something you can say to your friends or even open a set with, that you yourself find funny and maybe can get others to laugh. 

A big thing for me is to *force conversation*. I am an introvert; that doesn't mean I don't like talking to people, it's like I'm revving up my brain. I just saw a really good post on here that reiterated something I sorta do: ""nouning"". Start off a conversation, listen to their response, focus on one of the nouns they use, and say something about that noun. Here's the link to the post in question: http://www.puaforums.com/how-flirt/3736-simple-art-conversation.html

Perhaps the most important part is *momentum*. Working up. I was at a dinner dance the other night, ""Hey we're gonna go find some girls to talk to"". So we walk around, not getting much done, until eventually we're dancing around some chicks and I tap one on the arm and introduce myself (to be fair I was trying to set a good example). Bam. It was over. Rest of the night went amazing. 

I should mention that I think there are bad ways to get into state. Everything I've talked about so far has been more or less natural. Have you ever recovered so perfectly from morning fog with a well-timed coffee? There you go - stimulants get you into state. I don't want to say coffee is bad I just want to draw a point: when you're in the club

This is one reason people in this community adopt the rule ""No drugs until you're in state"". Because once you get there

**Why do these things get me into state?** Let's start with stimulants

A quick detour which will help lead to my thesis: there are many studies stating that alpha males of tribes have more dopamine. They are the winners: they have taken risks

Think about something like humor. Who can afford to joke around and have a good time often, i.e. make sexy-time. See the link I posted at the bottom for a related study on potential reward/dopamine correlations. 

Why do I think something like humor can be alpha? It's the opposite state of stress, having a good time, while the peasants worried about the roof over their head. *Which group do you think a girl would be drawn towards back then?*   

Another action that's very different from humor which I think would have the same effect is setting personal boundaries. You're at the bar with a mixed group of friends. One of your friends starts cracking jokes about some mental condition. You get all serious, I know people who are like that, it's not a joking matter. Cut that shit out."" ""But isn't it really funny how they always - "" ""Shut the fuck up Jimmy."" Now you sit back down and cut the tension by changing topics to something of your choosing. You know what kind of people don't tolerate shit they don't like? Of course you do. Ever done something similar to this and felt that pump you get from seizing status and control? Don't forget to have a one-on-one talk with Jimmy later to stay friends though. 

**Ways to increase dopamine in general?** I've got a few ideas. For one, browsing facebook, or doing other unproductive bullshit. I am not sure if ""state"" as we've been calling it is a limited resource, but I at least feel that after an amazing night it's extra hard to recover the next day if I've been in heavy state. I also talked about the natural sleep/exercise/diet trifecta which should really be more important to you than something you shrug off just because everyone says it. I'm also generally against stimulants - even caffeine. I think these can be short-term performance enhancers to use occasionally, yes, but I think it's important you train your *baseline* (i.e. practice getting into state, maintaining it, etc) rather than relying on stimulants.

**What about testosterone?** I found a really good quote online that summarizes my present mental model on the relationship between T and what we've discussed:

""While testosterone creates the drive for status, it is dopamine that allows a man achieve these things. It is dopamine that creates the hedonistic, pleasure seeking bad boy. It is dopamine that creates the extroverted, social, charmer. It is dopamine that creates the competitive, aggressive corporate hard-charger.""

**Other thoughts and implications.** There's this effect I feel sometimes (which I alluded to above) that arises from state mismatches. When you are in state, it can almost feel like *this is not me*. That was *someone else* who did those things. I experience this with quite a few of my interactions with others - sometimes I just leave such a good impression that I feel I simply can't follow up. This creates a fair bit of anxiety and nervousness unfortunately. 

You feel like you always have to be ""on"", your good state *must* come from a stress-free place. And oftentimes this is no easy feat. Alpha males are outcome-independent, but clearly you are reaching for an outcome here, so... Something's gotta give. Perhaps over time your *baseline state* (and thus chemical levels) mature to something more desirable as you gain more life experience and your brain - your subconscious brain - starts to realize that. 

Like everything worthwhile in life

At the end of the day, or long-term ""alpha conditioning"" as I alluded to above. 

I very much look forward to hearing your feedback

Lets say you're out at the club or a party or something. The cute girl you are interested in is also there. She may have even invited you out that night. One thing you have to remember is that you cannot make it seem like that was your only option for the night. If she appears to be ignoring you.. or being a bitch to you.. **DO NOT** sit there and wait around like a chump

If you aren't having fun.. if its boring... just leave! The girl WILL sense that you aren't having a good time and she will lose respect for you that you choose to stay. Show her that you are the prize and that you have other options! Don't be a dick about it. Just walk up to her

In the last week I have done this twice to a HB9 that I used to wait around for. The results have been incredible. Recently whenever she sees me shes me she won't leave me alone. Asking me how that other party was or how that one club was and if it had fun

So to recap: Just make sure YOU are having fun. If you aren't

1376375861.0,1k9i86,[FR] From strangers to F-Close in 2 days,atsif,187,35,43,"Hey seddit. I'm extremely new to the community. Just recently I decided to read up on some seduction techniques to refine my game. I had gotten by pretty well with what I guess some might call natural game

Over the weekend I went to a house party with a girl that I had picked up in the mall and a close friend of mine. The party was pretty small, adjusted her hair a lot. She told me her name was Claire and I playfully told her that I had bad experiences with girls named Claire (would this be considered a neg? Not too sure). She laughed and assured me that she was one of the good Claires.

The party went on and I hung out with the girl I had come with for a little bit. I did not try to hide that I was there with this girl and had my arm around her for much of the party. She had to go escort her drunk friend home, I don't really remember what she was talking about, but at some point at a natural pause in conversation, I took out my phone, put it on the keypad screen, and handed it to her, without offering an explanation. She looked at me and said ""Are you serious?"" I said yes and she asked ""Why do you want my number?"" At first I think I just brushed off the question and said something along the lines of ""I just want it"" until she said ""Give me a real reason."" I told her that I thought she was cute and that we should hang out some time. As a joke

Keeping in mind the texting techniques that I had learned from seddit, so I think girls my age are used to having all day text conversations with guys they talk to) but kept the conversation short and immediately moved on to making plans. I avoided asking her when she was free and instead said. ""Let's hangout tomorrow! Come over to my place tomorrow."" It was probably a little risky to suggest meeting at my place so early on, and she showed just a little bit of resistance by saying ""Yeah, or we could go out for lunch lol"" I replied ""No, we shouldn't go out to lunch"" and explained my opinion on dinner/movie first dates. I always say something along the lines of ""Dinner and movie dates don't let you talk and get to know the person you're on a date with."" I highly recommend this. I have not once had a girl say something other than ""I agree with you"" because otherwise she comes off as someone who's just looking for a free meal. This saves you money and lets you get personal with a girl early on. She agreed, so I told her to be at my house around 1.

Something came up earlier today, knowing that I had still opened the conversation for sexual topics. We talked for a bit longer and then I used another line that I read on seddit and said ""I'm going to kiss you now."" She smiled and leaned in.

We walked around the park for a little bit and sat down in a new spot. This time she brought up the conversation of sex as it related to her in past relationships. She mentioned that she believed it was better to wait for sex. I told her I disagreed and she mentioned that she would once made a guy wait four months for sex. I mentioned that I would not be in that guy's position and she asked me ""So if I held out on you

It either hurts or is just numb. And, I hate competition and the thought of it -- I'm terrified of other men, and I just know I'm going to get shot down with some quip or even get beat up in a club if I tried to play pickup there.

So I dunno...I guess you might advise me to do ""inner game"" stuff until I'm happy with myself

I was raised by my mom as an only child, like a woman...I had this strong ""ew run away a girl"" impulse. But I'm heterosexual -- I beat off furiously to images of women, and only fantasized about girls. Men just don't do it for me.

Basically, you can't fool them into thinking your genes are of a higher quality than they are. I'm being selected out of the gene pool, because I don't have attractive qualities. I'm a sexual failure, basically. I wish I could be good with women, but I just can't. I don't feel good about myself. And this whole thing is just depressing. There's no solution :/

1351691249.0,12ebt7,[FR] Halloweekend,bajing,206,56,50,"Greetings Sedditors

For your reading convenience I will break this post up into 2 different sections and will include the lessons of each day at the end of the day so you may come back and read it at your leisure. I think there are some really important lessons for newbies in here so pay attention. 

****
Day 1: Throwing a party in my room. 

Recently I've been number closing tons of chicks and then friendzoning about half of them so I could throw a successful party. All my investments in these women finally came to fruition on this day. 

Me and my roommates got a bunch of halloween decorations, tube shots, plastic halloween cups etc etc) we were good to go. 

So the day before the party I compile a list of all the HB's i'd number closed in the last month and had established some rapport with (I think the number was like 67). I mass texted all of them that there was going to be a halloween party in my room and that they should make plans to come over. I got about a 45% response rate on the text

At this point I put my costume on, and I was the host of the party. 

I settle in with one girl I'd never seen before easily an HB9, and I decided to play the friends off of each other. I kept talking about how cool HB8 was while I escalated Kino with HB9. HB9 started to get jealous because it seemed like I was more into HB8 and she literally lunged for my face when I asked her if she would like to kiss me. 

We hooked up for the remainder of the night, turned me around and made out with me hardcore. I'd obviously struck a nerve in their friendship and I fully intended to take advantage of it. She told me her feet hurt (she was a slutty nurse, in super high heels) so I told her we could go into my room so she could sit down. 

You can imagine the rest. 

Lessons:

1: When throwing a party ensure that you have lots of booze (NEVER DO BYOB)

2: Have party favors

3: Being the host of a GOOD party gives you massive social proof. Girls texted me the entire next day saying how much fun they had and told me to text them for my next party

4: Jealousy is one of the most powerful emotions a human can feel

5: Obviously this was Halloween so peoples inhibitions are lowered

****

Day 2: Bro night

I wake up with a hangover that rivals all that I've ever had before. The HB9 is sleeping next to me and I smiled remembering her

After nursing my hangover for half the day I decide that I'm all partied out and want to just hang out with some bros. So we all get together around 9pm and go to a buddy of mines apartment. We're just having a good time listening to music when a buddy of mine brings in some girls. The ratio is terrible

One thing I've noticed in these environments is that women will cluster together and guys seeing this are very weary to approach. I having conquered the worst of my AA long ago, an asian HB8 and open with the best opener of all time!!!!!!!!!! ""What are you supposed to be"" haha. 

She explains her costume, asks about where I live, my name, where I'm from etc etc. I tease her again asking if she's interviewing me, she tells me screens all her ""potentials"". I knew I was in but I wanted to keep her wanting more so I said ""Hey sweetie I gotta go talk to my friends now, but your cool so you should give me your number"". She gets this sad look on her face but puts her number in my phone and makes me promise to text her. I tell her I'm going to kiss her before I leave and her eyes go wide but she leans forward and I give her a quick kiss. Then leave as if nothing happens. 

After this I go bro out a little bit more

I continue broing out, sexy time ensues!

Lessons:

1: Just because a party is a sausage fest does not mean you should not approach

2: I was pretty out of state when I opened this set but I have a rule that if I see an HB that's cute I have to approach. Pretty much Mystery's Three Second Rule

3: Use Push Pull. Get her number, but shrug off the fact that she's leaving. This constant back and forth will make her desire you even more. 

4: Don't stress about openers, get her talking from there who knows where you will go. 

I have more stories about the last 2 days of the hurricane weekend but this is long enough.

Hope all my fellow college sedditors had a great weekend! Let's see some more field reports on your successes. ",,t5_2qhrv,False,frflair,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/12ebt7/fr_halloweekend/
1329675401.0,pwmsl,[FR] First kclose ever. Picture inside.,Mo3,185,37,67,"**First of all

I called my best friend (who happens to be a super-AFC and is in a ""relationship"" with a LSE-LD) and told him that we were going out. He hesitated for a good 10 minutes until he finally agreed. 

I picked him up from his house and during the drive

Before we entered the club

We sat down at the bar and checked out everyone. One AMOG, do you think my friend here looks gay? Some dumb cow called him gay before. I mean, what the hell?""). I instructed him on the basic rules of kino and started to drive light kino on the girls we were talking to.

After 2 hours, it's not a big surprise, at all. We demonstrated our Alpha status all the time and acted like we were the shit. 

A set of 4 started to move closer to us on the dance floor, he didn't have the balls to approach them (neither did I), so we just continued dancing. The thin blonde moved closer and closer, until she ""accidentally"" grinded on my friend's cock. I whispered ""Game's on."" in his ear. 5 minutes later he's dancing with her, 10 minutes later they make out. My buddy probably thinks I'm a fucking guru now. Truth is, I don't know shit and fear still affects (affected) my game.

Now, I continued to dance and not give a shit. Well, I gave a little bit of shit, because my goal that night was a kclose and I was sure as hell going to get one. 

So I turn my head to the left and spot a cute girl next to me in a dress. I think ""why not"" and approach her.

**Mo3:** Well

**HB:** *giggles* Yeah

**Mo3:** Sure, isn't it? (I start kino by touching her back, while crapping my pants because I am/was really really scared of touching girls)

**HB:** Noooo

*At this point, and I nearly blacked out thinking about what could've happened. But nothing happened. She just smiled at me and grabbed my back. I was amazed.*

*5 minutes of dancing, guys.. prove that you can rock this night"" (thank you by the way, DJ). I thought ""god be with me""  and went in for the kiss. She didn't pull back, though she was a little bit surprised at first. Didn't matter to me, I pulled her closer and kissed her again. 

**Insert another 15 minutes of grinding

After that I excused myself

Well, and it was my first kiss too. I still had huge AA and fear of touching and rejection, but I ignored my feelings for a few minutes and got rewarded. This game has just started..

1301664496.0,ggd3k,Seddit guide: The importance of dressing well!,HowToDressWell,194,43,151,"Hey there seddit

To fix this I'd recommend heading over to [malefashionadvice](http://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice) then READING the sidebar

A list of quick and dirty tips you can do right [now](http://www.lifehack.org/articles/lifestyle/newbie-fashion-tips-for-grown-up-men.html)

But first

I'd recommend going on there and other fashion forums

One thing though

This is because they're trying to teach you the basics, someone might recommend you 501 levis, but I personally wouldn't go for levis 501 STF(because they don't compliment very skinny people well), I'd go for 511s or 510s. 

Just because they recommend something like desert boots, though this is the minority. Just because it works for them it doesn't mean it works for you. If you're from MFA, don't get butthurt.

**The users on the sidebar all know what they're doing

Being fashionable isn't really as expensive as you think

Dressing well is **CRUCIAL**, I am social and cool."" Even attractive chicks pay attention to a guy who is dressed really fashionably. **It's an INSTANT DHV** that you don't even need to communicate.

You do not need to dress flashy or with logos to be fashionable, and being well fitted pretty much displays that you're so alpha and prestigious that you don't even need any ""brand"" or any shit to show off. It's a counter signal(think of like how someone who has a lot of girls to hang out with doesn't care about one girl, so you signal that you don't care because you have so many more options). Dressing better in no logos makes you stand out MORE.

Here's a quick example

What do you think when you see this guy?

So, which I largely chop up to being overweight and out of practice.

Had a girl a few weeks back that showed definite interest

So last night, her, and her best friend. We were both drunk. We danced a bunch and made out a little. She even gave me a lap dance and rubbed my junk through my pants.

Before long, left her in my care for the night. She was drunk as well as I, and that's when she really got crazy. She started crying about how everyone had left her and I was the only one who stuck around.

She tried to get in her car and drive away, which I refuse to do. I eventually get pretty pissed off, but I succeed in getting her into a cab. She refuses to tell me where she lives, and rather demands that we go to another coworker's house. I don't know where she lives, so I figure going to the friends house is the best option (I should have just brought her to my place, but it was trashed).

So we go to the other coworker's house, I end up trying to sleep on the couch, but I'm kept up all night by the sound of them fucking, with a deep feeling of shame for allowing myself to be treated in such a way.

Now I'm sitting her, and trying to think about how I should fix it. My main idea is to put my social life on the backburner, and focus strickly on fitness and weight loss for atleast the next 6 months. I'm muscular, but I'm 280lbs, so it doesn't really help me much.

I am neurotic to a good degree

I would have some success with girls

I've always liked myself

A few things happened to help me develop more confidence. I was able to recognize what was good about me and not good about me. This means physically and personality. I was blessed with some good features, working on social cues, realizing that I am truly funny, and realizing it's HEALTHY to pursue girls. I don't use too much of this seduction stuff besides basic principles, but whenever I heard PUA, I figured, ""scumbag"".

It's not necessarily about just getting to sleep with the girl either. Those can be fun but building your own self worth is so critical to the next step in a possible relationship and in life. I couldn't believe I was dating this one girl recently who was pretty much a babe. And I remember thinking

One thing too..maybe the most important thing. Even if you are typically like how I described myself in the first line of the post (self deprecating, you can't get everyone, that's ok! You'll get more if accept that you win some and lose some). This girl is in love with him because when she asks him, ""why do you do what you do""...he just responds, ""Because I like it"". He is sure in himself, and that's where the confidence actually kicks in. 

Macho doesn't equal confidence. Trusting yourself, and loving yourself are some of the keys. 

What about what specifics work with girls? What do they like? Etc. It doesn't matter too much. That comes with instincts and experience and common sense. Some were given more than others so work with it

1) Find what you are good with and not so good with.

2) Adjust accordingly

3) If you aren't typically confident

4) Love and value yourself 

Remember

1296153193.0,fa6l0,What Women Have to Say About Guys,MaysonNSS,213,62,113,"**Have you ever been curious as to what women find most attractive about a guy?**
I wanted to hear from the mouths of several beautiful women what their opinions were on what is attractive

1.	What are the 3 most attractive qualities you look for in a guy?

2.	What can a guy do that makes a GOOD first impression

3.	How do you define a “confident male?”

4.	What is the most unattractive quality in a guy?

5.	Do you prefer a dominate man or a submissive man when it comes to sex

6.	Is it important that the guy you are with is confidence when it comes to sex? Why

7.	How important is confidence in the guy you are with/like (Scale of 1-10 and why)

8.	How important is their looks (Scale of 1-10)

9.	If you were to offer dating advice to a guy what ONE tip would you give them


The age range of girls that I polled was 19-29 and I sent these questions out to them and asked them to be 100% open and honest. 

**According to women THE MOST attractive qualities are.**

The women that took part in this survey were VERY consistent in their answers. None of the women knew each other but every woman who took this survey listed 1 of the 3 qualities they find attractive as confidence. Guy’s have heard for a long time now that confidence is a very important quality to possess but a lot of them cannot answer why confidence is so attractive. Furthermore they cannot tell you how to bring about confidence. Some guys give the “fake it till you make it” advice when it comes to confidence but women are perceptive and they can spot a fake confidence a mile away. 

Other traits that women listed to be amongst the most attractive are: a good sense of humor (ranked very high)

**Women think that a good first impression should include.**

It’s often said you never get a second chance to make a first impression. I wanted to ask women what makes a good first impression and the results might surprise you.  One woman said

*“Don’t be too obvious and invasive

This is interesting because most guys go into a conversation with a woman from a place of insecurity and fear of rejection. This woman suggestion that subtly and tasteful compliments make a good impression. She also mentions finding out if there is a spark between them. From my perceptive, generating attraction isn’t something you do…. Attraction is something you are. I believe ultimately this girl is saying the “spark” she is after is an emotional response to something. Let’s face it not all guys give women positive emotional responses. 
Let’s see what other women had to say about first impressions.  Most women polled said they want a guy to make them laugh and be fun. One women said

*“make me laugh


I have said for a long time that fun is the ultimate attractor for women. Women want to laugh and have fun and when you can do that it leaves a positive first impression. This doesn’t mean you need to be a standup comedian but it does show confidence to display your personality. 

**How Women Define a “Confident Male”.**

Guys struggle to define a confidence male

*“Confidence is most obvious to me through body language. Especially when a guy is around other guys/in a group is when I can tell if they are confident with themselves or have something to prove”*

This woman said that confidence is most obvious through body language. Here she is saying there is a visual component to confidence. She also goes on to say that when a guy is around other guys she can tell if they are confidence or if they have something to prove. This insinuates there is another component to confidence as well. Women are very perceptive and if you are displaying arrogance rather than confidence it obviously hurts you. Another woman said

*“Someone that knows what he wants and knows his self worth”*


I often define confidence as the value that you place on yourself. Value broken down is the relative worth or importance you place on something. This woman is 100% correct in her definition of a confident male. These traits that women define as “confident” are right on and guys need to learn how to display them from an authentic place or they will miss out on the most attractive trait a guy can have. 

**Women Think That The Most Unattractive Trait is.**

Without a doubt every woman said the most unattractive trait is… Arrogance. Arrogance is often confused for confidence when it comes to guys and so it is vital that guys understand the difference between the two traits. Arrogance will push women away and confidence will create attraction. Women also mentioned that being over sexual in your comments is unattractive as well. I agree

**Do Women Prefer A Dominant or Submissive Man In Bed.**

Think you know the answer?
Out of all the women polled

**Do women Think Confidence is Important When it Comes to Sex?**

Answer? A resounding YES. Every woman added that it is important that the guy is open to new things and new experiences. Confidence should not be mistaken for perfection. Guys don’t need to be perfect at something but they should be confidence and open to new things.  One woman added

*“If they don't really know what they're doing

Confidence is not about being god’s gift to women; let’s face it I already have that covered.  In all seriousness

**How Important is Confidence to Women?**

I asked the women polled to rate how important confidence is in the guy they are with from a scale of 1-10. Collecting the data the average of all the women together was 9 out of 10. Women had a lot to say when it came to this question. One woman said

*“confidence is sexy

Knowing that confidence is that important to women as a trait they need in a guy

**How Important is Physical Appearance to Women?**

Again

*“I realized that people I thought were like a 10 on the sexy scale are actually the dumbest men on earth.”*

Physical appearance ranked slightly above average and the answers really varied from woman to woman. The important thing to note is that confidence is significantly more attractive than physical appearance when it comes to how women define attraction. This is not to negate physical appearance altogether but it shows that while physical appearance may get you in the door

**Dating Tips From Women.**

Finally

*“Please don’t act like you are God’s gift to the world. Girls like confidence but they also want someone approachable and fun. Cocky is NOT attractive. If you talk too much about yourself you’re overcompensating for something and you’re not really that confident in yourself.”*


*“Challenge her. If you act like her doormat

This is why having self confidence is so important. The guy who respects and values himself will stand up for himself. 

**Final Thoughts…**

As we can see, routines and perfect bodies are not the answers to attracting women.

*halfhearted spoiler alert for those of you living under rocks*

This season recently ended and we learned that the winner was Jef

In episode one, not told), Emily something about him - that he's a fun, chill guy who probably has hobbies and adventures outside of his ""entrepreneur"" label. He's not a bad skateboarder either, so it wasn't just some prop. There were someother flashy entrances too, from the guy who danced in with a boombox blaring club music to the rich kid who drops in from a helicopter. Jef's was just unique enough without seeming ridiculous, over-the-top

Next, and brings it back to him as he introduces himself for the first time. Emily comments that he shouldn't have done that, that she wants to try it out later. Just like that, he's gotten himself an ""in"" for spending time with her later, whereas everyone else has to awkwardly interrupt a conversation and pull her away to get their 5 minutes of alone time with her.

Later that first night, complete with some champagne. He stands up and walks to her as she comes in, but very importantly, he has not come hunting for her. His first impression was good enough that she would come to him, and all he had to do was be ready when the opportunity came. He was confident, collected, and patient

*I really like Jef. He made a great first impression. He's super cool

In episode 2, she confides to the cameras:

*Either Jef's playing hard to get or he's just not into me.*

Face-to-face with Jef

*When I came in here tonight I said 'Where the hell is Jef? Like where has he been all day? Why hasn't he come talk to me? ... When I hang out with you I feel very awkward, look at me!'*

At that point, like a returned glance for example, he tells that he honestly has not noticed her checking him out, and that he feels the same insecurity and awkwardness around her. He validates her feeling of vulnerability and builds rapport by matching her sentiment. Yet the underlying message is still clear - this will be an even exchange between them. It won't be him hot in pursuit and her drinking it up. If she wants the reward of his attention, she needs to be prepared to work and give him something as well.

After writing this

*Many have questioned whether Jef’s reticence around Emily was the result of shyness, 'You’re going to have to fight for me too. I don’t want to be the only guy who is pursuing you here. I want you to pursue me.’"" Needless to say, this is not a strategy that comes up much on The Bachelorette, or in life for that matter.*

To be honest, and this is how a winner made his and outshone 24 other very eligible bachelors. As always, the moral of the story is the same principles that have brought you success here before. 

1) Don't be needy.

2) You are the prize.

3) Everything in moderation. Know when to tone it back and be vulnerable.

I was putting my intentions forward without being too blunt and forceful. I was blushing hard, I licked my lips very subtly and smiled at him. It went perfectly, he leaned over and kissed me and before I knew it, I was on his lap making out, and taking his shirt off. The rest is history. 

Thanks for giving me the confidence and needed advice. While flirting looking at a persons eyes then lips actually works as a great indicator you want a kiss.

I have never dated, let alone be a PUA.

I went to a local club (women my age) and I froze. I couldn't even ask the women to dance. The place was packed

The place was packed with brothers and my first learning was this: Black men have no problem approaching a woman

One woman approached me and we danced a couple of songs. She kept grinding on me (seemed like the only dance move she knew) but then as we were talking later (I sat at her table when she was alone and started a conversation) she kept saying how she was just out for fun and dancing

I tried to approach a few women even some unattractive ones and I balked. I felt totally fake and insincere and I think this held me back. I know I only want to get laid or practice a technique. I don't care about the woman I am approaching and I have no intention to. The ""Good Guy"" inside me gets in the way. I feel like I am in Jr. High again when it comes to women. 

BUT

One woman who stopped on her way out told me,  just ask any girl to dance and she is gonna say yes. It is what they came here for.""

RING! They did come here to dance! They did come here to have a guy pick them up! They EXPECT me to be hitting on them

I have analyzed (not over analyzed I think) the night and I can see all my mistakes and even learned a few things. 

Learnings:

Black dudes act fast with the ladies and win so follow suit.

In a club

I have to be in control of the conversation I am having and be aware of my own behavior and set the tone.

It looks so much easier on paper.
