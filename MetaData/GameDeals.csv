**Notes**

Amazon requires that you have a US BILLING ADDRESS to purchase from them.

Reposts of Amazon games on sale will be removed during the sale.

If Amazon price matches a Steam game on sale - which they might - that is okay for posting on its own.

As the sale develops more information will be added each day and each day's posts will include an update of what goes on sale that day so if you check for these threads daily you will not miss anything.

Join others for chat about games on irc.snoonet - [details here](/1blyks)

Reminder: Please do not offer to buy / sell / trade / giveaway / split purchases. There are other subs for that: /r/gamesell, /r/SteamGameSwap. Any comments that do will be removed.

**Notes**

- All the links here carry the [AbleGamer's](http://www.ablegamers.com/) affiliate tag

Amazon requires that you have a US BILLING ADDRESS to purchase from them.

Reposts of Amazon games on sale will be removed during the sale.

If Amazon price matches a Steam game on sale - which they might - that is okay for posting on its own.

As the sale develops more information will be added each day and each day's posts will include an update of what goes on sale that day so if you check for these threads daily you will not miss anything.

Join others for chat about games on irc.snoonet - [details here](/1blyks)

Reminder: Please do not offer to buy / sell / trade / giveaway / split purchases. There are other subs for that: /r/gamesell, /r/SteamGameSwap. Any comments that do will be removed.

**Notes**

 - Amazon requires that you have a **US BILLING ADDRESS** to purchase from them. 

 - Reposts of Amazon games on sale will be removed during the sale.

 - If Amazon price matches a Steam game on sale - which they might - that is okay for posting on its own.

 - As the sale develops more information will be added each day and each day's posts will include an update of what goes on sale that day so if you check for these threads daily you will not miss anything.

Over the last month or so

We have talked about ways that we could deal with this issue, we realize that we can't stop people from exploiting regional restrictions. If people want to purchase regional deals, they should at least be doing it safely. We want people to be aware of the dangers associated with it. Instead of this discussion being relegated to the sometimes unreliable and misinformed comment section, we want to directly address it and hopefully provide accurate information and a place to ask questions. 

While we can offer some insight into what we've seen and other users can offer their experiences, shouldn't be taken on any kind of authority. The only people that will be able to tell you about their policy on regional restrictions are the retailers and services. One of the more extreme policies is from the most used digital distribution service, Steam:

&gt;*You agree that you will not use IP proxying or other methods to disguise the place of your residence, or for any other purpose. If you do this, we may terminate your access to your Account.*

Steam's policy

Issues regarding account termination for exploiting regional restrictions are not the most common issue that we hear about. By far, a chargeback is a serious action that can lead to account termination or additional fees if your card issuer finds in favor of the merchant. A chargeback is not a secret weapon against merchants and should not be used lightly.  

The most critical issue is one of information safety. The safety of your information(credit card, you are the product. Put simply, what happens between you, a VPN/proxy, and an endpoint (such as Steam, PayPal, another region's website

Our top concern is the safety of the users of /r/GameDeals. We want you to be aware of the dangers associated with using VPNs and proxies.


Thanks

-Adam(and the other /r/GameDeals mods)


**TL;DR**

* Don't use a VPN to activate games on your account!
* Consider the possible dangers when buying from another region.
* Don't put your credit card information,,False,self,t5_2qwx3,False,,True

For the 75% off discount, particularly those that don't have enough reviews to get an official Metascore. So here's a second sweep through the list (almost 70 more games). My new criteria:

* 75% off
* Permit games with fewer than 4 critic reviews (no official Metascore)
* User Score is 75 or higher **or** critic scores are 75 or higher (scores are marked bold when **both** are 70 or higher)
* Not already mentioned in previous Deepest Discount post

There's this secondary subreddit that we've been using for about ten months now. It's for everything that doesn't fit into /r/GameDeals. It's called /r/GameDealsMeta, and, most importantly, information about past deals. Yes, this includes PSAs, like [Tony's recent post about Divinity II: Dragon Knight Saga being upgraded to Director's Cut](http://www.reddit.com/r/GameDealsMeta/comments/1bzyws/psa_if_you_bought_divinity_ii_dragon_knight_saga/), or numerous postings about past bundles that have added Steam codes. Seriously, because that's where all the PSAs have been going.

You'll also notice some cool changes around the edges of /r/GameDeals. First, because many people were mentioning that they hadn't seen it. That's crazy, considering it's on *every* GameDeals page. We've also updated it with a link to a [multi-reddit of GameDeals/new and GameDealsMeta/new.](http://se.reddit.com/r/GameDeals/search?q=subreddit%3AGameDeals+OR+subreddit%3AGameDealsMeta&amp;sort=new&amp;t=all) Yes, it's not the normal method for multi-reddits, but this one allows us to still show our fancy CSS.

I've never been a big fan of how Steam categorizes their games really broadly. This is especially difficult when as far as I know

I decided to make a list of all the games Steam has on sale currently in the Winter Sale to help people find games more specific to a particular genre they might be interested in and help draw attention to some unknown/underrated games. The emphasis of the list was on indie games and lesser known or forgotten titles. 

Keep in mind, some with additional videos online. Some will be wrong and suggestions, whether it be for an additional categories or to indicate a game should be moved to a more fitting category would really help.

Metacritic scores were omitted since 1. not all games have them. 2. many of them are done when a game is first released and usually considers bugs/glitches present in the game that may have been fixed later. 3. they are subjective to an extent.

The rest of the list will be posted in the comments. If the game is part of a collection in the same series

The list will be continue to be updated so suggestions are again

EDIT: Forgot to mention that the prices listed are the lowest prices the game has been sold for (Daily/Flash deals).

A little over a year and a half ago we had just hit 10, we know that there are always things that we can work to improve. But these temporary hiccups only help punctuate the fantastic couple of years that we've had. /r/GameDeals has turned into a great resource for saving money, getting opinions on games and deals, interacting with the reps, and passively helping our charity partners with your purchases. We're proud of the community and we know that it couldn't be where it is today without you. Everybody contributes in their own way. Be it through comments, deal submissions, or even just voting. Thank you.

With an eye on the future

Thank you

1339805167.0,v49wg,Let's Get Ready For The Steam Summer Sale 2012!,bryanhbell,501,113,206,"Steam's annual summer sales in 2011 and 2010 both started on the last Thursday in June

**EDIT: I was wrong. The sale did not begin on this date. See [FAQs About Steam's Big Sales](//www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/vnrr5) for further information.**

Reddit has been a great place to get information on these sales, [squidthesid](//www.reddit.com/user/squidthesid), [CommentStatistics](//www.reddit.com/user/CommentStatistics) and others. Subreddits like /r/gaming and /r/games have played host to these redditors' daily posts, while subreddits such as /r/steamdeals and /r/GameDeals have carried the torch between the big sales. Thanks to you all! You make these sales so much fun!

*Sadly

**But here's where I need help from all of you.**

I'd like your input on the ways we could improve the daily sales posts. Below is a template for my daily sale posts. It is based on previous sale posts by ltx and Remmib (such as [this](//www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/nv4os/steam_holiday_sale_2011_day_11/) and [this](//www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/nv4ok/steam_holiday_sale_day_11_useful/)).

What should be added? Changed? Removed? I'm particularly interested in those pieces of information that are most helpful to redditors when deciding whether or not to buy a game.

Keep in mind that there is a 10, assembling the information for these posts is time-consuming, so any resources (such as [this](//steamdrm.flibitijibibo.com/index.php?page=DRM_Lists/The_Big_DRM_List) and [this](//www.steamprices.com/)) you can provide for finding information is most appreciated.

The GameDeals subreddit has been growing a lot lately. We have almost 50, I know), we (the moderators) have been keeping things very strict with what is allowed here. To remind you, here are the rules. (These are not new rules, they have been here for a while.)

**The following are not allowed:**

* Blogspam that isn't about an offline sale. (There's really no reason to post a link to a blog when posting a link directly to the sale saves everyone's time.)

* Redirection links or URL shorteners. (There's no reason to use these on reddit ever.)

* Affiliate tags on links, so we allow those. Their links will be green.)

* Unauthorized CD key resellers. (They might be cheap

* Anything that isn't information about a sale (This includes giveaways, and other super-limited things. We have nearly 50,000 subscribers. If there's only one or two copies of the game, they'll be gone in seconds, and the post will still be there, cluttering up the page. My general rule is it must be available to at least 1-2% of subscribers. If you're giving away something, try /r/PlayItForward, or /r/GiftofGames. Also, /r/TrueGaming if you have something in-depth

**Edit for clarification**: Coupon codes that are redeemable by a large number of people are fine

About unauthorized resellers:

""Unauthorized resellers"" is the term the GameDeals mods have been using when we're talking about sites that don't get their copies of games from the game's publisher. They get codes from some other source, and hand those lists to distributors, asking them to remove those copies of the game. Valve has no easy way of removing a single game from a Steam account, and they have been known to lock/ban entire accounts because some not-so-legally-obtained keys were redeemed.

We don't want that to happen to unsuspecting people just because they wanted to save a few bucks. So we banned unauthorized resellers from GameDeals.

We can't actually tell which sites have stolen keys, sales will bring the end price down a bit, but the base price will still be sixty bucks. If I open a site and see that their base price for a $60 game is $28, and a sale lowers it even further, I'm highly skeptical.

Another method I use: If you look in the game features section (where the site normally tells you if it's a Steam game, a lot of unauthorized resellers will boast that they will send you a *scanned code* via email. Dead giveaway. If you were a games publisher, and you wanted to give Steam codes for your game to a digital-only site so they could sell them, would you print up individual cards with scratch-off/peel-off codes, then ship them off just to have them be scanned in at their end? Fuck no, those cards cost money to make! You'd just send them an email (or some other digital document) with codes in it.

1364918672.0,1bisig,Promoted Links: What they mean for the subreddit and what we can do about them.,RedditCommentAccount,382,73,88,"Hey

Over the past month, but are not limited to, receiving stolen keys and receiving regional keys that must be activated by VPN. The most recent [example of this]( http://unknownworlds.com/blog/beware-shady-key-resellers-and-discount-steam-keys/) happened with a popular game, ""Natural Selection 2."" Over a thousand keys were fraudulently purchased from them, and sold at a discount. All of these keys were disabled by the developer. In-turn, all accounts that had one of those stolen keys associated with it had the game removed from the library without warning.* **The admins agreed with our decision to not allow these shady CD-key reseller sites and I think they will be supportive in getting rid of future promoted links that try to advertise for CD-key resellers.**

Unfortunately, any promoted link that doesn't specifically endanger the users of the subreddit will be permitted to remain. This is not a reason to be angry at the admins. This is the price that we pay for using their platform. A price that I think is reasonable and am certainly willing to pay. **We absolutely don't have a problem with advertisements.** We welcome more companies to advertise within the subreddit. If we can find a way to benefit a company and the users of this subreddit, that would be fantastic. We even have an promoted link that is doing it right: **BUNDLESTARS**. Where the problem arises is when these advertisements are affiliate in nature. Affiliates create nothing. They leech. They exploit. And they use this subreddit and its users as a means of profit. I would like to clarify that **we are unable to do anything about the promoted links.** They are completely outside of our control. We cannot hide them. We do not get to choose which ones show up. **The promoted links will have no effect on the rules of regular links and comments.** 

The currently promoted link is an unnamed deal aggregator. They do not appear to aggregate any of the CD-key resellers, GamersGate, Gamestop, GetGamesGo, GOG, GreenManGaming, Steam, with the exception of Steam and GetGamesGo.** I would hazard a guess that this is only the case because neither of those stores have an affiliate partnership program in place. Gamefly, week

The economics of the promoted link work fairly well in favor for the promoter. Barring competition amongst promoted links, so to speak. If there was only a single link being promoted on /r/GameDeals, the coverage for that link would be 24 hours a day for as long as the promoter is willing to pay. Since there are currently two links being promoted, the coverage for each link it slightly diminished. If another advertiser decides to complete with that link, their coverage is diminished proportionally to the amount each of them pay. Once the promoter gains access to the user base through a promoted link, the process of monetizing those users is fairly simple. As was briefly touched on above, most affiliate marketers' goal is not to sell you on a specific product, competition and the chance of having their affiliate cookie overwritten is minimal. **Because /r/GameDeals is a relatively closed ecosystem and in conjunction with the low cost of entry and our quickly growing subscriber base

To give you an example of why advertising on the subreddit is so attractive, Amazon will pay out a 10% rate on digital download games with their Affiliate Partnership Program. Taking a $10.00 game that is on sale for $2.50, which many of you would agree is not an uncommon experience; an affiliate marketer would get $0.25. It would take only 80 purchases with their affiliate information to make back the investment cost of $20.00 on a promoted link. 80 purchases on a $2.50 game isn't something a community of nearly 90,000 users would struggle with.

For nearly two years, and most recently, Able Gamers. When clicking on, and purchasing from links with one of these three tags attached, they make money. **Working with charities to ensure that affiliate money goes where it is needed has been a proud tradition on /r/GameDeals. We are willing to work with charities to set up additional amazon/non-amazon affiliates that will benefit them.** 

The objective of our subreddit has been

Thank you

1341305994.0,vyz68,[WARNING] Do not buy from Amazon.com (If you aren't from the USA),jeveuxdormir,524,246,290,"Greetings

I bought many games and books from Amazon.com

I tried to talk with the support and provided my personal billing informations but they told me to wait for an email from the support specialist.

Today I got an email which basically says that they have closed my account and my SO account also and we can do nothing about it.

We can't access the games and books that we have bought anymore

Please be aware of this happening to you if you aren't from the USA and bought from them anyway.

I wish you a better day then mine.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

**EDIT6** I got my account back
I wish you all a good day.

**EDIT5** Some people find the title misleading, please be my guest.


**EDIT4** I've just contacted amazon.com support by chat and this time around they told me to wait 24h for an answer from an account specialist. (yesterday it was the support specialist that sent me the second email).


**EDIT3** I contacted my bank and apparently


**EDIT2** It seems that I'm not the only one

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

**EDIT 1**

I'll put some answers here and hopefully it'll be useful.

Q:**Did they give any reasons at all?**

Yes

* I got this first email ""Unfortunately

I provided my personal informations to the support with my current address and billing informations.

* Then I got the second email ""This message is to inform you that we have closed your Amazon.com account. We have taken this action because we found this account to be related to previously closed account. In addition

I believe this email is related to the fact that my SO lives with me, it shouldn't be an issue anywhere.

Q:**Did you've any problem with you credit card before? What kind of credit card do you use?**

No

Q:**Did you use a real US address (restaurants

I always used my real address on the other website but I did made up an address on amazon.com for buying the games.
I know many people used hotels or restaurants address

Q:**Did you purchase anything recently? I might be in trouble

Yes

Q:**Why do you assume it is related to the fake address?**

The only evidence for me that they have closed my account because of the fake address is this ""Unfortunately

Q:**Did you get your steam banned and games removed?**

Why would they ban my steam account? I bought all my games legally and the one on amazon are region free. Steam only ban you if you cheat in game or use VPN to buy games from their shop. The worst they can do is remove your game
We've paid for ours games and they are region free

Q:**What are you going to do now?**

I'm going to call my bank and see if there is some problems with amazon.com

Q:**Why are you complaining? it was your fault** 

Yes it is my fault, and I hope for you all that is a single accident and that your accounts are safe, I'll try to see if it is indeed a related to my bank or not. ",,True,nsfw,t5_2qwx3,,http://www.reddit.com/r/GameDeals/comments/vyz68/warning_do_not_buy_from_amazoncom_if_you_arent/

Hey

Congratulations on reaching 50

**The new feature:**

Flair-based filtering: It has been a long time coming. The most requested feature is the ability to sort, given the tools at our disposal, we believe flair-based filtering is the best option. If this option doesn't work out, we can consider creating more individual, specialized subreddits.

* http://co.reddit.com/r/gamedeals : The first is the ability to sort by deals marked with with the Console flair. This will be the umbrella grouping for all non-PC games.

* http://ww.reddit.com/r/gamedeals : The next is the ability to sort deals marked with the Rest of World flair. This will be the umbrella grouping for all non-US deals. It is not required we use this exact subdomain or flair descriptor. We considered using the EU subdomain

* http://ph.reddit.com/r/gamedeals : The last is the ability to sort deals marked with the Physical flair. This will contain all games that are not digital.

At this time

[Reddit Enhancement Suite](http://redditenhancementsuite.com) with ""never-ending reddit"" is recommended for use with this feature. As a technical explanation

Note: You may see empty pages when you go to the filter links. Once flairs start to be applied

**Community Feedback:**

1. How do you feel about reposts? I consider there to be two primary types of reposts:
 * Reminder posts: Any post that serves the purpose of reposting a deal on purpose to bring it to the communities attention again.
 * Incidental reposts: The reposts that happen when multiple people all submit the daily deal and none of them are deleted by the submitter.
 
 Right now

2. How do you feel about Deal Indexing Sites? We've recently been receiving a fair amount of queries into ""Deal Indexing Sites"". An example of one of these sites would be Cheapshark. A user had previously submitted a roundup of these sites and we removed it because some of the sites contained links to affiliates. We understand that a list of these types of sites could be useful to the community

Please feel free to submit submit feedback or your own questions.

Thanks

-Adam

**Notes**

Amazon requires that you have a US BILLING ADDRESS to purchase from them.

Reposts of Amazon games on sale will be removed during the sale.

If Amazon price matches a Steam game on sale - which they might - that is okay for posting on its own.

As the sale develops more information will be added each day and each day's posts will include an update of what goes on sale that day so if you check for these threads daily you will not miss anything.

You might have woken up to find your order has been canceled. Tony

&gt;Hey guys, I copy/pasted a previous request for a mass mail, in this previous request the words ""also please cancel all of the attached orders"" (we had an issue with a product previously that we had to cancel/refund orders on because the product never shipped). So, when sending the email out, letting customers know there was no pre-load, we also cancelled all the orders. Again, this was totally my bad. Cheers

Seems to me the best way to get results is to ring 8664390310 or get them to ring you

Any non Americans worried about them throwing a fit over you not being american, and he applied the code for me with no questions. I even gave him my English billing address. Phoning 8664390310 with US selected through Skype was free also.

As usual if you have any suggestions for these threads please

Pricing errors occur because the prices for Steam games fluctuate a lot within the first 10-20 minutes of going on daily/flash/community choice sale

Since there seems to be some confusion on how I list franchise packs I will explain. If there is a franchise pack, CIS, RU, EU, UK, AUS). If there is no franchise pack, or if the franchise pack is region specific (like GTA's from yesterday) I will just list the price of the game in the image shown on Steam and link to the franchise page,,1356936849.0,t3_15oi07

As usual if you have any suggestions for these threads please

Pricing errors occur because the prices for Steam games fluctuate a lot within the first 10-20 minutes of going on daily/flash/community choice sale

Since there seems to be some confusion on how I list franchise packs I will explain. If there is a franchise pack, CIS, RU, EU, UK, AUS). If there is no franchise pack, or if the franchise pack is region specific (like GTA's from yesterday) I will just list the price of the game in the image shown on Steam and link to the franchise page,,1356987367.0,t3_15qdqt

As I'm sure many of you have noticed, and reminders to check your email/account/etc. While we understand that some of the subscribers of the subreddit don't mind these types of submissions, we feel that these submissions stray outside of the focus/scope of the subreddit. Most of the users of the subreddit subscribe for deals on games and as the subreddit increases in size, the amount of clutter will likely increase if no action is taken to prevent it. Whereas subreddits like /r/games, /r/gaming, and /r/truegaming are all relatively general subreddits, I consider /r/gamedeals to be a more focused subreddit. Going forward, it is easier for someone to subscribe to another subreddit than it is to hide submissions that they aren't interested in.

-Adam

Note: This isn't a slight against anyone. The issue just came to a head today and we felt that we should address it before people started wondering why some posts were removed.

As /r/gamedeals grows more popular, and users submitting deals from questionable sites. We consider the safety of the people who use this subreddit to be our number one priority, but we also realize that in trying to protect the users of the subreddit, we may be excluding good deals from legitimate retailers. Unfortunately, the only way to confirm the legitimacy of some of these retailers is to contact the publishers and hope for a response. Thus far, we've been unable to get a response from publishers. We have been in contact with a few retailers and they have been able to slightly quell our apprehension by revealing what appear to be legitimate distribution channels that, in turn, we've removed these sites because couldn't verify their legitimacy and we wanted to try to err on the side of caution for the protection of the the users on /r/gamedeals. We'd still like to be cautious, they have been able to prove themselves. I believe that we need to allow other retailers this opportunity.

The policy on CD key resellers will remain unchanged. If we have reason to believe that keys were acquired illegitimately, deals from that site will be removed. If the community overwhelmingly determines that a site it unsafe, deals from that site will be removed. The idea is to allow upvotes, downvotes, and comments to determine the fate of a deal as much as possible without compromising the safety of the people on /r/gamedeals. Currently, I believe the presence of a deal on the subreddit signifies to most users that we have approved the deal or that the deal is safe. This is not what we intended. Going forward, we will, be unable to guarantee the safety of any accounts you attach questionable keys to. We ask that you to carry a little skepticism for the unknown names

We'd like to have this policy change run on a trial basis. We will revisit this topic in about a week and decide if it is the best course of action for the subreddit. As always, then great, let us know below. We take your comments seriously and it's your say above all else that matters to us. Continue to use the report button if you question the legitimacy of a site, and please leave a comment or contact the mods (via ""message the moderators"" in the sidebar) so we know why the thread was reported.

**A note to independent retailers:**

While we have generally been accepting of self-promotion, up to the banning of your site.

Will you be our valentine?

+-+-+-+-+-+- **Information** +-+-+-+-+-+-

**How can I get these credits?**

They were only available when purchasing a game late last year at Amazon.com

**Can I get more credits?**

No.

**Do credits stack?**

No.

**Can I trade / swap to get more credits?**

No. They are attached to your account and untradeable.

**How do I know how many credits I have?**

1 - Search your email for this complete phrase and count the emails: It is our pleasure to let you know that you have earned a $5 credit toward the purchase of select game downloads

2 - **Try** to buy a game. Look to see at the Checkout if any Promo credit has been applied. (Be careful not to buy a game accidentally of course)

(If someone says to use the Amazon widget - it's useless for this)

**Will more games be added to this selection?**

Yes and as soon as dates/deals are known they will be posted.

**Will prices drop even further?**

No idea

**Important!**

**DRM**

Some games are standalone, some are Ubisoft. Read the game page fully before buying if it matters to you. If you buy the wrong one contact Amazon Customer Services and politely explain.

So you get to see everything I have added a comment to this post - there is just too much for a single post otherwise.

**IMPORTANT**: Some sales

Note: Where the sale says 'to December 22' this could mean until the end of the 21st OR the end of the 22nd. So don't wait until the last day.

1332016491.0,r16uj,Proposal: Ongoing deals in the sidebar.,RedditCommentAccount,201,30,33,"Hey

We've recently had some requests to highlight ongoing/long-term deals in one way or another. Unfortunately, is either using the note: at the top or the sidebar on the...side. I think that this sort of thing would likely work better in the sidebar because there isn't much space to do anything at the top.

I think we should have some restrictions on which deals will be posted in the sidebar because the list could very quickly get out of hand. These are some ideas:

* Have a limit on the minimum number of days a deal would need to run to be put in the sidebar. Most daily deals and mid-week-end deals won't fall off of the front page before the deal ends. **How many days should a deal need to run to be on the list?**
* User submitted or moderator curated? If the list was curated by the moderators

I can't think of anything else that I need to add. If you have any questions/ideas/opinions/suggestions/etc. feel free to respond with them.

**Sound good to everyone?**

But I will be copying and pasting with some minor edits in bold:

This promotion is only available in Australia. Alternatively

You can get Prince of Persia® The Forgotten Sands™, Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter 2, From Dust and Beyond Good &amp; Evil.

To do this

None of these titles are Steam redeemable

1. Login to your Facebook account (Needs to be verified) @ www.facebook.com **Does not need to be listed as from Australia in your location**

2. Then go [here](http://www.facebook.com/lynx/app_544424275584664?ref=ts)

3. Fill in all the boxes, I used the 10 digit format** When you get to the boxes with the last 4 digits of the first product, pick two from this list here:

• Lynx 2012 - 5550

• Lynx Africa - 2606

• Lynx Anarchy - 5727

• Lynx Anti-Hangover - 0083

• Lynx Click - 4144

• Lynx Cool Summer - 7298

• Lynx Dark Temptation - 4327

• Lynx Excite - 5354

• Lynx Fever - 0090

• Lynx Instinct - 7304

• Lynx Legend - 2872

• Lynx Shock - 0106

• Lynx Twist - 1868

• Lynx Voodoo - 1948

4. Enter any 6 digit number in the “Receipt Number” box. Make it up

5. Check the box “I agree to the terms and conditions”

6. Check your email for a code. It should say something like “Your code is: …….”.

7. Now go to shop.ubi.com/lynx2

**Not from Australia and don't want to use a proxy? Then take this tip from &gt;KJH&lt; on Steam**

**"" Dec 10
for those not living in Australia and want this deal

8. Click add to cart on one of these games
- Assassin's Creed Brotherhood
- Prince of Persia The Forgotten Sands
- NCIS**&lt;--Warning
- Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter 2
- From Dust
- Beyond Good and Evil

9. Then

10. If you only want one of these games

11. If you want more than 1 of those games, I don't even think this is a trick. It says ""Buy 2 Lynx Cans = 3 Free games"". I just happened to pick out 3 games.**

12. Do the same with second product you selected

13. Once your done selecting all your games, I grabbed some information from fakenamegenerator that seemed Australian, but I don't think this is necessary. After pressing submit order, it sent me back to my own country's page supposedly, but within 30 minutes, I got my codes. Actually it tried to send me back to my country's page several times in the ordering process but it all appears to have worked out**

Enjoy! 

------

Additional non bolded tips from me because I have a feeling too much bold is annoying. If you're new to uplay like me, there will be download links in those emails. You download the games and keep uplay running, eventually there will be some point in the installation process that asks for the key, then it'll add it to uplay. (You may have to enter them in the game AND uplay, I'm not sure if this is necessary, but that's what I did. You should be able to run the game from the Windows ""Games"" folder at first). Also because of this, don't try to trade the codes. 

Note: From Dust may also not work without restarting your computer after an update

If any of this is against the rules, I am not sure if they'll handle it like Origin did if this blows up.

**UPDATE** 11:25 PM US Central: If you entered an alternate email as a ""friend"", or you can really give it to a friend who doesn't use Facebook. Special thanks to [distinctvagueness](http://www.reddit.com/r/GameDeals/comments/14t9g6/ubisoft_free_ac_brotherhood_from_dust_beyond_good/c7gcqen)

**Notes**

Amazon requires that you have a US BILLING ADDRESS to purchase from them.

Reposts of Amazon games on sale will be removed during the sale.

If Amazon price matches a Steam game on sale - which they might - that is okay for posting on its own.

As the sale develops more information will be added each day and each day's posts will include an update of what goes on sale that day so if you check for these threads daily you will not miss anything.

Amazon requires that you have a US BILLING ADDRESS to purchase from them.

Reposts of Amazon games on sale will be removed during the sale.

If Amazon price matches a Steam game on sale - which they might - that is okay for posting on its own.

As the sale develops more information will be added each day and each day's posts will include an update of what goes on sale that day so if you check for these threads daily you will not miss anything.

**Share Your Favorites!**

There are over 1000 games on sale. That's a lot to sift through. If there's a game on sale that you recommend (let's say, and link to the game (make sure that you remove unauthorized affiliate tags, or AutoModerator will eat your post). I'll sift through some of the best and add them to the Community Picks list below. Don't be offended if your game doesn't make the list. There's only so much room in this post. Please remember to keep things friendly. If you disagree with a comment, explain in detail why, and what you'd recommend instead (""It sucks!"" is not a valid reason. ""I feel that x in this game is lacking because it..."" is great!). Comments that are intentionally rude or those that add nothing positive to the discussion will be removed without warning.

tl;dr: Find a game (Under $10) that you like. Write a bit about it. Post!
