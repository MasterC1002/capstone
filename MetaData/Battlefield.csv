* Attack chopper they took down looked to be a Chinese [Z-10](http://www.military-today.com/helicopters/z10.htm) confirming my above point.

* N S E W arrows ON THE MINI MAP... not some obscure bar that most people don't look at.

* After the building collapse

* The support pillar that they took down to bring down the road

* **In the video it was indeed a RECON that C4'd the tank**

* Commanders can see which squad has what classes. (I didn't play BF2 so I don't know if they could do that before or not)

* Dual-sights is not limited to Irons and one zoomed

* Pressing the melee button while BEING knifed will create a counter-knife attack.

loner_ru pointed out a few things.

* Squad perks seem to be unlocked via some form of squad XP

* Commanders get certain capabilities depending on what flags are controlled (Evident at 4:20 of the youtube video on the top left)

For all of those who are new to the franchise (BC2 or newer)

Historically

What does this mean to the new converts

Simple:

DICE has always had one or two classes that excelled at Infantry Warfare / Spearhead operations. These classes were at the top of the infantry-combat food-chain. No other class got near their lethality against other soldiers with guns

Then DICE would have a class that had very high infantry lethality, high power cover fire, as well as supplies, to the front line. Additionally, some of these classes traded range for explosive power, so that they could handle vehicles that would otherwise decimate the Spearhead.

Behind these classes were the purely support classes, such as vehicle maintenance and target designation.

In Battlefield 2

Spearhead:
Spec-ops.
Assault.
Medic.

Defensive/Cover:
Support
Anti Tank

Support:
Sniper.
Engineer.

But this is not limited to Battlefield 2

There were very few scenarios where a Support class or Anti-Tank class could survive an attack on an enemy position that had defenders. That role was exclusive to Assault, at longer ranges, or from a defensive position against many targets, the Spearhead classes began to quickly lose their effectiveness. They were, for the most part, useless against vehicles, and ran out of ammunition too quickly to survive against a large wave of enemies. 

Players were forced to choose a class based on the role they wished to play, or had other tactical reasons to spawn it. The combat range limitations, as well as the tools provided were simply not intended to survive in a massive firefight.

Battlefield 3 owes much of its monotony not to the Assault class, their interchangeability. Every firefight essentially plays out the same way since at any given time over 75% of players are combat effective at medium ranges. That, and the maps are too small for the increased mobility. Simply put, unlike all previous Battlefield titles, where spawning a specific kit was a decision, not an impulse or habit. The games made you think, you had to be creative

Balancing classes to the point where they are all essentially the same just yields a game that everyone has already player. It replaces real variety with apparent variety, but really the same experience all around. 1200 hours of Battlefield 2 was easy *for a casual*. 400 hours of BF3 feels like work.

In short:

If you want inter-class balance

If you want a deep multiplayer experience with lots of variety

1370109240.0,1fh21a,[BF4] The 3 Things I Want MOST in the Next Battlefield Games,by_a_pyre_light,77,15,49,"1) **More/varied environments**- I ***REALLY*** want some good jungle environments ala Bad Company 2

2) **A full Day/Night Cycle like JO:TR had**. I remember how amazing that was because it really impacted the gameplay. 
Read this description from the *Gamespot* review:

&gt; Meanwhile, so you have to slow down and take your time. We've also seen instances of players flying *strafing runs in the helicopter with the setting sun at their backs*; anybody looking up to locate where the fire is coming from gets *blinded by the sun* *(I'm sure we can relate to this in BF3, huh?)*. At night, there's usually enough moonlight to see without night-vision goggles most of the time, but it can still *get fairly dark, necessitating the use of the goggles, which transform the darkness into an eerie green*. It's cool to view combat at night


See how badass these changes were? That's what I'd like to see. Crysis 1's multiplayer had day/night cycles too and they were great at changing the feel of the maps. 

3) **Inclement weather that actually impacts gameplay!** Snow should be harder to walk on, which makes reflexes slower and aiming a little more prone to drifting as your muscles struggle to operate in the cold. They did a bit of this in the single player campaign of Bad Company. Having some sort of environmental, timed element ala Metro, where you can't be outside for too long or your breathing becomes labored, and your goggles fog, and you need to get inside to warmth would be cool. 
Same for the driving, your character could wipe the goggles with a sleeve. 

If they don't do this, which, IMO, is missing a lot of immersive gameplay opportunities. ",Battlefield 4,False,self,False,t3_1fh21a

 - EAUK - This is a special tag for the Mordor guys to represent their fallen love

We also have custom submission buttons that allows you to tag posts with the respective games ( like [BF4]

This leads me to what will be coming soon!

We're going to be adding filters so you can choose what content you want within the subreddit. Only want Battlefield 4 content? You got it. Only want Battlefield 1942 related content? Done! This will be as easy as clicking a sidebar link to take you to the necessary prefix. It will filter the subreddit so that ONLY content from a specific game will be visible.

We're going to add a dropdown menu with content like links to other communities, specific game guides, and much much more. Skitrel is liasing with the competitive community to see what the subreddit can do to support the (hopeful) growth of competitive battlefield.

To this end I think the following would be welcome changes to make:

* Can be levelled up and equipped in the same way as attack vehicles.  The first two equipment slots should have equipment similar to other aircraft: Stealth, ECM, Air Radar, Proximity Scan, etc.

* Third equipment slot should allow you to specialize your transport helicopter's role.  Some examples:

  * Medivac - Heals passengers

  * Resupply - Resupplies passengers and nearby soldiers

  * Gunship - Gatling guns (should be disabled by default)

  * Transport - Additional passenger spaces

  * Recon - MAV-like proximity scan

* Points awarded for:

  * Dropping passengers off at an objective.

  * Picking up wounded passengers.

  * Healing/re-supplying/passenger kill assists/spot assists depending on specialization.

* Associated ribbons, and dog-tags.

* Ability for soldiers

* Ability for passengers to request

* Optional voice communication between passengers and pilot (this would be great in all vehicles actually)

* Optional direct voice communication with the solider that has requested a pickup when you're near to that location.

Accessibility refers to the ability for inexperienced players to use jets.  If you are a jet noob and you try to fly in most public servers

My problems with ejecting lie in denying the other pilot a kill, I think it should change.  Ejecting should work as is when the jet is in good condition although I would like an ejection animation; however, if the jet is disabled, I would like to see a % chance that the ejection seat is broken.  Maybe something like 40%.

The other aspects of jets in BF3 I like so far but there are still some things I would like to see implemented for them in BF4.  I really want the thunderbolt and frogfoot on conquest maps with flankers and super hornets.  I know there would need to be balance issues but maybe 1 flanker/hornet and 2 frogfoots/thunderbolts since jets main focus should be ground especially on rush/  I know that is extremely open ended and full of wholes but I would love to see it implemented.

This would do a few things:  

- Slow down the rate at which revives can occur
- Remove the ability to quickly move the camera around while reviving focusing on a need for a player need to scan the area first - it would be nice to have a little bit of camera movement while in the animation
- Remove the ability to quickly cancel the revive
- Create a really cool revive animation
- Greatly reduce the amount of 'revive knifing' 

It seems like this would almost stop rambo revives and make medics focus on eliminating enemies before reviving.  This could increase the amount of squad wipes and allow for greater ability to move up on a map.  It would also be nice to see the points for being spawned on increase to reward players for staying alive to give their squad a place to spawn closer to the combat areas.

DICE are smart

TDM is great for working on gun play and trying new weapons but for those of us who like a more open ended battlefield with strategy and command, if not BF then another title.

So what would it look like? 

Well, RUSH, Conquest etc. Let's just call it 'Headquarters'.

It would start off similar to the way conquest/conquest large does. Both teams have a deployment and a set amount of vehicles in the beginning. There's flags

Only all your progress from your ranking up in other games? All your unlocks? Gone. Each faction has their base weapons so you have a shallow pool to chose from in your loadout

It will be the role of the commander to bring these elements to his team during the course of the round. 

The function of the flags will be to gather resources/credit as well as bleed enemy tickets (to set a match timer) Games could be won by enemy teams tickets reaching zero or by blasting the doors of the underground HQ/air craft carrier (like rush or Titan) and taking out the commander sat by the command console.

The flag points will generate a stream of credit to the commander's funds, boats, bikes, helicopters, defensive walls, tanks, AA positions
 
Squad leaders are able to make requests to the commander in what weapons/vehicles/unlocks are wanted by his squad. Anything the commander unlocks will be available for all players on the team and will remain so until the game is over. This included weapons/attachments.

There will be VOIP. The commander can communicate with anyone, talk to the entire team, talk to all squad leaders, talk to individuals etc 

So instead of the game having a set list of vehicle spawns at certain locations - the commander deploys vehicles by purchasing them with credit. This just opens the game right up in my opinion

In order to spawn vehicles the appropriate building would have to be constructed. E.g a dockyard for spawning boats/jet ski's

How far would you like to see BF go in the RTS direction in a new game-mode? Do you like the idea of the commander purchasing vehicles but not the idea of constructing buildings first? Would you like a game-mode in which both teams start off with the bare-essentials and over the course of the round,,False,self,t5_2rdgw,False,other,True

In the original Planetside these were a huge part of increased immersion

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rtik1UDpRWA

I know the animations seem like a really small detail, in a first person game everything ought to occur via the first person. If I'm getting into a tank I should clamber on top and jump in through the hatch, ending with the looking at the little display inside. If I'm switching between seats in a jeep my character should climb out of his seat and into the gunner position.

In addition to this, little wobbles of the camera based on bumps in the road, leaning left/right indicating gforces, zooming in and out to denote acceleration and speed. I really feel like it's some sort of benchmark for what first person games should be aiming to achieve.

Anyway

Thoughts?

EDIT: [This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-X0UlZVUMk) also shows off quite a lot of the animations. It also includes one other thing I really love, these giant incredible heavy metal monstrosities coming to sudden stops.

I've always wanted to have the explosions affect your character in multiplayer to add another aspect of immersion. If an RPG impacts near you, you'd take damage accordingly. When a grenade goes off under your feet, you'll be sent in another direction, dying on your way back to earth.

I'm not sure how much they used to cost

When you buy a game

You have a choice to buy or not buy the things DICE would like to offer you. Everyone in the world would rather everything was free, it's just business.

There's also the weathered argument of video games being the cheapest form of modern entertainment there is. 

I've spent £64 ($101 USD) on Battlefield 3 and premium, so to illustrate with a really conservative example:

If I bought it all **today**, going bowling, going out to a bar for a drink or just about anything I can currently think of.

1372650867.0,1hem88,Battlefield should learn many things from Red Orchestra 2,SovietPootis,41,18,26,"Long post

So, and Dice should take a lesson from it. Now I am not saying Dice should copy-paste every single thing from this game and put it into Battlefield, but there are many details that should be changed in my opinion.

For those who do not know, organs, large veins.) It has many features which are included in Battlefield such as squads, commander, similar game-mode, 32vs32 fights, tickets. Many people say that it's a child of Arma and Battlefield - that is surprisingly accurate.

One of the things that Red Orchestra 2 does great is the Commander mode. [Here's a picture of Commander mode.](http://i.imgur.com/pU0YefD.jpg) 

Aerial recon is like a scan in BF2

Mortars, fast cooldown time and you have many mortar strikes. Artillery is more effective, but it takes longer time to deploy, less accurate and slower cooldown time. Also you have only few artillery barrages. Rocket Volley is a one-time use, massive strike on a large area. You will be extremely lucky if you manage to survive that.

Force Respawn is good if you need quickly men to the frontlines

But the most important part of this system is that **squad leaders must mark strike spots.** This is done with binoculars. Just aim your target and mark it. There cannot be done any strikes if artillery marks haven't been marked. This forces players to do teamwork. Yes

How can this be implemented to Battlefield 4? Well, Tomahawks aren't guided with Soflam IRL, but in BF other details aren't so accurate either: RPG-7 guided with a dart.. haha. Also, there are other laser-guided strikes IRL that should be implemented in the game.

These changes would make the commander powers less spammable, expect maybe for AC-130. But I am not sure either if AC-130 was a good idea at all.


One thing I also like about Red Orchestra 2 is that there are class limits. Most of the people get a bolt-action rifle with iron sights as a primary. It's very effective weapon if you learn to use it

You have other classes such as assault which have SMGs, flame-throwers, engineers, squad leaders, snipers, elite rifleman (semi-auto rifle) and a commander. There are usually only 2-4 available slots per role. Also, not all roles are not available on each map

Squad leader is a special role. He is a mobile spawn point for his squad

Now how these could be implemented to Battlefield 4? Restricting classes might be too much, they have been re-balanced all the time in BF3. Before the patch they were weak as hell, but after that they were overpowered and after that they got nerfed again. It's a vicious cycle of OMGPLZNERF circle-jerk, and making these things restricted could solve the problem.

I would also like to see sniper class being powerful but only like 2-4 snipers per team. Many people disagree with this

Squad leaders in other hand, but that is not enough. Remember that Soflam thing that I was talking about? Squad leaders should have exclusive access to this. Smoke should be squad leader exclusive too, but since people underestimate it and rarely use it, I do not think that is not necessary.

I live stream Battlefield 3 on twitch.tv and I upload videos to my YouTube channel. My streams and videos are watched by many

I have set up two servers for the event and I think other ones will be added before it starts. You can search for the servers by typing ""24 hour"" into the server browser. They will be marked as 24 Hour Charity Event For Prostate Cancer.

I know several people want to play with me so I will be switching squads

I have reached out to other YouTubers and asked them if they would like to participate in the event. You might be playing with/against Icemanauz, Tobbles, SG3089, and AmericanWarfare among others.

There will be giveaways for donors throughout the 24 hour period. These giveaways will be in 6 hour blocks

Unfortunately the minimum donation is $10. That is something I wasn't aware of until I had everything set up for the event. I apologize if anyone was hoping to donate less than that

Donating $10 will earn you one chance for the random drawing giveaway. You can earn additional chances for every $5 donated after the initial $10 donation. (i.e. a $20 donation earns you 3 chances/ a $25 donation earns you 4 chances)

I found two sponsors for the event who have graciously donated the prizes that will be given away. Please check out their websites for some very cool Battlefield 3 items.

We will also have a mini-game at times throughout the day called Stab and Bag. I don't want to share the details on the game at this time

I have set the goal for the donations at $500

Please send me a message if you would like to help out. I'm currently looking for other people who would like to rent servers. I am also looking for people who have a mic and wouldn't mind playing in one of the alternative servers to let everyone in the game know what is going on. I hope everyone can spread the word on this event. We are less than 26 hours away now :D

[Here is a more detailed analysis of the proposed method](http://i.imgur.com/UsnPzp6.png)

So

Currently, until the maximum is reached. The result is that you 'suppress' people every time you shoot at them. Which really isn't what suppressing fire, as a tactic, does.

So, or if they are just spraying and praying. The simple, yet effective way I came up with was placing suppression on a curve.

Now

The curve design is such that maximum suppression is reached at 25 shots

Furthermore

The result is that the suppressed player maintains combat effectiveness until they are supposed to die. As soon as terminal damage (potential) is reached the curve starts to rapidly climb. If a player survives the terminal damage, however, this occurs at roughly 2 seconds of shooting, which means they had 2 seconds to drop the enemy.

In summary:

The reasoning behind the curve is:

* To make suppression a decision.
* To benefit LMGs (25 shots is 5-6 shots less than most ARs are capable of).
* To improve overall balance of weapons (as combat accuracy would remain mostly unchanged for the duration of a 'balance' engagement).
* To reduce the abuse of suppression (High ROF weapons in full-auto would be balanced correctly).


Edit: I just noticed ROF is off so the time calculation is not quite accurate. The damage is correct in the source data... I just had the wrong title on the table.",self,t5_2rdgw,False,bf4,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1c4h1l/bf4suppression_idea_or_solution_if_you_will/

*sigh*

I waited for 40 minutes again to get in touch with someone and explained what had just happened. He asked me again for the key and went to verify it. When he came back he told me that my key was invalid and I should not bother them with illegal material.

After sending him a link to my BF2 stats page he gave in and asked me to send him a picture of the game-case and manual with the key in sight. I did this and he replied with: I want you to call this number and tell them what just happened. 
I was baffled by this because he had just given me an Irish(!!) number. After explaining that it would be cheaper to buy a new version of BF2 he guaranteed me that I could call for free on Skype

After waiting 40 minutes on the phone (40's the magic number today gents) skype stopped the call and informed me that I had spend all my credit.. Well crap.

A bit pissed I opened up the livechat again. This time I had to wait for only 20 minutes before I could talk to someone. I gave him the case ID's of the previous chats and told him that I could not call to Ireland anymore but really wanted the game to be downloadable in Origin. He asked me my secret question and went away for 2 minutes.

He told me to refresh my Origin page and I saw the BF2 complete package on the My Games tab. 

He said that for my troubles he got me the complete package to compensate for the long waiting time

So that is my story about how sometimes things can work out if you remain civil and calm during the whole ordeal.

I feel like some gaming companies and developers have just continued to copy and paste successful games, and release it at Christmas time for $60. Instead of copying and pasting games that people will like less and less as time goes on, why not take games from the past that people absolutely love, like Battlefield 1942, fine tune them with a new engine and some better features, and sell that! I know I would buy a console version of 1942 for $60 and a lot of other people would too!

With the improved fidelity on next gen consoles I think it's unnecessary and takes away from gameplay.

Tracers are used in battlefield on all weapons to help people identify incoming fire.  With all the abilities to to spot, and find people do we really need tracer rounds firing from every assault rifle, sniper rifle and pistol.  Removing these or making them an ammunition option would be great  for appropriate weapons.

By not having mandatory tracer rounds people could be more effective in flanking and you would think a little more when using an LMG as you will instantly give away your position.

Now for the setting. We already know that part of the campaign takes place in Baku, which is unfortunate because I want a new enemy that isn't Russian or Arab. I would much rather have a story take place in South America. There are very few games that tackle that setting. Think about it. Islands, jungles, bustling cities, farms, small villages, and markets.

First I would like to start by saying Yes

Now onto the point.

I am a fairly skilled BF3 player who gets more then his fair share of ""Hackusations"" and bans. I am not saying im some great player but I do understand the game pretty well. What I would like to do is create a small series of Video's that demonstrate and explain those non obvious events that sometimes set of your ""Oh hacks!"" alarm 

For example: I had one guy tell me that while in his tank he was killed with a .44 Magnum pistol. Sure that seems odd right? But now I can take that information and explain how it happens in a legit manner. (Play as support

So what I want to ask you guys is this.

What do you see on your screen when you think someone is not playing fair?

Are your accusations based on his score? Movement? Knowledge of where you are? Accuracy? Getting mad and need to vent? 

Any input would be greatly accepted!

The funny thing is, my server had a queue constantly because of the rules I enforce and the atmosphere generated because of it - and you can fact check me on bfstats or by showing up and talking to the locals. 

I [posted about the people threatening me with negative posts on the ps3bf3 subreddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/ps3bf3/comments/1bs8et/apparently_im_a_badmin/) and was met with some awesome responses about how I'm a horrid admin and that I should ""expect to be teamkilled"" if I'm playing hardcore.

I have really been enjoying both games.  BF2 still has a pretty dedicated community, I've had a blast, and I really regret not playing this game in it's prime.

I started playing Battlefield when Bad Company 2 was released.  To go back and play 2142 and BF2 has been an absolute blast!  I highly recommend both of these games; especially at $5 each!  I'll be playing these for years to come; assuming there are still servers to play on :(  Let's get more people playing 2142!

*EDIT: The sale is apparently only on until the 27th. Not much time left!

*EDIT 2: Looks like the sale is over :(  I hope they keep putting these old games on sale to get new players!

*EDIT 3: My only complaint about these older games is setting up resolution and punkbuster....

RESOLUTION FIX: Setting a custom widescreen resolution cannot be done in the graphics settings of these two games.  Instead you have to create a shortcut to the game .exe file and modify the shortcut properties.  [Details on how to do this here.](http://www.tweakguides.com/BF2142_9.html)

Obviously this stuff should all be posted to whatever forums EA has set up for feedback as well. 

Here goes:

**On Battlelog**

The interface is nice. It would be better to have it in game, the game would just pop right up. Load time was pretty fast for me.


I'd still like to try running the game from the Origin browser

**On Gameplay**


The Good:


During the Alpha


Unlocks are fun, but classes seem more appropriate to their jobs now: 


-Medic doesn't have a super OP machine gun


-Engineer is a blast. Submachine guns are lethal at close range, obviously.


-Sniper is sniper. I was afraid prone would make it super OP


-Knifing takes longer! Like paddles, and your soldier lifts him up off the ground, stabs him in the chest, and pulls of his tags. I thought this animation was great.


Destruction is great in general. Have to do some ""rocket noob"" testing tonight to see what I can and cannot destroy. Notable wins were minor walls and glass

Overall the game is a blast


The Bad:


With all the foliage in Metro

I(and others) noticed issues of clipping through the floor when moving uphill in prone position. Hopefully this will get resolved


Prone characters look like dead characters. The profiles are far to flat to the ground, then stand up. I'm not saying they should be marked, but a little bit more of a profile would be good.


It would be nice if my character wouldn't vault *everything* I try to jump over. I understand this isn't Assassin's Creed


Also, this might just be for stock weapons, but the two are NOT clones of each other, and feel remarkably different.


These are very minor gripes


**Interface**


The menu and class select system, with a few key changes. You now have the ability to change your permanent layout and weapon enhancements in a second menu. I was both excited and disappointed to see this, as it feels kind of COD-y.


The unlock system is kind of strange. It behaves just like the old one, just odd.

Things that seemed glitchy were:

-I couldn't use the chat feature while dead. While this is okay in that I shouldn't be able to shout warnings, but not during kit selection. Hm.


-The escape menu can only be accessed while you're alive


A quick note on graphics - The game is freaking beautiful. Awesome textures, I had most settings on ultra on a GTX 580 and I had no noticeable lag.

a little background on me: i just graduated high school and will soon advance to broke college student status. i currently work a minimum wage job at a pizza joint and have saved ~ 5000$ for the next year or so. im an avid battlefielder and fully intend on getting the next game however im not sure which platform i want to get it on. either way im upgrading from the playstation 3 which i currently own.

as far as paying for everything goes i fully intend on selling my playstation 3 to help pay for it (im not sure how much i could get but ive heard around 75$) as well as i already have 250$ in cash from graduation money that has not gone into my savings account. 

so here's a few of my thoughts as to the pro's of each:
PC: 

* better graphics

* better fps 
* better community (sorry console gamers

PS4: 

* cheaper. this is a huge selling point for me just because i really want to get the best gaming experience for my dollar. like i said

* also going to have 64 player servers and comprable graphics (so I've heard)

* going to be able to play all of my old ps3 games

so there's my situation and my thoughts on the matter. I would love to hear some advice from the battlefield community as to which route i should take!

For those of you who don't know me I go by the name of Big Mac.  I'm a long time Battlefield player who has been in and around the competitive community for a while now.   I'm here to let everyone I can know about a really cool event we have going on this Sunday at 12:00PM EST.   That is 6:00PM CET! 



Level BF is hosting the **Level Battlefield 5v5 Invitational.**  What this is is a multi-continent Battlefield tournament.   Level and our awesome sponsors have helped to bring together the top 16 teams from North America and the top 16 teams from Europe into two awesome brackets that come together for a NA vs EU final.   We will be **live casting** matches using a **free-cam** system for folks to enjoy and watch.  

Between the prizes generously donated by our sponsors and donations from many of the volunteers helping to run this tournament we have amassed a prize pool worth well over $3000 dollars which is HUGE for BF3.  

[Here is a link](http://invitational.levelbf.com/) to the Invitational's website for everyone to check out for details such as the tournament bracket

We have top NA teams like Nexus, siXFinns, and webSPELL.  


This tournament will run from the opening rounds THROUGH the finals starting Sunday the 23rd at 12:00PM EST.  So come check out the matches live-casted by Daskro, myself and plenty of others.

We have FOUR live-casted twitch streams for you to enjoy.  Two following the NA bracket and two following the EU bracket.    And we will have two streams watching the GRAND FINALS between the top NA team and the top EU team.   These streams provide an AWESOME perspective using a free-cam system.  

* [Stream Alpha](http://www.twitch.tv/levelbf)
* [Stream Charlie](http://www.twitch.tv/levelbf_charlie)
* [Stream Delta](http://www.twitch.tv/levelbf_delta)

Keep in mind that these will not go live UNTIL 12:00PM EST Sunday.  That is NOON for you folks that like to sleep in :P  



This is a really neat event thrown together by a bunch of folks that just really love Battlefield with the hopes of helping to spur Battlefield as an eSport.   I wanted to let as many of you know about it as possible because so many people put in a ton of hours over the last few months and we'd really like as many folks to enjoy this thing as possible. 

We're hoping more events like this can become a standard for the Battlefield franchise and your support helps show DICE how much we love some good ol' Battlefield action.  

Thanks for watching folks and I do hope you enjoy it.  If you do get a chance to watch some of the matches please leave feedback both in this post and in the twitch chat.  The more feedback we can get from you guys the better!  We want to continue to do these and your feedback helps tremendously.

I've reformatted my pc over 3 times now which solved nothing (and I goto school online, I've upgraded ram from 4gb to 6gb, I've switched between new Nvidia drivers and old legacy drivers.. Nothing fixes it, I'm still at 15fps on medium settings with a q6700 oc'd to 3.2ghz, 6gb ram, 80gb intel ssd, gtx 580

If your idea was inspired by something specific

My ideas:
Inspired from PR mod for BF2 and the BF3 Alpha testing and the US Army.

SQ spawning works like the BF3 Alpha

As for what Squads are, or 2 fireteams forms a squad, which the SL can give orders to FTL's who can give orders to specific individuals (he is a FTL as well)
He

SLs would also have the ability to place HMG's MK19s TOWs and Mortars down, by any team, it would take some time to set up so its fair.
As such Squad mates could request a certain one set up at certain points.

Here is what the BF3 menu should have looked like..

Source: was fan-made and tweeted by dice producer, about how awesome it was but no changes were ever made.


We all would like to see more squad customization, game-VOIP, server info in menu/scoreboard, a chat-log, more team player incentives, etc. If you are playing with friends in a party you should be able to lock your squad so you will always be with you're friends and won't be a victim of auto team balancing. They need to streamline it so when you join a server it auto-connects your friend's squad and other useful features.

* To me skyscraper collapse doesn't seem quite 'meaty' enough - it settles down way too quickly. IMHO the aftermathcollapse should last longer, and overall have more impact that even players on the other end of the river can feel.

* When in spectator mode you're focusing on a squad - you can't tell which team they're on because their icons are green. Maybe make icons appear in team color

* 3rd person view for spectator mode should feature adjustable zoom and ability to manually rotate the camera.

* A great addition for machinima makers would be ability to adjust camera angle and position in 3rd person view, under-the-wheels view, and other custom angles.

* ""Explosive"" icons appear for rockets and flares, so it's less distracting.

* **Destruction animation for jets and helicopters!** Please, like it happened in Bad Company 2 or even in that chase scene in BF4 single player. 

* The amount of verticality on Siege of Shanghai is great

* Jeeps would be more useful if driver was also the gunner, while passengers could shoot out of the windows, or possibly even out of that second hatch on the top of the jeep.

* Jet gameplay will be great on Siege of Shanghai

* Don't know if it's planned or not, like hard brakes, smoke screens, afterburners, so that jet combat becomes not just about speed control and turn fights.",Battlefield 4,False,t5_2rdgw,True

* Add more awareness to what your squadmates are doing.

I keep coming back to BF3 because I remember how much fun I used to have in Bad Company 2 with guys I used to play with on there. Which is where I have had some of my funnest moments in any shooter.

**THE BACKSTORY:**
---------------------
We are Battlefield gamers since 2002

During the last years
Because CoD is such a cash cow, in oder to get more sales.

While I can understand that plan from a business perspective
Anyone played *""Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon Future Soldier""*

If publishers want a piece of the CoD consumer cake
And not ruin their existing franchises for their original fanbase.

So up until Bad Company, did not have a lot in common. 
Starting with Bad Company

So all was *fine*
When we look at Battlefield 1942 and Battlefield 2

**So do not get me wrong here! Battlefield 3 is mostlikely one of the best shooters available!**. But it is also a casual shooter from top to the bottom

During the last year there were many petitions, explaining how much richer the experience was in the old games, and showing that there are still a lot of players who are in love with that kind of game.

So there was that. And we did not want to do any *""documentary""*. :-)

In February 2012
And this is what we now did in Battlefield:Crossover. We tell the story of an Squad Leader who suddenly finds himself inside Battlefield 3. 
While at first being fascinated by the visuals and sound

---------------------
**PRODUCTION:**
---------------------
We had the first idea in February 2012. Then we started to write a basic script

For the Battlefield 2 scenes I created a modification to make shooting the screens easier
There were 3 scenes for which I needed a greenscreen

Shooting all scenes took about 28 hours in total. Battlefield 3 is much more exhausting and frustrating to shoot because it does not have an demorecorder like Battlefield 2 has.

The most time was then spent on the post production. The editing

I can't even estimate how many work hours we put into this. But it will be well above 240 hours.

What I do know quite exactly is what the movie cost me. ;-)
BF2&amp;BF3 Server rent,- Euros *(or 649,78 USD)*.
