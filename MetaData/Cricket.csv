**Update Tea Day 1**
http://www.espncricinfo.com/the-ashes-2013/engine/current/match/566934.html

Australia looking good early until the wicket of Watson on 19. A controversial decision had Khawaja out of an *cough* edge. Rogers hit a suberb 84 off 114 before a lack of concentration saw him plum LBW off the bowling of Swann. Clarke has played aggressively against the spin and is on 55 off 90 with Smith Slowly building a total. 

p.s I sincerely apologise to Redditors expecting more from this thread. I honestly thought the match day thread was a race to who could go first without getting downvoted into oblivion or from moderators who set the thread - i guess the former is the case. Sorry for the lack of updates as i also thought that a thread was to be posted and then let the reddit cricket community debate/discuss

If the bot behaves erratically in the test threads on /r/howstat, it's just me tinkering around with certain things and that happens. I promise that by the time it's on /r/cricket, it'll be level-headed.

**Update:** Added filter variants. Like both *test* and *tests* work now

**Update 2:** Ranges in years. Scroll down to the filters.

-----

/u/howstat from /r/howstat

I felt that being able to whip up stats in-thread during match discussions would be very dandy. You know

I'm currently testing the bot [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/howstat/comments/1i53bs/test/) and [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/howstat/comments/1i78c7/test_2/). If you have feedback/feature requests or wanna help with testing (summoning the bot in a thread in /r/howstat)

------

**Summoning the bot:**

The bot responds when you call it with its name in a new line. The format of a request is this way:

*howstat &lt;player_name first

1. Case does not matter. odIS is the same as ODIs.
2. Please use the exact names for the filter values. ~~T20Is works
3. Ditto filters. *at* works, *at India* doesn't.
4. The request must be on a line of its own
5. The player's name must immediately follow the bot's name. Filters must follow the player's name
6. You can make no more than 3 requests in one comment. That should mean three different lines starting with 'howstat'.
7. Edits do NOT work. The bot does not revisit a comment that it has already dealt with.
8. Unless you specify a format
9. ~~As of now, that includes the Don too.~~

-----

**Filters added so far:**

*in* or *venue* - Venue Nation (See supported values below)

*at* - Home/Away/Neutral

**Some bla**:

The bot should respond within 1-2 minutes of a summon if everything goes well

I'm still working on the [code](http://github.com/pranavrc/howstat)

**Some more bla:**

Oh, it cannot post in a subreddit more than once in 10 minutes unless it's been added as an approved submitter. 

So the bot is NOT active in /r/cricket right now

This is a great community and 99% of people have nothing to worry about (i.e. if you're not a spammer

This also brings the current number of wiki pages to a massive 2. Huzzah! [You can view the wiki index here](http://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/wiki/index). Not a massive amount of info there for sure but hey it's a start.

Cheers

Oh and if you could spare an upvote for visibility that'd be great (no karma for me for this self post). Thanks

###Match Events

*NB: All times are BST (GMT+1)*

*Massive thanks to /u/TheIntersect for all the gifs. God knows how s/he gets them up so quick.*

**1131** It's been a while since I last did a match thread but here we go! Steve Smith on this way to 100

**1140** *Dropped! (Sort of)* Swann at short extra cover gets the ball walloped at him. His desperate attempts to clutch the ball are in vein as it bursts through [(see here for gifs)](http://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/1jjjrb/match_thread_the_ashes_england_vs_australia_3rd/cbffogs). A few balls later

**1145** Broad comes into the attack to show them what's what and starts off by angling one in to Clarkie's pads. The next ball goes for a single as Clarke reaches his highest test total against England (137).

**1155** And Clarke moves the score away from triple Nelson. 334-3.

**1205** Swanny on to bowl after drinks. Let's have a look at the Revometer... and it's 2173 RPM!

**1208** *Wicket! Steve Smith - 89(196) c. Bairstow b. Swann - 343-4 - [gif](http://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/1jjjrb/match_thread_the_ashes_england_vs_australia_3rd/cbffqtc) -* Swanny get's the breakthrough by dismissing our favourite Steve Smith. Smith goes for an elaborate slog-sweep and only gets a top edge on it and skies it to midwicket. Easy catch for Jonny Bairstow and we have to say goodbye to our sweet prince. Massive boos for Warner as he makes his way to the middle! [(gif - 'but I was saying ""booo-urns"")](http://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/1jjjrb/match_thread_the_ashes_england_vs_australia_3rd/cbfivqj)

**1225** *Review!* Warner ""nicked it"" behind and is given out. Poor review

**1226** *Wicket! Warner - 5(10) c. Trott b. Swann - 365-5 - [gif](http://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/1jjjrb/match_thread_the_ashes_england_vs_australia_3rd/cbffw2c) -* Swan turns it away from Warner who gets a fairly big edge. The ball hits Prior on the thigh and loops up to Trott at first slip. Pretty lucky for England but they'll take all the luck they can get! Chants of ""Cheerio"" ring out across the ground as Warner slumps back to the pavilion. Brad Haddin walks to the crease.

**1240** *Dropped!* Haddin gets a bottom edge trying to pull Anderson. Prior is moving to his right but has to quickly change direction diving down low to his left and doesn't quite get to the ball cleanly. The ball hits his wrist and pops out. [(gif right here)](http://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/1jjjrb/match_thread_the_ashes_england_vs_australia_3rd/cbfg49g)

**1259** Just received a Tesco delivery. 16 bottles of Cidré

**1300** Lunch!

**Lunch on day 2 - Australia 392-5 - [Scorecard](http://i.imgur.com/uhqR32d.png)**

And in Sky Sports' lunchtime feature

**1340** Swann kicks us off after lunch with some off-spin.

**1344** Broad at the other end to join Swanny.

**1420** *Wicket! Clarke - 187(314) b. Broad - 427-6 - [gif 1](http://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/1jjjrb/match_thread_the_ashes_england_vs_australia_3rd/cbfh4wu) &amp; [gif 2](http://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/1jjjrb/match_thread_the_ashes_england_vs_australia_3rd/cbfh78f) -* Broad finally gets his 200th wicket in tests! He bowls a fairly short ball to Clarke who has been running them down to third man all day

**1427** *Wicket! Siddle - 1(6) b. Swann - 430-7 - [gif](http://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/1jjjrb/match_thread_the_ashes_england_vs_australia_3rd/cbfh8i0) -* Swanny brings up his 5-fer by hitting Siddle's off-stump as he tries to cart Swann over midwicket. Left-hander Mitchell Starc takes up the striker's position.

**1443** Drinks! Australia are 439-7.

**1447** Quadruple Nelson and Starc tries hammering Swann down the ground but only manages to hit Brad Haddin. Good fielding by the Aussie batsman. [(gifs of the attempted murder)](http://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/1jjjrb/match_thread_the_ashes_england_vs_australia_3rd/cbfhlku) &amp; [(gif of a plastic bag drifting across the pitch)](http://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/1jjjrb/match_thread_the_ashes_england_vs_australia_3rd/cbfi3gw)

**1511** *Fifty up!* Brad Haddin brings up his 50 from 74 balls with a single. Australia 479-7.

**1518** *Hundred up!* All of England's frontline bowlers have now scored a century! [Well done boys!](http://i.imgur.com/evGt3tH.png)

**1536** *Five hundred up!* Australia are on 501-7 from 141.2 overs. Absolutely amazing batting so far.

**1538** *Fifty up!* Mitchell Starc brings his fifty up with a beautiful pull shot for four. 53 from 53 and no signs of slowing down! [(David Cameron wants this gif banned!)](http://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/1jjjrb/match_thread_the_ashes_england_vs_australia_3rd/cbfigov) &amp; [(gif of Mitchell Starc celebrating with a couple of England fans)](http://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/1jjjrb/match_thread_the_ashes_england_vs_australia_3rd/cbfiexf)

**1540** Tea time!

**Tea on day 2 - Australia 507-7 - [Scorecard](http://i.imgur.com/nnVeSm0.png)**

**1600** Swanny on after tea. Australia to continue the torture.

**1605** *Big appeal - not out!* Joe Root rapps Mitchell Starc on the pads and England go up in appeal. The umpire gives it not out and everyone gets on with their lives. Australia attacking more against Root for obvious reasons. Hawkeye shows that the ball was going on to hit the top of leg stump but as ""Umpire's call."" [(gif of the real-time decision)](http://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/1jjjrb/match_thread_the_ashes_england_vs_australia_3rd/cbfizmq) &amp; [(gif of the Hawkeye decision)](http://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/1jjjrb/match_thread_the_ashes_england_vs_australia_3rd/cbfj1eo)

**1614** Australia declare!

***End of Australia's 1st innings - 527-7 dec - [Scorecard](http://i.imgur.com/CKoaQhZ.png)***

***Start of England's 1st innings - Cook and Root to open***

**1624** England's innings is under way with Harris bowling the first over.

**1652** *Missed chance!* Wouldn't call this a drop by any means, but he just couldn't get there quick enough. [(As always, gif of the incident)](http://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/1jjjrb/match_thread_the_ashes_england_vs_australia_3rd/cbfk0q5) &amp; [(A perfect gif showing the difference between the Warner wicket and the Cook non-wicket)](http://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/1jjjrb/match_thread_the_ashes_england_vs_australia_3rd/cbfkbix)

**1748** Root has just hit a boundary!!! He moves onto 8 off 48 balls.

**1800** *Wicket! Root - 8(57) c. Haddin b. Siddle - 47-1 - [gif 1](http://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/1jjjrb/match_thread_the_ashes_england_vs_australia_3rd/cbfljyx) &amp; [gif 2](http://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/1jjjrb/match_thread_the_ashes_england_vs_australia_3rd/cbflmlj) -* Fantastic delivery from Peter Siddle as it looks like the ball was going on to just go over the top of off. Root sticks hit bat there but the ball straightens and finds a thin edge. Simple catch for Haddin and Tim Bresnan walks to the crease.

**1818** *Wicket! Bresnan - 1(15) c. Haddin b. Siddle - 49-2 - [gif](http://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/1jjjrb/match_thread_the_ashes_england_vs_australia_3rd/cbfm113) -* Bresnan tries pulling a ball that is just too low down

1367251451.0,1dceiw,"Hey r/Cricket, I don't post much often, but I thought I'd tell you about the most epic game of T20 I played over the weekend.",Sum1t,82,12, my captain held be back and sent me in at #10 while the score read 72/8 at 14.4.

Knowing we needed 36 off of 32 balls, leaving us with 16 runs needed off of 7 balls with me on the strike.  I got lucky and the bowler bowled a full length ball at the middle stump which I was able to hit right over long on for a flat six!

My heart was already racing from combination of some hard running and the adrenaline rush.  My teammate takes strike on the first ball, leaving us with 8 runs needed off of 4 balls.  Third ball, teammate airs the ball over the mid-wicket just inside the boundary, but the fielder drops the catch resulting in us running for 2.  Now it's 6 runs off of 3 balls.  Beautiful cover drive past the cover fielder which resulted in another 2 runs for us.  In the next ball, the teammate slogs one past mid wicket, but ball got stopped in its track between 30 yard and the boundary.  I had already called for two and was about half way back when the fielder throws the ball at my end.  I knew at this point only way I was going to make it is if I dove for the crease.  I must have flown at least 5 feet in the air (or at least that's what it felt like) and I made it all the while the bowler failed to collect the ball.  

Last ball remaining in regulation

I pretty much collapsed at this point while my teammates ran in and lifted us both in the air.  I am glad to say this was the most epic chase I have ever been part of that came down to the last ball.  We're 2-0 in T20s and one more win will ensure our spot in the playoffs.  Then starts the regular 40-over season.

TL;DR  Chased down 36 runs in 32 balls for the 9th wicket.  Needed 2 runs off of 1 ball and won with a six.  ",self,t5_2qhe0,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/1dceiw/hey_rcricket_i_dont_post_much_often_but_i_thought/

Let's have thoughts on the game

These are my expected sides

**Pakistan XI:**

Nasir Jamshed (Should be pretty matured by then)

Mohammad Hafeez (Should remain Vice captain and might have added a bit more consistency

**Proper Consistent Batsman** (Should be a permanent member of the side and emerged as a terrific batsman - an *Angel*)

Asad Shafiq / Umar Amin (Whoever establishes him as the permanent batsman in the side by then)

Misbah-Ul-Haq (Captain)

Umar Akmal (No other choice for a place of an aggressive at No. 6)

Kamran Akmal (The experiment of his brother should have failed by then and he will be recalled)

Shahid Afridi (Afridi will be Afridi

Saeed Ajmal (Should be in the top 10 bowlers

Muhammad Irfan (Provided his fitness enables him)

Junaid Khan / Mohammad Aamir (Junaid definitely


**India XI:**

I don't see any changes in India by then as the current team has recently won a title and we Asians usually have permanent spots after a major title win. The big question for India will be on 3 players:

**Virender Sehwag**

**Yuvraj Singh**

**Harbhajjan Singh**

I think out of these 3

And of course

###Match Updates:

*Note: All times are BST (GMT+1)*

*Note: Thanks to /u/TheIntersect for all gifs!*

**1146** Just woke up and showered so I'll be starting updates from here. Here are some gifs of Bell's and Prior's dismissals though. [Bell](http://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/1k6xvy/match_thread_the_ashes_england_vs_australia_test/cbm1x5s) - [Prior](http://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/1k6xvy/match_thread_the_ashes_england_vs_australia_test/cbm1xrp)

**1146** *Wicket! Stuart Broad 13(7) - c. Smith b. Harris - Eng 275-8 - [gif](http://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/1k6xvy/match_thread_the_ashes_england_vs_australia_test/cbm1yvp) -* Just as I start the updates Broad gets out! Harris

**1201** *Drinks! - Eng 306-8 -* Bresnan carting it all over the place

**1222** *Wicket! Tim Bresnan 45(90) - c&amp;b. Harris - Eng 317-9 - [gif](http://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/1k6xvy/match_thread_the_ashes_england_vs_australia_test/cbm28y0) -* It's that man Harris again! A good length

**1225** *Dropped! Steve Smith drops Greame Swann! - [gif!](http://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/1k6xvy/match_thread_the_ashes_england_vs_australia_test/cbm2azk) -* Swanny tries to smash Nathan Lyon for a big six over long-on but doesn't get enough of it. Steve Smith comes round to take a fairly simple catch but can't cling onto it. Poor effort by Smith and Swann carries on banging it all over the place

**1231** *Wicket! James Anderson 0(5) - c. Haddin b. Lyon - Eng 330 all out - [gif](http://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/1k6xvy/match_thread_the_ashes_england_vs_australia_test/cbm2bss) -* Beaut of a delivery from Nathan Lyon from round the wicket to the left-hander. Jimmy gets a feather through to the 'keeper and walks off. Lyon finishes off with a 3-fer.

**1231 End of England's 2nd innings - 330 all out - [Scorecard](http://i.imgur.com/ZI0io3A.png) - Australia need 299 runs to win

**1241 Start of Australia's 2nd innings - Rogers and Warner to open for Australia

**1251** *England review for LBW! - Umpire's call: Not out - 3rd umpire's decision: NOT OUT -* Replays show that the ball pitched outside leg and frankly it was obvious in real-time too. Wasted review from England who only have 1 left in the innings.

**1301** *Lunch!*

**1344** *Rain stopped play :( -* Big covers are on. I'll update here with any new info.

**1433** *Play to restart at 1450 -* [Here are the new times for the day's play.](http://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/1k6xvy/match_thread_the_ashes_england_vs_australia_test/cbm3v34)

**1449** *The umpires were lying! Play has restarted at 1449*

**1504** *Australia review! Rogers caught behind - Umpire's call: Out - 3rd umpire's decision: NOT OUT - [gif](http://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/1k6xvy/match_thread_the_ashes_england_vs_australia_test/cbm493c) -* Another poor decision by Tony Hill. Replays show that the ball hit Roger's hip on the way through to Matt Prior.

**1510** *Dropped! Swann drops Rogers diving full-length at 2nd slip - [gif](http://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/1k6xvy/match_thread_the_ashes_england_vs_australia_test/cbm4c9g) -* Top effort by Swann as Rogers edges it off Bresnan's bowling. He just can't hold onto it though with his right hand.

**1550** *Drinks!*

**1620** Match update due to boredom. I hope something happens in the next 3 minutes...

**1622** *100 up! -* That'll do! Something happened! Australia's highest opening partnership this series comes at a good time. Rogers &amp; Warner on 45 &amp; 48 respectively.

**1624** Shout out to /u/GurraJG who is updating us on the Ladies' Ashes in the comments below.

**1629** *50 up for Warner! -* Seems like I missed Warner getting his 50 as I was getting some food.


**1631** *Wicket! Chris Rogers 49(100) - c. Trott b. Swann - Aus 109-1 - [gif](http://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/1k6xvy/match_thread_the_ashes_england_vs_australia_test/cbm604w) -* England finally break this outstanding opening partnership thanks to Swann and his round-the-wicket off spin. Edged by Rogers to Trott at slip. Kawaja in for Australia.

**1634** *Nelson! Aus 111-1*

**1646** *Tea!*

---

**Tea - Australia 120-1 - [Scorecard](http://i.imgur.com/aQPIVXQ.png) - Australia need 179 runs to win

Women's Ashes - England 126/6 (44 overs) trail Australia 331/6d by 205 runs.

---

**1712** Sorry guys! Forgot to mention tea had finished and play has started again.

**1726** *Wicket! Usman Kawaja 21(35) - LBW b. Swann - Aus 147-2 - [gif](http://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/1k6xvy/match_thread_the_ashes_england_vs_australia_test/cbm7adc) -* Swann bowls a full

**1744** *Wicket! David Warner 71(113) - c. Prior b. Bresnan - Aus 168-3 - [gif](http://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/1k6xvy/match_thread_the_ashes_england_vs_australia_test/cbm7kxg) -* Bresnan bowls a good length delivery just outside off to Warner which bounces up a little and nips away from the left hander. Warner gets a tickle of an edge through to the 'keeper and departs for a very well played 71. Steve Smith to the crease.

**1801** *England review! Smith caught behind - Umpire's call: Not out - 3rd umpire's decision: NOT OUT -* Good decision from Tony Hill [not a typo] as replays show that the ball came off Smith's hip. England have no reviews remaining.

**1811** *Wicket! Michael Clarke 21(27) - b. Broad - Aus 174-4 - [gif](http://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/1k6xvy/match_thread_the_ashes_england_vs_australia_test/cbm87v3) -* PEACH of a delivery from Broad

**1822** *Wicket! Steve Smith 2(19) - b. Broad - Aus 175-5 - [gif](http://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/1k6xvy/match_thread_the_ashes_england_vs_australia_test/cbm8glz) -* Steve Smith tries hooking one short and down leg but somehow manages to drag it back in and down onto his stumps. An incredibly unlucky way of getting out for the man who isn't having a good day and Australia are living very dangerously now. Brad Haddin in to try and steady the ship.

**1828** *Australia review! Watson (obviously) LBW - Umpire's call: Out - 3rd umpire's decision: UMPIRES CALL (OUT)*

**1829** *Wicket! Shane Watson 2(11) - LBW b Bresnan - Aus 179-6 [gif](http://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/1k6xvy/match_thread_the_ashes_england_vs_australia_test/cbm8nd8)*

**1837** *Australia review! Haddin LBW - Umpire's call: Out - 3rd umpire's decision: UMPIRES CALL (OUT) -* Australia have no reviews left.

**1829** *Wicket! Brad Haddin 4(6) - LBW b Broad - Aus 181-7 - [gif](http://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/1k6xvy/match_thread_the_ashes_england_vs_australia_test/cbm8vxu) -* An INCREDIBLY close LBW decision, England are sure to win this game and the series.

**1859** *Wicket! Ryan Harris 11(18) - LBW b Broad - Aus 199-8 - [gif 1](http://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/1k6xvy/match_thread_the_ashes_england_vs_australia_test/cbm9com) &amp; [gif 2](http://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/1k6xvy/match_thread_the_ashes_england_vs_australia_test/cbm9eq8) -* Broad bowls one that nips back a little and traps Harris in front of middle and leg. It looked absolutely plumb and Tony Hill (and Shane Warne) agrees with me. Nathan Lyon in for Australia.

**1901** England have taken the extra 30 minutes. Play will continue until 1930 local time.

**1903** *200 up!* Australia edge closer to the target with a nice boundary from Peter Siddle.

**1908** *Dropped! Swann dropps Lyon - [gif](http://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/1k6xvy/match_thread_the_ashes_england_vs_australia_test/cbm9mc4) -* Quite poor from Swann as the ball comes quickly to him at 2nd slip as Lyon attempts to leave it. Broad not happy as that would've been his 5-fer and 10th wicket in the match.

**1915** *Wicket! Nathan Lyon 8(10) - b. Broad - Aus 211-9 - [gif](http://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/1k6xvy/match_thread_the_ashes_england_vs_australia_test/cbm9qlv) -* Broad bowls a beauty of a full delivery. Swinging into Lyon and taking out his leg stick. Broad brings up his 10-fer in the match and Jackson Bird comes in. A quick-fire 50 wouldn't do the Aussies any harm here.

**1921** Joe Root comes on for England as Cook is told to bowl his slower bowlers.

**1926** *England take the extra half-hour -* But they still have to bowl Root and Swann.

**1929** The sun is back out and the pitch looks noticeably brighter. Broad starts warming up.

**1932** The sun has gone back in and Root has to carry on bowling instead of Broad.

**1934** The sun is back out and Jimmy Anderson comes on for Swann and Stuart Broad comes on for Root.

**1940** *Wicket! Peter Siddle 23(48) - c. Anderson b. Broad - Aus 224 all-out - [gif](http://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/1k6xvy/match_thread_the_ashes_england_vs_australia_test/cbmabym) (this gif brought to you by /u/OlehHilly) -* Broad bowls one outside off

Steve's son, obviously helps when you can get coaching from a player like Steve. He had a pretty decent defence, and was great through the offside. He also played a few slog sweeps, one of his fathers signature shots.

In the 2nd innings, they are only 12/13yr olds). Steve was at the game, and in the last 10 overs he was walking around the field, so as to give advice to his son.(Rules of the comp state that coaches cannot give instruction to the players during overs, only during drinks/lunch/tea)

No rule about anything from the parents. Steve pretty much was setting the field for the team through his son lol. It worked and the batting team lost a few wickets. Match was still tight towards the end

**1143** *Wicket! Swann out for 11* - Swann came out to attack

**1202** *Drinks* - England currently 361/9. I'll be leaving temporarily

**Lunch** Australia 24/1 Warner 12 (17)

Once again I am going out for a bit

**1515** *SIX!* - Steve Smith hits a glorious six

**1527** *Smith run out  for 19 off 19 balls* - A third umpire decision reveals Smith was outside the crease

**1627** *Bad light stopped play* - In what is sure to be a controversial decision

Practically

As far as I can see the benefits would be:

* consistency of formatting from thread to thread

* OP wouldn't recieve thousands of profane orangereds during controversial moments

* Match Thread OP's would be

The downsides:

* Mods aren't always around to respond to requests immediately

* Would require more heavy-handed moderation in terms of removing non- approved match threads.

i still remember the groans and the look of disappointment coming from the team, and no one really spoke to me.  and then this younger guy just tapped me on the shoulder as we were crossing at the end of the over and said, ""chin up kid, get the next one!"" 

he looked over and smiled at me every now and again and geave me a big thumbs up and a grin when i fielded the ball.  but a few overs later the same fat number 3

I couldn't believe it, old enough to play for us again!

I nearly cried! 

but my hands hurt.

This lesson has always stayed with me and i would love to hear more early cricket memories.  I am currently my teams top out field catcher with 5 in 3 games and no drops.  inspiration goes a long way.

Now without further ado

-	**Best Post:** [Tendulkar + Zaheer Khan = Jacques Kallis](http://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/136c2m/tendulkar_zaheer_khan_jacques_kallis/) posted by /u/rtza. This category was very close

-	**Best Comment:** [The origin of ‘Gusset’](http://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/o2mwt/match_thread_india_vs_australia_2nd_test_scg_day_3/c3e0dxc) posted by /u/smurf42. A clear winner in this case. Note that smurf42 has been deemed winner as his comment turned the autocorrect mistake into the meme it is today.

-	**Best Submitter:** /u/jimsaysdoitthisway. Clear winner in votes.

-	**Best Commenter:** /u/jimsaysdoitthisway. Clear winner again

-	**Best Joke/Meme Post:** [My philosophy about this subreddit

Now for what we thought were the best cricketing performances of 2012. These categories were included for interest only:

-	**Best Match of 2012:** [South Africa in Australia Test Series - 2nd Test at Adelaide](http://www.espncricinfo.com/australia-v-south-africa-2012/engine/match/573008.html). Clear winner. Who but a cricket fan would’ve thought a match which included a team batting at a run rate of only 1.67 an over could be voted best of the year? A rail nail-biter

-	**Best Batting Performance(s) of 2012:** [Michael Clarke 329* vs India](http://www.espncricinfo.com/australia-v-india-2011/content/story/548142.html) and [Faf du Plessis 110* vs Australia](http://www.espncricinfo.com/magazine/content/story/593809.html). Voting for both of these was so close I had to call it a tie

-	**Best Bowling Performance of 2012:** [Peter Siddle vs South Africa in the Adelaide Test](http://www.espncricinfo.com/australia-v-south-africa-2012/content/story/593277.html) Clear winner in votes. Match figures of 63.5 overs

-	**Best Cricket Moment of 2012:** [Ricky Ponting’s retirement and the farewell given by South Africa](http://i.imgur.com/siH7p.jpg). Clear winner in votes. Australia’s leading run scorer

Copy-pasted into a self-post to avoid blogspam

***

Ashton Agar

That story starts with a 19-year-old who strolled to the crease with his team sitting at 9-117

Agar started out with a cool attitude and patience that seemed out of ordinary for a tail-ender. Was it by chance that the new kid had been defaulted to the bottom because of his lack of test experience? As he refused to get out

Suddenly boundaries started to flow. England's short balls and attempts to give Agar a rough welcome into test cricket were pushed aside. The home side persisted in striding away from the tight line they had demolished the upper order with and paid the price for it.

Ashton had his 50 in as many deliveries and there was now more than a hint of concern among the home crowd and team. Who is this young man? Why is he at the bottom when his refuses to put a foot wrong with the bat? Turns out

Twitter blew up with #Ashtag and #Ashton making the rounds quicker than the youngster could find the boundary rope. That says a lot considering his golden innings consisted of 12 fours and a pair of sixes. Popularity stemmed not just from his surprisingly adept technique

Sixty. Seventy. Eighty. Ninety. The runs kept coming. It was only in an Graeme Swann over where Agar finally looked like he was being truly tested. But he made it through.

Then the unbreakable kid from Western Australia finally snapped. He had missed several tempting pull shots from the hands of Stuart Broad before finally bashing one into the mitts of Swann in the deep on-side. The tactics that had done nothing to him early in his innings had finally lured him into a simple mistake

It had been a long time since I had watched a sporting event where I felt my heart physically sink. I felt like I had been robbed of a moment

Then Agar removed his helmet and beamed with a smile that forced a similar one out of me. He didn't care. He had helped lift a poor side into a winning position on cricket's biggest stage

Agar didn't just change the history books

The man clearly knew how to make the most out of a situation

Australia took of lead into the 2nd innings of England. A lead. From 98 runs down on the last wicket. Let the enormity of that sink in

It would be criminal to forget the contribution of the man at the other end

Hughes ended his innings on 81 not out

In an innings full of highlights

This is just a selection of the records that were broken on day 2 at Nottingham:

* Highest 10th wicket partnership in test cricket history

* Highest score by a number 11 in test cricket history

* Highest score by a number 11 on debut. More than doubles Wawrick Armstrong's 45 from 1902.

* 2nd fastest test 50 on debut

* 2nd debutant to finish with the highest test score at number 11

* The third time the 10th wicket pair have doubled their team's score (remember Lyon/Siddle in South Africa? 47? Yep

* 5th Australian 100-run 10th wicket partnership

Well played

* I don't know about you guys but it almost seems to me that the Indian team just doesn't care.. It seems to me that they never cared. The way their body language looks after the first day of every match is a testament of their non-chalance.

* Ishant said to the Australian players ""Wait till you come to India."" That's the problem! Indian wickets are not optimized to promote test cricket. They are made to kill test cricket. Indian pitches are fast bowler graveyards and the tests are all about which team's players can plonk their front foot down and smash the most runs. Watching a Test match in India is about empty stands and shitty games and the BCCI is to blame.

* A lot of people will say that players like Dravid and Tendulkar are untouchable. People get pissy when I criticize Laxman here on /r/cricket. I feel that its time they all fucked off.

* Dhoni can fuck off too. The truth is that he is not a Test captain. He made a lot of mistakes with strategy in the field. He did not perform with that bat. But all of that can be forgiven if his attitude was better. He just shrugs it all of and gives off the vibe that Test cricket is not important for him. We all know how intense all these guys will be when they play the IPL. Thats what they care about! Those who don't care about Test cricket should not be picked in the team!

* The BCCI needs to be made more transparent and more accountable to the fans. There needs to be some law or some change in something that ends the BCCI's secrecy and dominance in cricket. That is the bottom line. Edit Srikanth must go as chief selector

**1413** *Trott caught* - Trott plays at a bouncer and gloves it behind

**1506** *50 partnership and 100 up* - A 2 deep to the boundary from Pietersen simultaneously brings up the 50 partnership and 100 from England. Both batsmen contributed 25 to the partnership.

Gifs are back! Keep up with them thanks to /u/TheIntersect

**1824** *Bairstow edges to Haddin* - Bairstow once again fails to get in properly

**1838** *Bell centruy!* - After surviving a risky edge that was just out of Clarke's reach

1. The flair system has been modified. The first change is that IPL teams have been added. This is part of a plan we have to implement more flair options - some people have requested IPL flair and considering this league is on right now we figured this would be a good place to start. There are plans to implement flair for other cricket leagues worldwide if there is enough interest (county cricket would probably be next - is there enough interest to support this?).

2. The second change to the flair system is that when you hover your mouse over someone's flair it should now pop-up to tell you who they're supporting. With new flair being added this should make it easier to tell who's who. Unfortunately the problem with this is that it does not apply to existing flair. So everyone that already has a country flag will need to reselect it if they want text to pop-up when people mouse hover over it. All new flair selected will have this done by default.

3. We've asked /u/sunnydelish to return as a moderator of r/cricket. For those that remember sunny

4. Some people may have noticed a few users (or former users) recently making their thoughts known that they think r/cricket is heading in the wrong direction regarding post quality. At the moment we don't think there's a reason to make any changes to what can or can't be posted because we feel like we get a good mix of humour and discussion. As sub-reddits grow though they generally reach a point where they need to decide whether they want to start implementing stricter rules on content (things like banning memes and/or novelty accounts

5. A lot of people enjoyed the couple of ""trash talk threads"" that we've had over the last few months, try not to make these too often but rather save them for special occasions (i.e. group multiple matches into one thread if possible).

Thanks for taking the time to read the above, and we'd like to thank everyone for helping to make it so great.

tl;dr: new flair is available, and you can now make sledge threads for FRIENDLY banter and gentle ribbing.",,False,self,t5_2qhe0,False,ca,moderator

That is absolutely pathetic.

I also found this link that shows how much PCB pays its players: http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5juauQtarAYHIKuUnSxfFwkNEvNPw?docId=CNG.54772f5d47fa56c8bfc69755c8092bcd.31

That shows that the highest paid players get $3400 per month, but I think only a small minority of guys like Afridi or Ajmal get anything significant from sponsorships. $40,800 for the highest paid cricketers in Pakistan sounds pretty pathetic. I think even Bangladesh or Sri Lanka pay their players a lot more. Plus their top guys get a lot more money playing IPL etc.

It's no wonder these guys end up doing anything for money. Being a cricketer for Pakistan is probably the worst financially out of all the major Test playing nations. ",self,t5_2qhe0,False,,pakistan,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/1b6jcb/and_you_wonder_why_pakistanis_get_involved_in/

* Watching cricket on Indian TV is a nightmarish experience. Every single available inch of the screen is covered with ads. They sometimes cut the last and first balls of overs. Cricket is relegated to the back. 

* The BCCI's lack of transparency. They have a gag-order on the coach. We know literally nothing about Duncan Fletcher's strategies and plans for the team. The paying public deserves to be part of this important aspect of the game. We know nothing about selection meetings
*  Although this is getting slightly better

The URL is http://cricket.addict.net.nz (hopefully it doesn't die too quickly)

It's only got data from test matches at the moment

The graphs show each innings for the player in match/innings order in blue and an average in red after each innings (I'm not sure if that's called a rolling average).

Some examples - [Alistair Cook](http://cricket.addict.net.nz/players/2473/chart), [Hashim Amla](http://cricket.addict.net.nz/players/26/chart), [Jacques Kallis](http://cricket.addict.net.nz/players/27/chart)

The graph gets a bit squished with the players that have a lot of innings.

One thing to note, but it's probably true of other players as well.

1327821668.0,p1hw2,In recent years test results have been dominated by the home team. One team bucks the trend.,siener,37,4,29,"Home ground advantage has always been a huge factor in test cricket.

I thought I'd investigate the phenomenon by looking at the last five years of test cricket using Cricinfo's Statsguru.

Unsurprisingly

Look at [away games](http://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/stats/index.html?class=1;filter=advanced;home_or_away=2;orderby=win_loss_ratio;spanmax1=29+Jan+2012;spanmin1=29+Jan+2007;spanval1=span;template=results;type=team) and the picture looks completely different. Only three teams have won more than they've lost when not playing at home. Australia (won 9 lost 8) and England (won 8 lost 6) are only just on the right side of that ratio.

The team that stands out is South Africa. They've won almost three times as many away games as they've lost. In fact

Looking at their [series results](http://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/stats/index.html?class=1;filter=advanced;groupby=series;home_or_away=2;home_or_away=3;orderby=start;spanmax1=29+Jan+2012;spanmin1=29+Jan+2007;spanval1=span;team=3;template=results;type=team) one sees that they've not lost a single away series in the past five years. They won in Australia, the West Indies and Bangladesh and they drew in India (twice) and in the UAE against Pakistan. India's only two home defeats in tests during this period (mentioned above) were both at the hands of South Africa.

What is the point of all this? After England's loss against Pakistan and Australia'a whitewash of India some English and Aussie supporters started talking about the 2013 Ashes. It might just be a bit early for that - the Proteas will be visiting both your shores this year (and those of NZ),False,self,t5_2qhe0,False,,safrica,t3_p1hw2

1354526506.0,146z8t,South Africa have now beaten both England and Australia in two consecutive away test series. ,TheJediJew,32,2,20,"In 2008 South Africa beat England 1-2 in a 4 match test series. It was the first time they had won a series in England since readmission (having drawn 1-1 won in 1994

Three months later they followed up by beating Australia 1-2 away also for the first time since readmission (having drawn 1-1 in 1993/94

Fast forward 4 years and history has repeated itself with South Africa beating England 0-2 and Australia 0-1 in the space of 3 months.

I am an extremely proud South African today. The character we have shown over both of these recent series has been world class. We are blessed with some outstanding talents in Steyn, we are getting the best out of our raw talent.

Huge credit must go to Gary Kirsten (second consecutive side he has coached to number 1) and his team. We couldn't have done this without them.

We had managed to get a full XI out

After winning the toss

Myself and a seasoned member opened the bowling. After a few looseners
And soon after fell the wickets of the 3rd

I had quickly gathered the wickets and had attained my maiden 5-wicket haul.


At this point I brought in my first change bowlers

After demolishing the opposition with the ball we had a slender target of 28 to win the match.

At this point
And in a short period of time we had chased down the target for the loss of three wickets.

An important success was the intensity in the field for us. We didn't have to do much
3 catches in slip

The taking of catches in slip was key to the removal of the top 4 batsmen. And something which a specific fielding pre-season session has enabled us to hit the ground running with.

The game today has allowed us to throw the gauntlet down to the rest of the league opposition. An intimidating win in which we completed a game in 2 hours where we would normally be spending nearer 5 to 6 hours playing.

I'm not getting carried away though

On a personal note though; I was ecstatic about getting my first 5-wicket haul today. Best feeling ever. [finished with figures of 4 overs

PS: If [/r/cricket](/r/cricket) doesn't want to hear from me anymore I'm more than happy stop posting. Just thought I'd keep you updated with what started last year

I would almost go as far as to say we've attempted something I don't think anyone else has in this sense. 

That taken into consideration I would say today was pretty damn successful.  I have received at least 30 messages saying how great and refreshing it has been to listen to people talking about cricket who do have opinions and don't dance around the topic to not offend anyone. 

We peaked at 84 listeners at the highest

Something else cool to mention is to just think of the logistics of what we accomplished. We had complete strangers from, Canada Pakistan, China, New Zealand, India and South Africa all turn up to a random voice chat and instantly connect over something we all love. There was no rudeness or bitterness it was all about the love of our cricket. Bloody awesome I must say. 

A few things for tomorrow. I was going to suggest people staying out of the google hangout unless they are commentating or are just about to

We hit 84 listeners at the peak. Lets try get 100 tomorrow and try hold it around that mark. 

Anywhere you can post the mixlr.com link is a bonus. Hopefully we can cross post it in a few different subs tomorrow with some success. Any streams

Lets also try be more interactive with the reddit stream and ask questions to be answered there or on the chat. 

The delay between the streams is obviously an issue and until I figure a way to stream the commentary over a video stream it's going to stay an issue. I will find a way asap. 

In the meantime what we kind of defaulted to doing was having great discussions about cricket

So after that giant wall of text I'll just say a massive thank you to you guys for turning one little crazy idea into this. I hope you will all stick with me/us while we try grow this thing and iron out all the bugs. Without all your knowledge of cricket in various aspects today would of been a disaster. 

Also thanks to all the mods on r/cricket absolute champs. 

So one last celebratory 2am beer before bed for a great day of cricket and some new mates.

1333863673.0,ryxbg,An American view of the IPL,mimicthefrench,35,4,15,"So after following cricket for 4 months and being thoroughly entertained by every level of the sport I've watched

First of all, it's obnoxious, it's in your face. Advertising is everywhere, and the whole thing is highly commercialized. T20 doesn't have as much strategy, nor as much nuance as test or even ODI cricket. I also could not really identify with any of the teams, since it's not clear what identities they have in terms of fanbase, style of play, probably almost as much as it bothers any of you.

But to an outsider like myself who's lived with baseball, this felt more like the sports I'm used to. It was comparable in length to an American football or baseball game, and it was exciting the whole way through. Due to the T20 format, both teams were extremely aggressive when batting, and therefore the run rates were higher and wickets fell more often. The crowd was very large and very loud, and the announcers were much closer to the ""all excitement, all the time"" of American sports. The advertising did not bother me all that much - in fact, something any American network would have done without hesitation

If anything is going to make cricket break into the US, and unashamedly outrageous. A couple of my friends in the studio with me came over at one point and were immediately drawn to the game in a way they hadn't been on a previous occasion when I had been watching an ODI match. 

It has its positives and negatives, at the least, a valid version of the sport. I think I used the analogy of NASCAR and Formula 1 the other day to explain why both IPL-style T20 and longer-form, more traditional cricket can coexist peacefully: Sure, T20 and NASCAR dumb down their respective sports to reach a more causal audience, but they're not stealing viewers or money from each other, save for the occasions they happen to coincide on the calendar. NASCAR is easy for the less-sophisticated amongst us (coughstupidamericanslikemecoughcough) but some of those fans will find their way to other versions of the sport. In the same way, but then get drawn in by the beauty of the game and perhaps end up as fans of the sport as a whole and not just that one version of it.


tl;dr: IPL has its ups and downs but in the end


Wow that's a lot of text. I'd love to hear some other viewpoints

**1714** *Wicket! Ross Taylor - lbw b. Anderson - 100-3 -* After a fantastic knock of 66 from 72 balls

**1734** *Dropped!* Kane Williamson got a faint outside-edge from a wonderful Jimmy Anderson delivery

Hilfenhaus is currently ranked as the world's 10th best test bowler by the ICC. He is ranked ahead of names such as Johnson, Rehman, Khan and Umar Gul. He is a *single point* behind Morne Morkel in these rankings. While I'll admit these may not refer explicitly to current form, they do show how consistent Hilfenhaus has been over the last 18-24 months in test cricket. You must have done something right if you can miss out on  3.5 tests in the summer and still hold a place in the top 10 rankings.

Furthermore

Lastly - while his first 2 games this summer weren't amazing - he still averaged 34, we should not.

Just to give you some context on Hilfenhaus' apparently ""mediocre"" matches against South Africa - in those same 2 matches Peter Siddle averaged over 38 with the ball, well done once again.

2) for the biggest nations, both batting and bowling?  Wouldn't you want different personalities for each?

3)  Do Captains plan to have specific bowlers matched against specific partnerships, etc.?  Why do they sometimes change bowlers out that seem to be having a lot of success?

I do not feel comfortable charging against spinners and lofting them over their head. Will appreciate any comments on what my technique should be. If you have a link of a certain player playing straight drive using his feet against slow bowler

**Update**: Thanks for the response guys. Few things that i didn't mention first time around:)
I am half-decent right-hand batter (being modest here). Have scored 750 League runs @ average of 65 (in last season) in Division 1 of (Amateur league) where 20 other teams take part
--&gt;English conditions and mostly uncovered pitches so you have to negate the unpredictability of pitches!
--&gt;The reason i have scored so many runs is because i play late and put a high premium on my wicket.
--&gt; Don't face many spinners in the league but when i do i can easily negate them by playing sweep or just blocking out! Sweep is kind of my release-pressure shot and i connect more often than not :)
--&gt; I feel one way to improve my batting is to learn to play them straight. You see what happens is after i have swept them for four they bowl a fast one straight on my feet and me being kind of unsure/less-confident just block it even though i expected the quicker ball from spinner! Thats why i wanna improve my feet work

End of the 7th over, the batsmen are effectively encouraged to hit in the air. Their tidy opening bowler begins his 4th over with a couple of dots, then 3rd ball our number 5 dances down the pitch and middles a straight drive. 

Now even as a young(ish) player I'm not sure if I could have got out of the way, before he crumpled in a heap. I initially thought it had hit him high on the chest, but everyone shouting to call an ambulance quickly clarified the severity of the impact.

Five minutes later they arrive and are concerned because one of his pupils is unresponsive

Another ten minutes later, then whisked away in the helicopter.

We were told that while in the ambulance his pupils had returned to normal

The game was abandoned

Returning home I have just received an update that he's being operated on to remove pressure on his brain, no one sure if he would be ok.

What can be deduced is that a lot of these tournaments have been held in Asia where Sri Lanka of course thrive and where tournament organisers would hope that Sri Lankan fans would turn up in their numbers. However

The failure to clear the last hurdle has created an almost psychological block for most Sri Lankan fans. However

**Windies' two unlikely triumphs**

At exactly the halfway stage of the West Indian innings, Kulesekera and Mendis were asphyxiating an explosive lineup and were controlling the game. The ensuing fireworks from Samuels &amp; co, then, wrestled the game back. It was a comeback that didn't look likely but even at the innings break, Sri Lanka's Angelo Mathews opined that the Windies' were 20 runs short. He wasn't fooling anyone, for even Mahela's face etched worry. 

The momentum was swinging the way of the Caribbean and the dismissal of Dilshan stifled Sri Lanka's run chase. The West Indies playing in a cauldron of cacophonous

The 2004 Champions Trophy final too, one can sense that the situations have parallels. On both occasions, the Windies' had to play against the host nation and had to outmatch a very worthy opponent.
