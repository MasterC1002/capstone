1344579597.0,xzgte,My Goodbye Letter to Teavana,rcgold,209,58,176,"Dear Teavana

You have lost my business as a lifelong customer. As a loyal customer to Teavana

I visited the Fox Valley Mall Teavana Store on 08/09/2012 at around 6/7pm. I was used to buying my tea at the Schaumburg, thinking the store was offering free tea, but I knew the employee was slyly trying to get us to buy a cup of tea from the tea bar; I politely declined. I then browsed the store and approached the counter. Again the same employee asked me if he should start brewing up a cup for us to walk around the mall with, I declined him again and told him I wanted to purchase loose leaf tea. 

I told him I wanted a Christmas like tea similar to that of Samurai Chai Mate and he then proceeded to bring down two teas and presented each. He told me that popularly a combination blend of both of the teas was always purchased by most customers. He then asked me if I had a bin for the tea
 
After that he then pressed me for purchasing and asked if I would be buying two canisters of each. I asked him how many ounces of a tea did I have to purchase and he responded most people either buy a full container or half a container; that did not answer my question, told him “no” and then told him I would take 2 oz of a White Ayurvedic Chai tea. He then pressed further, asking if I was certain I didn’t want two scoops of the tea, I responded by telling him I only wanted 1. He then again told me that most customers buy an entire canister of the tea so they don’t have to come back for more; once again this was a condescending remark. I told him, that was not a problem for me, and that I did not know if I even liked this tea and by buying one scoop I would thus sample it. He then questioned what I would do with the rest of the space in my canister at home, to which I told him I will be fine. He told me that if I liked the smell of the tea then I more than likely I would enjoy the taste and thus should buy a canister of the tea, “Really

He then turned to the next tea and said, that was it”, to which he then asked what I was going to do with my second canister at home? I told him it was still full with the other tea I owned. 

By this point I was rather insulted by the whole charade and felt like leaving the store. I then decided to state my thoughts as he started to process my purchase and told him, “Us pushy? Them’s fighting words” in a joking manner. A third employee stocking goods then looked up to our scenario and said, “The customer is always right”. This is when the main employee looked at me and then snidely said, “I didn’t know $11 was breaking the bank?”. I was then highly insulted and humiliated and looked at my cousin and told the employee, “We’re done here”. To which the employee responded, “Really?!! Fine.” and then poured the tea back into its container. 

This is a completely irresponsible way to treat your customers and because of it, but a dissatisfied customer tells about 10 – 20 people. I can only imagine how high that number goes when your employees insult them as well. 

Edit: Thanks for the support! I have also emailed them the link to this Reddit post. Hopefully they respond.

Edit 2: I received an email back from Teavana Customer Service

I responded to the email giving them my phone number. Any thoughts? How do you predict they will try to mend the scenario? What do you think they should do?

Update 1: I was called by the overseeing manager of the Great Lakes Region stores who was mortified of this story. The manager apologized profusely and said that this employee did not represent Teavana and was going to be reprimanded and the entire store retrained. My letter had made it all the way up to their corporate office as an issue. Due to my bad experience they've offered to send me a gift card in the mail in hope I will continue to visit their stores or buy their tea online. It would seem that we've made a difference. Thanks for the support and your comments.

Haryney and Sons in SoHo, and I noticed that the last time I went, they removed the leaves from the pot, which they didn't used to do. The first thing I always do when I get a pot of tea is remove the infuser so that it doesn't oversteep. I was wondering how I get a second infusion if they dump the leaves. Then I saw this this time. How do they justify $3 for hot water?? That is all it costs them to infuse a second time, hot water. I really like their tea, too, but I will not be going back or buying any more tea from them.

Hello! I'm from Argentina and i really enjoy tea

It caught my eye how many of you drink Mate

Some clarifications about stuff: I don't speak english as my mother tongue so you can expect weird grammar and spelling

So first things first:

Yerba mate is a tree. Not a tall one

The natives of this area, but they had to dried them first. Yerba mate is poisonous if not dried. Not poisonous that you will die, but you will wish to. It will give you stomach cramps, inflamation, diharrea, intestine cramps, incontinence and fever. The natives used to have a leather pouch that was really thin and was attached to their back so while walking in the jungle and under the sun yerba would be dried.

Nowadays we use a different method:

You have to know that making yerba is so cheap

Yerba grows naturally on the jungle or can be planted in order to be gathered. It's usually plantes in iron (and ferrites) rich soils and it grows really easy. 95% of the production of Yerba in the province of misiones is organic
The rach that we usually go is around 2000 acres (800 hectáreas) And has a lot of Tea ([1](http://i.imgur.com/z0ZtL.jpg) [2](http://i.imgur.com/Sbps6.jpg) [3](http://i.imgur.com/x8nSB.jpg)) , they process around 3 tons of yerba a day (3000kg, or around 6000 pounds).

First yerba is picked and trasported in [trucks](http://i.imgur.com/gAqnu.jpg) ([another pic](http://i.imgur.com/cF6Xe.jpg)) to the facility and [piled up](http://i.imgur.com/6sdTU.jpg).

After this is placed in some [transport belts](http://i.imgur.com/1Iahq.jpg) that will toss it inside of a [hughe tumbler](http://i.imgur.com/Of5FE.jpg) [pic 2](http://i.imgur.com/tqt6y.jpg) [pic 3 ](http://i.imgur.com/bjW8O.jpg) [pic 4](http://i.imgur.com/mgA9V.jpg). 

One end of the tumbler is a [Giant Oven](http://i.imgur.com/cxTBc.jpg) [oven 2](http://i.imgur.com/jOjNI.jpg) [oven 3](http://i.imgur.com/XkuZ4.jpg). To dry 1000kg of yerba (2000lbs) they burn around 2 square meters of [wood](http://i.imgur.com/zMPTP.jpg). 

It's really important that the wood is not pine or any wood that will burn with a smell because it will taint the Yerba itself.

The other end of the tumbler is another transport belt to the second oven that has 60 to 80% the temperature from the first one. After this 2nd oven

[Canchadora](http://i.imgur.com/8d3sU.jpg) is a machine that will separate the [stick from the leaves](http://i.imgur.com/qynT3.jpg) (that's one of the peons from the ranch, because you can have ""yerba con palo"" (with sticks) or ""yerba sin palo"" (without sticks). The main difference is in the intensity of the flavour. In 1kg (2lbs) of yerba con palo, you have a certain amount of leaves and a certain amount of leaves. If you have the same volume of yerba but without the palos, there will be an increase on the volume of leaves in comparision son the flavour will be much intense.

By this time

Then they bag the yerba in 50kg (100lbs) [bags](http://i.imgur.com/NrRYB.jpg). Each bag is left in storage for at least one year. This process is called ""estacionamiento"" (literally translates to parking

The market price of one of the white bags (the 50kg ones) is around 40 pesos (10 us dollars).


Once you have you yerba
There's mainly 2 ways of drinking
Mate cocido is the yerba in a bag

My grandma used to put one bag in boiling milk, warms my body and my soul.

The other way is getting a mate (the weird gourd like argentinean water bong thingy).
There is a GORILLION mates. You have wooden, stainless steel, bamboo, dried gourd, aluminium, porcelain, and a big list of etc's.

Then you need a bombilla (straw). it's really important that no matter what material the straw is

You fill 3/4 parts of the mate with the yerba and you put 95°C water (2003F). If you put boiling water you'll burn the yerba and the mate will be blend very fast. When the yerba starts to float, my mom puts artificial sweetener on the thermus and i want to bludgeon her with it.

Everyone drinks mate all day here. It's one of the few things that goes across all classes and sectors of our society. Even though you don't drink

**Bonus:** Mate myths and traditions.

""Un mate no se le niega a nadie"". If somebody asks you for a mate

""Mate corto"". Is when you pour little watter on the mate. The other person doesn't what you to leave their house

to make them last longer. My grandma says ""corto como beso de marido"" that translates to ""Short as a husband kiss"" in oposition to a lover's 

or boyfriend.

""Mate Largo""

If i can remember more i'll put the here.

**TL;DR:** i'm green inside.

PS: i promise to take pictures of mates

My dad owns 2 tea factories in the low country of Sri Lanka (Ill get into this in a sec). One of them is a very small factory that still uses the old British era machines (which are incredible) and another is a medium sized fairly modern factory. Also were shareholders of a large factory.

We dont sell our tea directly to the consumer. Instead

There are two main classifications of tea made in Sri Lanka, but not so popular in the UK. 


I can write a step by step process of how black tea is made (with
I hope Im not breaking any rules by posting this here and not IAMA.

**Edit**: Gah! Wall of text
Ask away!

**Edit 2**: Ok sorry about the delay

I dont have any proper pictures of the machines

Ok so once the Green leaf reaches the factory

this is the rear side of the dryer

Next is my favourite part
The tea is then put through a chute directly into a machine called the roller. A roller is like those teapot rides that go around in circles (but its one giant teapot and they're very small rotations). IMO one of the most dangerous machines in the factory. 
http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4049/4716221799_5777bd5e8c.jpg a picture of an old roller (from google)

The tea is put through several cycles of rollers until theyre ready to be ferment in a very damp room.
Once fermented
You get 4 general sizes. In order of increasing: 1st Dhool
After this

After this they go through several large cheese grater like machines that separate according to size
This is a rather elegant machine (the one in the back). Tea goes to the top of the machine and gets blown by wind to the other end of the machine. It separates the tea according to weight
After all that separations is done
And they get 'liquored' :D
Heres the album with the few stuff I could get. Ill try get hold of the older factories stuff. The last time I was there I was taking pictures with film (damn uni!)

First


Background information on me - I have been living in China for what is inching closer and closer to a decade, that if I wouldn't drink it, I won't stock it. The company is called [White 2 Tea](http://www.white2tea.com) , check it out, and please post feedback! I will try to answer any questions as best I can.


Also, so here are some hopefully meaningful validations of my puer street cred. Reviews on some puer blogs like [Hobbes](http://half-dipper.blogspot.co.uk/2012/10/2007-menghai-fuyuan-yexiangwang.html) and [Jakub](http://jakubtomek.blogspot.co.uk/2012/10/2011-taochaju-banna-gu-yun.html) . And, if you are so inclined, I blog about puer/tea at [twodogteablog](http://www.twodogteablog.com) .


Hope you enjoy the Thanksgiving holiday or the weekend

And one other thing, and are ordered before midnight on Sunday Nov 25th will get a free 2012 Dayi Hongyun 100g cake. It's a good little shu cake, that looks like [this.](http://imgur.com/a/H6Uda)

**tl;dr** I started [this site](http://www.white2tea.com) selling puer direct from China. I love reddit. I will give you a [100g shu cake](http://imgur.com/a/H6Uda) from Menghai if you order over 50 bucks of tea before Sunday.

Also tried were chai and rum, Earl Grey and scotch (The United Kingdom), Roasted Chestnut tea with Crown Royal Maple, white wine mulled with our local tea store's spiced tea blend (black tea, cinnamon, cloves, some other stuff), Lipton with Two Gingers whiskey - but fear not

We also just tried some of the random teas we picked up before the party from the previously mentioned local tea store. My new favorite being a cherry green tea. 

Then we played Cards Against Humanity and laughed until it hurt.

Thanks a lot for all of your recommendations. I'd have to say that all of the drinks maintained their tea flavor rather well. Everything was just brewed normally

If you guys are interested, and the rest of us who already love tea found even more flavors/blends we like with or without alcohol.

1354510592.0,146ot4,How my love for coffee led me to switch to tea,Beelzebubba,102,29,29,"It all started sometime around 1985, a coffee and tea shop, and it brings me back to the flavor of that first cup in 1985

Howell was selling Sumtatran coffee, and Costa Rican, and on and on and on.  In the land of Dunkin Donuts, this was revolutionary to my adolescent taste buds.  The tea was good too, but the coffee - I was hooked.  

Years went by, I learned to buy my coffee from Peet’s, which had opened down the street, or from the 1369 Coffeehouse in Central Square, which had really excellent stuff.  I mostly drank my coffee at home, brewed in a French press.  I was a big fan of Sumatran, eventually discovered Indian coffee from Mysore, except a little more so.  

One day, and Monsooned Malabar, and funky aged Java, and delicate, almost sweet Panamanian and Costa Rican coffees.  Heaven.  

Alas, and I would have to (gasp) buy coffee.  Also, my wife’s tastes, and those of her parents (who frequently stayed with us for long stretches in those days) ran towards filter-brewed Melitta coffee.  So began the dark years.  

Some time passed, the pot she had made would have gone cold, and I would need to microwave it.  If I took it with me in a to-go cup, it would invariably be lukewarm for my drive to work.  This was madness.  I hatched a plan.  

I bought a new French press.  My old one had disappeared at some point, and too big for my intended purpose.  I plugged in my trusty coffee roaster, and roasted up some nice Sumatran to a good “full city” roast.  A couple days later, after letting the coffee “gas off”, I was ready to have a cup.  It was perfect.  Best coffee I’d had in years.  

So, and I had to disable a smoke alarm, but I was drinking real, delicious coffee again.  Pure happiness.

Still, maybe it was time for me to buy a good quality burr grinder.  Something with a timer to allow me to measure my dose accurately.  Then one day, I didn’t have any coffee ready to brew.  That night, I went to one of my favorite shops and bought some Sumatran.  On a whim, I decided to buy a little loose tea as well - why not, that works well in a French press, and I haven’t had a nice cup of tea in a while.  

Well, even in another shop.  

After I ran out of that bag of coffee, nothing mind-blowing.  But the convenience was refreshing.  

I went to Cardullo’s in Harvard Square

Then I discovered Upton Tea.  Right in my own home state of Massachusetts, and a few others.  My order arrived the very next day.  I was pleasantly shocked.

Fast forward a little further, all of which I’m enjoying greatly.  Compared to coffee, tea is more convenient, lasts longer, easier to measure, doesn’t leave a nasty taste in my mouth when I’m done drinking it, encompasses a broader range of styles and flavor

TLDR; good coffee is a fucking pain in the ass,False,self,t5_2qq5e,False,,,t3_146ot4

So, ordering it, having a knowledge base, and coming up with a monthly ""Special-Tea"" drink.

The problem that I've already run into is my limited creativity with the special drinks. I've been doing a lot of iced stuff since it's nice and hot outside, but I'm running out of ideas fast, and was wondering if you guys had any particularly interesting drinks up your sleeve.

I should probably say that my iced tea choices are somewhat limited, pomegranate green tea, gunpowder, hibiscus herbal, and a mint/citrus herbal. As for what I can mix, I've got the whole coffeeshop's inventory at my disposal, so lemonade, flavored syrups

Any ideas would be greatly appreciated. :&gt;",self,t5_2qq5e,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/tea/comments/x7urs/tea_cocktails/

Edit 2: I saw someone post a question about AliSan, and their meanings, but I can't find it so I'll answer it here.

AliSan and LiSan are mountains; they are the two most famous tea producing region in Taiwan.  

Dong Ding is also a tea producing region

Oriental Beauty is a style of tea making with a really cool story behind it.  Way back in the 19th century (maybe even earlier!) Taiwanese tea farmers noticed that their summer crops would be ravaged by the tea jassid

When British tea merchants noticed the Taiwanese farmers holding onto this product, the Taiwanese farmers threw out some ridiculously high number thinking the British would balk at the price.  But the British bought tons of it!  And brought it back to Queen Elizabeth II, saying it was the best tea, they've ever had.  

So Oriental Beauty is also called ""Braggarts tea"" named for the Taiwanese farmers who boasted they could turn trash into fortunes.",self,t5_2qq5e,1341558860.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/tea/comments/ofzby/hey_rtea_my_family_has_3_tea_estates_around_the/

[HERE](http://www2.hcmuaf.edu.vn/data/lhquang/file/Tea1/Tea%20preparation%20and%20its%20influence%20on%20methylxanthine.pdf) is the study that debunks the urban legend.
Share it around the next time it pops up.  


If that's a bit TL;DR

To be ""decaffeinated
Instead

30 seconds: -9% caffeine

1 minute: -18%

2 minutes: -34%

3 minutes: -48%

4 minutes: -60%

5 minutes: -69%

10 minutes: -92%

15 minutes: -100%


CONCLUSION: If you want to decaffeinate your tea
1) Brew for 8-10 minutes.  Throw out the brew.  Resteep to taste.  OR
2) Drink an herbal that doesn't have any caffeine.  That includes chocolate.

* Gyokuro and Sencha tea leaves
* One 15$ coffee mate coffee grinder
* An infusor basket repurposed as a sifter
* A lack of common sense

**The Procedure**

Simple: Add two teaspoons of tea to the grinder

**The Results**

I actually produced two distinct powders. One was neon green and had the fine

The second powder tended to collect on the bottom. It was dark green, caked to the bottom.

I'm not sure if these two powders come from different parts of the leaf (IE

**The Drink**

Dark green, fine powder from the coarse/dark powder seems to yield a better drink, but it's remarkably tedious to do so. I settle for a mix of the two.

**Conclusion**

Delicious to a confidence of 3-sigma. Makes a great 'matcha' latte, profit. Sweeten to taste if you do not care about dishonoring your family. 

**Complications**

It takes several minutes to grind tea to a fine powder. The tea particles don't come out of the grinder easily

The darker

The finer particles get airborn and will dust your counter in green. The upside is it smells amazing.

    Coffee is too neurotic.

    Wine and beer too nostalgic.

    Tea just is.

    It takes nothing from you

    Everything in its simplest form.

    Of up and down

    Of right and left

And of course

Now as for vendors...

[Bana Tea Company](http://banateacompany.com/) is a company run by Linda Louie

[Yunnan Sourcing](http://www.yunnansourcing.com/store/) likely needs no introduction

1366047706.0,1cegdr,An unusual Yixing-style pot with no top opening - has anyone seen one of these before.,EarnestWilde,51,3,19,"This past weekend I picked up [this odd Yixing-style pot](http://imgur.com/a/qiSRD) at an auction.  At first glance it looked like a low-end mud-clay decoration.  The top has no lid after all.  It appeared to just be a pot-shaped lump of clay.  Turning it over it had a big gaping hole on the bottom.  ""Yup

The auction catalog described it as a bottom-loading Yixing pot.  This was obviously preposterous as there is no room for leaf -- if you look in the hole in the bottom all you see is a narrow tube of clay.  I nearly dismissed it entirely.

Now I've heard of several pot makers who create Yixing pots with a hole on the bottom

Then as I was waiting through the first items of the auction it occurred to me:  what if the tube on the bottom was like a siphon, flip the pot over quickly, and voila!  The tea would stay inside until you were ready to pour.

I bought it on a whim and took it home to try it out.  Sure enough it works exactly as I hypothesized!  It even holds more tea than I expected.  I thought you would only be able to fill it halfway before it would spill out the tube again

Obviously the key problem with this design is ensuring the inside is clean and does not become moldy.  I'm going to pour a number of boiling pots of water through it before use

1355235641.0,14nyiq,Cream Earl Grey Review,Calcipher,52,2,25,"Let me start by saying three thing:

1. I'm going to structure my reviews in a similar fashion to those from /r/Scotch.  I like that style of review and I hope to start a trend towards them here.

2. I am not affiliated with New Mexico Tea company

3. I don't have a decent camera

All that said

**[Cream Earl Grey](https://www.nmteaco.com/Cream-Earl-Grey_p_137.html)**

* Ingredients: Black tea, and natural flavors

* Dry scent: A non-artificial vanilla is the primary scent with mild citrus undertones.  It is hard to describe the difference between artificial and natural vanilla scents in any other way than natural vanilla smells far less harsh than even vanilla extract.

* My brewing method: 1 tsp. of tea was added to my [FORLIFE tea infuser](http://www.forlifedesign.com/shop/index.php?main_page=index&amp;cPath=12_9) in a sixteen ounce mug.  Boiling (212 deg.) water was added and the tea was left to brew for five minutes with occasional agitation.  I drink all my tea 'black'

* Colour: A dark amber bordering on brown.  (I generally don't comment of the colour of the dry leaves themselves

* Nose: As with the dry tea

* Body: A full bodied tea with medium-high astringency.  The 'creaminess' of the tea is very noticeable as it coats your mouth much like a tea with a bit of cream would.  If I didn't know better

* Palate: Vanilla

* Finish: Citrus dominates the finish.  Surprisingly only a little black tea flavor lingers on the tongue.

* Summary: This tea is a must try for people who like sweet and creamy teas, bergamot.  That said, Cream Earl Grey is very pleasant, easy to drink, and is something that I get a craving for from time to time.  It would have been easy for this tea to taste medicinal had the balance between citrus and vanilla (or, god forbid, fake vanilla) been even slightly off

* Pass or buy: Buy
