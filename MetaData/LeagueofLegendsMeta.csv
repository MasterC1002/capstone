I am maining Fizz almost half and year, i ask myself: what should i build to win my lane? to win the game? And today i suddenly decided to make some calculations of Fizz's total magical damage from specific combo with various core builds. So, let's begin...

Calculations doesn't count physical damage, ""specific"" combo is considered R-&gt;W-&gt;Q-&gt;AA-&gt;E-&gt;AA + 2 Lichbane Procs (1st on Q, 2nd on AA after E) + 6 Sec of W DoT (3 - for applying combo, 3 - after you disengage from your target). I listed 6 core builds, and each have Lichbane at start, cause i think everybody will agree with me, that Lichbane for Fizz is a mandatory. You may not build Lichbane first (if you max W 1st, and buy Deathcap as 1st big item

**Fizz's Skills/Lichbane base damage + AP ratios:**

* Lichbane: 50 + 75% AP

* 7. 100 * 0.92 * 0.65 - 5.5 = 54 MR or 65% Magical Damage *taken* or **[2014 DMG for 7620 Gold]**

**Conclusions i made:**

* 1. Never build DFG, which have the lowest total damage among all 6 builds. DFG worth it, when you are behind and don't have enough damage to carry your team, but with DFG you can assasinate some valuable enemy target like ADC or APC.
* 2. If you are ahead and don't need any armor/mr that much
* 3. If you are having problems with physical damage at laning phase (heavy AD mid/top), also it gives you 45 extra MR, that may be useful later in teamfights. And also you can anytime upgrade your Boots to Sorc for 775 gold and get extra MPen or upgrade them earlier to Tabi for extra Armor in laning phase.
* 4. If you are having problems with magical damage at laning phase (heavy AP mid/top) or just don't want to risk going reckless for Deathcap, and also allows you to upgrade your Boots to Sorc for extra MPen or to Merc for extra MR + Tenacity anytime you want. And also dat Needlessly Large Rod is core item for Deathcap/Zhonya's/DFG, so overall i would call 5th core build as a very flexible golden mean.
* 5. Sorc.Boots and Tier-2.Boots overall aren't mandatory anymore

**TL;DR:** Begone

**Update:** Added 7th core build with Tier-1.Boots/Lichbane/Void.Staff/Needlessly.Rod/Doran's. According to ""Shooting Range""

I'd recommend going for Void Staff, enemy team certanly will be trolling, stacking MR against you :D). IMO, better way get Void Staff is go this way: Doran's Ring -&gt; Tier-1.Boots -&gt; Lichbane -&gt; Deathcap -&gt; Void Staff -&gt; Sorc.Boots

1348851700.0,10mjww,Why do you try to play 1200 elo like a tournament?,awjustaguy,139,20,41,"Let's go ahead and get this out of the way: I think EVERYONE believes that they are a bit better than their elo. As such

Here's my thought though: Playing like a high-elo player is not always the right choice. Let me give you a personal example first

I've always considered myself a decent player. Who hasn't? I always felt 'stuck' at around 1100-1300 elo and I always felt 'better' than my team. Eventually

What happened? As I considered it, 1200 elo is a different ball-game; the strategies and team mechanics are very different than 1400. I wouldn't ward often because I expected the support and jungler to pick up ward slack. I would make harmful trades to bait a jungle gank that never came from my jungler. I would push cautiously wary of a gank top when all of a sudden there were five bot.

When I got to around 1350 elo

So here are my final thoughts: Playing beyond your ELO is a bad move. Expecting your teammates and enemies to be 2300 players is just as bad for your game as not warding and pushing hard. The first step to conquering your ELO is understanding the mindset of your elo. With the knowledge that I have now

1370036181.0,1ffgv4,A Game of Pressure: This isn't Call of Duty,BlueNoseReindeer,137,22,13,"Hi guys

A common mistake that I see even as a Platinum player is the inability to create genuine pressure (let's say that pressure is defined as your ability to control your opponent). To win League you need to kill the enemy team's nexus, you must ""pressure"" them away from them.

With that being said, but not always. 

If you have pressure, kill dragon/baron, get inhibs, etc. because they can't stop you for whatever reason. Now, let's take a look at what some of those reasons are.

* Raw Power. Draven-Leona is the most powerful starting bot lane I can think of, push towers, etc. They don't necessarily need to get kills to be effective, the threat of being able to kill is good enough. In a straight up fight with no turrets and equal minion damage, Draven-Leona will beat everything. Beating a Draven-Leona combo requires poking/kiting, lowering the amount of power they have to the point where they CAN be beaten in a fight (for more on team comps read [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/1fa711/composition_analysis_next_level_solo_queing/).  Always remember (particularly at earlier stages of the game) that minion damage is factored into raw power, both in the jungle and the lane. A team with more raw power that maneuvers effectively (which is the trick) can safe take towers, and Barons, level

* Wards. Wards create pressure if you use them correctly. Leona has bush control? Put a ward in (not next to her or she'll kill it) and for 3 minutes that bush is as much yours as hers. But then she pinks it, *controlling where you go*, AKA creating pressure. Vision gives knowledge, and knowledge is power. Remember last paragraph When I talked about maneuvering properly? Wards allow you to do that by seeing what your enemy is doing, and what you need to do in response. More commonly, wards serve as anti-pressure, denying the enemy's ability to control you

* Minion waves. Minions waves are a big part of why split pushers are viable in LoL. Take Singed for example, he is able to splitpush, creating pressure. Because of this pressure the enemy goes to react, and will usually try to fight him, resulting in a chase, which is the only reason he can pick up kills. If Singed is able to draw more than one person to him, the rest of his team has a clear advantage, then moving to the opposite side of the map and pushing there has a similar effect. The enemy team must either send someone to deal with this wave and seriously risk losing a tower

* Cooldowns. Cooldowns are essential to determining real Raw Power, such as Shen and Karthus ults) is so important. If you are able to force/bait out an ultimate, your engage will be stronger than theirs, and you should use this to your advantage.
tl;dr Cooldowns of abilities are factors people overlook more than just about anything else. Take this into account when determining Raw Power to make a play.

* Jungler. Jungle pressure is something you probably hear a lot about, and will almost always result in more Raw power for the ganker, which can result in kills or forcing someone out of lane. This type of pressure is designed to ""snowball"" a lane. What that means is that if the gank is successful, their is still work left to be done. After being given an advantage, the laner should (at least temporarily) have more Raw Power, and be able to create pressure for the team in their lane by 1: drawing enemy jungle pressure (and not falling to it) so that they cannot make plays on other lanes 2: taking the tower to give global gold/exp and increased roaming opportunities so that you can pressure other lanes 3: deny farm in order to reduce the amount of Raw Power that the enemy will have.

* Kills. Kills are a great way to set yourself ahead, and missing the experience from a couple waves may give the opportunity for the enemy to have more Raw Power than the longsword/amp tome that you just bought gave you. It's very important to distinguish between lategame kills, and early game kills. Early game kills can lead to snowballing, but if they don't, are relatively insignificant. Late game kills can lead to losing objectives, but if they don't, are similarly insignificant. As such, you are looking to get yourself ahead and/or set the enemy back because this is how you create pressure. If you get kills after the laning phase

* Most Net Pressure. As several of the previous paragraphs (the last one in particular) have alluded to

(I'm sure I'm not including everything

League is an objective-oriented game, and applying pressure to objectives as best you can given those compositions (i.e. grouping as an AOE comp, splitpushing as a splitpush comp, etc.) is how you win games.

So I set out to do some math. I decided that the best way to solve this was the calculate the damage per health of the two rock beasts. Much like team fighting

I will calculate the damage/health based on the golem's stats between 3:00 and 3:59. Since the armor and magic resistance of the two are the same (buff camps are an exception)

Big Golem: 

Health= 1200 + 48(3) = 1344

Damage= 54 + 1.6(3) = 58.8

Damage/Health= **0.04375**

Lesser Golem: 

Health= 300 + 37(3) = 411

Damage= 30 + 1.3(3) = 33.9

Damage/Health= **0.08248**

The Lesser Golem's Damage/Health ratio is 89% higher than that of the Big Golem

1363202358.0,1a8ex5,"Top lane AP/CDR Skarner guide for Skarner fans disappointed by his S3 jungle, those looking to fill the void AP Tryn left, and anyone who appreciates unconventional picks",GANGBANGARANG,113,40

[8 games

I had a lot of fun with AP Tryn during his brief reign as the king of top lane, and all of his abilities reduce on hit AND have their own AP ratios.

**PROS TO AP SKARNER**:  

Obscene waveclear  
Godlike sustained damage  
A heal and a shield that both scale with AP  
Dat incredible ult with the added bonus of a 1.0 ratio and a ridiculously low effective cooldown(even after the nerf it's still a gamechanger)  
Melts turrets
Permaslow from lvl 1--extremely hard to disengage from and very easy to gank for (especially after 6)  
Stupidly high scaling into midgame and beyond  
Throws off enemy counterpicks in draft due to being unconventional  
You **will** catch most players completely off guard with the amount of damage and sustain you can throw around  
Incredibly fun to play!

**CONS TO AP SKARNER:**  

Squishy and easy to burst in teamfight situations--therefore not a reliable initiator the way tank Skarner is  
No gap closer, has a very hard time with some ranged lanes  
Takes a long time to recover from a slow start  
Fairly easy to gank
Can be zoned from utilizing his heal in lane and teamfights  
Naturally pushes lane with harass
Desperately mana-hungry  
May break your QWE keys from intensive button mashing

**MASTERIES:**

AP SKAR should be my active mastery page [on my lolking](http://www.lolking.net/summoner/na/151476#masteries). 21/0/9 modified AP page. I'm not particularly confident in this page the way I usually am when it comes to masteries; arguments could be made for taking Havoc (%dmg) or Deadliness/Weapons Expertise (ad/lvl and %arpen) instead of fury (aspd) due to its low budget. Even though you can certainly utilize the aspd

**RUNES**:

Hybrid Penetration Reds/Armor Yellows/MR Blues/AP Quints

If you do not own hybrid pen reds (because let's face it, consider magic pen (generic AP page) or aspd. I haven't tried these so I can't vouch for how they feel. Because of the hybrid ratio on Q and how much autoattacking you do, hybrid pen is pretty much always going to be the best choice for raw damage output.

**SUMMONERS:**

Flash is, I'd consider taking barrier (or in rare cases, cleanse) if you're against a heavy ganking jungler or lane bully that's going to try to all-in for a kill on you early themselves (Elise and Jayce are pretty much nightmares for AP Skarner). Exhaust is redundant; you already have a permaslow and a suppress. Ghost certainly could be useful but it would be situational against extremely high mobility teams.

**ABILITIES:**

Q should pretty much always be your starting spell. You can steal wraiths with it at level 1 or put significant damage out for your jungler or wait in the top lane bush (when you're on purple side) to catch the other laner if they helped with blue buff--as long as they aren't strong enough to turn it around on you lvl 1. You're pretty weak relative to the top lane paradigm early on so don't try to catch out a GP or Kayle and expect things to go well for you.

I generally go QEQW to harass my opponent in lane and slowly try to shove him under tower with the damage from Q and E

After that

**ITEMS:**

I start **flask/3pots** or **flask/pot/ward** almost every game. His heal is quite weak early and being a short ranged fighter, I really like flask because it rounds out Skarner's early weaknesses well--he's only strong if you're going all-in and autoattacking, but you need lots of HP and mana to keep that up. By going hard early and chugging flask to keep yourself on top, you should be able to get an advantage or at least survive long enough for your first major purchase. If you aren't a fan of flask, you can try a 9pot/2ward setup with mixed HP and mana pots, or boots/3 against champions that might be difficult to get in range against.

**Tear of the Goddess** is my first core item that I build every single game. Skarner's Q was -made- for charging tear, and a base CD of 3.5 seconds. Spam Q in the fountain and on the way to lane and you'll find that you can charge your tear easily before 20 minutes as long as you bought it reasonably early. Skarner's a huge black hole of mana if you spam indiscriminately (which is half the fun of AP skarner, let's be honest) but I find that a rushed tear and flask are all I need to manage my mana throughout the entire game. Later, you're going to be turning this into **Archangel's Staff/Seraph's Embrace**, giving you a boatload of cost-efficient AP and a very powerful shield active that helps counteract your squishiness and pull off ridiculous low-hp sustain baits (you can use WE in the middle of a fight for a shield and heal, pop Seraph's for a second shield, and by the time it's down your shield will be back up and you can have healed twice).

Now for the part the AP Tryn fans have been waiting for: With your mana issues settled for the measly price of 1045g, or just a codex if I'm short of that too. The daggers into Stinger into Nashor's come last.

Once you hit that magic 39% CDR, and then using the AP for more damage, bigger shields, and gobs of sustain.

At this point, you should upgrade it to Archangel's/Seraph's posthaste (which I already talked about above). That 2000g nets you upwards of 120 AP, some mp5, and an awesome active, all without wasting an item slot. There are three other items I'll sometimes consider after CDR boots/Nashor's as well, those being **Seeker's Armguard, Twin Shadows, CDR, but I'll sometimes pick it up beforehand if I need the power boost (particularly in regards to split pushing) and I only have enough for blasting wand

At some point

The last big item I tend to be able to build is **Sheen &gt; Lichbane**. With Nashor's and AA you should go over 200 AP; after Lichbane you'll break 300 for ~275 magic dmg on hit on a 2-second cooldown which is exceedingly easy to trigger with the sheer spammability of your spells. In fact, every single time it's up, without needing a target or anything. Add that on top of your blazingly fast attack speed and it's clear why AP Skarner is capable of demolition on an industrial scale.

Items to consider after Lichbane should include defensive choices such as **Guardian Angel, tanky AP items like **Zhonya's Hourglass, Abyssal Scepter, and Liandry's Torment** (Liandry's is actually really great on AP Skarner--you have an AoE spell with a built-in permaslow, and the burn damage will instantly pop your E's heal on targets hit without requiring you to get in range and auto or Q them--plus you aren't getting spell pen on your boots so it fills that need well--the problem is fitting it in your main build), and raw damage items including **Rabadon's Deathcap, Void Staff, replace your CDR boots with Sorc Shoes

**CONCLUSION**

That's my AP Skarner in a nutshell. I'm not going to claim that he's competitively viable based on a few low-platinum ranked games and a handful of normals

Oh

1. Try to impress upon your jungler the ease of ganking for Skarner and the importance of getting him off to a good start in order to get him snowballing. Typically all it takes is one kill for me to irrevocably win the lane no matter how much they try to camp me and bring me back down to size. Let him know every time your ult's up post-6

2. Mana management is a big deal for AP Skar! Even with tear and flask, I can count on one hand the times I've run oom past 25 minutes or so into the game and most of those are because I was facerolling all my abilities on cooldown while autoattacking baron. Speaking of which, AP Skar is really good at doing baron! Good sustained damage and a heal and shield + a stationary target for constant auto CDR mean you make a pretty damn good tank (despite having built nothing tanky whatsoever)--and because most of your damage is coming from AP, Baron's AD debuff doesn't significantly impact your dps, meaning you can tank for someone like Vi or Xin for whom that debuff really matters.

For those of you that don't know

The best case scenario for this mastery is heavily stacking a single resistance. Take Maokai stacking armor as an example:

* 13 - Yellow Runes
* 5 - Defense Tree
* 95 - Frozen Heart
* 70 - Randuin's Omen
* 45 - Sunfire Cape
* 25 - Ninja Tabi
* 30 - Bulwark

This gives him bonus armor of 283

(Raw Damage by Opponent)*(Damage multiplier before cloth armor-Damage multiplier with cloth armor)

We are using armor yellows/quints and a level 1 riven. So in Wickd's example:

**500(0.6965-0.6306)=32.95 physical damage reduced.**

For his statement to be correct you would need a difference of damage multipliers to be 0.12 (calculated by dividing 60 by 500).

So

So Wickd

Meta-wise, early armor is the best armor. The question is whether early armor or early HP regen is best.

Armor:

+Doesn't fall off late game (gains effectiveness with increased damage taken and HP increases from leveling)

+increases effectiveness of heals and shields

-less sustain than HP sustain at early levels

HP regen:

+better HP sustain as long as you don't get hit an extreme amount (like early game)

-falls off late game (increases in damage taken and increases in your health and ending of laning phase)

-worth nothing if you get bursted

TL;DR So for early defenses HP regen definitely seems a viable alternative to King armor

1358732934.0,16ynp4,FYI: Voidstaff deals more damage to targets with greater than 70-80MR,shriek56,87,8,59,"TL;DR : On almost every AP champion

**First Calculation:**

REFERENCE FOR HOW TO CALCULATE: [Link](http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/Magic_penetration)

I had a discussion in the main subreddit about whether Voidstaff or Deathcap was better with ~75mr and someone suggested I posted the calculations here

Full burst combo: 230(.6) + 160(.7) + 70(.4) + 675(1)

Simpler Form: 1135(2.7)

100AP from runes/masteries/dorans or whatever

Deathcap ((100 + 120) * 1.25 = 275 AP)

Voidstaff (170AP) + 35% pen

DC Pre Resistances : 1135 + (2.7 * 275) = 1887.5

VS Pre Resistances : 1135 + (2.7 * 170) = 1594

DC Damage With 80MR : 1887.5 * (100/(100 + 80)) = 1048.61

VS Reduction with 80MR: 80 * .65 = 52

VS Damage with 80MR: 1594 * (100/(100 + 52)) = 1048.68

**Scaling with Flat Penetration:**

As you'll see with these calculations

DC Damage With 80MR : 1887.5 * (100/(100 + 80 - 15)) = 1143.93

VS Damage with 80MR: 1594 * (100/(100 + 52 - 15) = 1163.50

**Scaling With Other Types of Penetration:**

Unsurprisingly, or additional % penetration will reduce the benefit of void staff compared to deathcap. I used the 8% pen from masteries and left sorc shoes in, just to show how getting some flat pen (which is pretty common anyways) usually offsets any potential loss from other pen types.

DC Damage With 80MR : 1887.5 * (100/(100 + 73.6 - 15)) = 1190.10

VS Damage with 80MR: 1594 * (100/(100 + (47.84 - 15)) = 1199.93

**SCALING WITH ADDITIONAL AP:**

This is a very important section to note. It is a common misconception that Deathcap will scale better as you acquire more AP items. THIS IS FALSE. Void Staff will scale better than Deathcap per AP you acquire.

200AP

Deathcap (384AP)

Voidstaff (270AP)

DC Pre Resistances : 1135 + (2.7 * 384)= 2171.8

VS Pre Resistances : 1135 + (2.7 * 270)= 1864

DC Damage With 80MR : 2171.8 * (100/(100 + 73.6 - 15)) = 1369.36

VS Damage with 80MR: 1864 * (100/(100 + (47.84 - 15)) = 1403.19

**Scaling with enemy resistances:**

As the enemies gain more resistances, the target has 100 mr.

DC Damage With 80MR : 2171.8 * (100/(100 + 92 - 15)) = 1227

VS Damage with 80MR: 1864 * (100/(100 + (59.8 - 15)) = 1287.29

**Conclusions:**

As you see, AP, and enemy resistances. It is also 1000g cheaper to build than Deathcap.

It isn't too hard to have an enemy get to 80mr either. Base stats, Aegis/Bulwark, mr items, and defensive steroids will guarantee that 2/5-4/5 will be around 80mr come 20 minutes.

You can pretty much swap out Deathcap purchases with Voidstaff purchases. Champions with built in Flat Reduction, Amumu, Fiddles, if someone bought abyssal, etc) (**EDIT:** I did the math in a post below. This is definitely not true for Xerath (And probably any of the others). Get Void Staff first.). If you get really fed quickly and the enemy team hasn't bulked up yet, a deathcap first may still be a good idea.

1332435793.0,r8l40,Defining and changing the meta,OctilleryLOL,81,10,21,"Long read ahead on game theory revolving around meta-strategies

There are lots of complaints about the current ""meta"" and how it is becoming ""stagnant"" or is ""boring"" to play. The latter is subjective, the meta is constantly shifting. Maybe not all the way down the park bench, but repositioning itself such that it is comfortable. 

The current meta exists because it is an easy to use strategy that takes advantage of the inherent mechanics of the game. The meta will only change if another single setup is the top tier in terms of matchups. This cannot happen with just adding one champion

As of right now, but are good at escaping ganks. Therefore, they sit in the long lane at top, so that even if they push out a bit while farming (which occurs naturally), they can survive a gank if it comes. They don't need the accessibility of mid lane, and running a duo lane costs them far too many levels. While sitting at top lane, far away from the early game objective (dragon), so that they are durable enough (with gold) and strong enough (with levels) to have an impact on midgame.

Mages need levels in the early game to stay strong. One level for a mage is, for most mages, is ~60 AP) from the gold lost by not going bot lane for safer farm. If you're zoned out by mid camping, you're still gaining experience (hopefully), so you don't need to worry about that. The inability of many mages to escape ganks is nullified somewhat by the fact that mid lane is short, so you don't need to run very far; flash is an almost guaranteed out against some gankers, while most gankers are completely nullified by two wards on either side. The added benefit of mid lane is the accessibility of all map objectives and the other lanes. Therefore, it makes sense for your strongest early game character to be able to gank both side lanes

Since AD carries don't gain much damage off of levels, the ability of the support to deny enemy kills/harrass allows the ad to farm more gold than they would solo. Once the ad has damage, the damage is presented in a sustained and ranged form, so it is effective in all situations.

Now the reason I typed out all this information that people probably know is to provide an immediate reference for how the meta works. Once you understand how it works, but SUB-OPTIMAL. Since bottom lane is the most common complaint, I will use bottom lane specific examples for the remainder of this response. For example, if the only way to compete against to soraka kog is playing soraka kog, then the game is not balanced. In a deep, balanced game, every choice should have counters that is not itself. What we are looking for, is the strongest

However, a support ad combo is much more important to a team than a jarvan and leona combo, or a taric and brand combo. Unless the latter two create a large advantage by forgoing the ad carry, they will be in a poor position for the mid/late game tower sieges. It is because this combination of support and ad bottom lane is very optimal and strong that it is the most common thing people will run, which is therefore the ""meta.""

In every game, AND counters the current near-optimal meta setup, then the meta ""shifts"" to the new strategy. Otherwise, the strategy is simply a counter; a situationally employed strategy.

In bottom lane, jarvan leona is not going to do amazingly well against soraka cait, bringing the countering full circle, as they don't deny soraka cait farm. In all of this, player skill is still the most important, of course. However, the existence of these soft counters gives a slight advantage to the team that picks their champions wisely and in the correctly in response to their opponent's picks.

Therefore, AND be optimal in relation to the rest of the team. Such a thing is more likely to occur to the game in every lane simultaneously than in one lane at a time.

TL;DR, a different strategy must counter the current meta strategy AND be as optimal or more optimal in which case, it will naturally become the most popular strategy.

* 1. For starters, which is a large part of why League is such a great game. 

Morgana is a good example of this, her pool can clear waves quickly, and her peeling abilities also serve well as escape mechanisms making her a good splitpusher, her ult is a powerful AOE ability, and her ult's ability to function excellently with Zhonya's make her one of the best diving carries in the game. 

However, two people can play Morgana very differently (passive vs. aggressive, etc.), including having different builds, and both of them be maximizing her potential.

 Even if someone is not maximizing potential fully (perhaps they got Tear of the Goddess on Morg for some reason) if it is what they are used to it is what they will do best with for now. If they are a friend you may want to tell them there are better options, **Solo Queue is for you to improve yourself, not your team.**

* 2. Okay, we simply choose which combination of tools we like in a champion when we choose them. This means we trade off some tools for others, and understanding the ramifications of that choice allow us to better utilize it.

For an example, he is very popular as a jungler right now. Consume can be very helpful in counterjungling (particularly with the recent buffs it received, while it loses some effectiveness in teamfights and dueling, even if you are able to to find minions to use it on to get the heal. 

A similar ability to Nunu's Consume is Cho'Gath's [Feast] (http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/Cho%27Gath). Because of the cooldown on Feast, it is not as potent in counterjungling as Consume is. However, the feast stacks, if they are able to be built up, are more useful once a teamfight starts, and the fact that it can be used on enemy champions also makes it a much better ability for teamfighting. So, while Consume has more use as a counterjungling tool

Because of this (Ignoring all other abilities for the sake of simplicity)

Assuming this is true, they are carefully set up.**

Let's look at a this concept in a different context. Take a support like Sona, ranged autoattacks, and pokey abilities are designed to be used to gradually harass/out-trade the opponent out of lane, while a support with hard engage, lots of cc, and some form of anti-burst (usually a shield) such as Leona, Blitzcrank, the poker wants to be forcing opportunities to harass (usually by pushing a minion wave), or otherwise get into a place where a fight can be forced.

Both types of supports have an equal chance at winning, exactly who will win will be largely determined by who pushes the strengths of their kit, while defending the weaknesses of it. **If a large part of your kit is poke, you should probably be poking, if a very small part of your kit is poking, you probably shouldn't be poking.**

* **Mundo :**   His cleaver is more of a poking tool and he needs a finisher to be really effective.
 
* **Elise :**  She has poking and a finisher with only her Q. That makes her a great counter to the current meta. Sadly

* **Evelynn :**  Her ultimate is a wonderful initiation ability

* **Garen :**  His ultimate can pretty much Kill anyone that is low on health. But it has quite a long CD and you still need the initial damage on you target.

* **Jayce :**  His E deals %HP in magic damages but scales with AD. You need to get some MPen if you want this ability to really be effective against tanky target

* **Kha'zix :**  His evolved Q does 12% of the target missing health if isolated

* **Kog'maw :**  Kog'maw ability to melt tanky target is great. He probably is one of the AD carry that is the least bothered by this meta. But he needs protection because he has no escape and is very squishy.

* **Lee sin :**  While his Q isn't the best finisher out there

* **Malzahar :**  His W last for 5 second and deals %HP every second. This can be huge if you are able to force the enemy team to stand in it with some CC.

* **Poppy :**  The %HP damage she has on her Q can't exceed a certain number and you need to hit the enemy a lot with it to manage to kill him.

* **Varus :**  His magic damage when using blight can help him a lot when fighting tanky target but as every ADC in this list

* **Vayne :**  Vayne late game is a scary thing

* **Vi :**  Vi does a lot of %HP in physical damage. She needs some armor pen and stick to her target to actually use it well which can be a bit tricky.

* **Xin Zhao :**  His ult is an initiation tool that deals 15% of the enemy current health

*  **Zed :**  His passive allows him to deal %HP in magic damage to injured target. This can be great to finish off tanky target that aren't in a good shape.

1373418846.0,1hz5ao,2 Solo 1 Duo: The rise of generic solo laners in competitive play (analysis article),PraiseLoL,69,12,12,"Until recently in League of Legends, this identity has become less fixed, top and middle laners are now subjected to 1v2s

First and foremost, in order to fit what they hope to achieve with their strategy. An example of this would be to send Caitlyn &amp; Fiddlesticks middle, with the intention to fast-push the turret against a team with weak wave clear. A laner with superior dragon control, or team fight potential such as Orianna may then be placed bottom, with a split-pusher or duelist such as Zed being placed in the top lane. Looking at this structure, not much is different from the traditional lane setup; bottom simply swaps with the middle laner. However, it is not the result, that is significant, but in order to implement a strategy.

So why is this lane setup superior to the traditional setup?  Simply put, mid v mid, etc). This means that if someone was counter-picked, or simply less skilled than their opponent, they were forced into an unfavourable matchup, usually relying on jungle pressure (which took pressure off the rest of the map). Interestingly, this was why the final pick was valued so highly for the top lane in North America for much of Season 2, and the pressure drawn from having a winning matchup.

In the current meta, whereas the traditional lane matchups are not important. This is one of the main advantages of running 2 solos and 1 duo: you can pick for your team composition and generally not be forced into bad matchups, through lane swapping. It has been well documented in competitive play that team compositions are more important than lane matchups (unless a massive gold lead is accrued in the laning phase), and thus, picking for the team composition will always be superior to picking for the lane.

There have been many notable occasions where the 2 solo 1 duo setup has been used in competitive play – in fact every time a lane swap occurs, Cpt Jack and Lustboy, is notorious for dying in lane 2v2, despite having good team fight play and mechanics. For many of their games this season however, they adapted by laning 2v1 either middle or top – reducing the impact of one of the main weaknesses in their team. If they had followed the traditional lane setup, this weakness may have been a greater problem during Champions. In addition to this, the 2v1 lane allows Blaze to fast push an early turret with the jungler, using the 2 solo 1 duo setup gave Blaze 2 notable benefits: 1) The ability to avoid their bottom lane’s weak laning phase and 2) Early strategic victory through fast pushing a turret.

Recent champion picks have also made it obvious that teams are now leaning towards two generic solo laners. To elaborate, Kha’Zix, Ryze, and Zed – all have previously been found in the traditional top and middle lanes. When previously there was well defined, non-overlapping champions for both the mid and top lanes, now the distinction is not so clear. Even champions who have only been played in the middle lane traditionally, such as Karthus or Orianna, in order to implement specific strategies.

Another interesting change has been for many teams to recently swap their “official” top and mid positions. While this has little impact on where the players lane, and Reapered’s old team all announced that they were swapping the top and mid positions, with Maknoon also talking about moving to mid. It appears that the reason for the change, with the exception of TSM, is to move the leaders of the teams (Hai, Reapered, Maknoon) to the middle lane; this may be indicative of a shotcalling position.

*Note: TSM’s Reginald moved to the top lane however

The 2 solo 1 duo setup provides flexibility, without worrying about individual lane matchups. It is not a strategy, but a framework that provides teams all of these benefits. While it has already made its way into competitive play, it is a development in the meta that has been almost overlooked by the average viewer, up until recently. This advancement is one of the most interesting progressions in competitive strategy to date, and I believe it will be very important, moving forward in competitive play.

1327896059.0,p2jos,The Current State of League of Legends Jungling,Lacesso,64,6,34,"Hello

As a quick precursor to my discussion

In the snowball meta of League of Legends that is becoming popular, since the prevalence of Support(wardbot) +carry bot it has become much more popular to always ward lanes and nearly impossible to gank with many junglers that used to be considered top tier. These changes in the metagame have led to what I see as two distinct types of junglers emerging that work completely differently. 

The first type of jungler that is viable now is one that can reliably perform early ganks by sneaking past common ward spots or that has easy to use gap closers that can lead to kills. A couple of examples would be a Shaco or Lee Sin that starts at red and goes straight to a lane to try and get a kill. This type of jungler has the ability to get a strong lead early on

This second type of jungler is one that may not have remarkable early game ganks, Skarner, etc that clear the jungle extremely fast, can get fast items, can typically counter-jungle, and at level 6 have abilities that give them incredibly strong ganks. Shyvana was recently demonstrated to be a strong jungler at Kiev and at level 6 she has the ability to swoop in from a multitude of angles and pull off strong ganks in any lane. Junglers like WW work like this to a certain extent because they have a significant increase in utility at level 6 , however due to slower farming

These are the trends that I'm seeing in the current jungle

By doing this and getting a **singular** kill

A double kill with this 150 stacks would give 150/2=75/2=36 rounded up

So it would give a base of 600 gold

Now lets keep in mind, as long as they were in quick succession.  But I'm pretty sure they wouldn't make it do that,  considering that with 200 stacks you'd get four kills worth of gold off a double kill.

1364088244.0,1aw2xh,Major Udyr changes coming: a detailed analysis of the PBE patch notes,GANGBANGARANG,64,8,30,"With each new PBE patch comes welcome change to the fields of justice

It seems like just yesterday that Udyr was one of the most dominant predators the top lane had ever seen

The winds of change were not favorable to Udyr, was strong enough without it. Soon, the majestic manbearphoenix was nigh extinct, lost to the sands of time...

But Riot knows pity

The tentative PBE changes: www.reignofgaming.net/news/23644-unofficial-pbe-patch-notes-for-3-22-2013

**Passive**

The theme of this major update to Udyr seems to be usability, but as birds with brittle bones, Udyr must shed some of his defenses to soar once more. This is one of three maneuverability buffs that should allow Udyr to better keep pace with the rest of the league in its advanced state of mobility creep.

**Tiger Stance**

The least changed of his 4 abilities, I think, is a dangerous direction to go as it specifically makes Randuin's Omen too hard a counter to tigerdyr--but there are ways around that with slow reductions and the newly buffed phoenix stance.

**Turtle Stance**

Turtle stance is to lose two unique mechanics with these changes: with Taric's passive change, Atma, and Ghostblade to keep his offensive power from falling off a cliff lategame even if you choose to build for it. The biggest change to turtle is that with the mana cost reductions and mana leech removal, Udyr is no longer dependent on turtle to keep his mana up. This is a bigger deal in top lane than it might seem as it gives you more freedom to use rank 1 stances for trades, escapes, and engages, and gives turtle a better-defined role as a purely defensive skill. The increased shield strength at later levels helps mitigate the loss of bonus resists as well and will probably be the first place Riot looks at for buffs in the future if this overhaul does not quite hit the mark.

""Now hold on, ""this sounds fucking terrible! Tiger and turtle are the staple skills of top Udyr and both of them are losing key elements of their strength. Why do you sound so goddamned eager about one of your favorite champs being gutted like a fish?""

**Bear Stance**

Ignores unit collision. Have 3 words ever sounded so beautiful? In addition, animation cancel) through the target for effective chasing distance. This is a major usability change, and since bear is typically left at rank 1 through the laning phase, it benefits the most from the mana buffs. This is the most exciting change for most Udyr players and is probably the driving reason for the power shifts elsewhere as it would be nearly impossible to balance with Live Udyr's raw strength.

**Phoenix Stance**

Notice how I said most Udyr players above? That's because I'm most excited about this one: Phoenix activates on the first and every third hit after instead of just every third. It's losing the free AP and AD to help mitigate this buff (and because free ""invisible"" stats are something Riot has been making a concerted effort to cull in favor of gameplay-oriented elements--of the past 10 champion releases, phoenix stance was a typically poor choice in top lane because it pushed hard and was difficult to get on-third-hits on the enemy. Now you can combo tiger into phoenix (the same way you currently do with bear) for a huge first hit and then have the option to switch to bear to set up another offensive rotation. Pop phoenix again after your 3rd hit for double aoe chunks. With the switch to a physical tiger stance, phoenix should fill the mixed damage void nicely.

What does this mean for future builds? I think 1 pt in tiger will become standard unless you're seriously snowballing the lane, and Bork, Triforce and Gauntlet should remain extremely solid pickups. Alacriswifties are already practically broken against heavy slows and will remain the ideal choice if they're not drowning in hard cc or heavy physical damage. Randuin, Sunfire, Mallet, Mogs, Locket, Wits

1375706311.0,1jqirg,In defense of support Zilean,verywary,73,19,48,"Masteries: 9/0/21.  Take CD and Mag Pen in Offense

Runes: Mag Pen reds

Starting items: Flask and 2 wards.

Support Zilean is an excellent choice.  Start Q (bomb).  Ward the river and sit in the bushes.  Use your long AA range and bombs to zone the hell out of the enemy carry.  Your goal is to pop out and place an AA bomb AA every time the carry comes close.  Start harrassing hard and keep strong- don't give up control of the bushes if you can.  At lvl 2, W, Q, AA for that poke.  Those 2 bombs have excellent base damages.  The enemy carry will be taken to 1/2 hp with one combo.  Your AD carry should be farming untouched, or happy to jump in for a kill if the positioning is good.  At 3, get E for the gank escapes or kill chases (excellent on Vayne, for example).  Then max Q.  

In an ideal world, or vice versa.  Almost nobody does the right thing- stand next to the creeps so my bomb hits them, denying the carry gold.  Nobody does that, especially when our harrass is so strong.

At 6, then reviving under a tower and winning the fight.  

Take 2 lvls of E, it's about a 22 second ultimate.  

From flask wards get philo stone and sighstone.  When you have E lvled up, W, E, W, E, (etc) till you get wherever you are going.  Quickly.

Next get boots of CD

Now you can do things like:  Oh no a team fight! Speed your AD carry(E), Rewind (W), Rebomb their carry doing AOE damage (Q), Slow their diver again (E), oh no protect the carry (R), Carry comes back to life! 
That is one burst with only global CDs.  That can all be done in 3 seconds or so.

Cons: What? No. Well

Till lvl 3, and you need to bush bomb to accomplish that.

1360424308.0,1870uu,Void staff is a better first item than deathcap for Leblanc.  Also magic pen spreadsheet,,59,8,38,"Here is the spread sheet:
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AofYL952iD_BdGV6VmNuWXl2eXJiVE1iQkRfdkRZc1E#gid=0

What i have found by doing some arithmetic is that void staff is better than deathcap on Leblanc, and irrelevant blues and yellows(you can pretend they are magic resist and hp per level if you want to).  They also have Sorceror's shows, 6 flat ap from masteries, 1 ap per level, 8% magic pen, and 5% increased ap.  The difference between the two leblancs is that the first one has a deathcap(3200 gold) and the second one has a void staff and a blasting wand(3155 gold).

The first column is the ability.  The second is the item build.  The third gives the damage it does.  You can scroll to the right to see all the math that generated those numbers.  As you can see, but her other abilities will do less damage.  Her w and abilities at this point have 1 or two skill points in them so they have low base damage.  The higher level she gets the better void staff becomes for these abilities.

Even factoring in those abilities, land w on them,land chains on them,get full damage on snare, use Q on them without activating the second part of sigil because you are out of cooldowns.  If you look at this comparison, void staff plus blasting wand does 30 more damage.

That might not seem like a lot, the void staff Q hits harder than the deathcap Q.  The enemy getting magic resist from runes or items widens the gap and makes void staff do even more work.

If you change all the relevant fields you can use this spreadsheet for other champions, and other magic resistances.  You'll find that the void blasting wand combo is more damaging than death cap on nearly every champion.

The old meta revolved around these idea:

1. Mid mages got solo exp because they scale on lvls more than gold early and mid game.  Mages also used to be significantly less mobile (ie Brand, Kat, Rumble, Kayle etc)

2. ADC and support defaulted to bot because it provided 3 people near dragon for each team.  With ADC and support mid

3. ADC and support mid means that we basically have another roamer in the support that can gank either lane.  Mid is a short lane making it easier to get to safety if support leaves to gank.  

For a while

I believe this could become standard because it addresses all the ideas that formed the old meta while adding the ability for a second roaming ganker in the support.

Support in lobby:
You only voulnteer to support if someone types adc,
let someone else support

Which support should I pick?:
It depends
Why this order?You shouldn't primarly adapt to their adc because he will care with creeps mainly
And don't get me wrong
Remeber this aswell when picking support Burst &gt; Sustain &gt; Poke &gt; Burst

Masteries
There are several combinations that are a bit off traditional meta.
Trading/poking much? don't be afraid to get 11 points in defense.
Runnin on slow champs or someone who should outrun them? MS quints
Their jungle will gank 24/7? Gold/10 masteries runes quints everytinhg so you'll have money to ward
You are with zyra lulu lux or sona? get some scaling ap runes

Okey game has started what do i buy?
There are several ways to start/early items.
faerie charm or bead are pretty basic for me
if not and afraid of their jungler then 4 wards and 1 pot
(except in the case of sona
Get charm or pen depending on how much sustain you have.
my preference-&gt; bead-&gt;tresh

You are in lane
You always make an impact on the game
GO POKE MAKE THEM AFRAID OF YOU but of course being reckless is bad

1st back what should I get?:
philo stone is standard for most of the champs who depends on mana
If you are one of those all in monsters like thresh, or an early sightstone
if you are not doing that well.

Wards
As much as you can afford, and you can keep track
of where he is in the next 1 min for sure.Pinks?You can make them more afraid of you and less likely to go all in since they will expect your jungler to come.

What is your role in a teamfight?:
This is hard to explain because you have so many duties and it varies which one has priority based on your team their team and on who's fed and on who are you.

Always keep track of timers

I think Twitch is a VERY viable ADC.  Everybody says he's bad but I don't get it.  Anybody who doesn't think he's good

First off

Early game try to just farm and play passive.  Once you hit level 4 you can start trading a little.  I usually enter a bush, hit W, pop 3 or 4 shots (no more than 4) walk away and expunge.  If your support has some sort of hard engage, you can expunge and keep attacking and it's a kill.  The true damage keeps going even after expunging, I've gotten many kills well after they've retreated and the suspense is always pretty fun :o


**Build:**

(I'd first like to note

  Start a Doran or 2.  

I ALWAYS rush Black Cleaver.

Zeal

Executioner's Calling

Phantom Dancer

IE/Tiamat (depends)

Defensive (usually GA)



This build keeps him strong at mid game and makes the best use of his abilities.  Black Cleaver is stronger on twitch than any other carry in my opinion.  With any sort of positioning you can reduce the armor of an entire team with his ult

Executioner's Calling is already a good item

Tiamat is situational on team comp and honestly probably not usually viable

   &gt; Twitch's ""Spray and Pray"" can trigger Tiamat on multiple enemies at once

Also makes Twitch an amazing pusher with a surprisingly reliable escape

Final thing to note is I play Korean server only (since I live in Korea).  Not sure if relevant

Sorry, quite possibly moreso in lower elos than higher (but I think it's important for people to play according to their elo, rather than copy what pros do in tournament settings which is an entirely different game).

Let me know what you think

1339856244.0,v50ev,Things we could learn from DoTA2 Meta,yarpus,66,19,42,"Hi there! There was a guy who posted an awesome ""guide to watch DoTA2 as LoL player"" which can be found [here.](http://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/v3dsh/as_promised_my_primer_to_watching_dota_2_for/) This and recent DoTA2 matches which I've seen made me to start thinking about stuff we could learn from people playing this game. I'm obviously waiting for your suggestions. Here are mine.

**Support isn't a champion who heals. He is champion who doesn't care about scalings/experience and can work without farm.** 

* used in the same way as Windrunner

* support Nautilus fits the bill of maximizing utility on bottom lane. If for some reason he is not picked for jungling

* we also could consider putting Tanks in support role. Champions like Maokai or Malphite brings much more utility than any known support (except of maybe Janna).

**Physical Carry doesn't need to be ranged. He just has to be capable of dealing lots of damage.**

* same as Anti-Mage is currently dominating DoTA's meta

*Actually Wickd played Fiora/Janna bottom lane a bit

**Pushing towers wins games**

* DoTA makes a great use of champions capable of pushing creep waves in an instant - with the best example of Leshrac. Early towers means early global gold advantage for your team. Pushing towers is currently an important problem in League of Legends

- AP Champions like Ziggs

**Roamers are still awesome**

* we might consider running AD Carry/Support mid lane. Why? Because most of supports are pretty awesome at ganking! As someone who plays lots of both Support and Jungle Alistar - I've learned to love Ali's ganking potential. Support at mid-lane would be capable of warding all the important spots on map

That's all I managed to pull off here. Bring some discussion about those points and feel free to add yours!",,t5_2smhl,1339856668.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/LeagueofLegendsMeta/comments/v50ev/things_we_could_learn_from_dota2_meta/
1370133002.0,1fhrc3,Up From EloHell: How to carry your noob feeder team,BlueNoseReindeer,65,15,27,"Another one of my posts originally from the main league reddit. As always

For those of you who haven't been on the internet very long

A bit more seriously, and would like to share some of those things.


* 1. Attitude is the most important thing. I like to keep track of helpful posts I find on this reddit about improving as a player, as well as humble in ""Freelo"" games is a necessary element in making comebacks/not throwing. What's more, **if you ever want to get out of ""EloHell,"" you can't believe that it exists**.

For example, I found myself starting off the game with 2 deaths, no flash, and no blue buff as Nautilus, with a Fiora as our top laner (not someone I expect much from). Every single lane was losing early, and we started off 0-6, with everyone being behind level and cs. However, and waited for them to make a mistake. Sure enough, which leads them to make foolish decisions

On the other hand, and blue on the invade, leading us on to a 9-0 + dragon start. We got cocky, and threw hard (fortunately they threw back, and we won in 50 minutes). I've lost games where we were up 17-1 with 5 towers and 2 dragons because of one simple rule: **good items can't replace good play**. When you get a giant lead it becomes tempting to mess around, get lots of kills, max out your build, ignoring what your enemy can do

As a last note on this subject, and the performance of everyone on your team who has to listen (and if you do it in all chat, it will boost the morale of the enemy team. Don't think so? What's your reaction when you see the other team flaming each other in allchat?). Trying to tell people how to play generally isn't a good idea either, unless they are asking for help even the best advice will usually be taken the wrong way. **Solo Queue is where you improve yourself, not the random people you get paired with, energy that you use to think about their mistakes (whether you bring them up or not) is energy that you aren't using to think about your mistakes.** That being said, sometimes criticism (usually not the constructive kind either) from your teammates can help you see what you're doing wrong (and sometimes they're completely off their rocker). If you can use the criticism they give you productively, you will do well in Solo Queue. I go into matches assuming that my team is going to be disagreeable (until they prove otherwise, it makes a huge difference

It may not be something you feel like putting effort into


* 2. Study the game, not just your own experiences. Streams, wikis, advice videos, guides, reddit, lolking,* and always be on the lookout for more sources. What's more

Big streamers are big for a reason (usually because they are on a team), and try out smaller guys sometimes. You will find some you like, and some you don't, but one very nice thing about all streamers with small audiences (that I've seen) is that you can ask any/all questions you have and expect an answer. One streamer I like that generally has &lt;100 viewers even asks his audience for questions so that he can kill time between ques!

Never latch on to any strategy/build/item/champion/comp etc. as something definite. People are always learning more about both the game and the current meta

Make it your goal to always be learning something new about the game. For example, successful strategies, or a high level game that you notice something in. **The key here is making a goal that you can stick to, and achieving it in a way that is still *enjoyable*.** Believe it or not, learning is something humans naturally enjoy, it's just  the way we go about it that sometimes makes the process unenjoyable. League should be something you enjoy doing, if it isn't

* 3. Take risks. Don't try to make plays that you know have little to no chance of success, and making decisions that help the rest of the team but challenge you personally are the type of risks you want to take. Why? Because these are the types of risks that will help you learn. If you ""can't carry hard enough"" for your ""noob feeder team,"" wouldn't you like to learn more so that you can? You can't change the types of teams you get, but you can change your performance and behavior, so focus on those.

Diving into the entire enemy team at baron pit while its till at half health is not a risk, or let the support ward around before starting baron. If they don't have wards, have them stand in the river bush as a lookout. Learn the difference between making a decision hastily (foolish) and hesitating to follow a decision (also foolish), disciplining yourself to make good decisions and not hesitate to follow them is a skill that every player regardless of rank needs to work on. 

There isn't much I can talk about specifically in this area, and if you don't then you have something to be happy about. **The reason why risk taking is worth it in the long run is because it gets you *doing* more: thinking more, learning more, firing brain cells more.** It puts you in new situations that make you do unexpected things, which may not be successful themselves, but allow you to learn more which helps you succeed in the long run.

1331914553.0,qzj51,How Do I Lane Against... Series Debut! This week - Riven!,jtiza,61,12,12,"[Link to OP](http://www.reddit.com/r/summonerschool/comments/qyj7x/how_do_i_lane_against_series_debut_this_week_riven/).

**Like learning things?  Like teaching?  Realize that there's a ton of stuff you could do better?  Come to [/r/summonerschool](/r/summonerschool) and join in on the teaching/learning/streaming party!**

There are plenty of guides for how to play *as* champions, probably for the rest of my life at the rate Riot is releasing champs.  Content will be reposted on [Summoner Academy](www.summoneracademy.com) within a day or so.

**Riven - The Exile**

[Abilities and Stats](http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/Riven)

* **Potential Roles**: Melee AD Carry, gank-oriented AD jungler
* **Lanes**: Top
* **Common item choices**: Doran's Blade (stacking), Bloodthirster, Guardian Angel, Frozen Mallet
* **Things to know**: Lots of short-range AOE CC, very mobile, ult gives range and damage increase with big AOE finisher.
* **Beat her with**: safe early play, stacking armor
* **Good counter choices**: Kennen, Teemo, Nidalee, Malphite, Cho'Gath, Olaf

**Game Phases**

**Early Game**: Play safe and avoid her combo.  Don't be afraid to fall behind in CS to avoid getting killed.

**Mid Game**: Judge the situation to see if you can start trading with her.  Be very careful about her teamfight presence - she will seriously wreck your carries if given a chance.

**Late Game**: You can burst her down if you focus her hard - her shield becomes less effective against big lategame damage.  If she didn't build survivability

**General Playstyle**

Riven is an excellent top lane choice, and her CC can lock a single target down for the entire chain.  In teamfights, her mobility and shield will allow her to march right up to your squishy carries and demolish them before they know what happened.  Her mobility comes from abilities, which makes slows much less effective - but makes silence that much stronger.

* Riven usually wants to win her lane by level 4.  Take away her early-game dominance by playing very safe and not letting her get you in her combo.
* She's pure AD
* Her combo is very strong, and her Q is always a 13-second cooldown)
* Interrupting Riven's combo with hard CC or a silence will drive her crazy and take away a lot of her laning power.  If you can force her to play passively against you
* Riven is a beast under tower
* Her ult CD is 75 / 60 / 45 - that's really short for a big steroid.  It's a 20% bonus AD (!) and a range increase on all attacks for 15 seconds. You do NOT want to fight Riven when she has her ult up - just keep your distance and let it burn itself out.
* Riven is a monster in midgame teamfights - she can use her abilities to quickly get to and lock down the squishy of choice
* Late game
* As a jungler, and she'll suffer greatly for lack of farm.

Masteries 9-21-0, I know you usually want to build Gragas AP, but fuck that. The AD scaling on his W and E are too good to ignore now that he has better armor to get in people's faces more. Also, the E got a speed buff so that's great.

Build Metagolem, Randuins, Atmas, that sort of thing) gives you, and you can alter the build to counter the enemy team if the need arises. 

During teamfights, just dive in and put your fat in their faces, using Randuins or your ult to keep the other team disorganized and frantic. If not, just chill with your front line champs and wait for the opportunity to go in. If the other team is aggressive, sit near your AD carry and dog pile on anyone who tries to jump them, you have the ability to lay down some serious hurt and still fulfill tanking duties at the same time. 

I think Graggy is very viable as an AD based laner with these recent buffs to his health, I honestly think I'm going to start using it in ranked. I've even jungled with this twice and done well. (Wriggles, Tabis, gank the fuck out of everything and jump over walls with the body slam to avoid ward coverage)

Have fun out there!

**TL;DR** Gragas is beefy and can still deal solid damage while tanking and using his ult to mess up teamfights. Screw AP

1340671361.0,vlpmg,Indomitable/Tough Skin - The masteries with the fitting name.,difftheender,48,2,31,"### Intro
Hey guys
Diff here again and after that amazing welcome you guys gave me - I just wanted to thank you for making me feel at home &lt;3

I've been working on my next article and I've completed the video version of it. I'm still in the process of completing the written version which should go up tomorrow. I'll be cross-posting that to the main Lol reddit.


I view readers as falling into one of 4 categories.

* Sponges - soak in information and apply it accordingly
* Whiteboards - Memorise everything then forget it shortly
* Blackboards - Memorise everything and keep it.
* Porcupines - Will defend what they have heard/believe regardless of what you throw at them.


Since you guys have been so kind to me and I figured you're all sponges and super-smart

### The topic
I was very curious about how effective the damage reduction masteries in the defence tree really were. The masteries in question were Tough Skin and Indomitable. I went ahead and did some math on it and the results/full discussion can be seen in this video: 

http://youtu.be/H8TjNobQ7jk

I'll try and summarise the conclusions in as few words as possible:

&gt; Effective Armor Increase due to these masteries are very high

&gt; The other masteries in the defence tree are also much more desirable than the ones in the offensive tree for AD Bruisers. Due to these reasons
[9/21/0](http://thefwcentral.com/lol/#&amp;trees=1-3-0-0-4-0-0-0-1-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-3-3-2-4-3-2-1-0-0-0-2-0-0-0-1-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0) &gt; [21/9/0](http://thefwcentral.com/lol/#&amp;trees=1-3-0-0-4-0-0-4-1-0-0-1-3-0-3-0-0-0-1-3-0-4-0-0-1-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0)
 

###Points of Discussion

I think there's a lot of potential for discussion with this topic

 - Does ""invisible resistance"" have an effect on how aggressive your opponent plays? Can you fool them into thinking you're weaker than you actually are?
 - Does the utility of the defensive masteries outweigh the sheer damage from the offensive masteries?
 - Do you think that you will be using 9/21 over 21/9 due to these results? Why/why not?

I hope you guys found the article useful. Let's get some discussion going :3

I've been experimenting with her a lot since the recent patch (I like trying to make unpopular and underappreciated champs ""work"") and my impressions have been pretty mixed (keep in mind I'm Gold III so not pro by any means):

- Not a good pure bot lane support. Not a 100-&gt;0 burst-type mage. Don't think I need to elaborate on this. IMO best fits the role of a utility/sort of tanky/sustained damage mage a la Ryze, Rumble, etc. I've played her both top/mid and honestly I think she is a better top champ built somewhat tanky.

- Good in 1v1 trades and kiting. Great mobility, assassins without silence), she can be strong.

- That said: SQUISHY &amp; LOW RANGE (!), crappy AA animation. All of it just KILLS much of the supposed strengths of her kit.

- Awful waveclear for a mage-type champ. Only 1 ability can target minions! (I know Mantra E does damage

- Requires a lot of itemization to feel impactful. Very reliant on mana/CDR for Q spam. Extremely important to hit your Q in team fights and have Mantra up as often as possible; otherwise you just become a walking cannon minion. 
RoA and Athene's are core imo. Deathcap too. That's a lot of farm and up to that point, CDR, mana/mana reg). If her W could target minions and some of her base stats buffed (like AD and health) I think she'd be much more potent.

1362919696.0,1a0sch,Magic Resist items... its just me or...?,Zarq29,57,9,63,"Hi /r/leagueoflegendsmeta :)

Im used to play tanks champs since I start playing

When im looking for Armor items, Tabi Boots, Iron Solari, Randuins, you could get a lot of Armor items no matter wich role are you playing... but when the enemy team have 2-3 AP champs (lets say Ahri, Cho'gath and Amumu) the thing is not that easy for me.

its just me or almost every Magic Resist item are very

Lets start with Negatron Cloak, Abyssal Scepter, Quicksilver Sash and Spirit Visage. All of them are really situational and don't fit on a lot of champs. Spirit Visage it's great, but with a wasted pasive if you dont have a big self-heal or life steal/spell vamp based champ. QSS is extremly situational and too much focused on the active, and playing bruisers/tanks you wont ever consider it. Abyssal its an AP and more offensive item. At last, Banshee's Veil its the best one, *in general terms"", its the one that I see less.
Comparing to Armor, Sunfire Cape, Randuin' Omen, Frozen Heart. All of them fit on any tanky champ and you can even build all of them in the same game.

Your AD mid should get plenty of farm mid. As for your bot lane AP not getting as much XP as their mid-lane AP

As for their AD/support bot lane outfarming your AP/Lulu bot lane, Morde, Vlad, Brand, etc. down there. The biggest drawback I can think of is having limited access to blue buff as a mana champ, so it will depend on what side you're on (you'd want to be on purple team for this to work best).

there are 3 ways i play Udyr--Tiger bruiser, and i tend to know going into a matchup which route I'm taking and rune/mastery accordingly.

**AP Phoenix**

R = W &gt; E &gt;&gt; Q (save for last)

Marks: **hybrid pen**
Seals: armor  
Glyphs: mr
Quints: AP

Masteries: literally anything works from full AP to full tank to utility to some mixture of them. tailor to your matchup. 

Summoners: flash or ghost

Start: Faeriecharm + ward + pots or flask + ward + pot (recall at 1:22 for an extra pot if you aren't needed to leash)

When to pick: you have a beefy team

if you're familiar with AP Tryn or my AP Skarner guide, sprint, and nuke to trade, escape, bait, and split push like crazy. avoid teamfights whenever possible and focus on peeling for squishies because you're very vulnerable to burst.

there are two basic ""combos"" to playing AP Udyr: Turtle &gt; (bear) &gt; Phoenix and Phoenix &gt; auto &gt; (bear) &gt; Phoenix. Either prime a shield as you go in to cs/harass or prime a Phoenix and use the first-hit splash to drop two breath attacks on the enemy in rapid succession. use the range of the breath to hit enemies hiding behind their minions and harass without drawing minion aggro. using bear is optional as early on it's a mana drain and sometimes you won't need it to harass.

there are two things about Udyr that it takes time to get a handle on: the 6s delay in between bear stance stuns

after you're CDR capped with this build

my core build generally looks like:  
Seraph's (tear finishes charging around the time nashor's is completed)  
CDR boots  
Nashor's Tooth

vs heavy AD:  
(Tear optional if you get an early glacial
Tabi  
Iceborn Gauntlet
Nashor's

After:  
Lichbane for optimal turret pushing and the MS is nice  
Deathcap if you are balling out of control  
Guinsoo's for dueling and pushing (always 8 stacks)  
Wits End and Twin Shadows vs AP  
Tank items if you just feel too squishy to contribute.

**Bruiser Phoenix/mixed**

Q first

Marks: **hybrid pen**
Seals: armor  
Glyphs: mr
Quints: AP

Masteries: 9/21/0 (magic pen if you think you're not gonna level tiger til later

Summoners: Flash or Ghost

Start: flask + ward + pot or red elixir/pots vs aggressive lane

When to pick: you want a semi-bruiser with good split push and strong teamfight presence. you want to pressure the lane without snowballing it. you want more versatility than an AP build. the enemy team has lots of slows and hard CC.

this build plays a lot like AP udyr with less focus on CDR and more on being an unstoppable wrecking ball. get in their face and laugh at their puny attempts to run. you still push quickly with Phoenix but you're less of a single minded split machine.

generally I'll pick this into enemies who struggle to farm under the tower and can be bullied out of cs early on. going QRRER for offensive output leaves you without turtle, leave it til last. if you do, whether you leave bear or turtle at 3 points should be decided by your needs in teamfights: mobility or durability. 

take ignite if you believe you can pick up a kill early

Core:  
boots of swiftness (unless they're very heavily a single damage type)  
Iceborn OR Wits End  
2nd defensive item OR Zephyr

Zephyr is very strong on Phoenix Udyr for the Aspd, and tenacity. especially in conjunction with swifties, you become practically impossible to kite. I'll generally get Iceborn sooner or later since it's another extremely strong pickup.

Later:  
Sunfire, anti-kite, or dmg reduction + CDR  
Triforce if you're steamrolling and don't have Iceborn  
BoRK to chase down their squishies and escape  
Visage or Hexdrinker or Banshees for MR  
Mallet if you are primarily peeling or chasing

**Bruiser Tiger**

Q = W &gt; E &gt; R (last)

Marks: **armor pen**
Seals: armor  
Glyphs: mr
Quints: AD

Masteries: 9/21/0  
21/9/0 if you're a *fucking man* and want to cheese early

Summoners: Flash or Ghost

Start: flask + ward + pot or red elixir/pots vs aggressive lane

When to pick: you want to punish the enemy early and chunk them every time they come to cs. they would have to sacrifice too much damage to build lots of armor. they're ranged and you want to put some points in turtle early to out-sustain. you want to dive their squishies.

Tiger stance got a fairly big overhaul. it's been changed to deal physical damage with a scaling total AD ratio, vulnerable early, easy to gank--or Nidalee--strong poke early, but can't fight head to head and can be caught and killed with bork in midgame.

you need to use the threat of a tiger chunk to determine the flow of your lane. punish them when they cs or chase them off the line and soak their harass with turtle. you're strongest at level 1, run out the cooldown, and launch 2 in quick succession before switching to bear to follow up or run. 

force them to facecheck--catching the blue side top laner in the river bush is a classic udyr strategy to double tiger them early. vs very squishy foes you can red elixir and/or ignite to get your ad as high as possible and force a flash or recall or pick up a kill.

Core:  
Tabi
optional Doran's shields vs ranged and 1-2 blades if you can't afford cutlass on first back  
BorK

After:  
Hydra for stupid waveclear and stacked lifesteal--including from Turtle  
Brutalizer if you're snowballing hard--Ghostblade to dive/burst and BC if your team is physical heavy  
Hexdrinker/SV vs heavy magic dmg  
Omen/Sunfire/FH/Iceborn vs AD  
LW if they stack armor  
Stark's if you're not doing so hot

1370229305.0,1fk4jm,How to Get More from Your Solo Que Team: Coordinating with Strangers,BlueNoseReindeer,57,17,14,"This is the last of my ""already posted on the main league reddit"" posts (tuned up because it was fairly sucky before), etc. in the comments.

We've all had those times where our teammates do mind-numbingly stupid things (Why did the &lt;200 hp Trist jump INTO the roaming Lux with all of her abilities up when she could have just clicked the lantern or walked/jumped away?)

""Why didn't you ult!"" ""There was never a good opportunity

Today I'll discuss how you can function better as a teammate to help avoid these types of situations.

1. **Low expectations.** Low expectations are the key to success. **If you have low expectations for your teammates you will not take as big of risks, making your team more coordinated.** If it is obvious that a fight is winnable if you engage it is much more likely that people will follow up than if it seems risky. Low expectations also help YOU to think better because you will not be dissapointed in your team as much, and you will be pleasantly surprised more, leaving you in a better frame of mind to make decisions.

2. **Get used to pinging.** Whenever you can, jungler mia, wave pushed to their tower, etc.). Similarly, when calling to go for Dragon/Baron/Tower it's good to use a double or triple ping, or when calling to break off from that objective. (Just as a side note, a good rule of thumb for when to break off from Dragon/Baron, is if it is more than 1/4 HP you should pull out of range where it can damage you. If it is less than 1/4 HP it is usually worth finishing off. Note that this assumes relatively even teamfight potential for both teams

3. **""You do no damage!""** This is something I hear all the time, usually). However, sometimes the people in those positions are just bad, and won't be able to properly utilize the extra gold. As a rule of thumb, the 1-2 players that ARE dealing the most damage (not who has the highest potential) for your team are who you want to give kills and farm to. If the carries aren't good, that means you need to keep continual pressure on the enemy team, and end the game as soon as possible. Bruisers/Assassins (top, sometimes mid) can do really well midgame

4. **Let yourself get carried.** If the other 2 lanes are winning then there is pressure on your lane opponent(s) to start making big plays. Expect the jungler to be coming as well, and you can make it much harder for the winning lanes to carry the game. If your lane opponent(s) don't try to make plays, then you have have a definitive edge going into teamfights. If they do try to make plays, you can catch them doing stupid stuff, and the kill potential is higher than if *you* tried to force the action. Moreover, **everyone has poor games, and sometimes it's up to you to *not lose* rather than win.**

5. **Help the stragglers.** No matter how well you are doing laning, and even donate kills (I know this seems to contradict an earlier point, you have to learn the difference (from experience) between someone who is behind and can use a kill to catch up, and someone who is bad and won't use a kill productively) if you are doing really well already. Also, **if someone is behind (i.e. a Nautilus that got counterjungled), realize that they are behind, and can't contribute as much as usual.** If you can, but don't expect them to be able to fulfill their role as fully as normal, at least temporarily. If your carries are behind

6. **Understand each position.** This doesn't mean you have to play each position regularly, you can better work with and against them.**

7. **Farmers and Fighters.** In my experiences, and the ones who live for battle, never backing down from a fight. Think of this as a spectrum, and try to determine where on this spectrum your teammates fall. Understanding this will give you insight into how likely they are to start a fight/follow up/come back in for a kill when low/etc. Sometimes you need to tell people to be more passive/aggressive, but most of the time **you will see better results if you modify your own behavior to work with theirs.**

8. **Positive Attitude.** I don't care if they are the worst (fill in the blank) you've ever seen, and the rest of your team. The team that spends it's time/energy fighting each other performs poorly. They lose even matches, they throw wins, they don't make comebacks. Most toxicity dies if you ignore it, so if someone says you are the worst (fill in the blank) they've ever seen, ignore them, and if they keep going with negative comments, it's there for a reason. I personally find it helpful to keep note cards with various things written on them by my computer when I play, so take extra precautions when you type, gjs

9. **TeamWithPlan &gt; TeamWithoutPlan.** This is the main reason why pinging helps so much, the opposite is also true, even if you can't see it in the chat. Every time your team wins a fight, takes on objective, prevents a death, etc. their faith in each other and their confidence increases, leading to more calls, etc. If your team doesn't have a plan,** so make sure people come with you to push mid before you put yourself at risk

10. **Whenever you have to choose, and your best chance is to help your adc by peeling that Zed off. The more you help your teammates the less their mistakes will affect the team, as well as putting you in situations where you will make less mistakes. Just remember the lifeguard's rule when helping teammates: **if there is serious danger to yourself, it's best to just let them go.** Better to go 0-1 than 0-2.

I like to play Warick very much but i dont really know how he fits in s3 meta. So i've tried playing him like in s2 (wits, wriggles) with mixed results. 

I was wondering if some of you guys figured out how to build Warwick (both solo and jungle) recently? 

Also, spirit of lizard, wits end and BotRK and blue buff) but I think he can do it much earlier. I'm testing it right now but I was wondering if someone figured it out? (like the 15 min duo baron with a Nunu maxing q and cdr ala GamersLegends)

1362487073.0,19pc6k,Diana Jungle is underated,barnzy12,55,13,43,"Alright! Clue is in the title.
I think that Diana jungle is under-rated and under played.

I have been playing Diana in the jungle recently and holy alistar (get it? Because he's a cow.) it is fun

I was playing Xin Zhao jungle a lot before his nerf and yes

Then I thought, but then remembered what someone said ""DON'T FEED DIANA!"" Before Diana had her nerf a while back she was played in jungle a bit. I never really thought it was that strong, mainly because I warded my lane so she could never gank, but it seems since she was nerfed she has been forgotten (In Jungle).

I would say
Kills - 9.7
Deaths - 2.4
Assists - 18.3
Creeps - 97.1

Now I have been following my usual jungle style
But the goal with Diana is to get to level 6 and 2/3 kills as fast as you can because you can then get your jump, but lower league it doesn't matter and 90% of the time you will snowball hard, also to keep the laning phase going for as long as possible, because the longer the opponents are in lane, the more you can gank. Much like Warwick, but give your lanes support by poking every now and again, trying to waste the opponents summoner spells. 

Diana's Kit is by far the most aggressive kit I know for jungle once you are level 6. Because you simply W &gt; Q (Hit) &gt; R &gt; E &gt; R &gt; Q.
By then either you are dead or they are

Late game I have been looking at this a lot and it seems that if your top is tanky enough e.g. Raid Boss Garen/Shen/Darius. Then you will be fine

I think that this is the Jungle to learn if you are low league trying to get out of the ""League Hell"" to try and get into Gold/Plat, helps all lanes and with a bit of IQ, can be very, very strong.

The last thing I want to say is that if you are first pick and you pick Diana, it's my favorite! :D

Now this was accidental


Some notes:

* Leeching the big wraith does not slow down the jungler reaching level 2 at all since he gets it after blue's exp gain alone.

* Losing the exp could potentially hurt the jungler later on from reaching other levels where the amount might make the difference. In this case they could perhaps help the laner push to the turret after the gank so that the enemy laner loses experience and returns to lane level 1 with no minions. In the least the jungler would make up a bit of the difference they lost from the wolf.

I think there's going to be so much changing over the next few weeks that focusing on specific champions might be pointless. Particularly abusive cases are almost certain to be removed. Instead, and how each archtype will change (e.g., will ranged carries go for a 'Hurricane' build most of the time? Ever? Or will single-target DPS builds still dominate.

Will builds of Black Cleaver + Tiamat/Hurricane become common on toplaners

Will melee ADCs start to make more of an appearance? Will assassins be viable in the new jungle (since it's been said they like the higher gold rewards)

Will Kage's Last Breath and Frozen Fist make diving AD carries easier and force them to get defensive items earlier, and Mercurial Scimitar make ADCs even safer than before? 

Will supportive-tank-junglers rush Ohmwreaker to make tower dives at every opportunity? Will 2.5s actually be long enough to make a difference late game

How to AD casters do in this season? I think Tiamat will be amazing on them, and having a solid upgrade. Running the numbers on Renek shows that Tiamat is way more damage than Brutalizer in every situation, and Hydra is way more damage than a Bloodthirster. And that's only considering single-target.

Who builds Manamune? Anyone? 

With Distortion boots, and a possibility to teleport to the wraiths from Wraith Collar - will teleport become common? 

What about barrier? Where is that going to fit in? Teams that plan to tower-dive early? Or are scared that they'll be getting dived? How will it compete with Heal?

1340388000.0,vg1sn,Jungle Fiddlesticks or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Grail,GameGuruTB,43,6,36,"**Big wall'o'text

I've been maining the role of jungler for a while now, his reliance on blue. It's the exact solution I've been adopting on any mid mage I play that is restricted by mana and cooldowns.

Okay so, Boots, and into Zhonya's leaves fiddle with a major weakness. Without Blue, he runs out of mana really, really fast. Consider then, delaying your Zhonya's by a mere 890 gold and getting a Chalice of Harmony after your Kage's Pick + boots 1.

Yes, far outweighs* the deficit of setting back your hourglass by 890 gold. This benefit being, complete non-reliance on blue buff. With Fiddle's typical reliance on Blue, it means at best you're taking all the Blues your mid could be getting, at worst it means the enemy has taken your blue and you really have to suffer through fiddle's high mana costs.

Chalice gives him enough regen to be able to clear camps and gank without having to worry about running out of mana or having to buy mana potions. This means that if the enemy is stealing your blue, further providing an advantage.

The Pick+Chalice opening also provides a pretty good late game solution to Fiddle's other main drawback, can be interrupted. Pick and Chalice nicely build into Deathfire Grasp OR Morello's Evil Tome, and Athene's Unholy Grail. If Fiddle tries to use his Wind+Fear+Drain combo on someone, and the drain gets interrupted, he just sort of has to wait until his drain comes off cooldown. ~40% Cooldown Reduction from a DFG+Grail combo and masteries means that not only can he restart drain if it gets interrupted much quicker, but his long cooldowns on Fear, Dark Wind

My build generally on Fiddle has ended up looking relatively like this lately

Start: Amplifying Tome + 1 Mana Pot

Early core: Kage's Lucky Pick &gt; Boots 1 &gt; Chalice of Harmony &gt; Sorceror's Shoes

Mid game goals: Zhonya's Hourglass

Late game items: Athene's Unholy Grail, all built as needed.

**TL;DR: Making your first few items Kage's Pick

*As an aside

EDIT: Also, and Magic Pen reds, Fiddle gets 30 magic penetration and 10 MR reduction. This allows him to be doing basically True Damage to jungle creeps and high damage to the low MR enemy champions early on.

First off, this article isn't going to take into account things like Kassadin's mana restoration on each auto-attack, or Cassiopeia's reduced mana cost on successive spell casts, as that information is too highly specified.
tl;dr

* Early on, if a Lux is going into a Ryze, using her E to push waves will force him to miss out on cs, or use much more mana than she did to get that cs, so it's worth it for her to use abilities on minions. However, a Lux going against a Malzahar will have to clear quickly just to prevent being pushed.

* Look for opportunities to **have your cake and eat it too.** If you are Lux, you spend the same amount of mana while doing more with it.

* Autoattacks are highly underrated at low elos. **Early autoattacks are very powerful even for APs

* Going along with the previous point, this means remembering that minions will attack you based on the proximity of the enemy champion to their minions (not your proximity to their minions). If you lose a significant trade you have to use your abilities more defensively for awhile, which means you won't be getting the most for your mana. As a rule of thumb, **you want your mana and hp bars to be within 20% (of their max) of each other.**

* When you are just harassing, but the damage will go up significantly. Exceptions to this rule would be CC abilities on champions that get more from autoattacks, such as Darius. Using hook/slow combo will start stacking bleeds and allow you to get lots of autos off.

* Maximize ability use. If you have a multi-target ability, go in for a trade (assuming it's relatively safe) because you can essentially heal yourself for free. Also, don't use an ability (skillshots in particular) just because you have it, have confidence the shot will do something productive before you decide to invest in it. This point more or less relates back to knowing how your champion works specifically.

*  Unless you have Kha'Zix or someone else that you **know** you can all-in with early, so don't splurge with your mana until level 4-5 at least.

* Tear vs. Chalice vs. RoA. Every character is different,** and can stack it quickly (just an observation, it's usually for late-game characters, such as Ryze, Singed, and Karthus). RoA works very well with Tear on a lot of champions, but is often the sole sustain item for APs that don't use tons of mana (Cho'gath, Fizz). You usually only want to get one of these items (RoA/Seraph's on some champions being the exception)

1361303212.0,18u3j2,AP top lane Spindamere: sleeper OP or just a gimmick? (miniguide + discussion),GANGBANGARANG,48,8,27,"I've been seeing lots of AP top lane Tryndamere these days in solo queue so I've taken him for a spin to get a feel for the playstyle and want to share my findings. Spoiler alert: it's surprisingly effective.

AP Tryn fills a similar niche to Singed or Khazix in terms of using his obscene waveclear to control the flow of the lane and pressure his opponent far beyond what most champions would consider safe. By building high cdr and AP, meaning hundreds of hp a pop with just a little AP.

First
Arpen reds/armor yellows/mr blues/AP quints.

For masteries, 8% arpen, flat ad and ap, spellsword, and 2 points in flat arpen. 9/21/0 is also viable since defense tree is op, but your goal is to dominate your lane so only go defensive if it's a hard matchup (vs Teemo for instance). A 16/14/0 setup to get the flat AP in offense and Block in defense can be a good balance against pesky ranged champions.

Skill order is R &gt; E &gt; Q &gt; W. You can safely skip leveling W until midgame unless you're up against someone like Riven with predictable

Always keep three things in mind as Tryn: you do more damage lower on health, the bonus heal from fury grows negligible compared to the base amount so you should try to keep your fury up for crit whenever possible.

The best trick I've learned for kicking ass with AP Tryn is to know when to spin *onto* an enemy and when to run into melee range and spin *away*. If you have high Fury

Items: my core is, you can grab Deathcap or Lichbane: I prefer Cap because it quite simply makes you even better at what you're already great at, but Lich makes you a better duelist and objective taker.   Personally I find that the lack of mpen and having to use Q at suboptimal times makes Lich less powerful than it seems but I'll reserve judgment on that. After, try Guinsoo for more sustained dps and pushing power, Warmogs as a big fuck you to anyone trying to kill you, or Twin Shadows to stay safe while you split. You may need Last Whisper to keep your damage up if they stack armor but I haven't had a chance to test that.

Playstyle-wise your goal is to bully hard, you're still a melee range fighter and are prone to being outscaled and outdueled. A bad start is very hard to come back from since all you can do is hope to keep up at that point, so don't play him like he's idiot proof. If you take a lead though, you can force their jungler to camp top fruitlessly while the rest of your team thrives. Keep tabs on their jungler and shove &gt; steal camps when he's bot or dead. Your roaming is poor so staying top to keep the pressure up is generally going to be your best course of action.

1345672573.0,ynt0w,Couple of tips for those of you jungling Rengar ,Kraz226,44,7,21,"**CTRL+F FOR TL;DR BELOW** 

I've played him a fair amount on PBE

*SKILL ORDER*

The main thing is that you actually do not max your Q first. The AD/AS buff on your Q is mediocre despite the good AD scaling, and gank monster. Rengar can do well in both roles due to his passive and decent clear speeds. 

*ITEMS* 

Item builds can differ, and neither costs a large amount of gold. Also, be sure to pick up the Bonetooth Necklace early on. It's an extremely good item that doesn't lose many stacks on death, so even if you're dying as long as you're team fighting well you'll get stacks up in no time. It's extremely gold efficient for all the stats it gives at only 6 stacks (25 movement speed, 10 armor pen, 5% cdr). 

* My setup: Armor/5pots &gt; Bonetooth and Vamp Scepter &gt; Tabis and Heart of Gold &gt; Brutalizer and Phage &gt; Zeke's (From here just build what you think is best against enemy team)

I usually try to get Randuins and Maw as my main defensive items. Bonetooth is a must and almost everything else is up to you. Brutalizer/Youmoo's is quite good, it was *awesome* how well the active/AD/spellvamp synergized with Rengar's kit, but it's pretty pricey for what it does. I want to try it out some more, I think it works well. Also, just about every single type of boot works on Rengar. I've done well with Ionian, Mercs, Tabis, and even Mobility boots. Mercs are usually the ones I stick with

*GAMEPLAY TIPS*

* When farming camps, and you'll take almost no damage at all due to the heal and armor buff you receive.

* When ganking, you can keep people almost permaslowed while you and your lane partner beat on them. 

* During teamfights you have to really try to do one of two things: focus their carry or protect yours. Rengar can really destroy most bruisers in the game since he can slow them and his armor pen lets him shred people who usually have a good chunk of armor. 

* Don't rely on your ult to reposition yourself

* Rengar can absolutely *maul* anyone he catches alone in the jungle/river. He's a fantastic champ when going against counter junglers (Udyr/Mundo/Shyvana) since he can stick to them easily while buffing his own tankiness at the same time. Ward your jungle entrances and chase down anyone who dares walk around alone. You can easily stack your Bonetooth while getting the enemy jungle behind by doing this. 

* This also applies to enemy mids who like to roam and get kills or farm wraiths (LeBlanc, TF, Gragas). If you know the enemy mid laner is going to try to gank and roam, lay down a ward or two so you can catch them with your own preemptive gank. 

* Rengar's early clear is slow

**TL;DR**

Jungling Rengar? Don't max Q first. Max W if you're just farming, and AD. Don't get wriggles, *do* get Bonetooth. Either focus carries or peel for yours. You rule small jungle skirmishes, keep jungle entrances warded and leap on anyone you catch out of position. You snowball really hard if you get stacks early, abuse this and keep on the offensive.

1344890864.0,y5wna,Orianna = Best Ap?,AlgorithimGaming,43,6,116,"Initially I bought Orianna because I never saw her played and I wanted to have a champion that no one else would really ever use. After playing her for a while realized that she is Anivia tier in terms of her entire kit.
She does everything that you would want an AP mid to do + more.

She has AP enhanced auto attacks so she can actually win simple trades in lane, meaning that you can actually make good use of this passive. This also allows you to go AD if you feel like it because she has Kennen's range, A free BF Sword's worth of damage late game, and a very solid attack animation.

She has a powerful, is able to check bushes, and provides sustained damage in teamfights. The huge range on this means that you usually won't need to put yourself in too much danger while still being a huge threat to the enemy team.

Next is a AOE nuke that gives your allies a haste

Her last basic skill is a shield with about 1000 range, and provides free magic resist and armor. If you don't have any allies of course it can be used on yourself to mitigate damage as effectively as Janna.

Her ultimate is an inverse Gragas ultimate with a strong nuke added into it. The range on it is pretty decent so it isn't impossible to consistently set up 3-4 enemies into getting hit by it. It also leads into your Dissonance burst followed by an Attack and maybe a Protect with good ball placement.

All of her damage is aoe

In lanes she is difficult to gank because she has a free ward that can remain in place for as long as she feels like

She farms very easily and can outfarm most mid laners even when being zoned. On that note

Late game she can easily take out Ad carries without even being at risk of counter attack. Attack, Attack, Protect can remove a carry from a fight with ease.

She has great ganks because of her slow

The only two problems anyone can really have with her are:

She is too mana dependent. This is something that I have personally had a bit of trouble with in the past. I used to build Archangel's on her, all you need is a Chalice and good mana management. It is much better to build damage on her than to rush a Tear and later build it into Archangels, though I can imagine very few situation where this might be viable. I used to max Q on her both before and after the changes, and I have recently started maxing W instead. I have realized that there is no point in maxing the positioning skill when you can do nothing after you have gotten the very important position that you wanted so badly. While her Q doesn't scale in mana cost anymore, it deals a lot less damage, and when you are trying to all-in someone, you are obligated to use Dissonance otherwise you know that you are doing much less damage than you could be. When you max it first you notice that you don't feel very bad about using the positioning skill simply to position your real damage skill, and usually they still can even clear until they have a few points in another skill. I used to max Protect last
Kinda of strange to max Q last because capitalizing on every possible advantage with Orianna is key

The next issue with Orianna is that she is a difficult champion to learn and master. I have no argument against this. I personally didn't have much trouble picking up her skills and using them effectively
Like Cassiopeia (The champ she is tied for in difficultly) If you aren't landing stuff then you are not doing anything.

If people would really put some serious time into Orianna they would realize that she is a serious threat to any enemy

1344374868.0,xuf7a,Interesting nunu-based teamcomp,mot88,46,6,53,"Since the recent nunu buffs, nunu could take advantage of his ability to jungle on the wraith camps.

Here is an example comp with this strategy:
1v2 bot lane (im not an expert on 1v2's, or cho'gath (?))
2v1 mid (nunu and miss fortune)
Udyr jungle 
Gragas

With this comp, nunu can take udyr's first wraith camp (which udyr's often skip) and udyr will be ready for a level 3 double buff gank.  

This strategy allows the team to maximize experience in the super-early game, nunu's bloodboil, and udyr's bear stance allow for a lot of movement speed, especially if the 2v1 is ap janna).  In addition, nunu is free to roam, because the ad carry can just 1v1 mid. This allows for the potential for a 5-6 minute 2 man dragon (nunu can solo dragon with the right build at level 4).

If nothing goes horribly wrong with this strategy, stealing the enemy jungler's farm, ganking top, and/or getting an early dragon.  This way, the ad will be ahead on xp compared to the enemy ap, the jungler will outfarm the enemy jungler, and nunu will have more gold then the enemy support (but possibly be underleveled) at the expense of an underfarmed bot lane.

tl;dr nunu support is underutilized in bot lane

███ Unconventional Team Composition and  Ideas  ███

▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬*Note*▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬

Not all of these ideas are mine but maybe have been done before in tournaments or games i have played in. Some of these i have thought of may have been found by someone else before.

If you want to leave a comment, team compositions, etc.

▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬Introduction▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬

**Please do not use these ideas if you're in a solo queue and your team is not willing to corporate - in other words

Team comps are very important to how the meta works in league and every champion that are picked is also important and every champion picked should fit into the team composition. The champions picked should either improve or fit into the strategy that is chosen. Another note to take is that when you pick a certain team/lane comp

▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬META▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬

▀█▄▌ Push Meta ▐▀█▄
Seriously. People used to say that there is no such thing as a push meta and oooh boy they were wrong. People thought dota 2 had no meta as well. They had, you would be saying ""But Vertical! Why are you using Dota 2 as an example? It's completely different from League!"".It is in fact different but the reason why i'm talking to you about it is that people want something new. For example, a rising popular high-elo player named Azingy is bringing in new tactics, his reasons. I don't know. But i respect him for attempting to introduce new aspects into league and he's been testing out many metas such as the tri-bot lane. Dota 2 or Valve doesn't instantly remove really OP tactics like how riot pretty much instantly nerfed ""protect the kog'maw"" team composition after it was re-introduced by Dignatas. Dota 2 undeniably more flexibility in team compositions.

The push meta is effective simply because it is hard to be outpushed by a pushing team, Cho Gath, Corki, etc. 


A very good example is a recent game of LGN vs CLG.NA(or Prime) where CLG picked the push meta. LGN had LOADS of problems getting split pushed but thankfully they picked a team composition that somewhat pushes them back a bit. It worked very well for CLG because it doesn't matter if LGN got dragon or anything
 
ε Top : Olaf (Flash/teleport)

ε Mid : Gragas (Flash/teleport)

ε Jungle : Mundo (Flash/Smite)

ε Bot : Sivir (Flash/teleport)

ε Support : Sona (Flash/promote) 

Notice how 4/5 of are EXTREMELY good pushers?(Except Sona) They would constantly pressure onto a tower. When they had the advantage in pushing a lane



▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬Team Compositions▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬


▀█▄▌ AD/Support Mid lane ▐▀█▄

ε Top : Any good top champs

ε Mid : AD

ε Jungle : Any

ε Bot : Can 1v2 or sustain a lot

ε Support : Check Description 


Description : Please note that this team composition will be hard to work with and requires a well coordinated team to do. Also this is listed in team composition because it completely changes the team comp.


This team composition can work because of the overall tactics. I've seen this work in Dota 2 tournaments effectively. This team composition still allows you to keep a strong control over dragon
The chances of the enemy counter jungling without dying are dramatically reduced giving the duo mid lane team slightly more advantage. 
AD carry /has/ to go mid because you simply cannot have an AD carry on bot by himself. He will be zoned and killed easily. 
A big disdvantage is that you will be having a possible 1v3 (including enemy jungler) bot if they focus on this weak point. This can be somewhat enhanced if team jungler roams around the bot lane side of the jungle
For support


A popular team in Southeast Asia named SAJ uses this and has some good success with it. They had a jungler and what they're doing is that they picked Karthus to lane against Graves &amp; Taric because Karthus can CS safely. While in mid lane it was Ezreal and Leona shutting down a Kassadin who needs quite a bit of farm to be useful.


Good article on it by DrCytoKinesis of Reddit: http://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/tl4ji/duo_lane_mid_strictly_superior_to_bottom_and_the/


""tl;dr Running ad/support mid lane is a strictly better position to run them than anywhere else on the map. They should always be mid. Tri-lane should be used for aggressive games/teams and there is no reason it should not belong in the current meta. It is a direct counter to the current farm-fest meta and it is a miracle that it isn't used. And to clarify

-------

▀█▄▌ (Pratically AOE)Galio/Kayle &amp; Fiddle ▐▀█▄

ε Top : Galio/Kayle

ε Mid : Fiddle

ε Jungle : Preferably AD tanky DPS 

ε Bot : Any AD carry 

ε Support :Preferably that can AOE stun - E.G : Shen, 

Description : Note* Since Fiddle isn't going to jungle

A perfect Galio taunt that is followed up by Fiddle can be extremely dangerous. Also while Galio ulted into the enemy team
The support preferably should be AOE stun so that galio can follow up. It will also provide easier ganks for fiddlesticks.
Also
Kayle is also a good pick in combination of how he was recently discovered that he was good with Karthus. Kayle shielded him while he did damage amongst a very wide range which fiddle can do as well and that he should. The ult provides him to take less damage but note that he can still be CC'ed in the shield. 

-------

▀█▄▌ Double AP / AP + Support Bot ▐▀█▄

ε Top : Any - but preferably Tanky AP that involves spell vamping - E.G : Vlad

ε Mid : AD carry that can solo against AD - E.G : Ashe, Urgot

ε Jungle : Any - Preferably Tanky AD

ε Bot : Mana AP Carry ( Escapes or something similar ) - E.G: Ahri

ε Support : Soraka

or

ε Bot : Mobility / Manaless AP Carry - E.G: Vladimir, Katarina  

ε Support : Lulu  

Description : This comp allows a bit of change and is similar to the old ""ad mid"" comp. I have tested this comp before with me as Ahri bot with soraka support and an urgot mid. What this comp allows you to do rather than sending the AP mid

When you decide your AP carry, a champion like Morgana could possibly prevent both the AP and Support to safely go back to tower if you are being ganked. Ahri provides mobility, Vladimir can pool to a far distance (not too far), Kennen has lightning rush, etc.

If you're choosing a mana reliant champion
If you're choosing manaless (energy, Lulu is the way to go because you don't need mana and you get the extra health boosts, damage boost and speed.

The two last were : 

- Her W lasts 6 seconds instead of 5 (Huge buff there)

- She has more Armor early

There are two types of players towards Sejuani :

- The player who don't play her because ""Yeah this pig sucks I don't want to try"" 

- The player who player her because they know her strength and succeed with her.

I swear that you should try her. She is really really really under-estimated and she should have a better reputation.

She has everything, scales with HP, slows more than everyone and has one of the best ult in the game.

Just **LEARN** to play her. If you have any questions

**Pros**: Deny farm to your lane opponent  
Incredible targeted poke  
Sustain for days  
Consistent farm-independent utility  
Crazy buff/objective control  
Resilient to burst  
Huge variety of viable build paths  
Can safely donate blue as a mid laner for most of the game  
Extremely strong vs. autoattack-focused champions

**Cons**: Low dmg output except for unreliable ult  
No instant escape  
Mana hungry  
Lategame impact is dependent on your adc to make the most use of blood boil

Nunu is a huge lane bully. Built and played properly

**Masteries**: 16/14/0

**Runes**: Mpen reds (AD/hybrid pen/armor viable but very situational and not recommended)  
Armor yellows (hp/lvl
Mr blues (mr/lvl
AP quints (Spellvamp viable vs low to no sustain but very high dmg lanes) 

**Items**: flask/ward/5pot with a focus on mana potions (1/4 or 2/3 vs heavy early harass) in most cases. Flask/2ward/2pot and flask/charm or bead/2pot viable in some situations.

Nunu is all about building to adapt. Triple AD comp? Glacial into Aegis or Banner and finishing with FH will give you your much-needed armor and utility to boot. Getting fucked by slows? Swiftness boots are your friend. Taking lots of poke? Grab Revolver and Visage and h4h4h4h4 back up to full health. Crushing your lane early? Double Doran's Ring and sorc shoes will let you keep the pressure up. Even Banner of Command and Ohmwrecker are great on Nunu simply because he has such a wide variety of stats that work well on him. Striking a good balance is the key to making solo Nunu work. Too much AP and your teamfight potential will be risky at best due to your low range and unreliable ult. Forego it entirely and you'll have practically no presence midgame. You want to be tanky enough to thrive on the frontlines

God tier: CDR.  
CDR is the single best stat you can get on Nunu. With 40% CDR, sustain, and gives you more leeway to use your ult 'imperfectly' (clearing waves, zoning, forcing flash) since you're less restricted by the long cooldown on its lower ranks. Further, since AP and magic pen don't improve Consume's damage output, it's far and away the best stat for baron and dragon control. An early glacial will let you solo dragon as soon as you can buy it; Glacial + Revolver + a second source of CDR (blue buff, blue elixir, Stark's, the 6% from utility

High tier: AP
AP improves your damage output with a 1.0 ratio on Ice Blast and up to 2.5 (!!) ratio on Absolute Zero, Varus, etc. to keep them from running), but you should almost always pick some up for lane/midgame to emphasize your poke and presence. Resistances are tops bloobie on Nunu because he has a shitload of HP (~75th percentile at lvl 1 and the highest hp/lvl and lvl 18 hp in the game by a wide margin) and since sustain heals damages after resistances, it emphasizes the effect of your consume. Armor is crucial even against AP-heavy compositions because it affects how well you can poke under towers, dive/zone the ADC, and tank Baron. Mana and manareg are crucial on Nunu because he's very mana-hungry and emphasizing CDR especially will oom him quickly in extended engages. How much you need though is a different question entirely. It's a balance between several different factors, how well you're controlling the creep line--being able to freely autoattack and have your passive up for most of your snowballs is a big deal) and how long it takes you to chip away at your opponent's HP through his built-in sustain and supply of potions. You also want to stay above an emergency threshold of ~200 mana to pop your Consume, Chalice (into a lategame Athene's or Mikael's), Shard of True Ice

Mid tier: HP, Magic Pen.  
HP is obviously great for keeping Nunu tanky and burst-resistant, and that's 2650 you could've spent toward capping your CDR. Utility and spellvamp are down here in mid tier because although they're very useful, they're not universally useful the way the primary stats are. Revolver is a great midgame pickup, and is probably the best investment after glacial shroud toward soloing baron, but you don't need it if you're not utilizing the combat sustain in teamfights. SV quints and the mastery are obviously stupendous, but they come at a steep cost to earlygame domination. How much utility you get is dependent on several factors: how well your ADC is doing (grab a Stark's if he's snowballing and help him tear shit up), the distribution of incoming damage (double AP steamrolling you in teamfights? Rush that Bulwark!), but that's nearly a chain vest or kindlegem or blasting wand. You don't want to rush it in lane (unless you're getting camped and falling behind), unlike someone like Swain or Singed or Kayle who can apply it over a large area and a long period of time. Coordinate with your support to cover a wide variety of auras 

Low tier: AD, %mvspd, On-hit (everything else)  
You aren't a bruiser. You aren't a melee carry. You have an aspd buff and nothing else. Your pressure on their ADC comes from your ability to snowball them, tank, and support-styled alternatives. Ravenous Hydra is fun for split pushing, but you're much better off grabbing a Banner of Command since it includes stats you can actually use in teamfights. Not much to really say here.

Boots: Sorc boots are your go-to choice for snowballing your lane if you feel secure in an offensive position. Swiftness are probably your strongest choices overall, but 2 people smacking on you continuously with reapplied slows will fuck your shit up! Up against Darius with Olaf in the jungle? Grab those Swifties if you know what's good for you. Tabi and Mercs are situational choices against heavy AD and AP/CC respectively. In terms of enchants, I think Alacrity is generally the safest choice you can make. Mobility and positioning is big on a short ranged champ with no blink, a % based movespeed boost, a need to stay in range of multiple targets on both teams to apply his buffs, a point blank AoE which is very timing-sensitive, and a combat heal that only works in range of minions. The time between needing to cast consume and actually getting the heal is as long as it takes you to get to a minion. It really adds up. Distortion is great if you choose to go tele/flash and focus on map presence

**Skills:** In general, trade in melee, and ensure a kill if your jungler ganks early. They can flash all they want from an Olaf with BB and ghost--they aren't getting away.

You almost always want to max Q second--at lvl 5 vs lvl 1, and healing for 175% more. That's 3.6x the total DPS and **5.5x** the total healing compared to lvl 1 which is way more than you get from maxing most spells. Add in CDR, AP, and Vamp and it's no wonder you can solo baron so easily with a pittance of gold at lvl 13. Keep in mind that while spell vamp on magic damage is calculated after resistances, Consume deals TRUE damage and will heal you based on its rank and your AP and spell vamp without resistances coming into play, making for a huge combat heal that scales throughout the entire game. The only exception is if you're seriously dominating the midgame and you want to max blood boil to keep your ADC snowballing for early pushes and finish the game quickly. Obviously you'll want to max BB more if your ADC is Vayne than if it's Ezreal, but again it's a judgement call.

Know how to use your spells. Consume should be used on cooldown as long as you can benefit from the heal. Blood boil should be up on the ADC constantly, serve as an emergency mvspd/aspd slow, cleanup when their interrupts are dead or on cooldown, clear waves, heal you with spellvamp, and chunk Baron/Dragon. Always hop into a bush if it doesn't adversely affect your positioning too much.

**Summoners**: Flash is pretty much mandatory since you have no instant reposition, I run ignite 90% of the time for early dominance and kill potential, especially during a gank. Exhaust and Teleport are the two best alternate options, Exhaust being great for lategame control (since you're more likely to get in range to exhaust their ADC than a support like Janna or Sona who needs to maintain range) and Teleport for split pushing, particularly with Distortion boots and Banner of Command.",,False,t5_2smhl,True

That being said, and finally nerfing her gap close ability. To top it all off, Spirit of the Lizard Elder (basically her core item) has seen multiple nerfs due to its popularity with laners. Despite all of this, I still find Vi a very strong, albeit underplayed pick.

In patch 3.10, the recent jungle spawn changes enable certain junglers to eke out a bit more farm through speedclearing camps. I find playing Vi this patch to be surprisingly powerful when taking advantage of the 3.10 and jungle changes.

Personally, and her midgame teamfighting very scary. Specifically, I build:

* Start: Long Sword
* First Back: Vampiric Scepter, Wards
* Core: Blade of the Ruined King, Tabi/Mercs
* Mid Game: Spirit Visage
* Late Game: Trinity Force

Vi clears extremely fast (using Q to hop walls allows her to take advantage of the increased spawn frequency) and has innate sustain with her blast shield, which with your ult is a guaranteed kill, even with minimal help from a laner.

In the mid-game, and grabbing a Warden's Mail on top of that gives a powerful blend of resistances, HP, and CDR. Because 3.10 has increased the efficiency of Spirit Visage and lowered the cost of Warden's Mail, Vi can afford to itemize both damage and tankiness and still be an effective initiator even without substantial farm.

In the late game, bringing Vi neatly to the 40% CDR cap.

Although Vi might not be meta per se

I know there are other Vi fans out there; how do you guys build her? Do you still go for the early Lizard Elder? Do you go the tank route and grab an early SotAG? Do you play her in lane? Any innovative new builds you've come up with? Is her low pick rate justified or is it due to players instinctively jumping ship when she got nerfed?

So what solution

&gt;**Reducing early game pressure**

&gt;Season Two opened up more opportunities for junglers to create early game action through ganking lanes. Although this had an overall positive effect on the game

That last line, and the holy trinity: Graves, Ezreal, Corki. This wasn't listed above because it's not really the topic of the thread, and can cause a lot of arguing.

Players like Aphromoo are also helping shift the meta. Once tournaments run on the nerfed Ezreal patch, and Varus have also seen some competitive play (in part due to Aphromoo).

So, is it better to just ward River Bush, or should I ward that area between tribush and river bush (on the corner outside of Dragon Pit)? Also, later in the game, what's the best way to go about warding. I have a Ruby Sightstone, but when I'm at full-build, should I always leave an extra item slot open to buy more sight/vision wards? Would that be a detriment against getting an item that can help me engage more/help my team more?

3. Sacrificing. How worth it is it to sacrifice myself for other champs? I know that when doing it for a champ that's fed/on a streak

4. Who are truly the best support champs? Again, and then you have have CC monsters like Leona and Alistar, and healing champs like Soraka, Sona, and Taric. Some of these champs mix into the other categories much more too, but I'm just emphasizing certain abilities of these champs for the time being. So based on what I want to get out of support (whether aggressive, CC master, etc.)

5. Whenever I played ranked games, and helping them harass in bot, but it just doesn't take. Don't get me wrong, I completely admit that I have terrible gameplay many times. But, I've also had games where I'm doing the best I truly can as a support, and it just doesn't take. So, with that being said, and I feel that a proper explanation of this, would help me out a lot.

I know this is a big post, if you have references to vids/guides that you found useful, that's fine, but I'd prefer your own personal experience much more, as it's easier for me to learn through more direct examples.

What if a team capitalized on this by swapping a lane with the jungle for the first few levels? whoever would start the jungle would probably be the one taking smite

one obvious disadvantage i can see is that you have a laner stuck with smite but that can still be used well - smiting cannon minions to help push the lane faster.

it would also probably require pre-game prep to have appropriate rune and mastery pages configured as well.

edit2: Thinking about it a bit more, I'm willing to concede that AD items may not be necessary

Y'all read the topic title  and you already think I'm crazy.  I encourage you to read past that and just hear me out.

Let it be known, irelia, darius maybe, even a vayne on bottom in despite being a completely different lane.  True damage kinda sucks for an armor fiend.)

Let's state some facts here

* Tarics kit *can* be a very offensive one.  His passive can keep his mana high
* Taric has the highest level 1 base AD in the game.  If you roll 21 in offense and have full AD reds/quints, too.  90 AD last hitting (with a super responsive auto attack) at level 1 is a godsend, and you get tons of mana for it from your passive.  You can win early pokes/trades with other melee champions early game with this alone (though his attack speed sucks, so don't fully commit until you're ready to spike somebody.)
* Insane lane clearing with his W (especially if you chain it with Iceborn Gauntlet.)
* Even if his kit doesn't scale off AD, so he will get some AP scaling nonetheless.

Inspired by a recent thread, frankly, I do better with Darius.)  I'm not a high Elo player, but regardless, people underestimated him all the time.  However, as the metagame shifts, we see champions being played in nontraditional lanes all the time.  Why not Taric?  Why is he resigned to bottom lane?

I'm running 21/6/3 masteries, with Flash/mana regen in utility.  Flat damage reds/quints, armor yellows and MR/lvl blues.

I'm still thinking about the items, Gunblade, Black Cleaver, Spirit Visage and Guardian Angel~~.  Running the numbers, here's what his stats are at level 18 with full gear. *edit: nevermind, i've been enlightened.

* ~~216~~ AD (+70 from Ult
* ~~123~~ AP (+70 from Ult) (higher
* ~2500 HP.  Somewhat low for a bruiser, frequent self-heals.
* With spirit visage and ult on
* With 40% CDR, allowing you to spam heals and sheen procs.
* With 40% CDR, even, if it's a long one.
* In fact
* With Frozen Fist, not to mention your heal spam.

Do other people do more damage?  Yes

Late game, heal spam and slew of slows, you *might* even be able to stand toe to toe with certain ADCs (those without escapes, anyway.)

I'm by no means saying ""everybody should play Hybrid Taric, I do think he's worthy of consideration in certain team comps/matchups.  If you're facing a champion with little/no escapes (even some AP champions, if you rush Visage) he has significant burst potential.

2) sustain: can refill health to full unless interrupted. Even then he has probably filled about a quarter of it

3) AA: wuju style basically gives him a free BF sword

4) free escape ult.


Obviously, 1 second isn't going to matter in the trade. If you use it to stop the meditate, he will simply close knowing that now the trade is in his favor.

First, the mid game forcing, the lane swaping, etc. that became common in all regions since the godly asswhoping TSM had on MLG. Every team shifted to that playstyle, because you either play Anivia and stall the game to the next Eon (making her, probably, the natural counter to the Korean meta)

Skarner without a very very good peeler, disabling a key member. This meta likes teamfights and forces them, in order to snowball even harder.

They are in advantage and a team fight is imminent, pop ulti, reduce damage. His ultimate is of an absurd utility in this agressive metagame because it works both ways, making it easier to siege a turret and to fight a snowballed team.

1343626631.0,xdmvt,Nunu - So strong now?,thekidsaremad,40,3,26,"EDIT: glad to see the pros have also picked up on his strength

So I started using nunu again after seeing OddOne playing him after his buffs, but nunu can jungle (and effectively!) while running this setup. He doesn't face lane pressure to exploit it and he doesn't need the speed/tanking/dmg other junglers need to get rolling from the runes/masteries. His skills scale very well, and he can just get super tanky mid-late game from his huge gold income. 

 Pros:
- Crazy gold income

- Early game counter jungling is huge, blood boil + eat + smite their red then gank with level 3. You take bloodboil level 2 to counter jungle for mobility, worst comes to worst you can run away without using flash often. 

- His ganks are very strong due to the fact that he can just spam ganks due to his bloodboil

- He can use his speed to provide all sorts of support

- His consume is a great fall back

- Late game he really shines

- Massive peel

- His ult is also great for ganks

- He doesn't need dps items so he can afford to buy things like randuins/frozen heart/reverie/etc and he's guaranteed the gold due to his GP5 setup.

- Can cover and counter pressure lanes, heal off a minion, snowball them, run around, etc. His speed makes this less of a setback, plus gp5. Seems most junglers don't understand counter pressure, if you run in and make their mid use half their mana you've helped your team mate at least get the cs while you pressure. 

Cons: 
- He doesn't have ""hard cc"" - but the fact is that he has 2 reliable slows + the ability to make him and his ally significantly faster. 

- If they attempt to counter pick your strategy you may lose if you don't know how to adapt

- If your team isn't with you it might make life hard, react to objectives (dragon + buff steals are big for nunu), or help you if you get caught in the jungle you might get set back.

1328909642.0,pjx0a,[[Playing Kog'Maw]] + Support Friends,PaulWeiner,38,5,6,"**Overview:**

The purpose of this post is to help you learn to play Kog'Maw. This post will focus on the lane-phase


**How to Play Kog in lane:**

Kog'maw's strength in lane comes from his ability to consistently land his long-range auto attacks and ultimate.  In order to be successful as Kog'Maw you **need to master the orb walk** and *need to be aggressive with your range*.  This means taking the time to walk forward and right click.  

If your W is off CD, mirror their movement, moving backwards. When they change their mind and turn around, follow and hit them with another auto-attack.  You can repeat this until your W wears off.  

However

First, but more often than not I will buy 2-5 wards within the first 20 minutes to help the team (mostly myself).

Second, walk backwards until they stop chasing, at which point you activate your W and shoot them as they walk backwards to the safety of a minion wave, tower or brush.

Oftentimes

1. Importance of movement speed
2. How to turn enemy ganks into kills for you

Movement speed is arguably the most critical stat on Kog'Maw for two reasons.  Defensively, a MS advantage means you can easily land free damage upon activation of your W.  Obviously, this dependence on movement speed makes boots as your first item a no-brainer (and zerkers/zeal also strong early items).

Now when the time comes, aka your slow vomit path, which should be leveled after your R and W.

There are a few ways to use this spell.  Ideally, when running away, it's better to throw it down in front of your path, rather than toward/in-front of your enemies.

When using it offensively it's good to aim it in a way that creates a path of vomit perpendicular to the lane (as opposed to in line with it) ensuring it's tough to dodge/ignore.  The area of effect was recently buffed making it significantly more effective at sticking enemies in place.  Don't rush to cast this spell.  It's most effective if it catches enemies well within your range.  

For example if an udyr (or similar melee ganker) tries to close the gap, then active W, turn AA-Q-E-AA slowing his current position, escape path, and the path of any friends who might be following.

Stay aggressive in these scenarios.  A Kog'Maw doing his thing in lane is really frustrating and other AD carries/supports will often get over-zealous when his jungle has just come to gank and will often step way out of position giving you free kills if you're ready to capitalize.  

**Lane Control and Supports:**

The most important skill to master as Kog'Maw is controlling the position of the lane to minimize your opponents opportunities to initiate on you.  You do not want to give them an opportunity to use the brush offensively.  Champions like alistar

You may need to tell your support to maintain brush vision if he's failing to properly support you.  This is specifically important if the lane is being pushed to right outside of your tower range

Oftentimes, focus on denying your enemy by harassing him under the tower.

Don't be in a rush to take the tower

At early levels, Cait, Ashe, etc.), you will have to spend most of your time Auto attacking the creep to keep from being pushed into your tower, or into a bad position. 

Some of the best support combos with Kog'Maw are as follows:

Soraka: Allows for more liberal skill usage, but most importantly, keeps your enemy from getting her.  Soraka is the bane of your existence in the lane phase, because she'll cut the damage of all your abilities with her passive, and nullify most of your poke.  

Janna:  Passive Movement speed bonus makes doing ""Kog'Maw"" things like finishing a fleeing enemy with R, her AD bonus encourages you to build an early zeal, after zerks. Her knock up is amazing for defensive purposes.  The lack of sustain shouldn't hurt you, just be aware of HP advantage and use potions to keep your hp up.

Nunu: Great initiation and blood boil is made for Kog'maw.  Also, it's great to let Nunu stack his passive as well (filling in one of your weaknesses).  

Taric:  Pick when you're against Vayne.  If she tumbles in, so his shatter isn't as useful with Kog, but he also has good bush control.  Taric is also a decent pick versus Soraka, because at level 6, your combined burst can usually kill her, especially if you force her to use her heal on the carry right before hand.

Sona: Strong support, in my experience.  That being said, her Q gives bonuses to AD and AP, which Kog'Maw can utilize better than most, because his W and R scale off of both stats.


Hopefully this helps some aspiring Kog'Maw players.  Best of luck!",,t5_2smhl,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/LeagueofLegendsMeta/comments/pjx0a/playing_kogmaw_support_friends/

1371275457.0,1gdyai,The Solo Queue Playbook: Simple Strategies for Success; part 2 (early laning phase),BlueNoseReindeer,40,5,14,"Yesterday I talked about [L1 strats] (http://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/1g81my/the_solo_queue_playbook_simple_strategies_for/) which can help your team get off on the right foot, levels 1-5.

**During the early laning phase the most important person is the jungler.** Simply put, you need to understand how each jungler works.

* **Usually** Non-Mainstream junglers like Yi, are rare because they lack early ganking potential unless their enemy is seriously mispositioned. If you have one of these junglers on your team, odds are early ganks aren't going to be successful unless the enemy is pushing hard without ward coverage.

* Snowbally Assassin Junglers like Shaco and Lee Sin, you should be prepared.

* General junglers, and Sej usually look to start ganking around level 3-4 to gank. Make sure you know how each jungler's ganks work so that you can best avoid them.

These are general outlines to give you some context of when junglers hit power levels if you hadn't thought about it before, I will almost always wait until level 4 to get my Nautilus hook when I am jungling, but many people will get it at Level 3, and some may even get it at level 2, depending on how much they want to force a gank.

Don't assume that just because you're going against an Amumu that he wont gank until he hits 4 (AKA: you should probably still get wards); if he can get a good gank off at L2 or L3 that will snowball a lane he's done his job, you can bait out early ganks/wasting time by playing *slightly* more passive. A Lee Sin walking through a ward means you should probably back off immediately (if he has flash he has 3 gapclosers, CC, AND strong burst even at L2 (if he started red), and that's not even considering his teammate(s) in the lane. A Malphite at L2 is significantly less imposing, and if you can get him to waste time thinking a gank opportunity will come up, or bait him into coming in when you are able to disengage (probably causing him to invest a point in his slow

On the same note, because if you can foil their plans early, you will (generally) be able to handle them easily late. For example, as Morgana Mid if my lane is pushing early I may get my shield at L2 or L3 instead of L4 like I prefer to, because I know without it I'm a death waiting to happen. The more factors there are to increase the success of a gank on me (factors like strength of the jungler currently, easy setup from lane opponent, and vision control) the more likely I am to invest in my shield when it comes times to allocate the skill point.

The summoner spell teleport, so I'll wait to discuss them in my next article.

Okay

1. **The Simple Gank.** Jungler gets in position, and don't set something up, so the jungler goes in without a setup and the gank fails. As a jungler, ping to let your teammate know you are there, it makes all the difference. As a laner, let your jungler know **ahead of time** to ping when he gets near, especially if this is a common problem for you (like it used to be for me). The second biggest problem with the simple gank is that sometimes it's not possible for some reason (e.g. the lane is pushed), set a limit on yourself for how long you will stay for a potential gank. As a laner, I could write a whole article on that, focus the person with the least escapes

2. **The Countergank.** One laner knows a gank is coming, this requires wards, and almost always requires a nearby ally (or global ult) that the enemy doesn't bring into their calculations. The key in counterganking is to anticipate their actions, and have your response ready. If you're Ez/Nami/Amumu against a Draven/Leona/Sej, you know that they will initiate with Draven's knock, Leona's pull, or Sej's dive. If you get hit by all of these things your counter won't go well (because you're dead), and mayhem from uncoordination (e.g. Amumu dives their tower while Ez stays back to farm) has a high chance of occurring. Once you get hit initiated on, and Nami heal/slowing shots/speedups, will be your only avantage

3. **Counterjungling.** Counterjungler invades jungler's jungle, Shaco), and at the 7:00 mark no matter what. The important thing to remember in counterjungling is that it isn't a one-man job. The team that is able to help their jungler faster will almost always come out on top of the engage, even if their jungler gets killed/loses a buff (e.g. if Nunu kills Naut, ending up with doublebuffs, but then dies to a laner, that laner will have doublebuffs, it is very easy with a ward to steal the first buff of a jungler with many champions, especially their jungler. Solo lanes start hitting L6 around this time, if the jungler started blue buff

4. **Sneaky Dragon.** This is a rare play, and if it is not possible then be highly aware of potential of the jungler to solo dragon (Nunu, Warwick, Nasus, and Shaco are a few who are very good at this) and keep track of the enemy botlane. If you think they are taking it, odds are you should fight them since dragon will weaken them substantially early on (and you can catch them between indecision and more indecision).

After that, but generally, the duo lane will go and farm against the enemy duo lane and the jungler will go back to farming the jungle and applying pressure around the map.

While watching the Tencent LPL (Chinese LCS)
Here's the game: http://tga.qq.com/act/a20130301pl/livecont.shtml?iProdId=93
At first, would run into lanes, dive under turret, and kill their enemies--in a similar fashion to M5's wandering Alistar/Lee Sin with an Urgot solo lane bot. Wings of Aurora start by doing a three man dive on Positive Energy's top lane, then they immediately take the turret. Up to this point, they are doing the strategy I previously mentioned.

Here's where Wings of Aurora diverts from the NA/EU standard. After taking the top turret, and Graves all go bot lane, and proceed to attempt to massacre PE's bot lane. It's important to note that Wings chose Gangplank and Karthus so they could apply massive global pressure on bot lane while Xin stayed down there. For a long time, League of Legends has had a lane setup of 1-1-2 with a jungler, but what about a 1-1-3 setup, or, as it was known in DotA, but he exerts pressure exclusively on his team's duo lane. I'm curious what other people think about this strategy

I guess the general goal of the Tri-Lane needs to be to shut down the opposing ADC and Support as much as possible, gives your whole team gold/exp, and sets you up to be ahead for the Tri-Lane. Then, when you get to the tri-lane vs duo lane you have a gold advantage and your solo lanes are closer to being level 6 (when they can start applying global pressure).

Now, I found this pick to be really interesting. I would note that Pantheon gets banned a lot in the LPL and against various teams, so I would assume that he has seeped his way into the Chinese metagame as a very aggressive support. Especially in a game where diving turrets is a big part of the game, Pantheon is fantastic, as he can tank more turret shots than any other champion at level 1 and 2 and has reliable, hard CC.

So the question I have is what do you guys think about the Tri-Lane and Pantheon support? I can say that just thinking about it, and he's proven himself in China. The thing about Pantheon support is that he really lends himself to a Tri-Lane strategy, so you can continuously dive their ADC and Support and shut them down. This made me re-evaluate the Tri-Lane, and it makes me think that it could be really effective, especially with Global presence like Karthus, Twisted Fate, Shen

I wonder if we'll see Pantheon support get picked up by any NA/EU teams. Basically all innovation in the support role has come from China/Korea, etc.). I think that Pantheon is going to be the next Elise support, especially if diving continues to be such a potent strategy.

Singed gets mana as health, Singed's whole thing is trolling the enemy team by escaping with just a sliver of health, baiting them to chase through his poison in hopes of getting a kill. What better way to bait and troll than by packing shields on top of his existing tankiness?

1353242377.0,13ea8m,Season 3 Shaco Analysis and Discussion,ItsBricksOutHere,37,4,23,"Hey LeagueofLegendsMeta

As soon as the Season 3 material hit the PBE

I have played quite a few games

**Masteries**: 21/9/0

**Runes**: AS Reds, MR/lvl Blues.

**Firstly

Shaco does very well in the new jungle. The typical route I followed was either Red-Wolves-Blue

Unfortunately in season 3, and the buffed wolves do not go down fast enough.

Despite this, then finish the other buff, you exit the jungle at level 3 around the same time as current standards.

Unlike most other junglers in season 3

In any case

On a really postive note, but he was a particular champ who had difficulty efficiently clearing until he got madreds/wriggles.

Ultimately

Now

Honestly

First

I legitimately think this item is broken on assassins. In Shaco's case

1. Attack Speed. Being single target

2. The Active. With Shaco's Q and SotD, SotD), Shaco need only Q to a squishy, aa, activate SotD, 3xaa, then finish them with E. He can honestly 100-0 most carries in a single rotation with these 4 crits

The new **Black Cleaver**: On hit builds, although Shaco cannot use it with his spells, I find that in small skirmishes with his clone, those 4 BC stacks are added very quickly. And while it lacks attack speed, the additional stats are everything that Shaco wants.

**Blade of the Ruined King**: Another absolutely amazing item. Again, this item is simply a must. The clone appiles the passive, so on a single target, you and your clone deal 8% HP for every AA together. (not to mention base damage or crits).~ If we forgo the 2%, Shaco can basically 100-0 anyone with only 10xAA from him and his clone together.~

**Guardian Angel**: Despite the nerfs

**End Notes:**

My typical end game build as of now is usually: Wriggles, BotRK, GA, Black Cleaver.

This build in particular gives amazing burst

Maw is still a very good option

I have also been playing around with the new Tiamat and and its upgrade. It is really nice to have in the jungle

A nice aspect is that you can Q into a team

**TL;DR** Shaco will love Season 3


So, critique, and discuss anything you have seen, tested, or think may be applicable to Shaco in season 3! Perhaps we may even see the rise of Shaco mid?

A Vi or Jayce early game, how important is an ADC in a solo Q really?

She may be one of the hardest champs to use properly, but her damage/utility is amazing. Being able to snipe people with stuns over a wall at like 1000 range (max distance) makes for epic plays when chasing and escaping, and her burst with ult is truly devastating to carries. Getting all the balls out before using it isn't usually necessary to burst someone because you can get a stun in at the same time and hit with a W to slow and then get some easy Q's in as well.

Questions though for who has been playing her. What's you're typical builds? I generally rush Athene's then go for Dcap/void for max burst.
Runes I use are generally ap quints, and cdr per level blues (because I like cdr over MR when I get athenes).

Mediocre player here (1100-1300 ELO). I've been building Varus slightly differently than the standard IE+PD+LW AD carry build since he came out

My first 21K gold always goes to the standard and safe 2 Dorans Blades

95% of the time, but that's rare. Once I have BC, Mal and BT; I sell my Dorans for a Quick Silver Sash, and finish the build off with a Phantom Dancer.

Final build looks like: QSS, BT, PD, BzG.

So to explain the method behind my madness:

1) Varus benefits very well from AS. It lets him get more W stacks on an enemy faster

2) In team fights, but with BC and Mal, I'm applying stacks of armor pen and magic pen. This causes me to do less damage on my own, but my team as a whole can melt down our target faster. Even tanky champs don't last very long (unless they have really heavy defenses like FH, Randuins and a SFC)

3) Varus does (a little) magic damage with each attack. I want to capitalize on this, 4 in defense for early armor and improved heal, and the rest into standard AD in the offence tree). 

So

**DISCALIMER** If I'm in a serious business game, or grab a different carry in champ select. Same if an enemy is really stacking the armor, I'll get LW so that I don't fall behind in damage.

This build is aimed towards the **fastest movespeed possible**
However

If their whole team chases me down chances are they *will* eventually manage to kill me

I feel that Flash isn't very versatile on the Crystal Scar, you'll have ghost, exhaust, your W, your shrooms, and Rylai's proc on your Q (which has a fairly good range). Let's not forget a two-second activation stealth mode that can drive. Them. Nuts.

As *jtiza* has pointed out in the comments, and Priscilla's) as well as those on your enemy-impairing moves (Exhaust, Blinding Dart and Shrooms (the latter two with Rylai's proc)) is crucial to your survival. I wouldn't recommend using W every time it's up just to traverse the map faster, unless you have superb map awareness - it may cost you a failed escape. The only thing you should be spamming whenever it's off-cooldown is your shrooms, preferably all over the map.

-

I feel that the two most important items for this build are **Boots of Mobility** and **Morello's Evil Tome**. They provide everything that you need

Next up are **Rylai's Crystal Scepter** (which honestly I'd consider as core) and Lich Bane for more damage

A suggestion that I saw coming up a lot in the comments is to include a **Priscilla's Blessing**. After thinking about it

If you don't find yourself to be sufficiently swift

To round out your damage to *really* annoying levels

-

**Early game**, then stealth and BP, repeat until 6. Make your enemy develop a hatred towards you, so that whenever you do pop up, they always go hunting for you. Waste their time as much as you can. And if they start ignoring you, make them pay for it. Instead of pretending to ninja cap, actually do it. That'll show 'em.

**Once you hit 6**, every time they'll try capping it the shroom poison will prevent them from channeling for a few seconds.

Shrooming -on- enemy nodes is pointless, starting from about 200 range from its circle, will benefit your team a lot. Shrooming friendly points is always a great idea.

And most importantly, frustrated players' testimonies.

One of two things will happen once you've started filling the map with your mushrooms.

In one scenario the enemy team will realize how much you're hindering their progress, because whether they succeed in doing that or don't, you've accomplished what you were trying to. They've left their points more vulnerable to captures.

In the other scenario, admittedly, not as great). It will give you the chance to shroom more, and if you feel for one moment that they don't give a fuck, go back to your early game habit of ninja capping their points. Either succeed and get a point, or fail but get them to waste resources hunting you down (bonus points if you escape).

Mind you this was with no lifesteal quints

Jungle Nasus early strength is the ability to push an immediate tower in the 2 v 1 lane. To counter this Jarvan cleared his buffs

The Dorans blade made him more efficient there against Nasus who took standard start (machete + pots) because of the lack of gold ""wasted"" on potions. They held out defending the tower and eventually Nintendude got first blood on EDward. 

This allowed him to go double dorans

What are your thoughts on the start?

Do you think it could be a decent counter to the tower pushing meta?

Does Nintendude building more damage recently show that Coast is improving and going away from just 'tank for Zion' mentality?

I'm interested in others thoughts on the double dorans start!

I personally believe Sivir's problems lie with her terrible base HP (considering her range) and her terrible mana costs.

Currently Sivir has a base HP of 378, and make it easier to try get a double hit at medium/close range where normally it's near impossible. The other part I would change would be to give her some lower mana costs with maybe a bit of a buff to her base HP. It can be hard farming with Sivir with just autos due to your shit range, and to make up for it you generally want to use your skills, but her shit base mana pool + fairly high cost means that you have to be a lot more conservative than I think she should have to be. My possible changes:

Base HP increased to 420.

Base mana pool increased to 250

Boomerang blade mana cost decreased to 60/65/70/75/80

Ricochet mana cost decreased to 30 at all levels

3. They require very little reliance items to scale.
4. They have some sort of poke/harass/engage/self sustain/trade abilities.

Twitch in particular will benefit from the S3 jungle remake, ward spam could just solidify the current tanky utility jungler meta as having an Oracle's holder who is not easy to kill becomes more important.

Bot lane will become a lot safer and thus more diverse when it comes to viable AD carries, both of who will be able to make great use of the new [Runaan's Hurricane](http://na.leagueoflegends.com/board/showthread.php?p=31408179#post31408179) item.

1352226611.0,12qpz9,Tri-Jungles or: How I learned to  stop worrying and love the gank,KingDunco,41,11,18,"Introduction:
I would like to preface this by mentioning that this strategy is in no way meant to be played in a ranked game
  
 The tri-jungle strategy is one that is very touchy by all means, and quick pushes.  Know that the strategy becomes less effective if you do not make the most of your early game advantage.  If you fail to take full advantage then you will quickly fall behind in the game.  

Team Comp:
Team comp is difficult to create for this strategy.  
There are a number of requirements that must be met:

* A quick clearing and safe bot laner(he will be playing 1v2)  Vlad works well

* A strong top lane champion that fits to go against their lane opponent(this and bottom should be picked last)

* A support style champion in the jungle(nunu is a very strong pick)

* A Movement speed champion with a fast clear to help maintain your empty lane

* A champion with hard cc(stuns

These guidelines must all be met and if possible there should two cc's and at least 1 dash in your composition.  Slows are also helpful in your jungle trio as they will guarantee your kills. Nunu excels in the support jungle role as he does not require smite

For bot lane characters that are traditional picks on a top and bottom lane switch are also viable in this composition.  The point is to put someone who can safely farm and push minions away from tower until the ganks are available from your jungle.  In my experience Vlad is a very strong pick for this as he can survive and push out quickly to avoid much damage to the tower.  When done correctly the early game farm period should not last for very long.  

The jungle group must be able to be split into 2, after all, you have no mid laner.  When done properly the mid lane kill should be guaranteed at level 1, as almost no one expects the 3 jungle gank to come from 2 sides, and they will undoubtedly be pushed past the mid point of the lane.  

Game Progression; Early Game:
As Previously stated this strategy gets weaker as the game goes on and so every stage of the game matters

 Moving on from the jungle the nearest lane should be a priority.  On blue side this will usually be the top lane, and damage the tower as much as you can with a best case scenario of taking the first tower of the game at this point.  

This is the point in the game that you need to make absolutely sure to keep the pressure on the rest of the map, to stop them from farming.  It is absolutely vital that you do not leave mid lane alone for any prolonged period of time, and remove their mid from lane as often as possible.  Once you have pushed back mid, or killed the lane opponent follow your 3rd jungler out of the jungle into the un-ganked lane.  If that lane is ungankable at this time then you should put as much damage onto mid lanes turret as possible and send your third jungle into the enemy jungle,  you should have 2 smites on your team so using one to take larger creeps is fine.  

At this point the first dragon of the game should be spawning soon

Game Progression; Mid and late game:

This is a point which is difficult to mark in the game.  I usually count the progression into mid game under when you have taken down the 3 outer towers and at least 1 dragon.  With the 190 gold from dragon and the 150x3 gold from the towers you should be at least 540 gold ahead and if you have managed to pick up any kills in your ganks rather than just pushing enemies out of the lane then your lead should be even more.  In this point you want to keep the pressure on your enemies.  Mid lane will be the obvious focus with at least 1 jungler taking camps or ganking at all times.  Staying in lane should only be done when you have the ability to push to a tower, and a significantly higher amount of map control.  From this point on in the game you must push hard to take towers and get every dragon possible.  Keep the enemies on the defensive and don't let them farm up.  You can control their resources and remove them from lane at will, and you should do this whenever possible.  

Conclusion:

This strategy is definitely not one for a ranked play, the largest being that you do not push the advantage given to you early game, and allow them to catch up to your team.  The 2nd risk is to allow the mid lane free farm.  The main counter that this strategy has to that is to gank often, and to have 1 jungler have a large movement speed buff.   Hecarim is great as he can get to the lane and clear it very quickly, and with a nunu also in the jungle he will get to any point in the map in no time.  I hope that this strategy is something that you can try for fun, as me and my friends have enjoyed it very much.

1351090427.0,120abr,Top Lane: Breaking the standard. ,Kraz226,53,25,45,"I'm tired of top lane being a horrible place where the jungler decides who wins and getting killed once is a death sentence. So I did some serious theory crafting and came up with a better overall strategy. Here are my thoughts. 

* Apply pressure. 
 
I started applying pressure on my enemy and their tower from level 1. Most enemies don't expect this and will try to either gank you or camp top. This is what you want to happen. Having the enemy jungler or mid constantly coming top will help keep them away from bot and dragon

* Play champs who are relevant from level 1 to level 18. 

My favorite picks so far are Shyvana, Hecarim, and Nidalee. Why? Because they can push a lane hard if needed with some form or Aoe, they all have some form of mobility and escape so they can get away from ganks, they all scale well when it comes to late game because of different reasons (Shyvana/Hecarim initiation, Gragas damage, Jayce helps team mobility

* Push always. 

If you are ever *not* pushing your lane you are doing it wrong. In this day and age of the game winning top means you are demanding the other team's attention at all times. You need to be doing something they are always trying to stop. If they choose to not come stop you? TAKE THEIR TOWERS ALL THE WAY TO THEIR INHIB. I've had at least 6 games playing Shyvana where I never stopped pushing the lane, and don't leave lane unless it's to help your team with objectives or defend. 

* Be tanky. 

You should always be reasonably tanky as a top laner these days. Usually with the emphasis on assassins and ADCs being the main damage of most teams you're going to be the person who should be in the middle of a fight. Shyvana and Hecarim excel at this role, it falls on you in most games. 

* Farm hard. 

Have some good AoE clear, and don't fall behind in farm. 

If the enemy freezes the lane? Fight them. Harass them. Get them to move and keep them on the defensive. It's not easy

* Don't pick to counter

Literally, it will not help you win the game since you will usually lack combos with your team. Example: You're facing Singed top and you decide to play Teemo since he does so well against Singed, you kill Singed a couple times and are doing great. That is, until Singed decides to Tele-gank bot and get dragon with his team after getting a double kill bot lane while you spent your time farming and trying to push. Now you're behind in gold and the enemy bot lane is starting to snowball because the champ you picked doesn't have the map presence that Singed does or any kind of synergy when the teamfights and roaming starts. 

If you want synergy


* Ward crucial places. 

Early on (around when you get to level 6-8) the enemy buffs will spawn. Having them warded might let you catch the enemy jungler/mid by surprise and steal their buff. If you have your first recall

* Disrupt other lanes/jungle camps. 

Basically, and being back in lane in time to not miss much CS is hard, but can be done. 

Playing champs with mobility is crucial to this end

1340758234.0,vnrlt,A tip to all the AD carries having to deal with the enemy Alistar support. ,Aberax,39,10,63,"TL;DR. Your AD carry starts boots/3pots to avoid early QW combos from alistar. On the very first back
 
Say that you're a Tristana/Taric lane, and then does his combo. Q's you up, and then W's you into his AD carry, who blows you right up well your support watches hopelessly. 

What are the problems here?

1) Alistar is an incredibly tanky support, but he can heal it right back. 

2) Alistar has control of the bushes

Two solutions, and then rush a brutalizer. 

What did this do? Before, both bushes, and target him down. Make him waste his mana, make him scared. A low health Alistar can't initiate without you picking up an easy kill. He'll try to heal himself, leaving him with no mana. A low mana alistar can't save his carry, and can't deal any damage. This may not completely counter the lane, but it will definitely slow down alistar's game plan. However

This is only my recommendation, and those people are right. The brutalizer does slow down your build, but it's a worthwhile investment, to set back the enemy ad and support. 

All I'm asking is try it

PS:Alistar is also countered by HARD cc supports. A slow isn't enough.

EDIT: Feel free to stick to your builds, everything is situational. I wouldn't buy a brutalizer just because I see an alistar in lane. Like I said: I buy brutalizer when alistar is being overly aggressive and feels that he can get within range of the AD carry's auto attacks without repercussion.

A note on why I mentioned armor pen, but any dedicated alistar puts armor in their rune page. I run armor marks, seals, and sometimes even quints.

In this game, knowing that I won't get every creep. When Vladimir harassed me in tower range, I stunned him on time so the tower could aggro on him. These are basic tricks for top, especially if you play Irelia/Warwick.

The secret to top lane is if your enemy freezes his lane, you put everyone +190 gold ahead.

**Tip #2: Mechanics:**

Abuse Jax's mechanics. His E+Q stun is the most broken thing ever. If you can land it in the right circumstances

**Tip #3: Communication and Team Fights**

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-R3n1KIj7uk

Go to 23:20. Basically Janna wards the bush and then, lowering his HP by a substantial amount. Then they proceed to steal the red, which they can do without much of a problem because it is 2v1 and the enemy jungler is chunked. If middle comes to help, their middle follows, same for top. Note how top is playing very aggressively and trying to chunk the enemy top as much as possible, which is usually not that hard because it is their ranged AD and most champions who go solotop cannot win trades against a ranged ad in the early levels (levels 1 and 2, possibly even later). After this they try to 3-man dive top for first blood.

Meanwhile, but so the enemy cannot counterjungle him. I believe that the main reason for leaving at least 1 monster is to prevent camp respawning instead of saving time. Why? Check out this:

The botlane - Gangplank in their case - jungles extremely low HP. However, and even then it is close.

The problem seems to be magnified when you have a jungler who cannot/will rarely gank at level 2 (rammus, ...,) and it doesn't seem to work if the enemy jungler can start at red.

--

That being said, making the assisting in the enemy jungle and the possible dive even easier. The answer for these kind of champions is usually 'gank them', but with full awareness of where their jungler is and by hurting him so badly, AP soraka and morde top seem to be extremely hard to deal with if you cannot rely on the jungle to punish them for overextending.

I have questions:

* I have been told that the first tic applys immediately when hit. So if you hit someone with 3 abilitys within half a second the initial 1% tic will have occurred 3 times (resetting the timer 2 times) is this right?

* On DOT abilities (singed acid, will every tick of the DOT restart the 3 second timer of liandrys and the 1.5 second timer of Rylais? 

So if malz aids lasts 3 seconds

* On AOE channel abilitys (karthus e, and restart the tics everytime they take another tic of damage from the area channel?
 
Further into this; are all Of these spells the same .5 second tic? If anivias ult and cassiopeias W are cast .2 seconds after each other, 2 at .2, 3 at .5 and 4 at .7?) because if they're losing 12% hp, I'd like to know. 

* Is Liandrys a unique effect or just a unique passive? If 2 enemy's have Sunfire you'll take 2 times the damage

None of these are super important but if anyone knows I'd love to find out. I checked the liandrys wiki entry but the notes about its mechanic aren't very indepth.

1370557362.0,1ftme7,A Beginner's Guide to Kits: Making the most of your champion,BlueNoseReindeer,34,4,4,"**If this looks like a humongous wall of text

After yesterday's [article] (http://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/1fr13f/get_what_you_paid_for_understanding_kits/)

A ""kit"" is a compilation of tools. The tools are **what the character's abilities can do.** Carries' kits are usually all about damage, supports want utility in the form of speed, CC, walls, etc. and bruisers generally want a little bit of everything.

So let's look at the kit of someone **simple** like [Vlad] (http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/Vladimir). *The next section is by no means exhaustive

* Passive: HP scaling off of AP, average-above average midgame, and strong late game). Also, he is manaless, which basically means he is better at long, drawn out engages and weaker in short, bursty ones

* Q: Single-target Damage and heal

* W: MS boost, heals for a bit, but this is almost negligible considering the health cost. AOE Damage scales off of health, so it's quite counter intuitive to use this ability for damage (if you were to build health to increase it's damage you would have to use your only defensive spell to go aggressive with...) except very situationally.

* E: AOE Damage

* R: Damage Amplification for 5 seconds and then ult damage hits, towers, minions, other allies, your own ignite, etc.).

* He is ranged, Nasus, Trundle), but his early game weakness and lack of dueling potential make him very weak to those with gapclosers (Irelia, Xin, Jax).

* His abilities are all pretty short range, he has healing and tankiness built in through his passive and q. Spellvamp is very good on him for this reason (as well as others).

* His damages aren't that great for bursting

* Because he needs to last in fights to maximize his potential, his W allows him to get off another set of abilities if used correctly.  A well-used Zhonya's is also allows for another set of cooldowns to be used.

* So, Zhonya's, etc) to do this. He is both limited and empowered by his kit because it lets him be an AP hypercarry, while also being an off-tank, but only if he gets his items. Without them, he is very weak.

* R is a great engage tool, he can do this. Because the damage is delayed, it is harder to use and less practical in a lot of situations than an ult with an immediate effect (Gragas, Katarina, Annie), in return, the damage amplification allows for more total damage. However, making the individual damage less (compare to Veigar

* His W will reset tower aggro so he can tower dive very well. It will also reset minion aggro. Depending on the mental state of the enemy team it may reset champion aggro as well. Because it makes him *untargetable* and not *invulnerable* he is very vulnerable to DoTs (e.g. ignite, etc.), especially since it takes health to use, but it is still very good (with perfect timing) against things such as Caitlyn and Darius ults.

* E is very useful for clearing clearing minion waves, and pool/Zhonya use will be key.

* Q is his only single-target ability, and is the only ability without a health cost (so you don't kill yourself laning. Because of the need to max this first his teamfight potential is largely delayed until L 13 when his E is maxed. Because it restores health as well as damages the enemy (and the fact he has no mana) he is very good at repeated trades. If Vlad can force trades with his opponent while still at early levels he can run them out of mana very quickly (the cooldown is very long at low levels, so he has to be trading as soon as the cd comes up, and using his autos along with his Qs).

* Because many of the tools in his kit (W, once he has any form of spellvamp he is good at fighting in  enemy minion waves because he can sustain back health (although he has to be careful of their damage if he uses autoattacks).

* Because he is reliant on getting close for a long time to get off multiple cooldowns he is quite susceptible to CC. There is also danger of getting tunnel vision that leads to being kited along viciously.

* Because his ult works well as an execute

* Because of the sustained damage that he can give, he doesn't need to stop and auto attack, so its fairly easy to keep getting E+Q combos off (although they do stop his running), assuming you have a long distance over which you can run.

* Flash is very handy for escaping as well as jumping in to get off a combo to get a kill whether or not you are carrying ignite.

I think I could go on for a bit longer (and someone who is actually good at Vlad could go on for a long time), how fast they can clear each jungle camp at each stage of the game, how well they benefit from bush play, what items/summoners work well, etc. Every context that you can think of, think of how that champion's abilities could be used in it, and rate them as good, great,** particularly at lower levels of play. 

Once you play this game for awhile, and rock teamfights... what's their name again?"" A champion's kit does not define the teamcomp, just as a single tool in a champion's kit does not define the entire kit, but it does contribute to it. Maximizing a kit is dependent on a lot of variables, particularly the kits of your team, the enemy team, and the state of that game.

1361230733.0,18s6dh,Spell vamp: A useless stat? (WALL OF TEXT),GVx,37,8,61,"I want to discuss the viability of spell vamp on AP mids

I think it can be agreed that spell vamp is a defensive stat and currently the king of defensive stats is - HEALTH. Everybody and their mothers is health stacking

*WARNING MATH INCOMING:*

By buying spirit of the spectral wraith

Spirit of the Spectral wraith is 2k gold. The revolver is 1.2k gold and the combine is 100

Putting a cost on the runes is a bit of an estimate, and you're getting 6% from runes, the **the rune value is 600 gold**

Quantifying the cost of putting points into spell vamp in the utility tree is hard, but fairly small variable, as the spell vamp provided is **only 3%**

So essentially, and then some. Those two items alone, **priced at 1,475 gold** gives you **560 health.** 

SO how much health do we have to ""vamp"" in one teamfight to make it worth the price we've paid? 

Using the formulas from here - http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/Spell_vamp

We can see that:
When only casting single target spells - You must do around 700 damage AFTER resistances to justify the cost of the spell vamp items over health.

When only casting AOE/multi-target spells - You must do around 2800 damage AFTER resistances to justify the cost. 

So knowing this is it viable? I was running spirit on cass and ahri

Do note that you are getting 40 ap for making your spectral wraith so that adds about 400 gold to cost efficiency. Even then you have to be putting out a LOT of damage to make worth buying just a giants belt.

TL;DR You have to put out around 700 single target damage

1365963387.0,1cc4tk,AP Jax: A quick primer,Kraz226,40,14,33,"I'll be blunt. Tried AP Jax out and I'm now building him that way in my standard ranked play. It feels much better overall than the old Trinity/Botrk/Gunblade

Build goes something like this...

**Masteries: 15-15-0

15-15-0 is for tough lanes with really hard harass where you need the added tankiness that Unyielding and Block add. I'm usually fine with the 21-9-0 page (taking the usual AP half of the page) because it lets you bully people early on with your W.

**Runes: Flat AP Quints, MR/lvl Blues**

This is the same page I use on Teemo, and scaling late game with the penetration runes. Hybrid pen is great on Jax, and the AP quints make your early game more bearable since your W will be doing a nice chunk of damage as long as you have the mana to use it. You can replace the blues with flat AP (or AP/lvl) if you're not going against any strong AP damage, but I think the MR/lvl is better. 

**Summoner Spells: Ghost/Ignite, and Teleport/Ghost**

I run Ghost/Ignite most games. Jax's Q is so fantastic that you're not in dire need of Flash. Therefore

**Skill Order: R &gt; W &gt; Q &gt; E**

Standard fare here

**Items:** *Lich Bane*, Rod of Ages, Morellonomicon, Rylais, GA, Nashor's Tooth, Wit's End, Randuins

(Core items highlighted)

These items are what I try to aim for in most games. There are obviously many ways you can change the builds around

Lich Bane is obvious

Besides that you have lots of choices to make. Enemy has lots of mages/magic damage? Abyssal or Wit's End work great. 

Enemy has big burst of initation or a bif AD presence? Zhonya's is your item. 

Jax can build just about any AP item in the game

After trying out a bunch of items, but not gold efficient anymore, and Wit's End is strong but not as amazing since Abyssal is a better item overall for dealing and reducing magic damage since it's aoe rather than single target. 

The nice thing about Jax is that he doesn't really need any attack speed since his passive is so great

**Early Game**

Early on you want a sustain item and a Sheen rush. I buy Flask in most games since it's still quite strong (especially on a character like Jax who is going to be burning mana frequently). Hextech Revolver is nice, and build it immediately into a RoA. This might sound odd, but getting this early on makes you incredibly tanky once it's stacked and lets you hammer away in lane with W without the fear of running out of mana. It also scales quite well since it's such a gold efficient item. However, don't bother getting it unless it will be your first or second major buy. 

If you're going up against a tough AD based opponent

**Mid-Late Game**

By now you want to at least have 1-2 full items done. Lich Bane is usually the first

1365035938.0,1bmlrd,Buying vision wards more frequently,tsarnicky,28,0,27,"**tl;dr:** I suggest pink wards should be bought more frequently (off the top of my head

**Why I'd buy a pink:**

Pinks cost only 50g more than regular wards

Whether or not your pink gets you a kill the vision ward denies enemy vision and so let's your team roam more easily

**When I'd buy a pink:**

As my calculation above suggests it helps to know where your opponent warded.

My calculation also took into account assist money

If you know an ally is snowballing and will want to roam

Ward control is less important if your teammates have globals or can 'jump' over wards.  ex: I wouldn't buy pinks as frequently with nocturne or hecarim jungle.

1364230087.0,1azcf9,I'm a Silver II player that picks a lot of unconventional roles for champions.  I'm curious on what other people think of the viability of these picks at higher Elos.,TimPowerGamer,33,6,56,"So

Leona/Lux bot lane (Power of Light) - They both proc their passive when Lux is doing damage, Lux could be made into an ADC (4 seconds of lockdown with bonus damage and ANYONE with a full AD build can kill you), but that's pushing on Crittlesticks' boundries of Fear, Thwap, Thwap, Thwap.  Hilarious, but probably not as effective as it could be.

Maoraka - AP Carry Maokai with support Soraka.  Maokai has a lot of natural sustain with his passive, all you have to do is get a target to about 400 health and you can execute them.  If they decide to engage on you, who are they going to attack?  Soraka gives you 16 MR, an Armor increasing heal, all of those abilities give you the ability to heal yourself by auto-attacking, and Maokai wants people to fight him because he deals most of his damage by being right on top of you.  Certain comps counter this, though.  Volibear can eat sapling all day if he has some MR runes/masteries on

Support (Glass Cannon AP Hypercarry Assassin) Poppy - I'm really good with Poppy and I love playing her, so I've been playing her in a way that completely ignores her farming weaknesses and her inability to handle a lot of strong top laners.  Poppy does a great job of abusing brush control and when combined with Vayne, can cause anyone out of position to get destroyed.  Very weak to poke comps unless you can get someone to go balls deep with you or have a lot of coordination with your jungler.

Support Anivia - This is a Vayne/Cait support primarily (Caitlyn for zone control by cutting off their path around the wall with her traps, if they can't jump over your wall, you put the wall up, Vayne condemns them, then you time your stun on top of them so they're stuck for the free Vayne kill.

Bruiser Varus - This is the one I have the most hope for.  While there's pretty much no reason to play Bruiser Varus top lane since Jayce does most of what Varus does, I can pick whatever resistance item I need against my opponent.  If they have an Elise, Akali, Rumble, you can start with a null-magic and rush your Merc Treads.  If they have an AD champion, you can start Cloth and rush Razors (I pick up Razors to contribute to neutral monster clears like baron/Dragon or for farming minions/small camps if I happen to be doing that.  Mostly, it's a cheap item with armor that can be sold later that can help push lanes).  You can decide between Ninja Tabi and Merc Treads based on their team composition.  Your first major rush items are (based on what you're playing against) Phage -&gt; Mallet, Null Magic (for Wit's End), people might be wondering where the damage is on this build and what skills I max.  I always max W first to compensate for my lower damage basic attacks (and to make my damage hybrid so they can't build resistance against one aspect of my build to shut me down, finished product.

1362004907.0,19curw,Spirit of the Elder Lizard on MF,Paradigm6790,32,5,32,"Hi all

I have a friend who plays a lot of jungle and he has been raving about this item

**Here are the item's stats:**
+50 attack damage
+14 health regen
+7 mana regen
+10% cooldown reduction
Passive	
Unique Passive - Butcher: Damage dealt to neutral monsters increased by 25%.
Unique Passive - Incinerate: Basic attacks and spells that do not inflict damage-over time deal 15-66 (based on level) bonus true damage over 3 seconds on hit.

**Builds out of:**
Spirit Stone (700g)
    Hunter's Machete (300g)
    Faerie Charm (180g)
    Rejuvenation Bead (180g)
    40g
Pickaxe (875g)
725g

**Cost Analysis(As taken from LoLWiki):**
50 attack damage = 2000g
14 health regeneration = 504g
7 mana regeneration = 420g
10% cooldown reduction = 322g
*Total Gold Value = 3246g*

I wont go into calculating *what* you get for free, some CDR and the passives are free as well.

Now

So, 10% CDR and the Incinerate passive. 50 AD is *worth * 2000g, but since bag space is not an issue, treat it as 1500g for the BF sword you could have instead, which brings our item down to 800g for 10% CDR the Incinerate passive.

CDR is awesome on MF, which brings us to roughly 480g for Incinerate.

At it's worst, it's worth more than AD.

**Incinerate and MF:**
First off, but since its at the same time as the autoattack proc it's irrelevant).

Secondly

This means that a full MF ult (assuming level 18) will do 5 ticks of 65/3 true damage (1 proc a second during the 2 second channel,** which is equivalent to 38.7 AD, if AD were true damage.

If your target has 100 armor (after reductions)
If your target has 150 armor (after reductions)

Your Q also procs the 65 (assume lvl 18 again) true damage. That is equiv to 81.5 AD after reductions on the first hit


**TL;DR Lizard Elder on MF is good**

First off the Morellonomicon

* 75 Ability Power
* 12 Mana Regeneration

* UNIQUE Passive: Dealing magic damage to an enemy champion below 40% health inflicts Grievous Wounds on them for 4 seconds. (Grievous wounds reduces healing and regeneration rates by 50%)

My normal build is now: Athenes &gt; Rabadons &gt; Morellonomicon &gt; Void Staff &gt; Zhonyas ofcourse with sorc boots. 

With the Morellonomicon and the Athene's Unholy Grail (standard on lux) you will have 40% CDR. This means you have a standard 24 sec cooldown on your ult

But now that i have seen the effect of the Liandry's Torment, since it gives me that extra bit of protection.

1371104746.0,1g94js,My experimental Nunu jungle strategy.,flyingbird0026,33,6,51,"I've recently been casually experimenting with a hilarious strategy where you utilise Nunu's stupidly safe jungle clear and guaranteed late-game supporting capabilities to create an unstoppable snowballing effect in a lane.   

The strategy is really simple and as far as I can tell pretty safe (assuming it is applied to a strong laner)

What this does is give the laner a ridiculous level advantage and early game power boost to completely zone out and snowball their lane. For example, this will give them an instant jump to level 2 when they get to lane along with a red buff and the Nunu will still have no problems clearing jungle. Also, get ready for some counter ganks on that lane because the enemy jungler will get greedy for the buffs.   
   
I've only tried it a few times, he then proceeded to stomp the lane and roam, performing ganks far stronger than any I could have done as a double buff Nunu. The other more notable example was with a friend playing Draven (he insisted I posted this after the hilarity of it), he went to lane with red buff and level 2 meaning the enemy laner had absolutely no chance to farm or even collect xp and I just went on to farm my jungle and apply some map pressure, in the end I was slightly underleveled for giving all my buffs away but I had a legendary Draven (and Zyra support by the end) and blood-boil to make him even more godly.   

**tl;dr: Play Nunu jungle with some friends (who should pick strong early laning/snowballing champs) and try giving away every single one of your buffs to them along with ALL the xp from the camp

I have a request for people’s opinions on these builds, but not the game to play. That leaves me with time to think and plot MUHAHHAHA. 

 *cough* Anyway

First Up: AP-Shred Kog’Maw

This build focuses around Kog’Maw’s Bio-Arcane Barrage and its %-Health Shred. 

Full Build : 

[Sorcerer’s Shoes](http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/Sorcerer%27s_Shoes) +
[Malady](http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/Malady) +

[Rabadon’s Deathcap](http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/Rabadon%27s_Deathcap) +
[Zhonya’s Hourglass](http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/Zhonya%27s_Hourglass). 

Stats:

* + 115% Attack Speed
*   +435.5 Ability Power (Deathcap % Added in)
* +43 Flat Magic Penetration (Total Malady Stacks + Sorcerer’s Shoes)
* +35% Magic Penetration
* +50 Armor  

What does this entail for when Kog’Maw starts unleashing?

* Bio-Arcane Barrage when maxed does 6% (+1% Per 100 AP) Health damage per. That means with no runes or masteries

* Malady will do 15 (+10% Bonus AP). Again with no runes or masteries

* And his base damage 46 (+3 per level) will be at 100 at level 18. Which becomes nothing really at the end of the game when everyone has some kind of armor boost.

So per attack you get Base (100 – Armor) + Bio-Arcane (10% Base Health – Magic Resist) + Malady (58 –Magic Resist) onto 3 Targets who will have reduced Magic Resist due to Malady.

TL;DR: 
AP Kog’maw with Hurricane and Malady to be an AP shred

So as the game goes on, while the mana users have large enough mana pools to get through a fight without issue. Most energy users don't build CDR either, so the 20% CDR would be beast on them.

Obviously this would depend highly on team comp. I don't think it'd ever be better to pass blue to Zed when you have Anivia on your team.

1339972127.0,v71yc,Vision Wards and Oracle's Elixir - Which and When,jtiza,29,3,12,"Original post on [TizaPlaysLoL](http://tizaplayslol.wordpress.com/2012/06/17/vision-wards-vs-oracles-which-and-when/)

Vision wards and Oracle's Elixir are the two purchasable means of stealth detection on Summoner's Rift (and Twisted Treeline).  Stealth is employed both by wards and champions with stealth abilities

**Vision Ward** - 125g

*Places an invisible ward that reveals the surrounding area and stealthed units in the area for 3 minutes.*

**Oracle's Elixir** - 400g

*Grants stealth detection until your champion dies.*

**Vision Wards vs. Oracle's**

Pink wards are best suited for **area superiority**.  Controlling high-value static positions are best done with a pink ward that will do nothing but watch that spot for you.  This will be near Dragon or Baron, while wall combos like Alistar/Vayne need vision to keep the hurt coming.

It is important to note that **you are not ""safe"" from stealth ganks just because a pink ward is in the lane**.  Putting a pink ward right next to you will only give you warning when the ganker is right on top of you

Oracle's is best for **large-scale map control**.  It counters widespread or perpetual ward placement or stealth champs post-laning phase.  It allows for roamers to clear wards as they find them, although a particularly tricky stealth opponent may merit a second when the team is split up.

**Who Should Buy Oracle's?**

The value of having Oracle's comes down to **map coverage**, Oracle's usually comes down to either the support or the jungler for these reasons.  Having an Oracle's is not helpful if you never leave your lane, if you run the risk of getting hard focused in teamfights and die, or if you really need your items to help you do your real job.  Champions like Janna, with her high mobility and escape mechanisms, or Nautilus, with his high defensive stats and shield, like an Irelia

**Vision Ward Usage**

* Dragon early-mid game and baron mid-late game to get vision of the creeps AND enemy wards nearby. Shutting down their vision of drag/baron is HUGE.
* Stealth opponents in lane. An early pink shuts down champs like Akali or Twitch if they rely on their Stealth to trade.
* Stealth roamers.  A jungling Shaco or Twitch, since you ARE warding your lane, right?).  Seeing them coming is  more important than seeing them once they're on you, since you'll be able to use the warning to decide to either catch them early, drop an extra pink to pick a fight when they show up, or just run back to hug your big, safe
* Counter-warding enemy support. See them ward river/brush

1311868035.0,j29gt,Alternate lane strategy (2/2/1),zebano,35,9,16,"So everyone knows the common setup is 2/1/1+jungle. but since I like theory so much I wanted to consider a different setup (I'm also interested in making double jungles work). 

2/2/1 with the 1 near your blue (top for blue

Basic idea: 

- the solo  + 2 mid start at blue. One of the mids will tank it and it will be given to an AP carry

- One mid should probably have smite.

- Your solo lane gets normal solo experience.

- Mid is responsible for having one person break off and kill 
wolves/wraiths/blue when available (may not be the one to keep blue).

-  Your dual lane near red is responsible for dual golems at 1:40 and red when available. 

- One mid is responsible for helping the AP carry top/mid get quick blue buffs when available (if it's not the carry themselves taking it). 


Advantages:

- 2 mid allows for easy roaming/counterjunging/ganking

- Early blue for AP caster allows better lane presence than when a jungler has blue.

- 2 mid may be able to zone out the enemies best early game champ.

- Mid lane can still contain someone like TF who can teleport for much of the map



Disadvantages:

- Having only 3 at blue makes you susceptible to gank

- Someone has to take smite and if they aren't using it constantly they're missing out on 5 gold often.

- Slower to take red buff.

- No one person in charge of timing all the buffs. 

- Potentially harder to notice when enemy is in your jungle

- people will argue about who is responsible for buying wards

- it's unconventional and some people don't like that.

- killing jungle creeps requires a certain amount of sustain which many champs don't have. Splitting the responsibilities may just make it so more champs have to be regularly.

- it's similar to low level games  (2/1/2) with multiple people taking jungle when they can and no-one wants to be a noob.

- The solo must be able to 1v2 if on purple

- less dragon control if purple.

In terms of skill max order I'm guessing R&gt;E&gt;Q&gt;W.  Maxing Q looks like it will burn far too much mana to be viable unless you start flask&gt;tear&gt;manamune.

As for builds the options are: **bruiser** (IBGT, new mr items etc), **ranged adc build** (BT, BOTRK or IE, Shiv, LW etc), **stactives** (youmuu's, hydra

Against traditional AP mids getting a couple actives let's you put out surprising amounts of burst

A few random observation: his ulti synergizes beautifully with shiv and his Q now counts as movement for shiv (According to wiki)

As for the question of assassin-reset style vs dps?  From a theorycrafting stand point dps looks much stronger.  Let's imagine the ideal reset style yi fight: a mid game dragon fight

[link](http://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/1idptp/master_yis_pbe_state_impressions_after_27_games/) to a relevant analysis of the new PBE AD yi on /r/lol 

**UPDATE: COMPARISON OF MOST YI STARTING ITEMS BELOW** I've calculated master yi's dps at level 12 over 5 seconds with different starts, but seeing as I made that same mistake on each dps calculation my math should give us a relevant comparison.

DPS COMPARISON: 1. BOTRK at 390 dps 2. BT at 341 3 dps. Youmuu's at 333 dps (this falls off after 6 seconds though) 4. Triforce at 327 dps 5. Shiv at 320 dps

OTHER FACTORS:  Starting youmuu's is out of the questions because it's dps is only comparable while the actives is up (although it does grant 70 more MS than the other starts while active

CONCLUSION: BoTRK and Triforce are the two starts I'd suggest considering when playing ad yi.  To decide between them I'd consider such factors as: Do I want crit chance? Do I need health or lifesteal?  Are they stacking HP?  Do I need bonus mana for Q?  Am I focusing on Q+resets (in which case go triforce)? How valuable will the BoTRK speed/slow active be?

**Thresh Skarner Combo**

This combo would basically be Skarner rushing in and grabbing *anyone*. Thresh would throw his lantern from a distance behind and Skarner would grab it while the suppressed target follows. This allows for the team to be able to nuke down whoever got grabbed before anyone can react

This combo can be further enhanced by having an Anivia on the same team to wall off the enemy so that they have 0 counterplay. If the target somehow survives the nuke 

This would make Skarner be viable in competitive play again as it doesn't matter who he grabs as he has no specific target in mind. The team would then be able to 4v5 push. 

**Shyvana Build** 

Hecarim has been a popular pick recently due to his insane aoe damage combined with Spirit of the Lizard Elder. But why hasn't anyone thought of that item on Shyvana? Burnout + Lizard Elder should be able to deal a crazy amount of magic + true damage. 

This gets even better in Shyvana's dragon form as her Q is aoe , Xinzhao , Renekton ) and her ult itself is able to spread the true damage across the entire enemy team while cc-ing them at the same time. 

This could be her only damage item and she could build tanky after getting Lizard Elder just like Hecarim and deal tons of damage while being extremely tanky at the same time due to her ult. If more damage is needed a Blade of the Ruined King can be thrown in to help with sticking and dealing massive damage as well.

1345195608.0,ydbgo,[Meta] Dominion,SenSidethink,35,10,46,"### Dominion - How to and why.
## Introduction
I pretty much write this because i'm tired of people joining my dominion games with stuff like ""Omg a talon on dominion"", its just 5vs5 pvp"" and then end up feeding with double the amount of deaths then kills (if not even more) and the words ""*I own at classic, you know?*"".

## The Roles
Dominion got a meta just like SR but it's new and people still have to learn how to play on it i guess. The first thing would be that just like on SR there are different roles char's can fit in. Note that one char can easily fit more then one role.

- Pusher / Stopper

&gt; The pusher goes top at the start of a round and makes the 3-4 enemys that rush the windmil drop the tower by hitting them once when they try to cap. Char's that can do this greatly are chars that have access to aoe spells with a bit range on them or skills that hit multiply targets. You basically make them unable to cap without atacking/killing your team.

- Defender

&gt; The defender goes bot at the start and it's role is to defend the bot tower (that gets a buff from time to time) while not pushing too hard. If you outpush the botlane you will neutralize the enemy tower and stop the creeps from spawning = you loose money. Only outpush the lane if you know that you can definitly cap the enemy tower, zyra, yorick and other people with a strong laning phase.

- Taker / Backdoor

&gt; This role works well mid/lategame but only rarely on early. It's mostly filled by a character with extremly high movement ability or skills that reposition them like TF, Eve (because of her stealth) and other. You can either try to pick their mid tower after they went to the windmil if you have 1-2 tanky guys going top, this will make you drop their mid by over 30-40% and they will be forced to go back to the mid tower with atleast one person to stop you from capping leaving top to your team. This doesnt work if the enemy team got a tacker too, most of the time. Mid/lategame you will always try to get behind them when they go for your windmil and steal their mid during smaller fights between your teams. Nothing is more fun then a enemy trying to escape in a tower that isnt even his own one anymore.


&gt; ""A four man backdoor on the enemy mid when you can't take the Windmill is far more reliable - send a single champion on the point while the rest of the team waits in the jungle. At best, and then you take the Windmill back from the last 2 defenders. At worst, it's a straight 4 vs 4 fight in the jungle instead of a 4 vs 4 + turret."" [(added via ZeMar)] (http://www.reddit.com/user/ZeMar)

- Supporter

&gt; People will say this ones are useless, but you can do other fancy stuff here too. Supporter like Soraka can also work as a defender going offtanky with some ap on the botlane. You can harass with your E, keep the lane with your Q, heal yourself or a ally when ganking with W and also support teamfights (up to 4 supports per ulti) with your ulti at the windmil while you keep bot save. Also you farm extremly well on the bot lane (lasthitting most minions will get you atleast 70-80% of the money a ""good"" enemy with some kills already got).

- ~~People who feed~~

&gt; You.. know them. That fancy full AP runepage lee without any armor

## Stuff you should NOT do or think
1. Never drop the defense of a tower to get a buff if enemys are alive.
2. If you have to defend a tower because enemys are comming always wait at the tower. In early/mid game it does heavy dmg and doesnt stop atacking when you always hit your enemys to stop capping. Never think a bush is better then your lovely tower.
3. If you kill the enemy on the bot lane
4. Use your exact build from SR because you think it works well. Dominion is faster
5. Points = Skill. Not at all. You can ks all the time or run around capping towers and be useless and be ontop of the list yet you suck. The only thing that counts is that you dont feed and the points you see on the top end of the screen
6. Get the buff in the mid when playing shaco/twitch/eve and any other champs. The passive hitting enemys around you will remove the ""omg where is he"" effect and make you a firework.

## Stuff you should do
1. Leave the buff in the mid to the carry. A tank wont need the shield/extra dmg and probally just steal kills with the passive from carry's who need them to keep outdamage the enemy team. A carry gets all he needs from it, you love it. Only get this in rare situations else.
2. Abuse the healspots on your lanes. You can either drop shrooms or traps on them or keep the enemy from using it while you always heal yourself back after harrasing. (Note: It heals hp AND sp)
3. Use your minions. If they defend top 2vs2 for example push minions into their tower to neutralize it. This leaves you in a 2vs2 not a 2vs2+tower.
4. Abuse the laser. Chars like skarner
5. Use a speedbuff whenever you run through the jungle. It can make you chase faster and escape the same way.

## Differences between SR and Domi (Playstyle ones)
1. You get passive gold
2. GP10 items. Please just dont ever take them. The gold you get in the 15-20min a round lasts isnt worth it at all. (GP10 and RoA work at the same speed they do on SR)
3. No jungle.
4. Some items are different and some new items are there. Entropie for example.
5. Dominion gives 56 gold per 10 seconds while SR gives 13 gold per 10 seconds.

## Summoner Spells

- Flash: ★★☆
- Exhaust: ★★★
- Ghost: ★★☆
- Heal: ★★☆
- Clarity: ★☆☆
- Ignite: ★★☆
- Garisson: ★★☆
- Promote: ★★☆
- Cleanse: ★★☆
- Surge: ★☆☆
- Revive: ★★★

&gt; Everybody always wants to ask me why Revive is so important in high Elo. For a bot laner
For a top laner

- Very strong in the windmill fight.
- Stronger than Ghost.
- Allows you to distract enemies in a lost team fight by running away from your team.
- Allows you to recover from a bad mistake such as getting bushwhacked.
- No other summoner spell is going to let you get out of ganks anyways
- Allows you to maintain a winning game in the face of adjusted respawn timers (in favor of the enemy team).

Overall

### The End
I just hope people read this and stop going with 5 people for one tower the complete game leaving bot lane alone or feeding. Dominion is a valid game mode just like SR and people enjoy it. Stuff like ""I only play SR; proper LoL you know?"" just makes you sound like you suck at dominion. If you do mistakes at the first rounds on dominion nobody is going to blame you

1344264812.0,xrmxn,Counter to the Graves/Taric armor nightmare.,Yondee,29,4,54,"When I AD bot

So I propose a *theorized* counter. I haven't had much free time

The premise of this counter is throwing Veigar bot lane, it is just common meta to put them bottom with the increased sustain for farm. Ez and Sivir excel at this, while the unconventional Kayle ADC works extremely well too.

The thought process behind the swap:  
Veigar is an AP that thrives off single target last hits. He needs it to boost his AP and become the scary little guy everyone has seen at one point or another. Although Veigar can do fine mid last hitting (in terms of mana regen) you usually have to trade off between aiming for CS or harass. Having a Soraka would give you enough mana to do both  effectively. Thus
The real reason I am mentioning it is because it negates the strongest part of this common bottom lane. Veigar will be doing magic damage to harass, If Soraka can get a Starfall or two off you are probably doing near true damage as Veigar, which is a scary thing indeed.

I will list the pros and cons that I can think of.

Pros:  

* Safely farming Veigar.  
* Good engage/disengage for trades.  
* Stat advantage for trades.  
* Negate the strengths of your lane opponents.

Cons:  

* Very situational.  
* Non roaming middle lane.  
* Less safe ADC farm (Debatable ^1)  

 ^1 : I think many ADCs are perfectly viable in mid

I would love to hear your opinions on this subject. I plan on trying it out at some point in the future. The main problem being it is so situational it could be a long time before I can seize my opportunity. Thank you for reading

I'm the top lane player in my team, I'm currently looking for some currently unorthodox, but totally viable picks.

Karma

I bought Karma in the last week, as she can duel well vs. almost anyone, but I feel like her damage is lacks in the early-midgame, and she's way too vulnerable for ganks and high mobility ( riven top + jungle ali wtfff ).
However, atleast early on. ( think about jax, gp for example )
Lategame, Nautilus or Blitz, and she has the potential to carry and to support in the same time.

Bruiser Fizz

Super strong early game, and acts like a super anti carry in lategame, because he can still dish out tons of damage even without his burst combo. Strong laning, strong lategame, can be build multiple ways - I recently picked him up and I feel like he's more viable as bruiser than most people thinks. ( Well, in soloQ he's better as an assasin, because of his potential to snowball hard )

AD Carry Kayle

I see more Kayles on top after Rincent's guide on SoloMid. She's really a very strong pick, very vulnerable to ganks ( that little movement speed boost won't gonna help you ), and she ends up pushing her lane most of the time.

AP Soraka

Graves

Now he's the one I curious about. I love playing AD Carries, a nice gapcloser and the smokescreen. He can splitpush very well, and end up having a very, very strong lategame, as he can build himself like as an AD carry ( Okay, maybe add a Wriggles or a Mercury early on ).
This is just theorycrafting

Sejuani

I don't own her, a Rylai ( yo boar i herd you like slows so i put a slow in your slow so you can slow while you slow ), a RoA maybe, a FoN, FH, and you have a nice initator and tank, who can still deal alot of damage.

1376687717.0,1kigqs,Graves - Blade of the Ruined King vs Bloodthirster - Maths included,Sicariidae,35,7,18,"For a long time

However, Tristana and Twitch to add to their burst early-game.

Blade of the Ruined King seems like a good item for Graves; the extra attack speed allows him to refresh the cooldown of Quickdraw faster, late-game where he tends to fall-off slightly isn't such a problem with the passive of Blade.

So

Assuming that Graves and his target (I chose Kog'Maw) are both level 9, Lifesteal Quints) and standard masteries (I chose 21-9-0). Assuming Doran's Blade start on both champions, rushing either Bloodthirster or Blade depending on the test. Assuming Buckshot hits point-blank for maximum damage. All damage is post-resistance/penetration calculations.

**Stacked Bloodthirster**

* Buckshot Damage: 336.89
* Ultimate Damage: 412.39
* Total Damage: 749.28

**Blade of the Ruined King**

* Buckshot Damage: 269.99
* Ultimate Damage: 343.52
* Blade Active Damage: 133.80
* Total Damage: 747.31

As you can see, the overall damage difference is only 0.26%.

Two things to note: this assumed the Bloodthirster was fully-stacked.   It seems slightly unrealistic that a Graves was able to fully-stack a Bloodthirster by level 9, the difference was minimal. Secondly, this is only single-target burst; Blade of the Ruined King will impact Graves' AoE contribution to teamfights, however, with the self-peel of the active, passive damage and additional attack speed, he contributes more auto-attack damage than normal.

I had planned to add more regarding the damage auto-attacks do early-game, let me know and I'll start working on rebuilding the spreadsheet.

&gt;**Spiderlings**
&gt;
* Health reduced to 90-260 from 125-550 Armor increased to 30/50/70/90 from 30 (based on Spider Form rank) Magic Resist increased to 50/70/90/110 from 50 (based on Spider Form rank) 
* Multi-target damage reduction adjusted to 25% from 10/20/30/40% 
* Spiderlings no longer continue taking actions before vanishing once Elise shifts into Human Form 
* Spiderlings now group closer together while moving

&gt;**Volatile Spiderling**
&gt;
* Movement Speed has been reduced
&gt;
&gt;**Rappel**
&gt;
* Elise can no longer descend outside of the indicated area Fixed a bug where Elise could begin casting spells and attacking as soon as she began her descent while she was still untargetable 
* Spiderlings will now descend from Rappel slightly after Elise instead of descending at the same time

The Rappel range fix I suppose is fair. The spiderlings reppeling slower is a little bit of an annoyance, not really game breaking.

I am not sure about the logic behind reducing the Volatile Spiderling? I never thought ‘OMG that thing is too fast’

Now the spiderlings have:

* Effective physical health 110-383 from 153-676
* Effective magic health 120-396 from 166-733
(Before the multi-target reduction)

Including the changes to the multi-target, from 11+ they will considerably squisher. Especially when you consider most champions will have some form of armour/magic pen, so their effective health will be reduced further.

864 health = 360 [bead] + 504 [philo]

648 mana

180 gold

It takes approximately 13 (6 health + 7 mana) potions to give these stats

The burst from philostone also is heavier the second back

[I was looking at the AA range of champions](http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/Range) for crafting an unconventional (non-meta) *ADC* playstyle &amp; I came across one champion in particular that had an unusually long AA range compared to others in her class: **Annie**. *Hear me out...*

&gt;[Annie's toolkit](http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/Annie)


Here are some possible benefits to give Annie an edge in a duo bot lane:

* Annie has **625** AA range. That's the **second highest** normal range in the game

* Annie's passive coupled with a 4 second CD on her Q means she can stun often &amp; potentially win trades this way

* Annie's Q makes her **incredibly** mana efficient

* Her E would be leveled up with priority

**Cons**

* None of her abilities scale with AD

* Squishy without her E being up

* No escape without her stun up



Essentially

* Wit's End / Malady
* Trinity Force
* Iceborn Gauntlet
* Bloodthirster
* T2 boots of your choice 
* **Warmog's Armor** or **Zhonya's** since she does scale with AP. You just don't want to get caught out and die quickly

Build I've tried and really liked is Sorcerer's Shoes, Iceborn Gauntlet, Banshee's Veil and Mikael's Crucible

Ofc build order depends on needs, because if you have a Tear and Archangel's/Manamune and hit max, they will upgrade, but the tear stacks reset. Not sure if this happens if you have both upgraded tears. It would make sense if they both upgrade to Muramana and Seraph's at the same time.

Mid: Kennen, Karthus, Anivia. 

Top: Jax, Poppy, AD Sion, Nasus, Shen, Singed, Kayle. 

Jungle: Dr.Mundo, Amumu, Malphite, Nocturne, Hecarim. 

AD Carry: Tristana, Ashe, Vayne. 

Support: Janna

**Explantions**


Mid: AoE clearing power, and ultimates were the main factors. Most OP champs in the game I think are Morgana, Karthus, and Kennen due to their ability to deal very large portions of damage to an entire enemy team while not dying (or dying on purpose in Karth's case). Veigar is great for his late nuking ability, but a good assassin will ruin his day much easier than a Kennen or Morgana. Also Anivia. A good wall can win a team fight easily, just look at Froggen for examples. 

Top: Damage, and pushing power are the main factors here. Best champs IMO are actually Singed, Malphite and Poppy. All three can single handedly win a game during the transition from mid to late during team fights. Once Singed gets strong enough, he can push lanes with impunity and then run to initiate with his team very quickly while being extremely tanky and slowing/damaging the enemy team in fights. Poppy simply has an extremely good couple passives and a game breaking ult that let her 1v4 in some situations and still come out on top with a couple of kills. Only problem I've found with Poppy is her mana-hungry nature. Malphite just holds back enemy AD champs very hard. He debuffs attack speed so well while being so tanky that he can control a team fight exceptionally. Not to mention his initiation power with his ultimate. 

Jungle: Similar to top for stats I looked at. Nautilus is crazy good here with his awesome kit of CC techniques that also let him tank efficiently and deal AoE damage at the same time. Amumu is also good for the same reasons. 

AD Carry: Tristana my favorite here, but doesn't have a very good steroid or a reliable escape. Corki has good damage, and can kite people well, but lacks the range and steroids of Tristana or Kog. ~~I was going to put Vayne here, but to be honest I think if she ever gets hit with some sort of hard CC she is instantly nuked down due to how squishy and short ranged she is.~~  Vayne has way too much damage for me to ignore with all her great steroids. Also, tumble crits. She is better than Corki as far as I am now concerned (after a closer look at her damage). 

Support: Janna is queen of the supports, he can be awful the entire game, then land one good pull over a wall or at a Baron fight and the game will instantly be won. Soraka has a boring kit and mediocre peel, but her heals (despite being nerfed) have a global presence and can turn a team fight completely around for her team when used right. 

Anyway there are my thoughts. Sorry for my last post being so shallow

1340955042.0,vsbes,wit's end v wriggle's; sunfire cape v randuin's: lolking statistics,tsarnicky,31,6,46,"**CONCLUSIONS ARE MY OPINION AND SUBJECTIVE ANALYSIS OF WHAT I THINK IS A LIKELY EXPLANATION FOR DIFFERENCES IN WINRATE

**PLEASE READ MY RESPONSES TO OTHERS COMMENTS BEFORE COMMENTING ON MY ANALYSIS

**INTRO**

The recent update to the lolking.net site rekindled my interest in using it's item win-rate charts to objectively compare the success rates of items.

However I came across a few issues in comparing items using lolking.net's item pages' win statistics:

* differences in price
* differences in which build order slot/role the item fills (ie: BT generally comes after IE)
* differences in role of champion (ie: a well used IE probably has a greater influence than a well used sunfire cape)

however


**EXPLANATION OF WHAT I DID**

The most enlightening/unexpected comparisons I found were those between sunfire cape &amp; randuin's omen (both hp/armor: good vs strong ad carry


Both pair of items shared a few of the same champions on their top champions page: I then compared these top champions win rates (with this item) and % of games in which item was bought.

I assumed that a lower % of games bought most likely signified the item was bought later into the game / with more money

(edit in response to 1st comment): I think the wit's end


**CONCLUSION**

[*wriggles*](http://www.lolking.net/items/3154#topchampions)
v
[*wit's end*](http://www.lolking.net/items/3091#topchampions)

relevant champions: warwick, nocturne:

* for all above champions wit's end had a higher win rate

* for most above champions had &gt;5% higher win rate and similarly higher purchase rate

**Conclusions in price context:** 

Most pros I've read commentary by (chauster mainly, only 3% lower than IE/PD) leads me to suspect (read: it is likely/an important possibility) wit's end is a good item in nearly all situations, and should be valued more highly.


[*sunfire cape*](http://www.lolking.net/items/3068#topchampions) v [*randuin's omen*](http://www.lolking.net/items/3143#topchampions)

relevant champions: malphite, shen, dr mundo

* malphite benefits more from sunfire cape
* amumu and shen work with both
* nautilus
* sunfire cape has a few higher % average win rate:  because of high win rates with singed

**Conclusions in price context:**

Sunfire cape costs slightly less

Previously (~a month ago, whereas randuin's was a great item, in the majority of games. However after the recent adjustments on both items, sunfire cape is now a much more viable on certain junglers.


I hope you enjoyed my mini-article; (relevant) commentary

I was able to hold him to 30cs by the end of the game, while I ended up with ~120 (short game).

I think Nautilus is one of the most dynamic characters in the game. He's right alongside Kayle as a champion that can play multiple roles while being exceptional at all of them. Aside from ranged AD

Top? Tanky stats, the ult will follow). If you can land the ult, you can easily lock down the enemy with passive proc, aa reset W, E, hook combo. Can be built to counter almost any champion top with armor/magic resist (Glacial Shroud and Wit's End respectively) and cooldown reduction (Kindlegem, Glacial Shroud). Scales well with health items and can farm easily due to passive and AOE skills. 

Mid? Not extremely good but still a strong pick in my humble opinion. Similar to top, Fizz, Mordekaiser, Talon, Kassadin) will be eaten alive by a full combo. Can roam and gank as well as anyone with hook/ult. Offers fantastic dragon control with his CC and sheer tankiness, and can invade enemy jungler alongside his own to lock down potential buffs and enemies with his amount of CC. 

Bot? Great support. Functions much like Blitzcrank with an easier ult to utilize (not neccessarily better, you are about to be CC'd). Also, can peel as well as a Blitzcrank or Leona with his passive, E, Ult, and Q. Not as good at peeling or sustain as a Janna or Soraka respectively, but can still be considered strong with the lane control he offers. Also, Kage's

Jungle. I will admit, you can easily survive it. Once you reach level 5, your W is ranked enough to allow you to take almost no damage from camps, gank well, and still survive with no need for Wriggles. As I said before: benefits greatly from GP5 items and has no need for more damage items due to how good his AOE and tank stats are. Ganks are fantastic at level 6, but still good from level 1-5 if you learn to land Q consistantly. 

Roamer. Now hear me out, Corki) you can effectively roam between bot lane and mid. I have seen a couple good Alistars do this effectively, but in my experience trying it with Nautilus is even better. Simply play a standard support until level 6 or so. If your lane is stable, your carry understands what you are doing, and you have warded correctly, feel free to roam to mid and try to grab the ap carry. Landing a hook is sometimes easier than getting off Alistar's QW combo, and has a shorter cooldown and better followup with Nautilus' passive and ult! It's more of an active support role

**WARNING: PEOPLE TO WATCH OUT FOR**

Top: Irelia, aa minions and Q to heal any damage you can deal to him. 

Mid: Ahri. True damage, and mobility (3 dashes plus flash?!) to escape even when she is ulted make this one of the hardest matchups in the game. Pray you have a good jungler or that she is a bad Ahri player, because a good one will make you cry. 

Jungle: No one can really beat you in a one on one fight once you get to level 7, Mundo, Lee Sin) can destroy you if they catch you at a bad time. Stay wary, and try to get your team to ward jungle entrances if they can. 

Bot: No one can really outright beat you down bot lane. Bot lane is more skill based than matchup based, and constant slows can beat a player who isn't being careful.

- Support may be much more fun to play (duh)
- Although Morello denies that ""rubber-banding"" will occur in games

1326840882.0,oliet,Shen - Are we playing him wrong?,FortyAPM,32,6,12,"So i saw some changes mentioned on the lol forums.  It was changes that were on the PBE that dont exist anymore.  I logged into the PBE and found that those changes were removed.  I guess they didnt like the changes that they mentioned.

One of the changes was that they added armor to his w (shield).

That got me thinking

W-&gt;E-&gt;Q

ofcourse always taking his ult first.

Well i played a few games.  The first match I had a support (alistar) bottom (ranked game).  I had to try long and hard to convince them to let me try this in a ranked game.  So we went up against ezreal and soraka.  A pretty good duo to test this against.  We were tanky bottom with no ranged abilities.  At first thought, a support to heal me, having high hp/5, armor, mr, we did not need a ranged ad to deal with their ranged ad.
http://www.leaguereplays.com/replays/match/151969/

The second match I tested this in was another ranked match, simply used to last hit minions and heal.  W took precedence over e, put points into ult as necessary.

Renekton couldnt do jack shit to me top lane.  Didnt need potions, and my q to heal ever so slightly.  We had a twitch that game that was horribly behind in levels and we still managed to win this match because I was unkillable.
http://www.leaguereplays.com/replays/match/151970/

There was one more match that I played

As far as item build
Going against ranged ad in lane, just make sure that your first item is based on teh type of damage your facing in your starting lane.

For runes, 1 flat armor quint, 2 flat mr quints.  For reds, pick up any defensive stat you want, can be flat or per level armor or MR.
For masteries


TLDR: the sustain on shen with his shield makes him an immovable object in any lane.  Combine him with another tank/support bottom (like alistar) and they will completely control the mid to late game.

1375712937.0,1jqou6,Testing of experience quints on WW,Albaek,36,10,37,"There were a few skeptic people in my recent topic on my approach to WW. Specifically

[Here is a spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AuFX8usHljhXdGZ5MGhVbURkZHRhck1nY2tDMzRESnc&amp;usp=sharing) that shows both the theory and testing.

You require 2500 experience to get level 6,11 modifier (exp quints + exp masteries), but I do in reality. The reason that I hit 6 is because jungle minions give more experience the further into the game you are. It's not a lot, and it's barely noticeable (see the bottom of the spreadsheet), but in this scenario it allows me to get level 6 one camp faster than exp quints or exp masteries alone, and two camps faster if no exp masteries or quints.

As you may see, bonus experience, CDR, movement speed and generally just a lot of good stuff by going offensive.

The difference between as and ms is to ms' favor

One could argue that ending at golems are not always ideal as it is hard for WW to gank the bot lane due to good ward coverage and ganking 2v2 lanes is hard due to how easy it is to cancel WW's ult. I agree with this to some extend. You're still a good 30 seconds ahead of regular level 6 time

Another thing to notice is that running ms quints with support masteries can be worth it as you end up at wolves, running exp quints allows you ensures both a gank as well as time to buy before the buffs respawn. It ultimately comes down to which side you play (you can see it in champion select on the ""Your team"" font). If you play blue side, then ending at golems is not the best, however at purple side being on golems can be very good. You have to remember you get 6 before most laners with this build, so you can most likely kill anything you come in contact with.

For the purpose of theorycrafting, look at my [LoLking profile](http://www.lolking.net/summoner/euw/19048861#masteries). Page 15 and 17 is the one used. Page 17 could probably be optimized a bit, but it won't change much with the clear speed. Also, Bladed Armor is quite significant to your clear time as it saves a few autoattacks so I would not advice skipping it.

As for items

1374987770.0,1j7afh,Sultan of Solo-Queue: Phoenix Udyr,Kraz226,34,9,22,"I'll try to condense this post as well as I can

**Udyr is a top tier solo-queue contender

I've started to change my ranked playstye over the last few days. I've been meandering in the doldrums of Plat 5 for a couple months

[Here's my LoLKing for anyone interested.](http://www.lolking.net/summoner/na/21630104#history)

I just wanted to list some observations I've made over the last few days. Partly for myself

* Can farm *very* hard (thanks to Phoenix) 

This skill is amazing because it's essentially a 5 second Sunfire combined with a Tiamat Cleave on activation and on every third auto attack. Not to mention the fact that it's magic damage based

Having such a great AoE skill on short cooldown and low mana costs mean you can dominate mid game if you find yourself in a solo-lane with a wave or two all to yourself. You can receive a small gold advantage from it quickly while other junglers are not nearly as fast. 

* He thrives in a frenzy

Udyr gets picked apart in a competitive play environment (usually) because teams have focus and can quickly burst him down. In solo-queue this is not the case however. Usually enemy teams aren't peeling for their ADCs

In a wonky and disjointed teamfight, deal heavy dps with Phoenix, chase down fleeing carries with Bear, and so forth. He also can build strong aura items like Frozen Heart, Aegis/Bulwark, Randuins, Locket

* Item Versatility 

Udyr is similar to Jax in that his item choices are usually custom tailored to beat his enemies. Against a big AoE magic comp? Bulwark/Wit's End/BV are viable options. AD assassins messing up carries? Grab Randuins/GA and laugh at their face. Fed Vayne? Randuins/Thornmail will make her cry. I could continue

* Dueling power

Once you get some early items

This should not be undervalued

* Doesn't suffer from power fluctuations

That's a fancy way of my saying that Udyr is the opposite of Lee Sin and J4. While both of those characters have a monster early-mid game presence

He gets better with item

* Few counters

A mobile/farming playstyle has few counters. It takes a coordinated team to realize that they need to secure objectives and force tower fights while Udyr splitpushes (much like Tryndamere). Usually a solo-queue enemy team won't realize this and will instead opt to send 1-3 people to deal with Mr.ManBearPig. This is just what you want as Udyr however

Not only is his playstyle hard to counter


**TL;DR**: Udyr can farm hard, build lots of items, and more! I've been doing well with him and just want to talk about it.

9/0/21 is what I feel to be the best mastery setup

Runes are magic pen marks, flat ap quints. This mastery setup allows for 4(+1)% at lvl 1 with w, and this is ridiculous for clearing. I'm going to try to limit the amount of flat ap glyphs though so I can run more mr/lvl, so probably 3-5 flat ap glyphs and 6-4 mr/lvl glyphs.

I go 2 early points in w then max q

As for masteries personally I'd prefer the tanky-jungler standard of 9/21/0. Runes would be preferably flat AD but I've heard of people running Armor Pen, and Armor. 

As for skill order is where this gets tricky. Nasus has a lot of freedom in choosing his skill lineup as opposed to most champs. From what I understand maxing Spirit Fire allows for the quicket clear time. Maxing Wither allows for downright brutal ganks, maxing Siphoning Strike for what I assume is for more damage against champions and not much else.

Personally I would have a point in each by level 3 and possibly max Spirit Fire first. Reason being is Nasus already has atrocious clear speed so if I could quicken it up and limit myself to wolves/wraiths I could level quicker and spend more time roaming/ganking/possibly counter jungling (don't forget

As for why people pick Nasus I think it's fairly straight forward. His ultimate grants him both HP and does %MaxHP damage over 15 seconds. His Wither is the bane of all auto attackers or more specifically AD carries. It either makes them near obsolete in a team fight or makes them easy pickings for your team to dive on. Lastly

He also fits with our meta of item builds in that he becomes absurdly tanky. Tanky aura items like Runic Bulwark and Locket of the Iron Solari are extremely cost effective and add onto Nasus's unkillable mode. Other items such as Frozen Heart, Warmogs, Sunfire, Wriggle's Lantern and possibly many more all fit in with his playstyle and kit.

So, runes, masteries, and skill order do you prefer and why?

Currently

* **Vi:** Single target damage, good health scaling (with sustain due to shield), good CC, and decent base stats make her really well rounded. Her entire kit just has so much going for it and she can build so many ways that I just love playing her. 

* **Amumu**: Still has a rediculously broken skill set. Later on in the game when he has some items finished he's a teamfight monster who never dies and can initiate easily. Even with his slow/vulnerable early game

* **Fiddlesticks**: He's got a lot of ways to make the enemies melt while keeping high health. He also wrecks teamfights just as well as Amumu if you ult and use your fear properly. He doesn't even need to build too many damage items to destroy people thanks to his passive. Twin Shadows on this guy is amazing. 

* **Hecarim**: Does shit-tons of damage while having only one or two finished items. Frozen Fist, so now he doesn't feel as useless during mid game. He just ramps up so well that it's easy to get out of control due to his movement speed, initiation ability, and even his straight up dueling power late game. I'm honestly surprised he's not used in the pro scene more often. 

* **Sejuani**: Imagine if Mundo and Amumu had a baby and that baby was an ice-lady riding a giant pig. Sejuani is in a weird place where she was designed to be a tank (her ult), so she's in a strange place in the meta. With all the S3 item changes, getting her damage into the stratosphere is as simple as having a Warmogs and a Liandry's Torment. Neither items will take the entire game to build, so you can just supplement it with some auras or tankiness and you're good to go. She's easily one of the stronger junglers in the game at the moment, but she hasn't been picked up by most junglers since she's been in the doldrums for so long. Mark my words, she's going to see a serious increase in popularity soon if people start realizing how good she is.

* **Supports** - Builds, How to Play with an AD Carry, Aggression in lane and How to Receive Ganks

* **How to Figure out any Champion** - General mechanics and Item Builds

* **Winning a Lane** - Comparing Mechanics

* **How to win a game** - Basics on Teamwork, Counter Strategies, How to respond to a fed enemy, How to keep yourself or your teammates fed

If there no love for a particular subject or if there is something not on the list that you want feel free to post! If you feel this would be better suited in Summoner School or the general League of legends sub Reddit just say. Also for any reason someone would like to collaborate with me (i have no idea why xD) on a particular subject just ask and I will most likely say yes.

I will start writing these after tomorrow and see the response to determine whether or not I should continue from the feedback. (or wont even start if the general response to this is horrific).

**Then:** Back in the day, and I achieved it using this build.

Most people have relegated GP to a class of sub-par top laners since trying to harass with Parrrley early game drains too much mana and Gangplank simply cannot win trades with most top laners. I don't think Gangplank was ever meant to win trades in his lane though. His power and advantage comes from his ability to survive and continue farming while building up more gold then his opponent. The only usefulness he lends to his team early game is his ultimate

Which brings me to the focus of our discussion: Stinger.  Perhaps the item's greatest weakness is that it only builds into Nashor's Tooth.  On it's own, it builds from two Daggers making it easy to ""curve"" into the item as the game progresses, should you choose to pick it up early.  The obvious problem, though, is the space it occupies in your inventory as late game approaches.

Is it then completely without merit?  On junglers, the space it hogs doesn't feel intrusive and there is always the possibility of upgrading it into a Tooth.

1376628380.0,1kgx8m,Let's talk about Gunblade,Rawnix,27,4,43,"So

Recently I've been playing a lot of Akali and Katarina. Both of these champions used to have Gunblade as a core item

Ahri, Jax, Tryndamere (AP), Evelyn, Gragas, Kayle (AP), Kogmaw (AP), Teemo (Hybrid)

I realize you're probably very skeptical about some of these

**Deathcap:** 120 AP and 30% increased AP (Granting a total of 156 AP)

**Gunblade:** 65 AP, 20% SV and an amazing active.

How amazing is gunblades active? It depends on which champion you're using it on. On AP Heavy champions who AA frequently, which isn't that effective on something like LeBlanc but can be extremely potent on Teemo or Kayle.

Let's take a look at it champion by champion

**Akali:** She doesnt AA much, so Deathcap is definitely a higher damage item. That being said, spellvamp on Akali is extremely powerful since she has such high burst and can easily keep her alive throughout a fight when combined with stealth. My verdict is that it's still good on her if you expect to be taking a lot of AOE damage.

**Ahri**: I'm conflicted about Gunblade on Ahri. I feel like rushing the Cutlass would give you AMAZING lane presence due to Ahri's range, so you can reset Gunblade's active relatively quickly, but at the same time Deathcap is an amazing item on Ahri. My verdict is that it would be VERY niche on her but could work in the right situation.

**Katarina**: I play a LOT of Kat. I play her both top and mid. While she does have decent AD Scaling on her ult and an ""okay"" scaling on her W, so the verdict is dont buy it.

**Jax**: I've tested it myself several times, but damn good.

**AP Tryn:** I've never played AP Tryn myself, is really strong due to his passive. I feel that rushing Cutlass would give you even more sustain in lane and confuse your enemy into building armor. Verdict: Possibly would work very well.

**Evelyn**: Eve is really strong in SoloQ right now as a tanky magic damage initiator. I'm not sure how well Gunblade would work with a build like that, waste of stats.

**Grargas**: I could see Gunblade being really strong on Grargas in lane, so that part is almost wasted. Verdict: Niche pick, but has potential

**AP Kayle**: Another champion I love

**AP Kogmaw**: Kogmaw's ultimate has decent AD scaling and he has some rather large AA range with his W up. Additionally he could reset the active on Gunblade very fast. The only problem is that Kogmaw will rarely be in range to USE the active. For this reason

**Bruiser Nidalee**: Tested over the course of several games

**Teemo**: AP or Hyrbid build's can easily include Gunblade on Teemo. It works wonders on him due to how much he AA's. People say he doesnt benefit from spellvamp much

I have to admit, just a sheen. I find its proc to be very useful without committing to the cost of the full upgrade. Next? Warmogs. This might change soon, but since his ult gives resistances, Warmogs seems like such a good idea. After that? Either upgrade sheen or build Rageblade.

1362594826.0,19sf79,Warwick actually seems strong at my level,glandyover,28,3,50,"I've been taking up champions that aren't terribly popular and I prefer the jungle so I decided to play around with Warwick to see if he felt viable.

His weakness is that he can't gank well until level 6 and you have to dive into the middle of a fight to do your role. Many of the popular junglers are so popular because they have early CC and gap closers. Warwick doesn't have either until he gets his ult. 

His big strengths are safety

**Safety** Warwick's safety in the jungle allows you to countergank efficiently. Since Warwick can take red first just as easily as blue you can take the opposite path your opponent will likely take so you can fend off their ganks. 

**Attack Speed** has become more expensive in season 3 but Warwick gives it away like candy on Halloween. Pushing towers is easy when you have a 40% attack speed buff on everybody who's attacking the turret.

**Early itemization options** Warwick only needs at most two potions to start off with. This allows you to pick up an early ward and give your teammates vision they wouldn't otherwise have. Early wards can give your teammates the heads up on an incoming gank and since your ganks are fairly lackluster pre-6 you need the ability to help out your lanes somewhat. 

Warwick is best against a poke comp since he can heal off their poke by autoattacking or Q'ing. He also has a good engage if your team can follow it up. Conversely

Warwick synergizes well with autoattacking AD carries. Graves and Corki don't get as much out of the attack speed buff as Caitlyn or Tristana will. He does very well with Blitzcrank or Thresh since they can grab an opponent while you're ulting to pull them in. 

I'm not claiming Warwick is terribly strong or overpowered but he does have strengths that go unnoticed and I wanted to bring them to the conversation.",,t5_2smhl,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/LeagueofLegendsMeta/comments/19sf79/warwick_actually_seems_strong_at_my_level/

In order to save space, so my results could be wrong, though I don't think they are.

So what's the cut-off point for needing to attack before your faster autoattacks can outdamage W's increase in magic damage? Well, in a little over 1.5 seconds. Every subsequent rank will require that you keep attacking for a little over 3 seconds. In any situation where you were going to use your W for damage against an enemy, it can be assumed that you are allowed to attack for at least 3 seconds, as you will be in melee range. This means that with this set-up, a Tristana with 5 points into Q will outdamage a Tristana with 5 points into W after 3 seconds of autoattacking. Q-first Tristana will also continue to deal more and more damage as she gains more items.

Now, which is nice in general. It deals AOE damage to clumped up enemies (though wanting to jump onto more than one enemy is very rare), and on kills and assists it resets, allowing for even more damage. In these cases, Tristana can get very high numbers for ranking W, at least 90 damage per rank, making it much stronger than Q. Getting hit by CC or Exhaust will greatly reduce Q's strength. And possibly the most important factor is that these numbers only become true once you reach 137.5 attack damage. At all lower levels of AD, though by how much of a factor I'm not sure. Lastly

However, it scales better numerically into late game, and it's a much safer spell for team fights. Once her range starts to get high, it also becomes more intelligent to kite lower ranged ADs with your 600+ range, instead of jumping onto them, though it's very difficult to maintain full attack speed while doing so. Q also works very well with Lulu (who adds 39 pure damage per autoattack with her passive at level 9) and Janna (who provides 37 pure damage while the shield persists under these conditions).

TL;DR: It's possible to max Q over W in situations where your autos are buffed by your support and you can't go all-in,,False,,t5_2smhl,False,,True

[Seeker's Armguard - In Depth Video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WbJKRDoQUiA)

My Jungle Kat revolves around two core items: Wriggle's Lantern and Seeker's Armguard.

* Seeker's: 45 armor + 40 AP fully stacked.
* Wriggle's Lantern: 30 armor (Passive + Stats is way more efficient than Spirit of the Spectral Wraith. Also
You'll be sitting around 75 bonus armor with items alone.

As for starting runes, and MR glyphs. Why AD? Her W is your main clear, and her AD ratio is higher than her AP ratio on it. (25% ap, 60% ad)

Worried about her initial clear? Most people would assume she would go red buff route, it's a 4 sec AOE clear with good damage. Combined with blue buff, it drops to a 3 second cooldown. Max W, R, and then E. I want to rush 6 ASAP, but don't ignore teammates.

I haven't had the chance to play her too much but there's a few items that I know will be good on her.

* Black Cleaver - Seems like a must buy core item in every game.
* Frozen Mallet - The slow to stick to targets
* BT / BotRK - Awesome damage for her ratios
* Maw of Malmortus - Damage


I think a standard build against the typical team would look something like Black Cleaver, Guardian Angel.  If you're snowballing you can switch out the Maw for a BT / BotRK.  The build gives you plenty of damage to dish out the pain, and a bunch of HP for her passive and resistances to keep you alive after diving into the middle of the fight.

What do you guys think?

So after playing a gew games last night here are the results!

Build order
* Wriggles
* Brutalizer
* Phage
* Tier 2 boots
* Black Cleaver
* Frozen Mallet

This build is what I really see as core on her for jungling, and I think her ganks are very strong coming from the jungle.

I also had great success grabbing a few extra wards and warding the enemy jungle for coutuner jungling purposes.  I found that as long as you save your Q to escape if necessary

Team fighting I found to be interesting.  Maybe it was a function of my being fed but I often found myself being focused in team fights.  That said I usually waited for a fight to break out and then ulted in on the AD / AP carry knocking the rest of the team away and focusing that squishy down.  I find her role to be much like Irelia

He wins all the matchups that Teemo would win, forcing them to retreat and lose a bit of cs and xp) walking behind them and killing them.

Instead of building like an AD carry though, the 4th hit will proc the chain lightning * the number of enemies hit. So if you hit 5 enemies with your ult on the 4th attack, you are gonna be dealing 550 Aoe magic damge to the enemy team in addition to your bonus AD and the stacks which will then allow you to activate Expunge. What I love about this build is that it deals a great amount of mixed damage (True from the passive, Magic from the items, and Physical from autos and Expunge). Due to the say his ultimate works, it's also viable to build things like Tiamat for that added AD for expunge and the insane amount of damage you do in teamfight when used in conjunction with your ultimate. I haven't tested it yet, but I think building a Gunblade wouldn't be a bad idea on the new Twitch. Now the reason for this isn't mainly his skills, a proc you are going to be getting a lot of with your ultimate. Additionally, better burst, at any point in time you can just Ambush and walk into the enemy jungle

I'd love it if I could get a bit of feedback.



Edit. I think a few people are getting confused, he does better damage at early levels, and scales into late game even if not fed a ridiculous amount of kills

Edit 2. I think you guys should really try him out in the top lane first before you say that he doesn't work. I think a lot of the doubt of his ability to handle champions 1 v 1 in the top lane stems from comparing him to the old Twitch.

Udyr is a beast in lane. His Q/W make him very hard to trade with, and be a good last hitter.

Bloodthirster, doran shield(very situational) and AD generally.

Making these items will improve your laning phase

Hybrid:

These help during both phases of the game.

If you don't choose a good balance of these items(and some I'm forgetting for sure) then you will maybe win lane but lose game. If you try to build too many game winning items you won't deny your lane opponent or kill him and as a result you won't really have the money to buy all of them.

1327645649.0,oytq9,Unconventional AD carries,,25,2,64,"~~TLDR - Ahri and Zilean have potential as  AD carries.~~ 

TLDR. **Ahri, Kennen, and Nidalee would do big damage if built as an AD carry.** [Did some math](http://www.reddit.com/r/LeagueofLegendsMeta/comments/oytq9/unconventional_ad_carries/c3l7t6b) on a poster's suggestion. Orianna and Kennen do enough dps to work as AD carries. Ahri *might* work, but would have a lot less dps. [More math comparing Triforce Sona to Caitlyn and Tristana in terms of dps.](http://www.reddit.com/r/LeagueofLegendsMeta/comments/oytq9/unconventional_ad_carries/c3lawbp)


I saw a tournament with AD Kennen and that got me thinking about what is actually required to be an AD carry. Since anyone with good AS stats will do huge damage with PD and IE I think AD carry is a more flexible role than it seems.

Conventional AD carries:

* Have range
* Have a strong steroid
* Have moves that scale with AD

I think the requirements for an unconventional AD carry are:

* Have range
* Have a good autoattack animation
* Can lane against conventional AD carries 
* Has some sort of utility that makes up for not having a strong steroid
* Has decent stats

Given these criteria I think  Ahri ~~and Zilean~~ could make good AD carries.


Ahri pros:

* Hard CC
* Good sustain
* Very mobile
* Good stats

Ahri cons:

* No steroid

---

Zilean Pros:

* Two lifes
* Good base dmg on skills
* Good range (600)
* Moves fast

Zilean Cons:

* Subpar auto attack animation
* No steroid 
* Low base armor. 



Out of these I think Ahri is the best candidate for a successful unconventional AD carry. Her strongest selling points are her good stats

The other unconventional AD carry with potential is Zilean. Zilean has a large range of 600. He can speed boost himself to give himself perfect positioning. He can peel enemies with his slow. He can give himself a second life with his ultimate. His bombs should give him strong lane presence. His downside is a low base armor and a wonky autoattack animation.

To give an example of a player every singed player (or league player for that matter) should know of is dyrus. If you look at his builds in lcs and soloque he has adopted the build of rushing both items and so have other pro players, he is a great player which is why he does well with singed but he just doesn't get the full effectiveness of the champion. I would much rather read a guide from a high elo stomper who only plays the champion he/she is doing a guide on, because they know the champion inside and out.

Most singed players get influenced by builds

1365361016.0,1bv72o,Hydra vs. BT on AD casters,Nonethewiserer,26,6,44,"I still see most ad casters (lets say, etc) going BT for a big AD item. 

Can we compare bloodthirster to hydra for a second?

**BT:**

70-100 AD
12-18% ls

3200 gold

Builds from BF sword and vamp sceptar


**Hydra:** 
75 ad
15 hp regen
12% lifesteal

3000 gold

Passive	
Melee only 

PASSIVE: Damage dealt by this item benefits from life steal. 


UNIQUE PASSIVE - CLEAVE: Your attacks deal up to 60% of your Attack Damage to units around your target as physical damage
Active


UNIQUE ACTIVE - CRESCENT: Deals up to 100% of your Attack Damage to units around you as physical damage

Builds out of tiamat and vamp sceptar.


Now I've recently started to build hydra on zed in situations where I would usually build bt. It has 25 less AD and less single target lifesteal (comparable overall with the splash - but i can only approximate) but the active and passive more than make up for it in my opinion. The build path is also much smoother (smaller increments in gold needed to upgrade - no 1550 chunk of gold needed for bf). It's also 200 gold cheaper.

What do you personally like? If you go BT instead of Hydra, gets a lot from the active ability. 1:1 ad scaling in an aoe is pretty damn huge to anyone whose building ad and armor pen. **I just don't see enough merits on BT to warrant buying it on ad assassins. It costs more money and it seems like it would be less damage.** 

(small hydra bonus - when paired with bc you now have aoe armor shred. probably more useful on a bruiser who buys 2 damage/3 tank items like renekton or something but thought id point out the cool synergy of these items).

I run AttSpe Red

Starting Machete 5 pots and W you can clear without ever getting low on hp.


What really got me excited was when I realized how much sustain she gets after you pick up Spectral Wraith. (Every ability heals you some but her reset ult plus short cooldown smite gives you very high sustain)


Most of the popular jungle champs currently wouldn't fair well in a 1v1 against her either because of the shield and passive additional damage every 3 strikes.


Builds would vary depending on your team comp but Spectral Wraith item would be a must. I find the Seeker's Armguards give you a nice item to hold onto until you get a chunk of cash from some successful ganks. A lot of times I will go RoA if my team needs me to have a bit of beef. (This item is also a good choice if you might/have to give up your blue for any reason)


Late game Diana gives you another bruiser style AP. I would expect her to work best with a dive comp although her Q also gives way for a pretty solid poke too.


What do you guys think? I know she is used sometimes but what makes her not a top jungle? I haven't had a lot of time to test her but I don't see any glaring weakness.

1.5 on bustershot


Add in the improved ignite mastery and it increases your lvl 2, adds 53 dmg to lvl 6 burst.

You also dont sacrifice anything in terms of laning phase AD Carry damage potential(last hitting

The only downside is the lack of early MR, ect), if you are able to land 1 or 2 auto attacks before you unleash the burst. Also her jump resets on kill so its still SOMEWHAT safe, if you're careful. You can then use the gold gain to get an early null-magic mantle to offset the lack of rune MR if you're feeling vulnerable.

You might think, and what kind of champions the enemy player in a real game would be playing. Well theres no way to supplement real players with bots however, despite all that, this kind of practice is still extremely beneficial because you get to understand every aspect of your champion better in a lane-like situation. You start to figure out in which windows you can get aggressive w/o sacrificing last hits, which last hits are safe, etc. Because the laning phase revolves almost completely around the passive art of last hitting, this kind of practice will help in ways you will understand once you try it.",False,,http://www.reddit.com/r/LeagueofLegendsMeta/comments/s6xbm/a_simple_way_to_get_betterbut_just_a_warning_this/

So basically, this is the proposed setup. 2 bot, 2 top, AP mid. Top and bottom both will consist of one ""roaming"" champion, and one champion with enough sustain to handle 1v2 for short periods of time (It may be possible Cloth Armor+5 Health Pots will be enough).

What the roaming champions will do is clear their respective side of the jungle. Whoever is on the side with Golem Buff, or Fiddlesticks.

On the side with Lizard Buff, or Udyr, or Nocturne who will also act as a bruiser. From Stonewall008's videos, it seems that the respawn on the small camps is short enough that it can provide a fair source of income throughout laning phase (and even beyond), so the champions on the red side will also act as bruisers later on in the game.

Middle will be AP, Gragas or Sion.

So what happens is that everyone goes to their specific side of the jungle - the roamers will clear their sides while the solo-ers will play defensively for the first minute or so while the jungle is being cleared. Then, or even choose to converge on middle for a three-man gank. 

After the ganks (successful or not), they will go and clear it, and resume ganking.

Season 3 seemed to be the final nail in his coffin with health-stacking all the rage and sustain4days crippling the advantage of his lane presence. Could this be the end of our hero?

Well, pokes well, pushes well, roams well, and brings Bullshit Gate to the table after all.

You want: AD reds, and AD, Arpen, or MS quints. 21/0/9 or 21/9/0 vs scary burst.

Q &gt; W &gt; R &gt; E (Do this if you practically never use hammer form to harass)  
R &gt; Q &gt; W &gt; E (If you like the hammer switch &gt; Q &gt; AA &gt; E poke/disengage)  
Q &gt; E &gt; R &gt; W (Purely for accelerated Q

Reason being is that leveling R gets you no benefits in ranged form besides slightly higher resistance shred which is useless early. Mostly you're getting burst and durability in melee form.

Flash mandatory ofc, Ghost or TP gives you more maneuverability and utility.

Items: 

Start:  
Sword/2 or boots/3 vs melee that you want to harass  
Flask/1/ward vs more balanced lanes  
9pot/2ward vs bullies and scary jungles  

Core:   
Tear &gt; Brutalizer &gt; Manamune  
You want to spam your accelerated shock blast as often as you can for as long as you can to pressure the enemy, and steal neutrals. Tear &gt; Manamune right now is extremely cost effective on anyone who can charge it quickly, proc the toggle often, and use the mana to its fullest. Brutalizer is sort of a no-brainer on Jayce when it comes to his poke and upgrades into BC or Ghostblade much later. Muramana synergizes with your W  and adds a lot to your sustained ranged damage and burst melee combo alike.

Alternatives: Doran's Blade x1-2, and very strong lane sustain  
Vamp or BF sword instead of that Brutalizer if you want a faster BT  
Hexdrinker vs LB

Boots:  
CDR 90% of the time  
Swiftness
Furor &gt; Alacrity &gt; Distortion IMO

Everything else:  
BT - best investment for raw damage and lifesteal
Upgrade Brut into BC for midgame if you have lots of physical damage and no better way to apply it (Wu
Shiv - If you're poking a lot with your W this is a great way to get damage in and improve your sustained auto dps instead of poke. Combine with BT for best results.  
Iceborn Gauntlet - excellent if you can make use of the armor. Still good if you can't. Extra push/waveclear, synergizes with Muramana, guaranteed slow on the first hit makes landing a full w so much easier.  
Warmog's - Your pokes aren't doing much but you're too squishy to throw down in fights? Mog is your friend.  
LW - After Muramana/Brut/BT this is where you go to improve your poke damage. I wouldn't bother in most cases.  
Triforce - Iceborn's ugly older brother. No guaranteed slow
IE - So you have BT
Atma - if you got Warmogs and want more armor
Maw - if you need MR.  
GA - 2 Ryze from ur Graves.

The gameplay is quite simple. Poke hard, roam, push towers (dat w), force objectives, and generally fuck shit up from out of range. Steal buffs. Ward their wraiths and last hit em with Q. Just fucking ward excessively, you're shit if you get caught so stay guerilla 4 life. Use form switching to charge tear when running anywhere or farming solo. Use your mana regen in melee + tear + flask to spam without a care in the world.

Specifically, and disengage. He does well vs squishy APs in lane because he balls so hard with shock blast. He can handle mobile assassins by exploiting his range. Jayce is crazy versatile and deserves a second look from those who thought him dead in the water.",,False,,t5_2smhl,False,,
1359166483.0,17alhu,Let's talk about Ashe.,spirited1,27,5,55,"First of all, Ashe is at a noticeably large disadvantage to countering these playstyles. While Ezreal has his blink

Let's talk about her kit:  
[Passive] - Focus: Ashe's critical strike chance increases by 3 / 6 / 9 / 12 / 15 / 18% every 3 seconds while not attacking. Focus' bonus is expended with her next basic attack.  

[Q] - Frostshot: TOGGLE: Ashe's basic attacks slow her targets for 2 seconds. (15%/20%/25%/30%/35%)  

[W] - Volley: ACTIVE: Ashe fires 7 arrows in a cone, regardless if it is toggled on or not. 

[E] - Hawkshot: PASSIVE: Ashe gains bonus gold whenever she kills a unit or destroys a structure.
BONUS GOLD: 1 / 2 / 3 / 4 / 5
ACTIVE: Ashe animates a hawk to scout for her

[R] - Enchanted Crystal Arrow: ACTIVE: Ashe fires a large arrow in a straight line. If it hits an enemy champion

Looking at her kit, in any efficient way use her passive. The only time her passive will be of use is a level one cheese play or after returning to lane from shop. When team fights begin to happen, she's not going to sit around charging her passive. As an alternative, her passive could charge on AA. They could go a Tryndamere like path where each shot charges up her chances of getting a critical strike, or perhaps a Caitlin like approach where after  certain amount of shots she has an elevated chance to crit or a 100% chance to crit.

Her Q, Ashe's arrows will apply a small slow for 2 seconds. While this is effective at kiting, a lot of champions now have gap closers or some kind of CC. It is also barely noticeable until she ranks it up more. During teamfights it's relevance is increased, allowing the team to catch a straggler or slowing down the enemy bruiser before they can reach her. However, this may force Ashe to leave the fight (which is an effective, viable counter if Ashe becomes a nuisance). A possible way to enhance this ability would be to allow Ashe to have a slight MS boost while toggled (draining mana constantly, and having no mana cost for each individual shot however) would allow the slow to be more effective for kiting and allowing a bit more mobility in her kit while also causing her to watch her mana and use it effectively.

Ashe's E is what bothers me the most. While it can be incredibly useful at times, by which point you will most likely not be farming anymore, you decided to max it first to maximize farming, or somehow have exactly equal farm to the enemy adc and manage to buy a BF sword first. Even worse, it also has no synergy with her passive. Each shot gives her gold, so why should she wait for her passive instead of farming? I know this ability was reworked many times, but honestly it's really bad. Perhaps the cool down could be shortened as it is ranked higher so it's relevance late game would be increased

Her R, and I consider it one of the best ults in the game when used properly. It can be used as an engage, to snipe a low health enemy, or if you're really skilled, to save another lane across the map (so satisfying to hear ""Nice shot Ashe"" :D). I feel her R is very good on her, but this is no reason to leave the rest of her kit in bad shape.

What are your opinions on Ashe?

Disclaimer: All of my ideas should be taken with a grain of salt. Please consider my opinion thoughtfully and offer your ideas if you disagree, she should still be considered for an upgrade.

1357559750.0,1646wf,Starting Red Elixir on Riven,Vaethin,29,7,52,"So

Let's take a look at the *possible starting items*: 

**Boots + 3/4Pots**  - not viable in my opinion

**Flask + Pots + Ward(s)** - not viable because Riven doesn't use mana.

**Only Pots and Wards** - Pretty good but the fact that Riven plays very aggressive early and one of the laners will probably go back very soon makes the huge amount of potions overkill.

**Longsword +2x potion**: Makes you very prone to ganks because you have neither boots nor wards. Does however have the fastest development into lategame (longsword builds into Brutalizer or Vamp Scepter).

**Armor + 5 Pots** - pretty much the 2nd best option

**So

**When to do this**: Against strong laners that outlane you early like Olaf or Darius. With the additional mojo from Red Elixir you'll be able to outtrade them early. What this does is take their strongest feature away: Standing in the creeps and harassing you

**Disadvantages**: Only that you waste your initial 475g all on consumables. On your first trip back you should be able to get Boots + 1x doran's anyways (350+475g=825g). 

How does this *compare to other starts*? 

* **Boots**: It's worse, but all that is just theorycrafting because most of the time you'll get crushed if you go boots these days (most people go armor)

* **Armor**: Almost the same sustain but a lot less sustain if you go for a ward. Also armor doesnt really build into anything but armor boots so even though you spent 300g in items those are not really building into your core items yet.

* **Longsword** : Slightly stronger trading, you have a jungler who starts red while you're on red team and you're thus unable to do one of the little camps for early Level 2.

Anyways

So there I was, Teemo (oh gawd Bulwark), Nidalee and (surprisingly) Veigar. None of which seemed to stand any chance. With Kat I could just eat her burst with my shield then land an easy QE combo and almost always come out on top. I can also zone her with my Q and E and if she ever tries to roam I can have her tower in no time (sometimes it doesn't matter if she's roaming or unloading on me, I've had times where we were almost even in farm and I just sat through her full combo with ~2/3 hp left and kept taking tower). With Teemo, obviously, I can just max W second and his attacks/shrooms will only heal me. With Nid I can usually just push and if I take a damage I can have a stroll to the nearest bush, step on her traps and heal up (and if she doesn't trap I can have the jungler gank with better chances). And finally, it seems like no one can stop me from taking the tower and any roaming from the enemy will almost invariably result in their tower going down before they get back.


Along with good lane match ups against popular champs (and pretty much any AP outside them) Galio is almost ungankably tanky. If I have a ward in the river and stick to that side there are few ganks I can't brush off or simply avoid with my speed boost/slow.


Finally, which are always good in a team fight. And finally he packs a massive shield (90 armor and magres for 4 seconds!) which basically means either your initiator will take heavily mitigated damage from the enemy try to burst him down or your ADC/APC (depending) won't have to worry about harass nearly as much. It also keeps you up on HP no matter who you place it on which means you can stay in the fight and keep tanking/dealing damage/applying CC for your team.


So I'm wondering


EDIT: After reading the comments it looks like a lot of people like Galio, the nerfs to MR (runes, items, etc), nerfed AP ratios, difficulty to land Q, issues farming and the rise of AD casters.
1. I honestly haven't had any issue with his early game. Most of the time I can just farm and if the enemy tries to attack they generally put themselves in a place (like their abilities have a cast animation or, the former of which is usually solved by playing somewhat passive until about lvl 4 and the latter is scarcely even a problem, I tend to just consume the next wave at ~500g and go back for my chalice, pots and a ward. Early game hasn't been an issue for me thus far.
2. I hadn't been playing this game with any degree of seriousness until something like 3 months ago, is a great item for him that didn't exist before). 
3. This one does sound like something of an issue
4. True, 1v1ing you or you're in a team fight. If they're chasing you then, again, them dodging the Q would likely have the same end result of a slow on then. If they're 1v1ing you and you can't land your Q, then you should probably leave and if they chase you refer to the previous sentence. And, in a team fight, most won't have time to dodge it/will be too busy with other things to react in time.
5. I don't even know where this one came from
6. This is the big one I think. AD casters in all their new glory are quite the opposite of what Galio thrives on

Over all: I think the issues with lowered MR in general, as for MR, there are still a lot of great items (Abys, Runic Bulwark, Athene's, etc) for MR and Galio's great farming seems to make up for their apparent expensiveness. AD casters are still an issue, but if you're last pick and they didn't grab Talon/Panth/the like I'd say Galio is a strong pick for almost any AP mid (the only issue I still see past the ADs are things like Karth because of your desire to farm and his late game power). Feel free to tell me I'm stupid for any part of this

I see a lot of people lamenting the fact that he only gets to buy 5 items because of his passive, but even as is I think any of his augments are very strong.


As promised in the title

*******************************************

A couple things to note
All my stats are either from [the preseason items site

All stats are given for level 18 and not all stats are included

Finally

1. Everyone who plays Viktor (other than me) plays with it

2. Even if you don't play Viktor

********************************

So

**Augment: Power --**

I've never seen a good thing said about this augment. I understand this point of view: it's making a burst mage into a tank

Not with Viktor: you can build, which is hilarious and totally viable.

*Example Build:*

1. Augment: Power

2. Sorcerer's Shoes with the Furor enchantment (get the enchantment as soon as you can)

3. Liandry's Torment

4. Rylai's Crystal Scepter

5. Rabadon's Deathcap

6. Void Staff

*Stats:*

* HP: 2709

* Health Regen: 24.45 per 5

* Mana: 1140

* Mana Regen: 15 per 5

* MS: 380 (may be 390 with the S3 buffs

     * This is increased by 30% for 3 seconds upon casting Power Transfer (due to Augment: Power) and a further 12% that degrades over 3 seconds once PT hits its target (from Furor enchantment).

     * These two buffs briefly give Viktor 501 MS (that's the max before the Furor buff starts degrading)

* AP: 492.5

* mPen: 40% + 30 flat

**Playstyle:**

As I've previously mentioned

This build focuses on kiting and burst damage with a q that hits like a train

*In lane:*

Max Power Transfer (q) first and Death Ray (e) second. Stay back and farm

As soon as you have the gold

1. Wait for you opponent to come forward to engage you. As soon as they do, this means that you'll be moving away surprisingly fast, and your opponent will probably miss their retaliation. If they don't, the shield will almost certainly block what little they do manage to get off.

2. Slowly get closer and closer to your opponent while farming

Once you've gotten your boots and the Furor enchantment this gets even more fun, a 42% MS boost. ZOOOOOOOOOOOM!

Now say you want a kill. You can either:

1. Go as before

2. Let your opponent push a little past the halfway mark

*Alright

In teamfights, making them burn spells trying to catch you.

If you want to initiate

If you don't initiate then walk up

**TL;DR for A:P --** Build items that give HP &amp; AP

**************

**Augment: Gravity --**

This augment is more support-oriented, it really lends itself to controlling your lane and screwing up teamfights for the enemy.

*Example Build:*

1. Augment: Gravity

2. Sorcerer's Shoes with Alacrity enchantment

3. Athene's Unholy Grail

4. Archangel's Staff

5. Rabadon's Deathcap

6. Void Staff

*Stats:*

* HP: 1789

* Mana: 2340

* Mana Regen: 45 per 5 + 1% per 1% missing + 12% of max restored on kill or assist

* mPen: 40% + 15 flat

* MR: 50

* CDR: +25%

* AP: 467.75

* 30% additional cast range on Gravity Well (w)

**Playstyle:**

This is the long-range utility/harass/support Viktor. As you may notice

*In lane:*

Max your e first (I assume you're good enough to hit it 75% or more of the time, ult when possible, and w last.

Stay back and poke with your e at its max range. Most people are REALLY bad at dodging it

Once you have enough gold to (again

If you want a kill or two

1. Walk back to lane and farm like usual until level 6

2. Then, and drop it on them, ideally so that they're centered in it: unless they flash, they'll be stunned. Then, e while walking up&gt;q&gt;r immediately after GW's stun wears off&gt;ignite&gt;e/q/AA for the kill, chasing a little if you have to.

After you kill them a couple times they'll realize that they need to stay the fuck back

1. They'll stay the fuck back. Make sure they do by keeping them off creeps with the hilarious zone control of your w and e. Obviously keep the river warded so that you know when someone's coming to gank you, then cleaning up with q&gt;e&gt;ignite&gt;chase them with ult).

2. They'll call for their jungler to camp the lane. This is a bit more problematic because you'll burn through mana like nothing else trying to hold a 2v1 lane, and Archangel's ASAP. This'll fix your mana issues and give you the ability to keep them at bay indefinitely with your zone control. Don't expect to get kills in this situation unless you're already stupidly fed (if you already have A:G, boots 2, and Athene's and/or Archangel's by the time the jungler starts camping you're probably gonna be fine).

*Alright

Now you stay at the back of your team. The huge range on your e and w make it so that you can assist from at the back

If you want to initiate, or force the enemy team into a teamfight in which they're now disadvantaged.

For any other initiation

**TL;DR for Augment: Gravity --** You have all of the range

**************

Now I did say that I think his passive could use a little tweaking

A:D makes Viktor a glass cannon

A:G makes Viktor more support-oriented

A:P makes Viktor tankier and harassment-focused. To make it synergize better with this style

It should also give 5AP/lvl instead of 3 (90 vs 54 AP @18).

I don't care if they're still good or not, by late game, playing as either of those two champions, I feel worthless. They were my go to picks against sona, as the heals and shields used to counter sona pretty well. now, it feels like Janna shield can be poped by a single auto attack

_________________________________________________________________________

What worries me, have bearable defensive stats to let them trade in mid lane, and most have good CC that works well throughout the entire game, regardless of items. (The same reason Taric, Leona, and Alistair still seem to work alright)

As a result I figure I should expect a lot more mid champions move into bot lane. who knows maybe in the near future I'll be playing against an Elise in bot lane. She seems to have some useful support traits

So what are your thoughts Reddit? do you think we're going to see a growth of AP supports? or do you think riot's promise of letting supports get more gold will let support players feel stronger late game,False,,t5_2smhl,False,,,t3_1246ho
1351122930.0,121bgp,Understanding Itemization (and the Katarina debate specifically),pengu1nz,21,1,22,"**This post was written as a response to someone else who responded ""Deathcap first Kat is always better

Background - There are two setups for Katarina that are often debated:

* 9/21/0 defensive spec

* 21/9/0 offensive spec, etc. Plays cautious, poke oriented mid. DFG is only purchased if lane is 100-0 able.

* TnA is shorthand for [TiensiNoAkuma](http://www.lolking.net/summoner/na/398435)

* Why should my opinion on Katarina matter? I've only played ~40 games as Katarina since the rework (I played her like mad in normals before they reworked her as I was never confident enough to avoid CC in ranked games) but in those 40 games I've raised from 1910 rating to my peak now of 2289

TnA plays kat as a late game team fighting machine

I and many others play a different Kat that peaks during the midgame, building mPen items like Abyssal/Haunting to become more of an AP cleanup bruiser. I'd argue that for the majority of players, this build is superior because it has a greater margin of error - if you fuck up your combo you'll still most likely survive. Maxing W in lane faster makes CSing a lot easier and lets you shove to roam faster. The tradeoff for this build, as TnA actually references in his last video, is that you cannot deal nearly as much damage. Your late game is severely delayed and you rely on your snowballed teammates to help you end the game if you don't get enough champion lasthits. 

Neither of these kat builds are ""better""; they're both different niches that you need to actually understand the champion to choose from. Laning against a Karthus who is dominating your sidelanes and it looks like you need to carry late game? Don't go 9-21

TL;DR If you don't want to read a wall of text don't read it. Just make sure you build situationally and I cannot emphasize that enough.

I've been running into this a lot recently - discussions about item choices or summoner spells that get sidetracked early because people are arguing over the use of the word ""good.""

Riot did a pretty great job at giving the player a ton of options to customize their champions.  Different items, and masteries can be combined to suit your role or playstyle.  You get value out of almost any item choice, with very few exceptions.  You can see this from the extreme flexibility of some champions (e.g. Gangplank), or why people can play troll builds and still do well.  In short, **almost every build choice helps make the champion stronger in some way**.

The problem is that **item builds are ""bad"" because of opportunity cost (what you give up from other options), by getting that extra health and passive, you're *giving up on the damage you'd have if you bought an IE instead*.  This is why people say Clarity is bad.  This is why you don't build damage on your supports, you don't stack Archangels, and you don't get GP10 items on everybody.  In order to label item builds as good or bad, you have to **compare what you're trying to accomplish with the potential alternatives**.

**tl;dr - build choices are ""bad"" because other things are better

**More in-depth example + theorycrafting 101 below:**

If you're a ranged AD carry, AND crits for days.  So now, we weigh the other benefits of FroMal versus IE to see how they compare:

**Frozen Mallet**

* 20 AD
* 700 HP
* 30% slow on every AA (40% for melee

**Infinity Edge**

* 80 AD
* 25% Crit Change
* +50% Crit Damage

The AD balances itself out easily - IE is +60 AD over FroMal.  So we're left with the rest - how does 700 HP and 30% slow compare to 25% crit chance and +50% crit damage?  It's we could try to view this empirically without lots of math (which is totally doable, well, ranged, so survivability is less important.  The slow is a nice bonus, good for chasing down those stragglers, but **chasing down stragglers is not as important as doing da damages**.

In this case, the alternative would be Phantom Dancer for the AtSpd and Crit chance (which IE loves so very much), and we immediately see that doing more damage with PD is more important than tanking with FroMal.  So on and so on, until we're left with the standard AD carry build - IE, PD, LW, etc,,True,t3_sb3us

I wrote [before] (http://www.reddit.com/r/summonerschool/comments/1fk5id/how_to_get_more_from_your_solo_que_team/) on general rules for coordinating your team of random strangers you know nothing about. Today, with Level 1 ""strats.""

* I wrote about my favorite L1 ""strat, but that's it.

* Another very popular invade was to leave from the river bush near blue buff at 1:37 or so, but can still be useful. If you bring the jungler with you there is potential to steal the buff, otherwise you can 1: try to go for kills or 2: make the leash realllly difficult. Going for kills involves more risk/reward, while simply harassing them as they try to leash can usually be done quite safely, and essentially for free (what else are you going to do during that time?). Again, all this really requires is some communication during select, or even once the game starts.

* **A very rare invade** (that a friend of mine showed me) I have run a couple of times (and never seen anyone else do) requires 2 people, instead go to the bush by wraiths. When the enemy jungler comes through, jump him, and if you get a kill you will set him back into the stone age. As long as someone has ignite, and there is 1-2 forms of CC (the jungler will be L2) it's usually not that difficult. The danger of doing this invade with total strangers is that the kill might flash away to their nearby tower, and they might flash after, giving up a kill themselves. If you tell them not to do so ahead of time, you can make it incredibly difficult for them to clear their jungle

* One strat that was used every game in pre-30 matches, and you don't want to invade, just run to your lanebush to jump the enemy when they come. As always with L1 strats (and LoL in general) the way to make this work is to be satisfied with a small edge. Maybe you don't even force a flash, but if you burst someone down to half that will make laning considerably easier, and will give your team instant pressure. Again, **Talk in select, it's free time that Riot gives you.**

* The last L1 ""strat"" is lane swapping. I'm not sure why I don't see this more often in Solo Queue, and ranged supports are much better than melee ones because they can harass under tower. As long as the 2v1ers know they should be harass heavy, as well as pushing their lane (probably focusing more on pushing than harassing, as long as they can deny farm) and 1v2er knows they mostly just needs to stay alive and grab what farm they can.

**The glory of L1 strats is that the are incredibly simple (since everyone only has 1 skill plus summoners) and you can plan them out during select, while others just know about them. If you put these into practice regularly you will learn to work out the kinks, and can begin to get most of your games off on the right foot, because not only will this give you a physical edge (debilitated jungler, weakened lane, early kills, etc.) but it will get your team to have more confidence in each other, etc.

If this seemed overly simple, as long as you talk in select (as I'm mentioning intentionally for the 50th time), you can pull them off very successfully. Tomorrow should be a bit more complex as we discuss the early stages of the game.

If someone who is good on the math would elaborate on the impact of changing to 45% instead of fixed damage on Q that would be appreciated.

What’s your opinion on the changes?

I ran him attack speed reds, and movespeed quints. I ran 0 21 9 jungle tank masteries...though I am contemplating 9 21 0 masteries as I tend to be a support jungler and hand off buffs to laners as soon as I can...thereby not needing the increased buff duration as much as more attack speed / arpen. 

Skilled E first as it can serve as an auto attack reset if you time it right...taking q at level two for a gank on top or mid. I prioritized R W Q E. Built machete / 5 pots first. My build order was spirit stone, and pink wards as often as possible as I had the income for them. Definitely not a farming jungle, I ganked lanes as often as possible, often picking up oracle to clear wards out of lanes for ganks. 

I think that jungle Blitz requires a damage heavy team to make up for his relative lack of damage...but one pull can change a team fight drastically. He also needs a damage heavy team to really lock down buffs / dragon / baron. He requires protection and a strong leash on blue to start but can impact lanes ganking so greatly that counter jungling isn't too problematic. I had only 41 farm in the game but made up for it going 2 0 10 during laning.

1368405164.0,1e7q3r,Detailed analysis on melee ADCs,tigerbloodz,34,14,32,"For reference

http://www.playdota.com/heroes/faceless-void


In LoL


The main reason melee carries work in Dota is a combination of itemization


For items


For stats and abilities, in addition to the normal benefits from increasing your stats (more hp/hp regen and armor/attack speed respectively), you are also doing more damage via auto-attacks. Abilities do not scale in Dota either, so heroes who are able to shut down carries early to mid game will fall off once the game goes late.


The toolkits melee carries have in Dota also allow them to carry successfully. Juggernaut &amp; Lifestealer have a built-in BKB. Kunkka has an initiate ability as his ultimate combined with splash damage. Sven has cleave


In short, Riven, Jax, Akali  and Tryndamere are closer to DotA's melee carries than the glass cannons that LoL calls melee carries are. Tryndamere has the potential to be great because he can actually survive long enough to put out his damage while being able to CC the enemy and constantly gapclose but remains balanced because of items like Frozen heart and Randuins.

Don't get me wrong, but i'd rather have a tanky peeler like Jax or Sejuani than someone who dives in head first who may or may not kill the enemy ADC.

To quote ""demonryder""

&gt;sure
A carry can do fine in lane, a generic madc, he has no way to live in a fight considering his only survival option causes him TO STOP DEALING DAMAGE. That is bad design. Good design would be sion style, but it was never balanced. He has the characteristics of a good carry, but there has never been balance for him. Theoretically, if he were balanced, sion could deal with autoattacks because of his passive damage reduction, and he would survive fights because of his massive lifesteal and shield. That's good design

&gt;Mundo, Olaf, GP, Sion, and Tryn, for example, are all designed so that they could be a good melee ADC
Mundo was designed so that he could be able to run around the fight and not take too much damage while ignoring cc and be able to dps down people
Yi was designed to be able to run around the fight and get kills and be able to protect himself with meditate while he lost focus so he could go for another kill

&gt;Fiora just lacks number buffs and her parry or w/e it is called is laughable. 1 hit. woo. You run in with fiora and try to do cheese damage with her ulti and tiamat or hydra
Olaf had good design for an adc but he was built with hp in mind

&gt;GP was fine for a good period of time but he just got hit from too many number nerfs to the point where there are just better characters than him. His only decent build is tank at this point so that he can just aura spam and help the team as a support really.
Sion had good design for a generic carry but his numbers were put in a bad position and never touched because Riot doesn't like him because of his stun and decided to ignore him for over a year.
Tryn is the best out of all of them because his ult is good

&gt;As to your point of the carries being an assassin, so even if they get cc'd they already got their combo out and can run away and come back for another combo. Compare zed to yi. Both of them have mechanics that allow them to avoid damage and get away, but yi has to stand still and be vulnerable while he attacks while zed can just do the combo on the adc, kill, and gtfo. Big difference. An adc is designed with a kit in mind to allow him to attack people through tankiness and cc (see sion). It's similar to a bruiser, but bruisers have high numbers and scalings on their abilities rather than the ability to get a bunch of hits in, like a mix of assassin and adc. You seem to misunderstand the definition of carry by saying they make a good kill lane. These characters play just like a ranged carry but are melee. They are weak early and should be the dominant force late game


So we know why they don't work : now we could scrap the role all together and continue to have our stale meta OR we can try to make them viable,Sion and old AP Trynd) while changeing the way stats work overall.For instance, Critical Strike would also provide 10 health and 1 armor for every  point (melee only) but bruisers wouldn't be able to utilize this mechanic as well because of the lack of AA steroids while someone like Yi would be significantly tankier thanks to this.


Another solution could be adding LoL's own version of BKB. It's doesn't take a genius to know that Guardian's Horn was an item ment to test out the viability of MADCs and experiment on how it could work on a map where teamfights are constant.Why not implement an item with negative stats to deter bruisers while bringing sustained damage??  

&gt;For example:

&gt;Guardian's Blade (Melee only):

&gt;-200 health
&gt;-10 armor
&gt;+45 AD
&gt;+10% lifesteal
&gt;+12% crit

&gt;Build path BF sword + Vamp scepter + Avarice blade = 2800 gold cost

&gt;Unique Active (Beserker's Mark) : On activation, taunts, fears, silences, blinds and immobilizes by 75% by for 3 seconds (120/90/60 cooldown)

&gt;Unique Passive (Spirit Charge) : Every 100 auto attacks or ability  uses within 600 range passively give you 1 Spirit Charge (1 second cooldown) when you reach 100 spirit charges
Beserker's Mark's cooldown is reduced by 30 seconds - this only works up to 3 times.

&gt;Your Spirit Charges would be gauged as a passive similar to Static Shyv's Icon.

The negative health would deter bruisers because they wouldn't have the DPS to sustain themselves and make up for their negative health therefore

**Bash is a passive ability that gives a unit a chance to deal bonus damage and stun its target on attack**.

How would this effect someone like Fiora? Let's say every 7 attacks or ability uses she bashes a target for .3 seconds: 

* She could be able to Q (Lunge) at a escaping enemy (2/7 charges) 

* then proceed to auto attack them with her W active (5/7) 

* then reflecting an enemy auto attack (6/7) then allowing her next attack to bash 

* then after bashing she ultimates to once again proc her bash. (7/7)

She could be able to retain her long cool-downs and stick to a target while dealing some decent damage and her extreme squishyness.Seems fair

**Remember this is theory crafting and I think it's time we  work for melee ADCs to have a fighting chance competitively**.

**PROS**

Grog Soaked Blade works as a stacking slow during skirmishes and engages.

Parrrley, translating to 10 gold/10 seconds (best case scenario).(IMO this is the best part about support GP, this mechanic allows him to farm gold better than any other support)

Remove Scurvy can be used to bait out CC and to sustain you while in lane.

Raise Morale acts as a move speed and attack damage buff to you and nearby allies.

Cannon Barrage offers a global presence

**CONS**

Melee champion

Can't sustain his ally at all

Ultimate can be unreliable for damage if the RNG is not in your favor.

**RUNES**

I've been using AD reds

**MASTERIES**

I run 0/13/17, reduced damage and reduced slows in defense, and taking standard support points in Utility down to the pick pocket mastery.

**SKILLS**

I start Q/W/E, I use it for the pickpocket gold and to apply a stack of my passive slow.

**ITEMS**

Item start is standard for any support; I begin with the biscuit and explorer ward, 2 health pots and 1 mana pot.  First trip back I try to get Philosopher's stone and sight stone, second trip back is upgraded sight stone, boots and any piece of Aegis that can be afforded.  Runic Bulwark is my first big item rush, followed by a Kindlegem to be turned into either Shurelya's or Locket, both of which should be purchased by the end of the game.

**DISCUSSION**

**CHAMPION SYNERGY**

This is where I would like to get some discussion going.  I like to compare support GP to support Nunu, and only an average support when paired with many others.  GP and Nunu's kits are very similar; they both have a damage poke on their Q, a self heal, and an ally buff; Nunu's offers attack speed while GP's offers attack damage.  For this reason, Nunu works best with champs that already have damage buffs, while GP would work best with champs that already have attack speed buffs.  For this reason, Tristana, Miss Fortune, and maybe Varus are the champions that I would pick into a GP support lane because they can buff their own attack speed and make good use of the additional damage that GP provides.  The laning phase should consist of you using Q every time it is up, and the mana regen through charm and masteries/runes is plenty to keep me capped off.

The big draw for me to picking GP as a support is the amount of gold that I can safely farm

**TL;DR** Pickpocket mastery and Parrrley allow you to farm up gold faster and safer than any other support.

His damage items are always only Iceborn Gaunlet

His tank items include Iceborn Gauntlet

Gauntlet, and its adds up to 40% CDR

Yorick is a champion that scales well with CDR, because his ghouls have 35% of his AD and HP. BUT Yorick's Ghouls can only auto 3 times in their life span and can only live up to 5 seconds. Q has a 5s CD at lvl 5, W has a flat 12s throughout, and E has a 6s CD at lvl 5.

40% CDR makes his his Q a 3s CD, not to mention his ult which would be a 54s CD (all at lvl 5). His Q or E won't ever live the full 5 seconds in a teamfight due to AoE and other factors but Q and E will basically wont have any down time. R at a 54s CD can help you take a free turret down. More Ghouls you have active, the more likely you'll have your 5%-15% DMG Reduction and auto dmg increased.

Maybe, and Lizard gives MRegen, Free DMG, and Buff Control at a lower price.

720g for 40 armor or 40 mr and turns into Glacial or Spirit Visage Respectively, but then again Yorick loses farm after mid game because of his lack of wave clear.

Darius and Teemo wreck Nasus still without considerable help from the jungle. Darius out-trades you substantially

Other tops that probably counter Nasus now but I haven't seen yet would be Malphite, but this is pure speculation for me at this point.

**Easy Lanes**

So far

**Items**

Nasus still needs some sustain outside of attacking, runes, masteries, or something else, but I've found ~30% to be good enough and I usually stop there and pick up a BF sword to keep damage up (and annihilate the squishies in a team fight).

Boots are entirely situational, Swiftness, or maybe Ionian. After the BF sword, Nasus needs tankiness, so depending on if there's already an Aegis on your team, Warmog's was next, after which I'd complete the BF into Bloodthirster (maybe IE) and then GA.

**Runes and Masteries**

I've been running 9-21-0, move speed quints, armor or health yellows, and magic resist blues. Nasus requires some kind of tankiness in his build, so I'm simply trying to compliment that here. Probably lots of better options out there, but again, this has worked for me.

I understand flat magic pen is fantastic early game where people don't have a lot of MR and the early AS is a huge damage increase.  It just seems to me that since MS is so difficult to itemize for (Lich Bane, and Ghostblade Active are the only non boot sources I can think of) and how squishy carries are late game the extra movement speed would help out so much more than 20% AS or 20 magic pen.

1349465950.0,110af5,Why can't i jungle?,Quasid,26,7,22,"So

I decided i wanted to jungle. I really like the idea of jungling

I really love jungling. But i've been hitting a brick wall and i wanted to solicit the community. 

The problems i see: 

Ganking. I don't know how to do it

Mid my problem tends to be that **I** can get into a good position, deal my damage, and chase them down. They get to the tower with 40% HP left and my mid never did anything to them. Because of this, i try to wait until their mid will get past the middle of the river, then go. But at this point, our mid just sits at tower and CS's and the gank fails. If i go before this point, their mid just trots off like nothing happened. 

As for top

**What i'd like to do**
Counter jungling: I'm scared to counter jungle

Counter ganking: I love the idea. No freaking clue how to pull it off. It seems like enemy junglers are too random to be able to accurately counter-gank unless they're standing on a ward (which

So, SV, hotshot, ect) but i feel like i can't apply their tatics to my games. I'm hovering in the mid to low 1600's now. Getitng an oracles and clearing wards isn't enough to make the enemy bot lane play passive and lose CS. Flash- twisted advancing an enemy midlane just leaves me out there getting them to 40% while my mid picks their nose. 

I know this is a long post

**Questions**
1) How to gank a lane? When is best to gank a lane? How do i get my lanes to not play like morons when i gank? (i.e. just standing so far back they can't help OR just going balls deep for no reason and giving me away.) 

2) When is it worth it to counter-jungle? When should i look to get oracles? 

3) How much of my time should i spend farming my jungle

1348680060.0,10ikiv,The jungle then versus bottom lane now discussion.,cactusfag,24,5,24,"I'm a 1100-1550 ELO player who currently mains jungle. I started ranked last March

In late August I decided to go back to tryharding in ranked and stop fucking around. After watching several streams and analyzing statistics I felt that jungling was the best way to climb elo. Since the jungle rework it has been balanced to offer a wide variety of roles and champions and build paths for any situation. Which has since proven true as I've maintained some pretty ridiculous winrates.

The point in this is that, Lee sin/Udyr/Warwick were pretty much seen every (serious) game, there was some nocturne played. This pretty much remained the same for awhile after the jungle was reworked with a few exceptions.  Shyvana and Mundo started to emerge, they didn't really evolve into high tier picks until they saw frequent play in tournaments.

So, Nautilus was released, Nunu got buffed into viability, Xin got reworked, Diana came out, Cho'Gath jungle reemerged. What I really like about a lot of these junglers is that had you picked them 2-3 months before they gained popularity somebody in your team chat would say something along the lines of “Jungle _____? What the FUCK..” What I love is now there is so much stuff you can do. Agressive early ganking? Jungle farming? Roaming cc ganker? Counter jungler? Buff and objective control? etc.

As the jungle has developed over past year, but besides that I feel that Riot has done a pretty good job at not continuously fucking with the jungle. (Besides Alistar my love). I can understand a bit though, one true balance problem that has come out of the jungle is that Riot releases junglers and people just take them top/midlane and wreck face because they can use abilities to instagib the creep wave and then dominate their opponent, not to mention since they have jungle kits they assist ganks SO WELL for their junglers. (Looking at Diana and Rengar here.)

So what am I going at here? I don't even know, funneling gold into an AD carry is just so rewarding that an AD carry is just a must-have for every team comp. We saw some evolution when Urgot emerged, but he got nerfed out of viability by Riot. This is all written pretty badly and I'm very sorry I've had a long day haha..

* Glacial Shroud - Has a LOT of mana and armor
* Zeke's - A solid item, CDR and Life steal. Some recent posts show it to be a solid item relative to cost; but assassins need more burst, not more sustained damage (I realize this is an argument against CDR also).
* Brutalizer - Already an early game staple
* Ionian boots - Great boots
* Randuins - Purely tank item.
* Shureleya's - Solid support item
* Spirit Visage - Has a place in some champions' builds
* Stinger - Offers solid CDR for a cheap price

Why not add a new build path for Brutalizer AND Stinger? They both offer CDR, and they both suffer from having poor build paths. 

* Brawler's Arsenal
* Combined from Brutalizer
* 35 Attack Damage, 20 Armor Penetration.

It offers a new source of Armor pen that could be obtained somewhat early game. It gives AD carries and assassins a MUCH needed source of CDR. It offers a new item that could help an ADC that is behind in lane since it packs early game strength with an attractive late game build path.

Last hitting is the skill that benefits the most from out-of-game practice, it’s really important to drill the heck out of your last hitting techniques and squeeze every last CS out of the lane.

I try to practice my last-hitting at least once every time I log in.  I’m not that strict about it, as Morello would says, it’s what separates the good AD carries from the great ones).  Intelligent practice is always better than “just playing” – pro athletes practice drills and scenarios, never a full game.

Here are all of the last-hitting drills I run (although I might have missed one or two):

**Item Choices**

* Pick different starting items – Dorans vs. Boots1 vs. Vamp vs. Cloth vs. nothing (these depend a bit on whether you’re alone or not – vamp/cloth might as well be nothing if you’re not getting harassed)
* Pick different secondary items – stack Dorans vs. Boots2 vs. Zeal vs. B.F. Sword in any combination you can realistically see yourself getting (e.g. try 2 Dorans+Boots2, but IE by itself is silly)

**Accuracy and Lane Control**

* By yourself – shoot for perfect CS for as long as possible. Count the number of missed CS over 15 minutes and try to bring that number down over time.
* By yourself – stay in lane as long as possible without letting the minions touch the tower. Try it while still shooting for perfect CS
* Get a friend to play against and have a CS-off. No harassing (except for collateral from skillshots and AOEs)
* 1v1 or 2v2 lane control – keep your CS up
* CS under tower – this is a tricky one, then CS as well as you can while the tower is shooting at the minions. See how many you can hit per wave and work on getting that up (remember, caster minions are one champ hit, one tower hit, last hit, while melee minions are two towers hits and a last hit).

**Scrims and Zoning**

* Play against a bot and practice holding good CS while harassing in between. See how much harder it is to concentrate when you’re poking? Add a second bot if you feel dicey (usually Sivir is a must for 1v1s
* 1v1 a bot without touching them. Try to avoid getting hit (since you can’t get hit back) – this is how you have to act against an aggressive lane or a lane that can outsustain you. Shoot for a new highest CS
* 1v1 a friend with your hidden goal being to keep their CS as low as possible. Harass a ton, and trying to get ahead on levels by zoning them out or forcing them to B. Note: this doesn’t work on bots – they’re too dumb.
* Go for a no-holds-barred 1v1 or 2v2 lane scrim against friends. Anything goes, same deal, just make it 3-4 kills.

Her kit is designed to succeed against melee bruisers: Blinding Assault's 1.5s blind lets her win short trades and avoid on-hit effects. Vault lets her maintain distance after your enemy uses his gap-closer. Vault has a very high priority so it will reliably be executed over things like Udyr's bear stance stun or Singed's fling. Heightened Senses is not a replacement for wards - its best use is against enemies who try to juke into the brush. Tag Team's immediate 80% haste with a nonexistent casting delay is a great panic button when the enemy jungler appears.

Her advantages don't work as well against mages

Post-6, this lets Quinn *blitz* down towers if the enemy ever leaves you in lane with a creep wave. It's a stronger buff than Sivir's ult, and lasts twice as long. (In bot lane, I prefer to max Vault first unless I'm losing hard

**Runes &amp; masteries:** I run AD reds, and scaling MR blues. You'll inevitably take a couple of hits, and lifesteal quints help you prevent that harass from adding up. Masteries are 21/9/0. In bot lane I prefer to run 21/2/7 masteries for the mana regen, but the extra health and armour is important in top lane in case your opponent forces an early all-in. Top lane is incredibly snowbally, so you don't want an early disadvantage to start building against you.

**Items:** My preferred build is standard ADC: Bloodthirster, and a Doran's Blade along the way. I experimented with a first item BOTRK, and with BOTRK/IE instead of BT/SS, but found BT provides much more offensive presence; BOTRK felt like I was nickel and diming opponents to death. Quinn already gains a lot of free AS from her kit, specifically via triggering Harrier marks, and that complements BT. You may feel otherwise.

For starting items, but it's risky with no wards or sustain; Blade is suited for an early all-in, but Quinn will probably lose a level 1-2 hard engage against a top lane bruiser/fighter.

4th/5th/6th item options include Frozen Mallet, GA.

1373889916.0,1ic25e,"New Aegis+Locket on PBE, and removal on Runic Bulwark?",pkblaze78,25,7,http://www.reddit.com/r/LeagueofLegendsMeta/comments/1ic25e/new_aegislocket_on_pbe_and_removal_on_runic/

http://www.surrenderat20.net/2013/07/714-pbe-update.html


Anyways

With the shift on PBE towards better selfish MR items, is the changes to Aegis and Locket.

The changes would make Aegis no longer give any aura armor, and 35 to 20 Mr. The icing on the cake is that Aegis also loses 50 HP. In reconciliation, they lower the price down to 2000.

Locket is getting reworked. For 600g+Aegis, and locket's shield active. (the active has the same values, I think.)

From the current locket to the new one, from 1850 to 2600. The item was bought on junglers due to being cheap and gold efficient. It gets more expensive and less gold efficient with the changes.

What I would like to see is for Runic to be removed, I favor more diversity in build path, so while I can agree with the somewhat OP bulwark being removed, I dislike Aegis and Locket being ""combined"" like that. I would prefer Aegis vs. Locket to be a decision point rather than a build progression.

**TL;DR** Runic may be taken out in favor of reworking Locket into an upgrade for Aegis. Aegis loses quite a few stats in exchange for being 150 gold cheaper.

His lane presence at level 1 is so strong thanks to Voidling harass

**Why max Q first over E?**
1) It's safer and more efficient damage than E. You do not require a target in order to cast Q

2) It's AoE. This means two things...the first being that you can potentially hit both opposing laners with it. That means more harass damage. The second being that it provides INSTANT pushing/waveclear versus the slower

3) Its CC duration scales up with ranks, but... it will still destroy a lot of currently popular picks like assassins that rely on resets in order to get out after diving into your back line.

**So then
Around the time you start maxing W

**What items?**
Well, more Wards, a few mana potions, some more wards)...typically AP support fare of Morellonomicon is great. You don't necessarily need a Philo. The Faerie you may elect to start with can go straight into the Morellonomicon.

**What runes?**
Quints, Double Pen, or Ability Power.
Marks
Seals
Glyphs

**Masteries?**
Two choices, but if the opposing AD is an Ezreal, Caitlyn, or Draven who will likely want to auto attack you in lane, go ahead and take the safe route.

**How do I win lane as this?**
Take Q level 1, cast it again. You can cast the third on your way to your level 1 destination if you're in a hurry, or stay in fountain to cast the third. Once the enemies approach the minion line at level 1 (if you do not engage somewhere in the jungle)...press Q at them, then start auto attacking. Your minion will just punch them for you, with power equal to your auto attacks. It's like DOUBLE THE AUTOS! Congratulations, your opponents are now stuck under their tower, likely at half health until your ADC decides to push there.

**What are weak match-ups for Malzahar support?**
Caitlyn ADC or Nunu support are some of the biggest thorns in his side. I haven't had to play against Blitz or Thresh with it

The biggest weakness Malzahar support has is the dreaded Evelynn Jungle pick. He has no ways to keep her from engaging on her ganks

Beyond that, knowing you have extremely high damage output. Either way, it's a risky play that can throw the lane or greatly mitigate your early power.

**How do you play team fights as Support Malzahar? Won't they just kill you when you ult?**
That's the beauty of it. You're just a support. You can sit back on your ADC, hopefully) and that assassin is going nowhere. And your ADC will be safe, and one of the two of you will likely get the kill. From there, you spam your Q and E whenever possible to try to assist/clean up any kills remaining.

**Do you seriously think this is viable?**
Absolutely. I would compare Malzahar support to Lulu (waveclear, AoE disable, excellent peel) or Fiddlesticks (lots of silenced targets, 3s single target disable) -- all of which have good residual AoE magic damage for team fights. I'd rate him slightly weaker than Lulu or Zyra for the majority of laning, with the exception being his level 1 being far greater than theirs. His objective control is the strongest of the four, however, and some properly timed invades can mean stealing away a jungle buff from your opponents.",False,,http://www.reddit.com/r/LeagueofLegendsMeta/comments/1h3av4/i_enjoy_support_malzahar/

Clearing: The clear times for me dropped thanks to increased movement speed and damage from his passive plus CDR

Ganking: The movement speed made it easier to get into lane plus a higher damage output

Teamfights: Hecari'm's teamfight potential is slightly nerfed due to the decreased tankiness and tenacity. I had to rely on items to absorb damage rather than his base stats, and being the tank he isn't focused too hard anyway. While he is slightly weaker in teamfights, your able to complete your build faster and help your teammates through better and more frequent ganks.

- Stronger and more frequent ganks
- Better sustain while jungling

- Slightly weaker late game

WHEN TO USE:
I like using 0/9/21 Hecarim when there already is a bit of hard cc in the team comp

Pros: 
* Strong ganks if you buy a shiv to push the lane

* Extremely safe lane with your stealth blink making you nearly ungankable

* great at taking enemy buffs and stealing their jungle

* can push like a demon to punish the enemy mid for leaving lane 

* gives great dragon and objective control throughout the game

* buying a cutlass into a BotRK gives you great kill potential with a q -e -active -ignite all in as the slow lets you get in those AA's while allowing you to throw the shiv for the dmg and sacrifice the permaslow

* ^^fun

* unconventional bonus: people not taking you seriously and not knowing how to deal with you

Cons:
* Squishy as all hell

* very high skillcap/learning curve

* Very little poke

* the shaco lategame problem:absolutely ABYSMAL if you're not snowballing

Those are the general things off the top of my head

I do the standard Maxing of E first, since the boxes are much harder to use in lane, unlike in jungle where they're a great tanking/clearing tool, since the Q crit allows for better burst if you're against a squishy midlaner.

I'd probably max boxes against a tankier opponent since they'd give you more objective control and pushing power which is what you'll be focusing on if you don't have kill potential.

As for items I'd like some input, against opponents I want to kill I go zerks, and against roaming lanes I go Mobility. The thing is I don't really know anything core after BotRK and SF. Shiv helps with pushing, but by your third item the magic damage bonus isn't gonna be much. I could get it first and get BotRK later, but I feel like BotRK gives so much more utility in helping you escape and chase if your deceive in on CD as WELL as the damage. Would Scimitar be good on him? I don't know. It's so expensive I've never bought it. Hydra is a great snowballing item because of the waveclear and Lifesteal it gives, but again it's so expensive I've never bought it.

Ragnarok+Shurelya Olaf heading straight for your Vayne?  Trundle just ult and Q while Vayne kites around your pillar until Olaf dies.  With less HP and armor

Trundles kit is very favorable during the laning phase; innate sustain, allowing you to remain safe from ganks and keeping you clear to farm.  Ultimately you will want to get 40% CDR so that you can spam all of your abilities in late game team fights.  Towards the end of the game you are simply a utility machine doing everything in your power to keep your AD alive and attacking.  **Frozen Heart or Iceborn Gauntlet**, depending on the situation, should always be purchased.  **Shurelya's Reverie, Locket or Zeke's Herald** are good aura items, since you will be hanging out next to your AD carry during fights, benefiting them benefits your team.  **Spirit Visage** is also a viable option if you need the MR, preventing them from ever reaching your AD.

I bought energy regeneration yellows as Ego Ignaxio suggests in his guide, and scaling health yellows are OK, but I wanted to try something new, so I tried scaling health regeneration yellows.

The stats on these are as follows: .11 health regeneration/5 per level; at level 18

Now, that's roughly 1 health per 5 seconds at level 1. Ass, I know. However, at level 5, that's 5 health per 5 seconds, or 1 health per second--about 60 health a minute. At level 10, that number jumps to 2 health every second

This, in addition to 9% spell vamp from quints and masteries, seems to make for an incredibly hard to push out of lane Kennen. Just for shits and giggles I've stayed in lane until level 11 and then gone back with 6,000 gold. Harder counters like LeBlanc (against whom I start NMM/2 pots of course) are still not an easy lane, but I can really feel the impact of having these runes, as her attempts at poking me down to 70% so she can instagib me become pretty hindered by my sustain.

Level 1 health regen with Doran's Shield with this setup = 2.3/second.

Level 2 = 2.6/second.

Level 3 = 2.9/second.

Level 4 = 3.3/second.

Here is my problem. I have recently been working on my top lane play. If I am last pick

Should I push my lane as hard as I can and get their tower ASAP

For instance, my bot lane was losing and they were whining for support. So I pushed my lane hard, got the first tower and started working on the second tower until I drew some team aggro (I had a few wards placed). Then we managed to secure dragon, and I helped get the other two first towers down. But while I was doing this, Akali counter pushed and got my tower and a decent amount of CS to get her back into the game. In retrospect, should I have done what I did?

First

* Passive: Gives 20% AS on minion kill
* Q: Hold to charge a big-ass arrow that passes through walls/units and deals a fuck-ton of damage. Proc's W

[10 / 43 / 77 / 110 / 143 (+1.0 AD)]-&gt;[15 / 65 / 115 / 165 / 215 (+1.6 AD)] (range+damage increase as you hold Q)

* W: Passively modifies your AA's to deal bonus magic damage and mark enemies up to 3 times.  Hit a marked enemy with one of your spells to consume them and deal %maxHP damage per mark.

On-hit Damage: 10 / 14 / 18 / 22 / 26 (+0.25 AP)

Blight Damage per Stack: 2 / 2.75 / 3.5 / 4.25 / 5% (+0.01% AP)

* E: AoE damage in a circle that slows and reduces healing. Proc's W 

Physical Damage: 65 / 105 / 145 / 185 / 225 (+0.6 *bonus* AD)

Slow Percentage: 25 / 30 / 35 / 40 / 45%

* R: Line skillshot snare

Magic Damage: 150 / 250 / 350 (+1.0 AP)


Now, we'll take a quick look at his base stats, which combined with his skillset should give us all the information we need to theorycraft into oblivion.

Varus Base Stats:

* Health	 400 (+82) 	        Attack damage	 46 (+3)
* Health regen.	 4.5 (+0.55)	Attack speed	 0.658 (+2.65%)
* Mana	 250 (+36)         	Armor	 13.5 (+3.4)
* Mana regen.	 6.5 (0.5)	        Magic res.	 30
* Range	 575	                        Mov. speed	 310

With everything here, what do you think?  I've been pondering the idea of using Varus to counter health-based Champs that lack gap-closers.  The incredible scaling on his W and his 575 range make me want to take him against Vlad or WW so bad.  Also, funny to note, is that the more direct counter to *both* Vlad and WW would be Varus' E, with the healing reduction.  However, I think that what would truly make him shine would be maxing W first and rushing a little AS, I'd love to see that burst.

[Abilities and Stats](http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/Vladimir)

* **Potential Roles**: AP Carry
* **Lanes:** Top
* **Common Item choices**: Hextech Revolved build into Will of the Anchients, Deathcap, Rylai's Crystal Scepter, Zhonya's Hourglass
* **Things to know**: Sustained magic damage, incredible lane sustain, weak early game
* **Beat him with**: Smart early harass, stacking MR.
* **Good counter choices**: Kennen

**Game Phases**

**Early game**: He uses abilities to farm - harass him when his ablities are down and deny him as much farm as possible.

**Mid Game**: Keep playing aggressive to delay his Revolver as much as possible.  Try to keep him shut down with harass and ganks to prevent him from becoming trouble.  His ult is brutal

**Late Game**: Bursting down Vlad is possible if he doesn't build any resistances. He'll have quite a bit of health if he got himself a Warmogs, or a well-placed silence.

**General Playstyle**

* Vlad will deal (ahem) tons of damage over the duration of a teamfight if not focused.  A Vladimir should be your team's first priority target if he's fed.  Vlad can't deal a lot of burst damage until he's maxed his Q and E (level 13 at the earliest) as they have long cooldows before Rank 4
* Vlad will normally not focus a lot on harrassing early game as he needs to rush his Will of the Anchients as quickly as possible
* Vlad will use his Ultimate in two situations: A teamfight where all his enemies are close together so he can hit his R on all at once, 150/135/120 seconds, so if he uses it in a small skirmish he won't be able to use it if a teamfight follows quickly after.
* Vlad doesn't have any real CC- his pool slows enemies by 40%
* If Vlad builds a Warmog's first for whatever reason,,False,,t5_2smhl,False,,True

The way I see it

1. Support lanes/ Gank.
2. Farm/steal enemy camps/ deny enemy jungle. 

Do you guys go into the game with the intention of supporting the lanes? Obviously, and calling for help, do you leave camps unfarmed to come and help that lane? 

I was under the impression, how much time do you spend helping? 

Also there is a large cost of attempting tons of ganks. It leaves the jungle open to be stolen

Also say you trade even


The other way I play is to focus of farming. Clear fast, as long as your team doesn't die a bunch. 


Last questions are about the blue buff. I usually feed the blue often and early. Even with manna jungles

Last questions has to do the enemy blue. A lot of mid players want you to ward the enemy blue and then contest it everytime it is up. I feel like its common to start a fight at the enemy blue and it ends poorly. Is this usually worth the risk of dying or the mid being selfish? If its open to be contested and stolen

He justified his decision by pointing out the 10% Ar Pen in the masteries and I quickly thought to myself

So I set out to 'mathcraft' at what values each kind of armor pen would be best in the duo bot lane and, a very tanky lane and thus the best scenario for percentage armor pen. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

So...

-Graves starts with 15 Armor (gaining 3.2/lvl)

- 9 armor seals add 13 Armor

- 3 points in defense add 6 Armor

- Soraka's level 1 heal adds 25 Armor

- Graves' passive, but this is theory crafting for the best case scenario) adds 10 Armor (20 at lvl 6, 30 at lvl 11)

That is potentially 69 armor at level one...

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

After 10 armor penetration from the ideal mix [though if you knew you were going up against this combo

After the 10% armor pen from the masteries

Using the application of armor formula: (100/100 +armor) X 100 = percentage of damage you take from physical sources) - (100/153) * 100 = You 65.4% of damage from physical sources. Wow.

With 25 Armor pen (all reds and quints) -

69 - 25 (Flat Armor Pen) = 44

44 X .9 (10% Armor Pen) = 39.6

(100/145.9)  * 100= You take 71.6% of damage from physical sources.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Now obviously

TL;DR - Might want to have a 'full' Armor Pen page handy for a Soraka/Graves lane in draft; get ready to cry if you see that lane in blind pick. 

Don't waste your time trying to fight them in lane when Graves has many stacks of his passive and/or when Soraka heals him; they'll win the trade.

This is what I was thinking: http://www.finalesfunkeln.com/s3/#73K7vwdPgvpl7A

Counter arguements: 

1. 9-0-21 is bad/not very strong. I really don't think 9-0-21 is bad, 21-0-9. AP mids really lack variety in the Offense tree, in my opinion, I mean it feels like its either spellsword and 3 into flat AP, or butcher is the only other option. I think 9-0-21 really opens up some variety in the mid lane.
2. Riot buffed base movement speeds, that I really kind of like is that it's much easier to dodge skillshots, which in the mid lane is critical (ex: lux, anivia, ahri, zyra). Also lets you move around in lane quick to get cs that you might normally miss. Movement speed also lets you roam alot, much more efficiently. 
3. Why 5 pots, on PURPOSE. If you have ever faced a Lee Sin,Katarina,Kennen,Zed,or Vlad mid, who started 9 hp pots and 2 wards(kat kennen vlad)/Red pot 4 hp pots and a ward (lee sin zed kha zix jarvan

Starting maybe doran's and 1 hp pot, then try taking tower as quickly as possible (thats the reason for the point in destruction).

Now, lower base damage) has opened up Sheen and Iceborn as excellent alternatives against AD assassin mids after Chalice.  Iceborn also makes Galio's auto-attacks worthwhile between his spells.

Especially when it comes to a choice between rushing that or RoA, where RoA does so much for Galio.  But now we have no MR, so the passive is getting wasted and we just have a mediocre caster with a good ult.  And with Iceborn Galio also has no health.  I just feel like it's making things pretty difficult since he needs a finished item so badly.

Galio's ultimate is countered by a lot of champions like Udyr, Xin, Blitz, Garen, many of which are still popular choices.  I'm finding it really difficult to keep up when playing as Galio between all of these issues.  Especially Kha'zix.  Fuck him.  I ult him when he has no tenacity and for some reason he can jump out of it before it's done.  -_-  Bad champion design on Riot's part for both champions.

1. Lane ganks are significantly stronger. The lane gank itself is often overlooked by many players in my experience. In my opinion, a lane gank with Ghost when the enemy is pushed to the tower is practically a guaranteed double kill given you are not counterganked. The risk of the lane gank is that you can get counter-ganked by opposing junglers waiting in the lane bushes to do their own gank.

2. Ghost has a lower cooldown than Flash.

3. Ghost allows you to stick to the enemy carries more easily in temfights. This does not apply to every champion

Cons:

1. Ghost can't get you out of certain sticky situations that Flash can. This also goes for chasing down the enemy.

2. Flash might be a better initiation tool in some cases. An initiation with Ghost is much more predictable and takes longer. 

Junglers who I think are better with Ghost: Hecarim, Nasus, Trundle, Dr. Mundo, Jax, Rengar, Shen

1354577681.0,1488vr,Interesting season 3 item interactions,Trevallion,19,0,13,"So I have been messing around with the season 3 items on the PBE in my spare time trying to find out how the new items affect certain champions. Here are a few cool things I have seen:

-Tiamat/Ravenous Hydra on Udyr: In turtle stance the damage from the splash counts toward the ""restores a % of your damage as mana."" The difference between his regular attacks and the splash from tiamat is pretty huge when clearing camps. You could probably grab this item and spam stances while never worrying about mana again. Of course it's arguable that you would want to get a pure damage item on him

Tiamat/Ravenous Hydra + new Avarice Blade (grants bonus gold on kills) on Gangplank: Much to my delight I discovered that Gangplank's Q and Avarice Blade grant bonus gold when you kill multiple minions with the splash damage from Tiamat. Supposedly it refunds half mana for every kill from the splash as well

Tiamat/Ravenous Hydra on Nasus: This falls into the ""bad"" category. Based on my Tiamat Gangplank experience, which further reinforced my suspicion. Unfortunately it does not. This actually seems like a terrible item to get on him since it destroys your ability to control how quickly the minions die, so I don't know why they put it in his recommended items. 

-Banner of Command (gives AP, nearby minions deal 15% bonus damage, promote active) on Elise: I was confused about seeing this in her recommended items, so I bought it out of curiousity and found out that the % minion damage bonus affects her spiderlings! Presumably it should affect anyone with a pet, so you could stack Yorick, Zyra, and Elise on the same team and only one of them would need to buy it to benefit from the aura.

-Captain boot enchantment (increases movement speed of nearby minions, which is great because Elise's spiderlings have a really low base movement speed. I could see it being pretty scary on Yorick too since his ghouls are already difficult to dodge.

Edit on this: after playing her a few more times I noticed her spiderlings have a really weird interaction with movement speed. They show a really low MS when sitting still

-Black Cleaver (shreds a % of armor on enemy champions when you deal physical damage) on Jarvan IV: Not only does this synergize with the % armor shred from his Q, because the splash from Tiamat/Hydra is physical, the Black Cleaver debuff is applied to everyone who gets hit by the splash damage. Get both of these items if you want to demolish the enemy team's armor!

 My last game on EZ I did fine in lane, despite my fizz being 7 kills up and taking out their carries. I decide to pick up LW to try and deal with him but I just can't out DPS him and obviously my whole team is spamming ping on their carries while I'm stuck trying to kite (VERY slowly) this olaf.  
  
So in the last team fight at around 30-35 minutes my items are - LW, Double Dorans and a Pickaxe. A total of 9,205 gold
  
His are Tabbi, Aegis and Maw. A total of 10,750 gold. So not a huge difference in gold.   
  
Am I itemizing wrong?   
 
Should I stick to Trinforce/BT even if they have an Olaf who is just diving onto me?  
  
Should I have picked up GA immediately after trin force?   
 
Do I sacrifice early game dominance and not pick up dorans blade?

I've been thinking about this for longest while

So I am here to discuss with you redditors of any potential new meta. 

I've seen the TSM and some other teams trying duo top and solo bot

What I have in mind are:

 Meta 1
 - Traditional solo top
 - Traditional solo mid
 - Solo bot adc 
 - Two junglers each covering one side of the jungle (red/blue)

 Explanation : Yes, there will be so much pressure added on top and mid. Seeing as the ad carry is usually the one who puts out the most damage late game, this can seem irrational, however, with an additional jungler replacing the support spot, it'll be a lot easier to stick to the enemy ad carry and nullify his presence during teamfights. Also, the potential of extreme couterjungling cannot be ignored. Imagine you're playing mid and there are shyvana and nautilus coming from each side of your lane.

The reason why I came up with this idea was that many new junglers don't even need the first blue buff (Shyvana, etc, although Lee is not comparatively new) So we let them take the red side of the jungle, and send our old junglers who need first blue (Amumu, Nunu, etc) to the blue side. 

The down parts of this meta is that it pretty much relies on early game dominance on top and mid lanes. If the team can't stop the farmed ad carry of the enemy team

 Summary:

Pros: - Lots of pressure on top and mid lane
- Strong objective controls (buffs
- Strong map control and possible counterjungling
- Will have another bruiser instead of a support
- Double Aegis madeeasy

Cons: - Miserable bot lane
- Junglers won't be fed enough if ganks/counterjungling aren't successful because they will be sharing the jungle resources
- Weaker late game teamfights if the enemy adc isn't shut down enough during teamfights. 

 Meta 2
 - Traditional bruiser top
 - Old AD carry mid
 - AP Carry or AP Bruiser bot
 - Traditional Jungler
 - A roamer that doesn't really need cs to pull off its effectiveness (i.e.  Alistar

 Explanation: There are many AP casters known for their superior waveclear abilities from a safe distance (i.e. Gragas, Anivia) The roamers will start off as supporters and stay bot until the AP caters are strong enough to clear waves without taking too much turret damage and harass. Afterwards, they will leave bot and start roaming to gank lanes. This way, we will still have the strong ad carry late game and still have the early game presence over the whole map.

Summay:

 Pros: - Bot lane won't be as destroyed as in the meta 1
- Can keep up in overall cs better compared to meta 1
- Strong presence all over the map
- Will not fall off late game
- Chance to instagib the enemy adc at level 6 and snowball after on.  
- Better CC overall (since the roamers would be naut/alistar/blitz

Cons: - If the enemy solomid is a big time nuker like LeBlanc or Annie
- Only certain champions can fill the solo bot role (Anivia, etc)
- If roaming fails
- Can be shut down by proper warding.
- If you're blue team

Basically what I came up with is using it to push very very quickly. Against mids that rely on roaming a lot

I could see it as a hard counter to anivia; it would push the lane to the tower incredibly fast forcing Anivia to waste a ton of mana just to kill creeps.

I think it would also work really well as a roaming champion against someone who has a hard time last hitting under turrets. Pushing to their turret will give you ample time to gank another lane

Possibly if you are running a backdoor Yi or shen, and generally a backdoor yi will be jungling so not sure how well that would work out.

* Tanky jungler - Nautilus, Mundo, Skarner, Trundle

* Aggressive support bot, Shen

* Melee AD carry bot

A sustain support like Sona or Soraka would probably be too passive to deal with harass, the melee AD would get zoned. In HoN/DotA, the support for a melee carry is typically very aggressive, able to constantly harass and nuke the opponent to give the carry room to breathe. CC to facilitate ganks and lane kills. I think Lux would be ideal for this but the others mentioned could work.

Bot lane can better protect dragon due to inherent tankiness in most bruisers.

Highly aggressive bot lane can catch ad carries by surprise and shut them down early

Does not hinder jungle ability and allows for more roaming from supports due to bruisers being (mostly) able to take care of themselves. 

Disadvantages: AD carries would be rather limited to those that either counter sustain or have very effective escapes (Trist

1326750781.0,ojum6,Proven tactics that fall outside the current metagame,capoeirista13,22,4,26,"I am going to say that the current metagame is strictly defined as

Top: Bruiser
Middle: Typically an AP champion
Jungle: Anyone who can clear the jungle with reasonable ease.  CC or gap-closers tend to be preferred for ganking.
Bottom: Typically a ranged AD champion and a support.  A support is any champion who can aid their lane partner without the help of too many items.


Now, I mean anything that falls outside of the aforementioned metagame and has worked consistently.  This could be an overarching team strategy (AoE, for example), an unusual counter-lane (Tryndamere mid vs Kassadin, for example), or even something like a unique item choice (Tiamat on Twitch, for example).

I thought it would be good for this subreddit to collect unconventional strategies that have consistently worked for us into one thread.

To start us off

Duo kill lane:  I've been playing a support kill-lane since DotA; a friend and I used to run Lina Inverse (a heavy nuker) and Crystal Maiden (CC-heavy support) and we only lost with it once to another duo lane that was absurdly beefy and had huge early-game damage mitigation and output (Axe and Death Knight).  Bringing this over to DotA our most successful kill lane is Leona/Wukong.  This has also been proven by Goose's success in running Leona/Jarvan.

Farming Jungle + Leblanc mid:  Leblanc does a poor job of farming minions, or farm and then miss gank opportunities.  The solution I came up with for this and my team implemented was to play a jungler who could effectively clear waves when we played a Leblanc mid.  This way when LB wanted to go gank, the jungler would go take his lane over so the exp/gold didn't get wasted.  You only implement this after Leblanc has already killed the champion in her lane, otherwise this strategy becomes redundant and LB just becomes a roamer without farm and your jungler just stays in lane actually causing you to lose exp/gold.

Background:

A long time ago, I have never played him. Today in ranked, I saw a guy (westbound43) playing Veigar in a featured ranked game. He's Plat 1. After watching that match, I decided to try out Veigar again, and it went very well (18/0 with him in Silver 1 ranked &amp; hadn't played him in almost a year). My second match went equally well (13/0). Both matches were against counters (Blue Ezreal mid = no AP, Ryze mid) so it's not like I was against an AP stacker. I've played him in quite a few normals since then to work on pure mechanics, and all have gone equally well.

Anyways, but his kit is considerably better. 

Pros:

- Infinite Q farming

- W buff a while back means you can land it with a level 1 stun

- Giant AoE long-lasting stun

- 1.2 AP ratio + high base damage on ult means that the 0.8 AP scaling off of the enemy AP isn't even necessary, but it's still going to be hitting pretty hard on everyone else.

- 100% ratio on W

- Passive + Flat Mana Regen Seals helps a lot with early mana issues

I'm not going to list cons since that's pretty much what I'm looking for.

This is my typical game:

Early - Focus on CSing

Level 6 - Harass with 2 or 3 Q's, Talon, and an Ahri with Negatron with no issues.

Mid-game - Begin roaming

Late-game - Just wander the map and catch people off guard. Progress to the point where I can one-hit anyone on the enemy team.

My build is:
Dorans+2 -&gt; Haunting Guise + Sorc Boots -&gt; Rabadon's -&gt; Void Staff -&gt; DFG.

I think the main difference here is my late DFG. In my experience

I also run Magic Pen Quints + Flat Mana Regen Seals

A big reason that people tend to give is that Veigar doesn't do anything except insta-gib one person. But in Solo Queue, with max CDR or even 33% (blue buff + DFG + masteries), Veigar's cooldowns are pretty low - easily on par with other mid laners. Having a 100% ratio AoE nuke on a 6 second cooldown (W) is pretty strong, and a giant AoE stun is easily a fight changer.

So far I've found that in order to be a good solo hard laner you need all of:
 
 - AoE wave clear
 - Sustain
 - Escape
 - Generally hard to kill

From that I've gotten this extremely incomplete tier list:

 - Tier 1 has everything -- Kayle

 - Tier 3 is missing two -- Varus, Lux, Syndra, Diana, Vladimir, AoE mages without an escape

 - Tier F simply doesn't have AoE clear -- Ezreal, LeBlanc, everyone else

I've found that everyone Tier 2 and down can still be screwed over by a 1v2 swap they weren't expecting if they go for any starting item that isn't loaded with sustain. Example: grabbing a Doran's Blade on Jayce will drop him to tier 3

Who else would it be good on ? Let's assume the max AP 600 ( to avoid problems and easier damage calculation ) and I assume you take the 5% on masteries so. 20% of AP + 15.


I want to test it on TF. 135 ish extra damage per hit. Works well with cards as well. It's no lichbane though. 

- Pick a card scales by 40% @600 ap its 240 damage. and Nashor is about half of that.

- 240 + 135 + 45 from gold = 420 + lich bane 600 = 1020

So far I am 9-1 after following spellsy's guide on lolking with a few minor adjustments based on my preferences. He describes fiddle as having a power curve in the lane which I very much noticed: 1-2 his silence is op dmg if u get it to chain off the ad+supp but 3-5 he is pretty weak in the lane just because you don't have many ranks in fear or your ult yet. But once he hits 6 his kill potential is unreal

I often hear hes a really niche pick but so far ive found only one matchup to be troublesome. That matchup being a decent caitlin just because its so difficult to get into fear range your only hope is to time when shes going in for a cs. But besides that aslong as you use your pink to control your brush in the troublesome 3-5 lvl zone all of the matchups have worked out quite nicely so far. You have to be very careful against taric/leonas because one slip and you very often are dead but the match up is manageable with proper brush control.

Later on in the teamfight phase I generally max my cdr and just peel with fear for my carry or go for one of their carrys if  I think I can do it safely. Also with proper ward coverage and twin shadows you can make so many plays for your team with your fear. What thoughts does reddit have on the support fiddlesticks?

As a side note I think of Elise as a mid lane or top lane champ only. I hate her in the jungle. idk about the new jungle now tho.

* Liandry's Torment: I see this as being absolutely core on her, a single human form Q will do ~230 + 23% of a persons HP (ignoring all other sources of ap.)
* Iceborn Gauntlet : I think One of the main problems with Elise top lane is that she has no sticking power after she gap closes with spider E.  This not only gives her a more offensive oriented armor option other than frozen heart (now that randuins doesn't build from heart of gold) but it gives her the ability to stick to people after she jumps on them. Might not be worth getting over rylais

* Banner of Command: possibly an early armor option that will also give her increased ap and pushing power. I read on this subreddit that The passive applies to her spiderlings. This will help out her split pushing and possibly maker her melt single targets late game

* DFG: on mid lane I think this will make her absolutely overpowered. use it as a replacement for Rabadons. A DFG-Q-W-R-Q combo will absolutely wipe the floor with any squishy on the other team. With the CDR returning

* Twin shadows: A cheap Ap and MR item. Building from a GP10 is a huge plus

* Spirit of the spectral wraith: I know I said I hate jungle Elise, so she will probably have a safe clear at lv 1, and this is probably the best option for her late game in the new jungle, unless you are building tank elise (lolwut).

* The black cleaver: Hear me out on this. Back when elise was first released I experimented with AD builds on her, which this item gives a bit of, and it gives cooldown reduction and HP, which are both amazing stats on her. This could possibly make AD Elise more viable. ( I think that it is already, but mostly in the jungle, as AP elise does the same thing, but better.)

* malady: Though it has pretty much the same synergy with her kit as before, probably best suited for top lane. With a maximum magic penetration runeset (22MPen) and sorc shoes, guise, and malady, she has the potential to ignore ~85 Mr and deal pretty good DPS with her attack speed roid.

1350317914.0,11im5c,Pawn stars cash money support.,Quasid,19,2,16,"Alright

Just for clarification

So what is the cash money support? You basically feel like [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0TIoL3yhw&amp;t=01m45s).

Alright. I'll stop joking around. 

The basic idea is to take the extra GP/10 masteries along with the extra 40g. You go gp/10 seals and quints. This gives you 7.3 gold per 10 right out of the gate. Then, you have enough money to go back and get a philo plus another ward. This equates to roughly a 4 minute philo. If you can convince your AD to let you take an extra CS or two, i've gotten mine as early as 3 minutes. 

a 3 minute GP/10 with a base of +7.3 GP/10. You'd be amazed at how much better you feel. You will never feel broke. The regrowth pendant makes not having armor from yellows for trades a null point. 14 hp/10 is stupid in lane. 

The reason i post this is that i think a lot of people go the faerie charm without realizing why they do. 4 wards is nice

A bonus to this strategy is what i like to call ""infinite oracles"". Essentially, if your team needs, you can constantly be buying oracles. Even if you die. I've had games where we were behind by 4 towers and 15 kills, i'll buy an oracles for map controll. Die after getting a somewhat good engage for our team (pick one off early, trade even 3 for 3 in the end). Buy another oracles. Take map control. Get a slightly better engage for the team. Sure, it won't work every game, but the ability to lose that oracles, and create good teamfights for your team is pretty good. 

A lot of people just go faerie charm without understanding that the BIG benifit to it is that you can place early wards on the map (wraits, ect). If you just take 4 wards and sit on your ass in lane, the regrowth pendant + 1 ward is incredibly powerful.

I played her a semi-tanky AP build - Cloth/5 into Merc treads, Deathcap, Zhonya's, Banshee's Veil. Went 9/21/0 and took Atk Spd reds, Armor yellows, AP/lvl blues, Ap quints. Probably not the most well optimized build but I was just trying some stuff out. If you dont go mpen reds, but atk speed seems to work too because it synergizes with her passive atk speed boost.

You could probably start Boots/3 on her considering how high her hp stays while jungling

She jungles fairly fast, might want to verify this). Her level 4 gank is okay, with a small displacement ability and a 35% slow for 2 sec. Her lvl 6 is very good, with an effective 9 sec cd on her ult (only using q) - you can possibly use it 3 times if you have a gank lasting longer than 9 seconds. It is very difficult to get away from her, even if you can get a stun or slow off.

Her scaling is quite good late game - Passive at 0.6 every 3 hits, and R at 0.6. All of her abilities except R are AoE and will just annihilate squishies. She mostly works as an assasin who jumps to the back line to kill carries, but with a bit of tankiness can also initiate or at least disrupt with R-E. Her E is super strong in teamfights - it works like an Orianna R + W with a 55% slow and no dmg.

With a bit of cdr your Q cd is ~5 seconds so you can use her ult around 4 times in a mediumish-length teamfight (counting one non-moonlight use at the end). Unless you can kill the Diana coming at your carries

It makes me angry when someone does this and I feel it's detrimental to the team.

Here are my reasons:

* **750 team gold**  Early gold is much better than late gold and I rather that our team have it now

* **Free Roaming** Now that my lane is won I'm looking to pressure other lanes and take down their tower.  I can use this extra time to 2v1 in another lane.  Also

* **Bulk Farming** Now that I took down the enemy tower

* **Opponents lose zone of control** If a turret goes down

* **Wards** Now you can get wards deeper into the enemy territory with less risk.  

* **Closer to Winning** It's necessary to kill towers to win.  It just brings you that much closer to hitting an inhibitor.

The only argument I see against doing this behavior is that it ruins the 'farm' of a lane.  The enemy can now farm at his second turret and freeze the lane.  However if your opponent is doing this

1340675513.0,vlts4,Fizz - Rushing Lich Bane vs rushing Deathcap - a small analysis,gandodepth,19,1,15,"Well

If you've got the standard AP quintessences on, by the time you're level 11 (I think that's a reasonable time to have a Lich Bane), you'd have 75 AP before that Lich Bane. Lich Bane gives you 80 AP, so that's a total of 155 AP.

A standard harass combo is WQ and then E-E away.

According to [this League of Legends Wiki article](http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/Fizz_the_Tidal_Trickster)

The passive ability of Lich Bane is as follows: 

&gt;Unique: On cast

This is basically an addition of 1.0 to the total AP ratio of this combo

With the same item build (triple Doran's and the same masteries/runes) and a Deathcap

There are upsides and downsides to both builds.

**Upsides to Lich Bane rush**

* Additional damage is physical

* If you properly utilize your skills in such a way that you use the Lich Bane proc on all four of your skills

* Smaller component items

* Magic Resistance and Movement Speed bonuses from Lich Bane (the Movement Speed bonus is probably a very large reason why many people rush it

**Advantages of a Rabadon's Deathcap rush**

* More damage if you're going for a quick R-W-EE on top of the enemy - autoattack-Q-autoattack burst attack and don't have the time to wait for Lich Bane cooldown

In conclusion, but the additional movement speed and MR from Lich Bane will almost always allow you to win trades if you're able to get it early enough to still be in lane, and the movement speed will allow you to gank other lanes faster and outrun chasing enemies if your Playful / Trickster isn't quite enough.

A friend who is new to the game recently asked me for advice on boots. He's convinced that Boots of Swiftness (Enhanced Movement +3) are necessary for his carries because they let him chase

I tried to tell him that Boots 1 give +50 MS, but he thinks that 20 MS difference is very important.

I tried to tell him that you can combine Boots 2 with three MS quints for basically the same movement speed as Boots 3 (only 3 MS less actually) and still come out ahead stat-wise, or 25% armor and 35% tenacity (Mercs). He also reasons that Boots 3 + three MS quints make you even faster and will probably go that route (+108 vs. +87 MS)!

I tried to tell him that if he improves his map awareness, but he says the crutch makes him stronger, so why not use it?

I then said that all that MS is useless if you get jumped on by champions with gap-closers, but still seems pretty adamant about Boots of Swiftness.

2. At a lower ELO his ultimate is incredibly difficult to use correctly but high level supports know when to use it. A revive can really change a game

3. His harass is also very good at lower levels

I believe that pre-nerf Morgana could hold her own due to shield/spellvamp though I'm not sure how well that will work now. Most of my other casters have serious problems once level 6 hits (or before) - Karthus

So what I propose is countering these specific champs by swapping your AP carry and your AD carry. Caitlyn in particular can decimate Kassadin mid lane though I don't know if she can do the same to LB/Akali. For the APs part they will level slower but since they usually do better burst damage than the ranged AD that should provide for interesting opportunities in the bottom lane (assuming your support is a taric/alistar/janna not a Soraka).

* TheOddOne finds him intriguing enough that he plans on investigating Cho's viability in jungle
* Cho is a beastly laner.

Ergo

Problems:

* Stonewall's jungle typically involves leveling e first and I find this to be effective in jungle. However it's not making good use of any AP that you would buy (spikes do have a .3 AP ration but I don't find it worthwhile to rush radabons with just that and level 1 scream/rupture).

* Ganks are troublesome unless your lane has decent CC as you need to land rupture. My best solution so far is to run in with red to apply the slow
* Items like razor/lantern don't make a ton of sense on him.

Strengths

* Can counter jungle well due to high HP and ability to take camps fast.
* Can take just about any route through the jungle and be ok
* Can build AP or AS/onhit and be useful to the team
* Great utility with Silence + knock up.


Considering that his rupture and scream are useful just as utililities you can probably build him as an AS/Atmas and be ok
I'm considering:

* Cloth Armor + 5 code red
* Wit's End
* Atmas Impaler
* Mallet or Chain or Negatron
boots in there somewhere and potentially you could rush a lantern as the razor procs are great and the free wards are amazing.

Alternatively if your team needs some AP

* cloth + 5
* boots
* Needlessly Large Rod
* Chain and / or Negatron as needed
* NLR &gt; Radabons.
this is cheaper and more adaptable but I don't know if it will seriously slow down the jungling until you can afford NLR.


Some parting questions:

* How is my theory crafting? I know people that play the on-hit / AS builds with him but none of them are over 1300 elo
* What are your favorite cho routes in jungle? I like to steal wraiths and then run all my minor camps before buying boots
* Any tips on ganking? I really like to play junglers who have the option of a level 2 gank.
* Is there anyway to have a good jungle while starting regrowth pendant in order to build p. stone for the G/10?
* What runes do you use, scaling MR/lvl blues.

My reasoning behind this is that in a reasonably high skill level game

What does this have to do with flat magic pen runes? Well as the 40% penetration from void staff is applied after magic pen and any magic resist reduction, banshees and MR/lvl scaling blues, they will have 129 magic resist at level 18 (30+25+50+24 = 129).

This means that if you have 9 magic penetration from runes

So looking at our target with 129 magic resist, i didn't plan that lol) then the 49% reduces it to 51 magic resist. Pretty good right?

Well if we look at this without the magic pen boots and runes

For example with the 29 flat penetration we reduced the enemy magic resist to 51

65.8 - 51 = 14.8  -  This shows how much flat penetration you actually get from the runes and boots in the end.

29 - 14.8 = 14.2  -  This is how much magic penetration is **wasted** by the percentage penetration.

29*0.51 = 14.8  -  This shows how flat magic pen is reduced by percentage penetration.

So what would i take instead? I have recently been using armour penetration marks instead of magic penetration. This makes last hitting creeps become easier as their armour increases throughout the game, as well as a nice bit of early game magic resist to counter any enemy magic penetration.

In my opinion, utility or other offensive runes such as armour pen for marks, gives very little to no early game disadvantage, but a considerable mid/late game advantage.

Just yesterday another one was published on cloth5.com (http://cloth5.com/foxdrops-solo-queue-jungle-tier-list-patch-3-10/). I like the list and the rundown of champions but I have to question the actual order of champions.  

A good example in this list would be Amumu. He is listed in tier 2 and while this isn't bad it is not tier1. Yet Amumu has one of the highest solo queue winrates (53%) in all elos including diamond. Usually people argue that Amumu isn't perfect due to his susceptibility to early invades and so does the author of this tier list. But Amumu obviously must have other advantages or else he wouldn't have this amazing winrate.

On the other hand we have champions like Elise (46%) and Nocturne (47%) both listed in tier1. The author describes how Nocturne clears so amazingly fast

So what do you think? How many conclusions can we draw from champion winrates?

Here's the gist of it:
* Masteries: 21/0/9
* Runes: Gp/10 + 5.25

* Items: Philosopher's stone -&gt; kage's lucky pick -&gt; chalice of harmony -&gt; boots (If I don't have gold to complete chalice or kages

* Level Order: Q -&gt; E -&gt; Q -&gt; W. Maxing Q first and then E.
* Summoners: Flash Ignite.

Here are my reasons for trying this build out

* I realized early on when experimenting with syndra
* I realized that syndra's E works as a great disengage for losing fights. Especially if you know how to position yourself to get more than one enemy lined up for a stun. I started maxing E second for the lower CD on an important stun.
* By relying on her E
* I found that building syndra conventionally (rushing rabadons/dfg/zonyas/void staff) caused her to fall off fairly hard even if she was bullying in lane. Typically she could nuke the adc or apc
* The +800 health from rylais+liandrys helps her survive if initiated upon. Once it's lategame and we're teamfighting, or attempting to catch a squishier champ with the stun. In most cases the health is enough of a defense to not get burst down in an engage.

Here's some issues that I'm aware of
* I can't pressure well. It's fairly obvious and to be expected, or be able to take/stop dragon very well.
* Syndra does not have good mobility
* This causes a lot of tension with teammates that are traditional. Nobody wants to see their 2/0 mid buy philo and kages instead of something snowbally. And I don't have near enough time to try and defend my build in game

Granted

**The goods:**

1. This is a push lane, with free autos, Q, and W. You don't have to worry about missing farm and keeps constant pressure on their bot lane. 

2. This also brings up jungle presence. You need to be aware of it at all times, this also prevents their jungler from ganking other lanes, freeing up your other lanes from pressure as well as giving your jungler more breathing room for ganks.

3. Cooldown is absolutely fabulous on Sivir. You're going to be at 39% after you finish the 3 core items (Boots, effectively giving you a 5.49 (Q), 1.83 (W), 6.1 (E), 48.8 (R). What I want to press here is the CDR on the Q and W, you honestly don't need any extra attack speed if you can land the Q, and the burst is much higher with that then any autoattacks (negating crits). The 6.1 seconds on spell shield is amazing as well for defensive purposes. 

4. You can't run away from Sivir

**The bads:**

1. So the problem with this is, limiting on how this strategy might work during the laning phase.

2. Also, and other times, nothing. I'm also unsure if Q and W proc the Muramana, but I do not believe it to be so.

3. Builds are also situational

4. No kill potential, if you can't complete most of the build based on farm, then you're not playing effectively with this composition.

#

In conclusion, and not to mention throws the enemy team off. You need to have synergy with your support to pull this off well, but the laning phase is absolutely gorgeous if you can pull it off correctly, and while this is different from a kill lane Sivir, you give opportunities for your other lanes to carry via Jungle pressure or from your ultimate.

Stats from Items:

* Mana: 1000 (Muramana) + 500 (Iceborn Gauntlet) + 400  (Frozen Heart) + 300 (Banshee’s Veil)  = **2200 Mana**
* Armor: 70 (Iceborn Gauntlet) + 95 (Frozen Heart) = **165 Armor** + 25 (Ninja Tabi)
* Magic Resist: 45 (Banshee’s Veil) = **45** + 25(Mercury Treads)
* Damage: 20( Base Muramana) + 44( Muramana Passive) + 40 (Last Whisper) = **104** + ~181.8 (Muramana Toggle from Total Max Stats Mana)

Total Max Stats (Calculated without Runes/Masteries):

* Mana: 235 (Base) + 595 (35 Per Level) + 2200 (Items) = **3030**

**Other Key Notes**

While some stats seem low, someone is going to have a Runic Bulwark, and you probably have flat Magic Resist Runes, so you will be over 100 MR.

You have all the abilities that come with those items. With Frozen Heart and Iceborn

**Build Order**

Faerie +Consumables  -&gt; Tear -&gt; Boots -&gt; ??  

Start: Faerie Charm(180) + 1 Ward (75) + 3 Health Pots (105) + 3 Mana Pots (105) + 5 Gold Remaining

Tear obviously needs to come out ASAP to get it stacking to sustain your ghoul powers. 

My lane successfulness was very limited with rushing the Manamune. The stacking of and reaching more mana came faster

I have not had a chance to try out going Glacial Shroud or Catalyst as first item after Tear.

* Manamune costs 1400 (400 Long Sword + 1000 Combine)

* Glacial Shroud costs 1350.(400 Sapphire + 720 Chain Vest + 230 Combine).

* Catalyst of the Protector costs 1200 (400 Sapphire + 475 Ruby + 320 Combine) 

**TL;DR**: Yorrick building all mana-items with Muramana core-item as a tanky bruiser.

Discuss:

**Do you think Glacial Shroud should be purchased before Manamune?**

**Which Glacial Shroud Item should be purchased first Iceborn Gauntlet or Frozen Heart?**

**Catalyst coming out sooner like Ryze/Karthus/Singed to get that Regen bonus with each level?**

**Which Ghoul to level first? Omen of Pestilence is great harass and wave clear

My first point of contention is whether to max W or E after Q. Many of the guides I've consulted suggest maxing E second. My logic is that E is mostly used for mobility

Second, grabbing the CDR reduction in the offense tree and the extra HP in the defense tree. This should allow me to maximize bullying in lane with more frequent harass while providing a good amount of HP. Thoughts?

Finally, initiate with E, then press R, follow up with W, E again. At that point my ultimate should have given me enough rage to cast a rage-enhanced Q. With this sequencing, I should be able to maximize damage output as it allows me to cast 3 rage-induced spells while initiating with E for the armour penetration. Is that the optimal combo that Renekton can possibly pull off?

Passive and Stats

* Health regen base and per level reduced.
* Base AD reduced but AD per level increased.
* Perseverance takes longer to activate

Decisive Strike

* Now always a 35% movespeed boost on an 8 second cooldown
* Movespeed duration and silence duration now scales up with rank.
* Removes all slows on Garen.
* Base damage increased at higher ranks.

Courage

* Passively increases armor and mr by 20% rather than 0-25 based on cs
* Damage reduction 30% at all ranks instead of 20-36%
* Now gives 30% CC reduction
* Duration scales with rank
* Cooldown adjusted to 24-20 seconds from 30-18 seconds.

Judgement

* Now scales with Base AD instead of Bonus AD
* AD ratio changes with ranks 0.7-1.1 of total instead of 1.4 of bonus
* Deals 75% damage to minions (up from 50%)
* No longer removes slow on activation or reduce incoming slows
* Garen ignores unit collision

Demacian Justice

* Cooldown adjusted to 160/120/80 from 140/120/100

My thoughts

* Perseverance is great for freezing a lane and seems much more reliable when not hiding in a bush.
* Decisive Strike removing slows seems so much more natural.  Very effective vs champions like Dr. Mundo
* Decisive Strike has always been a devastatingly long silence.  Really good vs a lot of mages in teamfights (or ezreal if you can catch him)
* Courage is even more a 1 point wonder and scales really well into late game.  Merc treads
* Judgement now clears minions really well
* Demacian Justice is so satisfying to use.  It isn't Noxian Guillotine

I think that glass canon garen is dead but now super tanky garen is in his place.  He scales extremely well with defensive items.  His itemization is much better now and with the addition of maw of malmortius his has some safer offensive options.

I really like picking Garen vs heavy magic damage teams because it is pretty easy for him to get up to 300+ mr.  He still suffers from being a melee without a reliable gap closer and doesn't have any ability to farm from range and is much less of a lane bully from before.  He is not a true tank (no peel) but he can become very disruptive and tanky in team fights.  Even without damage items his damage output is really high and one full combo should level most squishies.

I run 9/21/0 going for ad and armor pen in offense, mr/lvl blue, and armor pen quints.

useful site to reference the skill set: http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/index.php?search=katarina&amp;fulltext=Search

* Always get q first. Farming tool. simple.

* Now

* Now if it's a pusher (morg

* If it's a range with decent or high pushing capabilities (tf

* q can be used as ranged harass. It does not have to hit the champion directly as it can be used to bounce off creeps. This is why it's important to know that the bounce ranges from 2 at first leveling and 6 at max leveling. This is because you want to raise the chances of the blade bouncing to the opponent thus using it on a minion with a champion near it at a certain time when there are not that many minions alive will increase the chances (up to 100%) of the blade bouncing to the champion. Also it's important to know the bounce radius. Not the ability radius. It is shorter from my experience (around 300-400 range). Basically

* w at lvl 4. This is a must/situational. Must when you max q since you want to use it as a harassing tool for full damage and extra damage on your q. extra damage works on all abilites too including e. 50%hp reduction is good too (this does not scale so this is why it's ok to max w last but still have a strong skill set). Also it's a good damage reduction skill which is why it's so strong against mid.

* e. not much to say about this skill. Combined with flash it is an awesome get away tool or a kill securing tool. Always remember to be nearby a ward

* ward. always grab 1 or 2 (or 3 or 4 or 5) wards after you back the first time. I tend to not ward any areas because I think it's pointless unless you're going for a kill in lane and more often than not

* Ult. Can be interrupted midway so positioning is important! What I'm saying is play like a scared 5 year old girl. Go into team fights late. Allow the enemy to use their cc and then go in during maximum chaos to be able to use your ult to its fullest extent. You also cannot be seen when you ult in a bush. It is also a good method of detecting stealth or nearby enemy (if they're in a bush). However keep in mind the range is really small. Saw a play by scarra where he was in the blue enemy wolf jungle where he ulted along the left wall as the enemy were chasing one of his team mates through the lane on the other side of the wall. The enemy just melted like butter. Pretty sight. To this day, you dont need vision. As long as your ult sign pops up, its good and ready to go. 

* Passive cd reset! This is what makes katarina, you can ult several times (i ulted 4 times once within a minute or two while team fighting and chasing down ppl). Also, this makes her a very ""divey"" champ. Dont be scared to be aggressive and dive with her (flash if you have to) as long as there are minions nearby or you have a ward. you can kill, instantly get reset on your e and then shunpo to nearest enemy or allied minion or place a ward and shunpo to it. You wont get hit by the tower more than 2 or 3 times so make an educated guess on how much hp you have and GO FOR IT!

* Ganking. VERY ESSENTIAL IN PLAYING KATARINA. You will tend to snowball after first blood. So helping other lanes snowball is essential in winning as you will not be able to carry late game effectively. One method of ganking I found out was that your lane ganking is VERY STRONG. if the minions in bottom or top lane are held in mid way

* Now finally the good part. Itemization. What people dont realize is that katarina's early burst is insane. So what I do usually with katarina is grab one or two doran's blade. Why doran's blade? Well your q and your ult scale off ad pretty well and it also gives you hp! So it's an excellent item. Plus it gives you sustain (lifesteal) albeit small but it still helps. Also they allow you to last hit better with auto attacks under turret. I feel that going right into hextech revolver makes katarina squishy but going dorans will give you both damage and some tankiness.Another item I found really effective is haunting guise. This item is crazy on her. Not only does it give her ability power and health, you will be dealing true damage to your opponents and since you're an assassin, you generally aim for ad carries and ap carries who have absolutely no magic resistance. I will still sell huanting guise towards mid-late game with another item that gives more ability power as I do prefer burst and instagibbing squishies. What I consider must have items: doran's blade (sell later), haunting guise (sell later, but usually game is over b4 you get full items), gunblade, sorc shoes zhonyas hourglass, abyssal scepter (against high magic damage team), void staff (against heavy mr team). 

Hope you guys enjoyed it and found my tips and tricks to be somewhat innovative and a learning experience. Thanks for reading! no tl;dr :p

We tried quite a few things so far, which threw them off balance. 

Short summary to this metagame:

* With two people in the mid lane you got a pretty nice jungle control
* The 2nd mid laner can easily run off to one of the sidelanes
* Dragon control is pretty much similar to the current EU Meta

1376421454.0,1kapk8,Jarvan Support?,wabi44,24,8,12,"So I've been trying out J4 as a support champ in Soloq bronze/silver. My main support used to be Leona since I typically like disruptive

There were two problems I had with Leona:
1) Mobility -- you can quickly initiate on the enemy

2) Carrying -- if one of your teammates afks for a while, and her natural dmg is pretty low since she can't proc her own passive.

Jarvan seems to do much of what Leona can do

He has: 

* Great CC (knockup
* Gap closers
* A passive that is great for trading/harrassing in lane
* Strong burst dmg combo even without any items
* An amazing skill in the form of his E. Jarvan's flag gives him an armor passive which is great in bot lane
* Fast farming (midgame) if you need to step up and carry. This extra gold allows him to be more useful late game since I can usually farm out at least one mid tier ad item or just extra tanky items. 

To me

My typical support build:

* Start: Rejuv bead, 2x health potions
Philo Stone (if losing)

* Sightstone

* Emblem of valor (if losing

* Mobi upgrade

* After that, or warden mail depending on matchup

* And 1 mid tier offensive item: Wit's end (against AP), or brutalizer

If the game goes even longer, or randuins. And then finish Bork or BC, or if I got wit's end, i'll build something else, like a phage. Normally I won't get the chance to finish the higher tier items since I'm buying wards and oracles in the meantime.

* Soraka - lowest pick rate out of any of the traditional supports not named Karma. I feel like it has to do with her extremely high mana costs on leveled heals
* Alistar - also &lt;10%
* Nautilus - he feels like he fits somewhere between Leona and Blitzcrank, giving him a free extra 28 damage if he procs it on both enemies in an engage)
* Fiddlesticks - I guess his passive is wasted which is a fairly big deal, &amp; Kog are the heavy magic damage ADCs, none of whom are very popular atm)
* Zyra - Personally my favorite support. I understand she offers no sustain
* Morgana - rarely seen at any point as a support, Sona, &amp; Janna and her snare is more devastating than any of the aforementioned's CC as a basic skill. I would assume it has something to do with the fact that her ult practically requires Zhonya's to be effective? Imo she feels like a more defensive version of Zyra
* Elise - I don't own her nor have I ever played her, giving her poke, CC, and burst. 
* Lux, Cho, and Zil also come to mind, but I'm very unfamiliar with most of them as supports.
* Kill lane supports? Lee Sin and Jarvan IV both possess kits capable of simply destroying the enemy bot lane with their mobility and burst
* Has anyone ever considered Cait support? I know that's probably a really weird thing to suggest, maybe running ArP so that her harass that much stronger? I understand she would have little to offer later in the game though, but she still offers pretty much the best early tower and lane pressure in the game.

Some obvious tips that I can think of:  
  
* If you're losing lane, and *don't die.*  It took me a while to get used to, but staying in lane and giving up some last hits, while still staying in EXP range is a lot more beneficial than getting those few CS but giving away a kill.  
* Know when a tower is lost.  If you see an unmanned tower being pushed
* If your tower is down, but if you're letting the enemy roam, you're likely enabling deaths by not also doing the same.  Clear enemy creep waves when possible, but don't stay in lane too long. You're both hurting your team, as well as putting yourself in a dangerous position.  You can come back and take their tower later when you have backup.

In terms of numbers, but at level 18, the bonus would be raised to 27.54 AP. If one were to mix these glyphs in say, a 5:4 ratio of scaling:flat AP glyphs, the early game bonus would be almost half that of the bonus from flat glyphs, but still almost five times the initial gain from scaling glyphs, equaling out to 5.61 AP.

alot of her Top power is the ability to harass with q

Without that ability and running oom quickly it might be a problem.

I'm thinking between tear rush (7 abilities stack that quickly)

But I can't decide what's optimal on her
I never rush roa on her
 because if you want to give it time to stack 
you need to rush it (singed style)
but the diff is that singed is a late beast 
and elise is mid game beast
 to really have an impact you need sorc shoes and hunting guise + an AP item (rylis/abyssal).
If you'll be rushing roa you might get stuck with not enough dmg.

Tear on the other hand will give you mana quickly (all no mana spider skills stack it quickly)

I don't like fh on elise

Chalice seems interesting choice though it costs more then a tear

-------------------------
The question is, and yeah, Amumu is around once in a while as well. The question is, how does the community feel about some of the other junglers I use? Is there competitive potential in a few I am considering? I'd like some honest opinions before I time dump into figuring out how to properly play them. 

I'm looking to expand my jungler list of champions that can do the following:

- Be Tanky
- Initiate
- Gank well from the start
- Make a heavy impact throughout the game
- Can build to be a heavy damage component if necessary


So far my list of junglers that can meet the criteria are:

- Jungle Tank Darius (surprisingly effective
- Malphite (obvious)
- Amumu (obvious)
- Nocturne (initiate while tanky)
- Nunu (counter jungling 101)
- Dr. Mundo (I think he might be better top but he can push people around in the jungle)
- Jax (has to build more tankier than just 'lol shoot my gun with a rageblade on my back gg)
- Skarner (Starts off slow
- Fiddlesticks (I feel like his initiate ability makes up for his lack of being tanky whatsoever)
- Lee Sin (As a jungler, Assassin, Tanky Initiate, almost invaluable.)
- Olaf (I feel like he can do a lot, are generally very surprised what he can do when he pops his ult and runs into an adc and presses e on them, past level 7.)
- Mao'kai (Initiate, especially with proper sapling use)

My community tends to play very light assassin like play, so I'm looking for feedback. Of course there's other jungles that are just plain good, names that come to mine are:

- Eve (I would rather just see her mid for her lane presence instead of wasting her in a jungle right now.)
- Kha'zix (See above)
- Zed (Better off top lane)

But these are jungles that tend to be very squishy

- Alistar (his jungle is just too slow)
- Master Yi (Just a clean up dunkmaster
- Diana (Wildly overnerfed in the previous patch.)
- Sejuani (I just feel like she's just way too slow
- Fiora (There's just better choices for being a lightweight ult abuser)
- Gangplank (The presence in ganks just hasn't been the same since his passive got nerfed
- Kayle (Kind of a support-ish Jungle. I really want her to work again
- Pantheon (It feels like if he doesn't garner 3 kills in under 10 minutes he's just always playing catch up, 'assassin,' but when he can't get to that point he is rather useless.)
- Renekton (He was fun in season 2 but he's just kind of irrelevant right now unless fed quickly
- Tryndamere (He was good for low elo stomping, these days people have figured out how ignite works, and you almost want to take cleanse, but you change your mind for flash, and it all goes to hell.)
- Rammus (Just seems gimmicky

Champions I am considering learning to add to my list of reliable jungles:

- Cho'gath (He is seeing heavy play in Season 3 Qualifiers right now
- Volibear (Just seems.. so tanky. I worry about his clear time.)
- Hecarim (Is fast into lanes pre 6
- Jarvan 4 (Being played in S3 Qualifiers as I type this to combo with MF. If you have an MF I feel like he should be considered just for how he can warp a team fight while MF is wildly firing bullets everywhere)
- Nautilus (That ultimate is an initiate on its own if used properly)
- Shyvana (Fast with a w
- Udyr (I hear things that he is getting some love soon
- Warwick (I get it, is an argument you see used often.
- Vi (Will this upcoming patch fix her?)
- Xin Zhao (He is squishy at times


So, why? Who does their job better? What's some of your experience in Solo q and ranked team play? If you want to know why or how something I think is viable, let's talk about it. (***ASK ME ABOUT JUNGLE DARIUS, IT'S SO GOOD BUT SOUNDS SILLY ON PAPER***.) As you can see, I play a shitton of junglers all over the place. I love the list, but I can't play everyone, I have to retract some to expand.

I'm about a 1500 player, sitting in normals. My few ranked games have been jungling for me, and working out well so far. (My summoner name is Joeey, you can see what I've been doing on my profile.)

I would like to talk about Vi in the jungle.

I have been experimenting with her and found that she fills a really nice niche in the current meta which is blowing up enemy carries. I believe that

Personally, Ragnarok-ing beast. If able to get the perfect combination of Q-&gt;AA-&gt;E-&gt;R on an enemy carry then denting blows applies to the carry and her ultimate will deal 450 (+140% additional bonus AD) damage respectively with 20% penetrated AD damage. When synergized with' Black Cleaver' we're talking about some serious damage to carries who stack little more than 80-100 armor endgame.

I like to build Vi in the jungle coring 'Spirit of the Ancient Golem' seeing as she needs to be front-line bruising throughout the entire game as a jungler. SotAG also increases the size of Vi's passive shield by 50 which is a nice little buff for the early game (essentially mitigating an auto attack). With early game health and armor dealt with Vi requires attack speed, it provides a lot of magic resistance for what you pay for and helps her utilise 'Denting Blows' faster on carries.

From here you can decide whether you want to invest in straight up AD. I find myself usually taking black cleaver after 'Wit's End' because of just how much a step-up of damage it provides. This is also true of Brutalizer

Starting in the jungle I like to start with W on the wolf camp and then taking blue using a single health potion. Upon leveling to level 2 I usually decide to level up Q because of the damage and utility it provides in either the jungle or to close the gap for a level 2 gank. I have been considering doing this with Red Golem for her chasing problem but have yet to actually test it.

My runepage consists of Flat AD reds

My Mastery page is 15 - 15 - 0 focusing on reaching Brute force in offence and Block/Juggernaut in the defensive page. I take Smite and Exhaust because her dueling and team fight potential requires both a gap closer and chance to actually take some hits from the opponent.

TL;DR: Vi has a lot of damage if purpose built. She can trade herself really well for a high priority carry without needing to worry about closing the gap. She lacks very early game and late-game team fight potential and requires very specific itemization. She's also fucking cool.

1355533676.0,14vfjp,Weak Early Junglers: How to Handle Early Lane Pressure?,tobascodagama,20,4,29,"So

However, people around my level (Normals only; I'm level 25) are preferring to run duo top and not jungle. And inevitably whoever went top on our side doesn't know how to 2v1. (Which I won't nail them too hard for, because it's legitimately difficult for most match-ups.) Here lies the problem: I want to gank top to take off some of the pressure, but Naut basically sucks until his first big item.

If I wait until level 4 and my first item to gank top, he just gets bullied out of lane again while I'm doing my next clear.

On the other hand, because Naut fucking *melts* without items.

Seems like a catch-22. I don't want to just say, but it seems like the only realistic option. As far as I can tell, early ganks on Naut are a really poor gamble, barring a really skilled top laner. (More than you can count on getting while solo queued.) Whereas, if I stay in the jungle and farm or gank lanes that aren't losing, I stand a chance of being relevant mid-to-late game and maybe turning things around when we start teamfighting.

As you can tell I have a few questions concerning nidalee top who I am looking to pick up.  Top is by far my worst lane and so I wanted to learn a couple champs just in case I need to play top and over the past couple days I've had a ton of fun with Nidalee.  So if you could please help with some of these questions that'd be awesome!

* Are there certain champs where it is better to go AP Nidalee
* What item progression works the best? (I've been building the following 2 scenarios for early game)

1) If laning is going well I usually start with a triforce (phage &gt; sheen &gt; zeal) possibly a couple dorans if i need to back early.

2) If laning isnt going so well I will pick up a wriggles before the triforce for some sustain. (From what I've read triforce is a must have [usually early])

* What items are best suited for her after triforce (granted every game is different
