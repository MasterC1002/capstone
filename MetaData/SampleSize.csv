I write surveys for a living and I find that I'm always learning better ways to write my surveys.  It's a skill that definitely takes time to fully develop.  Here are some thoughts that this community might find helpful:  

- Sample: the sample here is not nationally representative.  Since most of the tools don't allow for qualifying the sample

- Questionnaire design: do write questionnaires like a story

- Question design: don't write unanswerable questions.  For example

- Question design: don't write double barreled questions: ""To what extent do you agree or disagree with the following statement: Access to abortion and birth control are a fundamental human right.""  I may have different opinions on both and not be able to answer the question.  

- Question design: don't write leading questions: ""Don't you agree that the evil Syrian government is committing flagrant human rights violations by murdering its own people?""

The most prominent result here is that every group mostly plays as their own gender.  This effect is strongest with transwomen (90% choosing female) and weakest with bisexual men (52% choosing male game characters).  What's also interesting is that every female group has a stronger preference than it's equivalent male group (e.g. of straight women 77.3% chose mostly female

9-11 record (45% success rate)

21 and under:

18-39 record (31.5% success rate)

And I do recognize that this is a flawed way of interpreting because older age means there’s a more chances to add one success story.

##Sorry

* “Most awkward 3 years ever.”
* “The crush I didn't act on would have broken a family apart
* “**Guhbluh**. Just that what normally stops me from acting is ""oh
* “She was dating one of my friends, especially if they are happy.”

And sometimes

* “We were never in the same place romantically for the same time.  He loved me; I wasn't ready.  I loved him; he'd moved on.  Back and forth for years.  I was married to someone else for almost two years before I realized I was finally over him

##And the successful side##

* “Told my middle school crush after six months; we've now been together for 5 years and are engaged!” (So frickin’ baller. –JM)
* ""One has resulted in the most fruitful relationship of my life.""
* ""For the girl in question, the third, with her getting into a relationship to spite me, and now the fourth. About three years all up, and we've both had relationships in between. But we did both have mutual feelings. Every time.""

###Demographics.

Of the 386 respondants

*  35 Bisexual/pansexual cisgender women.

*  99 Straight cisgender women.

*  9 lesbian cis women.

*  7 transgender (female-to-male) men of varying sexual preferences (mostly preferring men)

*  17 other-gendered female people of varying sexual preferences (mostly pan/bisexual).

*  4 transgender (male-to-female) women of varying sexual preferences (mostly pan/bisexual).

*  13 Bisexual/pansexual cisgender men

*  13 Homosexual cisgender men

*  163 straight cisgender men

*  2 male people with a third gender or prefer not to share their gender identity

*  3 Cisgender men with ""Other"" sexuality

*  21 Cisgender women with ""Other"" sexuality


Among the 31 people who input ""Other"" as their sexual orientation:

*  7 were asexual

*  6 entered sexualities that were covered under the other options

*  3 had complicated preferences or were unsure.

*  1 person specifically liked to date trans people.

*  One person was attracted to animals.


###General Results

(Note that the sample size for the results section will be different from the demographics section

Among the general population

1.  Straight male

2.  Straight female

3.  Pan/Bisexual female 

4.  Pan/Bisexual male

5.  Lesbian

6.  Homosexual male

[This chart shows the break-down of how people answered.](http://i.imgur.com/qZuK1VW.png)  Options which are more highly-populated towards the left of the chart are more highly preferred.  

Some interesting things to note are:

* Heterosexual male was far-and-away the number one choice.  Not a single person picked it as their last choice.

*  Homosexual male was far-and-away the least preferred.  More than half of the respondants ranked it last.

*  The top two choices were to be straight

*  If people are going to be straight, they would prefer to be female.  


### Bi/pansexual women

This, anyone with gender identity ""female"" and sexual preference ""I don't have a strong preference"")  [Here is the chart](http://i.imgur.com/OQwLdFE.png).  The order of preference is:

1.  Bi/pansexual female 
2.  Straight female
3.   Bisexual male/lesbian female (tied)
5.   Straight male
6.   Homosexual male

Some interesting things to note:

*  **Very high** customer satisfaction with this product.  Over 70% of bi/pan women chose to remain just that

###Straight women

[Graph](http://i.imgur.com/xn1IW2b.png)

Order of preference:

1. Straight female 
2. Straight male
3. Bi/pansexual female
4. Lesbian or Bi/pansexual male (tie)
5. Homosexual male

###Bi/pansexual men

[Graph](http://i.imgur.com/DUG1UlF.png)

Order of preference:

1.  Straight male
2.  Bi/pansexual male 
3.  Bi/pansexual female
4.  Homosexual male
5.  Straight female
6.  Lesbian

### Gay men

[Graph](http://i.imgur.com/GRIwUJD.png)

1. Straight male
2.  Bi/pansexual male
3.  Gay male
4.  Straight female
5.  Bisexual female
6.  Lesbian

Interesting to note that gay men have the *lowest* customer satisfaction, which is ranked higher than gay.

###Straight men

[Graph](http://i.imgur.com/BUg5FJk.png)

1. Straight male 
2. Bisexual Female
3. Straigiht female
4. Bisexual male
5. Lesbian
6. Homosexual male

###Third gender people

(Of all sexual orientations)

[Graph](http://i.imgur.com/qQuzpm7.png)

1.  Bisexual male
2.  Homosexual male
3.  Straight male
4.  Bisexual female
5.  Lesbian female
6.  Straight female

Very interesting results here.  While Straight Male is the top choice and Homosexual Male the bottom choice in the general set


###Transmen

(Of all sexual orientations)

[Graph](http://i.imgur.com/SJ0X1Ln.png)

1. Bisexual male
2. Homosexual male
3. Straight male
4. Bisexual female
5. straight female 
6. Lesbian

Much like homosexual male, they have a rigid rank order of preferences: they would prefer to be bisexual more than they would prefer to be attracted to men, which they would prefer more than being attracted to women.

[Here's a graph](http://i.imgur.com/TOaAS5K.png) showing what people *thought* the average Redditor would rate cats and dogs.  A few people thought that Reddit would rank dogs as 1 (hated) or 2.  And significantly more people thought that cats would be rated as 5 than dogs.  Overall

[This last graph](http://i.imgur.com/0WMt2uY.png) is a little confusing, or liked them both the same.  The inner circle shows how many people thought Reddit would like cats more than dogs, like dogs more than cats, or like them both the same.  As you can see, very few people thought Reddit would like dogs more than cats, the plurality instead believing that Reddit would like them both the same.  Interestingly, slightly more people chose that they like cats more than dogs than the opposite (by a difference of 2).  This goes against the mean differences in chart 1 above

the kind of things i'd like to see addressed are:

1. questions being optional
2. when to use input fields vs check boxes
3. simplifying questions and making surveys shorter
4. using non-leading
5. providing an accurate participation time (5 minute survey

there's probably other stuff that i've overlooked.

perhaps we could also:

1. remind people not to post surveys at the last second (zomg this is due today plz help!)
2. encourage people to discuss their research in their post (to help with receiving better feedback)

those are just some ideas. i hope that we can maybe improve the quality of people's surveys and (ultimately) the quality of their results.

Alright

Let's move on to the actual data. First

[Chart 1](http://i.imgur.com/GxYz5Iq.png)

[Chart 2](http://i.imgur.com/Qfhpb1p.png)

Not surprising, and also skews the data, so from this point forward, let's disregard those two numbers.

In the beginning

* They would be odd.
* They would be prime.
* They would be surrounding the 1st and 3rd quartile (around the numbers 25 and 75)

I also made hypotheses on the ""least random"" numbers:

* They would have many prime factors.
* They would include multiples of 5.
* They would surround the upper and lower bounds.

In first place, it's even, which doesn't follow 2 out of the 3 hypotheses. Here's my explanation for this number: it is a multiple of 3, it hovers around the third quartile, and it includes the number 7. That last part is probably the most prevalent; numbers with the digit made up a significant chunk of all numbers chosen, almost 40%. In fact, you have to go down the list to 12th place to find a number without one (way to go number 22!).

[Chart 3](http://i.imgur.com/eRrxfwP.png)

From the data

[Chart 4](http://i.imgur.com/NqkqkLZ.png)

A measly 31%. There are 25 prime numbers between 1 and 100, and it's appearance in the primes, the small jump can be attributed to the magical number.

Next up to test was the quartile theory. Here it is.

[Chart 5](http://i.imgur.com/wp2d7Fv.png)

The verdict: no correlation. Each group has 17 numbers, but it includes all of the 70s. The inclusion of the number 7 was likely the main causation for any increase in score. 

To conclude the ""most random"" numbers

Now let's look at the ""least random."" Multiples of 5 all got a couple votes here and there. Expected. Here's some things that were unexpected:

* Numbers with the digit 1 in the one's place received few votes
* Squared numbers received few votes
* Multiples of 11 received a large amount of votes

I would love to keep on analyzing this data, but I need to move on. I do need your help for one more thing though. At the beginning I asked you to read this and to fill out a follow up survey. Here it is:

**Using the knowledge you, make an educated attempt (as a society) to be truly random. That is, attempt to create a relatively even distribution.**

I’m currently working on a research project about Reddit, what you like/dislike about it, how you view others on the site, etc.

A couple of notes (IRB/legal stuff):

* This is a research study being conducted by the Department of Communication at the University of Illinois at Chicago.
* You are eligible to participate if you are over the age of 18 and have a Reddit account.
* Eligible participants will be interviewed using Reddit’s direct messaging feature.
* Interviews should take about an hour (total) of your time and will be relatively informal. I have some topics I’d like to cover
* Your identity will remain anonymous. You will have the opportunity to provide me with a pseudonym in place of your Reddit username that I will use for any public dissemination of material.
* Participation in this study is entirely voluntary. You may choose to end your participation at any time or refuse to answer any questions I ask.
* This research has been approved by my university’s Institutional Review Board under the title “Understanding Participatory Culture and Engagement on Reddit.com

While there is no direct benefit for participating, whether you choose to participate or not.

Please feel free to contact me with any questions you may have via my Reddit account (/u/nrrdgrrl4500). And

Thank you in advance!

**Some findings**

Disclaimer

The results were pretty interesting

**Do you enjoy shopping for clothes?** **Do you enjoy choosing what to wear every day?**

Women who responded enjoy shopping for clothes more than men do (average of 3.4 versus 2.6 on a scale from 1 to 5).

41% of people who responded prefer shopping for clothes than choosing and outfit, but only 27% of men.

*Do you enjoy shopping for clothes?* (On a scale from 1 (hate it) to 5 (love it))

* Average: 3 (stdev: 1.2)
* Men: 2.6 (stdev: 1.2)
* Women: 3.4 (stdev 1.1)

Several people mentioned in the additional comments that they hate shopping because the sizes are non standard

*Do you enjoy choosing what to wear every day?* (On a scale from 1 (hate it) to 5 (love it))

* Average: 2.8 (stdev 1.0)
* Men: 2.7 (stdev: 1.0)
* Women: 2.9 (stdev 1.0)

**How much time do you spend choosing what to wear on a normal day?**

Overall

This value goes up to 97% that spend less than 10 minutes for men

Among women

**What are your main concerns when choosing what to wear?**

The responses here were pretty diverse.

Top 3 concerns were: 

1. Wearing clothes that you like (83%)
2. Wearing comfortable clothes (80%)
3. Wearing clothes that match the weather (62%)

Bottom 3 concerns:

1. Appearing younger than you are (1%)
2. Following the latest trend (3%)
3. Appearing older than you are (5%)

I was surprised that ""Following the latest trend"" got so few votes. If you believe the media (but maybe I should stop doing that)

**How many days to you wear...**

*Shirt, but another third (32%) wear them two days, and 14% for for 3-4 days.

*Sweater, a week (25%), a couple of weeks (29%) and a month or more (20%).

*Jeans

*Underwear* There's a clear consensus on wearing them 1 day (86%). An additional 9% think 2 days is ok. That leaves 5% that wear them for longer than that.

In the additional comments

* materials 
* what you were doing the day you were wearing them 
* if you've worn them the whole day or part of the day
* if they smell


**Do you think it's acceptable to wear the same outfit two days in a row? (not including underwear)**

The opinion is extremely divided. 52% of respondents think it's acceptable (yes: 14% of total, no: 7% of total).

Men who responded were more in favor (60% yes or mostly yes) than women were (45% yes or mostly yes).

Overall

**Additional comments**

To conclude

 *""If I could afford to hire a personal stylist to shop for my clothes and pick my outfit each morning

*""I envy the times when you went to a tailor to get a few outfits and wear those all the time and it was completely acceptable. Fuck fast fashion.""*

##”Why would you want to live in these worlds? And why would you not want to live there?”##

One of the common reasons for wanting to avoid these places is the danger inherent with having a world exciting enough to write an adventurous story about them. But on the other hand

One person gave this interesting answer: 

“I chose the ones that I was familiar with, I already know how to kill mutants, or in Star Wars I would already understand the basic concepts of how things worked. I would not want to be somewhere that I didn't understand.”

##Concluding comments##

When I thought up this survey, but without as strong of a vote of confidence as I would have imagined. The one exception was Harry Potter, which, besides unfamiliarity answers, over half of you agreed on.

First, except I didn’t want to spend a lot of time getting the data ready to be analyzed correctly in Rstudio, and Excel allows the data to be a less standard (Not really, it’s just easier to get around!). All tests are given to the .05 significance level. Of the ~1000 entries, I got rid of the big outliers at the top end of the frequency spectrum (I found that the top 2% had a nice round cut off of 14 times per week, so that’s the point I used). I assumed normality, so used parametric tests (Which is true for the means due to the central limit theorem, because you have to understand that the only people who answered are the type of people who are on reddit. So

**Questions**

Does sex drive go down with age? **No. In fact

Is there a relationship between age and kinkiness? **No. Kinkiness has a near-uniform distribution over all responses.**

Does shacking up result in less sex drive? **No. While the sample means showed a relatively large gap (5.539 ideal sex per week for living together

Do males want more sex than females? **No. The mean for male ideal sex frequency per week was 5.817

Is there a linear relationship between self-image and self-confidence? **Yes. A Pearson’s coefficient of 0.667 indicates a moderately strong positive linear relationship between the two values.**

Does your self-image wane with age? **There is not enough statistical data to indicate this. I do not think there is no negative linear relationship between the two,000 that focused on this I could definitely find that relationship, but with this sort of sample, there is not enough data to support this hypothesis.**

Do you want more sex when you’re single than when you’re not? **Surprisingly, and 6.086 for people who aren’t single.** 

What about virgins? **Once again

Now

1. The number of homosexuals was surprisingly low. Only 30 in the 1000 responses, and I would think Reddit, being so socially liberal on average, would have more than that. 

2. Not as surprising, 19, 20, and 21 each. 

3. The youngest responders were 14

4. Of the six possible choices for relationship status

5. The youngest age at which people lost their virginities was 12, but maybe for these boys (the three of them are all male), sword fighting was one of their favorite things to do as a child for a reason!

6. The oldest virgin we had was a 32 year old asexual. The oldest non-asexual virgin we had was a 29 year old male who

If you're going to look through the data, which is the main thing I was analyzing.

The actual project I did was a shorter powerpoint, there is some information that you'll probably find irrelevant.  

The two main things that are important for understanding the data are:

1. p-values.  I explain this on the first page, as they can refer to almost any kind of test, but in the case of this analysis, this definition is correct.  5%/0.05 is the usual cutoff value.

2. Bookmarks are very useful for navigating through data quickly.  All of the **univariate** stuff looks at the distribution of each individual variable.  **ANOVA** measures a continuous variable (e.g. Age) against a class variable (e.g. whether you like classical music or not).  **Freq**uency tables are basically what they sound like.  For tables with 2 variables

A few significant results:

1. Among those who practice music

2. There is no apparent trend in maximum years spent playing an instrument and how much one practices per week.

3. People who listen to internet radio on average spend at least 2.5 hours more per week listening to music than those who don't.

4. There isn't enough data to tell whether or not there are any differences between favorite genre and how much music someone listens to per week.  The boxplots appear different

5. There is no apparent relationship with how much music people listen to per week and age.

6. There is no strong relationship between how much people practice per week and how much music they listen to.  There is a wide distribution for the 31+ hour practicing group

7. Women play woodwind instruments more.  Men play brass instruments more.  Big surprise.

8. This data set showed an opposite of the expected trend with age and favorite genre being classical.  Older age groups were less likely to list it as their favorite and younger age groups were more likely.  This is largely due to the fact that I used /r/classicalmusic as my main data source.

Just a note:  39 data points were removed because they were improperly filled out (for those who answered multiple genres for favorite genre

Unfortunately, she doesn't know enough people over 18 (which for some reason, the survey filler-outers are supposed to be?) to get the required base sample size of over 25 results. And being the Abu Dhabi, she can't exactly go door knocking.

I told her I 'knew some people' and thought reddit might come to the rescue here. The survey is very clearly made by a child, I know it would both help her out immensely AND make her day (and mine too - I barely get to see her as i live in australia, so helping her out with her homework I've never got to do before).

- Participants were very good at assessing the gender of each sample. Of all answers
- Participants were less accurate in assessing the ages of the sample speakers. Only 46.6% were accurate
- The results from this survey support past research into peoples' general ability to determine age and gender based on voice alone.

The research should help us understand reddit a bit better. It's looking at aggressive behaviour, and secrecy in relation to the anonymity reddit can provide.

* ""WTA stands for ""wait time average""

* All of the graphs contain the same data

* In total

* A few people in the comments of the original post noted that assumptions had to be made in the conditions of the relationship and/or breakup. This is a good point, and that's reflected in the results!

Here's a few things that I thought were interesting about the results themselves:

* The wait times as a function of the relationship times fit a power law pretty well

* The wait time decreased fairly regularly as age increased

* Six people responded saying that no wait time was necessary for any relationship length

As you can see left-handed respondents are over-represented (the normal split would be around 10:90)

**[Here's the graph version for the activities](http://i.imgur.com/CZcasDl.png)** and **[sports](http://i.imgur.com/vMCQCKp.png)** (I left out the not applicable respondents for clarity)

The highlight of this survey in my opinion is **the staggering domination of the right hand mouse**. **85% of lefties switch hand to use a computer mouse.** 

Unfortunately I wasn't able to perform advanced crosstab analysis as I intended before releasing the survey

---

[**Operating System**](http://i.imgur.com/Dg6EdJO.png)

There has been several articles saying that lefties are more likely to be Mac owners

The results are **somewhat supportive** of that theory

---

[**Fapping techniques**](http://i.imgur.com/xysg90i.png)

Another popular belief around lefties is their supposed advantage when it comes to online fapping sessions: as shown above a staggering amount of lefties use a mouse with their right hand

The survey shows that 52% of the respondents can fap with a different hand than their writing hand

[**Optical dominance**](http://i.imgur.com/ORepLU6.png)

Wiki states that the distribution of optical dominance is 66:33 in favor of the right eye

Here those proportions are respected with a 64:36 split but **the left eye dominant folks are majoritarily left handed (56:44)

Until now we know very little about the development of different sexual interests. To learn more, we want to improve our scientific knowledge about human sexuality and compare different kinds of sexual preferences.

We are looking for male and female participants who are sexually attracted to men, and (quite intimate) sexual fantasies and behaviors.

Filling in the questionnaire will take 25 minutes at maximum. The whole data collection and analysis is completely anonymous. Beside this questionnaire, IPs, email-addresses etc.) will be collected or stored. We have neither the means nor the intention to trace the participants of our study. Therefore it will not be possible to identify individual data sets or to give feedback on personal results, even on request of participants.

Our research interest is strictly scientific and aims exclusively at knowing more about the origins of different sexual interests in general

For those who have replied and haven't got a response yet, and those of you who have submitted applications but for whatever reason aren't yet a mod will be the first to be considered.** Mainly I'd like people who value the scientific process (as unscientific as these methods sometimes can be) and appreciate the ideas behind this subreddit in general. If you'd like to be a mod, just send me a message that generally explains (1) why you'd like the position, (2) what you could bring to the subreddit, (3) what kind of surveys you think would work here (or wouldn't), and for curiosity's sake, what position you hold in a scientific community

Also I'm thinking about suggesting that surveyors let people know in their post title what kind of survey they are asking them to participate in, [SM] (Survey Monkey), etc. I actually [created a survey](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/viewform?formkey=dDlGcEN1Z2Z0NXpEalNnOWJyU1lxYWc6MQ) to see what people thought about this.

I can see the flow of this subreddit sort of looking like this: 

(1) Surveyor posts their survey (scientific or otherwise) on [/r/SampleSize](/r/SampleSize) and adds any additional comments in a self post if they feel they are necessary.

(2) Anyone willing/able to participate does so.

(3) If they are comfortable with doing so

If any kind soul knows their way around photoshop and would be willing to create a [/r/SampleSize](/r/SampleSize) logo

Also, surveys can really be about anything, science or otherwise. Excellent sites to create free surveys would be [Google Docs](docs.google.com) (under ""Form"") and [Survey Monkey](http://surveymonkey.com/). You can use a google account to create surveys on both sites.

The truth is that the US does not have an official state religion.  The US Constitution prohibits a national state religion.  The states that make up the US were allowed to have official state religions but the last one was abolished in 1833.  In 1947 judges ruled that a 1868 amendment to the Constitution prohibits state religions at all levels of government.

Most Americans are completely ignorant of the concept of a state religion.  They do not realize that countries such as Sweden have an official religion.   (I am not implying that Sweden is in any way a theocracy).

Being an American, so instead I made a poll with a bunch of plausible answers, along with the correct answer: other/none of the above.  I also added ""I don't know"" so that people who are ignorant - and know it - would have an answer that they could be proud of.

Question 1: How do Americans sign up for their official state church?

    Other/None of the above: 29 (43%)

    I don't know: 34 (50%)

    All other answers: 5 (6%)

    Other/None of the Above: 28 (41%)

**Edit2 (Results):**

As promised

Also, be sure to think of each graph in terms of ""out of those who responded to this question, these are the percentages for each response."" (My apologies if this sounds patronizing. That is not my intention)


**Demographic information:**

Here are the [graphs](http://imgur.com/Vb0umYY).

**The predominant demographics of those surveyed were:**
-middle class
-heterosexual
-female
-ages 19 - 25

(Note that the bottom graphs represent only a small number of people)


**Judgment information:**

Here are the [graphs](http://imgur.com/8mIROTl) for these

**Here are the statistics regarding judgments:**

Judged age: mean of 21.6875 years, and third at 19 (13.58%)
Actual age: 20

Judged sex: 98.81% male
Actual Sex: male

Judged economic class: 85.71% middle class
Actual economic class: lower class

Judged belief system: 46.99% atheist
Actual belief system: non-traditional

Judged nationality/racial background: 37.23% European descent of some kind
Actual nationality/racial background: European ancestry (including German and Irish that I know of), American

Judgments made on appearance or health: 47.37% tired or sleep deprived in some way
Comments regarding those judgments: I certainly am sleep-deprived

Judgments on personality traits: 11.43% each for laid-back and ""outdoorsy.""
Comments regarding those judgments: both are accurate judgments.

Judgments on musical taste: Indie, at 50%, 25%, and 25% respectively.
Comments regarding those judgments: in most cases


**Conclusion:**
For the most part, at the large percentage of people who believed me to be part of the middle class (I actually only live off of $12,000 a year). I was also expecting a larger amount of inaccuracy in the final portion, but people generally identified my characteristics pretty well. Overall, I found this rather insightful and interesting.

Us mods here would like to officially announce that we intend to take part in the **Best of 2012 Awards** here on reddit! As I understand it, but this year, they have decided that the site has just gotten too large for that. This year, subreddits choose to do awards. 

Subreddits that have over 500 subscribers [hey, we would still like to honour the members of our community for outstanding contributions.

We will be running a series of mod posts over the holidays and we suspect this will run over into the new year

- Category Nominations
- Category Vote
- User Nominations[/Category Announcement]
- User Vote
- Winners Announcement

Links for all of these will be posted in the sidebar as they appear. [Side note: Do any of our helpful/savvy users know how to make a sticky appear at the top of the page? We can't seem to figure it out!]

**Some general notes and rules** that will become more relevant later: We the mods reserve the 'right' to veto anything we dislike. We are fair and unbiased [moreso than FoxNews!], and while those who already have reddit gold can be nominated, and win, the next highest placed user that does not have reddit gold will receive the creddit. Both users will be mentioned in the Winner Announcement thread though! Us mods cannot nominate any of the mods [but you can!], and a user cannot nominate themselves either.

[Letter ""o"" and Circle Direction](http://i.imgur.com/ZCAo2zt.png)

Alright, because the way it was coded ended up being a bit confusing.

What this graph is trying to show is the people who drew their circles clockwise/counterclockwise and how they wrote the letter ""o"". 

* Shades of red represent people who wrote their ""o"" counter clockwise. The 50.5% on the bottom drew their circle counter-clockwise AND wrote ""o"" counterclockwise. The 23.7% on the upper left are people who drew circles clockwise but SWITCHED to counter-clockwise ""o""s.

* Shades of blue and ""kind-of-blue-maybe"" represent people who wrote the letter o clockwise. The larger chunk of 21.7% in the upper right are people who originally drew their circle clockwise and then wrote ""o"" clockwise as well. The sliver of 4% represents people who switched from a counterclockwise circle to a clockwise ""o"".

---

From the statistics, particularly because MORE left handed people drew the circle counterclockwise, at least in this survey.

I found the number of people who switched from a clockwise circle to a counterclockwise ""o"" to be interesting though.  Notice that it doesn't happen all that much in the opposite direction.  People either stick to clockwise or go with counter clockwise

1373166457.0,1hs88i,Participants needed for a Real Scientific Study using Portal 2. [PC Version- Details Within],rebootedrock,18,1,13,"[Also posted to /r/Gaming at http://redd.it/1hs6f2]
Hello and welcome to the testing environment. You may not be there now
This thread is a request for online testing candidates to participate in a Real Life Scientific Study that uses Portal 2. 
If that isn't enough to win you over

* Who are you?

I am a masters student in Psychology at the University of Tennessee at Chattanooga and I am looking for help with my thesis in the form of playtesters.

* Playtest?

It's probably better to get into the meat of it right now
My master's thesis focused on cognitive ability (IQ) and performance within a simulated environment context. More simply stated

I am using the game Portal 2 as the tool for my study, and 15 test levels, all of which are custom Portal 2 maps. The initial 7 levels are embedded with audio narration that teach players how to play the game step by step. These are followed by 4 easy puzzles with no narration before beginning the remaining levels which increase in difficulty.

What I need help with is making sure that these game levels progress smoothly in difficulty
If you help me out for 1.5 hours

* Who can participate?

For this internet norming process

* What do I need?

You will require your own copy of Portal 2. You must understand the English language

* You said 100$

For Reddit members only, paypal, etc.).
Members of the SomethingAwful forums have a separate reward incentive from Reddit (I am going to advertise there too)

* How long will this take from my busy social life?

I am asking only for an hour and 30 minutes of playtesting time

* I like money/science how do I participate?

1. First off make sure your copy of Portal 2 is installed and running smoothly, and I do not take responsibility if this melts your dual quantum overclocked e-machine.

2. Once you have made sure Portal 2 works
 
3. Next

You will need to extract the portal2 and sdk_content folders into your ""Program Files/Steam/steamapps/common/Portal 2"" folder.
If you are at the right folder

*See the below Technical Note if you intend to play the Portal 2 Story Mode!*

After extracting the files here is the process to follow:

Setting up Portal 2

1. Launch steam and goto your games library. Right-click on Portal 2 and select Properties
2. Click the Set Launch Options Button
3. Type exactly: -console
4. Click okay
5. Once you are at the title screen Press the ~ key to bring up the console (if it is not already open)
6. Type this into the console: snd_rebuildaudiocache
7. Portal will sit there and look like its loading a map for a while
8. Then type exactly: exit

Beginning the session

1. Open Portal 2 again when you are ready to play for 1 1/2 hours.
2. In the console type: record_research_data 1
3. Press enter
4. Play through the game until either 1 1/2 hours have passed

Sending the Data

1. Open your ""Program Files/Steam/steamapps/common/Portal 2/portal2"" folder.
2. You should find near the bottom a file named ""portal2_research_data""
3. Open it if you wish to see your performance (please don't change anything in here)
4. ??? Profit and make yourself a drink

* Technical Note

You will need to overwrite your portal directory in your steam folder with a set of custom files that I have created for the study. As long as these files are present

Note: This is not a mod because when I began the project I knew nothing about making anything

* Sentimentals

Thank you for reading this and (if you did) participating in my project. This project means a lot to me and it means quite a lot to have your willing participation. I have no financial support (aside from a university grant that barely pays for the instruments I need)
I have many people to thank for their help

Want to send me a message? I will check this thread but I prefer email: csbuford@gmail.com
