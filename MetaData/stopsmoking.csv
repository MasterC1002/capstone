There are a million reasons to quit, or on your breaks at work, or whenever it is that you used to smoke.  Sure, it feels harder for a few days, maybe a few weeks, but you'll soon realize that you're not missing out on anything.  You can still hang out with the smokers, you can stand outside and breathe fresh air, and on your terms.  

You can allow yourself angry or nervous or stressed, not because you ""need"" a smoke.  Stop using cigarettes as an excuse to acknowledge that you have feelings, or as a tool to do normal, healthy things like being able to step away from a stressful situation for a moment.  Smoking doesn't actually help you deal with anything.  Taking time for yourself does.

For about 5 years (from 17 - 22 years old) I smoked heavily

I really enjoyed it too. I've never been the most balanced person


On top of that, talk, and share something with other people. I met some of my best friends through smoking.

I tried quitting many times. I knew smoking was terrible for me, I was more concerned with the temporal state of myself, the one that just needed to smoke another cigarette to feel OK - I wasn't worried about future me. I knew that I should quit smoking, but deep down I was selfish and short-minded.

I tried a lot of things to help me quit - cold turkey, hypnosis, Allen Carr's book. I tried and failed many times before I finally got it.

This is the advice I have for smokers who actually want to quit: 

**1. Understand why you want to quit.** You already need to quit, it won't happen. ""We're all going to die someday, why not enjoy smoking, am I right?"" It's very hard to argue with that logic, especially during withdrawal. I learned that instead I had to say ""We're all going to die someday, why not take care of myself and do what I know is right, even if it's not easy?""

Unless you truly accept that quitting smoking will be a painful period of readjustment, then you can start to quit. If you don't want to, you won't. That's just human nature.

**2. Learn to be self-aware.** Cigarette smokers are typically ultra-senstive to their emotional states. That's why it's so hard to quit. You can physically feel when your body is craving a cigarette, the easier it is to pinpoint when you want to smoke and how to avoid those situations or at least endure them.

**3. Don't pretend it's ""just a bad habit"".** Your mind has become dependent on nicotine to survive. Let that sink in for a second. Your mind depends on nicotine to survive. The same way you need food, the more you've conditioned your mind and body to expect nicotine at certain intervals, and your emotional survival is largely dependent on it. You're like Pavlov's dog, conditioned to expect a cigarette every time a number of different things occur.

This is a perfect metaphor for what smoking does to your mind: http://static.themetapicture.com/media/elephant-tied-post-mindset-mind.jpg

So when you quit smoking

It takes years to adjust to being a non-smoker. It's a matter of **re-educating** your body, take a hit of weed, or do one of many other new habits that formed after I quit. These aren't perfect replacements, but over time you will adjust and your body will find a natural balance again.

Your actual psyche and personality depend on smoking to exist in their current state. When you quit smoking, these changes will be for the better.

**4. Stop thinking of your mind and body as different things.** You aren't your mind, the chemicals you put into your body will augment your mind and your view of reality. You can't hurt one at the benefit of the other. Take care of your body, and your mind will improve as a result from it. It just might have some growing pains.

**5. Make it easy for yourself.** Don't go from a pack a day to nothing cold turkey. I started by switching to American Spirit, and eventually just stopped.
Be realistic about it. Try not to take an 'all or nothing' approach to quitting - it's dramatic and shortsighted.

**6. Be prepared to make sacrifices.** Your grades, you gotta light?"" Those times when you're on the balcony, looking out at the city with a glass of whiskey in one hand and a cigarette in the other. You might even have to sacrifice a few friends. Over time you will make up for the temporary sacrifices - think of it like an investment you're making that will pay off in the long term.

**7. Exercise.** I don't need to elaborate here - but it is the best way I've dealt with stress after I quit smoking

I changed a lot when I quit smoking. I had to. Otherwise there was no way for this new amount of nervous energy to go anywhere. I work out almost daily now, but it's what happened). Instead of smoking a cigarette, I also learned to simply face my problems. I didn't hide from them or ignore them. I'm a better person now. I'm honest with myself. I'm mature and I'm stronger. 

The other day

So yes

Alan Carr's ""Easy Way to Stop Smoking"" lives up to the hype.  It's as good as anything you'll ever read on the subject

If you do decide to quit, they think that they have a powerful habit they're trying to resist.  Completely reject this thinking and live in the NOW.  When you stop smoking, you become a non-smoker.  That self-identification is really helpful.

Everyone's experience varies, but it isn't simply what I pictured when I thought of ""nicotine withdrawal.""  For example, smoking at night conditioned my brain to anticipate certain chemicals before sleeping, and when I quit, it took my body a while to adjust to sleeping without those chemicals.  I had a couple of weeks of restless sleep, and woke up, WIDE AWAKE, so that took readjustment.  Long after my initial nicotine withdrawal ended

The second month was a MASSIVE improvement over the first month.  My body rediscovered old routines, I watched wistfully when my friends at the pub headed out to smoke on the patio together, telling myself I was strong enough to resist the urge.  By month two, I often didn't notice they'd even left, and couldn't care less.  I did, however, notice how much their jackets and hair smelled like a wet ash tray.  

When I tried to quit in the past (have done this three or four times), but honestly, I was better off without them.  I had previously used them to conceal my nicotine addiction from relatives, so when I tried to use them to totally quit smoking, I think I subconsciously treated them as temporary fixes until I could get back to the real thing.  I had to reject the smoking cessation aids, all of them, and just quit cold turkey.  This has one other great upside:  When you quit this way, but I don't get those at all.  You're still addicted to nicotine

I lost weight when I quit smoking.  Pretty simple, I realized that quitting smoking could result in a much fatter me.  So I combined my quitting effort with a full-on cooking campaign and an interesting new diet (paleo, which you can check out at /r/Paleo), and I actually lost almost 30 pounds, all while my tobacco addiction was vanishing.  This also motivated me in quitting smoking!

I realize this has been a long post (sorry!), you are one step closer to being that pitiful person that sits in their car in a traffic jam, in the rain, with a window cracked and a desperate flaming butt protruding from the car, because you HAVE TO SMOKE.  You're one step closer to being the person who develops a hacking cough in their 40s that stays with them for the rest of their lives, one that will never go away.  The sad relative that shuffles outside periodically at every family function, slightly embarrassed in the knowledge that everyone else thinks they stink.  I didn't want to ever become that person

I always thought that the health problems associated with smoking will open happen to me when I'm over 60

The surprising thing is that I don't even smoke that much, thanks to smoking. Not genetics, not a bad diet, ALL because of smoking. But now alas it is time for me to stop before it quite literally kills me, and I really hope that you can do it too.

**Every conceivable situation in life is more enjoyable if you do not smoke - even the ones that we're conditioned to believe are ""made"" for lighting up** 

Example: On Sunday afternoon, pool + trees + low clouds. I had a favorite song on the iPod. Perfect time for a smoke right?

I gave up using the same technique my granddad used when he was told of he didn’t quit he would die. I picked a date

I didn’t tell anyone I was giving up until I was a week in. 
I kept a pack on me at all times for the first 6 months

Now 3 years in I no longer get cravings at all.
Now for the bit you will be down voting me

After 3 years I am treating myself to a Cigar

It won’t be my first since I Quit and it won’t be my last

We all have our own goals, something I used to use to mark special occasions and something I can enjoy with friends. 

Feel free to down vote me in to oblivion, preachy books (I hated Carrs book) or hypnosis. Its 3 simple things. 

1 Wanting to quit.
2 Picking a date and sticking to it!
3 Taking it one baby step at a time. 

TLDR: I quit 3 years ago but I still like to enjoy a cigar.

I swear to you that it's possible. 

I used to smoke a pack a day for 12 years. I quit cold turkey by reading the book and visiting this subreddit often. I suppose I could have waited until 100 days but I felt compelled to write right now. 

When I was starting off at day 1, sort of felt the same as day 1. Of course I was still craving, it doesn't just magically go away. A week came, WHAT A MILESTONE! Suddenly, 2 week. Then, BOOM, a month. Holy shit wtf I couldn't believe it. At week 1

What I'm trying to say is that it gets easier. I know it may seem like as days go

All you have to do is physically not smoke. You have to just not go to the store, but they only do 1 of 2 things. Either they pass, or they make you smoke one. At the moment, you may think that the craving will never pass and that nothing will make you feel right except for a cigarette. Well, that's just a drug addiction doing what it's suppose to do. It WILL pass, I promise. If it didn't, just imagine how all us non-smokers would be feeling right now.

Oh how fucking stupid I was.

I didn't know smoking made you so... tired.. 

I didn't know smoking robbed you of the ability to walk uphill and carry a conversation with someone at the same time. 

I didn't know smoking slowly

I just thought one day you'd get sick. I didn't know you'd be sick ALL THE TIME.

I used to do things. I used to be able to go out on the weekends and go to the beach, hang out with friends at a BBQ, chase the kids around, have waterfights with them. I used to wonder what people meant when they said they were so tired. It was an alien concept to me.

You get tired from walking? HA! How could anybody just get tired from walking for christ's sake. I never thought twice about a long haul uphill. Now I carefully plan my route to make sure I take the flattest road

I'm early to work not because punctuality is important to me

I turn down friends suggestions to go out and do shit. I say ""why can't we just go to the cafe/bar and chat?"" Because I'd rather smoke. Because all I think about is where I can sit to have a smoke. Before we go anywhere I need to know if I can smoke there

If you break it down

I'm jealous of non smokers. I wish I never knew what this was like. Because as much as people like to think smoking doesn't affect your functioning

Wanna go for a walk through the park, let's just sit somewhere in the shade. So I can smoke.

I'm no longer a person. Just a conduit for nicotine. All I do is smoke. I was not made to smoke


**-----------EDIT:--------------** 

For the past year I've been having dreams of when I was an early teen and a non smoker. In my dreams I am strong and capable and don't feel tired. Whenever I wake up its like holy fuck... this is what I've become. A skinny, then waking up just devastated. Difference is that this is something I can stop. I'm not trapped in my body. I make the choice to poison myself slowly. But then I feel... The damage is done. I can't undo it. The neural pathways in my drug addled brain are locked in tight and strong. I wish I could forget.

1.  You have to honestly want to quit and to do it for yourself - be resolute
2.  If I can do it then anyone can - have faith
3.  Don't listen to your scumbag trollbrain - have vigilance
4.  Tell yourself daily how fucking awesome you are - have pride
5.  Read this subreddit daily and comment on posts - have support
6.  Incorporate non-smoking in an overall lifestyle change.  It doesn't have to be nuts but walk every second day and eating better  - have a healthy mindset
7.  Not one puff
8.  If you fail then start right back up again
9.  To not smoke you have to actually stop smoking.  Don't do it. - have strength

Here are the key milestones - focus on each one in turn and don't look beyond them:

1 day, 2 weeks, 1 month, 2 months, 3 months, 6 months, 1 year

By the time you hit two weeks the worst of it is over

Hope this helps someone at the very least the actual writing of the post helps me (which is why I have posted so fucking much on this subreddit)  :)

Keep on keeping on.

One thing I noticed over my several attempts was the extreme way nicotine withdrawal distorts reality

1. Feeling:  You feel horrible right now.  In fact, that you will probably never feel happy again, but exist in a kind of half-alive state for the rest of eternity.  The only thing that can fix that is a cigarette.  Fact:  If you stay distracted for five minutes or so, you might forget that you ever felt that way.

2. Feeling:  You're craving... and right now a cigarette would be amazing, then sickening.  It's like psychic rape.

3.  That person over there is smoking... and he is the coolest person in the world.  How does he manage to look so cool?  *He* is successfully managing life

No.

I don't miss scrounging for change in the couch or sacrificing my last few dollars to buy another pack.

I don't miss yellow stains on my fingernails and teeth that don't go away.

I don't miss that frantic shower and load of laundry before meeting people to make a good impression.

I don't miss having a smelly car/apartment/wardrobe/life in general.

I don't miss not being able to smell my smelly life

I don't miss having a permanent cough

**But what about all the things you liked about smoking?**

Alcohol still gets you drunk, stressful sometimes, boring most of the time.

If I want an excuse to talk to a stranger

I don't need cigarettes to pep me up; I eat well and get enough sleep. Occasionally I'll drink coffee. I don't need cigarettes to calm me down; as it turns out the cigarettes were generally making me more anxious and smoking relieved those withdrawal symptoms.

**Okay, emotional part of me still just *wants* to smoke. Help?**

Yes

But here's what saved me in those moments in the past year:

1. From day one, my normal behavior is not smoking, ever. If I ever had doubts about what to do, I would simply decide to do what is normal behavior for me. Don't smoke.

2. I started exercising. I run ~15 miles spread over 6 days each week. You know it's what you need to do, tired) and the strategy in #1 isn't working, I remember that I have to run tomorrow, and smoking will ruin my progress.

3. Milestones work. I appreciate what you guys are doing, 1 week if that's what you need. But once you reach it, you also have to tell yourself as I am today, ""PSYCH! You have to go at least two years.""

Been a smoker since I was 19. Which according to my arithmetic was about a million years ago. 

The urologist removed a cancerous tumor the size of a quarter from my bladder. Luckily before it attached to my other organs. (If that happens then medically speaking


Men have two sets of plumbing. Located in the front yard (penis) and the back yard (anus). To remove a cancerous tumor from your bladder. The surgeon goes through the front yard.


The surgery pain is.... I'll put it this way. Remember what it felt like when you got kicked in the nuts? Well you'll wish it only felt that bad. And after your surgery. The urologist will be running a two foot long scope through your front yard every three months. ...yeah good times


My smoking was more than addiction. It was like a part of me. My twenty little friends named Camel


But cancer is a great clarifier

When that ugly hunger for a smoke starts screaming inside me. What's helped enormously these past few weeks. Is to use nicotine nasal spray. But I'd only recommend it to hardcore chain smokers trying to quit. You'll feel a chemical burning in your nose cavity


Good luck. And take a fool's advice. Don't wait until you're on an operating table trying to cut a deal with your maker for one more chance like I did. Now is the time to stop smoking. - Vic

I don't pretend to be some sort of expert on quitting

* **You have to really want it.** If you're quitting for someone else or just because you think you should, but if it's not ultimately coming from yourself it won't help.

* **The moment you quit smoking, one week, one day, one hour, or one minute. We are all non-smokers.

* **Cold turkey is what worked for me.** I had tried e-cigs, so this isn't a hard and fast rule, but smokers are nicotine addicts, plain and simple. The quicker you get the nicotine out of your system the quicker withdrawal will subside. All that being said, don't judge other people's methods. I've seen a lot of people on this sub look down on others for using NRT's or e-cigs. The most important thing is to get off tobacco. That is what is most dangerous. Encourage people to give cold turkey a try, but if it doesn't work for them, encourage them to use *any means necessary.*

* **Read Allen Carr's Easyway to Stop Smoking.** Yes, he's annoyingly repetitive. BUT IT WORKS! I didn't even have to get through half the book before I no longer wanted to smoke. It's not about learning some magical method, it's about changing your attitude towards smoking. It's about confronting and breaking down all those excuses and justifications that smokers use to continue their habit. Every single one of them is bullshit. Deep down we all know it, but we allow ourselves to fool ourselves. In these moments, it may seem like our rational brain talking, but that nicotine imp is pulling the strings.

* **Judge smokers harshly.** Not out loud. Don't be a jerk to them or anything, there was some trepidation over this part. Quitting is a mind game. The point is to convince yourself that quitting is the right thing to do and that you have power over the drug not the other way around. When I do this I'm not *actually* judging people, I'm playing a little mental game for myself to bolster my confidence.

* **Exercise whenever you get a craving.** It doesn't have to be super strenuous or anything, and help to offset the weight many former smokers gain when they quit.

* **Drink lots of water.** Most people are walking around slightly dehydrated anyway

* **Make new associations with things you did while smoking.** For example, I just needed to drink where there weren't smokers. Invite some nonsmoking friends over and have a few drinks and you'll begin to disassociate drinking with smoking. If it's not even an option to smoke, sometimes that keeps the cravings manageable. Did you have a cigarette every morning with a cup of coffee? Don't quit coffee, just do something else with it; read a book, or do a crossword or whatever... just make it something you enjoy doing that will occupy your mind while you're having coffee. Sooner or later you'll think about that thing rather than lighting up.

* **Know that you will most likely always have cravings.** Be prepared for that. My dad quit 10 years ago, so I don't. With another 100 days under my belt, it's still true that the longer you go without smoking, the easier it gets in general, but there are going to be days and weeks that it gets hard again. When the weather started getting warmer, I had about a week where it was almost as difficult as those first few weeks. Occasionally I'd smell tobacco smoke and breathe in deeper. The smell didn't make me sick like it had been. Cravings were stronger and frequent. I thought about smoking and it didn't strike me as foreign and disgusting anymore. That passed, but it really surprised me. Know that this is always a possibility, in some way

* **There's no such thing as ""just one.""** We're addicts and we'll always be addicts. A little bit of nicotine will most likely pull you back into full on cravings and daily cigarettes. This goes for other forms of tobacco too. I'd love it if I could enjoy a pipe or cigar once in a while

* **Don't beat yourself up if you relapse.** One day not smoking is infinitely healthier for you than zero days not smoking. Congratulate yourself on making it as far as you have, and eventually those little bits of time will add up to a lot.

* **Set your badge on this subreddit.** Also get an app like QuitNow! or Cessation Nation. Watching that timer tick up is really satisfying and

* **Figure out how much money you spent per month on cigarettes and sock it away.** You were obviously able to live without that cash when you were smoking, use it each month to buy yourself something fun or go out to eat or something.

* **Become an active poster on this subreddit.** At the very least

* **You have done the impossible

To all those who are considering quitting

The cravings still come periodically but every time I feel it. I just quietly chant "" I am a non smoker "" and the monkey moves away for a while.

My resting heart rate is down to 60-65 on average. It was closer to 80 a week ago.

I can walk to work everyday now. Run up stairs (how ever dangerous). Lift/carry heavy objects with no shortness of breath. I get home in the evenings and don't feel the need to lay down for an hour anymore.

My mind is even a clearer now that I'm not thinking about that nicotine fix every 30minutes.

Nothing but positives to outweigh those irregular anxious cravings that come and go.

1) I still get pangs of cravings. But they aren't normal ""I-really-need-a-cigarette-right-now"" cravings, ""Why? You'll smell like smoke, you'll beat yourself up, it isn't worth it."" And it goes **away**. As soon as I preoccupy myself, they're gone. I'd rather deal with little tiny thoughts for the rest of my life than smelling like smoke and sacrificing my health.

2) I initially replaced cigarettes with food

3) Things seriously *taste* and *smell* different. I didn't really expect it

4) I don't have to stand out in the increasingly-uncomfortable warm weather to suck down a cigarette. One of my biggest fears is wasps

5) The smell was a big deterrent for me. Health was less of a factor when I quit

6) My teeth have whitened! Incredible.

7) My dating prospects have opened up since I quit. Now I've got a few dates lined up with guys who aren't smokers

8) I'm handling stress much easier now. I never thought I'd say that

9) I don't have to accommodate my habit when I go out anymore. So instead of asking ""Does [the bar] allow smoking?"" now

10) Just by me quitting, I've become an inspiration for people who know me. That's a big motivator to help me stay smoke-free! :)

Upon my fifth Dr. visit

The nicotine I had been using for 25 years had been serving as a sort of treatment for the depression through its chemical release of endorphins.  By quitting smoking

I am also not alone.  Studies suggest that up to 25% of smokers suffer from some sort of chemical imbalance that keeps them hooked much harder than other people.  So much so that it has been reported that people with Depression have a less that 6% chance to quit smoking for a year without alternative treatment. 

My message is a simple one.  If you are still feeling nasty pangs after 3 weeks or a month

ALSO keep an eye on your blood pressure.  It should go down after you quit.  If it starts going up

Smoking is shitty. We all know that. It stains your teeth, but I've never heard of someone saying that smoke smells good), and it leaves that smell on almost everything you come in contact with. It lowers your physical abilities, increases your chances of heart disease and cancers. But the worst part: it's fucking expensive. If you smoke one pack a day, you're going to be spending over $1500 a year on cigarettes. And for what? Those 5 minute breaks every hour? Not worth it.

You have to convince yourself that smoking is bad, you obviously **don't** want to do it anymore or you wouldn't be here, right? So stop smoking. Seriously. Look at your pack of cigarettes right now. Open it up. Look at the cigarettes. Look at them. Seriously, stare them down. Those skinny little life-fuckers are going to kill you. And they aren't even going to be quick about it. They're going to make you smell like an ashtray, run up your heart rate, and make your skin pale. You don't want that. Fuck those things. Seriously. Well, not literally


Feeling angry yet? If not, it's a plan to keep doing all the things you did when you quit. Your 5 minute breaks are still possible. You can take a breather. Only now you'll *actually* be **breathing**. Go to a quiet place on your breaks. Go away from the smokers. You can meet up with them another time, but right now, on your break, it's **your** time. It isn't time for those nasty little cigarettes either. Take deep breaths. Focus on the trees. Focus on the sky. Listen to the birds. Hell, listen to the cars whizzing by on the road. Focus on something else and let your mind wander. Don't even think about those piece of shit cigarettes. Think about yourself just wandering around the forest, all by yourself, for Christ's sake. We raised half a million dollars for underprivileged kids. We helped Egyptians take back their country. You're a part of something bigger. You're not the voluntary customer of a product that will physically and financially harm you

How do you feel now? Empowered? Can you take on the world? Can you kill a bear? Can you feed millions? I bet you fucking can. But guess what - you don't have to! You just have to quit smoking. And that shit is fucking easy. Millions of people have already done that shit. Smoking sucks. You know it too! Just think about how pissed off you were at those stinky little fucking pricks. You can do this. Carpe diem! Sieze the day! Then fuck it! Fuck smoking! You can do whatever the fuck you want!

Some fun facts about smoking and quitting:

1) Those who have quit by the age of 35 have about the same life expectancy as those who have never smoked before.

2) For every year after 35 that a smoker quits

3) It's much harder to quit if you started before the age of 15 since that's the time your brain is still developing and is more vulnerable to addictions.

4) Nicotine by itself has shown few harmful effects on the body aside from some cardiovascular effects. It might actually help in cognitive function if administered the correct way.

5) Gums and patches have a fairly low success rate on their own, as FDA has recently announced, you CAN keep using it even if you continue to smoke. Prior to a few months ago, they were saying that if you relapse you have to stop using it. Well, that was crap, so...yea.

6) A lot of smokers say that they smoke out of stress. However

7) You might gain weight when you quit smoking. Ex-smokers are on average heavier than those who have never smoked

8) E-cigarettes are awesome. They're not FDA approved so you still run the risk of having crap in there that's not good for you (and my VP kinda gave me a disapproving look when I told him I was using one), if you like smoking hookah, the smoke consistency is pretty similar if you use a good quality e-cig (thick enough is thick enough to blow awesome rings with). I love it.

9) There are more former smokers in the world than there are smokers. More than half of all smokers in the world have already quit. It can be done!

Tips on how to quit:

* Choose a quit day and stick to it.  Make it about a month ahead of time so you have some time to prepare yourself.
* Don't do it alone! Let someone know you're actively trying to quit smoking. Obviously
* Understand that you're biologically dependent on a drug now. You've changed your body's baseline so that it only feels normal when you have nicotine in your system. If you try to quit without the aid of nicotine
* Start using NRT (nicotine replacement therapy) about two weeks prior to your quit date. Smoke as usual during this time. I found that during my two week pre-quit period
* On your quit day, etc. That means your lighters, matches, cartons, packs, ashtrays...whatever it is, it has to go. If you're like me and you have a really nice ashtray that is a nice collector's item that you'd like to hold onto
* Keep yourself out of situations where you'd have a cigarette. I used to smoke a lot when I was out at bars with friends. I haven't stopped going out to bars
* If you relapse and have a cigarette

Drinking by the campfire, the cigarette would remind me what a great time I’m having. I’ve realized that I can have these little moments to myself without risking my body.
I really want to stop. I hate being outwitted by addiction. I want to exercise my willpower and beat this thing. I’ve been smoking for the past seven years and I’ve finished Day 1. I believe you should have the freedom to put whatever you want into your body

1367971312.0,1dwbt4,Don't kid yourself: e-cigarettes are not helpful.,,125,39,135,"Hi everyone

I was tobacco-free for close to a year. I first quit by will power. Recently,"" I told myself, and ""I won't smoke it very often."" I didn't recognize the ""just one"" fallacy I was committing.

Fast forward a month and I was a frazzled, I would hit it in all sorts of public indoor non-smoking places, like the grocery store. You don't have to wait for an entire cig to burn, you can take one drag and put it back away. They're cheaper than cigarettes. They taste better, they're not as harsh, and you can change the flavor at will. There's no butt to throw away. Where cigarettes were a hassle, e-cigarettes were perfectly convenient, except maybe charging.

Easily accessible, but it wasn't happening. Every day I had it, I increased usage by some tiny amount. It was getting ridiculous.

So one day, so I couldn't dig through the trash later when I wanted to smoke. I watched the garbage truck take it away...and that's when I knew I had a problem. My nicotine cravings were insane. I wasn't ready for it. Panicked, I went for a run to calm my nerves. I didn't plan it, but I found myself purchasing cigarettes at the gas station. I rationalized and made promises to myself and fell right back into being a ""confirmed smoker,"" just like I was before. E-cigarettes brought me into the pattern stronger than ever before. I never used to smoke more than half a pack a day, but within a few days I was smoking more than one pack every day, trying to achieve the same crazy nicotine levels of the e-cigarette.

How did I quit again? I read Easy Way

**TL;DR It is my personal opinion that e-cigarettes won't help you quit. They just re-enforce all aspects of the addiction

Edit: OK, but that's what I did, and quitting cigarettes was really easy by comparison. I don't mean to disparage. Go forth! Stop smoking! Do what you want! I do mean to warn that if you're like me, you'll get super hyper addicted to e-cigs. Thanks.",,False,,1368027108.0,t3_1dwbt4

&gt; Help me stop smoking. 

No. I won't help you. I can't help you

Quitting smoking has to come from within. A few questions for you:

* You say you are a bit less than a pack a day smoker. How many days do you lie to yourself about smoking less than a pack? I seem to recall lying to myself about smoking less than a pack, this is just a temporary cough/cold)?

* Why do you want to quit? I mean, why do you want to quit? Bad day? The money? Lungs feel hot?

* What is your favorite thing about smoking? What about your favorite brand? Also

Answer those questions then read on. Answer them truthfully. **Write them down**; not typed, do it neatly. This is important, right?

---

Now that you've answered the questions, let's go over those questions.

1.) If you say you haven't lied concerning your disgusting, but you've fallen right into big tobacco's trap. It's time to break the trap, my friend.

2.) A temporary quit is **WORSE** than anything ever. The feeling you get when you relapse is equivalent to 10x the depression that every American feels when they hear about the cast of The Jersey Shore in the news. Plus

3.) I personally liked the feeling of smoke going into my lungs. That was the greatest. Except for when I would wake up COUGHING AND WHEEZING AND **I WASN'T ABLE TO LAUGH WITHOUT COUGHING**! You may not be at that point, soon [it will be too late](http://whyquit.com/whyquit/bed.jpg). ~~Smoking does not relieve stress.~~ Smoking only relieves the stress that **NICOTINE CREATES**. It is a trap that you can break **EASILY** with a few days of **MILD ANXIETY**. That's it. No pain, just a few days of light insomnia and grouchiness.

Write down 10 people that you are closest to on a new sheet of paper. NOT THE BACK

Mom, Sister(s), Aunt(s), Uncle(s), **PEOPLE YOU SEE EVERY DAY ARE A PLUS**.

Take your pack and dump the cigarettes in a bowl - LEAVE THE THREE CIGARETTES OUT. Fill the bowl with water **JUST HIGH ENOUGH TO COVER THE CIGARETTES**.

You are about to become a non-smoker. You will have ups. You will have downs. You will enjoy every moment of it. **LAUGH** at the thought of those stupid, that plant is **COVERED WITH STUFF DESIGNED TO BOTH KILL YOU AND KEEP YOU ADDICTED**!! What kind of sick bastard would design that? A greedy motherfucker, that's who. You're done giving them any of your money.

Smoke one cigarette. Ash into the bowl. Read this while smoking:

Why do you smoke? Do you honestly enjoy it? I thought I did, one before bed - hell, one during bedtime sometimes! And if I went out? Add **AT LEAST** half a pack extra to my daily tally. Inhale deeply and meaningfully. If smoking were truly enjoyable, you would be doing it ALL THE TIME. Why take a break? When you are done with that cigarette put it out in the bowl.. **and light the next one, your FINAL cigarette** - but not with a lighter. Take the first sheet you wrote your answers to, and light it on fire. When it's almost completely burned out, light your last cigarette with it. You know the lies you told yourself, and are realizing that the biggest lie was that you actually enjoyed the crap. You don't need the paper to **free yourself from the trap**.

Daunting, you will kick the habit. Smoking is silly, you smell like shit and the opposite sex is repulsed by your stench. And you look stupid as hell, too. You don't look cool, dark, or brooding - you look like a crackhead who needs to get his fix, but his fix is never enough. Finish that cigarette and think about why you don't want to smoke ever **EVER** again. Put it out in the bowl as well. Notice how disgusting that water is getting. That disgusting, and will be working it's way out for the next couple weeks.

Finally, I can't help you quit, and I won't share your **mild anxiety**. You do this for you and **you will find freedom** from ~~cancer~~ smoking.

Congrats on being a non-smoker! Now get yourself a motherfucking badge.

I know a lady who has horrible emphysema.  I was diagnosed with a ferociously aggressive breast cancer and am now undergoing Chemo.

I was at 21 days and ran out of patches so what do I do?  Buy smokes. Pathetic. 
I figured I wasn't making any progress with my addiction to nicotine while on the patch and so when I ran out I talked myself into thinking a few smokes can't hurt till I get more patches (Costco has the best deal on them but its far from my home - I'll get there) 
Am I stuck in a loop now?  I don't see myself ever graduating to the next level of patches as the first one barely got me through the cravings.  Should I start a sub reddit for Patch Addicts?

At a month now and 2 months seems very possible. 

I just want to let all the resolutioners know that it's very possible!!  This sub helps immensely...just a few pointers:

- Read the book everyone is raving about. The way he un-brainwashes you is exactly what all of zombified smokers need.

- Wait out the cravings. It will pass. DO NOT LISTEN TO YOUR BRAIN! Cravings do 1 of 2 things...pass or make you smoke one. LET IT PASS!

- Don't take quitting too seriously. Make the choice to quit and don't make a big old deal about it. I learned to shrug off the fact that I quit


And let me tell you guys, after a big meal, before/after I shower, I pick up the phone, start driving, DRINKING ALCOHOL, before/after work, after sex or fapping

I was an anxious wreck who depended on cigs for....  for...

Then it hit me.  Im depending on cigs for everything
I realized the little fuckers were brainwashing me into thinking I AM THE PROBLEM

So i said FUCK YOU.  And took my life back.  All the reasons i COULDNT QUIT were perpetrated by the CIGS THEMSELVES.  *When you quit
Cigarettes are basically an ABUSIVE PARTNER that creates the problems

They make you depressed - then tell you they are an anti-depressant.

They make you lethargic - then tell you cigs are exciting.

They make you anxious - then tell you they relax you.

They make you lonely - then tell you your special.

They make you sick - then tell you it's medicine.

They make you smelly and gross - then tell you that you're cool and suave.

They make you burn money - then tell you its worth every penny.

They fill you with doubt - then tell you cigs make you confident.

They create fear - then tell you they give you courage.

They make you impotent - then tell you they are amazing after sex.

THEY LIE TO YOU! THEY'VE CAUSED EVERY PROBLEM YOU'VE EVERY HAD WITH THEM.   IT IS NOT YOUR FAULT - IT IS THEIR FAULT!  You MUST forgive yourself

Now
But you MUST commit to HATING nicotine.  Any mental doubts will manifest themselves as physical withdrawal symptoms - this is how nicotine hooks

This is a BATTLE that you will WIN.  Ironically, and therein lies its only weakness: *It depends on your mistakes for survival.*

If you feel like your making a sacrifice, you aren't being deprived of ANYTHING.  Cigarettes have NOTHING to offer besides POINTLESS DEPENDENCY and AGONIZING DEATH. Let me reiterate:    *A.G.O.N.I.Z.I.N.G.   D.E.A.T.H.*

If you KEEP LOVING YOURSELF

FUCK EM!  It's you or them.

The first week was abysmal. I warned everyone that I'd be... crabby. Due to going cold turkey I let my kids school know that everything would be a bit over emotional over the next few weeks. I chose the most low interaction jobs at work so I could hide away from snapping at people. 


I tried my first night out

I kept my rolling tobacco and papers in my bag, and told myself I was choosing not to smoke. I mean, I could smoke anything I wanted to, the stuff was right there! But I was choosing not to do so. I was choosing to be healthy and happier.

Okay it hasn't solved all my problems. I now eat even more crap than I used to (not as a mouth fixation problem

About a month ago I wanted to smoke again so badly it shocked me. But I got through it. The most frustrating part is when people who still smoke tell me 'Oh yes, and I still get phlegmy and coughing. I would have thought that would be over but apparently not. 

It got better over the course of the year. Wow, purse, fags, keys. I still think 'Perfect time for a ciggie' after being in the cinema or enclosed areas for a long time. Maybe that'll never leave, maybe I'll always have those thoughts. 

But I have made an amazing choice that benefits me, and the way I look at life. Life is too precious to spend it hacking up phlegm and cutting time off of your life, now and later.

My 2 cents? If you're like me - all your friends continue to smoke cigarettes. Don't give up those little breaks/social sessions! Go outside with them every time. Fold your arms and just enjoy the company. The biggest mistake I made when I used to ""try"" quitting was sitting alone inside while everyone else went out to smoke a cigarette - there's a big social angle you're missing trying it that way! Get used to turning down the offer for a smoke

I know it gets said again and again. But do or don't quit. There is certainly no try. Decide you are not going to be a smoker anymore

There will be times that you're pissed off or frustrated and ready to give up, that's why!! This was my most dangerous trigger, but don't kid yourself! It's all about you.

1313240676.0,jhnsu,"Allen Carr's book ""The Easy Way to Stop Smoking"" is not magic",QuestionableExSmoke,77,7,25,"When I first heard mention of this book

This book is not about brainwashing. I keep seeing it mentioned alongside words such as 'miracle', undermine the core value of the book. It is descriptions like these that led me to write it off for so long.

One day

The book is repetitive and poorly written. I couldn't put it down. Allen Carr is a genius.

The beauty of this book, I knew I was addicted. I couldn't deny that. But I did not know why. I assumed that, whilst nicotine was indeed rather moreish, the addiction came from the fact it was so awesome. One by one the book breaks down the psychology behind the truths you believed so absolutely. Beliefs which you never questioned since they seemed so obvious. Beliefs which kept your junkie mind continuing to allow you to smoke.

The basic premise behind the book is that you are addicted to nicotine. Not the physical act of smoking. ""Bullshit!"", there are none. Not if you are honest with yourself and really consider the arguments made.

The main point I didn't realise before reading the book was how nicotine addiction actually works. The idea that all non-smokers are at a default level of ""stress"" whilst a smoker spends 90% of their time over this line was horrifying to me. A cigarette will briefly bring the smoker back to near a ""normal"" level before steadily increasing the stress levels until the next fix. It makes so much sense. It provides answers to the many paradoxes of smoking. This book provides great reasons for why every belief you have about smoking stems from being an addict. Social smokers included.

So, I’m not. I’m an ex smoker. While smoking no longer plays a relevant role in my life, I still remember “good times”, even if those were illusions. I know that a single cigarette will bring back all the bad habits again. 

For me, starting an active lifestyle, including sports and eating healthy. I even earned myself a reputation for being a health nut (you don’t know me, so - unfortunately - I can’t explain how ridiculous that still sounds to me). It would just make no sense for me to eat healthy, so sports and smoke. At least in my understanding.

My word of warning is this. Once you are a smoker, you are always a smoker. I watched it happen to my sister and brother in law, they quit for almost a year and then they were right back on it. It happened to me after 4 years. Once you beat it, do not EVER go back. Do not flirt with it, do not pretend you can have just one. **Once a smoker, always a smoker.**

I regularly went to school/work still feeling an afterglow from the night before or using a stimulant.

I had quit smoking for a period of about 3 months in 2013, so 4+ years is a relatively large chunk of my life.

Consistent fatigue, a scratchy throat, shortness of breath...all of these signs of dis-ease became my norm.  I completely lost sight of what good health felt or looked like.  I kept telling myself, one day, one day.  One day I would stop and get my shit together.  But I kept putting it off because I was scared.  A life of self-destruction (even beyond the substances) was all I had known for a really long time.  And I guess I also didn't realize just how incredibly poor my health was.  You don't realize how much these things effect you until you take them away because you become desensitized.  You build a tolerance.

And then I finally realized

I cannot begin to describe just how *good* I feel.  The first few days were a little bumpy, I sleep soundly, I wake up energized, I can smell, I can taste, I breathe evenly...the list goes on and on.  Plus, I'm saving tons of money.  I had no idea that I could physically feel this amazing.

Additionally, not dieting to deprive it.

I know that was a bit of a read

For those of you trying to quit, and that's where the trouble starts. Compete with another quitter who you truly value the opinion of and/or loathe the idea of losing to. Quit on a Friday if you haven't yet, or take the first day or two of work if you didn't (and if you can). Get as much sleep as you can the first 48 hours to combat the withdrawals. They do go away, quicker than you think actually. And remember, you ARE an asshole those first few days, so don't make any drastic statements or decisions regarding other life matters, remind yourself you truly are NOT of sound mind right then. Get something indulgent and reward yourself when you fight an urge to smoke. Keep a running count each day of how much money you've saved. Pick something out to buy with the sixth month's or one year's total so that you have something tangible to work towards. Tell your people when you are having a craving, you can

- I used to stress out about where

- I don't smell like smoke.  I've had many people comment on that, since I couldn't tell.  My car also no longer smells like smoke anymore either.

- More time to eat.  It used to be if I ever had a few spare moments, I guarantee I would've chosen to smoke over eating if I could only do one.

- I used to annoy my friends when watching movies at home.  I always would stop a movie multiple times to go have smoke breaks.  Also

- Money!  I've saved a few hundred dollars now.  Since I quit smoking I've been putting the money I would've spent on packs into a savings account.  I was originally going to buy myself something as a reward when I reached 3 months

- Health.  I've noticed some changes in how I feel.  I don't run out of breathe as easily

Now I am leaving you for good.

It has been three days since we last saw each other. In the past I would have come home crying by now. We would have embraced as soon as we saw each other. I would apologize for hurting you and trying to leave. You would comfort me by wrapping me up in a nasty cloud of poisons

Not anymore.

Not this time. NOT EVER AGAIN. I finally have my head on straight. I have never felt better in my life and for the first time I can clearly see that coming back to you would be the biggest mistake I could ever make

As I have had time two reflect on our years together I have made a list of all the negatives and positives we have shared....

NEGATIVES:
You stink

My throat always hurts after we are together

My breath stinks when I am with you

I always feel unmotivated with you

You give me weird chest pains (not in a good or cute way)

I see you with so many others and realize what we have isn't special. You're peddling your lies to a lot of other people

All those times you made me feel cool or special

I am more relaxed since we broke up than I ever was while with you. You never relaxed me. You just aggravated me so much it felt like relaxation when it really wasn't.

You never let me walk for longer than a few minutes without making me feel crappy and tired. 

We can never go hiking. 

Things seem to taste bland and smell less when we're together

POSITIVES:










So you can see, it is just not me. Not anymore. Never again.

- I had more energy

- I had more cash

- my pockets had more space

- I could taste food much better

- I had more TIME

- my house was cleaner

- my mood swings subsided

- I could afford top quality cannabis

- I felt like I was doing something to make my life better

- I could run after a streetcar without almost passing out after 100 meters.

today is a special day because 2 years ago I quit smoking. I just wanted to drop by and say hi and send all my best wishes to people who are in the process of quitting

I smoked for 16 years, but I wasn't really that motivated and always ended up buying a new pack after a few days/weeks.

4 years ago I bought the book on Allen Carr's method. I read it a few times but I still wasn't that motivated

2 years ago I decided that I had enough if this and said to myself that I would stop smoking. Just that. I would stop smoking and would not get any kind of nicotinic substitutes

so on october 9th, the inner fight against the craving was a tough one. But it got better and better each day, I was getting the use of my taste buds back, I wasn't having my chronic sinuses problems any more, I was breathing deeper and better... 

One of the key thing that helped me hold tight and not give up was that after a few weeks, when I had to get into the ""cool habit"", forcing the smoke into my lung and holding it while suppressing the coughing and fighting the dizziness... so every time I was near a cigarette smoker this memory of when I started was coming back to me, making me think ""No way I'm going back through all of this""

Only downside to stopping is that I took some weight

What I want to say today here is: if you want to quit or are in the process of quitting

In my opinion you shouldn't use nicotinic substitute. The best way (obviously the best IMO since it's the one that worked for me) is to quit once and for all. You smoke your last cigarette and you're done with it. that's it. Don't make things take too much time


And when you stop

I had a quit going 7 months last year and started back like many others.  A month in again now and here is  something that I have learned from my experience and from subscribing to this sub that I would like to share. 

It is about relapse

**It is because you forget.**

Or maybe more precisely you no longer accurately remember? I know it is a slight difference

After the cravings are down and it has been months since you smoked and you don't think about it as much

*  How it made you weak
*  How it made you feel sick
*  How much you spent on it
*  How it made you stink
*  How it made you cough
*  How you were addicted and it was not in your control
*  How you never thought that when you had your first smoke you would be smoking a pack a day 20 years later

Never forget and try to  remember these things every day after your first month or so. And first and foremost remember **smoking sucks**.

Smoked heavy (10+/day) for 3 years. I tried quitting a few times but if you half-ass it you play these stupid mind games with yourself where you pretend to resist but actually you subconsciously made the decision to light up long before. You ALL know what I'm talking about. Looking at that damn stick, a flick and bam, resentment, ""Why the fuck did I do this yet again"". That wasn't even a question, you knew damn well why.

Good thing is you can stop this bullshit with some good ol' Pavlovian trickery. I found it easy to stop in the end purely because everytime I'd light up it felt abysmal. I ceased without a single 'craving' in a textbook Allen Carr fashion. Fact is you can totally switch off the part of you that is a 'smoker': that pathway in your brain that craves, long after you *quit* to say ""yeah, one cigarette couldn't possibly hurt it's been so long"".

It's all about how you relate to the rush of chemicals from the hit. Going by subjective personal experience a cig is literally as powerful as a rock of crack in generating a reward pathway rush for the first brief seconds. Not necessarily a pleasant rush - but to that pathway



Through the tar-coated lenses of addiction it's a blissful release. When you're fed, and smoking 30 of these fuckers a day you don't notice any individual cig. That's only because you're nourished! Do this little experiment for yourself  and I mean ACTUALLY do this: Stay awake a long time, let yourself get really hungry &amp; dehydrated, deplete everything. In that empty state, nourishment feels like nourishment and poison feels like poison.

Now smoke a cigarette and pay attention. Feel that? A wave rushes through your body and it feels like dysphoria



Why? Everytime you've done it before, sex + poison, break from stress + poison, sleep + poison: these are the cues it's recieving. Each of the cues that precede the poison are hard wired as positive, the brain reasons that poison comes straight after viscerally good things therefore ""poison = good"". Whoops!

What you want to do is purely pay attention to that toxic feeling each and every time you smoke. Make a big deal out of it, toxified, poisoned, feel that you're rotting and decaying because you are! All this time you'd light that deathsicle up with an 'aaaaah', relief at last. No. That's how it gets you.

The reason cigs remotely have any allure after you 'quit' is because the last couple dozen memories you had of smoking consist of ""aaaaah, let it gradually happen. Once the mere thought of lighting up becomes detestable and actually doing so feels wretched it's time to quit: when each puff is like stepping on a lego, jumping up in pain then stubbing your toe, it's time. It's the Allen Carr method from here onwards.



A craving is not the same thing as a memory! ""I **need** a cigarette"" is a craving

Cravings are physical

To get past the hurdle of the physical addiction


**Another lifehack:** I found that drinking heavily totally switches off the physical addiction until it's totally metabolised. Down a bottle of some spirits and head to hangover land. Smoke your last cig before you go to sleep and that's that. Somehow the alcohol metabolises in such a way as to plug the neurotransmitter void left by tobacco for a few days. I'd love to know the pharmacology behind this! This might not work for everyone but it was very effective for me.

I had been a smoker for about 10 years and tried several times to quit.  I was never what I would consider to be a really heavy smoker.  I probably averaged about half a pack a day during the week (I didn't want to smoke at work)

In 1998 I got married to a great woman who over looked my faults.  She wasn't happy I smoked

But one day when she was about 18 months old, pointed at em and said ""BUBBLES!!""  That broke my heart right then and there.  She thought I was blowing bubbles, while in reality I was killing myself.  To this day I still tear up thinking about it.  I decided right there that enough was enough and July 12th was my first full day of being smoke free.

It wasn't easy.  Took lots of Nicorette to quit.  But I haven't had a single cigarette since.  Each day I kept thinking if I have a cigarette now, but now that they do they are very proud of me.  My oldest (who I quit for) even wrote her DARE essay about me and how I quit smoking for her.

For those in the process or are thinking about quitting by lurking here, you won't succeed.  You need to do it for yourself, and hopefully that time will come before it is too late.

I haven't even had a drag of a cigarette in the past 10 months, that doesn't count as quitting"" (Even though no one knows for sure what the long term affects of e-cigs are) I AGREE WITH YOU. 

BUT... an E-cig is the perfect transitional lubricant between smoking and not smoking. Don't consider it a replacement for cigarettes

One day I left the ecig at home

From my experience getting used to smoking the e-cig makes you realize that you don't NEED cigarettes. once you're on the e-cig long enough you'll realize you're not as addicted to that as you were cigarettes making it a lot easier to toss it and live the smoke free life. I love it

Sorry for the long winded story but I thought I'd just try and give a rundown for anyone not strong enough to go cold turkey or sick of other alternatives. 

Feel free to ask any questions!

1. Exercise
2. Drinking lots of water.
3. Meet any cravings with the ""why I want to quit smoking"" list.
4. Eating and enjoying it without rushing to smoke.
5. Dissociating alcohol drinking with smoking.
6. Cleaning.
7. Knowing that one smoke will destroy my plan.
8. Learning that idle time does not need to be filled with cig smoking.
9. Living vicariously through other smokers. Just because they do
10. Remembering that the plan is to be smoke-free. Do not deviate from the plan.

This is what's been working. The exercise has been the best. What better way to compliment the switch to a healthier lifestyle than with exercise? I personally need it

Since I'm in a rather somber mood I will skip the self-congratulatory animated gif and will instead offer some thoughts to the smokers who are lurking here.

Quitting smoking is not really about forcing yourself to abstain from something it is about realizing that you are enslaved and deciding that you want to be free.  It is about firmly accepting that there is no such thing as one cigarette.  Believe me - I quit for five years and swore I would never go back and then thought I could have just one.  Like an alcoholic who has abstained for a while and now thinks he is ""in control"" I was quickly back in the grips of my addiction.  

The simple fact is that each and every cigarette you smoke is a vote.  A vote for what you ask?

Let's add some music appropriate for the gravity of the decision that faces you.  If you will

Now that cigarette in front of you represents not just itself but thousands more.  This is truth and you know it.  Look into *your* future and see a mound of butts ten feet tall.  Imagine in fast-forward **all** of them passing through your lips

That is not just one cigarette in front of you is it?  To smoke *that one cigarette* is to give an unwilling nod to the above.  When you dip your head to your lighter you are bowing to your addiction.  Are you not sick of this servitude?  Are you still willing to play the cat-and-mouse game that is what you know to be true vs the delusion of your addiction?

It's all right there - right in front of you.  Wrapped in bright white paper.  You can stress about it and believe that smoking is going to help with that stress or you can choose to be free and welcome with tremendous relief each and every moment of withdrawal for it is a small price to pay for your freedom.

I recommend Allen Carr's book to anyone that is determined to quit smoking. Although, and I didn't even finish the reading the entire book.

The book is helpful in putting many things into perspective



##Here's my advice and this is what I tell everyone who is a smoker that's tried to quit and failed in the past.



**You're Not Just Addicted

You're not a bad person, oxy, whatever addict. Your life is defined by the incessant need to reward your brain with nicotine within certain time intervals. Your life is controlled not by you, but by one of the most efficiently addictive substances on earth: nicotine. Realize you will forever be addicted to nicotine. Even if you stop smoking for 5, 10 , 20 years. You will always be addicted to nicotine. That will never change. Understand this. Accept this. Learn to live with this concept. You can never have just one cigarrette. Forget special occassions, stressful moments, etc. Think of cigarettes like a good friend that died suddenly.  There one day

**You're Paying A Corporation To Kill You.**

The most important part of your being, and happiness) manufactures for the express purpose of getting you addicted in order to take your money on a regular basis. You are essentially a puppet. A drone. In the matrix, so to speak. You're paying someone to kill you slowly. Death by a thousand cuts and you're gladly paying good money for each of those cuts. Screw these multinational corporate pigs. Think about those around you, that care about you, that want nothing but the best for you. They want you healthy and happy. The cigarette companys only care about your money and your utility as a returning customer. A slave. They don't care about you, they hate you. You kill the things you hate, right? They're killing you and making a healthy profit. That's adding insult to serious injury. 

**Your Brain Can Convince You Of Anything.**

Your brain's essential function is survival at all cost; keeping you alive is job numero uno. Nicotine short-circuits this instinct. You know smoking causes cancer and will probably kill you. That it ravages your body and shortens your life span. You know these things, would you? Of course not, you can die from that. Yet, your brain demands you poison yourself 15 - 20+ times a day and you do it. 

Like I mentioned before, again. Con-man brain doesn't care if I live or die a painful death struggling to breath. Should I listen to con-man brain? Start thinking in these terms and you'll begin to realize that what you think are the involuntary actions of addiction are actually very voluntary and controllable. 

**It's Hard To Quit Smoking. No It's Not.**

It's hard to change a behaviour, during my work break, after lunch, after dinner, while I'm drinking with friends, at the bar, after sex. I NEED it. No you don't. You don't need it. You'd like it. You like doing it.  But that isn't the same as needing it. You NEED oxygen, and you know why?  Because you were able to perform all these tasks before you started smoking. Remember you weren't always a smoker. You lived a smoke free life once and you can do it again. 

Quitting is about control. It's that simple. Control of your mind. Who are you going to allow to control your mind? Yourself or the nicotine? Would you allow anyone but yourself to control your mind? Are you a slave? No of course

Quitting is easy. It really is. It's easy if you understand why you're quitting and what to expect when you quit. It's easy if you realize the real battle is not between you and your ""habit"" of smoking, NO. I won't let you determine my actions anymore. I won't let you convince me that I can't change my behavior. It's just noise. Like a spoiled child crying for a toy. It's. Just. Noise. That pang for a smoke is just a temper tantrum your brain is throwing and you are strong enough to say NO. The more times you say NO, the easier it becomes. The quietter it becomes. Eventually there is silence.

Smoking is shitty. We all know that. It stains your teeth, but I've never heard of someone saying that smoke smells good), and it leaves that smell on almost everything you come in contact with. It lowers your physical abilities, increases your chances of heart disease and cancers. But the worst part: it's fucking expensive. If you smoke one pack a day, you're going to be spending over $1500 a year on cigarettes. And for what? Those 5 minute breaks every hour? Not worth it.

You have to convince yourself that smoking is bad, you obviously don't want to do it anymore or you wouldn't be here, right? So stop smoking. Seriously. Look at your pack of cigarettes right now. Open it up. Look at the cigarettes. Look at them. Seriously, stare them down. Those skinny little life-fuckers are going to kill you. And they aren't even going to be quick about it. They're going to make you smell like an ashtray, run up your heart rate, and make your skin pale. You don't want that. Fuck those things. Seriously. Well, not literally

Feeling angry yet? If not, it's a plan to keep doing all the things you did when you quit. Your 5 minute breaks are still possible. You can take a breather. Only now you'll actually be breathing. Go to a quiet place on your breaks. Go away from the smokers. You can meet up with them another time, but right now, on your break, it's your time. It isn't time for those nasty little cigarettes either. Take deep breaths. Focus on the trees. Focus on the sky. Listen to the birds. Hell, listen to the cars whizzing by on the road. Focus on something else and let your mind wander. Don't even think about those piece of shit cigarettes. Think about yourself just wandering around the forest, all by yourself, for Christ's sake. We raised half a million dollars for underprivileged kids. We helped Egyptians take back their country. You're a part of something bigger. You're not the voluntary customer of a product that will physically and financially harm you

How do you feel now? Empowered? Can you take on the world? Can you kill a bear? Can you feed millions? I bet you fucking can. But guess what - you don't have to! You just have to quit smoking. And that shit is fucking easy. Millions of people have already done that shit. Smoking sucks. You know it too! Just think about how pissed off you were at those stinky little fucking pricks. You can do this. Carpe diem! Sieze the day! Then fuck it! Fuck smoking! You can do whatever the fuck you want!

Now go be a badass!

Which leads to an interesting question - Have I  stopped smoking?

The clear answer is yes. Some people in this sub would disagree. 

Why would you quit smoking? For me, damaging my lungs, and because my health was beggining to suffer - couldn't climb stairs, etc.

I've chosen to do this (and i've tried the gum, the inhaler, no chantix because it doesn't mix with my other more important medications and its an abomination that the FDA let it onto the market the way they did) with e-cigarettes, and its worked.

**So my real question -**

What is the point of this sub? Is it harm reduction (SNUS would count towards that as well

Is it total abstinence from nicotine (and apparently all drugs) as some on this sub would have it?

Is it to support people who want to do any of the above

I notice a lot of 'cold turkey' pride, you're dismissing countless valid methods of quitting combusting tobacco, an incredibly harmful habit. I've quit cold turkey, lasted about 6 months, but I never felt the need to lord what I was able to do over others. 

Which is good

I'm not going to quit nicotine. Its not my intent. Much like caffiene

She'd been sick for a while. By the time doctors found the lung cancer, while there were points it looked better, a toll was certainly taken by surgeries on her lungs, liver, brain (x2), and several others I can't remember.

It was a main motivating factor behind me (eventually) quitting -- I dropped a near pack-a-day habit about a month ago

Today, a few hours ago.

I found out about it while I was at work, upon hearing that my grandparents would have to bury their daughter, that my dad would have to speak at his own sister's funeral -- was that this would be a great excuse to bum a smoke from a co-worker.

That's fucked up guys, but then what? I'm realizing that it's not really about me.

It was never enough to quit ""for me""; I simply did not give enough of a shit. It took an aunt without any hair for me to think about quitting

I'm sure that's not the case with everyone, who the hell knows when, but it'll come, you'll look back, like my aunt had to today, and wonder what you'd get to do with all that extra time.

So you don't have a girlfriend right now -- one day you'll miss your grandkids graduate kindergarten. So you don't have a big goal right now -- one day you won't get to finish your novel. So your brother doesn't have any kids yet -- one day you'll miss your nephew's wedding.

Because you felt like smoking.

That's my motivation. If it helps you, well, at least you know why I'll never put a cigarette in my mouth for the rest of my life.

On monday i decided to quit this stupid habit. I am 26 years old and i used to smoke 1 pack a day and my method to quit was cold turkey.
One of my main reasons to stop smoking is the need to carry on with a healthy life. Smoking takes most of my apetite resulting in a really low weight. Apart from this, and that is making me remain strong about quitting. 
It's not easy though
Next monday i will start to go to the gym and i hope to psychologically realize that with time i am a non-smoker for ever.

&gt;First I'll address the feelgood factor
The physical feelgood aspect is completely foreign to a non smoker such as yourself. If you were to smoke a cigarette now in any situation in which a smoker might perceive a benefit, or feeling physical withdrawal from nicotine.  
When a smoker feels physical withdrawals, not just withdrawal-induced stress. Your brain has no such association, so a cigarette wouldn't relive any stress that you might experience. Similarly, since the rate at which is smoker's body processes nicotine causes them to want to re-administer nicotine roughly once each hour, a smoker will associate relieving restlessness with smoking, so they might smoke more when caught in traffic, waiting for class to start
The most legitimate way in which smoking might make a smoker feel good is going outside with the other smokers to socialize and get social validation or feel like part of a group that has a commonality (that unifying characteristic is addiction). This is totally unnecessary
So essentially, they only create an additional void in a smoker's life that shouldn't be there in the first place. As the only thing that can fill this void, they paradoxically solve the problem and cause it to inevitably reappear an hour later.  
Now
You're already aware of the most obvious ways in which it subtracts from a smoker's quality of life, liver, skin, and probably other organs I'm not even aware of are damaged by the smoke. Smokers will never be able to achieve the same level of physical fitness that they would if they weren't smoking.  
I'm sure you're also aware that smokers smell bad
Even beyond the physical unattractiveness, is not an attractive quality in a person. And THAT leads into the most nefarious way that nicotine affects quality of life.  
Most smokers have tried to quit
Here is where it gets personal. This is what I truly hate about smoking. I've never heard anyone else say it but I think it must not be a unique experience.  
I've told myself I was going to quit dozens of times. Every time I smoke again after promising that the last cigarette would be my final one, and energy. I make promises to myself and then break them. Sometimes I tell my girlfriend I'm quitting, and she cheers me on and supports me. Or I tell my friends that I'm quitting, hoping that if they see me succeed maybe they'll have faith that they can too.  
Then I smoke again. Sometimes I try to hide it for a while. I brush my teeth or chew gum to mask the smell. I make excuses to get away for a few minutes to get my fix. I try to distort reality so they won't know the truth. Eventually they find out or I give up pretending.  
Every time it reinforces the belief that I'm not in control
For me, worse than sabotaging my attractiveness and social status, worse than wasting my money and time, worse than any other effect. It makes me less of a man and goes against all of my values, and those are the things that give my life real value and purpose.

A lot of my good friends, plain and simple.  My brain, even now, still tells me that I need to have those little smoke sticks to live.  All this, while simultaneously telling me that I hate the leaf-tube-fire with all my might and I want nothing to do with them.  I'm calmer, and more honest since quitting.  I find that I am more cognizant of my own words, and I am constantly trying to be more honest than I have ever been in my life.  I don't run outside and crave to bury my head in a box of cancer. The rationalization was always that at least I had control of something in my life (think about that for a sec [seriously though -- I was foolish enough to believe that me having control over death was somehow relevant enough to keep smoking]).  I know many of us smoke(ed) for different reasons, by the end, but for me specifically

Of course physically, breathing is, well, amazing.  I don't feel weighed down anymore.  Do you know that feeling?  That feeling immediately after smoking your 10th cig of the day?  That one where the buzz is there, but it's not satisfying, it's just, I don't know how to put this exactly, but I would go back out and do it again 40mins to an hour later.  

80 days -- this subreddit has truly been an inspiration.  Anyone who is trying to stop your habit, but remember, it's not going to kill you, it's going to let you LIVE longer.  

Thanks for everything /r/stopsmoking.  I can't wait to reach a hundred days with you

1373388968.0,1hy0lq,From the perspective of a wife,Drassielle,57,6,5,"My husband had smoked for 20 years when I first started dating him at the age of 25. Yes, at the tender age of 45

The worst part wasn't even kissing him, while he didn't have any immediate signs of decreased lung function or health problems related to smoking, it was inevitable that I would have to watch him deteriorate in front of me just as I've watched my mother. While I did grow to love my husband very much over the first year of our relationship, this realization slowly began to gnaw at me. I didn't want to be *that girl* that gave him an ultimatum: choose me or the cigarettes. 

So I went to him like an adult and told him that I wasn't sure I could handle it, gum, petty arguments, getting down to that *last* cigarette per day, then back-peddling back up to five per day, to a pack per day, then back down to one. For some reason, he was able to do it. I'm not sure what clicked for him exactly. Maybe he realized that his 'last form of stress relief' was stressing him out more than helping him.

It's been three and a half years now since his last cigarette. I believe there was once a time he slipped and had one, nor pain in his chest, nor any other symptoms those that quit seem to exhibit. I can't tell you how much money we've saved and how happy it's made me to have someone beside me that doesn't have to leave the room literally every 5 minutes to go smoke. We can go on trips now and I don't have to deal with a cranky man who is fiending for a smoke but can't have one for another hour since we're on a plane. There are so many positive changes in our life just from the stronger half of us letting go. I am so proud of him and, while I don't know what it's like to stop smoking, I have lost over 100 lbs and have had to deal with a food addiction. It is no small feat and takes incredible willpower and strength.

I just thought I'd share with you a story with a happy ending. I wish you all a tomorrow that's smoke-free and that you continue to make the right choice. ",,t5_2rbuf,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/1hy0lq/from_the_perspective_of_a_wife/

Smoking Shit List:

-Waking up and being painfully aware of my esophagus.

-The nagging concern that wherever I go I need to have a backup plan in case I run out of cigarettes.

-Every especially good bout of laughter ending up in a fit of coughing.

-Freaking people out with a very subtle rattling wheeze every time I take a deep breath.

-The smell of my fingers when I'm trying to go to sleep.

-One less trip I have to take back into the house when I'm trying to leave because I forgot cigarettes or a lighter (now it's just the trinity of keys

-Hangovers are 80% more manageable now - it turns out that so much of the recipe for a crippling hangover is chainsmoking.  It's been amazing waking up and not regretting the sandpapery act of wrenching my eyelids open after a long night of drinking.

-Getting disproportionately angry with anyone or anything that conspired to prolong the time before my smoke break.

-Randomly having half of my hand go numb.

-Coughing so hard I give myself a headache or see spots.

I went 6 days without a cigarette. I could smell again. I could smell how awful smokers smelled. I wanted cigarettes, my e-cig battery died. My buddy, who I hadn't seen in six months, picked me up from work. He was a smoker, and I was craving. I ended up having three that day, before I got my e-cig charged, and got back on that. 

Sunday night, but I haven't had it since then. 

I had a pack of Black clove cigars

I can't get to the smoke shop to replace my cartomizer until Friday, because it was one of the only ways that I could get a break from the drudgery.

You can see from my past post it was not easy for me in the beginning.  I had lots of rough days.  But I’m pleased to say those are behind me.  Here are a few things I learned about me.  If they can help you quit

-It really is all in your mind.  Sure you’re going to be told you need “replacement” products, on a shelf where I can look at them.  I think there are 19 left.  Prolly taste like shit now…

-I live in KY-USA,300.00 this year.  How bout that shit?  I spent every last dime on shit I wanted.  Understand, not things I needed, things I wanted.  And I did it all early in the year.  This was my way of spending all my cig money on something else.  Even if I wanted to buy smokes, the money was ready spent.  And now I have a new kick ass TV and tools.  Not cotton butts and ashes. 

-Once I did quit, I’m eating better, and working out.  I feel 100000% better, and you really don’t want to smoke when you’re in that lifestyle. 

Overall I’m in a better place now, you’ve already won.  The only thing left is to go through the motions.

I'm 32 years old now. I started smoking when I was 18

So I had a cigarette. And then another later in the evening. I had one walking home from work the next day too. Pretty soon the carton was gone and I was buying packs. I'm sure you all know how this goes. My average intake stabilized somewhere in the pack a day region. It became a normal part of my life.

Seven years passed. I was 25, and managed to quit. It was great! I started riding bikes again and everything!

Almost a year later I was dating a girl who happened to smoke. It never bothered me, surely I could have just one. Hah. Yeah right.

I was back to a pack a day inside of a week. That carried on until one day I felt a persistent tickle in my throat. It got worse over the course of a few days. I started coughing. Not just the usual smokers hack. It got to the point that no amount of lozenges or cough syrup would quell it. On September 4th, threw them out, and haven't touched one since.

It took more than a grandfather

I kept riding bikes even through my relapse. But now I ride for real. I can bang off 100 miles of riding like a boss. I travel by bicycle. I ride up freakin' mountains. I love it. I hope you succeed and find something that you love as well!

Then I stopped for 3 weeks after reading Allen Carr's book. Somehow
I took it up again. I was never really addicted in the first place

But for the last month or so
Why? I have no idea.

I seriously want to quit forever. I hate that disgusting smell. I hate not being able to hug my mom because I'm hiding the fact I'm smoking from her. I hate everything about cigarettes.

All my life
Obviously

Imagine my dissapointment when I found out that cigarettes give you absolutely nothing positive. Nothing. Zinch. Nada.
Imagine me asking myself: How can one find this pleasurable?
Yet I continued to smoke. Why? I don't know. No smoker does.

Today I bought a pack...smoked one. I never got so mad in my life. I threw away the pack

I honestly think my peers don't really know what cigarettes are. A lot of them aren't aware what is actually going on and why do they need to smoke. I swear this one girl never knew what nicotine was

Me? I can't smoke anymore...I feel like an idiot when smoking. Every time I lit up a cigarette in this last month

""We are presenting you with a new drug. Millions of people around the world use it. What are the side effects? It makes you anxious, it makes you severely addicted to it, it has rat poison, azbestos and all kinds of other poisons in it.

I can understand people abusing weed, cocaine etc.
Those drugs actually do something for you. Sure

But cigarettes? No

Rare are those that resist the temptation of curiousity.

Fuck nicotine. Fuck cigarettes. They are the definition of evil.

I quit almost completely cold turkey last April, and haven't smoked since.  Here's an honest portrayal of life, post-nicotine. 

The first weeks were moderately ok. I had to take a lot of deep breaths, I get to smoke in 10 minutes... Every thing was made better by ignoring it and wishing for a cigarette. Without them, I had to really confront what I was feeling and admit that my emotional control pretty much stopped growing the day I started smoking. So on day 8, everything just stacked up and I just started crying. Told my customers it was because I got a red pepper flake in my eye, everyone chilled out after that point.  Overall, the first weeks were good because I was so excited that I was *actually living life without nicotine*. I loved calculating how many cigs I hadn't smoked, how much money I had saved. I loved most being able to come here to /stopsmoking and share my successes with others. 

The second month was where it became bloody hard to stay off them. I had injured my back and been put on steroids to help. If you don't know, or stay out west? Where do we move? What jobs can we find? Oh fuck, my parents just announced they're selling the house and moving away from my hometown. Do I want to go back to school? A billion questions, no easy answers.  I was having panic attacks about four times a week. 

It was about the third month when something really strange

I started to really live my life.  I would take walks in the morning, getting my mental shit together, and overall just enjoying the hell out of it. Observing the world around me, the feel of my feet on the pavement, how nice the sun felt; it just made me feel a thousand times better.  I started really concentrating on gardening on my little balcony, and learning how to care for something other than basil and oregano, which are pretty much zero effort. I got a mini rose, and the first bloom that opened gave me a total sense of accomplishment. I started quilting

That's what cigarettes were, my ass glued to the couch and a cigarette probably every 20 minutes.  When I would go out with friends, it was all about the conversations we could have between cigarettes, and most of our conversations were about how bad it sucked being a smoker in a smoking-banned world. Now I can enjoy learning more about my friends, and doing things like going bowling and to movies and such. 

Around November, cleaning it up, and all that. I had to move again, my gig as a Halloween store manager was over, so I had to get a new job, and a billion more questions had popped up with difficult answers. It was like my month 2, but so much worse. But I did it entirely without cigarettes. My emotions were things I acknowledged and managed, not some asshole named Phillip Morris. 

Without cigarettes chaining me to a sedentary life, I volunteer sometimes. I have a clean house, and I like it much better. Smoking tried to convince me that it was the immediate pleasure to enjoy in life, not the pleasure of the results of effort. You enjoy a cigarette while you have it, but when it's over, that's sad and you just want another. I've evolved, and now realize that the results are the important part. Sure, but I love seeing a nice clean kitchen afterwards. I may not like going to the gym

Sometimes I look around at parties when my friends are smoking. I look at those cigarettes and say ""Yea

The hardest part about quitting smoking is overcoming the lies your addiction tells you. Once you realize that you can live life without a cigarette controlling you, but the truth is you don't need luck. You just need to know you can do it.

smell of ash on my hands because I sleep with my hand like right under my head.  I would scrub and scrub and scrub and scrub to get that smell gone before bed. Not anymore.

About my smokeing history:

I am 24 years old.
I was a non smoker until i hit the age of about 18-20. Lots of things started to change in my life back then.I Just finished school, where the assaulter also hit his heart. But luckily he survived and recoverd nearly 100% and got no braindamage or something). Around that time my mother started smokeing again (she had stopped smokeing before the birth of me and my siblings). 



So with the cigarettes laying in the house all the time i started smokeing too. It increased to nearly a package (Malboro gold) over the last two years. for about half a year now i started to stop smokeing but havent really made it for a long time yet. I often throw away nearly full packages after which i find myself buying a new one 6 hours later. My record for now is about one week of being smoke free but after that i started again. So today i decided to become a real non-smoker and to not smoke any cigarette no matter what.
Wish me luck.

So now a couple of questions i hope you guys could answer for me. 

1. My mother is still smokeing and she gets very aggressive/definsive when i tell her to stop or atleast to not do it in the house. When i get her to throw her cigarettes away or when after long talks she promises me to not do it in the house atleast

2. How can i politely deal with smokeing friends who offer you cigarettes etc and who smoke indoors when non-smokers are present?

3. Are there any tips on how to deal with withdrawal and what to do when i catch my self smokeing again?

4. Since i have smoked very heavily for about 4-5 years im sure my body took a lot of damage. Are there any ""bodily signs"" which i should keep an eye on

I appreciate all the advice you guys could give a new non-smoker
Cheers

tl;dr:
Stopped smokeing
How to keep it that way 
How to deal with smokers 
Smokeing related diseases and how to treat them (escpecially the deadly ones ;)  )

I had no plan and really no intention to quit – but it was something within – perhaps the voices of my family pleading with me to stop killing myself.

After 10 years of needlessly abusing my body I quit cold turkey and it was like a black shroud was lifted from me. 

I could smell and taste again. My appearance regained its former vigor. I could lay the pipe like never before.

I apologise for being a horrible writer but even if I could support one person during the process of quitting smoking with this rant
Especialy nowadays
even in the designated smoking areas

I started smoking at about the age of 16. Not that I was pushed into doing it by peer pressure or something like that
and it's something I still regret to this day. We started doing it out of sheer boredom. Because it was fun and kind of rebellious. Little did we know the consequences.
As most of you
After 10 years of heavily smoking (about 2 packs a day) I wanted to quit. Not that I was sick or had health issues. I could afford it and it was more or less socially accepted by friends
Even after I went out for a smoke
However
They don't know how well it feels to have that smoke after dinner. How it feels to get that first hit from a cigaret you 've been waiting for for way to long
They don't know the panic you get when you see you're running out of cigarettes. The frustration when you forgot your lighter. They don't understand why you'ld stand outside in the rain for that one
smoke you were craving for the whole night. They don't understand how even going to a movie can be shitty because you can't go outside for a smoke. That countdown.
The FUUUUUUUUUUUuuuu-moments when your cigarette-package got wet because of the rain

That's probably why it bothers me there's so much hate towards smokers. This sense of moral higher grounds from non-smokers who have absolutely NO IDEA of what they're talking about.
I personally didn't get put off by the warning labels on the packages. It could've even been illegal. I needed my shot. It's funny how non-smokers keep using arguments like ""Think of all the money you could save if you quit"".
As if the price of sigarettes has anything to do with the addiction. It's NEVER a reason to quit. Would they say the same to a heroin-addict? ""Think of all the money you'll save""...

For me personally
Your life would never be as fullfilling as with cigarettes. The constant missing out on something.
The irrational thought you will never be as happy as when you are smoking. The thought of missing out on a cigarette would ruin your life. Yes
But trust me. As much as a non-smokers can't understand the need to smoke

So how did I quit?
At new years eve of 2009-2010
On my birthday in may 2011 I remembered telling I'ld quit that year but didn't care to much about it. A few days later I thought: ""What if I acutally kept my word and quit?. No substitutes
I literally went to a calender and pointed out somewhere on it blindly. I closed my eyes and ""randomly"" picked somewhere (near the end of course :)) of december when I would quit smoking. It turned out to be december 17th.
As days went on

Suddenly
My mindset at that time was completely focused on the fact that an era of my life was about to finish.
I had 1
I remembered thinking: ""This is the best sigaret I'll ever smoke
The first day was horrible ... so was the second ... and the third ... If there's anything SOMEONE SHOULD've told me about quitting
Torture. With ups and downs of course but for me there was absolutley NO improvement the first three months. 
The drawbacks were incredible. My throat didn't feel as much better as I thought it would. I got sick easily and the worst
was probably being constipated. Sounds funny? Let me tell you it's not. You probably know what I'm talking about when I say smoking is kind of a ... katalysator for taking a shit.You know
Then it need for a shit gets even worse.* That process was gone now.
All the oranges in the world couldn't help my intestines at that time. My digestive system was completely out of balance.
And in the past 2.5 years of not smoking I gained 26 kilos (57 pounds) because I compensated my urges by eating. I'm a smoke-free fatty now.

In those first three months
It sounds dramatic but I can only describe it as being taken hostage and being tortured
At work
I can honestly say
the night for that crave

Then something amazing happened. At some point I realised that a day went by without thinking of a cigarette. As unimaginable as it sounds
I would have never thought of succeeding if you'ld asked me this 5 years ago. No way. I'm not really kind of person who follows through on things. I give up rather easily and get bored real quick.
Willpower isn't my best quality so this is why I'm pretty much convinced anyone can quit smoking. I don't see it as having willpower. It's more about how much (mental and physical) pain you can bare.
Even though there is only a small difference between the two.

I don't want to put anybody off
Was it worth the trouble? ABSOLUTELY!
Do I sometimes still feel like having a cigarette? ABSOLUTELY!
Probably once a month
Wouldn't you sign for that?

Based on my experience
I'm not saying this will be suitable for anyone
 
- Pick a date (even a year from now if you want) when you're going to quit. You will look forwards to this day. STICK TO THIS DATE. There is no such thing as being ready for it. You never are
- Tell people you are going to quit. It sounds weird but that social pressure was sometimes what kept me going.
- Cheating is bad mmmmkay. Don't take substitutes like nicotine gum/electric sigarets
- Do not avoid social gatherings
- Do not throw away your cigarettes at least the first month. Keep them where you usually would. The comfort of actually having them with me was an immense help! I had no extra stress of needing to find one if I actually decided to give up.
  It might sound contradictive
- Congratulate yourself. Every minute
- It might sound silly. But if you think of giving up
- There is no shame in feeling weak! Don't feel guilty about it. It's a huge part of the process.
- A great motivator for me was actually imagining what would happen if I relapsed. Imagining that first hit. Feeling incredible for a second... shortly followed by shame. Embrace that thought of shame.
- Know that deep down, especially to yourself?

You CAN do this.

1) I still get little tinges of cravings, stewing it over with a cigarette. People understand when you're acting stressed *in a stressful situation* -- it's a normal reaction.

2) I have switched my food munching with jogging. I initially replaced smoking with food

3) After nine years of smoking cigarettes, ""I'd like to do that someday."" Now I make plans to actually do it and know that when I put my mind and willpower to something, I actually come through.

4) I can go into bars that allow smoking and realize how much I *do not want* to smoke. It doesn't trigger me at all. It smells awful. I don't ever want to smell like that ever again. I always have to immediately come home and throw clothes in the washer. I never thought I'd get to this point.

5) This summer hasn't been that hot for me

6) I like to sing and

7) I was at a dinner gathering with a bunch of friends and a smoke break occurred. An attractive acquaintance and I were left behind (in the air conditioning

8) Smoking is no longer cool. I've noticed more and more of my friends setting quit dates or declaring their want to quit.

9) My nails aren't yellow anymore! Along with smoking, I see a huge difference in my nail bed! I'm not a nervous wreck anymore.

10) I've saved over $1000 so far

Bonus) **I feel healthier.** I smell better. I look better. I work better. I socialize better. I don't have to worry about me ""tasting like an ashtray"" if someone kisses me. I feel better about my future and my life.

oh jeez guys, I gained weight, hated those around me, but slowly and surely I thought I was done with them forever. I started training for a marathon and didn't ever look twice at cigarettes, felt bad for smokers I saw on the street, could get totally drunk and not care.
 But theeeen, but didn't stop. Then came a trip over to Belgium to visit a friend I hadn't seen in awhile. He would always smoke my cigarettes when we were drunk and lo and behold, once we got wasted, we bought a pack. Smoked them all night and then we had some left over the next day I had a couple while sober. Got home - reset my badge - felt shame. 
Still, 24 days after resetting my badge AGAIN, i smoked while drunk. regretted it the next day. This all leads to today. I feel pretty down and depressed, I am in love with a boy who doesn't love me as much as I want him too, school is annoying me, and I feel fat even though I'm pretty healthy, running a lot. 
Anyways, put it out and now I'm writing this. I wanted that cigarette to make me feel better, sexier, confident, happy, and for some reason I felt like it would. I'm a damn fool, cigarettes don't solve anything and they honestly don't taste good. anyways

**UPDATE:** I have released the 2nd installment of my NUSU Guide to Quitting Smoking. It can be found [HERE](http://redd.it/169hre). Enjoy!

**First installment of my Nut Up or Shut Up Guide to Quitting Smoking written by yours truly.**

I figured since everyone in here is doing the right thing by quitting, journey. First and foremost let me start off by saying that I am a former smoker (I think a bit over 3 years at this point) so I know the pain of quitting. I was a smoker for over 10 years so I know this is a nightmare to go through. However everything you're experiencing, although terrible I know, serves a purpose and it’s important to empower yourself with this knowledge because it will make the quitting process easier. This isn't a time-line guide by any means, because in my opinion we all go through these things but each of us experiences it at different times. This is more of a psychological guide of what to expect so when it happens you won't lose your shit and light up another smoke. 

**Part I - FML the first days are the worst!**

So you've decided to quit, for a loved one, to save money, or maybe you were just sick of coughing up blood and black stuff (Yup, been there). Either way, you've made a great choice. Consciously you feel awesome, but physically you probably just took a dump in your stomach because you just realized you've committed to something that you haven't prepared yourself for....withdrawals. Here's what you should expect for the first couple days:

1. Anger - Why not? Don't you usually smoke when you're irritated? The kind of anger you feel is probably similar to a 5 year old angry at his mom because she won't buy him the toy in the store; you're angry but you know it's irrational.

2. Sickness - I know, sweats, the shakes, etc. It's all normal; just drink a lot of water. 

3. Sadness/Depression - You feel like crying doesn’t you? I know. Go ahead, I knew it was! I LOVED smoking. I felt like I was never going to enjoy life to the fullest again. Good news though, life actually is better later on. But for now, go ahead and let it out.

4. Restlessness - Ok, meditate, pray, go on a walk. Just figure out anything that helps you burn off the energy. 

**My Part I secret weapon? EXERCISE!!!** Seriously, you can still do light exercise (i.e. crunches, walk around the block, jumping jacks, etc).

**Part II - No
So, medically a lot of good stuff has happened (I don't know all the details), but do you give a shit? Of course not! You're hating life to the fullest right now because this is the longest vacation you've taken from them since who knows how long. On the flip side, here are some things you'll probably notice during the next couple weeks:

1.	You're going to have more energy - Waking up will be easier

2.	You're going to smell/taste better - Kind of a double edge sword. You may gain a few pounds. But if you're working out like I recommended you won’t' notice as much but food will taste and smell AWESOME!

3.	Less frequent anger - Yeah

4.	Depression/Sadness starts to decrease - You've started to accept the fact that you're life isn't over, they'll understand. Start distracting yourself during your downtime (Reddit was a great time killer).

**My Part II secret weapon? Replaced coffee with GATORADE**. This was huge because caffeine is a HUGE trigger for cigarette cravings. I found new places to go during my lunch breaks and other downtimes. Separated myself from other smokers. 

I'll release a Part III &amp; IV but I first want to get feedback on this guide before proceeding. Hope this helps

Yesterday was hell. On day two now, water, and a jog. As well as re-reading every comment here. Honestly, you guys rock - I hadn't expected to make such a splash. I feel like I can't let you guys down now! Thank you a thousand times over.

1335814342.0,t07ie,I've been a non-smoker for 1 week. No regrets and no chance of going back!,madetopost1comment,49,3,13,"So I realize that a week is not a lifetime, slowly

* First, but that's really important to me, so I added that as a 3rd step/rule/statement. I can quit smoking because I'm in control.

* I've kept a journal of my smoking related thoughts and experiences for the last week. In the past

* Acting healthier. I've run more in the past week and I'm eating better. I feel like I can't smoke again because that would go against the type of lifestyle I'm leading. If I was eating Big Macs and drinking like I used to in college

* I've been slowly easing myself into smoking situations. I had brunch with a friend who smokes and rode in his car while he smoked. I also went to a bar where you could smoke and had 3 or 4 beers with a different (non-smoking friend). Alcohol is a big trigger for me

* Constantly reminding myself that I'm a non-smoker and (I know this sounds bad) I'm better than smokers. When one of them walks in to my office I hold my head a little higher because I know I've done something that they can't. I'm not going to lie, who smokes, named Jesse. I don't think of Clint Eastwood. I have to constantly remind myself that smokers are gross, smelly, not sexy, assholes, and lack the drive to quit. I really don't care if I'm stereotyping. I need something in my head as powerful as 27 years of pro-cigarette marketing to counter-balance it.
