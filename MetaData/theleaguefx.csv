As the title says. Request gifs. I use photoshop to make gifs so they are high quality. 

Request format:

* Season: 
* Episode:
* Describe scene:
* What you want in the gif: 
* Size:
* Speed:    
    
    
If you don't know which season or episode then just give your best description. 

I'll do my best to make it exactly how you want. 

I prefer to only do clips from the show

I'll do them ASAP. If asking for a gif please reply either to one of my comments or directly to the thread so I can get a notification. 

All gifs will have a small ""reddit.com/r/theleaguefx"" watermark along the bottom. It will hopefully help out the subreddit. 

If you want a gif from the most recent episode wait until 2 hours AFTER it airs on the West Coast of the United States please. I don't want spoilers as notifications. I usually watch it before it even airs on the west coast but just to be safe. If you ignore this I will not make your gif and I will call you an asshole. 

Please check through the comments to see if your request is already fulfilled. 

Just so everyone knows
    
Here is a link to the full album of all gifs I have made! I will upload the gifs to there so when you see it it will be up to date always!

1375060018.0,1j8wnu,My thesis on The League,TheBeardedSeer,16,2,5,"Preface: So I decided to start watching this show two days ago after someone told a League joke and I didn't get it. I began watching and am currently about to finish the 3rd season. Throughout this wonderful binging

Pete's Demise:
So the pilot introduces many important aspects of the show: we are introduced to many of the main characters, etc. The first thing we learn, however, is that Pete is the man at Fantasy Football; he's the first to speak in the pilot, he has won the league three times, he clearly is good at the game. We also see that he divorced his wife mid-episode. Now, as a cinephile, but I ignored it and continued to watch the show. But then

We can all agree that there are six main characters in the show, Dre, Ruxin, Taco, and Jenny. So the first group we're going to talk about is Ruxin and Kevin and their character's versus Pete. Kevin is Pete's bestfriend and Jenny's husband as well as his daughter's father. Kevin is perceived in the show as this innocent do-gooder who has a stable job, a loving family, and a best friend. Pete loves Kevin, a really (really) hot wife, therefore

Now the second set of characters: Taco and Dre. After Pete's divorce, you have Dre who is a successful plastic surgeon, but also easily the most singled out individual in the group. Although he has a lot of money, Dre is picked on the most out of everybody for his strange fashion sense in behavior. The reason is because Pete really is more self conscious about being on Dre's level than he is on Taco's. Pete knows that he's a better person than Taco, but Dre is  touchy subject. So in order to bring himself above Dre, he perceives Dre as  this sad little man who is singled out as the weirdo by all the League. 

Now back to Pete. The reason why I believe that this is Pete's perception of his life after his divorce is because we don't really know too much about him. We hardly see anyone picking on him
But i was wrong. The story all comes together with the League. The episodes span from the beginning of the league to the end; in other words, the show starts up, just like Pete's life. Pete sees the League as the only thing that will bring him reason and the only thing that will bring his friends and him together, and thus the only thing keeping him together.",,False,self,False,t3_1j8wnu

i fucking love this show. i think it's one of the best on tv right now

i know absolutely nothing about american football. or sports in general. i know a bit about basketball, i didn't follow NBA. barely knew names, knew nothing about stats.

sorry for the preamble. my question is: how much more would i enjoy the show if i loved sports and american football (i've never watched a game in my life and know absolutely nothing about the rules. do you have to pass the ball behind like in rugby? i know nothing about rugby either but i know that because we'd play with a football when we were kids it involved that one rule and then just beat the hell out of anybody in front of you until you ran the ball through the goal or you lost the ball) and followed the NFL and knew the names of the players and their stats and what have you?

i mean obviously i know i'd enjoy it more if i was immersed in the subject matter,,False,self,t5_2sws5,False,,True

Be as specific as possible with your guess too.

Sound interesting? Want to talk shit to a coworker? Need a really cheap way to propose marriage that involves sports

1323332099.0,n4mb8,"So, would anyone like to hear the story of how Steve Rannazzisi lost his virginity and some other interesting info? ",BenHuge,6,3,http://www.reddit.com/r/theleaguefx/comments/n4mb8/so_would_anyone_like_to_hear_the_story_of_how/

First,  but anyway. Onto his v-card.

I'm going to do my best to do this story justice and remember as much as I can. I might be adding edits if things come to me later. Trust me though

So he was 15 when he lost it. He grew up on Long Island and there was a girl he had been messing around with for awhile. He lived nearby

So he and Debbie are getting pretty hot and heavy, his mannerisms and voice are nearly identical to his character.)

One other thing I forgot to mention was Debbie was a twin. She has a twin brother that was about 6'3"" and a star athlete. Steve was on some team or had a class with him or something and it was sorta talked about that he liked his sister and she liked him back. The brother's response was, just be cool."" And this conversation took place a few days before the event was to happen so Steve took that as, ""Yeah, you can date my sister"" and not ""Yeah, you can pound away at my sister like the inexperienced loser you are."" But he decided to go for it anyways.

So the plan was hatched. Directly across the street from Debbie and her twin brother, but he was with John. John and Bruce were friends. So Steve had John have Bruce over to spend the night this one specific Friday. At the same time, he told his parents that he was spending the night at John's house, but he was REALLY going to stay at Debbie's. His mom dropped him off at John's and then he snuck over to Debbie's.

Now there are two parts of the story here that get important. First, but when it was bedtime your ass had to be in your fucking bed just so she could open the door and peek in on you to make sure you weren't dead.

The second was that Debbie's dad was a paraplegic and was confined to the second floor of the house. Well

So Steve sneaks over, what are we watching TV for? And they start to go at it. They're hooking up for a little bit, clothes start to come off, pretty soon they are naked and Steve is in position.

He radios the tower and instead of getting a ""Negative Ghostrider"" he gets the green light! He slides it in and everything is going rather well. She turned out to be one of the girls that didn't bleed or feel much pain so it was actually enjoyable somewhat for both.

Steve is just pumping away, huge, athletic Bruce. Crying his eyes out like a little girl.

Steve hears this, fuck. He just saw my white bare ass pumping away in his twin sister and it brought him to tears.

ACTUALLY

Within seconds Bruce sees what is happening and starts screaming and yelling bloody murder. Paraplegic Dad upstairs is rousted and starts making his way down to the first floor.

## Chaos. 

Steve is grabbing his pants and trying to put them on. Brother is yelling and crying. Paraplegic Dad is yelling from upstairs and trying to come down. Steve says he is going to leave. Bruce yells and says no

Debbie calms Paraplegic Dad down by telling him that Bruce was just upset and he has already left. He goes back to bed.

So

Well

### SEVEN FUCKING TIMES!!!!

Steve lost his virginity

Immediately after the seventh time every cell in his body is just SPENT of all energy and he instantly falls into a DEEP DEEP sleep.

Suddenly, next to him on the couch, crying her fucking eyes out.

She said all he wanted from her was sex. He tried to explain that they just fucked seven times and it can really take it out of a guy. She was having none of it.

She broke up with him right there. He picked up his pants. Put them on



...buuuut that's not quite the end. It's now 1 AM and he has nowhere to sleep. He can't go to John's. Bruce is there. He can't go home. He's supposed to be at John's. His (ex)girlfriend just kicked him out of the place he was supposed to sleep and he's 15

So

He then proceeded to run to John's driveway RIGHT at 8 so he could hop in his mom's car before Bruce came out yelling about what the hell was going on.

The End.

I'm pretty sure it was Gremlins.",self,t5_2sws5,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/theleaguefx/comments/n4mb8/so_would_anyone_like_to_hear_the_story_of_how/
