A few days ago
Ulcers can be caused by a calcium deficiency, acidity plays a huge role in causing them as well…

As I kept reading
Take a Tums tablet

This might seem like a grand-mother recipe, and a good night sleep, the ulcer that normally would take DAYS to heal is no longer painful, and much less inflamed, and on its way to a very speedy recovery.

Whenever it is you have to wake up most days. Wake up at that time EVERY DAY. NO EXCEPTIONS. If you have to wake up at 5:30 to get to work five days a week. You wake up at 5:30 weekends and holidays to. If you're a student you have to get up at 7:00 to make it to classes. Set your alarm for 7:00 every day.   

As soon as the alarm goes off. Get out of bed, but eventually your body gets used to this and you get moving much quicker.   

On holidays and weekends when you don't have to be out the door as early

1) Your body is still in the mode of waking up early every day
2) Your brain is super awake and you dream a lot. Very

Obviously if you have an early flight to catch or you have an earlier event

Edit:  
From [learn2fall](http://www.reddit.com/user/learn2fall) 

&gt;The actual reason this works is because bringing your chin to your chest 'closes' the part of your throat which is dedicated to breathing(larynx) and 'opens' the part for swallowing (esophagus).

What you need:

* A can of sweetened condensed milk

* pot of boiling water

1. Peel off the label
2. Get the water to a boil
2. Submerge the can in water (i put it on the side so it could roll and get even heat)
4. Make sure the water covers the can totally
5. leave at a very low boil for 3-4 hours and **make sure to top off the water** so its covering the whole can
6. take the can out and leave it to cool for a few hours

now you have an amazing caramel spread - i tried it on bread already and i was in heaven

***Pro Version***

instead of cooking it in the can you can use a jelly/marmalade jar or a mason jar

just fill the jar with condensed milk and screw the lid on

again leave to boil and check up on it

after 3-4 hours before cooling off

***with a ribbon around it it makes for a good cheap Christmas present***

This might be more of a tip than a lifehack - but let me know and ill see if i can find another sub to share it on :)

A common font and font size standard used by teachers is Times New Roman size 12. It would be obvious if you changed that. So here's what you do:

Find the ""search and replace"" tool in word/staroffice/whatever you use. Search for all dots and commas and replaces them with a new dot/comma in size 14. It's not noticable to the eye

* Stage 1: Learn the correct pronunciation of the language.  Doing this does a few things –  because I’m first and foremost learning how to hear that language’s sounds, for example, are much easier to remember when there’s a connection between the spelling and the sound), and once I finally start speaking to native speakers, they don't switch to English for me or dumb down their language, which is awesome sauce.  If you're learning a language with a different alphabet, this is where you learn the phonetic alphabet(s) (Kana, for example)

 



* Stage 2: Vocabulary and grammar acquisition (itself in a few stages)
I start with a frequency list and mark off any words I can portray with pictures alone (basic nouns and verbs).  I put those in an [Anki deck](http://www.towerofbabelfish.com/Tower_of_Babelfish/Anki.html) and learn them.  Once I have some words to play with, I eventually move to monolingual dictionaries and writing my own definitions for more abstract words (again doublechecked at lang-8.com).  This builds on itself; the more vocab and grammar you get, the more vocab and grammar concepts you can describe in the target language.  Eventually you can cover all the words in a 2000 word frequency list as a foundation and add any specific vocab you need for your own interests.





* Stage 3: Listening
Once I have a decent vocabulary and familiarity with grammar, and talking (mostly to myself) about the stuff I see and do.  Every writing correction gets added to the Anki deck, which continues to build my vocab and grammar.





* Stage 4: Speech
At the point where I can more or less talk (haltingly, which is adapting to holes in your grammar or vocabulary by going around them rapidly and automatically without having to think about it).  I prefer Middlebury college, but a few weeks in the target country will work as well if you're very vigorous with sticking to the target language and not switching to English.  If you're extremely strict with yourself, your brain adapts pretty quickly and learns how to put all the info you learned in stages 1-3 together quickly enough to turn into fluent speech.

As a new &amp; used car salesman, and some of my fellow salesman may get a little upset by this post:

Keep in mind

Your needs:
Understand what you are looking for in a vehicle, coupes, mini-vans, and trucks. Everyone has different needs and wants. For instance, most people want leather, but can settle with cloth. Even though navigation is a nice feature, you can easily get a GPS for $100.00. Everyone has different needs and wants. Please make sure you know what you need compared to what you want. 

Utilize the internet:
Shop around online. By doing this, but they may also include incentives and rebates you may not qualify for. Not everyone is a recent college grad, or active duty military. Please read the fine print. 
If you are looking for a specific new vehicle, which may or may not have that vehicle in stock. You do not have to settle. 
When you have decided on a new vehicle

Know your credit score:
This is a major issue. I understand bad things happen to good people, the better your interest rate will be for obvious reasons. If you have credit issues, please bring a co-signer that has a decent credit score, and a decent amount of income-to-debt ration. 
If you are unsure of your credit, that will let you know what your credit score is.

Trade-in:
If you are still financing a vehicle you plan to trade-in, and ask for a ""10 Day Payoff"". Then utilize websites such as Autotrader.com , to see roughly what your vehicle is worth. I use the term ""roughly"", due to the fact that your vehicle may be worth more. 
Before you utilize a website like autotrader, other wise the number that is produced will be unrealistic. Look at your possible trade-in, and pretend that you are buying it from yourself. Annotate any damage, (nicks, scratches, dents, dings, the dealership will find them

Going to the dealership:
It is best to set-up an appointment. If you are unsure what salesman to work with, you can pick your own salesman.
Keep in mind you are in control, or walk away at anytime. I will let you know, that your salesman, has scripts, like an actor. We have rehearsed these lines, and we have had training on them. 

If you have followed the previous steps, and go over those key features to try to impress you. This is called the ""Wow factor"". 
Feel free to test drive the vehicle. This is usually a 10 minute ordeal. If you need more time

After the test drive
The salesman would most likely do some paperwork. If you have already done your research, let him/her proceed. This is where everything comes together. You can explain that you have already received the matrix pricing. This cuts negotiation, of the vehicle. If you have negative equity, that will be added to your new loan. This means if you were looking at a $10,000 vehicle, and have $5,000 negative equity,000. When you see your interest rate, try to negotiate, you can have it included. **You can negotiate these prices**. 
The dealership may bring out a ""closer""

If you are within your budget after all this is said and done, you can tell the dealership that you will not buy today, but tomorrow. Never lose control. 

Finance:
When you speak to the finance manager, as well as gap insurance. You can easily negotiate these terms. It is best to negotiate these with the finance manager, due to the fact that there is no longer a ""middle-man""

 



Also:
Statistically, that is not going to be your co-signer, be careful of what they say. It can ruin your deal. If they have concerns, they can voice them to you, just ask the salesman to leave for a minute. 

I hope this helps all of you. The reason for this post, than your enemy. I would rather make a little bit of money off of you ($100), and you refer your friends and family, and I can do the same for them. Word of mouth travels faster than any advertising I could ever do. 
 
With that said, (vehicles). The more I sell, (regardless of gross profit) the better my paycheck is. Also, I am located in Virginia, if you want more information PM me, and I will answer all questions you may have. Please be kind to me, since I have given you the full insight to my job.

Most people don't know you can often go one

Start by going to somewhere on Google Maps

Zoom in as far as it will let you by clicking on the ""+"" sign at the top of the magnification slider at the top left of the map.

When you're in as far as you can go (heh) but not all the way to street view (if the location you're looking at even has street view)

Click on the chain ""link"" button. That will show you a box with a long URL to the map you are looking at and another box with some HTML code to embed. Ignore the HTML code.

Copy the long URL and paste it into your browser's address bar

Change the 22 to 23 (""&amp;z=23"") (or 21 to 22...basically just add 1 to whatever you see) and hit enter. If Google Maps has imagery at that higher zoom level

This can be fun in cities -- they have some really high-resolution shots sometimes that they don't show you by default.

Here's what you get with the above location -- a zoom level that you can't get to normally by using Google's +/- slider: http://goo.gl/maps/Bk9uh",,t5_2qj5n,1365800132.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/lifehacks/comments/1c8b9m/how_to_zoom_farther_than_google_maps_will_let_you/

There were about ten of them chilling on the nest last night, and now my front steps look like the aftermath of some kind of crazy epic wasp battle.

My classes are usually early so that I can go home and fall back asleep without worrying about the rest of the day but all of the singing and random bursts of noise from all around the house usually wakes me up and makes me a bit grumpy.

I recently tried using earplugs - foam and silicone - but I've heard there could be long term issues from relying on them too often.. plus they don't work all that great.

I know there are some products you can buy to noise-proof doors (and it really seems like all of the sounds leak from around there) but they're pricey and some require a setup that involves drilling into the door. I'm living here for less than a year now so I don't feel comfortable doing that.

1. The works. Had this at home. Tried it last Friday and it didn't work at all. 
2. Kaboom. Picked this up and sprayed it on. Leaving it overnight. I'll go back tomorrow to see if it helped at all. 


UPDATE- So the toilet is still nasty but mostly due to OP's incompetence. I plugged up the toilet and poured in coke but then had a really long weekend and wasn't back for a few days. The coke had all drained out (not sure how long it actually was in the bowl) and the crap was still cemented on. Turns out my plug for the toilet is pretty non-functional and I can't figure out another way to plug it. the drainage hole at the bottom is long and oval rather than round. Still working on it.

* http://www.clearbits.net/
* http://www.publicdomaintorrents.net/

**Open directories**

Open directories are simply unprotected folders that have been left open to the public (be it intentionally or accidentally). Huge pots of files can be found all across the web full of pictures, porn, whatever. Once you find an open directory, you can either click on the wanted files one by one to download or grab them all at once using wget (available on all platforms, tutorial [here](http://www.regravity.com/documents/Wget%20%96%20A%20Noob%92s%20guide%20-%20Regravity.com.pdf)). /r/opendirectories is an awesome reddit to subscribe to, and the community will be a good place to ask detailed questions or get help with wget.

To search for files in open directories

You want pages containing ""index of"" in the title. You do not want HTML pages, or ""php"". Put the type of files you want to end up with in quotes (for example, ""mp3"" or ""epub""). You end up with a search looking like [this](http://www.google.com/#hl=en&amp;output=search&amp;sclient=psy-ab&amp;q=queen+news+of+the+world+%22.mp3%22+-inurl%3Ahtm+-inurl%3Ahtml+-inurl%3Aphp+intitle%3A%22Index+of%22+-site%3Awallywashis.name).

If you want to use wget

    wget -e robots=off -r --no-parent -c --limit-rate=150k [url here

remove --limit-rate=150k or change the number if you like

**File-hosting sites**

[Filestube](http://www.filestube.com/) searches [Mediafire](http://www.mediafire.com/), and other sites (see the [advanced search](http://www.filestube.com/advanced_search.html) option for a full list). I've found filestube to be far superior to its rivals, which tend to only search a few of the big sites.

BTW, you can effortly switch between the two. But honestly with the benefitis of Colemak I never type QWERTY really.

Edit: Some advantages:

Ergonomic and comfortable – Your fingers on QWERTY move 2.2x more than on Colemak. QWERTY has 16x more same hand row jumping than Colemak. There are 35x more words you can type using only the home row on Colemak.

Easy to learn – Allows easy transition from QWERTY. Only 2 keys move between hands. Many common shortcuts (including Ctrl+Z/X/C/V) remain the same. Typing lessons available.

*Short:*      
1st: Put all your stuff in 1 folder     
2nd: Create 1 .exe to open your hidden folder with a password     
3rd: Create 1 .bat/.exe to close your folder after you're done      

What it **does** with screenshots: [Click]( http://imgur.com/a/vzMCM)      

____________________________________________________     

Step1:     
 Create a bat file containing:
&gt;@echo off    
&gt;cd /d d:\NSFW\Downloads2    
&gt;set/p password=    
&gt;if %password% == custompassword goto next     
&gt;exit     
&gt;:next     
&gt;attrib -h +r +s /s /d     
&gt;explorer d:\NSFW\downloads2     

Step2:
 Create a second bat file containing and put it in your secret folder     
&gt;@echo off    
&gt;cd /d d:\NSFW\Downloads2    
&gt;attrib +h +r +s /s /d    
&gt;taskkill /f /im explorer.exe    
&gt;explorer.exe    
&gt;exit   

Step3!:
 Convert your .bat file to an .exe file so your password is safe.
 Do this by downloading a small compiler; (1st link in google or for the lazy: [Cnet.com](http://download.cnet.com/Bat-To-Exe-Converter/3000-2069_4-10555897.html) )
