It is IMPORTANT that you not resort to insults or negative stuff

MAKE SURE to express how you are no longer thinking of purchasing their products or a Wii-U if they only care about promoting their new products and want to extinguish loyal fans who love their past works.

Please help contribute to this emergency rally so we can get Melee back on stream(even if not streamed by EVO
Please upvote this to keep it visible until EVO happens this weekend.

Thanks to your feedback we will be moving forward with some additional changes to the subreddit. Let's cut to the chase:

* **Link Flair has been enabled.** There is no longer a need to put tags such as [Melee], click the ""flair"" button under the text box and manually apply the appropriate label. If you feel any important labels are missing, let me know.

* **MEMES are officially banned from /r/smashbros.** I have created a new subreddit called /r/smashmemes where pretty much anything goes as long as it isn't completely and obviously irrelevant or inappropriate. ""Memes"" include [image macros](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_macro), [in-game snapshots](http://www.reddit.com/r/smashbros/comments/15foar/if_bowser_wins_in_the_2p_slot_sometimes_his_face/), [animated gifs](http://i.imgur.com/xhAw3Wv.gif), [community highlights](http://www.reddit.com/r/smashbros/comments/16n216/mew2king_has_the_best_reaction_after_beating/), news in the form of pictures (such as website updates), and otherwise [GENUINELY unique/funny/interesting content](http://i.imgur.com/HyeWHDc.png) will still be allowed on the main subreddit. Use good judgment!

* **/r/smashmemes** has been created for those of you who want this sort of content. Yes

* The flair icon for **Lucas** is now functional, and Wii Fit Trainer.** (thanks to /u/Ike_Lawliet)


* **There is a pending ban on Brawl vs. Melee (vs. 64) posts.** I say it is pending because we will be creating a FAQ for it. When the FAQ is written

* **SSB4 wishlist types of posts are now banned.** Instead


/r/smashbros is also looking to better take advantage of the reddit wiki system. Articles that I'd like to have include but are not limited to:

* Beginner's guide to competitive Smash / general /r/smashbros FAQ
* How do I find local players/tournaments? FAQ
* Past AMAs
* Project M FAQ
* Melee / 64 online play guide
* Melee vs. Brawl

Obviously

James Chen has been doing this seriously for years and you were every bit as competent as he was, never letting the commentary get stale

I tuned into the Marvel stream by accident and some of the commentators had found your Smash notebook left at the desk, etc). I had no idea you put that much work into your commentary, and it was great to see the culmination of your efforts displayed so well in the Top 8, when we had over 120,000 people watching.

* As /u/Probable_Foreigner mentioned a few times

I'm gonna keep the bot running, like something we have seen before, feel free to not upvote it. But the bot will be there when they show the tail of Mewtwo by mistake ([Remember how we discovered Lucario ;\)](http://bulbanews.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Lucario_confirmed_for_Super_Smash_Bros._Brawl) ).

I'm gonna try to improve the bot by grabbing the bigger pictures from the website and posting them to imgur for archive.

1371150820.0,1gac46,[ModPost] Welcome to /r/smashbros! Let's discuss the state of the subreddit.,Elbedhar,164,11,81,"**Please upvote this for visibility**

Hey

That said, and various other types of submissions that I'll simply refer to as ""reddit nonsense."" The moderating team is committed to maintaining /r/smashbros as a top-quality subreddit for both casual and tournament players alike, and in order to facilitate this we've introduced some new submission rules. Here are the highlights:

* **Images of text are disallowed.** Similarly

* **Do not post duplicate submissions.** We will be seeing frequent updates from the official website

* **Please remember to tag your submissions.** ~~We are going to be streamlining this by making the tags more compact. From now on, [B], [PM], and [SSB4]. Until there's more of a clear distinction between the 3DS and Wii U iterations of Smash 4, we'll use the same tag for both. Of course, tags are not necessary for general submissions. For submissions pertaining to more than one game, use combined tags such as [B/M] or simply [All].~~ I've just added proper ""Link Flair"" to the subreddit. Please use this! More info to come in a post tomorrow.

/u/el-prog has been added to the moderating team to help us enforce these new rules. Additionally

* **Disallowing Brawl vs. Melee posts.** This debate has been done to death and we think that an objective wiki FAQ page can substitute. Anyone want to take a stab at making this? Let me know.

* **Disallowing ""I want to see X make it into Smash 4!"" types of posts.** We get it

* **Disallowing meme / funny image posts.** Memes used to be pretty uncommon around here and they provided a good occasional laugh. Now we're seeing multiple villager meme posts per day and they are detracting from the quality of the subreddit.


Again


Lastly, who is apparently missing), but unfortunately there are some glitches we're trying to work around. Please bear with us - the flair icons will be available soon.


Thanks guys

First and foremost, that everyone who expresses interest in playing any of the Smash Brothers games at a competitive level, should definitely pursue  that. There's a reason many of us have dedicated years and years of our lives to it, and I'm sure you'll see that same dedication very soon!

Anyway

**Pre-First Tournament**

So before you become the next Mango or Armada, here a few things that I think most people would consider to be VERY important!

1) At almost any tournament you ever go to, that's something you should definitely invest in. You can usually pick them up for less than $20 at Goodwill, or whatever thrift store is close to you.

2) The only really quality controller on the market is the original first party gamecube controller. I know your MadCatz™ controller has a super sick turbo button

Now that we've got those things out of the way

3) Find a scene near you! There is a facebook page for every region of smash! No matter where you are. In the sidebar of this subreddit there is a list of every regional facebook group. Go join the one appropriate to you, rivalries) that we have developed over the years. This is an insanely close community, and a pleasure to be a part of!

4) Pick a character! If you haven't already

5) Know what to expect! Watch youtube videos, everything you can do to know what to expect when you show up. More than likely, there's going to be a couple really high level players in your area. Learn who they are. It's going to be important to watch their matches, and learn how they play. 

6) Practice, I mean A LOT. Like, a literal disgusting amount. When you think it's time to take a break, play for another hour. You want to be the best right?! Well, put in the work!

**Your First Tournament**

You're here now. This is it. Time to show everyone how all that awesome training is coming along! Hell

1) You're going to get bodied. I'm sorry. I have so much faith in you

2) It doesn't suck! Ask them what's going on! Most people are going to be more than happy to give you tips, it's so very important that you take your loses with a grain of salt, and try to improve! 

3) Stay for the whole tournament! I've seen a few times that new players will show up, and so hype, I can't imagine ever leaving early! Watch late bracket, and be amazed at how good these players are! Watch what they're doing, and how they're handling themselves in pressure situations. It's possible (and likely, if you stick with it!) that that's going to be you someday, so pay attention!

4) If at all possible, but if you see a recording setup, and it doesn't seemed to be used, just ask! It'll be important later, I promise.

5) The most important thing. HAVE FUN! Of course you're here to compete, play friendlies (when it's allowed!), go get dinner with new people you just met! I can't stress enough how the best part about melee is the tight-knit community. 

**Post-First Tournament**

Well, but that's okay! You had a blast, made some new friends, and are ready to get better and go back with some new tricks. Now what can you do to prepare for the NEXT tournament, now that you know what's up?

1) Remember those questions that you asked? Ya, and try to play a more grounded game? Do it. I know it's tempting to jump, but these are habits you've gotta break early! 

2) Hopefully you can get some matches recorded/uploaded, think about them a lot. Try to just get rid of one bad aspect of your play at a time. Melee is a game of winning a lot of small battles with yourself, over a long period of time. 

3) Keep practicing! Like I said before. The best way to improve is to play a lot! So don't stop!

**Other Stuff!**

Remember, or to just talk to someone, if you ever feel discouraged, or like quitting!

Thanks for taking the time to read this

1375553732.0,1jmxs0,All you need to know about input lag (in preparation for SSB4),JerFlip,106,12,41,"Since [this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/smashbros/comments/1jmmf6/will_playing_on_an_hd_tv_with_smash_4_have_the/) has some misinformation in it
    
    
## Intro  
*****    
    
The Wii U is an HD console. This means the competitive SSB4 scene will be migrating toward HD monitors
    

**Q:** *What is input lag? How will it affect SSB4?*  
  
**A:** Input lag is the delay between a button press and the intended action happening on screen. Most of us have experienced it at some point while gaming at a friend's house; you fire up a FPS/platformer/rhythm game
    
Input lag is why games like Guitar Hero and Rock Band have calibration tools for HDTVs. Since these games are timing-sensitive, so fighting game enthusiasts play on PC monitors that have low input lag (more on that later).    
    
All HDTVs and HD monitors have input lag. The level of input lag varies depending on the make and model of the display. Some PC monitors have less than a frame (16ms) of lag
    
Generally speaking, and more than 32ms is disruptive to a gaming experience.    
    
**Q:** *I've played on a lot of HDTVs and none of them had input lag. Are you sure you're not full of shit?*  
  
**A:** Some gamers are more sensitive to lag than others. You simply didn't notice it
    
    
**Q:** *How can I test whether my TV is laggy using only my Wii U?*  
  
**A:** Follow the guidelines [here.](http://www.nintendolife.com/forums/wii-u/use_the_gamepad_to_test_your_hdtv_lag)    
    
    
In short, my monitor is actually quicker to display visuals than my Wii U gamepad.    
    
    
## Monitors with low input lag  
*****        
    
    
There are a few databases for monitors and TVs with low input lag.    
    
[Shoryuken's Sub 1 frame HDTV/monitor input lag database](http://forums.shoryuken.com/discussion/145141/sub-1-frame-hdtv-monitor-input-lag-database) (a few years old
    
[displaylag.com](http://www.displaylag.com/) (the most up-to-date database
    
The monitors used by Evo and MLG (the Asus VH236H and the BenQ GL2450HM, the Eizo Foris FS2333, which costs around $500).    
    
If you're looking to enter tournaments in the future
    
    
## Other questions  
*****        
    
    
**Q:** *Can I still use a CRT for SBB4?*  
  
**A:** Yes, so while you may have minimal input lag, you won't get to appreciate the game's nice graphics. Also, your friends will probably hate you.    
    
**Q:** *My TV has a game mode. Will this eliminate input lag?*  
  
**A:** Not really. Game mode disables some post-processing effects that cause input lag
    
**Q:** *I play Smash casually. Will I have to buy a new TV?*  
  
**A:** Probably not. This mostly affects those who plan to enter competitive SSB4 tournaments. Most casual gamers have nothing to worry about.    
    
**Q:** *I have an HD CRT display. Will this have input lag?*  
  
**A:** Probably. HD CRT TVs use a lot of post-processing effects to heighten the image quality.    
    
**Q:** *Almost all the monitors I see on Newegg and Amazon have 2ms or 5ms response time. What's up with that?*  
  
**A:** [Response time has nothing to do with input lag.](http://forums.shoryuken.com/discussion/55593/the-new-definitive-hdtv-lag-faq)    
    
**Q:** *Can I play SNES/N64/GameCube/Wii games on a monitor with low input lag?*  
  
**A:** Using an HDTV or HD monitor with these consoles will add significant input lag. This is because the consoles' native resolution is standard definition
    
    
  
  
And that's it. If you have questions, not just with SSB4.

**TL:DR**

**EVO was a blast to watch, how much we need to get Sakurai and Nintendo's attention to influence Smash 4. We know after EVO, we have the numbers to make a difference, we know the gaming industry listens if the outcry is loud enough, and we know reddit has done awesome things before, so let's make a difference!**


Also


[This link has everything you would need to contact Nintendo.](http://www.reddit.com/r/smashbros/comments/1iavgm/make_sure_you_let_nintendo_know_how_happy_you/) I already did my part.

Here's my story, I've played smash since the N64 version, I'm pretty good for a casual, but I can't hang with the competitive scene. I know because I've played with some of them. When Brawl came out, I played it, and I enjoyed it, and I like it more than melee, mostly because of my dislike of the attitude of the competitive players, and I was always thinking

After watching EVO, I could tell what was going on, what mechanics were being used, and just how hard it was to get to the level the people being knocked out in the first few rounds were at. The nuances of M2K, Armada, and Mango were visible.  Also EVO was EXCITING. I like watching pro basketball, and in my mind, with the grab, and do a flashy dunk. They both had the initial huge jolt of excitement

I'll follow up these comparisons by saying that I neither have any desire to become a pro smash player or a pro basketball player, but they are both part of what makes each game exciting. The same goes for wave-dashing, canceling, teching, etc. After EVO, I watched a few games of competitive Brawl because I thought it would be better, but instead, I realized what Sakurai did to Brawl is what would happen if the commissioner of the NBA made all pro basketball players wear socks and no shoes when they were playing on hardcourt. It would be slowed down

Now this has made me realize that I enjoy watching melee with the extreme high level of play, but now they have another chance. But they think they have to choose. As you guys have been saying, they don't realize they don't have to choose between the two player groups. But I know, and we all know that the game needs advanced techniques. Just like in basketball, you have casuals everywhere who can't dunk, can't shoot a corner 3 pointer 50% of the time, but they can still dick around and play horse, etc. with the same ball and hoop, just because of the way the game already is. But if you have advanced mechanics in there

We need to make Sakurai realize this. We need to be loud. We have already been trying

EVO has brought something new to the table though. It has hopefully made Nintendo realize that people do want to watch competitive smash, but we should also ask for leaderboards, patches to fix unbalances in characters, really, really good online play (if it's possible) and an easy way to stream smash games a bit like LoL.  I think that these five things would make SSB4 into an enormous community and build upon the amazing base of a community that melee has given us (Personally I think with these things that we could get up to a fraction the size of the LoL community if Nintendo does this for us).

If we want the dream of smash being a huge competitive community that is enjoyable to be a part of and to watch by both competitves and casuals

.

P.S. 

If you think this post is inspiring, SSB4 still needs to add characters and stages to keep the casuals, including me, happy (that's all it takes) but I didn't want to put that anywhere in there because it broke the flow.  Thanks for reading!",All,False,self,1373943024.0,t3_1iddev

1372010772.0,1gx32n,[MELEE] - A competitive player's guide to Pichu,Garbagehead4,105,20,14,"Yes

And yes, and his primary recovery (up-b) *does 4% damage every time you use it.* The list goes on and on and on. That said, many people choose to play him as a troll character, myself included. At first, I didn't take Pichu seriously at all. I won only a handful of matches, but the sense of sheer satisfaction I got when beating another player as Pichu was incredible. I suddenly wanted to prove to the world that Pichu can exceed everyone's expectations and promptly shit on the tier list.

For the last few months, you too can destroy your opponents with ""the worst character"".

Let's get started.

**GENERAL CHARACTER NOTES**

* For the love of God

* As mentioned before, especially since up-b and neutral b should be used often. Wherever possible, avoid using moves such as dair, fair, and down-b. Dair and fair can easily be replaced with nair in most situations (more about nair in the 'strategies' section).

* Pichu's attack range for ground based attacks is *terrible*. Ftilt is a complete joke in terms of range. You want to stay off the ground whenever possible

* Pichu suffers from high knockback. Learn the basics of DI and Crouch Canceling to keep you alive.

* Despite his many shortcomings

* You *must* learn to space properly with Pichu. Rushing into battle spamming nair may be a valiant effort

* Pichu's grab game is good

* Use Pichu's speed and size to your advantage. Once your opponent is in the air, but won't set you up for combos as well as uair. 

**STRATEGIES**

1) The Pichu Beatchu combo: This is Pichu's go-to killing move. Learn to use it depending on the type of character your opponent has and their percentage. Vary it up with a nair if your opponent is at a low percent. This combo is amazingly effective against spacies

* Standard PB combo for medium weight characters:    Grab -&gt; dthrow -&gt; upsmash

* PB combo for spacies/fastfallers at low percent:    Grab -&gt; uthrow -&gt; upsmash

* PB combo for spacies/fastfallers at high percent:    Grab -&gt; dthrow -&gt; upsmash

* For floaty characters

2) Nair/Uair combos: best done on stages with low platforms, and it is tough to describe in detail because there are so many different contexts. Utilt is also a good move that will chain combos, especially if your opponent is above you but too close to do a uair. Bair comes in handy to mix these up as well.

3) Neutral b pressure and edgeguarding: Neutral b is Pichu's only projectile

4) Recovery: As stated before

5) Dtilt spacing: Pichu's longest-ranged ground move is dtilt. Ideally

6) Fsmash KOing: Fsmash very powerful attack with godawful range

7) Moves which you should rarely or never use: fair, side b, down b (on FD in particular), downsmash (can be useful but *very* hard to hit properly).

8) Watch this video and study it

9) SHFFLed Nairs: Just do it.

**STAGES**

* Yoshi's Story: This stage is a double-edged sword for Pichu, however, are what will get Pichu killed more easily. Despite this problem, I've had the most success playing on Yoshi's Story.

* Fountain of Dreams: Almost as good as Yoshi's Story, making this stage a viable option. 

* Pokemon Stadium: Pichu's home turf is actually a good option for the annoying rodent. The changing platforms allow for many combos. 

* Battlefield: The platforms here are slightly higher up than the other stages I listed

* Final Destination: No platforms severely hinder Pichu's combo game. Be ready to bust out a TON of grabs and a TON of neutral-b's. PB combo works well here, more so than elsewhere. 

* Dreamland: For the love of God, but here he is forced to kill horizontally. Good luck.

**CONCLUSION**

So there you have it. A simple guide to Pichu. Some may see this character as a joke, feel free to add more tips in the comments!",,False,self,t5_2qiep,1372011570.0,pichumelee,

This is the proper way to tag your posts. **DO NOT** manually put indicators such as [Melee] in your submission titles (modposts are the exception :p).

1376374562.0,1k9h5f,The Official Peachball Rulebook,soozafone,88,8,16,"Okay

A few days back there was a [thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/smashbros/comments/1k0hcu/what_games_do_you_like_to_play_inside_any_smash/) here about the little games we play within Smash, and I was bored enough, that I decided to make this post explaining the rules in detail. So here you go:

^^^^.


###THE OFFICIAL PEACHBALL RULEBOOK

*Peachball is an exciting new game mode in Super Smash Bros. Brawl in which two competitors attempt to smack an unconscious Princess Peach into the opposing player's goal.*

^^^^.

**I. THE PEACHBALL ARENA**

[Figure 1: The arena](http://i.imgur.com/H0qG7Rp.jpg)

The Peachball arena is a custom stage in Smash Bros. Brawl, such that characters will not spawn outside of the field of play.

The name of the custom level housing the arena is at the discretion of the builder

^^^^.

**II. PREPARATIONS FOR PLAY**

Begin preparation by selecting Special Brawl and turning on Stamina Mode. No other Special Mode modifications are necessary. The two human-controlled competitors should each set their HP to 300. The competitors may select any character they like, select the Peachball arena from the custom stage list to begin the match.

^^^^.

**III. GAMEPLAY**

When the match begins

To officially begin Peachballing, with the object of propelling her into the opponent's goal while defending their own.

*Competitors may also attack each other, and KOing the opposing player results in automatic disqualification and a victory for the KO'd player.

A goal is considered valid if a player knocks Peach into the opposing player's goal and she (Peach) touches any surface (ceiling, even if she then bounces out. A goal is also valid if the attacking player knocks Peach into the goal and the defending player lands an attack on Peach that fails to prevent her from subsequently touching the ceiling, wall, or floor of the goal area. 

Knocking Peach into one's own goal (""own-goaling""), he or she is permitted to use any attack to launch Peach out of the goal area, but may not exit the goal area for five seconds after the launching attack.

After a valid goal is scored

In standard Peachball rules

^^^^.

**GAMEPLAY VARIATIONS**

* Experienced Peachballers may want to increase or decrease the score limit for added challenge

* Items may be turned on for the match. Since most items will spawn outside the play area, or a high-risk explosives match.

* Final Smashes may also be brought into play. In this case

* Other modifications can be made to the arena; consider adding ice blocks, though, that Peach still cannot be knocked out of the field of play.

* Consider turning on other settings in special mode.

* An impartial third party may join the match

* Very little research has been conducted regarding the use of a different character than Peach for the ""ball."" Try Bowserball

^^^^.

**FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS**

* *Why Peach?*

The mechanics of Peachball were first discovered during a casual stamina match during which a CPU-controlled Princess Peach was KO'd and her body later unintentionally catapulted across the stage. Things went downhill from there.

* *What characters make the best Peachballers?*

Pikachu makes an excellent defender as his down-B lightning strike will still hit thanks to the arena's high ceilings and will arrest the momentum of an incoming Peach anywhere along a vertical line. King Dedede's dash attack will give a resting Peach enough air to pop right into the goal from a few blocks out. Charizard has powerful attacks with enough mobility

* *I think [rule] is unfair/the arena should have [x]*

We the esteemed progenitors of the great sport of Peachball have spent quite a lot of time dialing in the arena specs and the gameplay rules

* *Was this rulebook really necessary?*

Nope!

* *Do you regret spending three hours writing it?*

Nope!

^^^^.

Prog here.  So

Basically

1.  Melee It On Me (A Melee centric podcast to talk about things that are going on in the community

2.  Handwarmers that were excruciating in length.

Out of number two came the idea that eventually came to be the University of Smash initiative.  Basically, or as a more educated and involved viewer.

From the get go, I invited King Funk (for Smash 64) and Mike Haze (for SSBB) to see what we're developing.  And I've given notice to a couple of P:M paragons that they are more than welcome to create their own content as well, and we'll host it.

So

1.  YouTube:  Advanced How To Play/Apply.  A pair of videos being scripted by Strong Bad and Armada with Lucien, myself and others.  The older how to play is missing a few things that are across the whole cast, so we want to update it.  In addition, we want to talk theory, what's the use of learning every advanced technique if you don't think about or have a plan for when to do them?

2.  Youtube:  Tutorials.  We're looking at some specific tutorials, teching, pivoting, tech chasing may all have different tutorials as well to go further in depth than our previous videos).

3.  Twitch.TV:  How to Play (Abridged Version).  The YouTube version may end up being an hour

4.  Twitch.TV:  Various filler.  We may have character notes, etc.  This material should be between :20-:40 seconds in length.

Everything is still in production, other obligations have taken priority.  We will have a dropbox for any streamer who wants to access these files (as well as host trailers for upcoming series/regionals, etc. in the scenes, provided TOs send them to us so we can upload it).

That being said, as streamers, so on and so forth?  Be as generic or specific as you'd like.

Although everything is empty at this point

For those who didn't see the original, ultimately, with the help of /u/not_bad_69 the text was figured out!

So, many of who were new to him. Following that, what was tweeted, and the answer text, this was probably drawn for him in their studio as nice way to welcome him in. Notice that Kirby and Pit are two of the most prominent characters- Kirby, who was created in part by Sakurai, and Pit, also, Legend of Zelda

As for the solving of the text, I separated the ""bumps"" into columns as either individual letters of possible double-tiered letters (things like H, M, V, etc.) Then, based on the bump curvature, the width, I [gridded out](http://i.imgur.com/WDV9V.jpg) all possible letters in their respective columns. The magic is when not_bad_69 noticed that there is a 3 bumped letter, and using remaining possible letters

The gallery also includes the original tweeted image to show what the base was

Also make sure to bring setups and your own controller! The tournament won’t progress very well if they’re short on setups. But if you can’t bring a TV

Gambling is banned at the venue and by extension that includes money matches. Keep them low key or in hotel rooms

Don't mess up this opportunity by being stupid! Be on your best behavior

Basically: use common sense!

First time going to EVO? Want to keep track of your matches/pools? Download and install the EVO Mobile Guidebook App to your Android or Phone: http://guidebook.com/g/evolution/

If you can’t use the guidebook

Speaking of those at home

And here are the individual links to each stream:

http://twitch.tv/srkevo1
http://twitch.tv/srkevo2
http://twitch.tv/srkevo3

If you want to watch all three

You can only chat in those streams if you’re subbed to them, but you will be watching at a lower quality and won't have access to the archives for anything you may miss overnight.

But wait!! There’s more! www.twitch.tv/vgbootcamp will be streaming some of Day 1 Melee pools! So be sure to follow them as soon as you can so you can be notified when they’re online. Keep in mind that they are an unofficial streamer for the event so VGBC cannot run ads. Their connection will also not be very top notch so they might go down a few times while streaming (just a warning so you aren't mad when it happens!) If you want to support them at all


Not only that but www.twitch.tv/CLASHTournaments will be streaming during the after hours of EVO on both Friday and Saturday nights in a hotel room to bring you the matches that might not happen in bracket. With so many players attending this year’s EVO tournament (696!!) not everyone will be able to play each other. So follow their channel to make sure you’re notified when they’re live

And of course there will be streams throughout the week from other Smashers such as www.twitch.tv/pbnj23 and more! If there are any other Smashers streaming from hotel rooms they will be posted when they’re live.

This is basically everything. Are you ready for EVO 2013? You better be! It's only a few days away!

I wanted to share a project I am currently organising, Super Smash Bros Melee and Super Smash Bros Brawl. The album will offer a diverse range of musical genres and talent and will be available to download next year.

I have previously organised two Metroid albums called Harmony of a Hunter and Harmony of a Hunter: 101% Run. The first was released to mark the 25th Anniversary of the Metroid franchise, while retaining the fans we had already made.

Our team involves a wide range of talent with a passion and love for Smash Bros. We hope Harmony of Heroes is a project that fans of the franchise will love and appreciate.

Be sure to check out the links below for more information on Harmony of Heroes. If anyone would like to get in touch to help me promote this further

**THIS ISN'T GOING TO BE ANY EASIER ANYWHERE ELSE

BEFORE WE BEGIN **I'm going to assume you already have the Homebrew channel installed on your Wii**, if you still have trouble, message me), in order to FULLY set up your wii for any kind of hacks, you may need a specific SD card, but you can still install Homebrew with an SD card that is above 2GB. The Homebrew channel is basically all you NEED (For things im going to teach you, like installin Project M, The Classic Expansion Pack
A LOT of people are going to tell you a 2GB card is essential but it **IS NOT**!!! if you use GeckoOS on Homebrew, etc...

* First of all

* Just right click your SD card on you computer and click ""**format**""

* So once you do that

THEY'RE UP FOR DOWNLOAD PUBLICLY ON GOOGLE DOCS

They're in a zip file so just unzip it and put the contents on your SD card. [**CLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD THEM**](https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B4_3ItSbnvk4bFJQTDRsbDM1X2M/edit?usp=sharing)

So once you have those *3 essential folders*

I have set up 4 download links

**THE FOLLOWING DOWNLOAD LINKS HAVE FOLDERS THAT GO IN THE ""brawlmods"" folder** (**remember to unzip them first**)

* [THIS ONE](https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B4_3ItSbnvk4aldhaHRnSUVqM3c/edit?usp=sharing) (579 MB) has Project M

* [THIS ONE](https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B4_3ItSbnvk4VGxfSDM2c0RoNWM/edit?usp=sharing) (348 MB) has Brawl-, but it IS NOT the official brawl plus hacks set, i dont really find that one all that great)

* [THIS ONE](https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B4_3ItSbnvk4blRoZXF3c2pzWGs/edit?usp=sharing) (165 MB) has Basic Brawl with TEXTURE HACKS that i find to be really well done or just fun to play as.

* [THIS ONE]( https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B4_3ItSbnvk4RWpJOG9mUHNVYXM/edit?usp=sharing) (806 MB) has the music folder that has alternate songs


**REMEMBER** ANY OF THE MODS YOU DOWNLOADED JUST NOW GO IN THE ""**brawlmods**"" folder

So now once you're done

1. Start up your Wii 

2. Go to the Homebrew channel

3. Launch  the ""Riivolution channel"" (**YOU SHOULD HAVE YOUR SD CARD IN THE WII BEFORE YOU START RIIVOLUTION**

4. **PRESS INSTALL** (It just makes things easier)! then it gives you the option to choose which hack set you want

5. MAKE SURE EVERYTHING IS **TURNED ON** BEFORE YOU LAUNCH THE GAME

**NOW YOU HAVE A FUNCTIONAL RIIVOLUTION CHANNEL


JUST A FEW QUICK NOTES!!! 

* THE CLASSIC EXPANSION PACK (CEP) is basically a pack that adds stages to brawl from all the different smash games

* The individual CEP is different from the one one that was built for Project M because the songs are in different places. So when you play Project M with the CEP
SO in order to fix that


* If you downloaded the textures

I **don't** have a list like that one for the music yet :( sorry

* There are 2 versions of the **RSBE01.gct** in the ""**projectm**"" folder, rename the **RSBE01.gct** to **RSBE01(Legendary Pokemon).gct** or whatever you need to to remember, and the other one **RSBE01.gct** (The one titled ""**RSBE01.gct**"" is the one that WILL be put into effect, if it has any other name, it wont be implemented)

* **Brawlcustommusic.com** is a VERY good website to get music from, the list of song code-names [CAN BE FOUND HERE](http://forums.kc-mm.com/index.php?topic=26697.0) 

* If you want to change the names of songs as they appear in game when a match starts follow [**THIS TUTORIAL**](http://www.smashboards.com/threads/step-by-step-guide-with-pics-on-how-to-edit-music-titles-using-brawlbox-updated.255990/) If you downloaded my music pack and want a copy of the mu_menumain.pac and info.pac that has the replaced song names i currently have

* FINAL NOTE! In the second mod download link that has basic brawl with basic codes (infinite jumps, etc.) the RSBE01.gct is in the wrong place (my bad) just move it from ""**brawlmods/brawlplus**"" to the ""**brawlmods**"" folder so when you start up riivolution you can just select ""brawl w/ codes"" when you're picking the hack/mod set you want to use.

* If you have any questions regarding how to delete/add/move certain textures, we're here to help :)

1350593110.0,11pjus,A competitive player's opinion on Brawl vs Melee (included: reasoning),xroflmaowtfx,95,24,60,"Whenever I see anti-Brawl posts from people I've never heard of, so I wanted to make this post as a more educated argument on why Brawl isn't as ""good"" of a game as Melee is.


I'll clear the air right now and say this: I think Brawl requires skill. It clearly requires skill because there's a competitive scene with relatively consistent results. Tripping is a slap in the face to competitive players, but I'm saying that it's not the MAIN REASON that Brawl isn't as enjoyable as Melee.


The biggest thing that makes Brawl ""worse"" (or more-disliked) than Melee is just.... it's not a very exciting game.


I'll start with combos and punishment. The hitstun in Brawl is super low, there's still depth involved because you have to constantly be jocking for hits and jocking for position, but LET'S KEEP IT REAL. We're playing a COMPETITIVE VIDEO GAME. We want flashy, cool, and exciting shit to happen now and again. If we wanted it to be about positioning the WHOLE way through, we could just play a board game or something. 64 is on the complete opposite end of the spectrum in terms of combos. The combos in that game are kinda overpowered since hitstun is SUPER high and because there's no DI aside from smash DI. Well, if the combos are so strong, but they have a LOT of options to try to mess up your combos (DI


Now


One side of the coin: aggression. Brawl (and 64, defense puts you in the passenger seat, which isn't really good) at a high level (unless you're Isai in 64), and that's because it is an incredibly smooth game where you have a lot of mobility and room to do ANYTHING. Like... Melee's freedom and variability in control allows you to be really deep and really creative with how you maneuver and outplay your opponent. Brawl doesn't have the same type of movement, and therefore, it doesn't allow for creative, aggressive play the same way that Melee does. Like, whenever you dash forward in Brawl, wavedash back, there's no dashdancing


Now for the opposite end of the spectrum: defense. Defensive options are, shielding, spotdodging, and rolling are all a lot stronger in Brawl. Spotdodging and rolling have a lot less lag, so they're harder to punish therefore, a bit more spammable (not 100% spammable, obviously). Shield stun is a lot lower in Brawl, dropping your shield is REALLY fast in Brawl, being in shield is a bit more limited than not being in shield

There's a LOTTTT more to say on the matter,False,self,t5_2qiep,1350620687.0,,marthmelee,t3_11pjus

So much stuff was stolen at APEX because the tournament was very poorly organized, in this case to hire (or at least ensure) proper security.

Of course it's a tragedy that so much valuable equipment was stolen. What makes me upset, but let me summarize: Alex Strife is a greedy, immature person who treats his underpaid staff like shit and is evidently incapable of running such a large-scale tournament. This is all shoved under a facade of cries for sympathy and exaggerated claims such as ""I went through hell"" and ""I take the shirt off my back to help people"".

This comment may come as a shock to many. However, mostly because they are tightly knit with the community/tournament scene and cannot afford the risk of community backlash. I understand that I am being pretty blunt and mean, but as someone who has been personally affiliated with Alex Strife and some of his staff, I hope people find at least some merit in what I've explained. Go ahead and tear me to shreds, but I (and a pocket-sized portion of the community) silently await the day we see a new large-scale tournament organizer on the east coast.

Besides the fact that IT'S EVO!!! and that we raised so much money to be at this point

1) It is BY FAR the biggest Melee tournament in history.  Expect final attendance to be near double the previous record.

2) ClashTournaments will be hosting Salty Suite--an unofficial, such as HMW.  Here's the link for that if it's news to you http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qStm6t6nwsc

2.5) Ken returning with even more practice than before.  Also

3) Legendary Falcon players Hax, Darkrain, and SS are all attending.  As far as I know, there have been no sets between Hax and S2J or between Darkrain and S2J.

4) JMan and Shiz are both confirmed.  After being totally rusty and still having an impressive performance at Zenith

5) Armada potentially returning

6) Hype matches that have never happened.  The Falcon matches from 3).  Ice/Android vs many players (don't sleep on Armada's brother Android

7) Great story lines of all kinds.  Below are the ones that I thought of off the top of my head

Mango looked on fire at Zenith, will his dominance continue?  Will SS BEAT HIM AGAIN ?!?!? (lol).  Hax has been solid all year, will he be able to not only defeat other contenders like Axe and Shiz, but finally break through into the top 4?  PewPewU is finally atop the NorCal power ranking, will he and his bff SFAT be able to step it up at nationals, or will Shroomed continue to outplace the rest of his region, despite his lackluster year in NorCal.  Westballz and S2J are eternally hyped by WC, coming off a great performance at KoC2, it was in PAL,self

1.  What is EVO?

Evo

2.  What does this have to do with Smash Bros?

Smash is returning to EVO.  Melee was there in 2007 with Ken winning, PC Chris in 4th.  Brawl was there in 2008 with CPU winning, Ken taking 2nd, Hall in 3rd and SK92 in 4th (However, they weren't using the tournament standard rules).  Melee will be there for the first time in 6 years, and already has shattered attendance records for a singles only event.

3.  When and where is it?

EVO is held at the Paris Hotel in Las Vegas

4.  Can I register?

Yes!  Until the 30th of June

4.  Can I spectate?

Yep

5.  Can I register as a player?  

Yes, you won't be allowed access to the main ballroom on Sunday during top 8, you'll be in a secondary hall.  

6.  Will there be doubles?

Probably not.  Two days of pools has already been confirmed

7.  I'm going

Mr. Wizard has requested televisions/gamecubes:
http://smashboards.com/threads/tvs-and-gamecubes.336265/page-2#post-15511900

8.  What can I expect?  

Hype.  It doesn't matter what game you play, Ken being there to give up (or defend) the throne, Armada's retirement leaving the title of best in the world back up for grabs, the largest event in Smash history (numbers wise), etc.  

9.  I can't make it.

No worries.  VGBootcamp will be streaming Melee action, ClashTournaments is doing a salty unsanctioned smash suite.  So, some of your favorites will be playing and some of your favorite commentators (including HMW) will have no holds barred.",,False,self,t5_2qiep,,http://www.reddit.com/r/smashbros/comments/1g2mro/meleeevo_info_dump/

* Captain Falcon Carries a gun in a holster

* One of Pichu's outfits is a pair of goggles. In Brawl

* The special video in Melee briefly shows a few matches on a beta version of Temple. There are large platforms shown that don't exist in the final game.

The development of Smash Bros. is unfortunately taking it's toll on Sakurai. We need to encourage him with some positive feedback to him and the team themselves.

If you have twitter/Facebook hashtag it with #YouCanDoItSakurai

If you have a Miiverse account go to the Official Smash Bros. Community website and draw it up with the hashtag. We need REDDIT's positive energy and INFLUENCE THE DECISION MAKING WITHIN SAKURAI AND EVENTUALLY MAKE A GREAT SMASH BROS. GAME. SUPPORT THIS CAUSE.

It's fucking pissing me off. 

I remember watching Melee it on Me and I don't remember if it was Cl0ckwerk or someone else but scar asked him why there was a stigma against Melee being considered in the FGC and why people didn't consider it a serious competitive fighting game. His answer was along the lines of ""I think smash is a competitive game and since it's a serious fighting game people do consider part of the FGC."" But the simple truth is that it isn't. People shit all over smash because of misconceptions and simply being ignorant. I'm even surprised how considerate he was being when he gave his answer, but he was talking on behalf of the 2D fighter community, and a lot of them are obnoxiously vocal about smash).

And it's not like we look at other fighting games and act like they're not good enough because they're not smash or they're not fighting games or competitive because they don't have shields or platforms or prominent air to air combat. When did we base the entire 2D fighter genre by it's weakest gameplay aspects (ie mashfest)?

This doesn't have to do with Skullgirls. This doesn't have to do with SF2T. This is just my way of destressing through means of public rant. Sorry for taking your time.

* Check out this moveset I created for XYZ!
* Wouldn't XYZ be an awesome feature to have in SSB4?

We are happy to have new comers whether you are already a competive smasher or your just starting out and want to learn or just continue to play casually. We have a good mix of all those players and a majority of them are very kind and welcoming. However I have one request. After seing much of this in the past few days. If you are new to this subreddit and you come in and attempt to bash and tell us how competitve play is stupid not worth it or nerdy. You are probably in the wrong subreddit. Regardless of how good or bad a player you are this is not a place for trash talking or the putting down of other players. You are entitled to your opinion but if that opinion is all competitve play is stupid
 
 
edit: This goes for competetive players to who rag on someone just for liking brawl. 
 
edit 2: Yea this goes for the competitve players beating up on the new guys to. Its very very rare I see it happen but with an influx of new people to the sub reddit weird things happen.

1361490996.0,18zk4p,Why ban items? -An old school Melee player's perspective-,olipei9008,56,9,70,"This was from a dude named Trekiros on the comments from IGN's annoucement about Melee rules @ EVO

It's a well thought out comment that I think anyone


""I'm going to reply on the oldest comment mentioning items

1) Their spawning location is random. We would not have banned them if this wasn't the case.

2) Their spawning timing is random. We would not have banned them if it wasn't the case.
Note : we haven't banned Peach

3) Some items (actually, no matter what your character is. Thus, it removes creativity, diversity, and lowers the learning curve. We banned these very early, they have never really been used in tournaments.

4) Some items have random outcomes, about 1 year and a half after the release of the game.

5) After we banned random outcome items and overpowered items, thus resulting in all items being banned.

6) As we discovered the more obscure mechanics of the game, and Move Staleness, items were just not even an interesting mechanic for competitive play, no competitive plaer ever tried to have them back ever after. Google or youtube these four things if you're motivated, it'll make the show at EVO much more enjoyable for you, for you'll be able to understand most of what's happening.

Here's an extreme case study of an item match : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7EFx0-Zkn54

Now, as this example shows. As soon as money is on the line, we are not willing to put our entry fee to the test of luck. We only want our skill to decide what placement we'll get.

As it turns out, multiply it by ten thousands, and you'll get an idea of how experienced each one of us is with items.

Kind regards

I'm the maker of the shirt- firstly, if not perhaps all of the Marth and Falco products feature a severe misprint, in which the graphic is quite a bit smaller than it should be. A misprinted shirt looks [like this,](http://i.imgur.com/7y3gb8Y.jpg) while a correct shirt should have [these proportions.](http://i.imgur.com/CWjdH0m.jpg)) It is not clear yet whether some shirts or perhaps the entire Marth and Falco line feature these errors. Irrelevant of whether this happened multiple times or not, I'm extremely sorry.

**To those with shirts with errors, when they open to remedy this.** If you can, please include a picture of the shirt (can be from a phone, etc.) as proof to show TeeSpring. You will absolutely get, at least, a full refund. I really, *really* appreciate your support, and unfortunately the same process that can create excellent quality shirts (screen printing) can also create errors

**Again, absolutely feel free to PM me, message us on FB, or ask on Tumblr, and I will do my best to fix the issue as quick as possible.** Although normally there is a only a small minority of shirts with defects, the vast majority of the shirts are printed perfectly. 

This is really a personal endeavor for me- while CT is now endorsed by Clash Tournaments, and I also love design. Bringing those two things together makes me happy- there's nothing like stumbling upon a group picture from a tournament where someone is wearing one of my shirts. :) When errors like the above happen, it is both unlucky and sad- nothing would have made me happier than for my design to have made someone else happy. I'm very sorry that didn't happen, and I hope CT hasn't lost you as a customer.

*EDIT: I also want to give credit where it's due- my amazing girlfriend has helped enormously with input, Mark Korsak, of Clash Tournaments, has been an enormous help, professionally.*

*EDIT 2:* ***If you want to help:*** *If you received a misprint, but to express that we actually wanted these shirts- hopefully, by showing enough support, they will do a reprint, so that everyone can receive not just refunds but also proper shirts to be proud of.*",,False,t5_2qiep,True

Basically, and it will be answered!
Perhaps you have a small question but didn't think it warranted an entire topic? Post it here! However

An example of a question might be:

&gt;What is the difference between NTSC Falco and PAL Falco?

To which the answer would be:

* Falco's [PAL] down aerial only spikes for the first half of the animation. The rest sends the opponent slightly up.
* Fox can tech out of Falco's down throw in PAL.

https://www.dropbox.com/s/uoloa7j6l5can3z/Kyletheguy%27s%20Project%20M.zip

It's super easy to install (same as the regular hackless version of [Project M](http://projectmgame.com/en/download)). Just follow the instructions on the included readme and you'll be set.

Of course

Please let me know in the comments if you find any glitches or have any questions. Happy smashing!


Edit: A lot of you guys want to see some screenshots before you try this out and I totally get that. I wouldn't want to blindly download something like this either. I don't have time to put any together tonight
Edit Edit: ...or I could just use the snapshot function that's built into the game to get amazing quality shots. That works too :p

Also, but right now I need to go to work. 


LAST EDIT: Well, so I hope that everyone that got a chance to download it has fun. Otherwise, I'm sorry if I got anyone's hopes up. If I can find another way to upload the file, I'll make another post and share it again (I'll be sure to add pics next time).

The connection here is made by two very strong and obvious data points. This is because Olimar 1) was released right on the Japanese Pikmin 3 release

Edit:Villager was also revealed within a week of his game being released in the U.S, which is why he wasn't included in the original post.

I think that in the coming months we can expect to see the reveal of several other characters to promote their games that are coming out. People are saying that Yoshi not having been revealed yet is fishy. Did you know that he has a game coming out [soon](http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_ss_i_3_7?url=search-alias%3Daps&amp;field-keywords=yoshi's%20new%20island&amp;sprefix=yoshi's%2Caps%2C208)? He'll probably be confirmed around the release date of his game to promote that. Other characters that make sense to be revealed soon are Puff(more likely) or Mewtwo/Newtwo(less likely) for the worldwide release of X and Y in October; Zelda or maybe even Toon Link (I know it's unlikely

 This still leaves Captain Falcon and Ness

TL;DR
Nintendo is using it's strongest franchise to add a little hype to its game's releases.

Start a game.

Since the Captain Falcon shirt campaign reached its goal

The shirts will run for much longer than before, I expect other characters to sell less. Because of this, the campaign goals are lower, and the price is higher by just $1. I hope this will not be too much of a change. 

I plan to have several designs going at once, so there'll be plenty for everyone! As always, thank you all so much for your support. It's been really amazing getting the chance to do something I love for the community I spend my time in! Here's to a great EVO!

---

##The Past

Started off innocently enough with just a Facebook poll.  There many games listed there

I'm not too sure how it took off.  Some smashers shared the link around saying stuff like ""hey, I had no idea what was going to come next.

Someone made a smashboards post about it.  It EXPLODED.  A giant organized effort came from smashers sharing the link every which way asking all of their smasher friends to vote for it until Melee was not only in 1st place, which includes easily recognizable games such as SF4 and UMVC3 (though obviously, they didn't even need to be in the poll to be in EVO lol).

The poll never guaranteed entry into EVO though.  Perhaps with how overwhelming the community response was to the poll though, he also announced that an *eighth* game would also be chosen: the one who donated the most to a breast cancer reasearch donation fund.

In the early days of the donation fund

However, support for it drastically waned.

Melee started taking off

It became a back-and-forth struggle, and more to garner as much money as possible, and both communities planned decisive snipes at the very last moments of the donation drive.

Close to the end of the donation drive, establishing themselves as a potentially threatening new rival!  Though it later turns out that was all they could really muster.

The night of the donation drive was probably the most tense.  Melee had a stream podcast called *Melee it on Me* where they organized one last effort to crush the donation drive.  Skullgirls had their own stream where the developer and the voice-actors themselves were getting involved in organizing community effort.  On that day

From my personal experience watching it

Didn't have to wait long for the explosion to really happen.  Somewhat losing hope, I shit myself and spent the rest of the minutes leading up the end of the donation drive screaming, whooping, and hollering for joy.

It was a great day for Melee that day.  A great day for anyone who loves Smash

---

##The Present

In just one week leading up to EVO

This outraged countless people.  For Smashers

Competitive smashers were not the only ones who saw injustice in this decision.  Countless others

In a matter of *hours*

---

##The Future

EVO is upon us.  For all those going to compete in the bracket

For those streaming not-top-8

For the stream-watchers

CRT TVs only output at one refresh rate and are interlaced. 480i. That's interlaced. This means you are, it is very hard to find gamecube component cables, but if you have one, you're in luck. If not, you have to use your Wii with component connection.

To achieve a lagless 60fps 480p display, but we know the terrible lag they can have.

The solution actually comes from old CRT computer monitors. They will display at 480p with no upscaling needed. There is a factor of converting the component YPbPr to RGBHV. Any other conversion will resort in a DAC which will incur latency. This is basically converting Component RCA to VGA DSub. If you are handy with a soldering icon

But I will say this

GameCube Component to RGBHV :

1365264042.0,1bstj3,An updated Project M comprehensive stage build (77 stages + many improvements),Garbagehead4,36,6,29,"Hello, as well as better stages overall. 
This is also a great place to get started if you're new to Project M; I've arranged the download so that anyone with an 2GB SD card and a Wii can start from scratch. No homebrew

There is a very fine line between an annoying stage and an endearing one -- the latter of which all 77 stages included can ideally lay claim to. That said, it would make for an extremely boring game. All of the [stages from version 1.0](http://www.reddit.com/r/smashbros/comments/1aoegg/a_comprehensive_project_m_stage_build_77_stages/) are included, unless otherwise noted below in the change list. Enjoy!


**This build is designed around Project M version 2.5b (no wifi) (Hackless Wii)**


Riivolution and Dolphin users: You're on your own with this one

**REASONS TO DOWNLOAD:**

If you want a cumulative collection of stages from the entire Smash series, so if you downloaded 1.0 this would be a great time to upgrade. This build is perfect if you typically choose your stages manually and aren't planning to use your copy of Project M in a tournament. Lastly, if you're a complete n00b to Project M, this is a great opportunity to get started.

**REASONS TO NOT DOWNLOAD:**

If random stage selection and stage striking are critical to your gameplay. Both of these options still have issues. Many of the preview images on the stage select screen are of low resolution to prevent freezing; if the low quality bothers you

**DOWNLOAD OPTION #1**


1. Download the .rar file: https://rapidshare.com/files/3508877620/PMStageBuild2.0.rar (approx. 600MB)
2. If the download link is unavailable
3. Extract all the files to an empty 2 GB SD card.
4. Remember to delete your custom stages in normal Brawl if you haven't already


**DOWNLOAD OPTION #2**


1. Download the .rar file: https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B1XVf-zdlELwbDJRWEhMUnBoQUE/edit (approx. 600MB)
2. Extract all the files to an empty 2 GB SD card.
3. Remember to delete your custom stages in normal Brawl if you haven't already

**STAGE LIST**

[Go here](http://www.reddit.com/r/smashbros/comments/1aoegg/a_comprehensive_project_m_stage_build_77_stages/) to see what stages are included. All are the same unless indicated in the change list below.


**CHANGE LIST**

* Metal Harbor Shipdeck has been replaced with a neutralized Spear Pillar. The Shipdeck's novelty was good and all, and the plain stage design made it feel anything but unique. The other metal harbor stage was kept because the staggered platforms led to more interesting matches. Therefore, I replaced the Shipdeck with a much less annoying Spear Pillar. The floor of the 'basement' is entirely fall through, so as to discourage camping and insanely high damage percentages. Also, Pokemon do not appear at random and kill you, unlike the Spear pillar in Brawl. The BRSTM for Spear pillar is the Pokemon theme song (season 1).
* Sector Z has been replaced with [SSE: Halberd Interior](http://i367.photobucket.com/albums/oo113/EternalYoshi/al_091208_1249binout.jpg). Sector Z is essentially a slightly larger version of Corneria; it didn't make much sense to have two nearly identical stages. The interesting platform layout of Halberd Interior should make for better matches in the long run. The BRSTM for Halberd Interior is: [Tyven - Seven Lions](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5pyrMpHWClY)
* Final Destination 64 has been replaced with [Castlevania: Clock Tower](http://forums.kc-mm.com/Gallery/BrawlView.php?Number=9235). The physical layout of the stages is very similar
* Super Smash Land: Underground has been replaced with [Super Smash Land: Dr. Wily's Castle](http://forums.kc-mm.com/Gallery/BrawlView.php?Number=30930). Underground was removed because it was a cramped and awkward stage to fight on. Dr. Wily's Castle retains a unique platform layout while allowing adequate breathing room. **THIS STAGE IS FOR 2-PLAYER MATCHES ONLY** There seems to be a glitch with certain characters spawning on this stage. Characters will die randomly at the start of a 3 or 4 player match. This can be alleviated by using the stock control option for players 3 and 4.
* The Temple of Time and Super Smash Land have been swapped on the stage select screen. This was done so that characters would appear 3D in the Temple
* Fourside has been reverted to its original (Melee) form. There are plenty of other stages in this build that have been 'neutralized'
* Skyworld has been reverted to its original texture. The dark texture made the platforms a bit harder to see. On top of that

* WarioWare has also been reverted to its original texture. The villains background was too distracting.

* The Bulborb on Distant Planet is now friendly and will no longer eat you.

* Stage names on the stage select screen (SSS) have been corrected and uniform in appearance. ""Whirlpool Islands"" has been corrected to ""The Whirl Islands"", greatly improving the appearance of the SSS.
* Icons on the SSS have been redone for maximum clarity and their borders are now uniform in appearance. Some of the icons in version 1.0 were blurry and/or had a darker border
* Preview images display only the stages. Certain images depicted characters on the stage in version 1.0
* In-game music titles have been added wherever possible. Certain titles were impossible to add, therefore it doesn't have an in-game music title. When a match is started with one of these 'titleless' songs, the title simply displays a musical eighth-note and nothing else. If anyone knows how to manually add these titles in, I'd love to know.

* Menu 1 (X02) has been replaced with: [Stand Up - The Prodigy](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7w86qjdBnaQ) ( aka the Project M 'theme song')
* Castlevania music has been added to Dracula's Castle (Replacing Luigi's Mansion Theme).
* The BRSTM for Yoshi's Island (Melee) has been changed to: [Levels (Super Mario World Remix) - Avicii](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_apb7EcsWgc) 
* The volume of the Vs. Red BRSTM on Mewtwo's Stadium has been lowered to a tolerable level.
* The BRSTM for Whirl Islands has been replaced with: [Pika Girl - DJ S3RL](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCrLMwDz5qE)
* The BRSTM for Battlefield Ver. 2 has been changed to [Super Mario 64 - Devastation's Doorway (OC remix)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TD8z2liq9ok)
* Mona's Pizza JP has been changed to Gangnam Style
* Mike's Song JP has been changed to What Is Love?

**PROBLEMS AND HELP**

If there are any problems with the build or the download, SSS modifications, or in-game music titles, feel free to ask.

Not all the stages are perfect; if there's some that are a chore to play on
