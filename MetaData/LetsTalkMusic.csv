1374454861.0,1is634,"An analysis of Transmission, by Joy Division",Snowblinded,180,18,http://www.reddit.com/r/LetsTalkMusic/comments/1is634/an_analysis_of_transmission_by_joy_division/

The music of Joy Division, you will find the DNA of the German experimental pioneers somewhere in their sound.  The auditory chaos of Faust was enthusiastically studied and replicated by The Pop Group, This Heat, and all of the early industrial pioneers. Can took the controlled madness of The Velvet Underground's Sister Ray, an improvisation from hell that fused the rhythmic engine powering Rock'n'Roll with the untameable inventiveness of free jazz, and then extended The Velvet's explorations in a number of new directions. These innovations were in turn picked up by Public Image Ltd, The Fall, when fused with punk rock, incorporated musical ideas created or refined by the Germans into the punk template. For the most part

Joy Division alone sought to push the primal energy of punk into new emotional territory. While they steered away from the avant-garde experiments that many post-punk groups found alluring

At first glance, suffering from depression is not like living in a constant state of sadness or melancholy. People who suffer from depression live lives characterized more by vacancy than by sadness. It is a muted gray blanket that wraps itself around their lives and smothers the vitality most people take for granted, until existence becomes a dull blur of apathy. Thus, the icy calmness that can be heard in many Krautrock groups ironically ended up being more relatable to people like Ian Curtis then the youthful rage that oozed from every pore of The Sex Pistols.

This is not to say that the members of Joy Division found punk rock's off the chart levels of rage, but I think that they found a great deal of solace in punk's fiery discharge. This freedom and energy was a respite, however brief, from the maddening emptiness that robbed the world of Ian Curtis. If there wasn't a strong love for their influences guiding the band, then they would have had no trouble applying their somber, poetic, and utterly dark feelings to a James Tayler-esque pastiche of acoustic guitars and radio friendly melodies; following the path of countless other groups more interested in fast money and easy woman than in using music to express something deep within them that would have otherwise had no outlet. They would almost certainly have had more commercial success during their lifetime with such an approach. Instead, each other

Starting from the beginning, before the listener can settle in, the bass guitar blasts them with the main riff while the volume of the synth quickly plummets. This gives the song a doubly jarring start. First the synthesizer's rapid microtonal modulation sets the listener in a state of unease. Then, after just two seconds, the bass riff thrusts in at full volume and the synth fades away. The combination of the bass entering and the synth leaving makes the bass seem like it is overpowering the synth and taking control of the track. This impression is no accident. As with the majority of Joy Division's music, and unlike just about any other rock band, Peter Hook's bass playing takes a dominant melodic role within the song

The bass riff embodies the dichotomy between punk rock and Krautrock that I discussed earlier. On one hand, it also calls bands like Kraftwerk to mind due to its steady, machine-like nature. The first D is a quarter note, and it is followed by thirteen more D's and an A in eighth notes. The pattern is then repeated with C's replacing the D's. The quarter note and fourteen eighth notes pattern gives the riff a super rhythmic quality. Since their are no notes that deviate from the rigidity of the beat, the riff comes off as almost inhuman, summoning images of the desolate factories and layers of smog that enshrouded Joy Division's native city of Manchester, rather than the hormonal energy that a typical punk riff evokes.

While the song is structured around a verse chorus progression, having the same riff for both the verse and chorus increases the bleak, oppressive feeling the band were trying to induce. Not altering the riff creates claustrophobic effect; a sensation of being trapped that mirrors the song's lyrical themes. Secondly,  the members of Joy Division were one of the first groups to realize that having a steady, continuous, rhythmic melody gives the music a strong sense of propulsion. This technique would be wholeheartedly embraced by electronic musicians in the coming decades, but the members of the band, were among the first to realize the potential of such an approach. This is not to say that there aren't problems writing songs in this manner. Without a clear transition from verse to chorus, this bar contains the second half of the C repetitions as well as the closing A note. Instead

As the bass finishes the second repetition of the riff, is steady and machine-like. There is a reason Stephen Morris is called “The Human Drum Machine”. The hyper-steady rhythms he produced add to the icy solitude of the song. The pattern Stephen plays is two bars long. The first bar follows a ""One - Two - Three - and - Four"" pattern while the second bar goes ""One - Two - Three - and - Four - and"". Like the bass guitar, the drum pattern remains the same throughout the song, with two exceptions. First, there is a one off pattern he plays as he enters the track. Second, Stephen occasionaly adds an extra beat between the fourth beat of the first bar and the first beat of the second bar, creating a ""One - Two - Three - and - Four - and"" pattern, Morris' rhythmic rigidity connects the band to the robotic sound of Kraftwerk. However, barren place where life is fraught with desolation and despair. This contrasts the sound of Kraftwerk

Apparently there is a limit to the size of self posts that I wasn't aware of. I put the rest of the the piece up on my blog

1369280440.0,1evs7z,[Meta thread. Please upvote for visibility.] Some additions and clarifications to Let's Talk Music's rules,WhatWouldIWant_Sky,120,13,21,"So the other mods and I have noticed a few trends among comments and threads recently and have felt the need to establish a few new rules and clarify some already set rules.

**1: Be nice to each other.** 

Sometimes shit can get heated, but that isn't cool here.  Remember that music and art are subjective and people may have very different opinions than you do.  Also, art is free to be analyzed and over-analyzed, there is no such thing as ""bullshit,"" so there is no need to insult people who make insightful threads.  Also please remember that downvoting is reserved only for comments and threads that break the subreddit rules and not for posts you disagree with.  (Downvoting is also allowed in the album club nomination threads. That shit is full contact.)

**2: New threads *must* have content.**  

A popular thread has been the artist/album/genre specific ones.  Those are totally cool *if you have something to say.*  A good version of one of these threads would be giving actual thoughts and analyses of whichever artist, a description of an album, or a definition of a genre just because you have been listening to it recently and want to have other people talk about it.  Another bad example is saying ""I've never been able to get into X.""   As the discussion starter, you must have something to say, and must put forward a concrete opinionated thought about the band/album/genre that may be discussed. (Exception is for new albums. you can just go ahead and ask for other's thought on those). 

If your thread is a question

Remember: ""Try to engage in intriguing conversation. Trivial and uninteresting threads and comments might be deleted.""  This is judged on a case to case basis

**Now some nice things**

The above are just a few things that have slipped by.  For the most part, but you guys are doing awesome at generating good new discussions and keeping out that boring stuff.  Let's keep a tight lock on it! (remember to report bad threads and comments as well as downvoting!)

I really loved how they were able to fit in so many instruments at such a high pace. I never heard something like this before

Streetlight Manifesto: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xo76ijhUqjE

Then one day, unlike bands like Reel Big Fish. They mix their ska with dub, reggae and a bit of punk. It pulled me away from third wave ska and got me into Desmond Dekker and The Specials. They don't have much of their stuff on youtube, but their first album in my opinion, as a whole, is one of the best I've ever heard. Took me like 5 whole listens to appreciate it, but now that I do

Give this band a shot if you like diversity in the songs, and not 11 random songs put together on one CD.

After having listening to a lot of punk and ska, but for some reason, dubstep, electronic music and metal don't suit me at all. And if you ask random people, they will most likely recommend that kind of music. But someone on a football forum of all places got me listening to a band called Alison's Halo. I fell in love with them instantly. 

The vocals were so soothing and the guitars were perfect together with the vocals. This got me into the shoegaze/dreampop stuff. My Bloody Valentine, etc.

**Early Country &amp; Western**

Country originally formed out of a combination of different strands of American Southern folk music, with the rise of the ""Grand Ole Opry"" radio program, country became big business and the Nashville country music industry began to dominate the genre.

Jimmy Rodgers - [""In the Jailhouse Now""](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vSq8mnDH_1o)

The Carter Family - [""No Depression in Heaven""](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQ0eBSqy-Bg)

Roy Acuff - [""Wreck On The Highway""](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idFTT0qRGd4)

Hank Williams - [""I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry""](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WXYjm74WFI)

**Western Swing**

Drawing from jazz, Western swing is basically country dance music, mixing jazz improvisation with a string band twang. The style was jubilant and fast-paced and packed dance halls through Texas and the South.

Bob Willis - [""Steel Guitar Rag""](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxzxH6wIPCY)

Milton Brown - [""Four

**Bluegrass**

Drawing as much from English, complex chord changes and dexterous musicianship. 

Ralph Stanley - [""Man of Constant Sorrow""](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mndlk0qbIbE)

Bill Monroe - [""Molly and Tenbrooks""](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mv4Xuya_hG0)

Flatt &amp; Scruggs - [""Foggy Mountain Breakdown""](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=APl9fRFmdC0)

**Classic Female Vocalists**

There's this perception that women have it tougher in country music than in other genres, and country can lay claim to some of the best female singers and songwriters in American music.

Patsy Cline - [""Walkin' After Midnight""](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsRNCvHXHHU)

Loretta Lynn - [""Don't Come Home a-Drinkin'""](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OBnkAkmLtaw)

Dolly Parton - [""Jolene""](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiO3SIOOc_4)

Tammy Wynette - [""Divorce""](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQs3jZbxFTQ)

**Rockabilly**

Inspired by uptempo honky tonk jams and rhythm &amp; blues, more aggressive version of traditional country. It's influence would be felt through most of the early rock 'n' roll stars, who if they didn't come out of the genre, were likely listening to it or dabbling in it.

Carl Perkins - [""Matchbox""](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPQwtalHNNk)

Elvis Presley - [""That's Alright Mama""](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWgprZu4Hk4)

The Johnny Burnett Trio - [""Train Kept A-Rollin'""](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YtcVvWRvrIU])

**Countrypolitian**

In the mid-1950s, creating an almost factory-like production of solid pop hits. And as with Motown, a lot of great music came out of it.

Charlie Rich - [""Behind Closed Doors""](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uOQI2-4vkCQ&amp;feature=related)

George Jones - [""He Stopped Loving Her Today""](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poueMAJjOxE)

Sammi Smith - [""Help Me Make it Through the Night""](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HonH-w7mGlQ)

**Outlaw Country**

A direct response to the slicker Nashville sound, and a lot of its stars would go on to crossover country success, it left an indelible mark on the genre. 

Waylon Jennings - [""Lonesome

Johnny Paycheck - [""Barstool Mountain""](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QY6b7Gel1c)

David Allen Coe - [""You Never Even Called Me By My Name""](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOVRkSCWmg)

**Early Country Rock**

Rock music drew a lot from country in its early days, during Gram Parson's tenure with the band, put out *Sweetheart of the Rodeo* and played the Grand Ole Opry. Country rock developed out of such crossovers and was a distinct style through the early 1970s. It would get picked up again by bands such as the Meat Puppets for awhile in the 1980s and later by alternative country acts from the 1990s to the present.

New Riders of the Purple Sage - [""Henry""](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTNRsoBhnqM)

**Classic Singer/Songwriters**

At its heart, properly adapted, could just as easily be the best R&amp;B songs, the best pop songs or the best rock songs (and often have been). 

Johnny Cash - [""Folsom Prison Blues""](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWsuVuw5JO4)

Merle Haggard - [""Mama Tried""](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKuc4nfJByc)

Willie Nelson - [""The Redheaded Stranger""](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wuyzrqEA2DQ)

Kris Kristofferson - [""Sunday Morning Coming Down""](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEb46DL9QIQ)

Townes Van Zandt - [""Lungs""](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Rdm8LItAHs)

**New Traditionalists**

This is what most people think of when they think of ""modern country."" It begins with a group of artists in the 1980s who work country back to its roots, exhibiting some great musicianship and some sturdy songwriting.

George Strait - [""Amarillo By Morning""](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KrrsLZaY9s&amp;feature=related)

Garth Brooks - [""Friends in Low Places""](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USzixAfD4As)

Dwight Yoakam - [""Ain't That Lonely Yet""](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4cPQ9mHYVo)

**Alternative Country**

Building out of 1980s indie-rock, the movement has a lot of sub-strands, keeping old country traditions alive but adapting them to modern themes.

Uncle Tupelo - [""Graveyard Shift""](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKo_1rVClOk)

Ryan Adams - [""Oh My Sweet Carolina""](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMZYRvDvgT4&amp;feature=fvst)

1347026478.0,zi84f,How aging has affected my taste in music. How is it affecting yours?,GodBeard,66,10,48,"Over the years I've been dismayed by the assumption we seem to be making as a society that older people are only interested in the music of their generation. Radio stations spring up overnight that cater to a very narrow-minded demographic, and with them

For me, it's more about noticing things I never saw when I was younger, and being more open to things that would have repelled me in the past. If anything, my scope seems larger, not smaller.

One thing I will admit is I am kinder to certain nostalgic favorites. Certain artists, and Robyn Hitchcock, really can't do much wrong in my eyes anymore, because I have been on a strange long journey with each of them for decades. I can see their indulgences and their diversions in retrospect and have come to regard them as a friend who I've been missing when they come out with new music. They have something to say, and I listen. I don't *always* like it, but I find I'm a lot more charitable with their foibles now. Also, the decades have given me time to think about their words, or I will notice a particularly clever turn of phrase that deserves more praise. 

In a similar vein,"" I would mutter. ""Embarassingly self-indulgent."" But I kinda get more of that now, even though I can't claim to really understand an artist that intimately, I can relate to the change in tempo, the choice of arrangment, the sentiment, sometimes nostalgic, sometimes craving peace and simplicity. I get it

I'm also open to more genres. I finally understand the stuff that made me passionate about music is not the end-all, I frequently find myself wanting to get out of my own head and not even be myself sometimes, and the music of a different culture really helps me do that. I was not a Punta or Gamelan or
Cumbian fan in my twenties

And I respect the negative space and silence you find in music now. The dark and the light. The chairoscuro of Brian Eno, but I feel much less impatience with it. I finally realize sometimes it's okay that there is nowhere to go, nothing to do but enjoy the moment, and that I really had trouble with as a young person. 

One thing aging has not done is kill my curiosity. I anticipate releases by young bands just like younger people do, I will always keep with me. To me, there's nothing bad or diminished about music nowadays. It seems like I am constantly finding new artists I like. Sure, I will always have sentimental favorites. But that is not my primary focus, and I don't think it's any better than good music that just happens to not be my favorites. They are just a part of me because of the time we've spent together. Some new stuff will be a part of me someday, too. Frankly, I would get sick of a station that played only my sentimental favorites pretty quickly.

The Brian Jonestown Massacre is the brainchild and band of Mr. Anton Newcombe, then you should keep reading and look into them. If you have, it's probably because you heard of or saw the documentary *Dig!* which documents Newcombe as a psychopath megalomaniac, or maybe that you like the Dandy Warhols and you know the two bands were friends/rivals. 

In any case, covering so many subgenres, and that their music is actually good. Anton may deserve a little vindication for his egomania--he may be about half as good as he thinks he is. 

Here is the nitty-gritty. The band was formed sometime in the early 90s/late 80s. They are from San Francisco originally

Even in the early years, eight musicians get credit, including three for drumming. In any case, *Methodrone* is about as shoegaze as a record could be, and everything seems so agreeable. It isn't fantastic in any sense, but it is good and worth checking out. In the discernable lyrics, you can hear the beginnings of a lyrical genius. 

1996 saw BJM release three full-length albums, and *Thank God For Mental Illness*. The band proved to be a near-mirror example or what 60s revivalist should be, showing a range of influence from the Stones, Beatles, Kinks, Byrds, VU, Who, they release their ""commercial record"" in *Give It Back!*

In 1998 they released an okay record on TVT Records. It's forgettable compared to the previous stuff, all his friends had left him (I mean, watch the film on them. I don't know if it is 100percent accurate as an unbiased documentary (and I doubt it is), but it sure as shit shows how mean of a drunk Anton is). In 2001 the band releases *Bravery, Repetition, and Noise*, which is a decent record that would have sounded canon during Joy Division/The Cure's time in a post-punk/new wave world. 

In 2004 they released a retrospective ""greatest hits"" that does a very competent job at covering their career. This corresponded with the release of the documentary. After that, the musical influences (although interesting) reject mainstream rock and move towards a more slavic feel. Although it sounds like it would be cool, it's like a bad cross between Björk and elevator music. 

In any case, MBV, JMC, all of it.

Man's a genius and his music is awesome.

This post was inspired by the fact that it seems that many music fans know little or nothing about disco (except that it sucks). I think that a moderate knowledge of disco is useful in providing context for quite a few genres of music. If you are skeptical that you can benefit by learning something about disco

I hope to address some questions such as:

*What is the origin of disco?

*Did disco suck?

*What was disco all about?

*Why did disco die?

*Why did/do some people hate disco so much?

**The origin of disco**

Disco evolved from soul music (not rock or funk or electronic).   How did the soul music of Motown, soulies from northern England started developing an appetite for 24 hour dance parties that featured soul music with a fast tempo.  This soul music was not produced in England, but was produced in the US and found its way across the Atlantic by way of fans and collectors.  With the rise of the Beatles and the demise of soul/R&amp;B in the American pop charts (I am not saying these two events are linked) American soul artists who had a hard time selling concert tickets in the US, would travel to northern England to be greeted by thousands of obsessed fans.  Some of these soul artists (e.g. Major Lance) even moved to England for a time to enjoy the love that British soulies had for American soul music.  

I speculate here, up tempo, soul music. Maybe that had nothing to do with it, but the fact remains, following the demise of Motown, the soul community started to create a lot of up tempo soul songs that could be danced to.  A key player in this shift in soul music is the Philadelphia International record label. [MFSB]( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MFSB) was the house band of [Philly International Records] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_International_Records) and was [significantly larger than most rock bands](http://imgur.com/kmnBL8d) at the time.  MFSB featured people on guitar, bass, as well as several drummers, and also served as the backing band for a string of soul vocalists at P.I. Records.  This was NOT synth music.  It wasn’t robotic

Due to a disagreement with [Gamble and Huff] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamble_and_Huff) at P.I. Records, but they featured a lot more Latin percussion.  Many of their tracks featured timbales, bongos, and congas in addition to a traditional rock drum kit.  The output of the Salsoul Orchestra was all (or at least mostly) disco.  Vocalists for Salsoul Records included Loleatta Holloway, Rochelle Fleming of [First Choice]( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Choice_%28band%29), and Jocelyn Brown of [Inner Life]( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inner_Life). These women could sing the shit out of a song, and they brought undeniable soul to the proceedings. Other notable acts on the label included Skyy, Joe Bataan, and [P&amp;P Records]( http://www.artandpopularculture.com/P%26P_Records).  [Casablanca Records] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casablanca_Records) had Donna Summer and the Village People on their roster.  Unlike the other disco labels

1347987020.0,1034h0,"Do bands and musicians ""owe"" anything to their fans?",ZeagleFiend,56,4,63,"I've been thinking about this question on and off for a few months now

I went to the gig having recently discovered the band through their early 1990s output. Then, I press-ganged a couple of friends who have similar tastes in music into coming to the gig with me. I even looked up live footage of the band and [shit looked pretty good](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0nzk38zRJQ).

I hyped the band enormously to them

Instead

Not a noise-rock show, one of the guys stood up for a bit. Everyone surged forward, assuming that perhaps the band was going to play an actual *song* and that everything up until now had been a warm-up. The guy swayed around a bit and then sat down again to carry on fiddling with his pedals.

About 50 minutes into the show, and the excitement had been tangible, but even as my friend pointed out how the room had drained, we saw a couple of other people slope out, looking disappointed.

* Should they have been disappointed? Is this a valid reaction?

* The band played some ""regular"" shows last year. Was it a dick-move to do a noise show in front of a packed and stoked audience?

* Does it run against the point of art to ""expect"" or ""demand"" that artists do X or Y?

Of course, or collaborates with a left-field choice, people inevitably get pissed off. Is there any validity to this?

Another good example is [Bradford Cox's famous ""My Sharona"" debacle](http://pitchfork.com/news/45658-watch-bradford-cox-terrifies-audience-in-minneapolis-covers-my-sharona-for-an-hour/): was this a dick-move? Does Bradford deserve to be criticised and vilified for this (he was)? Is it reasonable to show up and simply expect him to run through *Parallax*?

***

I should probably mention that my friends and I actually really enjoyed the Telescopes gig: partly because the [opening band](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ie5cHAjK1Z4) was awesome, letting it wash over and through us, and it was kind of amazing. One of my friends is a huge experimental music nut and started going on about Xenakis and aleatory music and how interesting the techniques at work were.

Beautifully orchestrated chamber-sadcore. Jenn Ghetto is fucking brilliant, is equally brilliant. In the same vein is [Arco](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4NnAvD3j_A), a highly underrated group.

[Duster - Unrecovery](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIVRNP4e_cY&amp;feature=relmfu). Really lo-fi space-rock slowcore.

Now lets look at when the opposite happens. Many artists release classic albums and then proceed to release many mediocre albums afterwards. This

The artists I mentioned earlier, I believe that the mere fact that they only have two or three albums adds simplicity to their name. When somebody looks up a band for the first time and sees that they have already released over six albums, it can be a little intimidating on which one to start with. However, when somebody looks up Joy Division for the first time and sees that they have only two albums it looks a lot simpler and easier to get into.

Punk rock is all about intensity of emotion, and personal. Classics like the Buzzcocks and The Ramones are classic goto's but I'm going to list a few that stretch the limits of what the genre can be a bit, 

Bomb The Music Industry - Syke

These guys are great

The Ergs - Pray for Rain

The Ergs are probably the best straight forward pop punk band of the last decade

One of the other big movents in the genre has been the birth of ""folk"" punk. Planit-X is pretty much the big label for the genre. 

Andrew Jackson Jihad - People II: The Reckoning

When I was in 5th grade our english teacher gave us an assignment to make a poster of our favorite band. I don't even remember what I made but this girl I liked made a poster of The Offspring. This is around the time when Americana came out and I suddenly stopped listening to everything else and just listened to The Offspring. Until 8th grade I was mainly listening to a lot of popular punk bands and MTV. Then someone introduced me to Metallica, more melodic classic rock like Dire Straits and Jethro Tull. By the time I graduated I thought I was the biggest Pink Floyd fan the world has ever seen.

College was all about new music for me so I dropped my classic rock obsession and started to see live shows. I was ready to accept everything Indie had to offer from The Olivia Tremor Control to Four Tet. I was living in Vancouver at the time so I was listening to a lot of Canadian indie-famous bands like Broken Social Scene and Arcade Fire and Metric...

Personally I think if the core fans move away from a band/artist once they gain mass popularity it has less to do the ""hipster"" mentality, and was surprised to see Macklamore's name pop up on one of the pop stations, and then I flipped the next station and sure enough Thrift Shop had just started playing on that station.

One thing that I have noticed is that the concept generally does not interfere greatly with the songs, the beginning and near ending feature an audience and addressing the audience as though it were a live show. However, most of their songs did not feature any nods to the concept, but were simply played in a similar style. 

Another good example is ""Songs For The Deaf"" by Queens of the Stone Age. The concept is that the listener is listening to the radio as it goes in and out of radio stations while exiting Las Angeles (headed towards Las Vegas). The radio goes out conveniently after a song is played so that the listener can skip the excess audio. Again this does not interfere with the songs until they are over.

As a change of pace, but I don't understand how it is and if it is where to draw the line with other albums. I hate to draw this comparison because of how different the two are, but I feel as though it is a good example: ""Songs about Jane"" by Maroon 5. It has flow to it and features a story-esque feature in which the singer describes his relationships and feelings. I do not see how we can say that it is not just as much of a concept album as a Pink Floyd album is. I don't think the depth of the writing can be the discerning factor (Sgt Pepper's wasn't all that deep), nor the long flowing instrumental parts (that would restrict concept albums to few genres). Likewise, every Explosions in the Sky album could, in my opinion; be considered concept albums as the songs all seem to tell a story with similar style.

So, will the new tradition of buying songs and not albums cause concept albums to disappear or emerge to stimulate album purchases?

Thoroughly [weird](http://blog.iso50.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/picture-53-450x535.png) and always genuine frontman and driver Bradford Cox is steering Deerhunter away from noise a little bit more with every release. Halcyon Digest is not an exception to this trend, the more I can appreciate the minimalist, psychedelic, detail oriented music Bradford has always been about.

Much of the lyrics and riffs Deerhunter writes are a product of automatic writing. Knowing this not only makes the listener forgive the album's subjective flaws but also makes the high points that much more impressive for me.

I want to talk a little bit about my favorite, haunting, slow, and clean tune and the chorus ""only here... can make you feel lonely out here..."" gives me chills. I also especially like *Helicopter* and *He Would Have Laughed*, which is supposedly about/dedicated to Jay Reatard.

1)	Stew (a black male) decided to form a rock band in the 1990s and tried to get his band signed to a label.  Because he was lead vocalist
Stew’s solution: stay on a minor label and call his band “The Negro Problem” (because the music industry seemed to think that blacks do hip-hop and r&amp;b while whites do rock


2)	Rick Astley (a white male) was a soul vocalist


3)	Red Hot Chili Peppers released a song [Give it away] (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mr_uHJPUlO8) in 1991 that was awarded a Grammy for best hard rock song. While the Chili Peppers are white guys (who normally dominate hard rock) the song itself appears to be an example of funk with something akin to rapping used in the vocals.  


4)	MTV initially had a rock music only policy in regards to airing videos.  The video for Blondie’s [Rapture](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pHCdS7O248g) (a rap track by a white group) was aired by MTV because it was rock, and in 1983 Michael Jackson videos began airing on MTV.


5)	 Queen’s Another One Bites the Dust won an American Music Award for Favorite Rock Single and also got a Grammy nomination for Best Rock Performance.  Clearly the song was categorized as rock by the music industry.  The song was performed by white artists (who generally are known for rock

a) Do you reject the entire notion of a ""guilty pleasure"" because all taste in music is inherently subjective?

What comes to mind immediately is the *Cruel Intentions* soundtrack, to the Counting Crows, to the Verve at the end, fits together not only as a very strong representation of alternative music in the late 90s, but fits the overall, underlying sinister and cynical tone of the film itself. I would say that that is an amazing soundtrack. 

Another soundtrack that does the same is the *Donnie Darko* soundtrack, to the Church, Joy Division, and ""Mad World"", the tone of that film is aptly represented by the music. 

One soundtrack I do not like is the *Singles* soundtrack. Now, but doesn't really fit the plot of the film, which itself feels like a very contrived movie. I don't like the *I Am Sam* soundtrack either, because it seems like a forced gimmick to have a bunch of Beatles covers to compliment such a contrived, over-emotional garbage bag, and the covers (for the most part) blow ass.

At one point in the conversation I insinuated that taste can be good and bad. In the sense that your tastes can be developed or undeveloped, but I know my taste in modern RnB is very undeveloped. 

This angered my friends as they assumed I was telling them that their tastes were 'wrong.' When I really meant that maybe their taste in (insert genre) was not as developed as their taste in (insert different genre). And that taste and opinion do not necessarily have to co-relate. I can have an undeveloped taste in classical but still just think Brahms is a smelly fart.

This led them to state that their opinion has a right to exist no matter what, but there is something deep down inside of me that thinks that if your opinion is uninformed then it really has no right to exist or stand equally to others.

Where do they fail?,Bears_in_Bowlers,37,5,20,"I recently came across a conversation in my Twitter feed between the artists Madeon and Sebastian Ingrosso.  Madeon tweeted that he was excited about his new single and was getting ready to work on a full length album to which Sebastian Ingrosso replied

I think that an album is good to get across these big ideas but I'm not exactly sure what the big ideas might be.  Two great albums immediately come to mind.  The Mars Volta's “De-Loused in the Comatorium” and Pink Floyd's “Dark Side of the Moon.”  Each album has individual songs that I enjoy listening to but listening to the album as a whole offers a much better experience.  I think the album is great when it really nails that holistic experience.  At-the-Drive-In's “Relationship of Command” is an album that I really like but I don't feel it offers the holistic experience of the previously mentioned albums.  Relationship of Command centers around a common sound but I don't feel it offers one overarching theme throughout.  Most times when I listen to it I only listen to my favorite songs.  The question I have with these types of albums is not

Why do artists feel they need to put out an album ever if it won't deliver an enclosed experience?  I think for rock musicians it comes down to how the music is preformed.  Rock musicians primarily preform only their own music.  Performing an albums worth of material while constantly incorporating singles might get stale after a while and the excitement for the tour would dwindle.  I also think that an album is easier to market.  This includes the tour that comes with it.  I already know that the new Deadmau5 album is coming out some time in October and the hype for the album is growing with the labels marketing strategy

I think that albums move creative progress more slowly than singles or EP's, if not on the popular scene then with the hardcore fans.  I can't imagine Mumford and Sons doing anything else outside of folk inspired music.  If they change their sound fans will be in an uproar.  If they don't they'll become irrelevant when the next big thing comes along.  This goes for less popular genres too.  If you change your sound fans hate you, if you don't a cool new offshoot of that genre will spring up and you'll be irrelevant.

I think EP's are a great way to bring a change in sound to fans.  I think the Arctic Monkeys do this very well.  After each album they release an EP or two with a slightly different sound that generally reflects what will come on their next album.  I also think EP's can be marketed with a hybrid album or single strategy.

I think singles are a great way to stay on the cutting edge.  You can try out new ideas with little risk.  If you release one single and it's not very good you can move on very quickly with your next.  Fans will also be open when you try new genres or incorporate different sounds for the same reason.  If the fans don't like a new single the next one will be along quickly.  This also makes the music to progress very quickly.  No one single changes the landscape of a genre but a genre feeding off each other will move forward in little increments very quickly.  You are always exploring what is popular in your genre and cross pollinating sounds while still having the opportunity to take artistic risks and challenge yourself.

Dance music lends itself well to single and EP releases due to the way it's played.  The focus is on a continuous ever changing mix of different artists music.  I feel it's the DJ's job to find new

You know vaporwave? The genre with the pitched-down Diana Ross samples and slowed-down loops of 80's AOR ballads? As far as I gather this was the article that kind of started it. A bit pretentious and a whole lot more ""in-depth"" than what I think the artists originally intended, is there any harm in having so many?

First
*note: cheesy intro*

This is the first song that came to my mind when I asked myself this question

When I first heard this song, and I was thinking, ""this is perfect."" I can't exactly place the reason for my reaction, it was my first time having such a positive/emotional reaction to such a...non-emotional song/performance? Saying that is incorrect, I know, but I'm not sure how to word it. However, I believe that's the goal in shoegaze. But to be completely honest, but it probably wouldn't make into a top ten. If I go a long enough time without listening to it, that was a feeling of awe.


Second

This is from a similar Japanese shoegaze band called Spangle Call Lilli Line. I never expected to get the same feeling as I did from Lucky, gives me my moment of zen, I guess. The difference is, I can always come back to this, and...it just does it for me. Like for a lot of people, nostalgia is a moderately weighty emotion, and this song gives me a good dose of it while also allowing me to look out the window and just enjoy the moment. Like, but take a look around and realize that the present has just as much to offer"". The sad thing

I could easily post more and branch into other genres

I guess I'll answer it before it's asked. If not obvious by my previous statement, ""how the hell do you remember entire songs?"" Then the, ""duh"" moment...they actually listen to the lyrics. I don't know, I don't listen to them, and I rarely find myself caring to. Of course, all the time, I'll get catchy choruses stuck in my head and sing them all day.

Hopefully this list is broad enough to catch all interests and gives a good look into metal at the moment. 


[Carach Angren - Where the Corpses Sink Forever](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uGGuiN1Hnw) Incredibly theatric and shockingly accessible

[Pseudogod - Deathwomb Catechesis](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Su0buCsrE9A) If death metal is meant to be scary

[Panopticon - Kentucky](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAUtCa13V38) Bluegrass mixed with black metal. I wrote another post in this sub and I'll link to it [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/LetsTalkMusic/comments/10toax/lets_talk_about_landmark_groundbreaking_or/c6gj1ot). I think this is the best album of the year

[Pallbearer - Sorrow and Extinction](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBJfHuyGpsI) Grandiose without sacrificing song structure (or length)

[Dodecahedron - Dodechedron](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9GtKDhKz3Q) Dangerous and frightening in their sound

[Jumalation - The March of Jumalation](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ueNPpngrvY) Baby this is some straight up thrash metal. None of that new-wave-thrash-revival stuff here. If you told me this came out in 1986 I wouldn't question it for a second. A blast of a record and great example of the genre.  

[Pig Destroyer - Book Burner](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6liRVCaonME) What more can be said about these Baltimore heavy weights. Simultaneously making some of the most frightening and impressive music of the genre

[Midnight - Complete and Total Fucking Midnight](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k5-O5K1QGcM&amp;feature=BFa&amp;list=PLA06E6ADBE101B609) The ultimate 80's speed throwback, cheezy and lucifery.

I have a lot of these, and stone temple pilots fans rejected it on principle for not sounding like STP. but the record remains outrageously interesting even just for being a weird hybrid of grungy glam, lounge, and extremely aggressive electronics a la layers of heavily distorted theremin. these production decisions are really what keeps the album together, constantly jumping between being so prominent as to virtually throttle the rest of the music and being barely audible. and, as if that wasn't enough, this all happens on top a revolving door of songs that sound kinda like tom waits teamed up with slade to cover *hunky dory.* there's also this guy named [Victor Indrizzo](http://www.victorindrizzo.com/) who has credits all over the record; I have a suspicion that he had a lot to do with the adventures in sound contained thereon

For me, then you're doing the complete opposite of what ""punk"" is. Because by doing that, you're trying to fit in a social circle, whereas punk isn't a social circle, it's doing whatever the hell you want.

1342201394.0,wic2j,Let's talk metal.,CaesarOrgasmus,33,6,45,"It doesn't look like metal's really been covered here before

It's probably one of the least accessible of all genres and the ultimate in acquired tastes. I've been listening to it for about six or seven years now and only started getting into some of the (relatively) heavier forms within the last six months or so. That's not to say that more accessible metal doesn't exist

It seems like the vocals are one of the biggest turnoffs for those who don't like metal. Most of the time the topic comes up

As you can tell from the above playlist, the most highly regarded of whom tend to be Bruce Dickinson of Iron Maiden, Rob Halford of Judas Priest, and Ronnie James Dio of Dio and Black Sabbath. I thought [this article](http://www.invisibleoranges.com/2010/07/ask-a-real-musician-5-classic-male-metal-singers/), about an opera vocalist hearing some metal singers for the first time, was an interesting perspective on some classic metal vocalists. Basically what I'm saying is that many people don't realize how much metal isn't all about yelling, and it's worth looking into those bands.

Of course, which includes bands like Metallica and Slayer and was one of the earliest types of metal that I would say was truly heavy and angry. They spread and developed from there, and are now the staple of the heavier subgenres like black and death metal. I think the reason many people are turned off by these vocals is that they're used to vocal-centric music in which the vocals are the focal point and the instrumentals are secondary, or at least less prominent. This is reversed to a point in metal; rather than carry the music, the vocals serve more as another instrument or layer of the music. They're meant to contribute to the overall aesthetic, not take it over. I can't speak for all metalheads, but I think many would agree that the tone of the vocals is more important than the lyrics or any other aspect of them. So with that in mind, catchy vocals many people prefer wouldn't work for the overwhelming majority of metal.

Of course, especially knowing how long it took me to start to appreciate it. Ultimately, metal is still angry, inaccessible and esoteric, all of which would make for kind of a niche genre. However, I appreciate the role that metal fills in music; along with certain types of punk, it's one of the few types of music willing to address the darker parts of people and, society. There's a lot of social commentary and exposition, about the Rape of Nanking in 1937

There's also a lot to be said for the level of musicianship in metal. Many bands are impressively proficcient musicians, I think it contributes a lot.

But ultimately what it boils down to is a bunch of sounds that I like and that a lot of people don't. Nothing I've talked about made me like metal

&gt;Jazz as we tend to look at it is a style, you can make one minute’s music and take three months to compose one minute’s music. 

&gt;It so happens that because of historical circumstances, but we must remember in an absolute sense, jazz is more of a certain creative process of spontaneity than a style. Therefore, you might say that Chopin or Bach or Mozart or whoever that improvised music, that was able to make music of the moment, was in a sense playing jazz.

To take what he says and re-interpret it slightly. what we call Jazz music is really multiple things. It is:

1) A combination of certain instruments, pitch ranges, and physical characteristics of said instruments.

2) A set of techniques and approaches that are employed by musicians in a similar way. This can mean:

-A) In the broadest sense, the essential thing that separates Jazz as a genre from other forms of music.

-B) Jazz music, in particular 7th chords. The various structures, such as the theme, improvisation, theme pattern used in bebop and its children, or the patterns that give modal jazz its name, or even the difficult to describe but very real structures that guide free jazz. The way a single lead musician will function as either the sole melodic entity, The way that the improvisation uses the melody of its theme as a foundation. All of these things and many others

When a person refers to jazz music

This got me thinking. When we refer to particular genres of music, most of us have called up a pastiche of half baked notion that we cannot consciously identify when we think about a certain genres of music.  When I think about music in genres I have a strong understanding of, I have the ability to examine the music in terms of how it conforms and deviates from the different components of said genre. This allows me to better understand the individual groups/musicians, better understand the genre itself, and it allows me to create, hold, and defend my own viewpoints of the genre and its musicians. However, these kinds of analysis are off limits to me. I decided it would be beneficial for both myselfs and all of you if we were to pool our resources and analyze different genres in this manner. To kick things off

1) A combination of instruments assembled in a particular manner. The guitar, and vocals are the primary componants. Other instruments, such as keyboards, folk instruments, or industrial samples are employed less frequently, and are often what separates different sub genres of metal (folk metal is metal that incorporates the traditional folk instruments of a particular country, normally Scandinavian). These instruments also need to be assembled in certain ways for the music to be considered metal. The guitars need a lot of distortion. The vocals can be done in a number of ways, high pitched falsettos and the death growl and it's relatives.

2) A set of lyrical themes. There are a variety of these themes, they howled warnings of the consequences of staying apart. This darkened tone spread to a number of different themes: satan and the occult, murder and violence, Norse mythology, anti-Christianity, political horror, and much more. Christian Metal is an example of a genre defined by its lyrics.

3) A combination of musical techniques. For guitar, high speed and slow speed, solos (often technically demanding), palm muting, gallops, breakdowns, an emphasis on riffs, there is either an fast, and constant pattern called a blast beat, at least in part

I've been kinda bummed out that the ""new album"" and ""album with &lt;10k listeners"" weeks have been unpopular.  The problem is that most people are just discussing the albums they already know instead of listening to new stuff.  So I'm gonna try some new things before giving up and switching to new categories:

1) Listen to new albums!  Listen to the week's album all week write up your thoughts at the end of the week!  Don't just stick the album's you've already heard!

2)to encourage listening to new stuff

**How it works:**
You nominate an album or albums in however many categories you want

**Rules:**

One album nomination per post.  You can nominate as many albums as you want in as many categories as you want

Before nominating anything: look at the other nominations and listen to their samples.  Every month at least one person nominates an album that is already in that exact thread.  I don't want that shit goin down this time

1365394105.0,1bwbue,"The 'pay-versus-piracy' paradigm, 'selling art', and the concept of 'the industry'",Vemel,36,105

One of my online friends was in a sort of 'debate' with someone on Facebook regarding music piracy. It seemed kind of predictable in the sense that they were defending two different modes of music consumption that are perhaps outdated, which then seemed to turn into an essay aimed at no one in particular, hah. I think it'd be a good discussion for here. What I said:

-------------------------------------------------

""Hey

I think you guys are kind of embodying these two directly opposing views regarding the consumption of music. You have one side that's trying to convince people to pay for albums - albums they can already listen to in full for free via pirating and unauthorized rips, or trying to discuss the meaning of 'stealing' in the digital realm. I'm convinced that although those points have some merit, it's usually just after-the-fact rationalization for a basic hedonistic desire to listen to lots of music, without any real care for the larger implications.

The pay versus pirate thing is a failed paradigm. Neither side is going to last, and things change based on the people's desires, not some sort of static music consumption morality. CDs and vinyl are niches for nostalgic/materialist collectors. Storing files on your hard drive/s will end up being costly if you digitally 'keep' or 'own' a lot of music, and in that scenario it's a real inconvenience knowing you could listen to almost everything online, with your own library in the cloud. With people listening to a larger amount and variety of music, thanks to the internet, it's far from appealing to think that every album we come across must be paid for.

Many people are deciding they don't want to pay anymore. This is okay. And frankly, spiritual, and so on - then why are we making it something that must be bought? You don't see people on deviantART complaining that they're not rich, or people on Flickr whining that everyone can see all their photos for free. YouTube is full of people who put out content for free, and, if anything, might get some cash from non-disruptive ad revenue. Webcomics exist for the pure joy of the it. Donations and merchandise are optional. 

Maybe it's a different story with big-budget movies and games that are more openly commercial, well, I find some dissonance regarding the idea of -selling- your -art-.

I make music and I plan on giving it all for free. But I certainly won't stop anyone from donating if they would like to.

A counter-argument could be that, and outright defines their music as a product, would it be wrong to pirate it? Perhaps, in a sense. It would certainly be impolite, but this isn't the guy growing fruits and vegetables for the villagers. It really doesn't matter. Most people don't listen to music that exists outside of 'the industry', and I believe we have been conned into defending it. 

You are hindering a person, and possibly become wealthy and/or famous, by appealing to your capacity for spiritual expression, entertaining sounds, and imagery, and then seducing you into a transaction, so that they may live merrily, while you toil away in college and get into debt for the sake of a restricting 9-5 job in a questionable economy.

Think about that. Professional musicians use people.

I would personally love to 'escape', or something, but I am not selling a product, I am not selling an essential service. What I create also exists for its own sake and does not need the support of purchases in order to exist. I have no right to make money off of music, and those who claim they do are exaggerating their own importance. But, feel free to donate to us if you like. What it is is a voluntary gesture of respect.""

-------------------------------------------------

For some background - I'm a 19-year-old musician working/procrastinating on a debut album. The past year I've been getting my head deep into the indie world, and anticipating a scenario in which that happened, I'm trying to think of what I want, and what I value.

I personally hope to challenge the idea that one must be on one side or the other of this piracy argument. I want to challenge the idea that music is a product to be paid for. I want to challenge the idea that what we know as music largely consists of manufactured celebrities approved by the label-obsessed press, and that this is how you communicate with the world at large.

I could go on. But I'd like to think that the music aspect of our world would be a bit healthier if we reconsidered the way we 'get music'

People like to criticize the group for being all built on hype, DIY hype stuff that fit their aesthetic and fit the character of MC Ride: the low quality videos, the first ARG, releasing their album early and getting kicked off the label.  Yeah, their music benefits from the hype, but they are the ones who create it, and there is nothing wrong for enjoying something more due to its context.

Their first three albums seem to complete an arc for the character Stefan becomes as MC Ride, now, that there is more stuff to come from them, but it makes sense due to the artistic virtuosity they have shown in the past.

Contra for me is what got me to start liking them more, because it was incredibly smart, catchy, and was, the perfect response to all their critics. It reflects a lot on why we separate ourselves into groups based on stuff like class and what, is out May 13th/14th and lead singer Ezra Koenig has said it's the finale to a trilogy of sorts

1350069809.0,11dorw,Let's Talk About Religious Overtones In Music,JohnWH,30,5,21,"I wanted to discuss the (possibly) controversial topic of religious overtones in music, but instead of religious songs or albums by artists. A good example (and what got me thinking about the topic) is Sufjan Steven's Songs for Christmas and Seven Swans. I think both albums are gorgeous and the references/religious overtones contribute to a nostalgic and even tragic feeling within the album. 

In many cases, since they have no other place to go. An existence so painful, they have no where else to turn but God/FSM/etc. I think about songs like [""The Transfiguration""](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnGEPoH-HyM), [""Oh God, Where are You Now""](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-E3a6kW6LI), [""It's Christmas, Let's Be Glad""](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MXnkyx0PLcE). Beyond Sufjan Stevens, River City Extension's [""Standing Outside a Southern Riot""](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1Ro5DfAAo8)

Understandably, it gives a more personal look at the artist, their beliefs, and their history, and the extent of their love. Think about songs like [""My Sweet Lord""](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMgCpb1nli4) and [""Hear Me Lord""](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rK3zcleL-4U)

To be honest, and if so, does the concept of religion and God add to music?

Now a little bit about me to give perspective: I am not religious, I dislike most of it, no because it is Christmas music, but rather because I do not particularly enjoy the 50's crooner style of music. With that in mind, I find a lot of beauty in some religious songs, even if it is not the religion I was born into, since I can relate to the concept: The feeling of weakness, and even nostalgic feelings of family being around during the holidays.

So, I don't hate it nearly as much as I did a handful of years ago.  

I think there's a lowest-common-denominator approach that it takes which isn't always awful

I find that production-wise, but the instrumentation seems to be diversifying.  I'm hearing a lot of dirtier guitar tones and spacier keyboard backing, that sort of thing, along with more classic approaches that mix in the slide guitar and banjo.  It's such a weird amalgamation, if you stop and think about it.  They basically borrow from whatever has proved itself successful in pop music, and adapt it to their mass appeal sensibilities.  Can you really even continue to call this country music?

Lyrically, contemp country is more acceptable if you try to think of it as a sort of American middle-class zeitgeist rather than an expression of an individual artist.  After all, many country stars don't write their own songs.  It's music that is generated by pure demand of large demographic of people.

1348526345.0,10f0mh,"Often ignored, rarely discussed. I'd like to hear people's opinions on modern punk rock.",,30,6,http://www.reddit.com/r/LetsTalkMusic/comments/10f0mh/often_ignored_rarely_discussed_id_like_to_hear/, I totally get that the music isn't for everyone

Maybe part of the problem is that when people bring up punk it almost always becomes a discussion of ""well, I simply want to talk about the genre. Music that involves distorted guitar and power chords being played at quick tempos with minimal musical structure.

Here's what I always liked about punk. I liked the way that minimalist rock and roll could be made into an art form and how almost anybody could write a good punk song. The ferocity is a big part of it, where [their first album](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-atPgNwFP10) is one of the most aggressive angry records with beautiful musicianship (well, you know, for punk). Though opinions vary after ""Reinventing Axl Rose"" the band eventually became something akin to [those generic rock bands that you'd hear on car commercials.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rzJ21OpFnZ0) Not that their later output's quality can really all be attributed to the slowed down nature of the new songs, but it certainly didn't help.

And here's what I understand puts people off. They don't like that it sounds the same. They don't like that there's no variation in the music. It can be repetitive. I take especial umbrage with the ""it all sounds the same"" comment. Punk is as diverse a sub-genre as almost any other. Maybe not as much as metal, that's a point I'd actually really like to discuss. I'm a fan of a band who can make an album that sounds consistent, but there is a limit. There should be songs that sound like ""the standard"", the songs that conform the formula the band has been perfecting for years. When I anticipate a new album from a band, I want to know relatively what to expect based on their previous output. I like a surprise as much as the next guy, but there's a reason why I keep coming back album after album, keep at it. I do honestly believe if a band wouldn't be caught dead playing songs off their first few albums anymore that they should change their name and just be a new band already.

So

For anybody interest, DoctorStatic, amateur punk rock critic:

* [The Bananas](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTadTz84AoY)

Jangly pop punk with diverse song structures and dual vocals almost all the time.

* [The Brokedowns](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3aZZ64nWNw)

Heavy hitting metal inspired hardcore (think Black Flag if they kept a steady beat and without the jazz influence).

* [Diarrhea Planet](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HP2HBAsKktU)

Four guitarists playing pop punk inspired anthemic jams. 

* [Dillinger Four](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4YtTxV7UAo)

Gods of modern gritty pop punk

* [The Ergs!](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1feF-NX2jM)

This is what happens when a bunch of music dorks who like the best of mainstream rock and jazz start a pop punk band. [Alternative but less indicative song for reference.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGdusK8oDzs)

* [The Marked Men](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGzlSn4LEkk)

Incredibly tight musicianship from guys who just wanted to play power pop at lightning fast speeds. Most of this band's charm comes from the tiny intricacies of their songs that are easily glossed over at the first listen. All of their albums were recorded in one of the guitarist's back yard.

* [Night Birds](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIwVpn38_u8)

Surf influence hardcore. Sounds like Agent Orange meets Negative Approach.

* [Off With Their Heads](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fI17_xnxTk)

Gruff as fuck pop punk. Remember Screeching Weasel? Kind of like that but even more angry and depressed

* [The Spits](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U10Cb_IQKOg)

The weirdest punk band currently playing as far as I'm concerned. Singer sounds like a robot

* [Summer Vacation](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2H7PR0gMl4)

Inspired by emo and Weezer

* [Toys That Kill](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzMLr-laYrs)

Pop punk with a surrealist lyricist. Has never quite sounded like any other band I've ever heard.

I can listen to an artist who I would otherwise despise just because they can hit these perfect moments. But if they don't then they have to have a good composition. The music has to be flowing, without falling into generic. It has to have a good beat without being bland. It's not an easy road to walk, but that's why I feel if you can do it, then you are a good artist.

* Raw musically talent. If you cannot get up there and excel at your instrument or art, and do something that I know I can't do. If I wanted to listen to someone sing or play an overtly simplistic song, I can record myself and listen to it. Now this can be taken as subjective ""Well they are just playing to your level, I can't do that"" but for me the objective part is, I know I am not very good at this instrument, and I am at a level that anyone who I am paying money to listen should not be at.

* Willing to cross lines. Any artist that is willing to step over a line in musical genre and lyrical depth is someone that no matter their sound is good at what they do. It is not easy to bend the rules of a genre, and not in shock value. Or you have to be willing to be metaphoric, and lead your listeners on a trail to find the deeper meaning of your songs. (Although we then tend to try to do this with songs that there was no effort to make it metaphoric, and this usually leads to a misunderstanding of a song, but for me, a good song can be up to each person's interpretations. If you are lyrical profound enough to be able to have someone see something you didn't, you're doing it right).

But even though I have this list, who tend to look at music from a philosophical point rather than just something on the radio, really be true to an objective form? Take for instance Mumford and Sons. I like them, they are a style I like, but there tends to be a lot of people (especially on /r/music and /mu/) who despise them. They call their lyrics simplistic, and their style too generic. For me though they compose a good song, and they are willing to cross a few lines in the style of folk, I know)? So I ask you,,False

However, hip hop is a very heavy genre. It's basically a guy spitting bars after bars non stop. So every once in a while a skit is nice.

this year has been fairly disappointing so far; though I think that has more to do with the glut of great albums that came out towards the end of last year spoiling me. But first the positive:

**Surprises**:

* **[Lilacs &amp; Champagne - Danish &amp; Blue](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeJj7FCRYCg)** 

I mostly just wanted a new Grails album, it's more than just a placeholder.

* [**Boris - Praparat**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h5qDtmCnR80)

after a string of disappointing releases the last few years, it kind of feels like Boris' take on post-rock.

* [**No Joy - Wait to Pleasure**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBSeEF6UJqc)

there seems to be a lot more Shoegaze records being released

* [**Primal Scream - More Light**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LfPu5FQgFIU)

I don't think it's quite the comeback some of the reviews make it out to be as it could be whittled down a bit (Invisible City (which sounds like the James Brown track from Rocky IV) and Goodbye Johnny could be easily dropped)

this isn't all of my favorite releases


**Disappointments**:

* [**Flaming Lips - The Terror**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6J8O8Ououk)

I've posted about this before, a lot of fucking around (extreme song lengths, pointless cover albums, etc.)

* [**Black Angels - Indigo Meadow**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=812r_yzUJ_s)

it's a fairly logical follow-up to Phosphene Dream... it's just not really that interesting and kind of toothless. They've mostly traded their darker psychedelia for fairly tame standard psychedelia.  It's not unenjoyable to listen to

* [**The Knife - Shaking the Habitual**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEiwhP7j6JM)

I heard a lot of good things about this album, every track way overstays its welcome. Overall, it just sounds like an album full of underdeveloped tracks all just kind of thrown together because they didn't really know what to do with them. Easily the most pretentious release of the year.

there's other disappointments (Wolf People's Fain, but they're not bad albums so much as they are just a rather noticeable step down from previous albums.

Since this was in like 2004, pop-punk, nu-metal, metalcore, and things like that. I'm well aware now that emo started out as a DC area offshoot of hardcore punk, but i always had the MTV stereotype in my head when i thought about the genre: Skinny white kids with fringe haircuts singing about their breakups over glitzy instrumentation, a la Hawthorne Heights, MCR, it was already the 2000s era. 

However, The Get Up Kids, American Football, Cursive, The Rites Of Spring, as well as third-wave stuff like Brand New and Taking Back Sunday and have found out that most of this ranges from not bad to absolutely excellent. 

If you ask me now what my favorite band is, i would say that creative yet catchy instrumentation and intelligent but relatable lyrics were initial characterists that drew me towards them.

Now, it's not like that was the ONLY thing they sound like: their singer Jesse Lacey has stated a love for bands like The Smiths, Modest Mouse, Archers of Loaf, and Neutral Milk Hotel.

I know people say it's all about sex, it's about love, and fucking is a huge part of that. The first album is about a very young (remember, some memebers were 19 at the release), very real, very passionate *first* love. It brimms with excitement, curiosity, very much in love. 

In short, most artistic points in their lives. Not that it somehow discredits the album, just that's what it is. You met them when they decided to make a first album because their lives were at that moment so full of firsts that it made sense.

Clearly, and I feel like a completely different man than the person I was at 14, and I certainly don't feel the same way about love. I've had my firsts and things have started to cool down.

Can we really consider a piece of composition software an instrument? I've always considered it as a part of post-production, because I don't really consider a mute for trumpet or trombone an instrument; nor do I consider an effects pedal for guitar an instrument. I guess, I would have to consider a computer at best an emulator; not like a synth emulator, because that had it's own characteristic sound. Rather, I'd consider it just a sound reproducer. Like a Melotron of sorts. Ah, but the Melotron was considered an instrument. So really, I don't know where I stand.

The quote in question was following a line of Skrillex bashing, for that matter) production style, or what it requires; and more over what their live gig consists of. Personally, I'm a little slanted against going to an electronic performance, simply because not enough people want to be [expert knob twiddlers](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ercHzfvT6qY); I've even seen it be so bad as to the writter/composer/producer just threw the track on, and save for some minor level adjusting/EQing (which could just be handled by the venue sound man.) didn't really do much, save for some fancy posturing.
My experience seeing live performances of this kind of music tends to be that the performance quality is cheesy or bad; but I'm someone who loves electronic music and the frontier it presents. Although there is a bitter taste in my mouth

The quote also brought to mind the introduction of the synth and how it changed music forever. I imagine once the Polyphonic and Modular synths hit the streets, processor, and recorder; and I just can't imagine we could go much further. 

**So here's the real meat**; I want to know what ***YOU*** think: 

* What effects do you think purely generated music has had on the culture as a whole? Good? Bad? Different?

* What experience do you have with live electronic performance? Good performers? Bad performers? Seen anyone playing their laptop?

* Or would you consider them primarily/purely composers?

* Computers have a near infinite possibility frontier. What do you think would change the face of music

* **The big one:** Do you think a computer is an instrument? Or a production tool?

we're gonna rotate through 4 themes.  We're gonna keep doing a different genre every month (this time: **post-punk**), starting this month with **1999**).  I'm hoping this gives a good mix of albums that are known and loved by most, and albums that are new to most people.

This month's categories:

 * A **post-punk** album
 * An album by a band that has **less than 10
 * An album released in **1999**
 * An album released in **2013**

The way I want the game to be structured: 

* You decide to be a musician (or form a band with your friends?)
* If you're a label
* I'll post weekly ""sales"" reports that track the income and popularity of certain genres.  These genres will rise and fall in popularity, and musicians on major labels will try to ride these trends, to make the big $$.  Indie labels and musicians will make less $$, and constantly have to choose between their art or their income.
* If your expenses outweigh your profit
* Students will also carefully craft their 'image' (something I touched on in previous classes

I'm trying to keep it fairly simple.  (Though in typing this up I realize I'll need a fairly accurate list of record label expenses to offset the musicians' and labels' income)

Thus, nothing too crazy.  Thoughts that are guiding my ideas:

* What political events could influence music?  (for example
* How do genres split off into subgenres/influence future genres?  In what ways could this occur in the next 15 years?
* How do the ""rough edges"" of an underground genre get polished for  mainstream consumption (recently I heard a Selene Gomez song on the radio that had a wubwub bassline)

What genres could emerge?  What political events could occur?  What are some ways these could interact?  What do you think?

1347566148.0,zu74q,Jackson Pollock and Dubstep,Wargazm,35,17,74,"Disclaimer: I probably have no idea what I'm talking about.

My wife is an artist, there was no contest in my mind as to which one deserved respect as a real ""artist.""  But she taught me that the idea behind art like Pollock's wasn't to showcase talent or to depit anything real; it was more a reaction to the history of art, a distillation of the very act of painting to its mere mechanics: putting paint on a canvas.  

Ok, but this is the stuff I'm talking about): I think one can draw parallels between dubstep and abstract expressionist paintings like Pollock's.  When you listen to this kind of dubstep, a large part of it is created by noise.  There's high-pitched squeals, that grindy wub-wub bass; synthesized beeps and boops...essentially noise.  It's not trying to imitate any kind of ""real"" instrument, it's not trying to sound like a human performance.  Like pollock stripping down painting to its most basic elements of paint and canvas, these dubstep artists are reducing music to its basic elements of frequency and rhythm.  

To take the analogy further...can any meaningful difference be defined between any two splatter paintings or any two of these kind of dubstep songs?  Sure, and any preference that a person might have for one over another comes down to that person's subjective opinion.  

Thoughts?  Am I totally off my rocker for drawing these parallels?  Am I even making sense?  Like I said

I am a big fan of bands and artists from the UK in general but there are plenty of American bands that did well over there but did not gain the same following here in America.

Then there are so many spectacular UK artists that are staples of the UK music heritage that are all but unheard of in America.
Do people from the UK just have much better taste in music? Of course one can make the argument that America is a much larger and diverse country and so there is much more dilution in the music tastes. But i think there is more to it than just that. I find the mass majority of the U.S. music charts to be pretty horrible. The UK charts are much more tolerable generally. This is all subjective so there is no right or wrong of course

Here are some prime examples. All the bands/artists listed below have had some modicum of critical success and cult followings but failed to have much commercial success in America. They also happen to have produced some of my most beloved music.

American bands that charted very well in the UK but did not do so well in America include......

Hüsker Dü and Sugar

The Pixies had 3 top 10 albums in the UK. The highest any of their albums reached in the U.S. charts was #70. The Breeders had a similar experience on the charts between the 2 nations.

Dinosaur Jr. charted substantially higher in most of their albums in the UK.

More recently The Drums have charted in the UK but have failed to make a dent in U.S. charts.

The Eels albums have charted very well with 7 top 20 albums in the UK. #43 is the highest they have reached in the U.S. charts.

Flaming Lips have 10 singles that have charted in the UK compared to just 2 in America.

The Jesus &amp; Mary Chain had 6 top 20 albums in the UK. #98 was the best they ever did in the U.S.

Pavement had 3 top 20 albums in the UK. Never had an album chart higher then 70 in America.

There are a ton of UK artists that have charted very well in their homeland but never made much of a dent in U.S. charts

New Order has 7 top 10 studio albums including 2 #1 albums. Zero top 10 albums in the U.S.

The Smiths only had 4 studio albums. All 4 of them charted either #1 or #2 in the UK. In comparison they charted #150, and #55 in the U.S.

The Jam are almost unheard of in America. They had 4 top 10 albums in the UK.

The Pet Shop Boys have had 13 top 10 albums in the UK. 1 top 10 in the U.S.

I could go on and on with great UK bands that have had very little commercial success in America. Billy Bragg, The Beta Band, Badly Drawn Boy, Joy Division, Pre-1990 Depeche Mode (which i think is their best work personally), Elbow, Electronic (Bernard Sumner of New Order and guitar god Johnny Marr of Smith's fame), XTC, The Stone Roses, Yazoo
What are your opinions on this disparity? Would love to hear from some people from the UK.

I'm using the term alternative very loosely here since modern indie culture has in some ways merged with mainstream

But why is this? There's so much 90's admiration going on these days. Whether it be a celebration of the music, but the 90's seemed to have an attitude or quality to it that has completely vanished in recent years.  [This video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zDgpQBaziy0) for me sums up this 90's attitude pretty well for me personally. It seems that te 90's represented a movement that was pro-normal people. This is evident in the rise of the DIY attitude, 90's ""slacker"" culture, and the anti-extravagance of grunge and indie rock. Anyone could theoretically be a rock star in the 90's alternative rock scene. Music and attitude was all that mattered. You didn't have to have hollywood looks or traditional music talent to make it in the music industry. As long as you were creating something inventive and different, you could be a 90's alternative hero.  

I feel like many people, 90's alternative celebrates the average and unpolished. I understand that these values have always existed through modern music and culture, but this movement seemed to culminate in the 90's when bands like Nirvana were present in the mainstream. This is another reason why Nirvana's legacy will probably outlive it's actual musical output. Kurt Cobain was somewhat of a martyr for this 90's set of values. For once there was someone present in the mainstream that was very vocal and very honest about a lot of the bullshit that goes on in pop-culture. Much like John Lennon, Cobain's death is still an open sore that will take much longer to heal than most other celebrity deaths. 

So am I full of shit? I really think this is the underlining appeal to 90's culture. For once there was a somewhat mainstream movement that looked at normal people endearingly, many people, understandably, don't want to let go.",,False,self,True,t3_oeh76

Constellation: They are based on Montreal, Colin Stetson and many others. They seem to specialize in the experimental and orchestral. I first came to find them through a love of GY!BE and Silver Mount Zion and thanks to them I found amazing music from Hrsta, Hangdedup, Vic Chesnutt and Pat Jordache. 

anticon: They started off as a collective in LA and specialize in the more out there experimental hip hop. Right now they seem to be pushing Why? really heavily, Tobacco and Dosh and the former home of Sole and Sage Francis

This album's got a bad rap. The conventional story is

Critics scorn it. Fans overlook it. It gets put on lists of ""Worst albums of all time"". It's the redheaded stepchild of their discography.

And I don't think it deserves to be.

Now let me be clear: it is nowhere good as those albums mentioned above. Where they're experimental, it deservedly inspired none.

But as a follow-on from *Loaded*

The first track, would all have been fine additions to Loaded's pop sound. More than anything they sound like something John Fogerty could've written: bright swaggering rock songs with tight pop sensibilities and an irresistibly brash simplicity.

""Wordless"" has a cool honky-tonk darkness to it - just a bit of filth in its toes and it could fit right in among any cut off *Exile On Main Street*; a bit more strangeness and Tom Waits'd lay claim to it.

""Friends"" is, this'd be it. The arpeggio'd chords are a simple rip-off of Reed's style sure, but the mood and songwriting are as good as any such song he's written.

""Crash"" is a throwaway song, but very similar to the kind of thing Lou Reed did in ""I'm Sticking With You"" or ""Lonesome Cowboy Bill"". ""Jack &amp; Jane"" sounds like Reed as well, and if he'd had this for his solo work it'd surely be well-regarded.

And the closer, an attempt at the sort of prog-pop that McCartney realised so well on *Abbey Road*. It doesn't quite get there, not entirely, but it's definitely worth a listen.

It's obvious that Squeeze is heavily indebted to Lou Reed. It's also obviously very much a clean'n'simple pop/rock affair held back by the limitations of execution - but beneath the hood it's actually really quite cool, would a Reed-led *Squeeze* really have been much better? (I mean yes, but not as dramatically as the critics'd have you think.)

The album is flawed. Its songs beg for a raucous attitude that Yule just can't quite deliver; his style leans more toward perfectionist care. And placed beside *White Light/White Heat* it definitely seems an embarrassing little thing.

But it *is* a natural evolution for the band

Give it a listen

And closing note: why does it get such critical scorn? I think partly because of obscurity. Not many people have listened to it. A conversation between two who have is *very* rare indeed. That being the case

One year ago, he came with this *best albums of all time*. I have been using this list and that helped me quite a lot to discover great albums or classics. One thing I love about that website is that the owner tries to take all the critics lists from all around the world, so we are not blinded by our favorite magazine from the States (or UK) and have the most universal point of vue (for example, *Fiona Apple*'s *The Idler Wheel* was extremely appreciated last year in the States and topped many top 10 end of year list in America, but was disliked-ish in the rest of the world ; or *Metronomy*'s *The English Riviera* had the opposite effect). Even if the website looks quite old, it is still updated, with the top of albums each year, sort of metacritic score but with more critics from all around the world.

If I tried to apply the limited knowledge I have of Metal culture and map Metal genres according to their connection to outside culture, Rap Metal and several other hybrid genres. A little deeper we'd have classic Heavy Metal as well as Trash, Goth and Glam variations. Power Metal, the genre that my friends consider the gateway into Metal culture, would be situated pretty damn close to the center.  
  
This is the thing that bothers me the most about the genre - the self imposed ghetto in which it has resided ever since Nirvana banished ""True Metal"" from the face of mainstream. Most Power Metal bands seem to be only influenced by previous Power Metal bands, chord progressions that always start on the tonic chord, europoppy melodies, strings/pads on the keyboards, guitars that only play either power chords or shred solos and dramatic cliche-laden lyrics that avoid sounding too modern. I can think of many musical ideas that could breath fresh air into the genre (mostly revolving around importing methods of creating an ""epic"" atmosphere from other genres, from Rock to Baroque), but as it seems, and those who do often fall into a different one.  
  
The lack of communication goes from the other side as well. I don't think I have ever seen a major (not Metal-centered) music publication even acknowledging the existence of Power Metal, singer-songwriters dabble in EDM and Hip-hop producers sample every genre from early Jazz to video game soundtracks it sure is weird to see a scene that maintains no direct connection with the outside world.  
  
I know that there are many Power Metal fans with eclectic tastes in music; why isn't there eclecticism in Power Metal as well?

Essentially

&gt;*Originality* in modern rock is something practically unheard of.

At the risk of being *that* pretentious asshole who scoffs in the general direction of modern music

I did find it interesting that Starosin incorporated the historical aspect of ""music revolutions"" happening and then dying out by the gradual reduction of their artistic potentials (i.e. classical music sort of died out as all its possible branches of innovation were exhausted). So

Our opinions diverge

&gt;Punk offered nothing new and never wanted to offer anything new - on the other hand, throwback counter-revolution - an intentional try to drive the music back, not just to its roots, but to its primitive roots. The claim that 'art needs rejuvenation by returning to its roots' is ridiculous in this context. Punk wasn't a rejuvenation of rock music, it was its archaization

and similar statements about electronic music. Starosin is undoubtedly more fond of and respects prog rock far more as a genre than punk rock. So, not exactly rebuttal, but something of that nature:

&gt;In its initial form, I knew that what was needed was some pure, stripped down, no bullshit rock ‘n’ roll.-Tommy Ramone

So I guess the reason I posted this was to ask a few questions while referencing one of the most knowledgeable people I've come across on the internet when it comes to popular music (or at least probe the music-respecting consciousness of anyone who visits this page):

1. Is Starosin right when he says ""Rock is dead""?
2. Are punk and electronica
3. If you can, etc. (so not *derivative*)
4. Finally, possibly not dependent on any bit of popular music since the revolution of the 60s? Will someone come along and be so original that they **blow our minds** with that originality and contribution to music, art, and our livelihood?

And it's rather easily accessible while still being layered and complex enough to not become boring quickly. It's basically the album I'd recommend to everyone who (thinks he) doesn't like prog - and to those who do too, of course.

**Summary**

Characterised by their mix of folk rock, the Lovin' Spoonful formed in Greenwich Village in 1965, which, at the time, played host to many musicians such as the Mamas and the Papas, the Velvet Underground, Simon and Garfunkel

Achieving nine top 20 singles in the US (of those, which went to no.1 in August 1966) and two top 10 UK singles, the Lovin' Spoonful were at the forefront of the American folk music revival of the mid-1960s with bands like the Mamas and Papas, Jefferson Airplane, Joan Baez, Leonard Cohen, Bob Dylan and the Byrds. 

However, they portrayed a kind of imagery that the Beach Boys were known for using: innocent, child-like, and romantic, differing from the social commentary that Dylan inspired. 

Led by John Sebastian, partly due to a drugs bust that had damaged the band earlier. They can be compared to the Kinks in a way - although they had several hits their time, they were mostly overshadowed by bands like the Byrds, and were never really that popular in the UK. 

Yet they were a catalyst for the segue from folk to psychedelic rock in the US,False,self,t5_2t4it,1366657970.0,,,t3_1cvhet

After 8 or 9 listens over the past week, but I still think it's a step backward from *Cosmogramma* and *LA*.

I think the biggest problem for me is that too much of the album seems sort of formless. Throughout the first five or six tracks in particular

I also don't really like the track sequencing. Songs like ""Sultan's Request"" and ""Putty Boy Strut"" sound really out of place after the relatively reserved first six songs

Having said that, more reserved sound, and when it works it's absolutely beautiful. The Erykah Badu and Thom Yorke features were both excellent, and I really love hearing Thundercat play bass. Favorites are probably ""Putty Boy Strut"", the See Thru to U/Until the Quiet Comes/DMT trilogy, and ""me Yesterday//Corded"".

Personally I'm a fan of the Kurt Cobain philosophy. Great albums deliver great songs again and again, even without any direction in mind.

Yo La Tengo's [I Can Hear the Heart Beating as One](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Can_Hear_the_Heart_Beating_as_One) is a perfect album in my opinion. YLT attempts almost every style of music across the indie or experimental universe and the results are usually awesome. Almost every song on this album could inspire a whole album. Every song is incredibly different

1325574158.0,o0ub4,A Music PhD and Composer's Technical Assessment of Hans Zimmer's Work,PutMeInTheGameCoach,21,6,11,"Hey guys

""I'll preface my answer thus. Musicians tend to have very strong feelings either extolling or decrying the abilities/work/effort/etc of film music composers, Copland, even) who weren't impressed with the younger generations. Often these discussions or accusations (take your pick) revolved around which film composer pilfered from whom, which film composer has no technical fluency on their own, and a trying to disentangle and define and/or justify spate of highly subjective measures (what exactly makes a string section's swell at the acme of a romance flick ""sappy""?) What a lot of these arguments focus on, of course, is the music qua music, myself included

Zimmer is a master at capitalizing upon the function of music within a film. (Not always, and this is for two very different reasons. The first reason is because he has built upon generations of film composers who (again, North, Herrmann, Bernstein (both of them), Rota, and others) established the common filmic-sonic tropes: the eruption of dramatic/pyschological/​sexual tension should be (as it already is in common-practice and some contemporary music) a vast growth with a moment of high resolution and finality, and then think about any kids' movie or comedy and/or sunshine/dogs/youth/​puppies/energy - those pitches are always used, and this leads the second reason - his techniques. He doesn't have a very rich vocabulary, despite my intellectual problems with him not having one. Inception

Again, nothing from radios or persons or machines in the actual frame) - is at a disadvantage and cannot compete (there are exceptions where it becomes the central narrator, though) because the audience will revolt. John Williams writes anthemic scores, memorable scores, but they're always subservient to everything else. And even he has only two or three tricks he uses consistently.

What Zimmer does is continue to use these techniques in very proper ways - but he has found the ability to balance between the intangibles. 

This all said, hold up under scrutiny from either an academic or a lay audience member if it were performed in a concert hall. The music on its own does not convey enough maturity or growth or complexity to warrant maintaining someone's attention. Yes, his music is not ""designed"" with that in mind, but this would be the case if the score for Inception were to be performed live at Carnegie Hall. People would revolt and walk out, because they're bored. The cognoscenti would point toward pieces by Penderecki (Anaklasis and De Natura Sonoris I/II)* when the giant, relatively-discordant chords sounded; they would point toward Barber's ""Music for a Scene from Shelley"" and Gorecki's Third Symphony (First movement) whenever Zimmer pulls out the slow-build guns. And, yes, as there are in literature and visual arts, cannot do this. Imagine a straightforward rom-com with Wagner's Lohengrin underneath it, but if his imprints in technique remain from film to film

A last note, but the execution in minimalist composers is so vastly different... For instance, Philip Glass composed the scores for Kundun, The Truman Show, and The Hours, and his music works very well in film - but his concert music is different enough in purely technical ways that I rarely find it boring.

*Parenthesis/footnote: the entire 1950s/1960s avant-garde became a feeding frenzy for composers from about 1980 onward. Early works of Kancheli, Penderecki, Lutoslawski, Ligeti, and many an Eastern European were freely scavenged for technical things by later-generation film composers.

For your pleasure

Aren't you glad is a song off the album Wild Honey. Wild Honey doesn't sound like a typical Beach Boys album: It was recorded and released a little after their psychedelic famous period, the lyrics are undeep and unliterary, and this helps the Beach Boys put across a deliberate carefree feeling in the music.

Aren't you Glad epitomizes the carefreeness and whimsicality in the album. The beach boys have deliberately used many musical devices to achieve this

* The rhythms are simple: The piano plays chords repetetively on every beat through the verses, simple sound of the song

* Also, which again lends to the light feel

* The fills between the chorus and the second verse is vocal

* There's very little 'filler' sound. The more active songs on the album have maraccas and tambourines and organs and strummed guitars for adding sound without adding too much extra rhythm. Aren't you Glad has almost none

* The singing is light and soft, and also sincere. Soft singing as a method for achieving sincerity contrasts very strongly and successfully with the karaoke-histrionics idea of 'If I shout it louder then I mean it more' taken by songs like My Heart Will Go on by Celine Dion and Whitney Houston's recording of I Will ALways Love you.

* There's not much harmony singing.The verses are sung in solo

* Similarly, but it's not a huge departure from the tone of the verses.

* The choruses are also quite short

* There are a few parts which directly lend to the whimsy nature of the song (and the whole album). My favourite is that when the vocals sing ""I got a heart that just won't stop beating for you"", because he's so so innocent that he might actually do that

* The song is very short,,False,self,t5_2t4it,False,,True

In my opinion, I find the music objectively good. Streetlight Manifesto for example. I don't think you can deny that the music is good. You might not like, but you should at least appreciate it. 

How do you feel about this?

EDIT: I've come to realize that whether a song is objectively better than another does not matter at all. There is no point in being objectively better (unless that is something you subjectively care about

And I definitely do think there are a few objective criteria in music.

Originality: Has it been done before? I think this one might be the only one that actually matters...

Complexity of the song: How it all fits together. This one isn't really relevant. You either like it or you don't

Skill of playing the instrument: Even here there's room for debate whether something is actually harder to play

And even then

I guess there is more room for discussion in this topic

EDIT 2: My question has worded quite poorly. It would leave out all subjective opinion. So as soon as you start talking about subjectivity

Such as originality. Can you say this does not make a song objectively better? Let's say there is a song that is really original. Never been done before. You can't say it's subjectively bad because it's all a matter of taste, as this has never been done, unlike *insert unoriginal song*.

Atoms For Peace is the group that formed after Thom Yorke's solo tour for The Eraser. Thom, Joey Waronker, and Mauro Refosco. I've only ever seen videos of them preform on youtube and heard [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxWBd840E9g) single, but it all seems so promising. The energy between Flea and Thom live is definitely very interesting because that kind of musical communication doesn't really happen with Radiohead. Radiohead is more deliberate and planned out and it seems like 5 musicians playing what they've worked hard to achieve. While Flea's playing in AfP is absolutely more deliberate than his playing in the Chili Peppers, he always brings that vibe of spontaneity to the stage and watching Thom interact with that with his guitar is very interesting and while Default doesn't quite bring that relationship to life it's probably the thing I'm looking forward to the most in listening to that album. Also, hey, new Thom Yorke related material.

Bosnian Rainbows is the other release I'm mega pumped about. Most haven't heard of the band by name because it would be their first release, is Omar's primary project at the moment and is employing a more ""democratic"" system. Omar has never really had a creative partner that he wrote with excluding Cedric and even then Cedric only wrote vocal melodies and lyrics, so this is really exciting for long time fans like me. I recently had the fortune of seeing Bosnian Rainbows live, as they are currently touring their material before recording the album and releasing it early 2013, and the songs were noticeably different than solo ORL songs.

As I've eased into it I've found that it can be nice actually. I've started buying digital rather than importing obscure albums from Europe from bands I love. Quicker and cheaper! And of course there's the obvious added bonuses of it being easy to sample music now.

But here's the thing that kills me. As open and accessible as music is theoretically, and I was a bit skeptical, but their old stuff was great so maybe that was a diversion. Then I remembered why: album available on iTunes.

I hate iTunes. I don't like their use of non-standard formats. I don't like Apple

You may not share my opinion, but I thought the idea of free music these days was the simplicity of access? Now there's one more step and it's further removed from the general web where we do everything.

To me the ideal is simple merchant service. I love Bandcamp personally. I love its simplicity and its plethora of format options when I buy music. And recently they've been rolling out a beta ""social"" feature that lets me keep up with bands I purchased. But even that feature is so simple, download the music. Amazon is close, but you do have to install their downloader. And of course, if a band can self-release their digital content, I think that's great. They could likely stand to even drop a buck from the total album price since nobody else is taking a cut, making their own solution more competative while remaining lucrative.

Does this bother anyone else? I realize there's some comfort into consolidating into one service for the sake of backup (a big reason to use Steam for games). Is there a better solution?

1. Should I remove the covers post despite it being very popular with yer masses? 

2. Should I let it stay and then

3. Should I allow the covers post to remain but continue with strict moderation in the future (I might be interested in an additional mod or two since the others don't seem to be doing much)?

Pearl Jam is basically a straight rock band. Their album ""Ten"" is often called the ""best grunge album"" (see http://goo.gl/aUhL9s), 12 of 14 songs clocking in at 3:30 or longer, very well played and clean production.

Alice In Chains is a hard rock/metal band that sounds closer to Iron Maiden than Nirvana. Lots of vocal harmonizing

Soundgarden is somewhere in between. Incredible paint peeling singing

What do these bands have at all in common with Nirvana's sound? Nevermind is a brilliant album of noise, tight emotive drums, and simple song structures and playing.

I originally started this as a complaint about how laughably easy it was to remix a pop country song so that it was transformed into a pop R&amp;B song

Catchy, I commend Florida Georgia Line for being able to create a country song that is two instrument changes away from being pop R&amp;B, but it's still kind of ridiculous. [""Cruise""-Nelly remix](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmZ9xRO7M9M)

EDIT: Thought [this article](http://www.nature.com/srep/2012/120726/srep00521/full/srep00521.html) would be relevant as well. Talks about trends in music loudness

EDIT #2: /u/Capn_Mission has asked that I give a tl;dr for the article (I will admit that it is very mathematically involving). I do not have the attention span or mathematical/scientific prowess to confirm the following summary as all-encompassing for the article

&gt;By exploiting tools and concepts from statistical physics and complex networks, and loudness in contemporary western popular music. Many of these patterns and metrics remain consistently stable for a period of more than 50 years, which points towards a great degree of conventionalism in the creation and production of this type of music. Yet, we find three important trends in the evolution of musical discourse: the restriction of pitch sequences (with metrics showing less variety in pitch progressions), the homogenization of the timbral palette (with frequent timbres becoming more frequent), and growing average loudness levels (threatening a dynamic richness that has been conserved until today).

So

1. Less variety in pitch progressions. That means more simple G-C-Em-D-G-C-Em-D progressions and so on. Less variety in chord structure, great tunes did not have a whole lot of variety in the chords at the foundation of the music (hell, [""Heroin""](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffr0opfm6I4) only has ~2~ chords), but this study does not only count pure chords, but the chords created by *every single instrument in the entire arrangement*. Try notating John Cale's excursions on the electric viola in ""Heroin"" if you dare...

2. As /u/Capn_Mission said, and novel timbres are being used less and less in favor of ""Generic electric drum pad #1"" or ""Generic space/dance noise #2"" etc.

3. Lastly, I don't entirely understand) the [*loudness war*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loudness_war) that much ink/keystrokes have been devoted to debating. Essentially, the article argues that because the (all things made equal) loudness of a mixed song is gradually increasing (industry technique to make music more ""exciting), we have less of a potential for dynamic range in music. So, if a song at any specific point can be rated on a scale of 1 to 10 (played out of the same CD player, speakers, headphones, as long as the input is *the same* comparing different songs), believe it or not)

I think we can all agree that popular music has always been somewhat ""formulated"" and crafted as a response by record companies and artists to make the most money off of the ""lowest common denominator"" of music that will be accepted by everyone. And if I called everything before 2000 or some arbitrary year ""groundbreaking"" or whatever before it ""all went downhill"", had a few compositions lacking in complex chord structure and lyrical depth.

**That being said**
&gt;Popular music belongs to any of a number of musical genres ""having wide appeal"" and is typically distributed to large audiences through the music industry.

As with any format, it’s something like an iPod. On the other hand, I’ve settled the jukebox near my kitchen, and it’s over 300 pounds… so it’s not nearly as mobile. That means anytime I’m listening, I’ll most likely be in the kitchen– similar to how an ordinary stereo system stays in one spot.

Of course, but must be entered individually. Because of this, no benefit is bestowed upon albums in the way they are played in a typical stereo, where a listener might just let an album play on through the intended track.

The jukebox is quite cold in this regard– only the individual tracks matter. Jukeboxes are from another time, dance numbers, rock singles, and pop music… and that’s got to be the sort of thing that jukeboxes handle best as well. In a way, it makes my machine seem like some sort of unwieldly, impossible monster– saddled with the body of the compact disc, but the heart of a 45 record.

For some background info, New York Dolls, and the Clash were getting famous (or at least garnering notoriety), it inspired angry teenagers to start bands regardless of their musical abilities. What came was the hardcore and indie underground scene of the 80s that later progressed into 90s alternative. 

Key players in the movement were Black Flag, Minor Threat, The Germs, and the Minutemen. For the most part, the music of these bands was simple, aggressive, fast paced

Now, and punk in general, is about attitude, not music, and in turn, a lot of the music (albeit fun and sometimes catchy) is awful but put on a pedestal. 

What I want to discuss is this: I think bands that left the punk scene were better off as a whole. Bands that started off hardcore who evolved ended up much better than they were

The Replacements started as a hardcore band

Dinosaur Jr started off as a hardcore band called Deep Wound. Deep Wound sucks

The Flaming Lips started as a hardcore band and they were awful. Their 80s music is horrendous whereas their 90s material is incredible. 

The early Seattle scene was Green River, Nirvana's *Bleach* does not stack up to their later releases). when Green River and Malfunkshun broke up and later became Mudhoney and Mother Love Bone/Pearl Jam, they were SOO much better. 

I guess what I am rambling about is that I think bands who really stand out are the ones who don't necessarily ""sell out

I also have a suspicion that Fleet Foxes is becoming more and more like this with Robin Pecknold really asserting himself on their lastest record.

So what say you? Can you think of any more examples of this and reasons why?

The first band that springs to my mind is *Calexico*. Each of their songs tells a story and the lyrics make heavy use of metaphor -- particularly imagery in which the state of nature reflects the state of emotion of the ""protagonist"". Here, [Woven Birds](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZ3B3IuIoGA)\)

At the other end of the spectrum

There are some bands I enjoy listening to, necessarily, but the writing isn't really memorable for me. With *Mastodon*, the lyrics are clearly not the central focus of the music (although their latest album has, in my opinion, changed this in an interesting way). In most cases they are just a bundle of shouted thematic phrases awkwardly tossed together; the album Blood Mountain feels like their worst offender in this regard. But frequently that's precisely all that's needed to accompany the actual meat of the music \(example: [Hearts Alive](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vs2ZsxPMdL4) *lyrics start at 2:50*\)

So I am undecided about what makes good song-writing good. Does it just need to fit in with the rest of the music or should it be able to stand alone? A good story clearly helps but also doesn't seem to be at all necessary. Genre is probably the deciding factor here. For instance

The topic revolves around disliking certain pieces of music for reasons that never include actually listening to the songs themselves.

For example, screaming, etc from metal), or even the album covers without actually giving these songs a listen. 

So I later go back and do just that, the lyrics have the kind of substance that appeals to me, the way the song is sung and/or played also appeals to me as well - and so on.

**Question:**

How can one find the ""staple bands"" that DO outline their genres, and thus be able to form a reasonable opinion about it?

They're missing the point. This sort of missed opportunity/colossal fuck up is exactly what makes Van Halen the band they are. This is a band that has existed for 35 years and climbed the absolute highest heights of rock and roll fame without appearing to have a fucking clue what they were doing.  They are dysfunction personified. Sammy Hagar speaks of his years with the band in retrospect as if he survived some unspeakable natural disaster that unfolded in slow motion over the course of a decade.

To summarize





And there's a fucking a capella barbershop quartet style do-wop section. 



Right there in the middle of the song. 



There is no precursor to this on the rest of the album. The only moment of ""humor"" on the whole thing is the cover of Ice Cream Man a few tracks later.

There’s something you should know about me before we go any further. I am a Michael Jackson fan. And I don’t mean I know the Thriller dance. I had an entire library of Michael Jackson everything. I had records, VHS tapes, magazines, posters. Right now there is a life-size Michael Jackson cardboard cutout. It’s my most prized possession. 

My fascination with Michael came at an early age. I was in the fourth grade when I was introduced to Thriller. I immediately began listening to everything I could find of his. I seemed to discover Michael at the perfect time. He was everywhere at the moment. VH1 had a marathon and I recorded every minute of it. I spent the next year watching it repeatedly and memorizing nearly every song. His music helped me through what was mostly an awkward childhood. I didn’t have many friends at the time and his tunes let me escape. He understood what it felt like to be lonely and picked on. Say what you will about the man

Knowing this, we all knew who the star was. Justin stood out for his smooth voice and impressive dance skills. After the boy bands faded away, Justin stood out as a truly talented solo artist. Remind you of anyone? They are both also known for blurring racial lines with their flawless musical skills.

My question to the good people of this subreddit is, even though my favorite musical styles are still progressive rock and jazz fusion (amongst many others). Why do I listen to it? I enjoy the hearing the subtleties in the way the sound waves are manipulated. I think that the amount of control today's producers have in terms of customizing timbres is simply incredible. I am by no means promoting EDM as a replacement for any other style of music - they are all good in their own ways - I do believe that it does a tremendous job of playing on your emotions. House music induces a sense of euphoria and gets you amped up, trance and downtempo, ambient music can send you into a meditative state, and dubstep simply boggles the mind with its deep sub bass lines and complex syncopation.

This served to reinvigorate song writing as a method of record keeping because Dylan could record how people felt as well as what actually occured.

As a kid, and *The Beatles - Sgt. Pepper* (really though, I was listening to the entire Beatles catalog, but Sgt. Pepper was the one I always begged my parents to play).  Like most kids, I didn't mind the endless repetition; to the contrary, I craved it!  Kids are like that, once they find something that's good, these records taught me to appreciate the immediacy of pure pop hooks.  I could listen to other songs and enjoy them

This changed when I was in Jr. High, nobody talked about their parents records, they talked about what was playing on the radio.  Moreover, they were all listen to *opposing* stations, these encampments of taste that defined to some extent who you were.  Some kids listened to the pop/rap station, others the alt-rock station.  I decided to align myself with the alt-rock station, during what was quite possibly **the worst era of alt-rock radio**.  For the most part, and while some better 90's bands like Green Day and Smashing Pumpkins were still popular, just to be able to fit in.  Looking back retrospectively

It was in high school that I finally began exploring music through the internet.  However, trying to find my clique.  For the first two years of high school, I was in my pop-punk/emo phase, listening to bands like Saves the Day, Taking Back Sunday, At the Drive-In, Rufio, using internet resources like IRC servers, but I should add that pop-punk as a genre really did provide a satisfying experience at the time.  Not only were the hooks there (if we're talking about the right band, or headbanging in a pit

The latter half of high school for me was all about letting go of the social dimension of music, and while I never really attempted to be a part of that, I did allow them to turn me on to a lot of classic rock that I hadn't previously heard.  Pink Floyd and Led Zeppelin weren't news to most people, but they were to me, so exploring them was a much more personal experience.  Drugs also helped me to internalize music in a way I had never previously experienced.  I was no longer listening for the hooks, or for the sake of being a part of a larger movement.  Now, I was listening for the sake of personal reflection

During this time, because I don't really listen to any metal anymore, and true metalheads tend to be extremely purist.  However, metal was the first genre that I really explored for my own personal satisfaction, and doing so taught me a lot about how to appreciate different aspects of music.  I listened to melodic death metal and power metal for the virtuosity, orchestral metal for the arrangement and scope, doom metal for the texture, black metal for the pure abrasiveness

After high school, in earnest.  Indie, blues, jazz, electronic, folk, shoegaze, you name it.  It was all at my fingertips

Flash forward about 10 years and 180GB of music, I think the unbridled access to music has spoiled me a little bit.  It's becoming increasingly difficult to appreciate an artist's innovation;  I feel like I've heard it all before.  It's also becoming more difficult to really connect personally to a song's lyrics or emotions, it's like I've gone numb to music's affective power.  Is this just me getting older?  Am I just having some sort of quarter-life crisis, if such a thing exists?  I don't know, but I guess I'll keep on trekking, and hopefully I'll find something that really moves me again.  Currently, I've been trying to devote some focused listening time to jazz and classical, maybe some of my capacity for music appreciation will return.  Only time will tell.

More generally though, in How Music Works, David Byrne talks about one of the things that made Frank Sinatra so interesting and unique at the time was the way he recorded the vocals so that they were much more close and intimate compared to the rest of the instruments, giving the effect that he was talking or even whispering directly to the listener, an effect which could not be done to the same effect in a live setting.

I've mentioned some of the essays I wrote during that class and have had requests to post them so I will start doing that.  **I don't claim to be a great writer**

_____________________________

Kvlt in the Cascades

Musical genres have often been known to grow in specific scenes and styles based on location, at post-rock in Montreal, or Seattle’s acoustic revival beginning in the late 90’s.  Black metal has always been a genre reliant on location, Scandinavian bands always finding more success than American bands, or the bands in the bracing cold of the north capturing the ideas of black metal more successfully than those in the bright and noisy cities.  However, in the past decade a new progression of black metal has arisen that is based entirely on a bioregion: Cascadia, of the Pacific Northwest.  Defined by some as any black metal influenced projects coming out of the region, the genre has remained vague and unfocused

Black metal first branched off from conventional heavy metal in the late 1980s.  It was marked by speed, shrieked vocals, and tremolo picked guitars.  It was focused solely on being harsher, more abrasive, and more extreme than any other metal before it. But in the early 1990’s on the Scandinavian Peninsula, mostly in Norway, black metal developed a more unique and recognizable sound, Mayhem, Burzum (the solo project of Varg Vikernes of Mayhem), and the darkness

Crime, Varg Vikernes, also known as “Count Grishnackh,” set fire to a church in his hometown.  In 24 hours he’d set a second ablaze.  Sometime later he set fire to a third.  He’d left no evidence and the only witnesses were the three different band mates he’d perpetrated the three different crimes with.  However, in 1993, tensions in the band grew, and eventually lead to Vikernes murdering Mayhem guitarist “Euronymous.”  Vikernes was arrested and, other members of Mayhem offered their eyewitness accounts of the church arsons, of which he served 16.  Over the first ten years of his sentence a number of albums he had recorded for Burzum during 1991 and 1992 were intermittently released and supplied some context for his anti-Christian stance and crimes.  While the worldwide media had covered his trial calling him a Satanist

On top of this he preached, sexist, and national socialist worldview.  His life authentically reflected the hate in his music, and Europe generally reacted against this by shunning the genre of black metal.  It still exists there today, especially in Scandinavia, but is not a generally accepted form of music and is still a great source of controversy, especially in Germany, regardless of the individual beliefs of the musicians involved.

In the US, bands attempt to recreate the cold emptiness of European black metal, yet the genre’s success is in debate.  Many claim that black metal can’t be created in a city, the center for much of the US music scenes, and must be inspired by the cold, open north.  The scene carries over the corpsepaint and the general aesthetic of its European counterpart, and doing its best to anger the religious in America.  The motivation for this has less of a holding than in Vikernes’ ex-Pagan nation.  America has no past of worship, at least of its whites, if it abandoned these Pagan and anti-Christian points of view

Inspired by an Earth First meet-up in the Cascade Mountains during the summer of 2002, Washington.  It was here, during the cold and grey winter that followed, they acted upon the inspiration from the festival in the woods that night.  By combining an environmentally conscious worldview with the cold and aggressive sound of Norwegian atmospheric black metal, Wolves in the Throne Room was born.  In 2006, they debuted their sound with *Diadem of 12 Stars*, and one year later perfected the approach with *Two Hunters*.  Their lyrics were devoid of the hate and anti-Christian themes of most black metal, they were often characterized as an inauthentic black metal group who were in no way, except by the corpse paint wearing black metal bands of the early 1990’s). At the same time, dubbed Cascadian black metal

The most distinctive part of Cascadian black metal is its sound.  It takes queues from atmospheric black metal and neofolk, fast and relentless.  Songs tend to be long—usually passing the ten minutes mark and sometimes the twenty—and follow the structure of most black metal: a continuous and changing composition rather than a repeated chorus or distinct verses.  The guitars are not tuned down, and often only played on the higher strings, strumming as fast as possible to create a driving, droning effect.  The screams are higher as well, in opposition to the guttural croaks of death and doom metal. As Cascadian metal is also atmospheric black metal, its intent is to create an atmosphere for the listener rather than pummel the listener with the intense drumming and fast guitars—beauty above brutality.  Here is one border, apart from lyrics and messages.  

Agalloch, is occasionally grouped into the definition of Cascadian black metal.  Many lyrical themes are the same: Agalloch often sings of worshipping nature, of reclaiming pagan roots, one example is in their song “In the Shadow of Our Pale Companion,” in which the lyrics exclaim “Here I gaze upon a pantheon of oak, a citadel of stone.  If this grand panorama before me is what you call God, then God is not dead.”  Yet, with acoustic guitars, and, for example
	Some bands, recording every sound and never looping, not using drum triggers during live sets and never using a drum machine.  In fact, Wolves In the Throne Room are against the use of computers in music making.  Their music is recorded using completely analog technology and techniques, and it is mixed on a soundboard rather than on a computer.  Some critics see this as an attempt to be “natural,” and mock the irony of the situation.  Wolves in the Throne Room recognizes this hypocrisy, stating:

&gt;“One of the many contradictions of Black Metal is that it is a music that decries civilization, confusion, being 	caught between two worlds that cannot be reconciled”.

This recording technique is used to give warmth to a style of music so consistently straining for the cold of winter.  As is later explained in the previously quoted interview:

&gt;“True Norwegian black metal is completely unbalanced – that is why it is so compelling and powerful.  It is the sound of utter torment, for it is a crucial metaphor 	that reveals our sadness and woe as a race.  In our hubris, we have rejected the earth and 	the wisdom of countless generations for the baubles of modernity.  In return, we have 	been left stranded and bereft in this spiritually freezing hell”.

The band though, and recognizes through their music the power of nature in all seasons.  But Cascadian black metal faces this paradox, described in the first quote, as well.  The music created is in reaction to our rejection of the “earth and the wisdom of countless generations for the baubles of modernity,” but it uses these products of the modern world, the electric guitars and the effects pedals and the amplifiers and it finds it self caught in the same to opposing worldviews as traditional black metal does.  The pain apparent in the music is caused by the fact that these musicians are being forced to accept this modern world and long hopelessly for the past.

By intellectually dry, hidden signals such as references to the span of a single life in Kid A. They never concern emotional appreciation, or impressionistic awe. For example it's never the thrilling primal energy that people appreciate about Tool, or the affecting sadness or Radiohead's. It's their convoluted 'deeper' patterns or meanings that often turn out to be nonexistent, arbitrary or conceited.

Almost always the artist concerned is supposed ""thinking man's music"" such as Radiohead or Tool, educated males. No one ever looked for deeper patterns or meaning in Outkast, Johnny Cash or Apparat other than the colour, movement, flavour and emotional intensity of the music, or the directly apparent literary meaning of the lyrics.

My friend, he believes an artist's metaphors are limited in the same way poetry is limited.  

I concede that film has more ""mediums, sonic, etc, whereas music is limited to only sonic.  

However

I've given D a few examples.  For instance: 

Radiohead's albums tend to be circular.  Kid A starts off (arguably) at the conception of a child.  The last song ends with the lyrics ""I will see you in the next life.""  The album is born

In Rainbows works similarly.  The first line of 15 Step is ""How come I end up where I started.""  Videotape, and only after selling his soul to the devil does he realize how he had happiness the whole time.  It's very circular - you search for happiness, you find it, and then its fleeting and evades you once again.  ""How come I end up where I started?""  Even the idea of a videotape - something that goes round and round ties into this notion of circular motion and circular thinking.  

These are just two examples.  I'd really like to hear your thoughts on this debate.

The first response pains me to no end because it also implies that alternative rock didn't really exist since the sound was mainstream by the mid-90s, but the second one has a fair bit of weight to it in my mind.

I'm also curious about variety. Do you listen to one band or genre at a time? Full albums or just songs? Do you repeat listen to your favorites

Personally I go through maybe 5 albums a day. When I'm listening on my computer, and one is something I haven't heard in months or years. There's usually a logic to my day's list; for instance today I'm listening to experimental rock from the late 70s so I've got This Heat, The Durutti Column, and Can, the latter of whom I gave a lot of time two years ago but never loved so I figure they need a retrial.

Once I've decided I love someone they go on my iPod. When I'm running or driving I only want my favorites. Only listening to them while exercising also motivates me to get out.

For example, would it necessarily be a better song?

**Part 1: Songs Selling Stuff**  
This was all sparked by an [opinion piece in The Guardian](http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/aug/12/beastie-boy-role-node-rock-stars) that brings up the following and more: 
  
* Beastie Boy Adam Yauch stipulating in his will that none of his music can be used for advertising purposes. 
  
* British Airways using The Clash's 'London Calling' in an Olympics ad.  
  
* John Lyndon from The Sex Pistols hocking butter on the TV.  
  
* Converse resurrecting Ian Curtis and plonking him in a pair of Chucks.  
  
A couple more conflicting opinions I've noticed in recent times:  
  
* Ed Droste (Grizzy Bear) saying [he doesn't care if The Shins are in a McDonald's commercial](http://www.fasterlouder.com.au/features/33221/Grizzly-Bear-I-dont-care-that-The-Shins-did-a-McDonalds-commercial?page=2).  (Starts halfway down
  
* Volkswagen approached Beach House about using a track for a car ad. Beach House declined because they didn't feel VW's ad was a good fit for the song. VW then made the ad anyway with an [obvious soundalike ripoff](http://stereogum.com/1035911/does-this-volkswagen-ad-rip-off-beach-house/video/).  
  
* Ezra Koenig (Vampire Weekend) and The Black Keys appearing on The Colbert Report to make fun of themselves in a [battle of the sell-outs](http://www.funnyordie.com/articles/7c03f375d1/colbert-welcomes-the-black-keys-and-vampire-weekend-for-a-sell-out-off).  
  
**Part 2: Cool By Association**  
This is where it gets a little grey.  
  
* Converse's three artist/one song series
  
* Anecdotal: a local community radio station devoted a long segment to a pre-recorded package of an iterview with Dan Bejar (The New Pornographers
  
* Converse, and probably never will be, commercially successful. I signed up for a ticket. 
  
**My Questions To You:**  
  
* It's pretty well known that nobody makes money from music like they used to. Do you see attaching a brand to a band as an inevitable annoyance? A sign that a band has made it? A complete cheapening of their art? An otherwise irrelevant business move?
