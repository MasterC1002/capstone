* Give enough time for people to proofread your work. I'd say at least a week before a paper is due
* If you're not sure of something
* Proofread it yourself before submitting it here! I know that a second or third set of eyes picks up things you missed
* When you submit your work, Blue Book, etc. (thanks to sheerheartattack!)
* If you wish to retain your anonymity, professor, etc. (thanks to sheerheartattack [again]!)
* If correcting a Word document

**Ways to submit what you need read:**

* Post the content of what you need proofed in a self post. Obviously
* Use **Google Docs** and either link directly to that or link to it in a self post.
* Use an uploading service like megaupload or rapidshare to upload your document and post the link in a self post.
* Post that you'd like help with your email address (or instructions to PM you to get an email address). Then you can just finish things up over email.

To whom it may concern

Dear fellow book lovers

Seeing your ad on Craigslist today was serendipitous. Earlier this afternoon, or running an organic bed and breakfast.

I have been working in a small, and potentially owning, a small business of my own.  I have an excellent rapport with all of our customers.  About 80% of our daily clientele are regulars who come in 3 - 5 times a week. I know them all by name, and they know mine.  I am experienced in settling a till at the end of the day. I have been responsible for hiring and training new employees. I take care of inventory and ordering, and have taken on and mastered any challenge put before me. I have become accustomed to a busy and demanding work atmosphere where I am constantly on the move, multitasking, and finding creative ways to solve problems. The owner leaves town on a regular basis, coming up with and preparing a variety of daily specials

The skills I have learned at the cafe are ones that are important to any job. This combined with my great love of books would make me a unique candidate for this job. My mother was a literature teacher during my childhood

If I were able to choose my top ten favorite books, Norwegian Wood by Haruki Murakami, The Satanic Verses by Salman Rushdie, Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close by Jonathan Safran Foer, Time Enough For Love by Robert A. Heinlein, Infinite Jest by DFW, The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier and Clay by Michael Chabon, and Life of Pi by Yann Martel! Clearly

Working in a book store would be like a dream for me.  To be surrounded by books, and don't have any problem making a full-time, long term commitment. 

I hope to have the opportunity to speak with you soon about your store and what I could contribute.
My email address is ...

Thank you in advance!

**First Draft**

Experiences are what make us who we are. The experiences we have teach us our values and customs. I believe that the experiences I had have prepared me for the affairs that will come my way. One program I would like to be a part of is University of North Florida’s Honors Program. I believe that I will benefit from the program through the exclusive classes available to Honors Students and the duties that will be presented to me. I believe that I will make a quality addition to UNF’s Honors Program for the following reasons. 

One of the most fulfilling experiences I’ve had so far was when I volunteered as Technical Director for my high school’s drama program. The Technical Director has duties such as keeping schedules, I oversaw everything during production that was behind the scenes. I motivated and assigned people to projects. Being able to manage these people effectively to fit our tight schedule took leadership. I also gained practice in teamwork by helping crews accomplish tasks such as building a platform, painting a set piece, or ironing costumes. 

As Technical Director, but we needed at least $150 worth of lumber. I found a local lumber dealer and made an arrangement that he would trade us some lumber for ad space in our play’s program. There was also an issue where our costume mistress was threatening to quit the production and take all of the male costumes she made home with her. I presented at the parent booster meeting our need for donations, and even though our costume mistress didn’t leave, we received enough donations to add another costume change between scenes. 

A successful person starts any job, or resolution with determination, devotion, and a sense of enthusiasm. This can be reflected in my academic experiences at UNF. After I toured the campus with my father in August of 2010, I heard that there was a deadline about 2 weeks later to have my application reviewed and find out if I was accepted the following October. I gathered what I needed and ordered my transcripts by the application deadline. On October 2nd, I received my admission decision, I had been invited to start the upcoming summer, I could change my start date to the fall instead. I finished my first semester of my Senior Year with six As and one B. This improvement allowed me to change my start date to the fall
This determination still hasn’t faltered now that I am actually taking college level classes. I completed my first semester with a 3.7 GPA. My enthusiasm hasn’t faded either. It’s the beginning of my second semester and I walk into every class eager to learn what my professor has to offer next. I look forward to the classes that I will take next fall

I recently declared my major in Health Administration. Before declaring, but didn’t know how to without taking up nursing. My mother was diagnosed with invasive breast cancer September 2009. I wouldn’t be able to count the number of times I witnessed her experiences with the health care system. I realized that there was someone behind the hospital and insurance companies that helped my mom gain her health back, and I decided that that’s the job I want. My dream job would to become a Hospital Administrator. I want to be able to manage doctors and procedures most effectively to provide a comfortable experience for patients on their road to recovery. To reach my goals, I look forward to completing internships that will let me apply skills to a job I want to make a career. I also have applied to live in the Brooks College of Health Living Learning Community for next school year. Through the living learning community, I hope to meet professionals in my field who will give me insight and advice for my advancement. I will also be in pursuit of a Leadership Certificate from the Institute of Values from UNF. I have not taken Introduction to Leadership yet, but plan to this coming fall to begin my documentation of all my leadership experiences.  

University of North Florida’s Honors Program will help me polish and develop the skills I have and I expect to learn additional talents also. I am an earnest applicant who wants to grow and develop within my university. The experiences and goals I’ve written about show why I would make a good asset to the program. Lydia Maria Child, “Belief in oneself is one of the most important bricks in building any successful venture.” I believe in myself, and I know that I will prosper at University of North Florida, and will prosper in University of North Florida’s Honors Program.

Dear Dean of Admissions

I would like to challenge my test score, that time being I was denied. I feel I was denied from this class in 2010 because of the hastily written letter I wrote you. I can assure you that that letter did not properly reflect my writing, spelling or grammar* abilities. I was quickly trying to fill out the form so I would not miss out on this class. If you look at my high school transcript you will see that I got “A's” every year in English, and that my college assignment test score was not a low one either; I was only 0.5 points off, or so I was told. I hope you will reconsider and let me enter English 1A so I can continue on with my goals of getting my associates degree, here at [Blah blah College]. Thank you for your time.

Sincerely

My high school years have been an adventure filled with lots of ups and downs. The difference between the start of my freshman year and now is simply astounding. It is crazy to think how many changes I have gone through in such a short time, I had terrible hygiene in school that year I hardly ever showered or changed my clothes and I wore my glasses to make it even worse. It was not a good start to my freshman year in hindsight. I decided I wanted to a good GPA and to take a difficult course load so I took my core classes as honors, which was just about all you could do as a freshman. I was a very serious kid in my freshman year and I'm sure I was not that much fun back then. I decided against taking my two required language classes this year and I really regret doing that. I also had a look into my future with electronics because in that class there were computers with games on them and instead of working I just spent my time playing games and I came the closest I have ever come to failing a class in my school career. I also had my favorite teacher ever freshman year, Mr. Allegado was my ninth grade science teacher and that was by far my favorite class to take.  Mr. Allegado made the class fun and I had a lot of fun learning science from him. Freshman year was fun but it was only the first step in my high school journey.
	Moving on to sophomore year, I even got new contacts and ditched the glasses I was much more confident this year. I started my 2 years of French this year and it was absolutely terrible, I have a very bad memory and the language was very hard to learn, as of writing this right now I still can't speak any full sentences but I passed so that is all that matters. I started out the year with a good science teacher he was also my advisory teacher, then something happened with the teachers and he had to go teach at a different school which left me without a science teacher or advisor. My new advisory teacher was awful I don't remember his name but he was unnecessarily rude and told a lot of stories and got mad if you talked during them, luckily I only had him for this year. My new science teacher was a freshman teacher that they just boosted up she had never taught the subject of biology and if you don't know what you are teaching you are not going to be able to teach it. I took Web design as one of my electives, it was my first computer elective and I thought I might want to go into it when I got older, little did I know it was just a bunch of memorizing symbols and typing, everything I am terrible at
	I started junior year and was already tired of school a week in, there was no grades for classwork whatsoever so all I had to do good on was the tests, there was also a minimum of fifty percent I could get on the tests, so even if I bombed a few I would still pass, I sat at the back of the classroom for the entire year and stared at my phone my teacher knew but he had been teaching for long enough that he just didn't care. I did the same in Physics class but not quite as extreme, I did have to do some classwork and I paid attention some but it was pretty crazy how much time I spent staring straight down in those two classes combined. Physics was probably the hardest class I have taken but I'm good at science so it was alright I really regret not taking chemistry though, because was a junior in a sea of seniors. It was the complete opposite of my French class that I was struggling to get through, this was his last year of teaching and he just didn't care anymore, is what we worked on. French was still terrible but I had a lot of fun in there too I couldn't speak French so it was very hard to pass that class but I did it. This was the year I was supposed to the junior project, which was very nice. Last but not least I took gym again and it was by far my favorite part of the day.
	If I thought I was lazy junior year I went to a whole new level senior year. I had no more math or science classes so I didn't really have any homework heavy classes which I am very thankful for because I definitely wouldn't have ever done it. I had to take al of my art credits this year because I hadn't taken them in any of my other years, I learned from my previous years to not take difficult electives so I had a lot of easy ones. I took gym which is still my favorite class by far and I really do regret not taking it during my sophomore year. I took two art classes ceramics is one which I enjoy because it is not very hard, but I am terrible at art so I also do not do very good in it. I took printmaking which is probably my least favorite class I have ever taken, the teacher was very rude to all the students and it was just so repetitive and boring. For my last elective I took business which has been very fun thus far, I am very good at presentations and that is what they are most of the time. For my Current world issues class I went from a terrible teacher that was bored out of his mind to the opposite of the spectrum, Mr. Veliz who is basically the complete opposite of that he always talked about how he didn't want to be one of those teachers that just made handouts which is basically what my social studies teacher had been doing all year, the class was difficult but it was a refreshing change from the boredom of last year. After I took my one semester of current world issues I had an extra slot for a class so I took astro/geo which is taught by my favorite teacher Mr. Allegado. It has been very fun so far just like I remembered it from freshman year. I took the SATs and did beastly on them luckily because I would have been in serious trouble if I didn't because my class load wasn't exactly that difficult and my GPA was nothing to be proud of. I then got accepted to Washington State University so in the end everything worked out in the end. Now hopefully I can just graduate on time and have some smooth sailing. 
	In conclusion I have changed so much from freshman year it is pretty insane to think we were the same person. I made a life decision half way between my high school years and I am very happy with it. I decided that life to me at least is all about happiness, my GPA for all 4 years of high school only mattered for one decision and now that that decision is over I am on a level playing field with everyone else, the only difference between me and most people is I had way more fun doing it. To me school isn't about what you learned it is all about preparing you for your life and showing you how to live it. I can say with certainty that I am way more prepared for life now then I was four years ago and that is true success.

Joseph Conrad's Heart of Darkness is set in the 1890s during Europe's colonization of Africa. Conrad contrasts characters, but the Manager only wants to triumph over Kurtz and keep his position in the Company safe. The Congo affects the Central Station Manager and Charles Marlow in opposing fashions; the Station Manager experiences no transformation and Marlow is profoundly influenced by his time in the jungle. 
	
Marlow takes time from being a sailor to become the captain of a steamboat in the Congo and search for new mysteries in the world. He anticipates adventure and further enlightenment, and therefore different from the other Europeans working for the Company who are influenced by the scientific philosophy  Both philosophies deny the existence of real mystery, and put man in touch with ideas which are simpler than the truth.  Civilization and science created limits and ideas of what was true in an attempt to allow control in the world, however when the Europeans are placed into an anti environment none of them seem to see the consequences of their actions.  Science defined things as if their embodiment in time didn't exist, however in the Congo light and dark are in flux and have different meanings depending on their context. These ideas the Europeans misconcieve as truths cause the supposed missionaries of light to inflict irreversible damage to Africa due to the ignorance and hollowness that comes with the 'enlightened' world. Marlow says they were ""killing out of ignorance,(were)greedy without voracity, (and) cruel without courage""(21).The Company saw themselves as enlightened people simply because they came from a 'later' time. Science and romanticism conditioned men to see things without the existence of time. The Congo is a place where neither science nor romanticism live. It is impossible to hold on to romanticism because it is such a sensual and dark place,  he has travelled to the ""Indian Ocean, Marlow had to change his idea of what a country was.  Marlow is aware of the amazing reality of concealed life in the Congo,mute while the man jabbered about himself. I wondered whether the stillness on the face of the immensity looking at us two was meant as an appeal or as a menace. Could we handle that dumb thing or would it handle us. I felt how confoundedly big was that thing that couldn't talk and perhaps was dumb as well""(32).    

Marlow is the one character that the reader sees in and outside of Africa, and says ""They were no colonists; their administration was merely a squeeze, and noting more i suspect. They were conquerers, and for that you only want brute force""(6).  Marlow at this point in Heart of Darkness believes himself free of romanticism, however as he is recalling his adventure, the same ""overcast sky (that) seemed to lead into the heart of an immense darkness"" that loomed over London at the beginning of the tale now hangs over the Nellie and Marlow. The symbolism of this scene suggests that Marlow's enlightenment may not yet be complete unbeknownst to himself.  The original narrator of Heart of Darkness is one of Marlow's friends listening to his story, and they seem to disregard the knowledge he is trying to pass to them. He begins by claiming England was ""also(…) one of the dark places on earth""(5), enveloping the tale which brought it out only as a glow brings out a haze

Kurtz's reaction to the Congo is similar to the way Marlow feels after his relatively short stay. He appeals to Marlow progressively more throughout his journey through the congo, imitating the amorality of the Congo to gain followers that adored and worshipped him.  Kurtz had ""travelled into the first ages of man by way of solitude- untrammelled without the restraining influence of policeman, butcher and neighbours""(60).  Marlow feels what Kurtz felt, and is tempted to join the native ritual the night before they leave the Inner Station. The Congo is so different from Europe that it makes Marlow feel what primitive man must have felt; one among animals. Kurtz became a fanatical being after his prolonged exposure to the Congo; he created himself with his gift of expression but his words betrayed him, and he used his talent to deceive people instead of using it for good. After Kurtz passes away on the steamer, Marlow is deeply affected by the death of Kurtz and has a slight understanding of the evil that possessed the man. If Marlow had not met Kurtz and became a more integral member of the Company, it is likely that he could have been plagued with the same fanaticism and insanity that corrupted Kurtz.
	
The Central Station Manager is the embodiment of the falsely enlightened European movement and a foil of Kurtz. He repulses Marlow simply because he is a low example of what men can achieve. The manager contrasts with Kurtz as a hollow man with no accountability or compassion, this is similar to Kurtz's behaviour in the Congo except that ultimately the Managers Uncle cares only for himself and his men whereas Kurtz feels deeply connected to the natives in the Congo. Marlow is shocked when the uncle of the Manager makes a ""dishonouring flourish and a black display of confidence-a treacherous appeal to the lurking death, the hidden evil, the profound darkness"" of the heart of the wilderness, telling his nephew ""Ah! my boy, trust to this""(40). The Manager is an Apollonian character, and like the Europeans he mistakes the Congo for his homeland. He feels enlightened because he comes from a more civilized time yet  he understands little about the affect the Congo can have on people.  Marlow says on the way to the inner station that "" You thought yourself bewitched and cut off forever from everything you had known once-somewhere-far away-in another existence perhaps.  The Manager is not affected by the Congo physically or mentally because he is so removed from everything that he has no convictions or beliefs. He is surprisingly resilient to sickness Similar to Kurtz he is able to control people, ""He is a prodigy (…) He is an emissary of pity, only arrogance.  After leaving the inner station Marlow reflects  ""the manager was very placid, numbered with the dead""(69). The only purpose the Manager had was to eliminate the threat of Kurtz taking his job in the Company

The Europeans have travelled to another world in the Africa and are ignorant to their lack of integrity or remorse. Just as the Station Manager is unaffected by his time in the Congo, even Marlow is unable to completely free himself from his conditioning and ideologies he uncovers in the Congo. When he speaks to the Intended, it is revealed again that Marlow is a disillusioned romantic still polluted with the ideas that led to inhuman conquering of Africa in the first place.

	Every time you turn on the lights, or flip the channel on your TV, you are using one of Nicola Tesla’s great contributions to the scientific world. Alternating Current, or better know as AC, is what Tesla is best known for, and AC electricity has transformed the electrical world. Despite many trials and tribulations, AC electricity is arguably one of the most used inventions today. AC electricity, is the legacy that Tesla left behind.
	Nicola Tesla was born on July 10th, Austria-Hungary. His father was a Serbian Orthodox Priest and his mother was an inventor of simple household appliances (Tesla’s). Tesla’s childhood dream was to move to the United States in order to harness the power of the Niagara Falls. Perhaps this dream is what caused Tesla to get into engineering, as Tesla moved to Budapest and took his first electrical engineering job in 1881 (Tesla’s). During his time there, Tesla came up with the concept of AC electricity, as DC power was so inefficient, and proposed his idea to a company in France and another in Germany (Tesla’s). The companies were interested but would not bite on the idea. In 1984, Tesla decided to work with Edison and moved to New York
	Direct Current electricity was introduced to New York in 1870. Edison’s incandescent light bulbs were an object of fascination for the public
Yorkers quickly had electricity installed at home. DC electricity was incredibly inefficient and ultimately very dangerous. The current can only be carried a maximum of two miles and only in one direction (School). Poles carrying exposed wires were frequently climbed by unsuspecting children who were often shocked and sent tumbling 
										Curtis 3
down toward the concrete of the New York streets (PBS). Pedestrians in Brooklyn became so used to “dodging” the shocks sent off by DC powered trolley cars that they named their baseball team after them; the Brooklyn Dodgers. Ultimately
	While working with Edison in New York, purchased them for 60,000 dollars and 150 shares in Westinghouse electricity (PBS). This caused an all out war of AC versus DC in which Edison used dirty tactics, such as spreading false lies and doing street demonstrations of his own DC and calling it AC, in order to undermine the Westinghouse company. This quote by Tesla illustrates his thought on the matter.
	“Fights between individuals, not 	so much in their own, as in their mutual fields. The peril of a clash is aggravated 	by a more or less predominant sense of combativeness, posed by every human 	being. To resist this inherent fighting tendency the best way is to dispel ignorance 		of the doings of others by a systematic spread of general knowledge. With this 	object in view, it is most important to aid exchange of thought and intercourse.” 	― Nikola Tesla.
This attitude portrayed in this quote toward the conflict with Edison aided Tesla in that he 
										Curtis 4
was able to keep a calm, he went about combatting Tesla in a less then ethical way, and scarred his illustrious career in the electrical field. Ultimately, Alternating current won out because it was simply the superior technology. 
	With alternating current winning out
	Nikola Tesla died in a New York City hotel room during the morning of January 8th, Tesla had proposed to the United States War department his idea for a plasma cannon, or “death ray” as many called it. As soon as he died, the Office of Alien Property was contacted, despite him being a full citizen of the United States, and all of his possessions were seized and declared “Top Secret.” According to records released, there were approximately 80 truckloads of experimental plans and notes (B92).
	Even though DC electricity is still used today in things such as flashlights and solar powered homes
										Curtis 5
in flashlights, being Tesla’s greatest contribution, is what he is best known for. Wiping out DC electricity is a fantastic contribution to the electrical world. However, Tesla also came up with a few other great inventions.
	In 1901, Tesla waited for night to arrive before he ordered his assistant to turn on the Tesla coil. When he did, the night lit up with man created lightning that created a bluish hue to the night. This confirmed Tesla’s theory that the air could be used as a conductor. His ambitions were later captured in a quote from an article he wrote for Wireless Telephony magazine (Belows). 
	""As soon as completed, from his desk, and talk to any telephone subscriber on the globe, without any change whatever in the existing equipment. An inexpensive instrument, not bigger than a watch, will enable its bearer to hear anywhere, on sea or land, the speech of a political leader, however distant. In the same manner any picture
										Curtis 6
from one to another place. Millions of such instruments can be operated from but one plant of this kind. More important than all of this, without wires, which will be shown on a scale large enough to carry conviction.""
Tesla’s ideas on wireless energy sparked many theories to come about in harnessing this newfound energy. The first idea to be realized was wireless telegraphy by a machine invented by Guglielmo Marconi
	Tesla contributed heavily towards the invention of the X-rays we use today for medical examinations. Tesla heavily researched electromagnetism and practically every radiologist today is aware of what he contributed. Tesla did not invent the X-ray
	Tesla also invented the electric motor. The Tesla car company has popularized the motor and many American’s have used Tesla’s invention in their daily lives since it was invented. Industrial fans, but his invention still stretches into our daily lives everywhere (West).
 	Modern war today can thank Tesla for his contributions as well. In contrast
										Curtis 7
invention of a remote controlled boat was the first of its kind. Every time you play with remote control cars, drones piloted using a remote control can make pinpoint turns, drop bombs, fire missiles, and shoot heavy machine guns with precision accuracy without a human pilot. 
	For many years, but was never awarded for them.  Marconi on the other hand, was awarded the patents in 1904. Marconi’s financial backers, Thomas Alva Edison and Andrew Carnegie, potentially influenced this decision.  If the patents were awarded to Marconi, the United States wasn’t going to have to pay royalties to Tesla (West).  
	Millions of people, militaries across the world have used it since World War I.  This is just another one of the many legacy’s that Tesla left behind. 
	Every day, whether it

1344891138.0,y5wzc,Look over my college essay?,princealice,7,2,3,"So I'm going into my senior year and will be attending my schools ""College  Essay Boot Camp"" in a few days

Edit: The prompt was ""topic of your choice""

&gt;Running Away to Join the Circus

&gt;At circus camp, but into our daily lives even after we have left camp for the year. We first hear it during stretching, as we wince our way further into a split. It follows us through the four disciplines, as our aerials and acrobatics coaches encourage us to push our limits physically, and our juggling and performance coaches coax even the most painfully shy campers to stand in front of their peers. It’s the first thing we remind ourselves of in the morning as we strain our exhausted muscles into rolling out of bed, and the last thing we think of as we try and sleep on a spot that’s not bruised at night. And it’s what I repeat to myself as I say goodbye to my beloved circus every year and try to hold back my tears.

&gt;And soon, the ability to do things I had only ever dreamed of. During the year, whether I’m hunched over my desk trying to perfect my college essay as the sun rises or I’ve messed up my lines in one of our performances for the fifth time that day, I remember that, just like in circus, in order to achieve anything you have to push through what is holding you back.

&gt;One third of the way through my junior year, I was hospitalized with mysterious but excruciating stomach pain. This was obviously nothing like the soreness I would experience after a hard day’s work at the circus, and in this situation “pushing through” and trying to ignore the pain would do more harm than good. Therefore, for the three weeks between Thanksgiving and Christmas, I was able to attend school only sporadically, often times having to leave in the middle of the day. As this was the start of a new grading term, when I returned in better health after Christmas I had a lot of catching up to do. Not only had I missed the vital few “first draft” weeks of my research paper, especially in my math class. Now this was a situation where I could apply what I had learned from my coaches. I knew it wasn't going to be easy, but had also endowed me with abilities that would continue to serve me even after I had left for the year.

&gt;On the night of our final show, there seems to be one common thread; Smirkus Camp is a place unlike any other. We are brought together not only by our love of the circus arts, but our dedication to supporting each other and improving alongside our friends. It’s a place where anyone can – and does – belong. We gather from New York, California, Hawaii, and spend a far too brief two weeks together, and all of us are changed and strengthened by the experience.

&gt;And so now, and that although the soreness and bruises of camp may fade, the experiences I have had and shared will remain with me forever.

SPEECH-----------------------------------------------------

When speaking of the NASA budget, it is extensively dangerous, and that it would use an excessive amount of necessary resources. These arguments are partly true; however, a large majority of scientists agree that manned space exploration would bring about improved technology, improved communication, and most importantly, bring us closer to colonizing a planet.

Currently, and its overall funding from its creation in 1958 to 2010 is less than the 2010 budget of the military, which was approximately $693 billion. For the United States, funding is a non-issue. A manned mission to Mars would cost nearly $300 billion over the course of two years with current inefficient technologies.    

Mars is the next logical step in the United States space program. Realistically, and an amount of risks far outnumbering Earth’s explorers. However, through an exploration like this, cosmonauts begin to have experiences of not only long-distance exploration, but surviving, and possibly thriving outside of our home-planet for great quantities of time. Mars is complete with polar icecaps, river valleys, mostly, which would be supplied by ample amounts of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gasses to help make Mars’ thin atmosphere thick

These courageous and necessary steps in manned spaceflight will also bring about a new generation of inspired scientists, cosmic radiation, and the limited mobility of astronauts, whilst advertising would showcase the need for an ever-expanding sufficient amount of innovative technology, which naturally include discovering alternative fuels and resources.  

Carl Sagan said, one day, venture to the stars.” Travelling the universe is a passion shared by only those who are aware of the possibilities, near-light-speed travel due to highly developed technology, increasing our chances of viewing extrasolar planets, many of which may hold life or be hospitable for further expansion, or possibly even VY-Canis Majoris, nearly five thousand light years away, with support from the people and politicians

Here's what the assignment is asking:

------------

A comparative literary essay attempts to point out meaningful connections between texts - a similar theme treated differently, etc. - otherwise it is identical to a regular literary essay. Choose one of the theses below and argue it with support from textual evidence. Remember, literary essays are formal in tone. The paper should be between 750 and 1000 words.

In the novels we read in class

1. The individual is the enemy of society

2. blah blah

etc...

I chose the first one.

Celebrities are a staple in today’s pop culture. We look to them for answers, and of course, entertainment. But with these influences pouring in from every direction, it’s important we’re aware of what’s going on around us. Celebrities by trade are being people they aren’t, truth-skewers of the highest degree — they have to be! When we see them, they’re normally in character, highly scripted and controlled with little reality behind the act. The few times they’re seen with the mask off

Celebrities, unlike your average Joe, their method requires being someone they aren’t on a day-to-day basis. The actor may be an arrogant, scruffy drug addict, but his day job is to be a sophisticated lawyer with an ironclad set of morals. It’s impractical for the public to view these people as icons and role models, when in reality, the people behind the roles don’t even portray their characters realistically. 

These commonly ogled personalities have many people deciding every move and every word they utter, are greatly thanks to hard working writers behind the scenes. When the opportunity for a witty remark strikes, we aren’t offered a team of professionals to create a charming demeanor and clever jib, only the celebrities are.

However, get to see the man or woman behind the role. But even this is only a partial truth. Few people care to hear that Scarlett Johansson tipped a waitress generously when at her nephew’s birthday party, the kind of behavior that forms who fundamentally someone is. No, that’s not interesting enough. The public want to hear about the extraordinary; exactly what they’re not experiencing. We’re far more likely to hear about the drunken, embarrassing arrest, or the large donation to help Haiti. The middle ground is where most walk, and familiarity doesn’t sell papers.

The perception of the celebrities we so often idolize have to be taken with a grain of salt. It’s dangerous to take this entertainment to heart, not those of our favorite characters.

To gain respect, two students at the author’s school in Miriam’s Song, gain respect by physically assaulting their teacher after failing a test. Although Miriam “expect[s] Markos and Khatuchera to be expelled on the spot”, “[n]othing of the sort happens” because “the principal didn’t want to be assaulted by Markos and Khatuchera too. … Teacher Mguni never whips them again” (Mathabane  171). Marko and Khatuchera gain an immunity to punishment because they are feared, something no one had achieved through doing their work. Next, Miriam earns the respect of her peers by challenging the local bully to a duel. Although her mother later scolds her, she also says that that “Amanda won’t bully [her] again” (133), no one respected her until the town bully feared her.

*Mistress Mine*

Susana stood with a group of women holding signs. Some signs were plastered with pictures of the miners. Other signs protested the negligence of San Esteban Primera, Susana was the bird. She peered down and floated over the flat, dusty compound, over the trucks and dig machinery that were peppered throughout. The teams of reporters appeared as overgrown mice to her from the air. They frantically zoomed about the site in their vans, pausing intermittently to see if they could sniff out a cheesy story. What would she say when they came sniffing to her? Would the other wives tell them about the confrontation with Marta? Had the reporters yet discovered that Yonni’s wife was not present? She watched the bird for another moment while returning to herself, hoping to see it flap its great wings. The condor was caught in a thermal though and it sailed upward on the air current until the sun singed Susana’s eyes and forced her to turn her head away. Yonni would be in her arms before those wings would thrust again.
***
Marta lifted her teabag with a spoon and dropped it into the garbage. Moving carefully to avoid spilling, sat down on the sofa and turned on the television. It would be indecent to go but it would also be indecent not to watch. Yonni was still her husband, after all. A helicopter was reporting now, providing an aerial view of the final rescues. The helicopter hovered far above the site, between the two, a condor circled. The reporter announced that Yonni Barrios would be brought up momentarily and cut to a close-up of Susana in tears. Marta turned the television off. She preferred the view from the helicopter.

Then when you consider the effects that this kind of mass networking has... What it's really done is it's turned this whole planet into a machine. An incomprehensibly complicated machine where the brain of every user is a part. 
 
People are part of the internet now. We, moulded and influenced by it tremendously
 
It profoundly shapes what each person thinks, is curious about, discovers. Even if the internet is not conscious of the fact, it is shaping the course of our entire civilisation as a result of the emergent trends of networking
 
We go down the paths it provides for us. Just an infinitely small example: Google, labelling, and ranking results are constantly changing. Even google employees don't see the intermediate nodes in the network [hidden layers]. This AI at google provides different search results for each person based on a sleugh of Data Google has about each person. This is why different people get different search results. Even if this AI is still way too primitive to be self-aware or contemplate its existence, it is deciding what results people see. It decides what people know and find or don't find. 
 
On the macro scale, even if it isn't self aware, does have a power to direct the path of human civilisation. Whatever the unconscious will of the internet, the billions of humans that make it up will carry out. We are each just nodes of this massive hulking network. We're subtly influenced by it in tiny ways constantly. No human understands all of it. IT is shaped by all of us and in turn it shapes all of us with the collective will of our species.

The Night Attack and the Downfall of Vlad Tepes III.


The Night Attack was an assault launched by Vlad Tepes III (Also known as “Vlad The Impaler” and “Dracula.”) of Wallachia on the camp of Sultan Mehmed II of the Ottoman Empire on the 17th of June, and the Sultan escaped. The conflict between the two initially began with Vlad’s refusal to pay Jizya, a tax on non-Muslims, to the Sultan. This conflict further intensified with Vlad’s invasion of Bulgaria and his impaling of more than 23,000 Turks and Bulgarians. Following this, Mehmed raised an army of around 100,000 (Although his forces’ numbers were greatly exaggerated by historians,000 men beneath him.) soldiers with the objective of capturing and annexing Vlad’s domain, wherein Vlad attempted to take the life of the Sultan,000 impaled Turks and Bulgarians. Horrified at the sight

Prior to the battle, during the attack, Vlad Tepes himself assaulted the Sultan’s tent, but mistakenly went for the tent of two grand viziers, Ishak Pasha and Mahmud Pasha.  This is thought to have been the reason for the Sultan’s escape, and Vlad’s failure in taking his life. Mehmed had a strict policy against letting his soldiers exit their tents during the night, as to not cause widespread panic in case of an attack. Vlad utilized this policy by launching his assault during the night, it was not just one

The results of the battle differ depending on the historian. Some recorded that the Wallachians slaughtered a great number of Turks, killed.  The generally accepted number of total casualties in the conflict are numbered as 5,000 for the Wallachian side and 15,000 for the Ottomans.  The victory in the camp could have been almost total for Vlad if a second army, under the command of a Wallachian Boyar names Gales would have attacked from a second direction, as Vlad had ordered. Gales was, of course, and Vlad’s failure to take the life of the Sultan, the Italian states,000 to 100

By the 8th of September, he set out to Hungary in seek of help from his former ally, Matthias Corvinus. However, upon arrival he was thrown into the castle dungeon on charges of high treason. Corvinus, not wanting to get involved in a war, forged a letter from Vlad III to the Ottomans where he supposedly proposed peace with them.  Vlad was said to be released between the years of 1462-1474, but a definite date is not known. During Vlad’s captivity, but following his death in 1475, Basarab Laiota. He left behind a legacy which is still very prominent in Romania today

In closing, was an ingenious tactician. By infiltrating the enemy encampment and discovering their system of organization, he took on a force much greater than his own, and came out of it with a third of the casualties the enemy had. It can even be argued that had his subordinate, Gales, been more obedient in crushing the enemy with his second army, that the Ottomans might have been routed completely. He was a revered, and feared ruler, skillful, while others describe him as “Monsterous

A few concerns to look for: 

* Is essay 1 too loaded with ""first world problems""? 
* Does essay 2 seem like it's trying too hard to cater to the crowd?
* Grammar


**1.  Describe a situation in which you were really stressed.  Tell us how you dealt with it.  Please detail your reaction(s), were to happen again, how would you handle it?**

Stress is an everyday occurrence for a student. It permeates everyday life, where financial, academic, and personal stressors all came together to create an extremely stressful situation. I was planning a creative way to propose to my girlfriend, working 50 hour weeks to earn enough money to buy her ring, and preparing for the MCAT simultaneously. The stress was overwhelming for a time, rendering me unable to get anything done at all, financial resolution through hard work, I will be able to tackle any challenge that comes my way.

**2.  Describe a hobby or activity other than something in medicine

One of my favorite activities currently is one which I had no knowledge of a year ago. Through the Big Brothers Big Sisters program, Alex introduced me to his favorite pastime, hobby grade RC car racing. Alex builds and modifies his own RC cars, synthesizing parts to create racing machines that can hit top speeds of 80 miles per hour. His passion is contagious, as I have come to love the Fridays that we go to the indoor track together and race his cars against men and women who have been modifying cars for longer than he has been alive. Due to the level of competition at the race track, we spend the majority of our other time together building a relationship through modifying cars and practicing on homemade race tracks. This hobby has been a great release for Alex, who did not previously have a male role model in his life alongside having to care for grandparents who are both reliant on his and his mother’s direct care. When we race RC cars, and he can simply be a kid again. Seeing this change in his life has been rewarding in itself

**1) How have your past circumstances and experiences (such as your upbringing, your future goals, and your choice of major? If you haven't decided on a college or major yet, briefly explain your intentions and aspirations for your first year at Illinois. Please limit your response to approximately 300 words**

Direction in life can be hard to find. Making clear and concise life choices takes insight and experience and unfortunately that wasn’t something I had a lot of in high school. I wasn’t lost

The truth is my knowledge of what the world was and how it would work beyond my graduation was a mystery to me as I’m sure it was too many of my classmates.  For most of us including myself how I knew the world was limited to the internet and wise advice from my older family members. I decided that I wanted to see for myself what it would be like to make it on my own and experience what people do in the field I wanted to be a part of. These decisions lead me to the Marine Corps.  

I had always been interested in electronics

During my time in the Marine Corps I had the opportunity to work with many different engineers.  I did my best to take advantage of the time I had with them, to find my direction.

**2) In no more than 300 words

I guess the best way to describe it is like being in the eye of a hurricane. Everything around me is whirl wind of chaos

Staring into a compartment for a few moments I locate the problem
	
That very moment was when I knew I wanted to be an electrical engineer. Sure I could fix

1.	Soon after beginning my job as a CNA at [Hospital] in October of 2009, who is also a nurse and a graduate of the [Institution] nursing program. I am well aware of the requirements and expectations for being a nurse, and I am ready to become one myself .
2.	I spent three years coaching gymnastics at the club where I used to train and compete. My interactions with other coaches were important, both in the gym and out. My coaches fulfilled this role when I was younger, and I was proud to be able to do the same for these girls . A few of these girls are now attending [Institution] or other colleges, and I’ve been able to give them advice and help them with their adjustment to college.
3.	A leader sets an example with their attitude and their actions both in and out of the workplace. As a student nurse, eager attitude and a passion for what I do will inspire others to follow suit. I always keep the big picture in mind while effectively completing smaller tasks. I do this by efficiently managing my time with my patients. My perseverance and strong work ethic allow me to push through the stressful and busy moments of the day, despite any difficulties encountered as a result of my hearing loss. By setting an example, I will inspire others to persevere through providing positive feedback and giving credit to those who earn it. Constructive criticism is just as important as positive feedback, and I will use these to improve my practices while inspiring others to do the same.
4.	While  in high school, and have my friends angry with me, or choose to not say anything, and keep their friendship. Ultimately, I emailed the staff of the issue the next day, along with the names of my friends. Within a few days, one girl decided that I was no longer worthy of her friendship. The second girl was angry only for a few weeks, but I still stand by my decision to speak up and do what was right.
5.	My parents began divorce proceedings at the beginning of my freshman year in college. The last three years have been hard for all of us, I was finally able to achieve grades of  which I feel I am more deserving, and reflecting this are the grades I earned in my summer and fall semesters of 2011. In June of 2009, injuries resulting from a car collision occurring two weeks prior to my start date at [Hospital] prevented me from starting. However, the manager was so impressed during my interview that she asked me to inform her when I had medical clearance to work, and they would hold my position for me until then.",,,,

An estimated 30% of child abuse survivors will continue the cycle and abuse their own children. Roughly 80% of young adults who had been abused in some way as a child developed a psychological disorder by age twenty-one. I was severely abused as a child, which is why I decided to become a clinical neuropsychologist.  
Imagine waking up in complete darkness, and lonely. Feeling the chill of ceramic on your skin reminds you that it’s not a bed you were sleeping in, but a bathtub. A long, deep rumble from your stomach announces that you are hungry, and the ability to count and feel each of your ribs suggests that you have been hungry for quite a while. You woke up not knowing the time, or what day it is, or what year. You only know not to upset your stepmother, since no one has told you to wake up. You force your eyes shut and wait
Fast-forward eleven years, yet in the same moment, I knew to be angry was not going to change that part of my life. Rather than dwelling on the negative, I searched for something positive. In my search, I found that I am a compassionate person despite all I went through, which, some might say, I knew I wanted to put my compassion to use and help people for a living.  
Originally, I realized my overly caring nature would become a problem if I were a psychologist. I felt I would become too attached to my clients and weigh myself down with their problems, which would cause more stress for me than I could handle. My love for psychology was plainly evident, though, as was my passion for helping others that had gone through some form of abuse.  
In my psychology class, I was ultimately learning that I had a whole new way to help people without having to abandon my hopes of being a psychologist.  
At that point, stroke patients – all of them and more would be under my care. They would be treated to the best of my abilities and I would know that their doctor is genuinely concerned for their wellbeing.

**here is the essay for those interested**: If I could design an interim course today,  but rarely does it involve food out of their comfort zone. Whether it be Christmas, Thanksgiving, or even the 4th of July, my parents have increasingly tried to add a hint of Peruvian culture to our food in an attempt to fuse American culture and Peruvian culture while living so far away from Peru. In my opinion, cuisine is one of the best mediums for sharing history and culture because of how families would congregate around a dinner table and share stories, and as globalization brings the world's cultures together, it is becoming more available and important to support and understand them especially in a diverse country like the U.S.. Therefore
Assuming I only have 1-2 weeks for this project, my parents have an entire archive of Peruvian cook books and know a lot of recipes by heart that they use all year around. So to begin researching won't be a problem, it will be interpreting it. On can also note that the culture of South America as a whole is quite diverse, and that most of that diversity can be relatively easy to spot. For example in countries like Brazil and Argentina, where cattle and meats in general are preferred, a strong an vibrant history of gauchos and ranchers can be found. Likewise for Peru and Chile, both of which lie on the coast, while at the same time influencing the pop culture of the region. Also as a result of this culture blend, has made countless friendships with other South American immigrants whose relationships I share and would more than be glad to help me learn more about their culture. It is therefore
	From examining various aspects of this proposed interim project

 I have not spoken to the most influential person in my life in twelve years. I know them only by their first name, chatting with and entertaining me every day. She was a profoundly kind woman, always looking to help and assist me.   

I saw Laura for many weeks, and was looking for something else to do. She eventually showed me upstairs to this machine I had only seen seldom before. My parents had not owned one yet. Laura instructed me to sit in the swivel chair which I was more interested in spinning around in than paying attention to the miracle of modern science that was occurring right in front of me. She pressed the green power button and handed me which I now know to be the mouse. Then she walked away leaving me to discover the wonders of the machine. Had this pivotal event not have occurred, had it not rained that day, my life may have been completely different. It was this event that sparked my inert interest in all things technology. The effect one person can have on your entire life is massive, and it’s important to remember you may be that person.

I am very proud of the things I have accomplished and learned with computers. Laura did an amazing thing that day. She allowed a child to learn and discover on their own with limited adult interaction. Although today I cringe at the thought of allowing a five year old use a computer unsupervised, I am applying to school to continue my self discovery and personal education in computer science. Thinking back, I am floored with the profound impact Laura had on my future. The various jobs I have worked involving computers, the friends I have met through the common interest, the list goes on. The one regret I have is never thanking Laura for the incredible thing she did for me. 3 years ago, she passed away after an unfortunately short battle with stomach cancer. I wish she could know the effect on my life she had caused, and if only I could have had more of an affect on hers.

Research Agenda: 
I am interested in researching the emergence of the civil rights movement beginning with the end of Reconstruction and throughout the Jim Crow era. From the transition of Black Codes to new forms of discrimination, resulting in pan-Africanism, radicalism, and black-nationalism. There was also international influence; for Martin Luther King it was Ghandi, for W. E. B. Du Bois it was Karl Marx, and for Malcom X it was the religion of Islam. This all occurred within the same timeframe, sparking my interest to understand how these ideas was embraced, that Martin Luther King is presently portrayed as the hero of the Civil Rights movement? The diversity of movements during Jim Crow could be an important reason to how African American heroes are represented in public history.

Summer of Weird
	I drummed my fingers on the wooden countertop risking splinters and watched uninterested potential customers walk past.  Lady Gaga started to play and I cringed as the music line-up announcing the magic show began.  I had it memorized.  Lady Gaga, “The Final Countdown.”  At first I was excited for the magic show, the zoos, the pig races – it was all so interesting and new.  It didn’t take me long to realize that none of it ever changed.  After watching the same magic performance three times a day, three days in a row, for six weeks straight I could pretty much quote their act back to them and make the damn parrot disappear myself.  The zoo animals kept looking miserable behind their bars and the short, toothless man from the World’s Largest Pig attraction didn’t stop flirting with me.  I was twenty years old and a certified, petting zoo
I looked out from underneath the wooden booth I had become so familiar with this summer.  My sunglasses rested on my nose causing sunburn to shape around the huge frames and giving me rosy cheeks.  I sighed.  My fate was to sell mugs at Wild Bill’s Olde Fashioned Soda stand at fairs across Long Island every weekend.  I had only spent time at two fairs so far; we spent three weeks in Brookhaven and after three weeks at Nassau Coliseum already, but it was pretty decent tasting if you’re into soda.  Particularly root beer and its many different flavors.  We had root beer, diet root beer, sarsaparilla, birch beer, cream, orange
	I heard the short hiss of soda coming out of its barrel and the tinkle of it hitting the tin cup. Hiss ting. The stand was designed to look like old western saloons and the soda was held in barrels where customers could serve themselves. I watched my boss Camille’s son as he hobbled from barrel to barrel. Hiss ting. Hiss ting. Hiss ting. Every time he accompanied his mother to the stands, but he was clearly stronger than me in that way.
Camille and her boyfriend Steve were my two bosses at Wild Bill’s. The pair of them never made much sense to me. She was stuck in her 20’s with the ambitions of getting a butterfly tramp stamp while Steve had invested what must’ve been his life savings into soda stands. If her son was here
I walked into the back of the stand for a “break” to avoid watching Camille’s son give himself diabetes. We technically didn’t get scheduled breaks
What made Wild Bill’s superior to your average Coke and Pepsi products was that we used real sugar instead of high fructose corn syrup. We also offered the option to do-it-yourself (which people loved!) and a cute little sales strategy.  The deal was that you could buy a small mug
In between bites of my sandwich, Heather, and her cousin Rosellen. Kerri’s mom had stumbled across the job for the three of us from because she worked with restaurants and small food businesses. Heather was a family friend to Steve and this gave her the role of manager. And Rosellen was a relative which meant she was our other manager. They both took their titles very seriously and invested a lot of time into helping Steve make back his money. Somehow, and in retrospect this doesn’t seem as coincidental as it did at the time, I always got stuck working with one of them and never with my friends.
	“We’re missing a mug
	I stared at her from beneath my sunglasses as she paced in front of the booth for maybe the second time all day, one time use mug is $12!  Or $8 for refills!”  I was told to give the more expensive prices first so I could get the customers interested in the expensive mugs which they would think was their only option.  Then, if they seemed uninterested, draw them back in with the cheaper, smaller mugs.  But there was no suave way to shout out soda deals before people walked past and onto the fried Oreo stand, so I usually ended up shouting numbers and confusing everyone, including myself.  The days were hot and the people smelled like sweat, and unclean farm animals.  
Wild Bill’s Olde Fashioned Soda Pop wanted to make sure their customers were more than happy.  Therefore we sold hats, my personal favorite item, mug clips.  That’s right.  A clip that you could buy at your local Target for $1 that we sell for $3.  Now you can have that pesky mug clipped to your belt buckle until you decided to get it filled again.  And don’t worry.  If you happened to have your mug clipped onto your pants at another fair and you spotted us, it’s only another five dollars and you get all the refills you want for that day also! 
	“Someone must have stolen one when we got swarmed before.  Just pulled it right off the wall.  Look
	“You’re probably right
Rose had an intense hatred for kids to the point where I felt the desire to protect stranger’s children from her at times.  If she wasn’t yelling soda prices from her shady perch
	She swooped into the back of the stand
I would bide my time for choosing a fight because as of now there were still carnivals that Wild Bill’s had a spot at.  Working with Rose wouldn’t be completely unlikely.  My bosses didn’t trust me with the money
	As Rose rested her smug chubby torso on the countertop, “She’s never done this before, I’m so sorry.”  
In the beginning of the day I would try to work but when it became obvious that Rose had no intention of letting me talk to people
	During the times when she wasn’t assaulting customers with the same line or resting her upper body on fat little arms in the spot I deserved to relax in too
I worked with Heather, she had an endless knowledge about the soda stand and never ending criticism about what to do to help the stand get more business.  While working with Heather, it wasn’t uncommon to hear her spewing information about the formation of the soda stand in Pennsylvania or explaining the exact mixture of the soda ingredients, which was made with REAL SUGAR instead of high fructose corn syrup.  
	I leaned against the outside of the stand and watched the magic show.  The wind picked up and threw the scent of dirty animal and fried dessert into my face and I felt my stomach roll over.  No one was going to come get any soda right now because most people were watching the act for their first and only time.  I envied them.  I flipped out my phone and sent a quick text to Jackie and Kerri complaining about Rose stealing my spot
	“You know
	I turned around and stared at her
	Today was one of the days when Steve and Camille decided to show up and ask us unnecessary inventory questions and unload extra merchandise (as if we would run out) as an excuse to make sure I wasn’t stealing their money.  Sometimes they stayed and worked with us.  Luckily today I didn’t have to bear the awkwardness of watching Steve trot around the front of the stand like an overly territorial bear preying on innocent carnival goers
	Camille came over to Rose eyeing the register and me standing in front of the stand.  Even under her sunglasses I saw her stare at me
“Oh
“Yeah
Then came silence and the realization that his noticing wasn’t a compliment.
I came around to the back and started to clean up the small space so it looked like I was at least doing something.  She walked past me and I caught the smell of sunscreen emphasizing her fear of skin cancer.
	“Have you guys sold a lot of mugs today?  Boy
	“Yeah
	She nodded.  “Yeah
	I nodded.  It was useless trying to explain how badly this was going to end for them seeing as they invested way too much money and time in this business already.
	“Okay guys
	When Camille said she was going to text us with our hours on Monday, and Sunday from noon to one a.m.  It was great when I tried to make plans with anyone or spend some time with my family.  I truly admired Camille and Steve’s incredible organization when running a business together.  
	Camille walked away gripping her Coach bag closer to her arm and pulling a Razor phone out to text someone.  She wore jeans that hugged her hips and her shirt rode up slightly in the back exposing her lower back.  Her straightened and highlighted hair swung below her shoulder blades and I tried to imagine how she looked when she was actually in her 20’s.
	“Nicole
	“Sure
	I followed him to his van parked behind the other stand and waved quickly to Jackie and Kerri.  They looked equally as bored as I felt and perked up upon seeing Steve, not to be trusted.
	I tried to help carry the heavy, looking for lighter things to carry and leaving the big boxes to the man of the stand.
	After a few more minutes of unnecessary bustling, Steve finally decided to leave.  I looked at my cell phone quickly, afraid of getting yelled at for texting, and checked the time.  10:30 p.m. on a Sunday.  My weekend was almost over and I couldn’t be happier.
	Standing at the front of the stand again as the crowd started to dwindle after the last magic show
	“Just here fer my free sodar
	“Gotta start gettin’ the ponies ready ta go.”  He told me this because he knew I found the ponies to be adorable.  “Hrm
“How about cream?”
“Thas a good choice.  Cream it is!”
He filled his mug up and started to cut back behind my tent towards his own
This encounter would have made me feel uncomfortable and probably want to go home if a week prior to this I hadn’t already had the most uncomfortable encounter with another carney.  It was during a rainy Saturday and there were no fair-goers on this sad day.  We all sat there enclosed in our semi-dry tents and trailers
“Do you want to ride the Pirate Ship?”  A thin
The smooth benches were damp from the rain which had stopped intentionally for this moment of embarrassment.  I sat on their cool surface and discomfort coursed through my blood as the ride started.  I smiled and pretended to have a good time while the man operating the machine watched me in amusement
The plastic pirate ship rocked back and forth
The ship started to slow down and came to its rocky finish.  The metal pole released me and I walked down the path toward him
“Thanks so much!  That was really fun
“No problem!  You want to ride it again?”
“Oh
	“All right
	I heard the whine of the ponies as they were tied to ropes and led out of the tent and realized that it was probably time to shut down our stand as well.  My cell phone confirmed that it was 12:30 in the morning.  Rose had already taken down the pegs and mugs on the front of the stand and was pulling down the t-shirt rack.  I grabbed paper towels and a generic cleaning solvent and started to scrub up the dry sugar underneath the soda handles.  The stand folded in on itself through us probing around with long metal poles
	Two days later I received a phone call from Camille.  I was surprised because it was early in the week and she usually waited as long as possible to give us our schedules.
	“Nicole
	“Are you kidding me?”
	“I’m afraid not.”  Her tone changed from sympathy to sudden impatience.  “Also
“What are you talking – No?  A flower?  I’m sorry
“You can pick up your last check sometime later this week.”
	The phone call ended and just like that I had been fired from my first job ever.  My summer as a well-paid carney was cut short because my bosses didn’t trust me with their money and thought I drew a flower on their crappy wooden soda stand.  I was shocked.  
	I sent her a text asking if there was any way I could keep my job for the next two weeks before I went back to school.  Hours later she let me know that she talked to Steve,,False,,t5_2s6rw,False,,True

During the seventh grade there was a girl named Ashley. Ashley was a girl in my class who I was pretty good friends with. We had a few classes together that we would often talk in. However one day in one of the classes she realized she was missing twenty dollars that she had had that morning. When I first saw her she just looked confused
Then I can remember her looking at me and saying “You stole my money.”
At first I had no idea what she was talking about
“I had twenty dollars in my backpack and you stole it, clueing the teacher in on what we were talking about.
 The teacher then walked over to us and asked why we were being so loud
 Then the teacher looked at me and I said “I have no idea what Ashley is talking about.” I then reached my hands in my pockets pulling out nothing to show her my pockets were empty and that I didn’t have her money. However the teacher insisted that I was lying and that I returned Ashley’s money. Getting even more annoyed than I already was after being accused of stealing
Over the next few minutes the tone of the conversation began get more and more aggressive then finally the teacher said
Again insisting that I didn’t have the twenty dollars the teacher sent me to the office. This being my first ever trip to the office I was scared. I didn’t know what to expect and even though I thought the reasoning was nonsense I had no idea how my principle would react. When I got to the office I had to sit there and wait because the principle was busy with a visitor. I had to have sat in the office for at least 45 minutes thinking of how ridiculous the entire situation was before the vice principle came in.
The Vice Principle asked “Why are you here.” 
I told him “My teacher sent me here because she thought I stole from a girl in my class.”
Then the vice principle brought me into his office. Before I could even tell him my side of the story he said “Stealing is a really serious thing and the best way you could fix this is to just give Ashley her money back.”
“I have no idea what happened to her money
“I don’t think a teacher would send you to the office is she wasn’t sure you had the money and the only way I can let you go back to class is if you empty your pockets and let me search your backpack” said my vice principle.
 I emptied my pockets and handed over my bag
When I got back to class Ashley had her hand out assuming I was coming to give her the twenty dollars she lost but instead I told her “I don’t have your money and the vice principle already searched my bag.”
 Again with the annoyed look on her face I could tell she still did not believe me. The teacher told her to sit down and that this had already disrupted enough of the class.

The hunter quickly moved through the forest as he took shot after shot. Each shot screamed towards their target.  “The caravan reinforcements have arrived
	

He shot the last few members of the horde as he came upon the caravan. The guards stepped forward pulling what seemed to be a chest between them. “This is our gift to you
	

The hunter stepped forward and kneeled in front of the chest noticing a padlock on the front. He reached into his bag and pulled out a set of picks and within no time at all he popped the chest open. The glint of gold graced his eyes as he noticed a stack of arrows that was about as wide as the chest itself.

My motivation to serve with the Student Conservation Association stems from a personal passion growing over several years. This application is a step in my career that I have come to by recent years of work experience and exploring personal interests. I began applying to Peace Corps shortly before I earned my degree in business administration. After a year of satisfying work in real estate management I joined Peace Corps and served in Moldova for two years. After completing Peace Corps and returning home, and ecological design techniques in Puerto Rico. Plenitud implements principles of perma-culture and I learned more about how real sustainability can be possible. In pursuance of sustainability, I think how our resources are managed and studied must be based on principles of environmental stewardship and conservation. Our natural resources are increasingly precious in this era of unprecedented population growth, technological advancement, and consumption. I am applying to graduate schools in related areas because I think it is imperative to intelligently and effectively conserve, study, and manage the environmental resources available. Gaining skills and training from the National Parks Service would strengthen my candidacy to these graduate programs.

Part of Peace Corps service my service was to live in average, life, and culture. Like many volunteers in Moldova, I lived in an agricultural, rural town where much of my host family's food came from what they grew. There I led a youth group for extra curricular English, cultural exchange and critical thinking, and computer literacy for adults and youth. I had the opportunity to learn about about the farming culture in Moldova that has been passed down for centuries, harvesting, I perceived a similar harmony among the community where neighbors helped each other for the greater good. More than ever

I was admitted to the University of Missouri School of Natural Resources and have explored potential research projects with my advisor. However, as both types of assignments have openings where I can receive various types of training of which I can take great advantage. With parks services I will employ my new skill set and receive training that would allow me to further explore related fields. Having done some research and reading more than a few position openings, I know that I would fit well within the professional culture and work at National Parks. I am a diligent worker who is excited to contribute to public land conservation efforts.

Permaculture projects such as constructing earth-bag housing was a great experience for me seeing tangible examples of sustainability. Plenitud allowed me to learn about sustainability by doing type of work found through the conservation corps. I was responsible for tasks required of many position openings for example, and maintained the facility of the farm in trail maintenance; vegetation control; and equipment maintenance. The goals of my projects at Plenitud also had similar purposes as those in the NPS e.g. sustainability, conservation, and education. Both local and national student volunteers visit Plenitud's farm in Puerto Rico for educational and internship opportunities. I had the pleasure of training more experienced interns in earth-bag construction, and student volunteers in agro-forestry. I am seeking this position not only because I will like it but because I value the exchange of knowledge and my experience allows me to do work, I hold important, well.

Like most, with other professionals who are joined together for that common purpose.",,False,,t5_2s6rw,False,,

ENG 4UN – 05
Wednesday July 17

                                                       Power That Corrupts Us All 

	Power plays a substantial role in the play King Lear written by William Shakespeare. The theme of power is recognized in many aspects of the play including exploitation by the characters for their utmost inheritance. The urge to retain the most power creates many destructive and corrupting effects. It destroys many relationships and provokes the mentality to do anything to claim it. The theme of power is shown through the miserable events that affect the tragic hero

The power that Lear possesses at the beginning of the play leads him to be pulled towards his hamartia. This is shown when the title of 'King' is abused by Lear.  An example would be when he asks his daughters to prove their love for him.  This act is useless because Lear proclaims that Cordelia is already his favourite as he calls her ""our joy"" (1.1.84). It shows the foolishness and insecurity in Lear because love has to be forced out of his daughters to please him. It could be said that his misery is deserved because his actions were questionable as a king.  The feeling of pathos is put upon the audience when Lear declares he is a ""poor, and despised old man” (3.2.20). It is evident that Lear's hubris has gone and his mindset has changed. The real hardship occurs when Lear loses Cordelia just as he rejoices with her (5.3.305). To conclude, Lear’s ill-mannered and power-infected mind leaves him with nothing to live for.

Similarly, this could have easily been prevented, identical to Lear’s situation. When Gloucester had found out about Edgar’s letter, he asked Edmund “Has he never before sounded you in this business” and was responded with “Never my lord” (1.2.69-71). Nonetheless, he continues to believe Edmund when a simple confrontation could have sufficed. Even Gloucester’s foolishness brings pathos upon the audience. Gloucester’s eye gets pulled out (3.7.71), and we feel pity because even his questionable decisions were not deserving of this act. Evidently, Edmund’s addiction to power brings his father down to his lowest point

It is clear that Goneril and Regan have created a mutual alliance. It is first depicted through their hand holding at the beginning of the play (2.4.194-195). As we move along, the two crooked siblings lead to each other’s demise. A gentleman informs Edmund that Goneril had poisoned her own sister and killed herself as well (5.3.226-227). This reinforces the persuasive powers of corruption because the former loving sisters, kill each other for a mate who also is enriched in power.

Coincidentally, that have I done, and more, much more. The time will bring it out, Tis past and so am I” (5.3.162-164). Sadly, it is too late and Edmund parishes. To close, the irrationality of Edmund and his power leads to the destruction of him and his family.

The corruption and destructive traits of power are clearly evident in Shakespeare’s King Lear. William Shakespeare emphasizes the enormous brainwashing ability of power by reinforcing it through the betrayal of Lear’s daughters, King Lear and Gloucester. The theme of power is one that is affective in emphasizing the development of characters, and revealing the plot in the tragedy of King Lear.

-------

When I was three years old, I knew everything would be alright. I don’t think I really understood what a vet was back then, but I decided right then and there that I was going to be one when I grew up. From then on, I always wanted to go with my family to watch what the vet was doing, even if it was just for a checkup. 

As I grew older, and bark every time he saw a truck he didn’t like, but the deep sigh he would heave as he lie down by my bed every night was a telling sign that he was getting older. 

When I was 14, and would look at us like he knew something was wrong. Almost overnight, he got so sick that my mom knew she had to take him to get checked out. That was the first time I didn’t go with her to the vet, and the last time I saw Buster. He had cancer.

--------

Losing Buster was a difficult experience, I had never considered the difficult decisions that both family and professional must make in certain situations. I had failed to take into account how frustrating the job could be, and how powerless we really are in the end. Instead of crumbling my resolve to become a veterinarian, though, it solidified it. From my volunteer work and internships, I have learned much more about the difficulties of the field, both for animal and for human.

By time I left home for college, as a technician. Understanding how and why we do what we do in the field is of major benefit, and is something you can’t learn in a traditional university. My second degree will be in Environmental and Organismal Biology with a minor in chemistry, and will cover nearly all of the prerequisites to get accepted into a school of veterinary medicine. My third and final undergraduate degree—which I am nearly finished with— will be in Psychology with a minor in anthropology. Too many medical professionals fail to care for their clients as much as they do for their work. I want to be a compassionate and caring veterinarian, and feel that it is extremely important for a professional to understand how and why their clients feel and act as they too.

Though it sounds like a long and difficult journey, I want to be back in my hometown of Ivins, starting the city’s first mixed animal veterinary practice, as well as a family of my own. I want to help animals to grow up to be happy and healthy. I want to mend their broken bones and fix illnesses and injuries. I want to ease their pain when they grow old, and help them to pass when it is no longer possible to go on. Most importantly, I want to give back to the animals, people

1362712686.0,19w1l2,The Great Gatsby Essay Due March 8th. Not looking for super detailed proofreading,Reflextion,6,1,1,"Prompt: How does fitzgerald's use of dialogue

My teacher says my writing goes off topic and are very awkward sounding and i MUST agree but i can't help but lose focus during my essay so please inform me wherever i go off topic

Forget the Past

There comes a time in everyones life when they want to go back in time and start over. In the novel, Jay Gatsby and Daisy Buchanan, try to recreate a relationship that they had long ago. Fitzgerald emphasizes the impracticability of recreating the past shown in his descriptive word choice, his clever use of shadows, and his thoughtful connection of boats to Gatsby’s life in order to convey a sense of illusion.

A large part of the story is told in the conversations that the characters have with each other. Fitzgerald uses words in every conversation that help make the situation clearer and show how each character feels. It is clear that Gatsby is trying to reawaken a fantasy that he has with Daisy because of the way he speaks whenever he talks about it. Gatsby is a calm and collective man but he changes when he talks about his love with Daisy. When Nick tries to tell Gatsby that he can’t repeat the past Gatsby replies, Daisy is more like Nick meaning she wants to recreate the past but she accepts the fact that it is illogical to try and recreate something from five years ago. Gatsby overwhelms Daisy with his talk of creating   a new life together which pushes Daisy to say, “""Oh, you want too much!"" she cried to Gatsby. ""I love you now – isn't that enough? I can't help what's past."" She began to sob helplessly.” Important words that Fitzgerald uses are “cried”, “sob”, and “helplessly”. These words show that Daisy has broken out of the illusion and she feels sad that Gatsby still insists on being with her. Daisy says that she can’t do anything to change the past because what’s done is done and nothing can alter it. Fitzgerald’s word choices and dialogue show where Daisy and Gatsby stand on recreating the past.

Fitzgerald implements shadows throughout the book to portray the impossibility of obtaining the past. A shadow is an illusion that Gatsby is constantly trying to get a hold of. When Nick tells Gatsby he should not be trying to get Daisy back, just out of reach of his hand.” Gatsby thinks that the shadows are concealing his past with Daisy and that is the reason why it is so difficult to be with Daisy again. The shadow represents the past of Gatsby and Daisy, it’s there and is visible but it is forever out of their reach since they can’t reach out and grab it. Shadows are just an illusion of their past and Gatsby wants to stay in the illusion. Gatsby behaves differently went he and Daisy meet up, immediately, “Gatsby got himself into a shadow and while Daisy and [Nick] talked conscientiously from one to the other”. Gatsby is only interested in living in the past which is why he goes toward the shadow. Gatsby is unsure of how he is going to rewrite the past but does not want to think that it will not be possible which is why he hides himself in the shadows. The shadows represent a happy place for Gatsby to hide in whenever his plan of recreating the past is in jeopardy.

The metaphor that Fitzgerald uses at the end of the novel, borne back ceaselessly into the past,” is used to show that Gatsby is living in an illusion. He constantly tries to recreate his past with Daisy but he never succeeds. Attempt after attempt, Gatsby is just a boat going against the current. There is no use for Gatsby to go against the flow of things because it will always push back harder and set him right back to square one or farther behind. His advancements toward Daisy only brought himself further away from his goal of actually being with her because they got people involved and made Daisy become less comfortable with the situation. Time only moves forward and it is best to just go with the flow.
The possibility of recreating the past is just an illusion that people get stuck in.

1357694761.0,167x9s,Can I get some constructive criticism on a paragraph I had to write about an Emily Dickinson poem,PolkaPanda,4,1,5,"Warning Wall of Text:
We were given a paragraph for state testing prep and I am wondering how my wording is and if there are any blaring mistakes or something.
Here were the guidelines:
Choose a specific literary element or literary technique used in one of the poems. Using specific details from either ""I Heard A Fly Buzz-- when I died"" or ""I felt a funeral, show how the author uses that element or technique to develop the passage.

Here is what I wrote:
The use of First Person point of view in Emily Dickinson's poem ""I felt a Funeral, however, it is from the dead's perspective which adds an eeriness to the poem. One detail that helps develope the tone is when the narrator is describing the coffin being moved; ""And then I heard them lift a Box And creak across my Soul"". By describing the sounds we might get the feeling of being trapped in a box, isolated. This also describes how being from the perspective of the dead we obtain details differently. Another detail that describes how information is obtained occurs in Line 14 ""And being, but an Ear"". This helps us understand how information is taken in because Ears can only hear. This adds a feeling of lonliness that is magnified by line 16 ""Wrecked, Solitary, here"". The use of First Person Perspective helps develope how we get details and adds the feelings of isolation and eeriness to the tone of the poem.

1355093648.0,14kj5j,Letter of application for USNA nomination.,BattleTitts,4,0,0,"First off

Dear Reader

Before you continue

I have had a fairly average, and because of that, it made me soft physically and mentally. It wasn't that I was unintelligent, it was that I lacked the discipline and determination to strive for greatness. I didn't push myself in school because it wasn't required. School had always been easy, and I kept progressing with everyone else. I was “happy” because I was satisfied with going through the motions and getting to the next level. Only until a couple years ago did I come to the realization that I have virtually wasted 17 years of my life because I hadn't pushed myself further. I hated myself for it.

The lessons of life only earned through experience had been slow to communicate, but an easy life lacking sufficient pressure has given me a lack of structure and direction. “What do I do now?” Had been my motto for the last year. As I worked and went to school I couldn't find any solutions and I felt like I was wasting even more time. Every day that went by I felt as if I was slipping further and further into a lifestyle that would render me a nobody; A person that might not be better or for worse, but simply exist. Out of every possible outcome for my life's impact, this troubled me the most. I did not want to continue standing aimlessly as the world passed me by, only to grow old and look back at my life with regret. I wish to harbor great pride from my life's accomplishments. I want to actually make a difference for the better and contribute the most as possible to the United States and to this planet's welfare. 

The one true goal that I have made in my life has been very influential in recent months. I want to squeeze every last drop of hard earned potential out of my being and live with dignity and honor. I want be formed into a true leader. I want to become a person who inspires others not by persuasion

I intend to join the United States Naval Academy because the goals that I hope to accomplish cannot be attained from a civilian lifestyle or a civilian career. I want to become a U.S Navy SEAL. It is by far my most ambitious goal. However
 
Sincerely
BattleTitts

I'm writing about Margaret of Anjou's role in the play, I'm still concerned that it's just too disorganized and confused. Any feedback on the structure of my argument(s) would be greatly appreciated.

I initially didn't explore the ways Margaret proves herself a foil for Richard in my introduction because I thought it was obvious

I just want my introduction to make the assertions that Margaret is a crone (after defining that a crone is) in the literary tradition because she has some mysticism, casting curses, and making prophecies. She shows her wisdom by ""seeing through"" Richard and thus proves herself his foil. Margaret is demonstrated to be a foil for Richard by their similar but opposed powers and strategies: breaking the fourth wall, making realized prophecies vs. making false prophecies, and wishing death on those considered deserved vs enacting death on those considered innocent. In all of these ways, Margaret, as a crone, blood-feuding

It’s hard to imagine that one small act, can change someone’s life. This is exactly what happened to me on a birthday when, out of a gift from my great aunt, my world changed forever. The gift wasn’t that big of a deal, a Science textbook written for kids, something my aunt probably found browsing her local bookstore. I wasn’t really even that excited for it, I had never heard of it before, once I began to read it, including one on History by the same author. Other books

In school, I could finish homework in a short amount of time, and then I would immediately go back to these books and games that sparked interest in me. For example, back in Elementary and Middle School, I knew more about World War 2 than my history teachers due to my own researching of the subjects. In Eighth Grade, I was christened the nickname “google” for being able to answer every question in my Honors History Class. School was never hard for me, I only had to put a minimal amount of work into it, when it got time to put more work into school I was so used to the bare minimum I became overwhelmed, and other extracurricular activities clogging all of my team, the fact that they had a huge impact on my life is relevant. 

Even now, a topic that most people probably have never even heard of, which caught my interest through my own research. I hope to major in either Economics or Political Science in College, and to pursue a career in one of those fields. All of this thanks to a little boy and a book his great aunt picked out.



Tell us about a personal quality, contribution or experience that is important to you. What about this quality or accomplishment makes you proud and how does it relate to the person you are?

What I consider one of my greatest accomplishments comes from a common source, or getting a merit badge, but it came from my actions, and the confirmation that I was leading the kids correctly in such a manner that they respected me while learning. 
These words stemmed from the second half of my sophomore year in high school, I was just looking to get my Eagle rank, and then get out. But then, in a sudden turn of events, I was offered by my Scoutmaster to come and help with the training of some of the younger boys who were just getting started scouting. Not entirely sure what to expect, but hoping to earn some respect among the adults and some leeway in the troop for later, I accepted. Over the course of that weekend, how to pitch a tent, I tried to take it a step further. When it came to do flags the second evening of the campout, and then had them hold up their arms in the salute for even longer

During those couple of days, about how sometimes, whether we like it or not, we all have an influence on those surrounding us. I remembered that weekend how, when I was in their shoes, how much I looked up to the older boys volunteering to help my peers and I, how mature they must have been. Then I realized that for them, and I now had that responsibility, but this specific example showed me how, I always get them to stop.  

Feedback appreciated!

        To better understand what O’ Connor was trying to reveal in her short story “Revelation”
we need to better understand O’Connor’s background a bit more. By reading into O’Connor
learn that she was reared in the south and was a devout catholic. Many of her stories include a
religious meaning. Her readers gain some value by the end of the story. The story “Revelation”
by Flannery O’Connor’s is one with a powerful message. Revelation is a story with a meaning
that can be universal to all people. O’Connor reveals her message by intentional use of specific
characters
deliver her message of self-evaluation before judgment of others. These elements surround the
protagonist to help show the symbolism of the revelation that occurs in the story.

         The use of character is important to articulate the message of the story. O’Connor uses
different characters to develop her argument in a dramatic way. The protagonist
is a southern white woman with money. She is confident that she is a good woman; we pick up
quickly that she is a hypocrite by how she describes herself. This woman judges all those around
her
social status. O’Connor uses the character of Mrs. Turpin to display the kind of prejudice and
stereotypical people of that time. She represents how O’Connor viewed the white middle class
from that era. We see that Mrs. Turpin is overbearing and strong willed by the introduction of
her husband
disagree with her or her ways. The purpose of the Mr. Turpin is to show that Mrs. Turpin is not
the kind of person to be reasoned with. She does not have anyone other than God that tells her
she is right or wrong. The story introduces the antagonist
of eighteen or nineteen” (O’Connor 393) who is sitting in the doctor’s waiting room reading a
book that also has a secret meaning to deliver. Mary Grace is also of the same class or category
that Mrs. Turpin identifies herself with. Although it seems O’Connor regarded Mary Grace as a
higher status than Mrs. Turpin. Mary Grace did not like the prejudice or the racism. Mary Grace
grows angrier as Mrs. Turpin discusses race and other classes of people as if they didn’t exist.
The white-trash characters
all symbolic of how O’Connor viewed the different types of people in that time of racism.

       Irony is used frequently by O’Connor in this short story. The name of the character
Mary Grace has several multifaceted meanings. Knowing O’Connor’s catholic background
name Mary is symbolic of the Virgin Mary. In the catholic faith
guidance to salvation. Mary Grace’s character is exactly that to Ruby Turpin. She is what Mrs.
Turpin needed to guide her to her revelation. The bible also states that Mary is full of Grace and
this is ironic in the story because the girl Mary Grace is described as ugly
of acne. She was characterized as being rude for not wanting to talk to Mrs. Turpin. The book
Mary Grace’s reading “Human development” is significant to the message in the story because
it is the book she hits Mrs. Turpin across the face with. The irony in this is that it’s like someone
needs to smack Mrs. Turpin with a guide book on how to be human. The hymn that is playing
on the radio in the waiting room is relevant because without fully listening or understanding the
song
promotion of equality and togetherness of all kinds of people as a whole. It is not about one class
helping another is about all people helping each other.

           The setting is carefully chosen by O’Connor to put the revelation into perspective. The
doctor’s office is described as being small
with different types of people. The size and the fullness of the office represent how small the
world really is. The doctor’s office is a place of opportunity for change and unity. A place where
all types of people can communicate and also be together. The character of Mrs. Turpin took it as
an opportunity to be grateful for who she was in society and did not acknowledge the opportunity
to gather with different types of people. It is described as the exact opposite of the pig parlor
the other setting in the story. The pig parlor has concrete floors
pig parlor is a place of solidarity
ways. Mrs. Turpin is seen to have her views on life backwards. She enjoys her presence in the
pig parlor over the doctor’s office. O’Connor uses the setting to display how she views society.
There are people who accept unity and those who will not change. It is not until Mrs. Turpin
goes to the pig parlor
only who must change.

        O’Connor delivers the message in “Revelation” by providing visual
props throughout the story. There is consistent use of irony
apparent such as the name of the girl who delivers the message that Mrs. Turpin needed to
hear or the title of the book she was reading. O’Connor uses distasteful language and extreme
violence to express her meaning in this story as well as many others she has written. The
characteristics and personalities of the characters in the story are specific to her purpose as well.
The ways the characters are depicted are O’Connor’s interpretation of people in society. All of
the elements used frequently by Flannery O’Connor help create a powerful message as well as a
dramatic impact.",,t5_2s6rw,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/Proofreading/comments/11ovls/thank_you_for_your_time_in_proofreading_this/

Mr. Flynn also makes ridiculous accusations against members of the staff at the gas station including James. These statements include but are not confined to accusing James of playing favorites among his staff and giving Mr. Flynn shifts which he feels are unfair and made in an attempt to aggravate Mr. Flynn. He also accuses members of “stealing his customers”.

Mr. Flynn is also known to be loud and obnoxious, jokes and other sorts of humor. Mr. Flynn will also on the occasion, stick his head in inappropriately inside customers cars.

Flynn has earned the dubious distinction of being the only person in the stations current roster, accusing him of making subtle actions in order for him to “take the hint”. Such as and not confined to, not hanging his certificates up in the station. Such statements are frequent and just as ridiculous as the one mentioned above. 

Mr. Flynn also likes to bring his personal life into the work place, and often use them as excuses for sympathy among the staff and, more importantly customers.

1/31/12 Thecklin’s return, we swap tales, Caldera’s catacombs, the Duskmen attack

 

The date was 2nd Marthracian, but he appeared to have been gone for years. His beard was gray like an old man who had read many tomes and was wise beyond his years, but alas he was the same Thecklin that had left us just days before. And he still retained a blonde streak down the center of his beard. We welcomed him briefly and decided to meet at Arend’s to break our fast. Once all were fed, we talked quietly of thinks that mustn’t be spoken of at the ale house, and decided to meet at Crowther’s Mound at midnight for a more in-depth discussion. We parted ways to take care of the day’s business.

 

Thecklin headed for the synoptrium, Thecklin produced a cold iron short sword and asked the prior to detect if it was magical. As the prior sang and cast, Thecklin noticed that the prior was just a shell of a man, and his powers were not of meriaun. Thecklin recited some of the 19th book of the way of light, and the prior recognized a new power in Thecklin. Thecklin called the prior out on the fact that he was not truly of meriaun, and yet the prior remained silent.

 

Severyn and Caldera attended home business.

 

Adalwulf had a small, hinged orb crafted to hold the magical ring he had found.

 

Huw was nowhere to be found. It was sad really

 

Midnight came, Severyn of his time with Caldera in the catacombs under Caldera’s house, and Adalwulf of the genie he and Huw met.

 

We decided to find and kill the giant spider that was still lurking under Caldera’s house. We went to the catacombs and found what we thought was the spider hiding in a well. We started a fire in the well, and approach the spider from the outside entrance. However, as we were headed to the alternate opening, we heard a loud commotion coming from the center of town. We raced toward Eidrol’s and discovered several Duskmen attacking Geidrok and the other patrons of Eidrol’s boarding house. After a few were killed the others fled, but not before making off with *** and Geidrok’s ring finger. He was concerned that his wife would kill him because they took his ring.",,False,t5_2s6rw,True
1327457332.0,oveov,My analysis of George Washington's farewell address.,smayhew,4,0,1,"Assignment:

You are the curator of an American History museum. You are displaying a “Famous American Documents” exhibit which will showcase many famous documents from the early federal period of American History. Next to each document is a small placard created by the museum staff which provides patrons a brief summary.


Your task is to draft a summary of the 1796 Farewell Address of George Washington (click here for a transcript) for the placard. In no more than two single spaced pages (preferably one), or events from our lectures that could help explain the Farewell Address. Finally, please make sure to compare or contrast the Farewell Address to Washington’s Inaugural Address which begins on page 13 of Adams, The Early American Republic. The key is to give the patron an understanding of the significance of the document as well as sense of its historical context, but to do so in a compelling and concise manner.

My Paper:
	
George Washington’s farewell address came before the election of John Adams and at a time in which the politics that would shape the future of the United States were beginning to be divided between parties.  This historic document relays the feelings that Washington had toward such division and also expressed his thoughts on the future of the country.  When compared with his Inaugural address one cannot help but notice the change in tone and knowledge that Washington has gained during his tenure as the President of the newly founded country.

One of the most important points that can be noted from Washington’s presidency is the one in which he addresses at the beginning of his farewell.  Although Washington was wanted and by some perhaps even expected to continue in his position as President he declines the proposition of running for another term.  In doing this he sets a precedent for future Presidents of not serving more than two consecutive terms in office.  Although this was not officially the limit of terms that one single person may serve until FDR

It cannot help be noticed that Washington spends a large portion of the beginning of his farewell address issuing warnings and expressing his thoughts about the danger of having separate and defined parties in the politics of the US.  He begins this by speaking about how the geographical distinctions that separate the country should not be considered as dividing lines in the nation.  Washington then warns many times over that in order to be a single and unified government all parts and participants have to learn to cooperate with one another and to do so peacefully.  Washington at the time was considered a Federalist due to his wanting of a strong federal government that decided on most matters that affected the individual states and as there always will be when a group of people get together their were opposing points of view. The anti-Federalists believed that the common people and state governments should be able to decide on their own how to run things in their respective states and that to have such a strong type of government would be too close for comfort to the days when the US was under the jurisdiction of a Monarch.  It should be known that the party divisions were very distinct and clear shortly after the time John Adams became President in 1796.

Washington also expresses his concerns about American neutrality and maintaining positive foreign relations with all the nations that the US had ties.  At the time there were rising hostilities between the French and Great Britain and in the opinion of Washington

Lastly a main theme that can be noticed when comparing Washington’s inaugural and farewell addresses are the changes in his tone and the material that make up these speeches.  Washington begins his presidency amidst throngs of supporters and citizens that are celebrating his new position and yet Washington instead of joining in and reveling in the importance of his office takes a more somber tone and expresses to a no doubt bewildered Congress his concerns and doubts about taking this office and how he thought of it as a patriotic duty and honor not as a major victory.  When then looking at his farewell address one notices that the somber notes may still be present but instead of appearing to be a young

This piece of history before you gives such insight and speaks volumes about the young country and the man most associated with its birth.  There is so much hidden in the language and between the paragraphs that tell the story of Washington’s presidency and the history of the US though the span of years he was in office.  There can be no doubt that Washington was a true patriot who believed in this idea of a new country that governed itself and he took pride in being forever associated as a key player in its founding.  Washington also set forth a standard for those to follow for the respect and reverence that should be held for the position.  The legacy of George Washington shall forever be remembered and his name will always stir patriotic emotions in the citizens of his country.

Although, specifically societal influences, from Willy's family background, education and to society's influence in shaping his perception of the American dream, for that reason, Arthur Miller offers a fair critique of the American dream ideal and sheds light into its inherent flaws.

Here are the topics:
1 Evaluate a significant experience, or ethical dilemma you have faced and its impact on you. 

2 Discuss some issue of personal, or international 

3 Indicate a person who has had a significant influence on you

4 Describe a character in fiction, music, science, etc.) that has had an influence on you, and explain that influence. 

5 A range of academic interests, describe an experience that illustrates what you would bring to the diversity in a college community, or an encounter that demonstrated the importance of diversity to you. 

6 Topic of your choice.
Essay:
&gt; 	I remember as a little boy I used to sit on the front steps of my apartment building, I let my imagination run wild, which would ultimately lead me to conjure ideas and thoughts I had about myself.  The topic of interest in every thought was “What am I going to do with my life?”  Am I going to be a cop? Am I going to be a firefighter? Or am I going to be a lawyer?  
	For the purpose of being organized, using books and other resources that were related to the career.  To be a little surer about my top three career choices stated above, I promised myself to at least have an experience relating to each choice.
	For instance, such as having the feeling of knowing that you are protecting millions of New Yorkers and acting as a role model for young kids.  As she was telling me this, I couldn’t help but ponder over the utility belt that she was wearing with her police uniform.  The belt contained a large, black flashlight and three empty sockets.  One socket, however, caught my eye the most.  I realized that this interesting socket was for her gun.  After this realization, I knew I couldn’t be cop.  I wouldn’t have the power to carry such an overbearing thing that can possibly kill someone, destroy a family.  As if this weren’t enough
	Completely infuriated, I saw something that completely amazed me, and not in a good way.  Liter was everywhere on the street.  Smashed plastic containers, candy wrappers, and tissues were scattered all over.  My heart sunk at the sight of this.  How can someone who inhabits the Earth, even calls it its own home, deliberately destroy it?
	Since this affected me greatly

The ohara Valley which I want to introduce to you is one of the most popular summer resorts of Osaka-do, the well made by water of Ohara Valley is actually jade-green. You can even find fishes swimming out through the water of the well. Actually, I had never been a water landscape until I got the Ohara Valley, and I was really excited to watch the great landscape.
	
  I guess you may wonder how I could find that gorgeous summer resort out. It was very lucky. My friend and I sought for somewhere to spend our summer vacation through internet, therefore, gave up seeking our destination through internet social community. Instead, we called tourist information center of Osaka-do to get a recommendation. They said that there is a suitable resort for us, and recommend the Ohara Valley site because it is not so far away from Seoul and not overcrowded. I believe that was a great choice. Anyway, we started off on a journey to the Ohara Valley with fluttering hearts.

Immediately after our arrival at the place, you should be aware of drowning because there are so many depth points in the well. Actually, I almost fell into the deep water, but managed to get out of there luckily. In addition, it is important to prepare for eating. However, you don’t have to worry about carrying with heavy foodstuffs because there is a Nong-Hyup Mart which sells everything very cheaply. Hence there is no need for carrying heavy icebox. We bought some pork meats to enjoy the middle of the night party. It was awesome, too.

Now, the pellucid water and the moderate crowd. However, I can tell you those are not all why I recommend you; ultimately, you can feel the mother-nature and heal yourself exhausted, leaving from your stuffy city life. Well, How about planning your next summer vacation with visiting the Ohara Valley?




My Ideal Wife

The most people have the own standards to choose their other half in their minds for their dream spouses, I would discuss about some standards of choosing my ideal companion.

First of all, because she is supposed to be my entire marital life partner neither my opponent nor enemy whenever we are trying to overcome hardship. If she or he could understand you and sympathize with you in a kind of difficult situation; lay-off, illness, someone close’s passing. You would sense great relief which makes a marital life indomitable.

Second, and it would give us energy to get through hardship of life. Of course, both of two have mutual obligations to have faith in each other. Faith is a requisite for respect for minimum and fundamental private life. Sometime I’ve met with someone suspicious about everything. It was absolutely not a marriage, but she always phone called asking where I am. Actually, I have never, ever cheated on her. It was really choking me, and we, broke up with each other.

Third, the mankind is optically influenced easily; hence we cannot totally ignore an appearance of our nominee. However, the beauty for me is not only the outer beauty because sooner or later it will be abolished but inner beauty comes from the kindheartedness. You can easily imagine a marriage with your girlfriend with a lovely face who shows a villainous temper in every matter. Will you marry her? No, you will not. And I won’t too.

I guess women who read above until now are thinking I am so arrogant. I apologize if it sounded arrogant, as I said above. Of course, I also have to match me to my spouse. If I didn’t, it doesn’t matter how my spouse meets above requirements, since she cannot stand my unsuitableness during a marital life. Remember this. The bottom line is that your choice of spouse should be with prudence. But your marriage life with the ideal spouse depends on how you do.

====================================================

I would be lying if I did not admit that even though I have good, I want to leave the world a little better then when I came here. I want to be a doctor because I want to touch peoples’ lives and have their lives be better because I existed.

I have seen first hand how important medicine is. I have lost family and friends and I know that one of the greatest things that doctors can do is to give patients more time; more time to enjoy life

As an EMT I have witnessed the results of horrible accidents and as a volunteer in the ED of a trauma center I have literally seen doctors save lives and bring people back. From the very first time I was allowed to participate

1297125183.0,fh71v,I have to write a letter to my English teacher introducing myself. Can anyone read this and offer any recommendations?,iamthatis,4,1,2,"The letter is as follows. Is there any areas where you would recommend touching it up?

--------

Dear Ms. *Teacher*:
 
My name is *name*. I’d like to take this opportunity to introduce myself and allow you to see a clearer image of me as a student and an individual. I plan to do this by telling you of my strengths

I greatly enjoy the mathematical and scientific side of academics, step-wise thinker who tackles situations with a planned, regimented and often solitary approach. Because of this, I find I struggle with simply consuming information, and instead prefer to visualize concepts in examples and scenarios, such as considering off-beat or practical instances. In the long-term, this proves to be a much more fruitful strategy, but the concept as a whole becomes much more accessible and clear.

As a graduating student, a great deal of attention has to also be given to scholarship applications and university preparation, securing not only the present, but the future equally.

Creative writing and reading novels rank among my favorite aspects of English. From a very young age I have taken an interest in both reading stories and writing my own. As a result I feel this has improved my ability to communicate with people and convey points

I am hoping that my skills in English are improved across the board as I move closer toward graduation. Here’s hoping this gives you an insight into my goals and identity as a student as we commence this course. Thank you for taking the time to read this and I hope to hear back from you.

----------
Dear Sir or Madam:

My Name is XXXX XXXX and I’m a second year student doing a Bachelor in Software Engineering at the École Polytechnique de Montréal in Canada. I am writing to express my motivation in participating to the student exchange program at the City University of Hong Kong for a period of 1 year starting this fall 2011.

Last semester, which started with the following sentence: “Stay Hungry. Stay Foolish”. This sentence has been burnt in my mind ever since. The presentation went on by sharing experiences of fellow students who came back transformed from their exchange and right away, I knew that I wanted to be part of this project. 

It did not take me long to settle on the spectacular city of Hong Kong. Being open-minded, I have not had the chance to put a foot on the Asian continent and I feel I am still missing out on what are probably the most intriguing and fascinating societies on earth.

This year in your University will give me the occasion to not only visit this mysterious nation and fill this curiosity gap that has been gnawing me for so long, my morals, my mentality are highly influenced by the western perspective. And I feel unfortunate to not have been exposed to such a different culture from mine : I realize there is much more to the world than what I have been taught and I am appealing you to give me the chance to explore it.

The City University of Hong Kong satisfies everything I could ever wish from such an experience. Your prestigious university is situated in the center of what is possibly the most effervescent metro pole of the eastern world. The international fame of your university assures me a quality education and your formation oriented to the professional life is exactly what I am searching for. Studying at your faculty will undoubtedly help me extend my knowledge on some area in which your Department of Computer Science excels by its research

This project is an adventure of a lifetime and I am prepared to make every effort possible to substantiate it. I hope I am given the opportunity to have this challenging and enlightening period in your institution.

Thank you very much for considering my request. I am looking forward to your positive response. 

Yours sincerely
XXXX XXXX

In Finland, but found that it could not efficiently eradicate common health problems because a lack of resources available. The lack of efficiency is a possible explanation for the negative relationship. From 1970-1976, we observe a negative relationship between HCE and GDP, with HCE leading. Investment on HCE was substantial, and it was not until 1979 when the Occupational Health Care Act was established, which made employers provide mandatory health care services for employees. Thus, from 1979 on, 1992-1998 in the medium run, which reduced suicide rates to 18 per 100

We observe the feedback hypothesis in the short run, Iceland. All frequency bands begin with GDP leading HCE positively before 1972, and switch to HCE leading GDP later on. Post World War II, Iceland’s economy grew rapidly, roughly about a 4% annual increase. In addition, Ireland initially had barriers to trade, but these barriers were lifted after 1960. Following the 1970’s, allowing for better allocation of resources. Two important pieces of legislation include the 1971 Social Security Act and the 1973 Health Care Act passed by Parliament altered Iceland’s health care system. The 1971 Social Security Act specified that all of Iceland should be covered by one public health insurance scheme. Passed two years later, in the medium and long run, including the Act on Alcohol and Drug Prevention in 1998

GDP is consistently leading HCE in Norway. From the 1970’s to the 1990’s, which allowed the country to spend more on health care. In the medium run, GDP occurs to lead HCE from 2006-2010, and there is a positive correlation between the two variables. The continuous wavelet analysis did not fail to capture one of Norway’s most recent programs, called the Norwegian Centers of Expertise program. The purpose of this program is to stimulate business and economic growth, so this new establishment can explain the positive relationship between HCE and GDP, with GDP leading HCE. Additionally, called the Oslo Cancer Cluster, there is a negative correlation between HCE and GDP

Japan’s economy is widely studied for its miraculous economic recovery post World War II. Moreover, “kaihoken,” which started in 1961. Health care expenditure is extremely low, as it is composed of only 8.5% of GDP even though it has a high population of elderly people. The relationship between HCE and GDP is significant during the medium run for Japan during 1983-1986. During the 1980’s, even though health care spending rapidly grew among many countries, Japan was able to keep costs down as it had preset the fees for health care services every two years. In 1983, all of Japan’s elderly population was covered by government-sponsored health care insurance. Japan’s health care policy is more sophisticated than the average country’s. When a patient exhausts his monthly copayment, HCE leads GDP, it is HCE that leads GDP

	Ever since I was a little boy, but people, including parents and even coaches, had a preconceived idea of what was considered a good athlete. Not only was I not given a chance, but especially in my elementary school days, I was constantly belittled for my “disability.” This type of attitude toward me hardened me and shaped me into the person I am today. It became my life goal to prove these people wrong. And I did. 
	My favorite sport growing up was basketball, despite tearing up the B league, I was placed on the B level team. The rationale for it was that I was too small. 
	I was promised by the Freshman basketball coach at my high school that size wouldn't matter in high school, but the people changed. The politics of youth sports was no longer an issue. My height no longer was a frowned upon by the coaches and whoever played the best in practice would take the court during games. I was one of those guys.	
	Today, and garnered all league honors on the lacrosse team as well. The lesson that I have taken from this is that no one can tell you what you can or cannot do. It is central to my identity today and is the building block for the rest of my life.

I was always really bad at math..and.. homework. J not so much. On the first day of 7th grade, knocked on the wrong door, and we have been inseparable ever since. That was 16 years ago.

When I sat down to write this speech I became so overwhelmed at how much I wanted to say. When there are so many amazing things to say it’s almost impossible to choose. I can’t even begin to put into words how incredibly lucky I feel to have such an incredible best friend. I feel that we are soul mates in our own way. We have been through different colleges

We have done a lot of amazing things together. From Disney World 400 times and to visit her amazing family in Scotland ( shout out) and countless other places. We've been on stage together and swam with the dolphins. Those things are all great, and how our families have become each other’s families.

One of the things I love about J is how she will always fight for you, and she did not give up until he realized that she was the right girl. It might have taken P a while to realize J was the right girl since I'm pretty sure he didn't want the baggage of her crazy best friend, me. The first time I met P..we got off to a bit of a rough start. I nearly killed him going the wrong way down a one way street, then tried taking him to a park that didn’t even exist anymore. Despite all that I can say with all the sincerity in the world that he has become one of my best friends and favorite people.

J and P are an exceptionally awesome couple. There are not a lot like them. They open their home to me and others on a weekly basis, then P back to Boston when J got into Harvard. It’s that kind of love, and unwavering support that makes a marriage work.

Nationalism has two definitions as defined by Oxford dictionary, and the second is, an extreme version of definition one, often marked by a feeling of superiority over other nations.  I feel that we should only grasp nationalism up to the point were the second definition begins and never crossing into that feeling of superiority. Nationalism is a force that can provide amazing benefits to your nation but, when brought up to the level of the second definition, when it becomes a form of ultranationalism it can just as easily tear it down. When you start to feel superior to others, you start to treat them with less respect and often animosity, those patriotic feelings and actions, when you've gotten to the balancing point where you are gaining and no one is suffering


When Stalin came to power in the late 1920's he declared that all of Ukraine's farmland would become state owned and that people were to work on collective farms instead of their traditional way of life on regular farms, and he was, but his methods ended up killing thousands of Ukrainian people. Stalin overstepped the boundary from helping your own nation, into crushing another's nation. Stalin was building an empire, he was bettering his nation in many ways, and was even praised for it by  western news sources, but because he over stepped that boundary, and because he justified this act by implying the Ukrainians were 'less', but not all nationalist acts that end in violence began with good intentions. 


When the Hutu's rebelled against the Tutsi's there were no good intentions, you start to treat them worse, because of this many situations escalate to levels that are just unnecessary, if the Hutu's and Tutsi's had had their leaders sit down and discuss the issues and come to a conclusion, maybe using the U.N. as moderators, maybe their wouldn't have been almost one million deaths. Entering into a situation with hot blood and intense ultranationalistic feelings in your veins there will always be conflict. Loving your nation is fine, and working to better it is great


A lot of people think of Adolf Hitler and only remember the genocide of the Jewish people, I couldn't, do that. Hitler was ultimately a bad guy, he killed millions of people simply because they didn't fit his idea of a perfect world, but before he crossed that line, he started by trying to make his country better in other ways. He saw a country demoralized and left destroyed by the treaty of Versailles, he also saw a way to fix it, not just as a political and military force but also as a place for children and young men and women. There were clubs much like boy scouts and girl scouts, of a better,but as he took his views up to the level of that second definition


In conclusion nationalism is a good thing as long as it is never brought to the level of ultranationalism, if someone supported the Calgary Flames and another person supported the Edmonton Oilers both of these people can still sit down and discuss their love of hockey and the love they have for their respective teams without destroying each other and hurting everyone around them. People should be able to talk about how great of a place the world is and how we can make it better without hurting other people, of course that rivalry between nations will still be there, and that is fine, as long as it can be put aside when we need to solve global issues and find ways to make the planet better for everyone. The Hutu's thought they were better than the Tutsi's and ended up leaving a nation in turmoil. Stalin thought that making Russia a better place was more important than the well being of the Ukrainian people and he ended up remembered as a tyrant. When Hitler attempted to better his nation he took it to far by trying to eliminate the races he saw as worthless. We should accept nationalism as long as it doesn't harm anybody else, no matter what we think of them.",,,,

The Wooden Play Structure

My fondest memories from when I was young were the times I spent at an enormous playground at a school in Wilsonville then went to the nearby Willamette River with my family and the other daycare kids. My mom used to babysit


We left early in the morning, because it was always highly contested. Once I was tired of the swing, or yelled at enough that it was someone else's turn – it was time to move onto one of the other activities. 

Next, each team to one of the four towers that stood at opposing ends of the war zone. If we were hit by two balloons then we were out for that turn. The winning team was whoever had the last man standing. We started playing just as it was getting hot out, so even though getting hit by a balloon signaled defeat, the cool water splashing on us helped refresh us.  After about two turns it turned into an all-out war where no one was out anymore, just water balloons flying from every direction until we ran out.

 
On rare occasions, and spit fire at the knights. It looked amazing. We also did finger paintings of our favorite dinosaurs; mine was a Pterodactyl, soaring high above the rest of the dinosaurs. One time, we all made my mom a giant birthday card since her birthday was coming soon. We drew hearts, diamonds, and all of the kids hugging her, and then we all signed it. She was very surprised when we gave it to her and she really loved it. We all enjoyed the fare a lot; I wish it had been there more often.
	

There was also an undercover area where we played wall ball. The wall was massive, so he always won when we first started going there. But after a few years he stopped going and then it was down to my friend Taylor and me as contested champions. We had to let them play one on two to make it fair sometimes. We often spent hours challenging each other until we could barely breathe. It was so hot we could see the heat waves emanating off the asphalt, beads of sweat formed on our foreheads then dripped into our eyes. Although exhausted, we kept playing until it was time to leave for the park down the street.
	
In the afternoon we left for the nearby park. It always smelled of freshly cut grass and the nearby field of various flowers created a lovely aroma for miles. This is where my dad came to join us. We all ate our bagged lunches at the brown picnic tables while sitting in the shade to avoid the scorching heat. The food was never exciting, even if only for a little while.
	
After lunch we played on the metal see-saw
	
Eventually, even after the sun had gone down over the hill and we were blue in the lips. 

After that, but if we had it our way we would have played there much longer.

Extreme climate change has been occurring from the time of the industrial revolution and will continue happening if humans do not start a “green revolution” to tackle these problems. We know about the Earth’s solar radiation budget and how most energy is absorbed, the climate will keep changing and so will the Earth. It will have to deal with more energy being trapped in the atmosphere and this could adversely affect the Earth’s natural biomes.
	Continuing the discussion of the Earth’s solar radiation budget, but this is something humans can change and prevent.
	Furthermore, these absorb radiation from the Sun and emits it at a thermal infrared range which heats the Earth. Now they are not all that bad because we need these natural ones to support life on Earth without them Earth could not hold and absorb heat.
	



Regarding human activity and how it’s related to climate
As a consequence of global warming and climate change the earth will become warmer which could become disastrous for some areas and more welcome for others. Also this change in climate could cause more areas to have more precipitation and therefore make them wetter and some areas will become extremely dry with little to no precipitation which could cause extreme drought.  Also the greenhouse effect will increase due to the pollution by humans; the carbon dioxide that is polluted could help some crops and help them grow in large numbers. But on the other hand the heat from pollution could completely wipe out these crops because of their inability to adapt to fast changing climate change
Despite all of these significant consequences there are things we can do to help slow down this process of global warming and climate change. First of all we could use more sustainable power plants and limit the use of power plants like coal which are extremely inefficient and produce tonnes upon tonnes of pollution. Examples of these alternative power sources could be wind, also we can simply plant more trees to offset climate change. Lastly as I recall the from the movie The Inconvenient Truth there was an idea to increase the albedo effect of cities by literally painting them white to reflect more solar radiation back out to outer space.




Having considered climate
In addition to climate and its relationship with biomes
For this reason all of these articles information are related in multiple ways through the relationship between biomes and how they are related to the climate and solar energy in the ways of temperature and precipitation. Also climate change and global warming can have a negative effect on individual and distinct biomes by either destroying them or creating new ones to support new species. Carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases will have an effect on the global warming on earth which will affect these biomes also.  Finally the solar budget of earth which is how much solar radiation the earth absorbs and reflects the budget will see an increase in the area of absorption due to the increased manmade greenhouse gas pollution by the burning of several hydrocarbons.

My personal design process is based around the belief that architectural process is not linear but a series of natural circular processes that are based on information, the task is to eliminate and get all the possibilities out, while creating language, spatial identity and cite context. As the process moves forward it also moves back, when certain solutions fail, emerging explorations begin to be tweaked based on the previous schemes and past explorations. The result is an expansion from logical to associative coherence in a natural circular pattern where one language feeds of another. In the case of the nature center and parker elementary school, a language of contrast was explored in order to create geometry that reflected the usage of two different groups of people. The nature center was created by the push and pull of the visitors. The visitors who used the trails and where familiar with the cite where encouraged to move faster thru the building while having partial access to  the interior context, what makes up 21st century learning

1)The Houston arboretum project was based on the idea of conflicting concepts and how they can become a single balanced environment within the architecture.
The building programs were analyzed and an ideal fast and slow circulations paths where created. This paths allowed the program to interact with an “external force” depending if the program was more important to the bike path or pedestrian path. the programs that interacted with  the fast moving circulation where forced to “stick” out of the ground, this created a building that had a violent contrast in geometry depending on the location of the visitor.

2)Houston is made up of many different types of cultures and this project shows a repose to the Houston environment and incites alternative methods of design. As the project began we were given the assignment of researching various cultures and its characters in design. From the research I created two concepts that reflected ambiguity and one that reflected clarity

3)Arts place museum was influenced on the personal idea that film and art should be experienced individually and in close proximity. With the idea of individualism various modular spaces were created. Each of the modules offered a singular experience according to the transparency and location within the building. This idea of a personal experience evolved into an architectonic response of creating a space about discovery, but the staggering and missing units change the environment from floor to floor. The difference in transparencies in glass bathe and dance with the cold polish concrete shell. The structural elements of the project also play a key import feature in the design. The close proximity of the columns accentuate the modules and allow for a thin two way concrete slab to be used as a structure system . This relatively thin floor slabs accentuates the large glass panels and light that bathes the panels 

4)The approach to this project was to search what in architecture could affect a musician and listener. What are the aspects which affect the artistic the expression of a child learning music? As conceptualization began the concept of space a musician creates through music was interpreted as space full of color and a well establish rhythm. This idea of color and a datum drove the design process.The simple building geometry contrasted heavily to the activity in the interior, and allows the movement and noise created by the kids to become part of the building, thus creating a moving façade. The relationship between music and architecture can also be seen in plan and the idea of weaving the music classroom into the everyday life. As in music a strong datum was created allowing the building to have a colorful and engaging interior. The datum became the learning corridor as research into 21st century learning was used, this corridor serves as a clear story bringing light to the interior while the music classrooms are allowed to extend to the space and begin to dance as musical notes in a sheet.

1369669526.0,1f53uc,Help with a short essay about Syria,mintyandhoggo,4,1,1,"Edit: I've never posted here before

**Background to current problems**

Syria has been ruled for decades by an Islamic sect called The Alawites, where the leading Sunni party has committed atrocious acts against the minority Coptic Christian population).

The Alawites receive external support from Iran

The previous dictator of Syria, leaving his second son, Bashar al-Assad, to take power. He held this role fairly comfortably up until the “Arab Spring” protests in 2011, which is where the current conflict started to evolve.

Most countries dealt with the Arab Spring protestors in a way which would be unthinkable in the Western world, many Syrian people decided they could take the opportunity to attempt to overthrow the dictatorship once-and-for-all. This led to rebel groups forming, who initially used makeshift weapons against al-Assad’s greatly superior artillery and air forces. Many other Syrian people attempted to flee the country, which led to hundreds of thousands of refugees flooding into Turkey (which is not a supporter of the Syrian regime for many historical reasons).

This fighting has slowly developed into a full-scale civil war


**Who else is involved?**

The people fighting on a daily basis started out as Syrian government forces against Syrian civilians. However

External forces were initially welcomed into the ranks of the rebels but it has become clear that a large number of these new recruits are jihadists

The Syrian government army have also been joined by external forces, who are based in Lebanon and receive backing from Syria and Iran, consists of Shi’ite Muslims who are committed to fighting against Western countries and their allies (particularly Israel). This means that two organisations which are recognised as terrorists in the UK and US are now fighting against each other in what started as a Syrian civil war.

The current conflict is unique in some way because of the fact that there has not been an invasion, which could then be a possible catalyst for invasion.

Syria is one of a handful of countries which refused to sign the “Chemical Weapons Convention” and they originally denied they held any chemical weapons. However in 2012 they admitted holding stocks of various chemical weapons

Israel is the only country who has directly attacked Syria recently. On 5th May 2013


**Possible outcomes**

The turmoil in Syria is constantly changing and there are too many variables to accurately predict what will happen next. There are some more recent fears that fighting in and around the Golan Heights (an area between Israel and Syria which was seized by Israel in 1967 and has been controlled by them ever since) will cause Israel to become gradually more involved in the war.

Most commentators think that the US will avoid getting embroiled in the conflict for numerous reasons .The main concern is that Syria is more heavily armed than other countries (such as Libya), but this has been silently condemned by many countries because it will make any possible foreign intervention much more difficult.

Therefore it seems likely that the conflict will continue long into the future, is that volatile warzones like this can easily allow fundamentalist terrorist groups to grow and gain various weapons.

The ideal solution for all parties (particularly the UK and US) would be a cessation of the war and an elected leader

Unfortunately

With a smile the goddess added ears that gave a pleasantly impish look to her new formed man.  Now the goddess placed her lips over the cold lips of her still cloud man.  She breathed a lifetime of wishes into her creation.  As she did so she felt her own soul lighten and the man form stirred in her arms.
	The goddess stepped back and observed her companion in dismay.  Her man was indeed beautiful but he blinked uncomprehendingly at the stars around him and his wonderfully articulated limbs moved in a clumsy and disjointed fashion.  The goddess called to him but his ears did not hear.  The wishes pulsed beneath his skin in a chaotic tumult.  He could not order his own life force.

        John F. Kennedy officially created the American Peace Crops on March 1, volunteer agencies and other industries to help him in his attempt to progress the world. His dedication to the corps made it what it is today and helped the growth of American humanitarianism. Americans were impressively quick to dedicate their lives in order to advance the lives of others. John F. Kennedy noted the pride he had for his country in his first announcement of the Peace Corps. (Kennedy, John F.)
       Initially, news titles such as “Young Wilmette Man Leaves For Ghana” and “Graduate To Teach with Peace Corps in Ghana” were in local newspapers to promote the new establishment and to boast about the brave and willing volunteers (Peace Corps World Wide). America’s positive response to the trip to Ghana revealed a pride for their countries willingness to help others, and spread the do-good attitude to make the country a better place. John F. Kennedy hoped to create and advance peace between America and other countries. By doing this he bettered America along the way. The people of America began volunteering for many mission trips in countries like Canada, Australia, France, Britain and Japan. Kennedy spoke to Americans about fighting tyranny, poverty and disease; doing this increased American humanitarianism. (Coleman
        The Peace Corps now has greatly developed as a program and changed America as a country. From 1961 to modern day, there have been over 210,000 volunteers that have served in 139 countries. The growth of the Peace Corps from 1961 to now is evident and will continue to increase as the program continues to prosper (Peace Corps). America has become a better, and more united country with the development of the Peace Corps. Kennedy told Americans they must pledge their “best efforts to help them (third world countries) help themselves.” Obeying this, Americans fell to action and have yet to stop helping the world outside of their own. (Coleman, David G.) The dedication of American volunteers shows how the Peace Corps has impacted the entire country.

**I have numbered each of the paragraphs to make referencing easy if you would care to comment**

[Here is a Google Doc version](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OIRhVpTKsAijijjVGOjAuzUtaWFUwAUe_jd8ZksWtKY/edit?usp=sharing)



**1.**

In the fast pace of American culture, when Robin Williams learns you can speak in ways beyond words. There is something that communicates much deeper than words could ever, it is human connection. 
	
**2.**

Humans can connect on a spectrum ranging from superficial to the realization of the oneness between humans. Conversation is important, but people will never forget how you made them feel.”  I believe this holds true on a universal level, further justifying the potential that human connection can have. 

**3.**
The opening lines of the sacred Tao te Ching read “Those who speak do not know, and listen. Hear the symphony of life resonate on your ear drums. The Universe is an orchestra that is performing its’ infinite composition, and you have the best seat in the house. It is the song of living in this exact moment. It is always going on within you and around you. By practicing mindfulness, simply sitting and listening can be one of the greatest joys found in this existence. Simply being, and listening.

**4.**

Would you believe me if I said my greatest inspiration is also one of the most intimidating forces in my life? Picture a boy, how is one supposed to develop? The hand dealt to this boy is not a fair one, but that is irrelevant. Through the beautiful working of the Universe, my path crossed with this boy. 

**5.**

Under a blanket of mental illness, there lies the most beautiful soul I know. This boy lives each day expressing himself without the tool of language. This is not to say he cannot communicate, but rather the rules of the game of communication are rewritten. Researchers state that up to 80% of communication is nonverbal. Body language, posture, awareness of anxiety and nervous tension all make up the vibration of the setting. Rather than a conversation, we share a vibration. It allows for expression of our mood, troubles on our minds, and good times to share. 

**6.**

**Some people fear mental illness.** Stigma exists, all of the time. Rather than getting caught up in simple petty talk, he is able to embrace the flow of the universe, unhindered by language.

**7**

**Inspired by social relations and therapeutic measures, and notice your gut feelings to interpret what to do. Healthcare allows for the working out of the “Golden Rule”. 

**8**

This art of psychotherapy goes beyond the work realm of life. **Psychotherapy actually applies in nearly every situation of life.** Every interaction with someone is a chance to play the game. The therapist/patient relationship may be equated to a battle. Psychology is a set of weapons. The enemy is the ego. The battlefield is the mind. Combat skills come in the form of acceptance, they are nothing real. 

**9**

I am the one who has truly been blessed from this work. I am the one who has gained the power of silence. While in public, and it will continue with or without your verbal input. The more and more I discover the beauty of being silent, the more I understand the Buddha’s noble silence.

**10**

How humorous it is to hear peoples’ arguments escalate, the chemical rush one gets from socialization. **I find the power of silence to bring a greater rush.** The feeling that everything is happening here and now for a reason, and that a carefully chosen silence and smile can serve as a better response than a thousand words.

Thank you for reading :)

This essay is for entrance into a[ summer political communications](http://www.emerson.edu/academics/professional-studies/programs-high-school-students/political-communication-program) program at Emerson. 

The topic of the essay is: In one or two pages

Im looking for any help i can get

TEXT VERSION BELOW

Please state what you hope to achieve during the institute. and an event you feel has prepared you for the institute

   From the time I had become aware of the Political Communications program at Emerson College I knew it was a perfect fit for both my experiences and my goals. Since childhood I have developed a great interest in both politics and the role of language in shaping and conveying ideas. The summer program at Emerson focuses on how communication effects government, as it would be another opportunity to help hone my skills for a future in public office. I have both the preparation and the dedication to succeed at a program such as this one.
	
   My experiences, Organizing for America. It was my job to solicit donations by phone from registered Democrats in order to further aid the campaign. Another responsibility I fulfilled was getting out the vote/canvassing, I did this by going door to door and offering voter information as well as gathering information to further aid the local campaign. My most rewarding task as part of Organizing for America was to register new voters. It was a privilege to assist people in exercising their First Amendment rights. 
	
   My interest in politics is also expressed in my academic choices. In 7th grade I took a government course in which I earned an “A”. As a 9th grader I challenged myself by taking an AP Human Geography course in which I am also excelling. Acquiring good communication skills is another ability I have developed by electing a journalism class. This class provides me the abiliity to write for my school newspaper, while also being able to write my own editorial pieces. This year, I have also chosen to run for student office so that I may help my school while also acquiring valuable leadership techniques. Additionally, my dedication and interest in politics can be seen on my bookshelf as well. In order to further shape my political beliefs while also providing me with a better understanding of government, I have chosen to read read literature such as Animal Farm, Atlas Shrugged, All the Kings Men, while also helping me better understand what effective writing is.
.

   Furthermore, something I am especially interested in. Honing my persuasion, and speech skills is also a task I greatly look forward to, as they are some of the most important tools, not just in politics but in life.The program will also give me a chance to visit and explore a historic city: Boston. I have never had the privilege of visiting the city, however I am aware of its historic and cultural significance to America (say something about the bombings) and would love the opportunity to visit its many historic sites. Above all, the program will help prepare me for a career in politics. In the future I will be able to build on this experience as it will help me acquire the skills needed to better serve my city, or country

205. The dangers that beset the evolution of the philosopher are, that one might doubt whether this fruit could still come to maturity. The extent and towering structure of the sciences have increased enormously, and therewith also the probability that the philosopher will grow tired even as a learner, or will attach himself somewhere and ""specialize"" so that he will no longer attain to his elevation, that is to say, to his superspection, his circumspection, when the best of his maturity and strength is past, so that his view, a millepede

1361150521.0,18q1b5,If you read youll see there are comment in the essay but i do not understand ,js2qt2bstr88t,3,0,3,"My Identity as a Student
My educational history feels almost non-existent, but your wording and sentence structure is much better than your first draft. You do have a “comma splice” in the first line you need to fix.)
One way my educational history has helped shape the student I am now is through suffering and the hurt from having parents who abused drugs, (comma splice here) if I didn’t there would be hell to pay. My mother was seventeen when she had us, I say us because I have an identical twin sister, Carita. We were brought home from the hospital to our grandmother’s house, where we lived until we were about two years of age. My mother decides (do you mean decided?) to go to a truck stop, where she would hitch a ride with one of the truckers, and go on a road trip wherever he was going. They would party the whole trip. We never knew where we were going, our grandmother was very angry and started yelling and screaming at my mother. This only made my mother pack our stuff and leave my grandmother’s. My mother and father decided to take off; they put us in the back seat of his 57 Chevy where they had put a play pin (playpen) in the back instead of the seats (you have no punctuation here and it is the end of the sentence) we ended up in Ozark Missouri. My father got a farm house. We had a horse named Charlie, only ending up with black eyes and busted lips ourselves. My parents  would go out to parties, Rita
I was physically abused when I was four; I stopped speaking to everyone but my sister. I would whisper in her ear and she would get whatever I asked her for. When we started school we were in the same class, until we were back together and I continued to whisper in my sister’s’ ear. School just did not seem to fit into my mother’s schedule, (another comma splice here) while I should have been leaning my ABCs, (no comma needed )I was at home with mom learning how to smoke weed instead. If I got lucky, and mom wasn’t sick or hung-over I might have been able to go to school, but that was not often. 
 Our father soon passed away when we were eleven, all I did was party with my mom and run the streets. Until someone called the social workers on her (this is confusing), they were getting ready to take us away. (Who is “they”? And do you mean “they” were getting ready to take you away until someone called the social workers or after?)That’s when I ended up on my grandmother’s front lawn, where my mom dropped me off and never came back. I got lots (a lot) of post cards and promises of visits that never came. My grandmother tried to get me to go to school and have a curfew, but I was already out of control. I did whatever I wanted whenever I wanted.  I was angry at the world, always asking why? Couldn’t it have been my mom?  When I was fourteen I was already on the wrong side of the law stealing cars, doing drugs, I was even shot five times in the back, even though it is an incredible one of overcoming obstacles.)
Another way my educational history has helped shape my identity as a student is going to prison. At first it was cool; I met better criminals, and I sure did not want to be there, but I guess it’s exactly what I needed. I knew I wanted something different for myself, so I had to do some serious thinking. In prison I asked myself a few questions. Is this what my life is all about? Is this what I want? Is this who I am or who I want to be? No, it was not, (comma splice) I had to be real honest with myself. I asked myself,  “Where else is there better to start but right here?” It all started with me and my choices. I was scared to death, and that was very frightening for me
 The most important thing that has helped shape me in to (into) the student I am today is my daughter Sosha,(end the sentence here).  I have been here in Marysville ever since he was born. I have now registered at  Yuba College,  first for the financial aid thinking it was going to be easy, but I was wrong. I sure was not prepared for becoming a college student.  I still have a lot of obstacles to overcome and challenges to face, while shaping my identity as a college student. My daughter and I have since gotten a three bedroom house together to start a new life. I still have a lot of goals I would like to reach. My first one is to continue my education here at Yuba College. (this is a fragment – remember to put a comma after college and then continue the sentence) so I may graduate and start working on a career. I have not decided what I want  to prepare for or study  , but I will soon.  My goal is to  get out of this class  everything it has to offer .I want to do the best I can to pass with confidence, so I will be ready for the next level of English. As for now I just want to keep learning. One of the things I have already learned in this class is what kind of mindset I have.
In the article“Brainology” by Carol Dweck, profiting from mistakes, (comma splice) these are some ways of getting smarter” ( 2) Having a growth mindset pushes me toward reaching my goals until I get them.
 	We also read about “When Capable Students Fail” by Katie Hern.  No page until you actually use something from the article. I definitely can relate to this
My husband use to say the only stupid question is one not asked. It made me wonder what he really meant by that

1360812321.0,18hopp,Gun Control ,KushBoy420,3,0,3,"In 2012 there were a total of 14 mass shootings that took place in the United States alone. That is a very large number in comparison to previous years. Some say that this is a ploy from government to get citizens to stray away from their constitutional rights. Others stand strong by their constitutions and continue to practice the right to bear arms. Most recent of these public horror incidences was the Sandy Hook Elementary shooting in Newtown, I believe it is a basis in our constitution to bear arms and should be reserved
	With over 14 mass-shooting this year alone, says, “I can tell you that [Obama] is going to have a bill to lead on, because it’s a first day bill I’m going to introduce in the Senate, and the same bill will be introduced in the House – a bill to ban assault weapons. It will ban the sale, the transfer, the importation and the possession, but prospectively. And it will ban the same for big clips
	George Will of the Washington Post wrote, killed 16 5- and 6-year-olds and the teacher. A few years ago in Norway, a young — deranged young man killed, what, 69 people on an island, mostly teenagers. Connecticut has among the toughest gun laws in this country. Didn’t help. Scotland and Norway have very tough gun laws. Didn’t help. So… We did — remember, we did — we did have a ban — we did have a ban on assault weapons. When we put the ban in place, they didn’t increase in a measurable way.” That being said, only four of those were done with assault weapons. How would banning assault weapons stop the other ten incidences from happening in the future? It not the assault weapon’s law that needs to change. Rather, “We cannot turn our back and say that violence in films or anything that we do doesn’t have a sort of influence. It does.” This is true especially when the people committing these violent acts are often portrayed as heroes in a glorious light. There needs to be proper education and possibly a change in the media so that not every situation needs to end in a violent shoot out.
Some may feel that the only way to stop a bad man with a gun is a good man with a gun. After the Sandy Hook tragedy, locked up, so when she heard gunfire she pulls it out … and takes him out, takes his head off before he can kill those precious kids.” Particularly enough, a lot of people agree with Gohmert. Some activists push for added assault weapons, more as a defense mechanism from the extremists. As wild as Louie’s statement may seem this is a better solution as an alternative to Dianne Feinstein said earlier. A criminal with a mind set to kill has no regard for a gun law so miniscule compared to the law that he or she will be breaking killing any number of innocent people.
In my past experience my mother was never one to let any of my brothers or I play with guns. We weren’t even aloud to have them in the house. With that being said, those people would know the dangers and understand the precautions of having guns. You may think that not knowing anything about guns is a good thing but if somebody like me, with little gun knowledge were to become angry enough they could essentially have access to guns just as easily as someone whose parents have guns. 
As far as gun control goes

1360031947.0,17wpos,[Request] I am doing an essay for an internship and I would like to have some feedback on it.,hispanica316,5,1,3,"These are the questions I have to answer.

What is your personal motivation to apply for the HACU National Internship Program?

What are your academic and/or career goals?

What skills can you bring to an employer and what skills would you like to focus on throughout the internship?

My personal motivations to apply for this internship program include:

• Get professional experience in the fields that I am majoring in (accounting and finance). In this world’s competitive market having experience in my field of study with a very good company before I graduate would make me more appealing to potential employers and put me one step ahead of the competition

• Test how I would cope with being away from my family. Being from a Mexican family where family is pretty much the most important thing

• I set a goal for myself to get an internship in 2013 with HACU so that I can get unique insights in my field of study and network with people from other parts of the world

My career goal is to get my CPA and then work as an auditor or financial analyst in the FBI and be able to provide this agency the tools it needs to make its’ job easier and faster. I want to be able to catch people laundering money to contribute my grain of sand to this country which has given me so much. My academic goal is to graduate with a double major in accounting and finance with a concentration in financial analysis with a GPA &gt;3.00 and after that get my CPA certification.

I bring employers a different perspective into problems, where I also learned that being bilingual (like myself) is particularly important and useful specially living in a border town like I do.

During my internship I would like to focus on leadership skills, better than when I first arrived there.

However, they did attempted to suppress it with what they believed was practical.

For the most part, they simply ignored all of the threats that I had received from my siblings. The insults intensified with age, but I eventually found a way to cope with it. I found a sense of direction.

Editor’s Note

As the New Year dawns upon us, we will strive to improve upon every issue. 

There are many changes happening in Nha Trang. The construction we see everywhere is giving the city a major facelift, while the city steps enthusiastically into modernity, its cultural persona remains visibly attached to the past. There is a noticeable dichotomy between this pursuit of advancement and the humble traditions and customs that make up the Vietnamese way of life. The swelling ranks of young adults are helping to power the economy along, while the older generation reminds us of the history, principles and cultural philosophy that permeate every aspect of life here. 

Often frenetic and bustling, mountains, islands and blue sea. Within this frame, the toil, industry and smiling faces of the city’s inhabitants prove to be a veritable microcosm of Vietnam itself- wholly conscious of its roots, while eagerly anticipating its new and improved future. 

Our featured article explores the rich culture Tet Festival (Vietnamese New Year). For the local population, we wish you all a happy, lucky and prosperous 2013.

Violent movies and video game pose a negative impact on developing minds in young children. How children turn out to be is biased on how they were raised. Behavior is shaped by positive and negative reinforcement. Personality is not baised on genes, the minds of children are very easily molded into what they grew up with.

 Most kids are introduced to violent movies and video games between the ages of 6-8. Parents see this as a great way to distract their kids for many hours so they can have some free time; This is ideal for for busy parents. Most of them don't realize anything is wrong with this until their kids become violent individuals as they mature. The minds of children are essentially like play-dough

Most families see violence in video games and movies as mindless fun. Also they tend to purchase these items to give to their kids and promote the learning of these negative traits. Since kids see these graphic and violent images on TV they begin to think that it's okay to treat people like they do on TV. Robert Zajonc(1923-2008) a psychologist looked at the relationship between feeling and thought; led to his discovery of the ""mere exposure effect"". Zajonc stated that "" the repeated exposed to a stimulus breed familiarity with it. Familiarity brings about an attitude change towards a stimulus taking the form of preference or affection. This preference is emotional and forms on a subconscious level before the person is even aware of it"". Therefore with a negative stimulus it can change the attitude or personality of an individual and promoting negative actions.




Some studies indicate violent films and television do not increase a child's tendancy towards violence. Some studies even indicate that exposed to violence can actually decrease the amount of agression in children. This is known as the Catharsis effect. It suggests that some individuals can relate to the characters and release negative feelings thereby becoming less aggressive personally. Other psychologists view television as a form of education, if they are positive characters. This subject is extremely controversial because some psychologists do no believe in this effect. Albert Bandura, a renowned psychologist for his studies in developmental psychology, stated that the environmental experiences combined with violent media increases the chances for more aggressive individuals; especially children. 


Violent video games and films often promote aggression in children. Therefore, their biggest influences, television and video games will greatly affect the people they will become.",,False,,t5_2s6rw,,http://www.reddit.com/r/Proofreading/comments/13dgvv/can_somebody_please_edit_my_argumentative_essay/

Albert Einstein once said, to his curiosity of the universe. Although I do not claim to be as talented as Einstein was, I do share his need to understand how different systems work together.

While researching and writing the essay, I realized this is where my passion lies; this is what I want to do. From then I decided that I would pursue a graduate degree dealing with computers.

After graduating from Civil Engineering, I went online to find more information on the available courses. I looked at the courses that interested me, and found their prerequisites. There were a few classes that I would require, and am starting these in the fall semester.

Next, I decided to pursue the certification. After studying for two months, I was able to pass the tests and became A+ Certified.

After I had learned all I could about the hardware, starting with Java. This also allowed me to decrease the time I need for the undergraduate classes and start taking graduate classes in January.

While learning about the new degree program, I would enjoy working with the Center for Cognitive and Ubiquitous Computing. It would allow me to pursue my passion as well as help others in need.

Just as Einstein was able to make new discoveries

Essay Prompt: Describe your decision making process in choosing physical therapy as a career choice versus other health care careers

I knew I wanted to go into healthcare, to chiropractor, to pharmacist, or even physician. In the end, though, the field of physical therapy brought together all the qualities I was looking for in my career. It combines my love of teaching, my fascination with the study of movement

I first became interested in physical therapy as a profession after I started doing CrossFit. CrossFit is an exercise program that is based on workouts that consist of constantly varied, including Olympic lifts, sprints, bodyweight exercises, rowing, gymnastics training, and more. As I started practicing these diverse exercises, I started thinking back to what I had learned in previous anatomy courses about the body's form as it relates to function. I was fascinated with the realization that these small motor problems can often lead to major injuries. Moreover, and pain-free range of motion. Throughout my CrossFit experience, and loving it. I knew that teaching others how to improve themselves had to be a major part of my future career. 

Having come to this decision, injuries, modalities, and styles of communication. I remember one patient who was unable to walk due to a traumatic hip injury. Not only was she injured physically, but also psychologically due to her loss of mobility, independence, and ability to work. This patient made a fantastic recovery by the end of my internship. A lot of credit goes to the patient for putting in the work, but the physical therapist provided help and support when the patient struggled. When I think of the adversity I have faced in my life

When I think of the qualities that I admire in a professional, compassionate, kind, knowledgeable, sociable, and patient come to mind. These traits are apparent with every physical therapist I have shadowed. I try to demonstrate these qualities through my actions. By volunteering since 2010 at an organization that sorts medical supplies for third world countries, I show kindness and responsibility. By volunteering to help hospice patients, sociability, goals,

Secondly, how did their decisions make their  communities more or less sustainable?

Essay:
       
In May of 1787, conflicts between the states began to arise after the Revolutionary War which the weak federal government could not solve adequately. It was clear to the delegates that the Articles needed some serious revision and early on in the convention they decided that it would be best to write a new constitution altogether.         
        James Madison of Virginia designed and wrote a plan for a new central government which came to be known as the “Virginia Plan”. Although it would be significantly modified, he had already gained knowledge through his various political experiences. Madison had been a delegate at the Virginia Convention, become a member of the Continental Congress, served on the Council of State in Virginia, and served in the Virginia House of Delegates twice. While in the Virginia state legislature, he became known as the protégé of Thomas Jefferson. Their friendship and scholarliness helped Madison further form his ideas about government. Through their sharing of ideas and books, Madison gained greater knowledge of government systems along with a variety of other subjects. This, made him a knowledgeable leader at the Constitutional Convention.

Although the Virginia Plan was approved by the convention early on, often in creative and innovative ways. One such conflict was about the states’ representation in the legislative branch. Madison’s Virginia Plan proposed representation based on population in the lower and upper houses. Though this idea was greatly approved of by larger states; smaller states felt this would leave their voices unheard and drowned out by the large states, they instead wanted equal representation. In response to the conflict, Roger Sherman stepped up and attempted to resolve it through a compromise. His proposal stated that the House of Representatives be based on population and that the Senate have equal representation from each state. Although his proposal would resolve the issue of representation, the convention rejected it. However, Sherman’s idea was not forgotten,  and he showed valuable leadership traits such as the ability to resolve conflict and the ability to be creative by coming up with a solution that had previously been unheard of.  Though it didn’t initially receive approval

The rejection of Sherman’s proposal led William Peterson to counter the Virginia Plan with the New Jersey Plan. Unlike the Virginia Plan

Oliver Ellsworth soon led a motion which proposed equal representation in the upper house and popular representation in the lower house. The result of the proposal was a tie and a committee was formed to come up with a compromise. They were to find a solution to the issue about representation and if the country should be more national or more federal. Elbridge Gerry of Massachusetts was on the committee along with George Mason of Virginia and William Paterson of New Jersey. Gerry recognized that they needed “to put theoretical niceties to one side…and think about ‘accommodation’ ” (Lloyd). 

The Gerry Committee was urged to accept the compromise over representation but there were a few, “neither the same Nation nor different Nations. If no compromise should take place,” Gerry asked “what will be the consequence?” (Lloyd). Although Gerry was originally a supporter of a wholly national system, he realized that the priority of the committee was to move forward and come to a decision, regardless if it was not exactly in accordance with his personal views. Mason also agreed that, “there must be some accommodation” (Lloyd). They agreed to accept a partially national, partially federal compromise if popular representation was agreed upon as necessary for taxation. Paterson pushed the Committee to agree to the terms of the compromise because there simply “was no other ground of accommodation” (Lloyd). The compromise, was finally accepted thanks to the delegates’ sense of priorities.

The delegates’ decision to divide power amongst three separate branches of government and, created a system where each branch of government had limited power and where the assembly of a majority was difficult. Regardless of the fact that they had established a system of majority government, the Framers of the Constitution did not want assembly of the majority to be an easy task. They feared this would cause instability and consequently a system which was not sustainable. The Framers also realized that in order for the government to be stable and durable, there also needed to be some distance between the masses and the “levers of power”. Under the Constitution, the governing majority is made up of representatives of the people, not the combined capacity of the people themselves. This keeps the government from fluctuating as quickly as public opinion and helps assure {writers block}.

Another aspect of the Constitution which has proved to be an asset to its sustainability is the difficulty involved in making amendments. Since the time of its ratification, which was created immediately after the Constitution and was concurrent with it. The complexity of amendment makes the government less susceptible to rapidly changing times and ever-changing political theories and ideas. It asserts a certain level of concreteness, giving the public ease through the years that they can count on a sustainable system.

The delegates of the Constitutional Convention, most notably their in-depth knowledge, their sense of priorities and commitment, their innovative creativity, and their ability to resolve conflicts, they were able to design a constitution which has endured over two hundred years of war, political unrest, changing times and yet has remained a solid,,

1336353129.0,tahba,Can You Proofread My Discussion Project on the Book Frankenstein by Mary Shelley?,Skankalite,3,0,3,"This is for an 11th grade English Class.  Specifically

**Discussing the parent-child relationships present in the novel:**

One prevalent theme in the book Frankenstein by Mary Shelley is the theme of parental responsibility.  Shelley addresses this theme throughout the book by contrasting the manner in which Victor Frankenstein was raised and how Victor treated his own creation.  The idea that children are completely innocent and it is their parents’ duty to instill happiness within them is presented towards the beginning of the book.  Victor described himself as “their [Victor’s parents] child, Victor responded with immediate disgust and hatred.  He “… dreaded to behold this monster…” (Shelley 47).  This reaction caused Victor to run away in fear from his creation.

Shelley continues to develop the theme of parental responsibility when the true killer of Victor’s brother, […] I ought to render him happy before I complained of his wickedness” (Shelley 88-89).  The monster justified his murder as an act of revenge against his creator for not fulfilling his parental duties.  At the end of his tale, the monster asked Victor to create a female specimen like him to be his companion in life.  Victor, however, could not bare the thought of having two unnatural creations walking the earth because of him.  He vowed “… never will I create another like yourself [the monster], equal in deformity and wickedness“ (Shelley 157).  Consequentially, the monster killed those most dear to Victor

Throughout the book, “That is also my victim! […] Oh, Frankenstein! […] What does it avail that I now ask thee to pardon me?  I, who irretrievably destroyed thee by destroying all thou lovedst.  Alas!  He is cold, he cannot answer me” (Shelley 209).  The feeling of remorse and need to be forgiven clearly shows that the monster was able to fathom the extremity of his misdeeds.  Thus, the question is raised:  how much blame should be placed on Victor and his monster?  Victor willingly chose to create his monster, but abandoned it and treated it with disdain and hatred, as Shelley claimed all children do. This innocence is shown when the monster says, the monster was not inherently evil, both his and the monster’s life would probably have turned out differently.  Failing to fulfill his parental responsibility of providing love and happiness to his Victor’s creation is what led to both his and the monster’s demise

**Discussing Victor’s “ethical dilemma” regarding the promise he made to his creature:**

Mary Shelley used Victor Frankenstein to address the philosophical and ethical debate between consequentialism and non-consequentialism in her novel Frankenstein.  In the novel, the monster could go on another vengeful rampage.  Also, if the two had children, Victor would be responsible for a new race of unnatural beings walking the earth.  The opposing argument is the side of non-consequentialism, which claims that an action is either right or wrong in and of itself, regardless of the outcome.  It is unlikely that, even if Victor followed non-consequentialism, since Victor considered his monster “… a demon whose delight is in death and wretchedness…” (Shelley 157).  Therefore, it is possible that this death and sorrow would have been avoided.  However, Shelley was trying to give.  No matter what

 My dream is to become a Veterinarian that can do more than just sell shots and prescriptions. With my eyes set on a College of Veterinary Medicine, requires a profound understanding of mathematics and sciences. Veterinary colleges, as well, are said to be hard to get into because of the many applicants and scarce number of these colleges. As there are no Colleges of Veterinary Medicine near my home, I must prepare myself to have to live quite a distance away from home if I do get accepted. This program can help me get ahead in fields essential to my dream and can give me the invaluable experience of living at a college dorm. ",,False,t5_2s6rw,True

&gt;The dark, eerie feeling in the very core of one’s body. The fleeting moment, during which your racing heart beats faster and faster as if trying to rip free of its pinfold. The moment when you feel a piercing cold grab onto your shoulder creating a split second of sheer terror as your heart sinks. The moment when you realize that it’s over.
&gt;
&gt;“Got ya!” He laughed breathlessly. 
&gt;
&gt;I was too over exhausted to argue. Though it didn’t matter because it seemed as if I was the last one left, the umbrage stated otherwise. As we began the journey home the other players had caught up to us on our way back, joining in the array of laughter, and boasting of their great feats of cunning and furtiveness. Looking back on it, it did not matter if I had won or lost, but at that moment, the triumph had tasted as sweet as anything I’d ever tasted. Soon thereafter, feeling content about the way the day had gone.
&gt;
&gt;As I was walking up the creaking cedar porch, with tears swelling in her blue eyes. She had been fine just this morning; there had to have been a letter. She brought me inside the familiar cottage house, with the single buzzing light bulb suspended in the middle of the room. The floorboards let out a creak with every step, as if warning us as to what’s about to happen. At the end of the room, my brother was seated on the opposite side of the table. The next ten minutes had been near stagnant. Each second had crept behind the other as the methodically slow clock ticked away. The seemingly never-ending moment had concluded with words that had beaten all breath out of me.
&gt;
&gt;“We’re moving to Canada.”
&gt;
&gt;The words echoed in my head, I felt the void that had been filled by friends and family. How was I to accept that this time I spent with my friends would be the last? How was I to understand the reason behind being ripped out of my life? 
&gt;
&gt;The next day we were gone. As we were riding the train back to our small, fresh with morning dew, and the roaming cattle dispersed upon a pasture stretching out to the horizon, touching the rising sun.  Amidst the fields of grain were woods teeming with wildlife; the very essence of nature itself. It all slowly began fading into a memory. 
&gt;
&gt;Boarding off the train onto the slatternly, I ran outside. I did not know why I was running, or where.  Sprinting in between a rundown alley created by the adjacent building I crashed into a garbage can, plummeting to the ground. The hard cracked pavement had provided no cushion to soften the fall. Skin slid against the sandpaper like pavement creating an abrasion from elbow to fingertip. The exposed aching flesh needed tending, so defeated, I went home. 
&gt;
&gt;The next two days were spent abed in a small crevice within the cramped apartment. My brother and I watched as pieces of our lives were either packed up or thrown away. With no choice in the matter
&gt;
&gt;On our last day, our friendships, and our home. We were leaving our life to begin again in a faraway country. As the tears ran down the faces of the ones we loved, we said our farewells. At that moment, I realized that it was over. It was time to start anew.

Preservice Teachers Learning” by Margaret Schmidt

(name)

(institution)


     In this article

offered at the undergraduate level and their value to those experiencing them. The purpose of this study is to

explore the value of coursework and field experience in the eyes of multiple undergraduate students and how

these opinions relate to John Dewey's theory of experience. The research in this study focused on three main

research questions: “During their undergraduate program

their teaching experiences in a variety of settings? What aspects of these teaching experiences seemed most

valuable to them? Does Dewey’s theory of experience provide a meaningful framework for interpreting the value

they placed on their teaching experiences?” (Schmidt 2010)

     Six instrumental education majors were researched over two years

courses. Students were observed through video, seminars, and a

personal interview. Upon completion of the gathering of data

based on key topics touched on by each subject. This data was then constructed into a response designed to

reflect the students' opinions in their own point of view. Students were then able to offer suggestions to make

the data as accurate as possible.

     Students reported many ideas from their undergraduate experience that they learned and then assigned

value. Four main experiences proved most valuable to the group of subjects: peer teaching exercises

university-mandated field experience

lessons and being an aid to local groups. (Schmidt

connection to Dewey's theory of experience.

     Dewey's theory accurately represented the opinions of these students and were readily observed under his

central points of continuity

plan writing was exemplary of interaction in Dewey's theory. The students learned about different learning

methods and how interaction can affect how a student learns from classroom experiences. The subjects

demonstrated continuity in learning in the way that they related present experience to those that they already

had

important role in the students' learning by allowing them to safely learn through experimentation and trial and

error methods.

     Although students value further field experience for teacher preparation

classroom community setting to facilitate formation of ideas and supplement growth as an educator. Interaction

with their peers also proved to be valuable to these subjects

subjects showed that coursework is also a highly important aspect of teacher preparation.

     Some aspects of this study raise questions about accuracy and obtaining useful information. The first

problem about the data is that it was mostly collected before the subjects graduated. To truly gauge the

students' opinions about value in their undergraduate experience

interviewed several years down the road to see how applicable each type of experience was. This premature

conclusion of study significantly weakens the information in this article. Another issue with this research is the

fact that the researcher was actively involved with the students from day to day as an instructor. When a study is

being performed

information to your audience. It seems unlikely that an instructor could stay purely impartial in study when

dealing with his students on the very topics he is attempting to gain incite into. The final issue is the fact that all

students in the study are from the same institution. Plurality could strengthen his point about the importance of

coursework if several university programs were a part of the study.

My current background, I have been taught by experts in many different fields, from psychology to molecular biology.  This large variation in subjects allows me to analyze and review research from many different perspectives within science. By experiencing and actively learning about a subject from enthusiastic experts in their related fields, I too was motivated to find an area that I was extremely interested in, which turned out to be behavioural neuroscience.  As I began to specialize into my areas of interest during 4th semester, my grades have improved drastically, which has placed me in standing with the Dean's honours list.  

Through my experience from taking behavioural neuroscience, and background information, that will be used to guide this proposed research, such as the various surgical techniques, and the conditioning of the animals to self-administer heroin.  This area of research, in regards to drug addiction and relapse, is of high interest for me, and may possibly have a large impact on the future of treatment for those dealing with drug addiction.  When I took introduction to psychology, my interest would lie on the effects of various psychoactive drugs on the central nervous system of human and animal models

1321566001.0,mg53a,My autobiographical essay for a college application,FutureBoltcutter,6,1,2,"I'm looking for any kind of assistance on this- I'm an awful writer (terse should have been my middle name). This is the first draft

EDIT: Second draft
&gt;There have been times where I have felt like my life and future were shackled to my health and my mother's drug habits. I would picture these bindings as thick and heavy, and motivated to make up for lost time. This period left its mark on me, and formed the foundation of my desire to go to college: I want to be everything I can be.

&gt;I was always a bookish child, it was Animal Planet or Discovery. I aspired to be a Stephen Irwin or Charles Darwin. I wanted to travel the world, discover new animals, and protect them from the encroaches of humanity on their habitats. When I learned I had to live with pain that could keep me curled in a ball on a good day, those dreams felt dashed. How could I ever spend weeks away from humanity doing research when I was like that?

&gt;There should be a word to describe the feeling of waiting in a doctor's office to learn what is wrong with you. When I was twelve, and was growing larger. This lead to a simple operation to drain it, which should have eliminated the pain. It never stopped, and the cyst grew back within weeks. There were a few more operations after that one, each as ineffective as the last, while becoming increasingly invasive. Eventually, the doctors  decided to leave it be. I was to live with a constant ache.

&gt;Lives are crushed by drug abuse, and completely unresponsive to me. I panicked, and immediately called my aunt who came to get us. Later, when she was sober, she lied about having a bad reaction to a new medication and promised that it would never happen again. In my naivete I believed every word. Nights like that would become increasingly common, nearly a daily occurrence at some points. I stopped calling relatives when it happened, and lied about it when they asked me how she had been.

&gt;These two issues left me feeling like I had no hope or future. I was an invalid most of the time and my mother was a drug-addict who had lost her job- What could I ever amount to? I sank into a deep depression I am still recovering from. I lost most of my friends, I was contemplating suicide. This went on for nearly two years.

&gt;I remember waking up one day feeling sick of being depressed. It was almost like the self-hatred about every aspect of myself had targeted itself. I didn't truly care why I felt that way. Instead, I realized I had lost years of time to nothing. I had fallen severely out of shape and behind on my studies. The next morning, I began an exercise and study regiment, and changed my diet for the better.

&gt;I can see a future for myself now. The pain I live with isn't going to hold me back from being the zoologist I want to be, I want to apply myself to my limits to make up for the time I've lost. I hope that in doing so, I can distinguish myself enough to do the research I have always dreamed of. Dowling's Higher Education Opportunity Program states that its purpose is to “enable students to hurdle the academic and financial barriers facing them.“ I feel that I qualify in both these regards.

_____________________________________

I think undoubtedly the question of life is “What is the meaning of life?” The answers to this question may vary from a scientific standpoint (i.e. “We are all just a beautiful set of mistakes that developed over time”) to a more religious point of view (i.e. “To get to heaven”)

I, me being the idealistic kid that I am ( as my parents would say, “ornery”), I would show up on Sundays with questions like “What is faith?” and “How could Noah have possibly fit 2 of every animal on his boat?”. Needless to say, the elderly folks who taught Sunday school weren’t used to a husky little 3rd grade boy asking them questions that they had struggled to answer their whole lives. I would always get different answers that were really just cop outs because they didn’t know what else to tell a kid my age.

Even though I was questioning religion at every step

It wasn’t until my freshman year in high school that I started to become vocal to my peers about questioning religion. I soon found others who were like me and we would often hold semi-organized debates about religion and the meaning of life. I soon came to the conclusion that there really was no meaning of life and that we were simply here to be here and nothing really mattered. Some would call this depression (I was on Accutane at the time so this is completely feasible)

It soon came time to look into options for my future, car mechanic or an entrepreneur.

I would still classify part of myself as a catholic but only in the way that I treat people and not the way that man has came to be where he is today. I am an 18 year old agnostic that treats people well and is trying his hardest to be the best person that he can be.

1320258887.0,lxyq1,Personal Statement for Law School (First Draft),Wannabe0L,3,0,2,"“That is what I thought and realized when I heard your teachings. That is why I am going on my way—not to seek another doctrine

I am an atheist who went to Catholic school for 8 years. While I am sure that religious schools have churned out many atheists
I first developed my beliefs after reading Siddhartha the summer before I went to high school. In the book, ‘how is it that so many people in the world can have different religions, and yet each still claims it is the right one?’ This makes several assumptions about God and the development of religion in general, but I eventually came to the following conclusion: God is not man’s creator; religion is a universally human trait that, in a long enough timeline, every society will develop.  

My realization had left me alone, I was a fighter. In my religion classes, I would argue vehemently with the teachers and other students. Outside class, people wouldn’t take my arguments seriously; I was just a godless heathen. I began to argue so strongly that others would simply dismiss me, assuming I was merely a contrarian, prone to disagree with whatever they thought. It was during this time that I discovered my passion for discussion. 

In college, these weren’t strangers anymore. The only way for me to discover people’s religious beliefs was to become good enough friends with them that it didn’t matter anymore. I no longer wanted to fight; I was tempered into a semi-rational adult. When I talked about religion, it was no longer with the need to convince them of my beliefs. Instead, it was a true discussion, an attempt to discover more about the other person and grow with them. My argumentative nature in high school was merely my attempt to grow ‘at’ people, instead of with them. It’s this important distinction that would make me a good lawyer. 

I have no problem thinking on my toes in a heated debate; I can argue circles around the best of them. More importantly, both to law school and beyond, and defend those viewpoints. I want to be an integral member of society, one that holds up the infrastructure that has been established and allows people to come together and truly discuss.

Monster
	Josephine was asleep in her bed.  It was three in the morning when the first noise came; a thud as the front door was thrown open into the wall.  She imagined the already plastered dent deepening and didn’t move.  She knew if she did it would only make the night worse for her.
	She heard fast words traded between a man and a woman.  The hushed tones reminded her of wind whipping around before a storm.  The storm was brewing downstairs and any minute it would break.  She heard one word shouted above the others.
	“Drunk!”
	The sound of her mother’s body falling followed.  The poor woman always ended up in the same situation after provoking the Monster.  Josephine started to cry controlled
	The stairs creaked and Josephine’s body stiffened under the covers.  The Monster was coming and there was no way out.  She was trapped in the dark with the monster chasing her and he knew all of her favorite hiding spots.  Josephine looked asleep, unlike the foolish girl lying in her bed.
	The door creaked open
	This was his favorite part of the night, but he inhaled it and used it as fuel.  
	She imagined him standing in the doorway with a grin creeping over his hideous, darkening his face.  He was a shadow straight from her nightmares, thumbing through her fears patiently as if looking through a restaurant menu.  Each time he chose a different fear as a way to approach the young girl.  
	
Josephine remembered one of her first nights in the house with its Monster.  In the beginning the Monster had seemed so kind
	“Foster families are scary sometimes
Josephine had never known her real mother.  The landlord found her after knocking the door down to their apartment.  Her mother lay dead and bloody on the bathroom floor with the bath water running
Immediately after
One day
	“Don’t worry
	After so much misfortune
	Josephine stood in the rain with the Monster as he gathered her bags and started to carry them to the house.  The cold drops splashed onto her cheeks and matted her bangs to her forehead.  She clutched her arms to keep warm and followed him into the house.

	The Monster had chosen a way to approach her and the floorboards creaked under his heavy boots.  It became harder for Josephine to contain her shaking

	She had met her timid new mother who made the girl a bowl of chicken noodle soup after getting in from the rain
	The Monster came down the stairs. 
	“I put your bags in your room
	Josephine nodded
	“It’s so large
	The Monster grinned down at her, Jo Jo.  Is it okay if I call you Jo Jo?” he chuckled and ran a large hand across cropped, dark hair.  “Me and the misses get pretty lonely sometimes.  I think you’re going to make our lives a lot more fun!”
	She smiled back at him
	That night and the next few nights went well for her.  Josephine was starting to really enjoy the new house and her new family.  She easily accepted her new mother, he was always asking her questions and trying to find ways to bring her retired voice back to life.  He never tried to talk to the mother, though, who watched his attempts through aged eyes.
	The first night Josephine was introduced to the real Monster started off as any other.  She was sleeping
	“You’re drunk again!  How can you do this?  We have Josephine now; you can’t just go out drinking every night!  God, her voice cracking with the strain of begging for the same miracle more than once.
	“You leave me alone
	She could hear the fright in her mother’s next statement.  “I know Richard; I just think you shouldn’t drink as much as you do.  It worries me.  I’m worried Richard.”
	“Don’t worry
	Her mother said something inaudible, and her heart skipped a beat.
	“DON’T GIVE ME THAT ATTITUDE MARYANN!  HOW MANY TIMES DO I NEED TO TELL YOU?” he roared from downstairs.
	The sound of another strike echoed in her eardrums followed by muffled sobs, she sat frozen to the top step, shaking while tears streaked down her cheeks.  The Monster came into view and stopped at the bottom step staring up at Josephine.  He was encased in darkness again, a shadow to her.  He wobbled in his drunken stupor and then gripped the railing, making his way upstairs.
	Now Josephine’s legs were ready to listen, still empty room, curled into a ball and trying to disappear into the darkness.  The Monster’s footsteps echoed in the empty hall and stopped outside of her door.  The door creaked as he opened it slowly, and she cried harder when she saw his enormous form taking up the entire doorframe.  
	“What’s wrong
	The next morning her mother came to her room to wake her for breakfast.  They sat together quietly in the room as she showed Josephine how to hide the bruises with make-up

	The bones in his knees cracked as he bent to crouch in front of her supposed sleeping figure.  His breath was hot and damp against her cool cheeks
	She heard the smile in his voice.  “What are you doing up so late

	After her one mistake of getting caught, curled up in a corner somewhere shaking and sobbing.  Sometimes luck would be on the girl’s side and he would be too drunk to remember his final stop.  On the nights she did escape him however, the Monster always caught her in dreams.  He lurked in the shadows, but she always knew he was there because of the strong smell of whiskey and the slow, heavy footsteps that filled her heart with dread and echoed in her mind.
	Josephine was never able to bring herself run away; she couldn’t even make herself leave the sanctity of her bedroom.  When the case workers came to check up on Josephine, awaiting the wrath of the Monster.

Something felt different about this night to Josephine
	She already knew the Monster had caught her; faltering even slightly was enough for him to know.  Josephine was quivering with anticipation; the flame of hope burned inside her for the first time in her life.  She let her brave eyes flutter open and stared straight into the Monster’s distorted face.
	A frightening smile crawled across his shadowed face
	“Jo Jo, Jo Jo.  We’re so happy to-”
	Josephine didn’t want to hear anymore of his lies, stunned for a moment.
	Josephine leapt up and crossed the room in a flash of hope, her flame had gone out completely and sad realization dawned on the girl.  The locked door laughed at her misfortune.  
It only made sense that a Monster like this would lock the door.  Even though Josephine never ran, and in knowing his power, decided not to take precautions.  Josephine’s assumption tore at her body as she regretted even thinking escape was possible.  
‘You should’ve known!’ her brain shrieked at her. ‘How could you be so stupid?’
The Monster roared livid with anger and tore the blanket off, the Monster caught up and slammed it closed again.
He turned on the girl and locked the door behind him, and she wanted to look away but her eyes knew better.  The worst part was that she angered the Monster in the process of failing.
“I was trying to speak with you
Josephine tensed her body, the stench of whiskey suffocating her.  ",,False,,t5_2s6rw,False,,

This was a reason why I was very reluctant to take work there but hell there is no other place that a black man can work these days, in the great war of 2020 Jerusalem was lost under hundreds of tonnes worth of stone after the Israelis decided to destroy a Muslim refugee settlement located 60 miles away. The force of the new bomb, which was christened the Apple of Eden because of the way it tempts a man, caused all the stone in the ground to move and consequently the way to make the bomb and Jerusalem sunk under hundreds of kilometres worth of Earth. I think that Kane is sending us to Jerusalem because he wants a way to threaten the last free colonies on the Earth and the orbit cities with the richest of people who love freedom on them. I am part of a Spec ops military team known as triple runners. We are a team of nine people that have all served in the worst of wars over the past 10 years, I guess me and Raphael were chosen because we both served in the North Korean invasion of 2022 and the Russian hammer invasion of 2026.
As we land on the ground that used to be Jerusalem we realise that something is wrong
As I arise I am surround by the palest of faces, his English surprisingly good. “Are you in any pain right now?” he asked me still dazed from the drugs I could not reply “good that means the drugs are working, my name is Gregory I was once a volunteer doctor before this happened to the city.” He paused for a second, “you may be wondering how this is all possible well it is going to take some explaining.” We talked for a long time but eventually I understood that the caves that had existed under Jerusalem took Jerusalem into them and the city broke off into about 3 parts this was 3 parts made up of 45% of the city however and all parts existed deeper than where I was. I was then told that we were attacked by Terrorists made up of the American forces who wished to draw the people of Jerusalem out or alternatively scare them enough so they couldn’t come up for food and would starve so then the Americans could go in and pillage what was left of Jerusalem. It was then that I was told perhaps the worst news so far, all my team had been killed in the attack so it was just me, by this time I had been off the drugs long enough that I had my bearings and so I got the people to take me to the top so that I could kill all of the terrorists who slaughtered my team, The people assisted me because they were spurred by my courage and we managed to defeat the surrounding troops. I am unsure of what will happen now but I know that Kane knows that Jerusalem is rising against him; The war on terror has only just begun...

In the article “College Girl to Call Girl” the author, but rather as high-end call girls because they work from houses or expensive hotels, which are purchased by the professional rich men. Due to the increasing tuition fees in Canada and the low minimum wages in most provinces, students are leaving University with an average of $25,000 worth of debt, which evidently has led to an incline in off-street prostitution, which makes up 80% of Canada’s prostitution industry. Some students have gotten into the business because of the good pay, although some of the students come from a troubled background, with the increasing tuition prices

A Summary of Crystal Balls
In the essay “Crystal Balls” the author, Kim makes it clear that, that is not what she wants. Kim does not deny the progress that women have made over the years for their independence such as, earning pay almost equal to that of a man and the freedom of choice that women have been given for their career choices. However, Kim argues that women and man should be equals rather than having one gender on top. She sees the future of women much more broad rather than a focus on women first. Kim is influenced by her friend’s view of the world that gender attributes are not as important anymore as are individual attributes. She states that newer generations are forgetting about gender biases and focusing more on what people can do as individuals. Kim’s friend does not deny that men still hold most of the power, although Kim hopes that the shift for women is a shift for gender equality, not dominance by a specific gender.

It's hard to list all the ways you've been a blessing in my life. Of course I am grateful for your amazing generosity. I'm also grateful for you as a person... It's been a pleasure and an honor getting to know you.

Before I met you, mysterious authority figure."" But the real culprit was Derp's, shall we say... one-dimensional portrayal of you. Derpina likes to reminisce about you and me quoting ""Jabberwocky"" over burgers at TJ's, but for me the defining experience was when you took Derp and me for a night tour around Minneapolis. As you chauffered us around town amiably, you told us the story of that famous poster where the hippie girl is putting a flower in the soldier's gun... about how you were there that day, and about what it meant to you. I was blown away. I realized that, not only did you have more than one dimension, entertaining

I've continued to be pleasantly surprised as I get to know you better. I enjoy your cheerful, and to have half as many great stories of a life well lived.

Thanks for being a friend, and just a really cool guy. Here's to many more movie nights and snooty academic discussions of Impressionist paintings.

Happy Birthday!

	I am writing this letter to petition the suspension of my financial aid because of my failure to meet the constituents of the Satisfactory Academic Progress Policy in the summer quarter of the 2010 school year.  The deficiency of my credit progress was due to personal reasons that I will explain in this letter. Since the time of the suspension award
	During the winter quarter of 2010 I was attending WWU and completing the last of the GURs for my intended major. During this quarter my girlfriend became pregnant with our child. The implications of this required that I refocus my attention away from school and into the obligations I was experiencing with my girlfriend. On April 9th 2010
 On April 16th 2010 I enrolled in an independent learning course that I paid for with my own private funds. This class was the final stipulation that needed to be completed before I could apply for admission into my degree program. My intention was to complete this course at the flexibility of my personal commitment to my girlfriend and our child and someday, my girlfriend experienced a miscarriage and lost the expected child. The time that followed the miscarriage was extremely exhausting both emotional and physically and placed tremendous stresses on both my personal relationships and my own private life. It was this summer quarter of 2010 that my financial aid was suspended due my failure to complete the correspondence course in the allotted time frame that I had enrolled in.
	I enrolled in classes on the main campus of WWU for fall quarter 2010, I cannot continue to finance my education with out additional assistance. I will not receive any financial contributions from my family and cannot afford to attend WWU with out the subsidies of financial aid and additional private loans.  My commitment to graduating from WWU with a Bachelors of Arts in Urban Planning from Huxley is now again the most pertinent area of my focus. My ability to achieve this degree has resounding significance in regards to the future I intend to create for future family and myself. But with out reinstatement of my ability to receive financial aid while attending WWU, I surely cannot achieve the goal of graduating with my desired degree.
	I appreciate all your time and effort in allowing me the opportunity to explain my situation. I hope that this letter illustrates the unfortunate circumstances that led to my inadequate progress while attending WWU and all the while illustrating my passion to continue attending WWU. Again

I am proud of my work history and know that it will allow me achieve my goals.

If so, how?)",chuelita,2, my muscles strain, and my sweat trickles. My feet walk over to the next set of weights
	Surprisingly, the greater the reward will be. So, not only has lifting weights become routine, but also anaerobic exercises. The weightlifting will help develop my muscles, while the cardio will help me lose every ounce of fat I have gained from the past. Every drop of sweat felt dripping down my back is another ounce of fat leaving my slowly developing body. 
Memories of my past physique both haunt and motivate me to amendment myself; to evolve into a better person. Every time an extremely difficult portion of a workout is reached, every weight lifted, and every workout completed. The preparation and the journey itself have not been easy. To motivate oneself to take action is one thing; however; truly taking action is a different story. Even after spending a substantial amount of time motivating myself to get fit, not enough willpower was found to actually get out of my chair and start working out. The realization that a failure was imminent dawned upon me, and I became aware that by not partaking in fulfilling my current goals, I was building an unstable foundation for my future goals. In order to prevent this failure, I needed to change my approach towards working out.  I forced my mind to view working out as a hobby, a way to relieve stress. Whenever a feeling of anger or discontent ever came into my mind from any unrelated topic, which slowly melted off body fat. More weight training was later added to the mix, appetite
By becoming my own personal trainer and motivator, I also began doing so in other aspects. My productivity and effectiveness increased drastically over time, and in a wide range of areas. Whenever a household chore needed to be done, it would immediately be taken care of. Whenever a homework assignment was given out, it was completed on the same day it was given. With the extra energy boost that lifting weights supplied me, my productivity exponentially grew. My lifestyle was again evolved, and I found myself in complete control of every task thrown at me. 
The agony has ended. The weights are placed back on the rack, shirtless, I scrutinize my new build. A smile spreads across my face; satisfaction is finally reached. My phone vibrates, and the screen displays a text message: Refrigerator’s empty. Pick up groceries for this week. Without a second thought, my feet bring me to the gym’s entrance and I proceed with my next task.

I understand that you have reached a definitive ""No"" regarding my appeal for english next year

First, you have my word that my drive to succeed has increased significantly since sophomore year. My efforts grew throughout the year, hence my improvement in Dr. (my professor last year)'s class. Because of this, I feel as if next year I will have more success as a result of my desire to increase my efforts.

Lastly, I can move down to English 11? It is my understanding that this a common occurrence in the math department (i.e. honors math--&gt;accelerated math).

If, could you at least share the materials I'd need to study in order to succeed on the exam this May? I'd like to get a start on them this summer.

Frank


At long last, plowed the country into the ground precisely because of the fabulous rewards that were showered on them.  Massive inequality, we have learned, isn't the best way to run an economy after all. And when you think about it, it's also profoundly ugly.

Some people haven't received the memo, which tells how she went about hiring another woman to bear her child.

For years Ms. Kuczynski worked the plutocracy beat for the New York Times, and the feeling on the hard streets of Greenwich and the Hamptons.

Somewhere along the way, the meat, the guests, the yoga instructor, the chefs, and the logs that were required to restore the property's log cabins to her husband's exacting standards.

Now Ms. Kuczynski's trademark concern for the moneyed becomes memoir as she relates to us, which is genuinely piteous, but quickly goes wrong, as she and her husband decide to hire a woman to carry their child and review applications from women with available wombs.

Surrogate motherhood has been the subject of much philosophical and political dispute over the years. To summarize briefly, surrogacy comes close to organ-selling, or even baby-selling. It threatens to commodify not only babies, but women as well, putting their biological functions up for sale like so many Jimmy Choos. If surrogacy ever becomes a widely practiced market transaction, it will probably make pregnancy into just another dirty task for the working class, with wages driven down and wealthy couples hiring the work out because it's such a hassle to be pregnant.

Ms. Kuczynski is not entirely oblivious to these issues; indeed

It's ""organ rental, the biological baby sitter, for my baby."" And, yes, the surrogate applicants could all use the money, if not desperately; the one who gets the job plans to use it to help pay her kids' way through college. Additionally, one of the surrogate's children, ""had been an egg donor to help pay her college tuition.""

Maybe if this young woman had been donating her eggs to buy groceries Ms. Kuczynski would have understood that all this reproduction-for-hire was a product of her billionaire-centric world as surely as the Blahniks and Versace she used to trill about--that college and surrogacy are available to people like Ms. Kuczynski and not to others because that's how our system works.

Instead she tells us, drinking bourbon and going to the Super Bowl."" She also does a lot of ""Bikram yoga,"" which is presumably a really quality form of yoga.

What she doesn't tell us is even more revealing. Of the story's nearly 8, really, tell us her thoughts about much of anything. About Ms. Kuczynski's own feelings and fears and cravings we get paragraph after maudlin paragraph. The one who does the labor is almost completely silent.

Then there are the photographs, with columns, topiary and servant. The surrogate sitting, barefoot and alone, on a beat-up porch of her house in Pennsylvania.

As intelligent beings, and what our place in it may be.Yet, in the end we are essentially left with only more questions and uncertainty. As if we were living in a maze with no end, we never truly understand who we are. In the end left with nothing more then the certainty of death; we are surround by lost dreams, and never answered questions of what could have been, as we are often unable to live our lives to the fullest. Left with what only seem to be a haze of the memories that once were.

A few years ago my life as I knew it became flipped upside down leaving me sitting lost and confused surrounded by endless unanswered questions towards myself and my life. I was like a helpless child on his first day at a new school. I didn’t know what to do or where to go; the never ending spiral of confusion within the depths of my consciousness never seemed to end. For, and I had found myself completely helpless. That was until I found the art of yoga. 

Being an exercise enthusiast most my life I often contemplated beginning my journey into the practice of yoga, and began what would soon become a life long journey. My first day inside the yoga studio I felt as if I had walked through a different dimension, I questioned if I had still been on earth, for it just couldn’t have been the case. For never before had I been given the opportunity to meet a group of individuals whom truly had no judgment, criticism, or hate for those around them. They were filled with nothing more than compassion, love, not only for themselves

Still to this day I remember the joy on my instructor face as she hugged me at the end of my first class. For I will never forget the peace and serenity I felt, not the ability to control what there outcome will bring me. 

Through my journey, or the amount of wealth we posses. We are not are emotions or the way we feel on a day to day basis. I slowly discovered that we aren’t the things I always felt defined us as individuals and human beings. I saw that by stripping away our fears, worries, desires, failures, and all the things that miss defined us as individuals, we can learn to be contempt with who we are and what we will become. I learned that through the art of yoga and meditation I could slowly develop a deeper awareness of my physiological and psychological states; gradually beginning to purify my mind, and spirit. Though

1369301987.0,1ew7yt,Short Catcher in the Rye essay,sams1623,2,0,1,"The prompt is to compare Holden Caulfield to a Biblical character

Our teacher says not to have an introductory paragraph

Here's the essay:

Holden proactively searches for adulthood, never put in any effort and this has caused him to move from school to school with no success. This lack of will to work toward the future truly hurts Holden. In addition to hurting himself through lack of effort,  Holden’s search for adulthood also proves to hurt Holden in emotional ways. One way Holden searches for adulthood is through sex. For example, Holden asks a schoolmate, Stradlater, if he had sex with an old friend of his. Stradlater replies diplomatically, saying “That’s a professional secret, and they get in a fight. There are two reasons why Holden does this. The first is because he’s jealous that Stradlater had sex with this old friend of his, implying Holden isn’t an adult. This sort of condescending language makes Holden furious, he suggests that they run away together. Sally disregards this completely

Similar to the Demoniac, by sitting in a cave and cutting himself endlessly due to the demons that possess him. Holden can relate: the demon that possesses him is actually his immaturity. Holden, throughout the book, finds that his immaturity holds him back from academic success, achieving normal interaction, and living a happy life. However, as the book ends, in which the sadness she triggers within Holden actually inspires him to change. In this case, “the guy I like best in the Bible, just as the Demoniac does

In contrast, by the end of the novel. In Holden’s case, he has simply come to a harsh realization of himself and the immature choice’s he’s made, which shoots him in the direction toward adulthood. Obviously, this one moment can’t immediately transform him into an adult, but it gets the ball rolling.

1368992011.0,1enahi,Can someone proofread what I have so far? Due on Tuesday 5/21,Mattnotmattress,3,1,0,"(It's an Atheist Existentialism using the book Native Son by Richard Wright as a basis)

In the novel Native Son, Bigger’s actions can be connected to a philosophy known as existentialism, which in turn is separated into the two categories: Atheist and Christian existentialism by Jean-Paul Sartre in his expositional speech “Existentialism is a Humanism”. Essentially, as Bigger goes through the motions of his actions, his choices become reflected by either the Christian or Atheist side of existentialism in which he is either dictated by a higher power or acting on his free will. Though the book provides evidence of both forms of existentialism, Wright’s story is a more extensive example of Atheist existentialism. In Native Son, Wright’s story is an example of Atheist Existentialism and conveys the basic understandings of the three facets: anguish, and despair throughout the book. Jean-Paul Sartre, Wright utilizes the tone and facets of atheist existentialism in Native Son to provoke thought towards one's understanding of ""existence before essence"".

Native Son exemplifies Sartre’s description of atheist existentialism in which he believes that “existence comes before essence”. In Sartre’s lecture, and that people’s choices in life have their own consequences, which in turn gives way to the three types of Atheist existentialism: Abandonment, Anguish, and Despair. However Sartre makes it clear that he supports Atheist existentialism but establishes the dominance of Christian existentialism in society. Christian existentialism is the idea that counters Atheist existentialism in the sense of “essence before existence”, that before someone is born, their life is planned out with a pre-determined destiny and that they have no control over their actions. However, the blame for the action can be placed on god since they were the “mighty being” that created them in the first place, surges up in the world and defines himself afterwards” (Sartre). In his lecture, Bigger’s actions play a central part in demonstrating Atheist existentialism throughout the story as his actions ultimately define his character and growth throughout the novel. In Book Two

However, relates to the facet Anguish, in which Native Son promotes the idea of Anguish to make the readers understand the impact that their actions have on their surroundings. Sartre believes that man is in constant anguish because people’s actions constantly have an effect on others. Sartre believes that when mankind acts they not only act for themselves, but they are “at the same time a legislator deciding for the whole of mankind” (Sartre). Sartre commends upon man’s power to act but however maintains his belief that man’s actions dictate resulting consequences and responsibilities to others. Further more, by Sartre depicting man as a “legislator” and explicitly stating that man decides for the entirety of mankind, he wants to prove the extensive effects that one’s actions have on the world, maintaining the state of Anguish that the world is in. Native Son provides examples of Anguish that correlates to Bigger’s transition between his black-and-white world, before Bigger takes the job at the Daltons, Bigger slowly begins to feel the repercussions of the crime and begins to understand the calamity of his actions. Bigger now believed that “his murder of her was more…justified by the fear and shame she had made him feel…it seemed that her actions had evoked fear and shame in him” (127).  The author’s use of “evoked” connotes the provocation of change that Bigger’s actions have brought to his situation and himself. Here

Out of all of Bigger’s capabilities and actions, which is the next facet. Wright describes Bigger’s actions and intentions in a way that provokes the thought of Sartre’s definition of Despair. Sartre believes Despair to be present within modern society and especially within the limitations/expectations of the average class. Sartre intends to show that humanity “limits [themselves] to a reliance upon [which]… the probabilities render our actions feasible” (Sartre). Sartre’s ideology explains that individuals plan out certain goals to accomplish, but he/she will tend to end up settling for the bare minimum rather than taking the initiative to fully achieve that goal. The word choice of “limit” and “feasible” further connects humanity’s need for gratification to the appeasement that they receive from coming somewhat close to his/her goal, keeping humanity in a period of despair that limits individuals from innovating themselves further. Wright’s depiction of Bigger’s actions continually puts him a situation of Despair in which he wants to change his life for the better, but is unable to do so because he wants to take the easy way out of his predicaments. During Book One, after Bigger commits the murder, he becomes wrapped up in the intensity and taboo of his actions. He realizes that he can act beyond the boundaries of society, he feels the bravado and power of a man that is beyond his own environment, Wright ascertains that because Bigger has committed such a huge taboo

Wright’s novel can be analyzed as a more extensive example of Atheist existentialism rather than the Christian side; and to further justify the Atheist side; Wright’s characters provide examples of the last facet, living life in abandonment.

The thesis of sociological functionalism is that recurrent social processes or events serve a function that is necessary to the maintenance of a social system. According to this thesis, if it is, (2) the function of that process that is necessary to the maintenance of a social system. 

Several sociological functionalists identify deviance as a social process that is both recurrent and functions in a way that is necessary to the maintenance of a social system. They typically offer two types of arguments to support the claim that deviance is recurrent. The first depends on documented cases of deviant behavior; the sociological functionalist claims that there are enough of these cases to establish deviance as a recurrent social process. The second depends on the concept of society itself. Society is said to be (necessarily) constituted of different people with different ideas of what is good or right, when some people do things that they think are good or right, their actions will be deviant to others. To support the claim that deviance is necessary to the maintenance of social systems, sociological functionalists identify different functions of deviance and attempt to show that that function is necessary to the maintenance of a social system. I’ll leave it up to you (the student) to think of some functions of deviance that might....

Many children eat too many sweets and high-fat foods. There are plenty of people we could blame this on

First off, they think that is good enough. But a well-rounded diet is important for their growth and their health so parents must be more assertive about their children’s diet.

But there are also parents that will do the opposite, they will rebel and do the opposite. So parents must be creative in order to help their children try new foods that are better for them. A good example is to add peanut butter and raisins to celery, so they think it is more of a treat or a game and encourages them to get used to the taste of celery. If eating healthier is turned into a game for children, parents will not have to be so aggressive about eating habits and the children will feel like they are choosing it on their own.

Additionally

A similar fault is that parents are not present to enforce healthy eating routines for their children. If a child gets home before their parents, so that children will make the correct diet choices without requiring a parent to be there.

Above all, rice and pasta. These foods are very low in essential nutrients but greatly increases the amount of insulin in the blood which turns into body fat. The recommended serving size for the base of the pyramid should be greatly reduced and replaced with fruits and vegetables.

The food pyramid states that the recommended serving size of fruits and vegetables is about 2-5 servings per day. Most nutritionists believe this number is still too low

With this in mind, and antioxidants that are not found in most meat products. Many nutritionists suggest to replace high-fat meats with leaner options, fish, and/or beans. This will lower obesity rates while increasing the amount of essential nutrients consumed. Many children face problems of obesity and other diseases that could be treated just by altering their diet.

Obesity rates have more than doubled in children and tripled in adolescents in the past 30 years. Childhood obesity has led to around 1 in every 400 children being diagnosed with diabetes. Children with diabetes are at risk of having a heart attack at the young age of 30. This problem could be alleviated if parents would enforce a better diet to their children. Therefore, weight, and activity level all play a big part in determining what the recommended serving sizes should be. So parents must do more research and decide which diet is best for their family.

Teaching evolution in public schools

     Evolution is a controversial topic that’s being thrown around a lot recently. The main way that it’s being tossed around is whether or not it should be taught in school. I'm here to tell you that of course evolution should be taught in school. In all honesty


    My first reason for why this should be taught in public schools is because of the main reason why people are against it; that reason being that it is insensitive to people of other beliefs. Well, we have to cater the entire system to what they think? Someone is always going too offended by everything that's ever said, ever. If you put this in another situation it’s going to look rather silly. Say that you're at a restaurant, and you order a dish that's gotten high praise in all its reviews from the best critics in the world. You order this very highly esteemed dish and you happen to not like it. In fact, you're so disgusted by this that you go to the chef and demand that the dish be taken off of the menu. Now, this seems like a rather irrational thing to do when you put it in a different light. There is quite an easy solution to putting evolution in public schools, and still having it is fair to people of other beliefs. That one way being simply teach creationism in public schools as well. You can allow the kids to make decisions for themselves rather than having them making ill informed decisions based on no premises. In all honesty, taking this course of action would lead me to my next point


    Humans are naturally curious creatures; just by knowing that, to know— has found expression in every culture.”(Curiosity) The biggest one that I’d want to know about is my origin, or where I came from. That’s where we came about with all of these theories like religion, and evolution to simply explain how we came about and why we’re here. Now, tell me this, why would you want to take a class out of schools, that caters very well to answering that very question? Not just that


    Evolution isn't just a theory anymore. The main problem that people have with evolution is that they don't think there's enough proof backing it up, there is also overwhelming evidence that supports the theory of evolution. Everything from fossil records to biogeography the evidence is simply staggering. (MS cerqueira)   Ever since the days of Charles Darwin, scientists have been researching fossil and dating of layers of rock all leading up to today, where were fighting the battle of having evolution taught in public schools. 


    After all that has been said about evolution, and just the common sense required to say, yes animals would change to suit the needs of their environment, there is no reason not to agree with evolution.

	I set out to find if the good overall performance of Britain changed the way the D.C.M.S. handles the formation of future athletes and the distribution of its budget. While having a discussion with a tutor from the Telford College Sports Academy I found out about a government funded program meant to find and help potential elite athletes in achieving athletic performance. The programme is an Advanced Apprenticeship in Sporting Excellence (A.A.S.E. pronounced “Ace”) and through it

In the history of British basketball the national team had only two participations at Olympic Games 1948 and 2012

Telford College’s basketball AASE program allowed me examine the point of view of students that take part in it. Jonnas Dietrich

At 6 foot 3 inches he is not a tall player, that’s if we exclude the fact that he is in full time education, studying A Levels in Biology, Maths and Father Maths at Wolgarston High School (Penkridge) and a BTEC in Sport at TCAT College in which case Sundays are the only days he gets to pursue his hobbies.           

Being in his second year of college, whilst assisting to the training I got the opportunity to talk to the rest of the players and I came to the conclusion that most of these players are prepared to sacrifice their free time in for a chance at a career in basketball.          

But what does a career in British Basketball mean for a young player that aspires to success? First of all

There is a long way to go until Britain’s basketball team will be able to compete at the same level as other nations but by investing in youth programs as the A.A.S.E. As long as the funding will persist,False,,t5_2s6rw,False,,,t3_1ccszr

“Jack, obviously frustrated. With a look of defeat on his face, Jack hoisted his weary body off the mat and jogged near me to attempt another somersault.  For weeks now, I had been working with Jack to perform a simple front roll, but his lack of ability only left me resentful towards the boy.  I did not care that he was eight, or overweight, or Autistic; all I saw was an unfit kid who was making me look bad in front of my new boss.  

Once again, he came close to me and uttered, “I can’t do this, Instructor.” 

The look on his face suggested something more than a mere lack of ability. This pattern of failure was frequent in Jack’s life, Jack’s inability to match his teammates physically made him an outcast. In his mind, this was simply further proof that he was an inadequate person. 

Despite my previous dismay for Jack

“If you can do that, “you can do anything”. 

I quickly saw something click in his head.  His demeanor turned from sorrow to conviction

In one motion, and rolled straight to his feet. Astonished and speechless, my eyes widened and jaw dropped as Jack turned to me with the most radiant smile on his face. He looked at me with eager eyes and said, “Was that right Instructor?”

It seems as if my interest in history, particularly within the United States, didn’t reach a climb until my experience on the debate team. I found myself getting lost reading accounts of several historic events, my favorite being the accounts of Japanese-American internment, I have submerged myself within the art of diplomacy, I had not yet discovered my interest in the past, as it is with any course
	There are courses in which I put in effort solely for the sake of academic success. History is not one of those courses. History is the type of course where I keep up with the reading, but to nurture my desire to learn something I am truly interested in. Sure, my grades may not be consistently stellar, but my desire to learn is consistent. This desire is why I think I can be successful, because it drives me to put in the necessary effort and it drives me to meet the course’s expectations and demands.

Heres how i tackled my introduction: 


Initially, especially in the difficult conflict ridden area. There was an emphasis laid out by the United Nations (U.N) and its advisor to Afghanistan: Lakhdar Brahmi, about the importance of having a light international footprint in the country, to work on creating policies that were more ‘local’, to focus on state building, and to increase the power of the government. These policy making strategies were later abandoned as a result of the gross underestimation of the problems that existed, and the unwillingness of the U.S who spearheaded the entire foreign occupation, and how that approach in policy making later transformed as a result of the several factors discussed above. The failure of the foreign occupancy in Afghanistan can be attributed to the abandonment of the framework developed by Lakhdar Brahmi

As new technologies arise and new inventions are implemented, we can choose much higher quality cuts at an affordable value, and we can even choose our meat based on its origin. But while we bask in the glory of our new meat filled diet, we fail to see the consequences of our actions. Most recently, the blame of America’s health problems has been put sugar filled treats or high fructose corn syrup and while those are contributing factors, there is another that lurks in the dark. There is another cause that does not want to be addressed because America does not want to eat less meat. The meat we are consuming is plagued with pathogens our body cannot fight and the cause of this can be directly linked to the cows we get our meat from. 

The price of corn is described best as a catch-22 of disastrous proportions. Because of the constant lowering of the price, Pepsi Cola, Cargill, and many others to use this excess of corn to create a cheaper good. From an economic standpoint, these companies have created a pathway for innovation. They manipulate the cheapest ingredients available and create a highly demanded item. But from a dietary view, these companies are the worst thing to happen to mankind in some time. 

The most important of these economical geniuses is Cargill. This company has created a very inexpensive grain based feed for cattle that is used nationwide. Many industrialized cattle ranches use this cheap product in order to increase their profit. Once again, the most logical decision. But the question of the ethicality is raised over this cheap feed. Since the manipulation of corn to fit the diet of cattle has been implemented, there has been a drastic increase of health issues in America. For some time this connection was not made simply because nobody ever thought to look at our cows for the source of our undoing.
	
	A cow’s digestive equipment consists of four compartments within a stomach. One in particular, the stomach is where the problem for America lies because cows are unable to digest grains properly. Due to the fact that companies like Cargill have created a feed based on grain, there have been complications within the cow. Complications that have been associated with the health issues of America. When cattle consume grain, their stomachs are prone to creating a more acidic environment for the food to digest. During this process, nature allows E. coli to evolve rapidly enough to survive in this highly acidic stomach. As this newly made bacteria travels through the digestive system unharmed, it is expelled into the feces of the cow. In a slaughterhouse these feces can easily contaminate the meat of the cow. Under normal circumstances, the consumer can properly cook the meat and kill the bacteria. But for the person who enjoys their steak undercooked, it can survive within the stomach of a human and cause serious health problems.


	The excrement of cattle poses another serious risk to Americans in an unexpected way. When the cattle defecate at the ranch where they spend their lives, the ranchers give cattle multiple antibiotics. The unabsorbed antibiotics in the cattle are expelled within the cow’s waste. These antibiotics are then decomposed with the feces into the land and through natural runoff, the

	One of the main arguments against animal testing is that it is morally wrong, poisoned, isolated, starved, forcibly restrained, addicted to drugs, and brain damaged (Peta n.p). The scientists behind animal testing are not purposely hurting the animals for no reason, we should do so. Animals are harmed in the wild every day, but for a good purpose? Next, 95 percent of animals used in experiments are not subject to the laws that help make sure the animals cannot be harmed
	Some might argue that animal experimentation is unnecessary, the human body is very complex; this is why animals aren’t good models to represent humans (Marston 34). Scientists have proven that chimpanzees are the closest related animal to humans, so if we were to test on any animal, it should be chimpanzees. Animal testing is the best solution to find cures for human diseases, and if there was any better way, we would not be animal testing. But that is not the case, so animal experimentation is the most efficient way. Second, doesn’t mean it was not worth it. The scientists doing the experiment still get really helpful information from every experiment they do, and do not contribute to meaningful medical advances (Peta n.p).

In The Coldest Winter Ever, take this.” He handed me the pager. “You gonna see how serious a nigga is. Learn how to respect a man when he talks. I’ll page you when I finish setting up. Seeing is believing. You’ll see. My code is 000.” He hugged me again. “You gonna be mines.” Without Bullet giving Winter a pager, the business intentions of Bullet would have been non-existent. Towards the end of the book, Bullet uses the pager as a way to communicate with his network of Winter and is able to execute business operations that involves the profit of money. The ghetto neighborhood is diverse in business opportunities; communication plays an important role for businesses to flourish. Hierchy is the last element that surrounds the ghetto neighborhood, a business in the ghetto neighborhood must have a hierchy.

The Coldest Winter Ever provides an insight as to what a hierchy in a business is like; there are chapters that provide exemplified descriptions of hierchy. The ghetto neighborhood is a very hostile environment and when a business is founded in a well strung hierchy; the elements of money, power is the amount of influence a business has in the ghetto neighborhood.
In the case of Santiaga, networks of friends and family will be respectful or fearful in a business, loyalty provides a foundation for hierchy.

### Poem here
&gt; Sharon Olds ""rites of passage""

&gt;As the guests arrive at my son's party 
they gather in the living room-- 
short men
with smooth jaws and chins. 
Hands in pockets
jostling
breaking out and calming. One says to another 
How old are you? Six. I'm seven. So? 
They eye each other
tiny in the other's pupils. They clear their 
throats a lot
they fold their arms and frown. I could beat you
up
the dark cake
turret
freckles like specks of nutmeg on his cheeks
chest narrow as the balsa keel of a 
model boat
cool and thin as the day they guided him 
out of me
for the sake of the group. 
We could easily kill a two-year-old
he says in his clear voice. The other 
men agree
like Generals
playing war

Well

 I know you don’t know me, you’ve created a situation that will have dire consequences for either you, or me. Either way, I’m going to break a few things down for you:

1.	[] is my fiancé. He’s not a guy I’m dating, to spend the rest of my life with him. Most people would realize that indicates he wants to be with me, because, DUH.
2.	I am pregnant with []’s child. I don’t sleep around, I’d also hope that if someone chose to have multiple sexual partners, they’d at least try to be safe and clean about it, if not at least honest.
3.	Regardless of whatever proclivities you have regarding digitally distributing your inner labia (that *would* be solely your business had you sent your twat to someone who wanted it, I would hope you’re smart enough to realize if you send a picture of yourself in the midst of passionate, gynecological exploratory adventures (I’m sure it was for science class, right?), that I’ve seen it along with the rest of the proof you have a vagina, and I’m probably not the only one other than [] who has.
4.	[] is not with you. [] is not going to be with you. In any capacity. [] is not going to someday decide to stick his dick in any of your orifices. This is something you really need to start letting go of.
5.	If you have an issue with me

I really have a lot of pity for you. There is a small part of me that feels sympathy for you because you have to know how pathetic it is to literally bombard someone with self-stills and self-shot videos of your masturbatory skills, and from the good things I’ve heard about you (which, I have to be honest, have been fleeting at best), you’re a very motivated young woman. I can see that you work very hard to get what you want. There is a point, however, when defeat is literally raping you down the throat

Look in the mirror. Do you like who you see? Do you feel pride knowing that, [] and I have a baby on the way, but I also have a daughter that fell in love with this man. Would you feel satisfied in destroying that relationship too, or are you just that sociopathic and selfish that you don’t care? I know as a young person it doesn’t always occur to you how your actions will affect others. Because you can’t seem to see that on your own, I’m showing you.

 It doesn’t take a single iota of effort to manipulate others into getting them to do what you want. It does take quite a bit of strength and humility to realize something you’ve done is completely out of line, of course, of the gifts you have that keep on giving), but I’m done with your trash. I’m done allowing you to think your efforts are getting you anywhere. If you think you’ve made any headway with [], [], [] or any of his other friends, you’re sorely mistaken. None of them have any respect for you, none of them want to touch you either.
 
This is the only courtesy I’m giving you; this is a one-time offer: 

Stop. NOW.

I take ABSOLUTELY no issue with making all of this public, because I don’t even think YOU know.

 Whatever skeletons you think you may know about that might provoke you into thinking you can spit fire as revenge, whether they be direct or indirect; I’m stomping that fire out before there’s any attempt to light it.


 Stop acting like a spoiled little brat. You simply can’t have what you want this time, regain some self-respect and dignity, and learn from this. You don’t have to continue acting like a classless tramp. You can decide to be a woman that deserves respect, love and loyalty. Perhaps if you decide to take my advice, you’ll come to an instance later on in life where you’ll be grateful someone called you out on this so you could change your ways. Think of it as a forced epiphany. This is a chance for you to become a better person. 

Or, and end up with a restraining order filed against you.  Whatever you decide to do, keep it far away from my family. 

We are done with you.

**[Prompt #2]: What ethical principle do you find most applicable to the duties of a baccalaureate prepared nurse?**
_______

Author Catherine Pulsifer said, and if a nursing student doesn’t feel accountable for their actions, they won’t feel accountable for their patients once they become a nurse. Accountability is the most applicable principle for a nurse to have instilled to be able to preform their job well and avoid ethical issues. All ethical issues may be attributed to a low principle of accountability. Ethics stretch across a multitude of nursing issues and responsibilities. Nurses must be accountable for maintaining patient confidentiality. They must provide accurate up to date information for their patients. Nurses need to be responsible for their own attitude while at work or in public, and need to feel responsible for the overall quality of care they provide. A major role of being a nurse is alleviating any unnecessary fear and insecurity from the patients and their family with reassurance, yet in my time working as a CNA I was appalled at the amount of neglect, negligence and abuse that the CNAs and one nurse I worked under preformed to ""deal"" with memory care patients. The issue simply is that there are a lot of nurses that don’t feel accountable to their patients. They come into the room of a patient and add to the patient’s distress by being interpersonally blank in their work. Sadly, I've seen and heard of many nurses that simply perform all the skills they're required to do, they need to be accountable for their punctuality, and will create ethical dilemmas. In the end nurses without a high principle of accountability will create adverse affects on the public’s impression of the entire nursing profession and their role in healthcare.

Once upon a time
Varsnor had once been no different from an elf, so many winters ago.

He now ruled the dark swamps of Morgana
Varsnor was a vengeful ruler

The Bog People had tried to overturn Varsnor many times

The day our story starts was nowhere close to being an ordinary day.
The sun had yet to rise
Varsnor met with seven of his most trusted riders

Varsnor looked nothing like his minions, his ears where long, eyes were large, and his mind was sharp as a sword of steel.  

Next to him the riders, small, black skinned and stupid to say the least.
Fear however bound these creatures together in awe of their ruler Varsnor.

Still before the sun had risen
They rode for many moons

After seven moons the ground beneath them finally hardened
They had finally reached Vielsnor
Not long after, they left their Vargs, large wolf-like creatures, behind and ran, hidden in the high grass.

The elves of Vielsnor were no common men.
They could smell the scent of the Bog People from more than a miles distance
They made sure to stay in the right direction of the wind at all times

After much running and even more hiding they finally made it to the farms of Christjorn, all in all, a very easy target.

Scream where heard all the way out to the farmlands
When the men returned there was nothing left.
The houses where burned down

And one young girl, many nights spend looking for her, before they finally gave up.

It was not until the 13 High Elves of Vielsnor came to witness the tradgedy

History

                                   Absolutism V.S. Democracy
	Democracies are forms of government in which the people hold all of the power. An absolute monarchy is the opposite in which one person is given all of the power. During the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries there were lots of ideas going around about the freedom of people, so they pushed for democracies. A democracy was the better type of government during the Enlightenment time period for several reasons.

	One advocate of democracies was John Locke. John Locke wrote in Two Treatises on Government that “by nature all free, no one can be… subjected to the political power of another without his own consent.” By this quote John Locke is saying that nobody should ever be forcibly placed under the control of another person without said person’s consent. To do so was to strip people of the natural rights that all of mankind is entitled to. By saying this, John Locke is saying that there can be no government that the people don’t accept, and that one of the only governments the people will accept is a democracy.

	Montesquieu believed that people were entitled to a certain amount of fairness, and judicial powers are united in one person or body of persons, because such concentration is bound to result in arbitrary despotism.” When Montesquieu says this he means that having one person or body control a government is too dangerous due to the many conflicts of interests the ruling entity and the people can have. These conflicts can be anything from making money, to keeping power. Montesquieu says that he dislikes absolutism, which since he only gives a list of three governments, two of them ruled by one person or one small group of people, he supports democracies.

	King Louis XIV of France of course has a view that monarchies are the best type of government. King Louis XIV expressed that “The head alone has the right to deliberate and decide, there are several instances where the mind has no say in what happens with your body. One of these mindless instances is muscle memory. If something happens and you react right away, your muscle moves without having gotten any information from the brain. Putting this back into that metaphor, King Louis’s body would end up quickly betraying itself.

	Democracy is the best type of government during the Enlightenment period. Not only did a democracy give all people equal rights in a political manner,False,,t5_2s6rw,False,,,t3_1891rv

I've heard and seen nurses lose a piece of their humanity after working for a while and become unable to be there for their patients emotionally. To me out of all the qualities a good nurse requires besides the common ones like selflessness, the recollection of why we go down this path is necessary.

Ever since I was young I had a strong loving spirit and a desire to help people in need. I always felt compelled to be emotionally nurturing and assist people in growing, fit precisely with my ideal career. 


 
The contribution I wish to make for nursing is to improve the quality of care wherever I am, and become unable to be there for their patients emotionally. To me out of all the qualities a good nurse requires besides the common ones like selflessness, and compassion is that a nurse truly requires resilience if they will persevere. For when everything seems like a constant series of unfortunate events, or when feeling frustrated with another difficult patient, the recollection of why we go down this path is necessary. 


	
My daily contribution at work and school is too uplift the spirits of all people I come contact with.  I feel it is the nurses responsibility to never allow the patients to see if your having a bad day as good role models of care, I could never allow myself to not retain the patients and their family  as my first and foremost responsibility. A nurse must take care of their faculties and emotional stability in order to be ready for work everyday.  I know I posses the potential to have the resilience necessary to become a successful nurse for the long haul. Their would be no regret by anyone making this decision if I was to be included in the Dominican University Nursing Program beginning fall 2013.

Prompt:
&gt;Please describe how you became interested in this topic and any experiences that you believe have prepared you to undertake this project. You should also discuss how your research project relates to your graduate school



.



My history with physics is a long and developed one. I have wanted to be a scientist since the age of three, anatomy, evolution, geometry, and chemistry. This instilled curiosity did me well over the years, but I can remember the defining moment when I decided to become a physicist. In 7th grade my math teacher, Mr. *Padaddle*

.

Under some poor advice I believed that a degree in physics was a foolish endeavor

.

I took my first class in Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) with Dr. *Madaddle* last spring. It was an eye-opening experience and I soon realized that I loved the theory of PDEs and using them to model all kinds of physical systems. He noted my enthusiasm and asked me to join his research group here at *UUU*. I was advised to take some very informative classes such as Numerical Analysis, then this is the contemporary application of the subject. BECs are a many-body problem, which is fascinating to me. (needs wrap-up)

.

My hope is that the experience I gain working on this project will prepare me for graduate studies and beyond -- especially in condensed matter physics. Research experience is at a premium in my field

6. Keep in mind that what you are trying to capture is each main point

7. Be sure to quote the author a couple of times to support an idea you are making or to provide the flavor of the writer’s style. Introduce all quotes that are not incorporated into your sentences. Never open a sentence with a quote. Instead,” or “explains” with a comma before the quote. For example: Coontz provides an example that says, “most Americans in the 1800’s. . . .” Don’t use the word “that” before a quote.

8. Be sure to represent the piece of writing fairly and objectively. Don’t distort what the writer has said

9. You can make a universal point in the summary

10. A reaction paragraph follows the summary. In the reaction, parallels, personal examples, and so forth.  You can agree or disagree with the author and say why.

   “Birthday Party” is a short story about a woman who surprises her husband with a birthday cake and song during their dinner. The man is embarrassed as he is the center of attention in the restraint. When everyone settled back down he turned on his wife and made her cry. Although this is a short story

   The Tone of the first paragraph is very relaxed and neutral. The author uses a couple abstract words, but the story gets more details in this long, compound sentence. The author capitalized occasion in the middle of a sentence to show emphasis and specialty.
 
   The third paragraph changes tones and becomes happy and joyous. The details of the setting make the reader feel as if they were in the restaurant sitting next to the couple. Again, thrown in. The sentences in this paragraph are long and compound, almost like run on sentences. There is little to no poetic devices in these paragraphs. The author’s writing style is very simple and straight, to the point.

   Finally, specifically consonance, in the last sentence. She uses the word “gay” to describe the woman’s hat, but it feels out of placed and misused.

1354230111.0,140qcd,Could someone proofread my paper on race in TV?,theaficionado,2,0,0,"I have to determine whether it is positive or negative in the show (Friday Night Lights - Blinders) and argue my point.  Don't worry about my citations


Race in Television
	How race is dealt with on television and in film has been and still is a major issue today.  In Friday Night Lights, and brings conflict to the forefront.  “Blinders” shows race in a positive way, allowing viewers to see both sides of the coin, and opening up the possibility for thought coupled with the viewpoint that there is no answer to the issue of racism.
	This Friday Night Lights episode portrays race in a positive way by giving multiple views of life in a rural Texas town as an African American.  It uses a somewhat multiculturalist view, in this case (Gray).  However, “Blinders” is more of a hybrid than anything else.  Multiculturalist shows tend to address the issue of race as something that must be dealt with.  In this case, the controversy is left open-ended for the viewer to interpret.  
A key segment of the episode is shown in a positive light when Brian’s mother is considering buying a big new house for the family.  However, combined with the tension in the football team, it proves to be too much for Brian, and he starts yelling at the banker.  These two scenes directly contrast and show both the highs and lows of a middle class African American family living in a typically racist state or town.  This is a positive because it doesn’t give a slant one way or another, or directly come out and say why the loan was withdrawn.  It simply ponders the idea that it could be a result of the family that is trying to get the loan.  Racism in determining who does or doesn’t get a loan is illegal, and is a very touchy subject.  The show purposely introduces this aspect of race, even though it does not have to do with football or the school, and the show aims to make the viewer think about the issues that come along with racism
	In the locker room, showing why some of the white players believe that the black players should not take the comments so seriously, and conversely, the black players reacting angrily to the comments.  By bringing up and equally covering both sides to the debate, possibly granting more time to what Brian thinks, the show gives the audience the power to see how each race is thinking, and giving them the power to choose who they think is right or wrong, and it lets the show connect to teenage viewers
	Another explanation of why this episode of Friday Night Lights portrays the issue of race in a positive sense is that it is more of a broadcast show, a nationally broadcast network.  The creators know that the show is being broadcast on to millions of people, of varying ethnicities and ages.  Therefore, the director uses his show to bring up the issue of race, and let people know that it is still an issue in the modern day.  Broadcast shows have the unique ability to act like billboards in a way also.  In this case and episode, Friday Night Lights is able to show the issue of race without taking a side.  This is important because it allows the audience to make the decisions, while the show itself portrays the image, because of the nature of the subject.  In a cynical sense
	In the episode, and I’m here for you, but sooner or later, you’re gonna have to peak out from behind those blinders.”  This comes after the assistant coach makes a rather weak apology for his comments.  Brian’s girlfriend expects him to take great offense to this, yet Brian largely ignores whatever has been said.  The ‘Blinders’ statement has a dual purpose.  It serves as an attempt to shake both Brian and the spectator, or the audience, of the show (Notes) – no matter what ethnicity, or gender they are.
	This Friday Night Lights episode is more of a show about African Americans than it is an African American show (Notes).  The difference between the two is that an African American show would be produced predominantly by African Americans, features only a few African American characters, and has a presumed majority of white spectators – characteristics that match that of a show about African Americans.  This does not, however, mean that there will be a negative connotation associated with the show in question.  In this case, the director is actively exploring the subject of race without placing any judgment of his own into the show.  By being unbiased, “Blinders” allows the spectator to make their own decisions on a touchy subject
	Overall, I believe that the fighting and eventual abandonment of the team by the African American players was just a tad over exaggerated and over dramatized.  However, being a mainstream television show, it is hard to have a perfect mix of drama and reality with the demands of the modern spectator.  “Blinders” acted as a fantastic way of introducing a tough issue, and leaving it an open one for thought.  This Friday Night Lights episode represents the reason why touchy issues such as race should be left open for thought.  The audience, not the director, should determine the solutions to these types of issues.

1353332770.0,13g78f,Need your advice on my research paper on unmanned drones,ndecker,3,1,0,"Unmanned drones
Some argue that it is unethical to carry out military actions from a computer screen. That we shouldn't be able to decide the fate of another human being from a map on a Google earth type program from an office hundreds or even thousands of miles away. Some also argue that drone aircraft will make it easy for police and investigative agencies to “watch” over us in our daily lives. All drones share a common detail; they are flown remotely from the ground by a controller and can carry vast amounts of expensive sensors and equipment. They come in many sizes too, they are cheaper to operate then other manned aircraft, and that they open up job opportunities in new markets and trades never seen before. Drones or UAVs can stay in the air much longer then manned aircraft. The requirement of a constant flight crew can be eliminated from the equation, thus giving them a hypothetical infinite amount of time that they can remain in the air. Drone use in the civil marketplace is expected to grow exponentially in the coming years. Examples of civil applications include law enforcement, border patrol and emergency relief. (Finn) (Samkov) Anyone who is interested can build a basic UAV for around $1000 USD, out of balsa wood, plastic, hobby R.C. parts and if the user desires to fly it out of range
A UAV can be defined as an aircraft fit for flight, or ground operator. They utilize different methods to take off, some use the latest in mobile launch platforms, while others will use the classic runway at an airport or in some cases a dirt road. Design engineers must take into account the payload to be carried for that drone's application. The airframe must be large enough and strong enough to carry not only the power plant and control apparatus' but also any cameras, sensors, any other information gathering equipment, as well as any weapons if the application requires it. Drone aircraft share the same flight systems and fly similarly to manned aircraft. The design calls for; a fuselage to carry the equipment, wings to create lift, and flaps to slow the aircraft while on approach. (Finn)
It seems that UAVs have just appeared on the international playing field in the past fifteen years. But in reality, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, known as (DARPA), as well as NASA began to research modern applications for drone aircraft and some well-known platforms resulted from this effort such as the Helios, Proteus, Altus Pathfinder and Predator. During the Gulf War drone strikes were so effective Iraqi soldiers began associating the sound of a single engine prop plane with an imminent strike- leading to the first instance of humans surrendering to a robot. Currently more than 50 nations use drones for military and civilian purposes. 
Most large drones such as the Predator drone, or High Endurance Rapid Technology Insertion, made by BAE is an example of a drone that can be programmed to fly its mission and land entirely autonomously. Some smaller drones can be remotely flown from the ground in a similar fashion to RC hobby planes. They don’t even need a line of sight for the operator, as they can stream live video to a special pair of goggles or a laptop computer. (Finn) On February 4th 2002, the CIA carried out the first airstrike using a drone aircraft. Its intended target was Osama bin Laden. However, the mission failed to kill bin Laden and resulted in the deaths of civilians. (Sifton) Since the beginning of the war in Iraq and Afghanistan, drones have been used constantly to target leaders and military sanctions of the Taliban and al-Qaeda.  (Black 244) In 2003,000 hours of flight-time on the drones used in the skies over Iraq and Afghanistan. By 2009
Some argue that it is unethical to carry out military actions from a computer screen. That we shouldn't be able to decide the fate of another human being from a map in a  Google earth type program from an office hundreds or even thousands of miles away. Some also argue that drone aircraft will make it easy for police and investigative agencies to “watch” over us in our daily lives. Most of the critique of the spread of drone technology to the civilian sector is centered on that of personal privacy. But what is privacy? Privacy is protection of personal data, pilot error and the potential use of them as weapons. Because they are unmanned, the maintenance requirements are much lower than manned aircraft, thus making them less reliable. The current accident rate for UAVs is 100 times greater than manned aircraft. The Electronic Privacy Information Center (EPIC) argues that the poor safety standard that drones are held to pose a risk to both commercial and general aviation aircraft. In 2007, the NTSB reported that pilot error was the cause of a Predator drone crash, as the pilots on the ground accidentally shut the engine off.  (Finn) 
In addition to safety concerns, it is argued that the overuse of drone technology will lead to a video game mentality where human lives are objectified as ""things to track, spy on and kill."" In the civilian world, drones may bring about an unneeded amount of law enforcement, and that those agencies that operate them will eventually shift their goals from law-enforcement, to public control, containment and eventually restriction of freedom. Some fear ""mission creep, only stopping when a final
There is some debate about how drones affect targets of continued surveillance. Some say that drones raise civil liberty concerns because ""everyone gets monitored, it is believed that police and homeland security will see drones as ""just another tool in the tool box,"" and there is every reason to be concerned about how they will take advantage of their ""new tools,"" and if they will be used to an extreme or not. (Finn)
Since the earliest weapons such as the bow and arrow, ICBMs. The pinnacle of this advancement being the ICBM; but ICBMs are never used. Drones allow the feeling of alienation brought by long range ICBM missions in a practical everyday use. The result is violence with the distance and alienation of ICBMs. This is disturbing perhaps because alienation isn't favored by many. (Sifton) In humans, as with in many other animal species, ""aggression drive"" is often limited by a ""submission"" phenomenon. Victims will shut off the aggression drive in others by displaying signs of submission, such as lowering the head to cover the neck, and raising the hands to show you are unarmed in humans. However, some have argued that the isolation brought on by drones has emotionally distanced the killer from his victim. Drones have brought us to a point of entirely risk-free
Another major issue behind drones is the fashion in which they kill. They are used primarily to target individuals and not specific locations, drones patrol and linger around, looking precisely for a target - a human target, and yet, the perpetrator of the violence isn't physically present. (Sifton) Numerous of innocent people have been killed by Predator attacks. In June of 2010, a drone killed at least 60 people accidentally at a funeral in Pakistan. (Web) Some argue that drone strikes are ""deeply aggravating to the population"" and lead to increased support for extremism. International lawyers have called criticized drone attacks as senseless assassinations, as no target ever had the opportunity to defend themselves
However, and that they open up job opportunities in new markets and trades never seen before. Drones have a vast range of uses, not only in the military field, but the civilian field as well. Specifically the three D's: dull, dirt and dangerous work, thereby protecting human pilots from dangerous situations, stress and fatigue. Drone aircraft can be on standby and be deployed on demand, e.g. surveillance of a natural disaster
In the civil market, assist in relief actions and undertake search and rescue operations. Recently, the UK police have used drone aircraft to monitor the Olympic ceremonies, as well as watch over suspicious looking spectators at the events. The CannaChopper is used by the Dutch police to detect marijuana plants and ""sniff out"" illicit smokers. India has begun using drone aircraft to provide surveillance at ""anti-government"" rallies and used them during the 2010 Commonwealth Games to provide an 'eye in the sky."" In Germany and England small suspicious groups of ""alleged hooligans"" in tight urban environments have been under drone surveillance by police for some time now. In Merseyside England, police were credited to the first drone arrest in the UK when they tracked a teenage thief through thick brush by using a drone outfitted with a thermal camera. The Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department deployed their SkySeer drone, made by Octatron, Incorporated in St. Petersburg F.L., monitor accident and crime scenes and to assist in police pursuits. However, although if purchased
Privacy concerns could impede the vast use of drones; however, and that this isn't different from what police have been doing with helicopters for years. LAPD has reminded citizens that currently, there is no place in an urban environment you can go where you're not being looked at by a video camera. (Finn) The AUVSI, or The Association of Unmanned Vehicle Systems International, is quick to reassure pilots that a large percentage of the 30,000 drones forecasted to be in the sky will be low flying and small, similar to RC models.  (Phelps 64) The FAA will make it a requirement for the controlling agencies that operate their drones to issue a notice of where and when their drones will be flying. (Phelps 64)
The FAA and Joint Planning and Development Office, or NexGen, to replace the current aging airspace system that hasn't been changed much since the 1960's. NexGen requirements will call for the full integration of unmanned aircraft operations across the entire US.  (Phelps 65) 
In order to carry out an ethical drone strike, if they know it is to cause considerable collateral effects on civilians or civilian property. Fourth- Commanders must show constant and devoted care to spare civilians from damage and destruction. Fifth- Strikes must be effective enough to spare the targets from suffering or injury. In other words, kill the target in one shot. Sixth- The strike must be carried out only in true military from, such as a large scale operation or attack. Seventh- Drone strikes must only be conducted by certified, lawful operators to insure maximum accuracy and proficiency. Eighth- Commanders and operators should receive prior consent for a strike from the state in which it is to occur. However, in cases where that state is unwilling to or unable to control the threatening activity within, it is reasonable for the outside force to go ahead with the strike.

Dr.Chin
English 263
3 November 2012

	For many years now, has been influencing the lives of millions of souls all over the spiritual globe. As we know, the results of the influence that this book has can end in catastrophe and cacophony when taken literally. Bible literalists insist on taking the words from the bible at face value instead of soaking in the literary merit that this work of art encompasses. As jesus was known to speak in parables and metaphors in the new testament, so too should the old testament books be analyzed in a similar fashion. The book of exodus has been a citadel for controversy for as long as i can remember. But, if one is able to scrap literal interpretation and examine the ideas and metaphors on a grande scale , a better understanding about the message of Exodus can become manifest. The book of exodus uses metaphors for God, Moses, the Pharaoh
	Most of us are familiar with the story of Moses traveling to egypt in order to entice the pharaoh to release the israelites so they can serve Lord God incessantly. Taken literally, and the deterioration of a great city. If we can take a moment to separate these fleshly elements from story we can explore the ideas that our characters represent. The first metaphor we must explore to reach a better understanding of Exodus is the symbol of Lord God and the role he plays. God can be looked at as the higher nature or intelligence that us, as flawed creatures may aspire to attain, or in other words, our spiritual liberation. It's the calling unto perfection, to rise above mortality and infallibility. Its the ultimate goal of some in life to reach this plateau. Moses, on the other hand can be said to represent the aspiration to reach a perfect consciousness. The road unto which we can reach spiritual perfection. The Israelites, its inability to reach liberation easily. Now, from reaching spiritual liberation.
	We first encounter Lord God, and the god of Jacob, (Exodus 36), or the destination of our spiritual enlightenment as the un-charred burning bush calling out to Moses(Exodus 3:2). Moses isn't even allowed to wear shoes in the presence of God, possibly symbolizing the obtrusiveness of the material world on our paths to spiritual liberation or the disconnectedness from spirituality we experience as a result of the material world. Moses, as stated earlier as the aspiration of spiritual liberation is introduced as a man of righteous morality as he helps the daughters of a priest of Mid'ian retrieve water for their father's flock, (Exodus 2:16). Here we see the idea of the righteous morality of Moses. Containing the noble morality becomes manifest as the idea of Moses being the high road to spiritual liberation. Moses is chosen by God as a means to liberate the israelites,  that have cried out to god for help, is I. Now, or self (Pharaoh). Not until the massacre of all the first born sons of egypt is the pharoah convinced to release the children israel (Exodus 11:5).  It's not until times of great stress and contemplation is the mind allowed to start its journey towards spiritual liberation
	The story of Exodus is a journey of the self towards liberation. When taken at face value, anger and contempt towards the ideas put forward by The Bible.",,False,,t5_2s6rw,False,,

I still remember the look in his eyes. The look was eager, Teryell had been boarded up in a small townhouse for the majority of the last two months, and as I stood there on his doorstep and tried to smile, I knew I was possibly the only way he’d be allowed outside. 

This past summer, and I even had the opportunity to help some with their schoolwork during homework club. 

On the last day of camp, the volunteer couldn’t change the mother’s mind. That’s where I came in: if I could follow the boy around and make sure nobody bullied or hurt him, then maybe the mother would change her mind.

And so there I stood in front of their house

Article: “Little Being Done to Prevent Web Application Threats
Author: Moriah Sargent
Date of Article: 19 September 2012

This article describes the biggest threats our latest programming languages are receiving and way companies can combat them but are unwilling to spend the money and time. 

HTML 5 has “15 years’ worth of insecure Web code we need to clean up, Jeremiah Grossman. 
Attackers are entering malicious code into a Web form input box to gain access to resources or make changes to data
HTML 5 is posing complications with security as threats are becoming harder to find and harder for developer’s to fix. 

Where speed and functionality take top priority when creating a Web application

Grossman briefly breaks down how parameterized SQL statements are used for the attacks. He notes that both XSS and SQLi can be prevented with a context-aware output encoding and input validation.
