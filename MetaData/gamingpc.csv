1359479928.0,17i68v,WARNING: protect yourself when doing an RMA,Markus_Antonius,387,58,264,"Hi /r/gamingpc

We never thought we'd have to give this warning but one of our moderators sent his $400 SuperMicro server board back to ""a well known store"" for RMA. Like most of us he's a very experienced builder and has bought from this store on many occasions. To our utter amazement the store now claims he has bent pins on his mainboard socket and we have no reason to assume this is in any way true.

Regardless

Apparently being a good customer is not enough to protect you from dishonest stores or store employees so please don't rely on your customer relationship with any store to protect you from this.

We've probably all heard stories like this one before but now that this is happening to people ordering stuff professionally we feel it necessary to post a PSA about this.

Feel free to share any similar stories you may have in the comments.

Thanks for reading!

Please avoid questions that might help identify me. My intentions are to be a non-marketing source of information and internal opinions that do not reflect the opinions of AMD (my employer). I need to preserve my anonymity to keep doing this. Hopefully this won't be too boring :). 

 1) Why are you doing this? 

I love computer hardware and gadgets in general, we're seeing a lot more personal connection with some companies (Logitech, for instance, has been pretty awesome at this). Still though, we rarely hear from the people who help design and make this stuff. So in a small part, I'd like to help change that. 

 2) Catalyst Drivers

I'm seeing a lot of hate (some of which is pretty nasty) for the Catalyst team

The Catalyst driver suite used to be a mess... it was hard to use, and that's usually followed up by them saying they haven't used one of our GPUs for years. 

Our *modern* Catalyst drivers are great, I think we're at parity with them in terms of bug rate, stability (some argue that we're actually *more* stable than NVIDIA), and feature set, especially after the 12.1 release. Does having a driver quality similar to NVIDIA mean that the drivers are where they should be? *ABSOLUTELY NOT*. Both companies have a long way to go before they're where they should be, IMO. A gamer should *never* have to open the control panel, but that same gamer should *always* have the option of going in and tweaking everything their heart desires. And personally knowing some of the driver team

EDIT: I'm getting more than a few PMs of people asking how to learn more about GPUs and graphics programming. I love this- being motivated to self-teach is a fantastic attribute. 

-I'd suggest learning OpenGL first. It's very easy to find free tutorials online. A good place to start is http://openglbook.com/. There are also lecture series offered by several schools for free. 

-NVIDIA's GPU Gems Series is awesome

-AMD did their first Fusion Developer's Summit last year. Many of the keynotes are available [here](http://developer.amd.com/afds/pages/2011_Highlights.aspx). If you want to learn about our latest architecture and the future of heterogenous computing

The build has been up and running with no problems since the beginning of September. Currently, hell my GPU's barely reach 40C during intense gaming sessions, and my CPU struggles to hit 65C at full load.

This was an amazing learning experience

**Overclocking is not for laptops! It requires mainboard and BIOS support as well as better cooling

___________

**A little warning**

First off

**Base clock (or reference clock)**

Okay

**Edit:** The Sandy Bridge reference clock defaults at 100MHz with higher default multipliers but the basic principles are the same: reference clock x multiplier = frequency. In the BIOS the Sandy Bridge multiplier is often called the *'CPU ratio'*.

**CPU multiplier**

The CPU uses the base clock and the CPU multiplier to get it's clock speed. For a common 3 GHz processor with a base clock of 200MHz the multiplier is set to 15 as 15 x 200MHz = 3000MHz =  3GHz.

**Locked CPU multiplier**

A locked multiplier usually means that the multiplier has a maximum setting that doesn't allow the CPU to be clocked past it's stock speed. In the case of the above mentioned 3GHz processor this means you can't set this multiplier past 15. You can still overclock the CPU but only by changing the base clock. If you would for instance set the base clock to 220MHz (an increase of 20MHz) the CPU clock would go from 3GHz to 220 x 15 = 3300MHz = 3.3GHz. The downside of this is that this method also increases the northbridge chip and the memory because they derive their clockspeeds from the same base clock.

**Unlocked CPU multiplier**

An unlocked CPU multiplier allows the multiplier to be set higher than it's stock value. If we take the earlier example of the 3GHz processor you could simply set the CPU multiplier to 16. That would result in the CPU running at 16 x 200MHz = 3200MHz = 3.2 GHz. All the while the other components (memory and northbridge) will continue to run at their stock values because the base clock remains unchanged at 200MHz!

**Temperatures and voltages**

Contrary to popular belief

Another thing that can happen is that at high frequencies the CPU starts having trouble distinguishing the high and low parts of the clockcycle (think of a wave form that gets flattened so the difference between the high part and low part of the wave gets smaller). 

This second problem can be combatted by upping the voltages thus making the waveform sharper. This is however not a very good idea in most cases

That's it for the first overclocking article on [/r/gamingpc](http://www.reddit.com/r/gamingpc)! More articles on memory

**Any questions

[Part 2 is here (memory) &gt;&gt;](http://www.reddit.com/r/gamingpc/comments/jliya/article_overclocking_basics_part_2_memory_first/)

Edit: a good point was made in the comments. Some mainboards regulate the voltage for you when you start tinkering with the clockspeeds. Personally I don't worry about that much but I don't push my systems to the far outer limits. Overclocking is always a gamble though much safer now than it used to be. Remember

Lets see.  The 4 rotational drives are arranged in raid 10.  I bought them before the flooding so they cost about 400 for all 4. 

I use the patriot ssd for the OS and applications.  The OCZ drive is use for scratch space and I use a Steam moving tool to move a couple of games onto it.  I'll eventually use it for intel ssd caching on the raid volume when they finally release an updated driver for the x79 sometime mid 2012.  

I currently have the CPU overclocked to 4.7 ghz with 1.385 volts.  I haven't really played with it yet.  I'm fairly certain I could go higher.  Both gfx cards are overvolted to 1.25v and overclocked to 1ghz core and 1450 memory (1.175v 880 core

And of course the rig is fully water cooled.  About $1200-1500 went into just the loop.   The loop requires 3 radiators to dissipate all the heat generated.  a 120 rad

I tried to keep as much of the system inside the case as I could, fans, and all the other WC gear.  Honestly, it took me several weeks of measuring and planning to have everything fit as well as it does.  I **do not** recommend this to anyone.  Please, do yourself a massive favor and buy a proper WC case.  

I made *all* of the power cables in this case.  This let me create exact lengths and exact specifications and plug spacing.  That was a massive task and took 3 weeks to do.  I do not recommend it.   It was a time consuming and tedious experiment.  Took me a week and a half to get good at it.  I went though 100 feet of wiring and almost 100 pins to get there.  The results are nice though.  



That's all that comes to my mind.  Let me know if anyone wants more info or a detailed explanation of anything I did.

For my next upgrade I'll be switching out the gfx cards to 4x 7970 or the Nvidia equivalent (no more dual-gpu cards).  But that is 8-10 months down the line.  When all the next-gen cards are released and driver support is mature


EDIT:  I'm running a 3x1 eyefinity setup using Asus VH222H. They're 21.5 inch screens running at 1920x1080 each.  For a combined desktop area of 5760x1080

1. Create an account on www.artscow.com (Remeber to disable the news emails

2. Go to this webpage: http://www.artscow.com/photo-gifts/mousepad/large-mousepad-160 and customize your mousepad.
Hint: Don't use a picture that is too dark. It might get a little wierd as the mousepads are a bit dark in colour.

3. Put it in your cart and go to checkout.

4. Fear not when you see the price being around the 10$ + postage!

5. Insert the coupon saying ""MOUSEPADFREE"" and see the price magically [vanish](http://www.vanish.dk/img/content/home/vanishhomeproduct3.png) into nothing!

----------------------------------------

_______________________________________

Hey gamingpc people. As usual I was reading through some posts on gaming PCs and as usual I got slightly annoyed by the question: *""how can I make sure I'm not bottlenecking anything""*. I could keep the answer very short by saying *""you can't""* but that won't really help I guess

**What exactly is 'bottlenecking'?**

_____________________________________________

The bottlenecking **euphemism** *(sorry fishbulbx &amp; storelogix!)* is used to describe components that are mismatched performance-wise to the point that one component is held back by too slow a performance from another component. 
Most of you know this but saying it out loud helps get in to the nitty gritty of things.

Most often in PC building it is used to describe a mismatch between CPU and GPU. In the old days when processors were slow and single core this is something that happened frequently. I just saw the crosspost of the BF3 CPU article in /r/buildapc and people were bashing it to hell for 'not accounting for bottlenecking'. Since I didn't want to join the bashing party (and a comment is too short for explaining this properly) I thought I'd address why this is bullshit in a post instead

__________________________________________________

Let's start off with 1 very important fact: **EVERY SINGLE GAMING SYSTEM OUT THERE HAS AT LEAST ONE BOTTLENECK AND THIS IS HOW THINGS ARE SUPPOSED TO BE!** Why? Well it's really quite simple actually. One component is always going to be faster than another one. It's either the CPU that has to wait on the GPU to finish rendering or it's the GPU that has to wait on a slow CPU to give it data to render to the screen. In the rare event that there are no bottlenecks (this does not happen in real life!) it would mean that both the CPU and the GPU are at 100% load all of the time!

100% load on a CPU (caused by your game) is something you do not want because if the CPU is 100% busy it won't have any time left to promptly handle user input. In other words, joystick, network) then 100% CPU load is a very bad thing. 

___________________________________________________________

**Edit:** To make things clear to people: this is a gaming PC subreddit. We're talking about a game taking 100% on all four cores. That is something you do not want. If you're decompressing a large file or transcoding video you want all cores at 100%

____________________________________________________________

The reason it does not happen on modern CPUs is that modern CPUs are almost exclusively **NOT** the bottleneck. Unless you're pairing a Core i3 with a 6990 or an X2 with a GTX590 you are not going to run in to serious bottlenecks on a modern system with a modern game like BF3.

In other words, triple GPU or quad GPU. All the CPU does in modern games like this is collect user input and network input, determine where the players and the bullets are and who just killed you. 

This data is translated in to how a scene in the game looks at this very instant and transferred to the GPU in the form of rendering instructions. The amount of work the CPU has to do for high resolutions or triple monitors is not significantly higher than the amount of work it needs to do for a single 1920x1080 screen. It mostly amounts to more work for the GPU with bigger screens

In other words

**So what does this mean?**

_______________________________________________________________


The bottom line is simple really. **On a gaming system you want the GPU to be your bottleneck!** An ideal performance scenario for a gaming PC is having the CPU at a maximum of about 80% usage (where lower is better) while having the GPU close to 100%. This allows the CPU all the time in the world to process information from the game server and your keyboard and mouse inputs while the GPU is very busy rendering your sleek looking DirectX11 world. Ideal would be for the GPU to end up between 90% and 100%. This leaves the GPU able to respond to new instructions from the CPU in a timely manner.

Don't be scared off by all the smoke and mirrors regarding bottlenecking. A modern fast quad core is unlikely to bottleneck your videocards in BF3 and newer games. By a modern quad core I mean an i5 2500K or an X4 970. Unless you're running triple 570s, dual 590s or dual 6990s I find it extremely unlikely that you'll run in to (the wrong) bottlenecks with your CPU. 

_______________________________________________________

**Mind you

A small word of caution though. Battlefield 3 is still in the Beta phase and not all of the game's features have been enabled. I've seen destruction turned on and off if I remember correctly so we are bound to see some increase in CPU usage for the release version of the game. If you're designing a new gaming rig it would be wise to wait a little while for the release version. By the time BF3 is released

*If you can't wait

 TL;DR: start at paragraph 1

**Comments on part choice:**

* Mobo was chosen because it was the only thing with my color scheme that fit all of my needs (thought about the ECS golden
* PSU was again chosen for colors and the fact that it was available via daily deal
* RAM was chosen because of the overclocking reputation (which held true
* SSDs were chosen based on reviews and daily deal showing up at just the right time

Been wanting to address this for a while now because we regularly get flooded with the same question over and over (and over) again.

* Should I wait for Ivy Bridge?

This is not a valid question. It's like asking ""today is sunny

_________________________

There is nothing known yet about the real world performance of Ivy Bridge **because it doesn't exist yet.**

__________________

The only sensible thing to ask yourself is this:

* Do I want a new computer now or do I want a new computer in 3 months?
* Does a new computer with current parts do what I want and does it have room for when I want more?
* Does building a computer now give me what I want for a price I consider to be worth it **NOW?**

Prices of computer components don't drop significantly until they are outdated. Waiting for Ivy Bridge in the hopes that Sandy Bridge will drop in price might sound reasonable but in reality prices of the aging Sandy Bridge will not drop when Ivy Bridge is introduced. 

_______________

If the past 20 years are anything to go by

_________________

By the time the CPU you want is at a significant low

____________________

People have been playing the waiting game throughout the history of computing for as long as I can remember and nobody has ever won this game.

___________________

People that waited for Bulldozer waited a year
**After having been on the market for months now

_____________________

People with X58 systems have been waiting for Sandy Bridge E for a long time. Now that it has finally hit the market everybody is waiting for..... wait for it..... the next ""stepping"". WTF?!?!

_______________________

People that bought a Phenom II X4 so they could wait for Bulldozer are now waiting for Piledriver.

___________________

People that were waiting for the HD7970 are now waiting for it to drop below the price of a 580. Newsflash: **it never will!**

**But wait a minute

Presets will be the same for all amount of videocards (1-4). 

**DOWNLOAD FROM HERE**:

- [3DMark11
- [3DMark (new version)](http://store.steampowered.com/app/223850/). **Download the Demo** and run the Basic Edition. Don't buy it unless you want to. The results we're taking only include the basic version.
- [Heaven Benchmark 3.0](http://www.techpowerup.com/downloads/2111/mirrors.php). Run benchmark on [these settings](http://i.imgur.com/bBlSF.jpg): 1920x1080 8xAA, Extreme Tessellation.


Screenshots for settings we're using for the tests are here:

[Heaven Benchmark 3.0 1920x1080 8xAA, Extreme Tessellation](http://i.imgur.com/bBlSF.jpg). You will need your FPS and ""Scores"" from this benchmark.

[3DMark11 Performance Presets](http://i.imgur.com/Qfscz.jpg). You will need your P Score and the Graphics Score from this test.

[3DMark11 Extreme Presets](http://i.imgur.com/KArKS.jpg). You will need your X Score from this test.

Please remember to post a screenshot of your settings

Results should be posted by **providing the 3DMark11 link** as it is output by the program after the benchmark

It would also be appreciated if your parts list is listed in the following format:

**CPU and Overclock**                             

**Specific Motherboard**

**Video Cards and Overclock**

**RAM and Overclock plus Timings**

Hopefully I can gather a little help and start a spreadsheet when the results start coming in. Good luck and happy benchmarking.

I'd like to add that all this is done at your own risk as is any CPU overclock and video card overclock. Any questions can be answered either by me or any of the other more experienced users and make sure you ask those which can achieve the greater performance boosts for advice.

1366338252.0,1cni5g,A brief word on anti aliasing.,Markus_Antonius,87,20,29,"Hi /r/gamingpc :-)

Been a while since I've done a writeup on something but I was just reading some comments on high resolution monitors vs low resolution monitors and Anti Aliasing (AA). The theory of a lot of people is that on a high resolution screen you need less AA in order for your games to look good. While this is theoretically true

For the example I will use two often seen monitors:

* The Asus V232H (23""

* The Dell U2713HM (27""

Here are the specs that really matter for needing (wanting) AA:

* The 23"" has a pixel pitch of 0.266mm (translates in to 25.4/0.266  = 95.5 dpi)

* The 27"" has a pixel pitch of 0.230mm (translates in to 25.4/0.230 = 110.4 dpi)

The difference in dpi between the ""high res"" and the ""low res"" monitor is ((110.4/95.5)-1)*100 = 15.6%.

Anti aliasing as you all have probably noticed goes in increments of 2x, which is why AA is heavy on the GPU). 2xAA thus means a 2x higher pixel density than 0xAA or: twice the dots per inch (theoretical dots per inch because your monitor does not really have them, obviously).

This means that the 23"" monitor with 2xAA will have a theoretical 95.5*2 = 191dpi. If you put that picture next to the 27"" monitor with 0xAA

To sum it up

Just something to think about when you buy a 2560x1440 monitor and hope that you can turn off AA. You can obviously turn it off but it won't look better than turning it off on a 23"" 1920x1080 monitor. Not by a lot anyway.

So whenever you think you can save money on something (slower graphics card or one with a narrow memory bus) it's always wise to throw some math at it

**Edit 1:** *the purpose of this writeup is not to discourage buying a high res panel

**Edit 2:** *There are different forms of anti aliasing, AA is not strictly subpixel rendering (as correctly commented on below) but it's closer to subpixel rendering than a blur filter in nature.*

**Edit 3:** /u/NMEMine did an **excellent** writeup on the [various forms of AA and how they work here](http://www.reddit.com/r/gamingpc/comments/szrwr/anti_aliasing_levels_whats_the_point_of_insanely/c4iotrb),False,self,t5_2sq2y,1366389547.0,,,t3_1cni5g

* There are no ""safe"" overclocks! Overclocking is inherently unsafe. If it weren't

* There are no ""safe"" voltages! Overvolting is inherently unsafe and more so than just overclocking.

* If your CPU or GPU does not clock past X GHz it is not broken. CPUs and GPUs are designed only to operate without problems on their stock settings!

* Your CPU or GPU is not guaranteed to work on overclocks and not guaranteed to survive an overclock. If it fails (temporarily or permanently) you cannot blame the manufacturer for this.

The warnings about breaking stuff when overclocking or overvolting are there for a reason! It is because they are true!

The simple fact that bad things don't happen often does not mean they don't happen ever!

Overclocking a CPU or a GPU can cause system-wide instability that manifests itself in various ways. If your system suffers mysterious crashes, driver crashes, blue screens, artifacts or other problems the number one most likely cause is your overclock. Not your PSU, not your memory, not your mainboard, not your CPU

Lately we've been having to remove a lot of posts. It is necessarily to keep posts and discussion on topic and respectful. However we do realize that all the rules can seem a bit daunting at times

A lot of people seem to think we are simply a high-end version of /r/buildapc. While we do offer build help and give troubleshooting advice for high-end builds

Our real focus is gaming hardware discussion.

We get a lot of posts linking articles on new and upcoming hardware and that's great. We love to read them and the discussion that goes on in the comments is great. 

Another thing I'd like to encourage is user generated content. Things like [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/gamingpc/comments/ug9yd/videocard_benchmarking_comparisons/) and all the other links in our Resources &amp; Guides section in the sidebar. We love it when users take the time to add to the community. Reviews of products

We don't just like talking about them either

We also allow posts asking specific questions regarding high end hardware. However we would be appreciative if you provide the appropriate information regarding the question in the original post, this sub is intended for experienced builders. We respect that you want to learn, but please direct ""what is a CPU"" type questions to /r/buildapc or other appropriate subreddits.

We will be pushing the focus back to hardware discussion in the weeks to come.

_________________________________________________

* Please realize that each individual CPU of the same model is unique in the amount of heat it produces. This means that one Core i5 2500K will put out a different amount of heat than another seemingly identical 2500K. This is normal and doesn't mean there is anything wrong. Occasionally

* Higher voltages result in higher temperatures and higher clocks also result in higher temperatures. Upping them both obviously results in... higher temperatures. To keep the lifespan of your CPU as long as possible you have to at least try to keep the voltage as low as possible. Below 1.38V is generally considered to be 'safe' (talking Sandy Bridge here) but the reality is that with any overclocking / out of spec running of your CPU it may fail and your warranty will not cover this damage.

* The CPU can request it's preferred voltage from your mainboard voltage regulation circuit. In fact

* A heatsink does not cool your CPU

* Thermal paste is there to fill up microscopic scratches on the surface of your CPU as well as on the surface of the heatsink. Without the thermal paste these scratches would be filled with air and air is a heat *insulator*. Thermal paste conducts heat better than air. This layer of paste is meant to be as thin as possible while being thick enough to fill these scratches. Because heatsinks and processor casings are precision-manufactured this layer need not be thicker than the diameter of a human hair

* Update 1: [Interesting video that shows how thermal paste spreads under your heatsink!](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EyXLu1Ms-q4)

Sorry for the hi-res screenshots. Basically, but I plan on it soon. I'm running the CPU at a pretty stable 4.7GHz right now, I've done Prime95 stress tests and Intel XTU stressing, and my temps never really seem to get into the 80s, so I'm pretty pleased with the CPU cooler.

As far as gaming goes

Anyway

EDIT: Started messing with overclocking the GPU. I haven't been able to get it to run at 1200MHz stably

[Here's a new benchmark with the GPU overclocked.](http://imgur.com/0ODRn) I'm a little disappointed with the overclocking ability on this card, I just like pretty numbers in benchmarks :)

1329756988.0,pxy9y,Sandy Bridge E recommendations - the why!,Markus_Antonius,67,11,40,"**Why it's a good idea to use Sandy Bridge E as a high-end gaming platform**

There still seems to be a lot of confusion about exactly what Ivy Bridge will bring to the table and what it won't bring. Also

* Sandy Bridge on socket 1155 is CPU (and socket/mainboard) limited to 16 lanes PCI Express total. These are hardwired connections from the CPU

* Ivy Bridge on socket 1155 will be limited to 16 lanes total of PCI Express 3.0. For single graphics card setups this means a PCIe 3.0 x16 connection

* The recommended transfer speed per card for multiple high-end graphics cards is 8GB/s per card. For dual graphics cards this cannot be achieved on Sandy Bridge socket 1155 but it can be achieved on Ivy Bridge socket 1155 with a Gen3 mainboard. For more than 2 graphics cards this speed cannot be achieved with Sandy Bridge socket 1155 and also cannot be achieved with Ivy Bridge socket 1155. 8GB/s for dual cards can be achieved with PCIe 2.0 x16/x16 or PCIe 3.0 x8/x8.

If you build on a Sandy Bridge E platform you can:

* Run 2 high-end graphics cards at PCIe 2.0 x16/x16 (if the cards are PCIe 2.0)

* Run 2 high-end graphics cards at PCIe 3.0 x16/x16 (if the cards are PCIe 3.0)

* Run 3 high-end cards at at PCIe 3.0 (or 2.0) x16/x8/x8

* Run 4 high-end cards at PCIe 3.0 (or 2.0) x8/x8/x8/x8

**None of the above can be achieved with any socket 1155 system!!** High end cards like the HD 7970 and HD 7950 are known to bottleneck slightly in some games and noticeably in other games. No game that exists yet uses these cards at their full potential but given the fact that these are 3GB cards they will be able to run future games with extremely detailed textures and meshes. More detail means more data. More data means more intensive use of the PCI Express connection between the main memory / CPU memory controller and the videocard(s).

When building for 2 high-end cards it is a good idea to build on Sandy Bridge E. Not only is the difference already noticeable in today's games but it's likely to be more noticeable in future games. Unless you are building for last year's games only

* Dual/Triple/Quad HD 7970 

* Dual/Triple/Quad HD 7950

* Dual/Triple/Quad Next-Gen NVidia

And even dual/triple HD6950/6970 GTX 570/580.

This recommendation is not because you need it. **This recommendation is because you can! You don't need dual 7970 either. You get it because you want to and because you can. Why would you want to build a high-end system that is already showing signs of aging because the PCI Express speed is starting to get noticeable??**

Lower cards in my recommendation would do just fine in a socket 1155 system

**This makes just about as much sense as spending $300

Socket 2011 will stay relevant longer than socket 1155. Not because I know what will happen in the future but for the simple reason that it has ample power in every corner and socket 1155 does not.

As for the other benefits of Sandy Bridge E:

* 10MB CPU cache

* Lower latency PCI express (do not confuse this with bandwidth and transfer speeds)

* Quad channel memory

* Possibility of choosing a 6 core

* Overclocking via the base clock instead of just the multiplier

Socket 1155 was never intended to be an enthusiast platform. It only became an enthusiast platform for lack of better options. Socket 2011 was not only intended as an enthusiast platform

**Will you see benefits over Ivy Bridge PCIe 3.0 x8/x8 NOW? &gt;&gt;&gt;NO!&lt;&lt;&lt;**

**Things to consider though:**

* SB-E will allow every single conceivable card setup at the maximum speeds currently available.
* SB-E is a newer architecture than Sandy Bridge and lessons learned by Intel are undoubtedly included in this architecture.
* More PCI express bandwidth is likely to matter sooner than more CPU power. SB-E already has more CPU power than any game needs and it has the reserve bandwidth for future upgrades as well!
* Ivy Bridge is not even here yet but even if it were and it were faster

Lots of people get a 1000W power supply for ""future SLI"" (no immediate benefits!) but nobody gets a superior architecture over socket 1155?

***Final thought: there's been a lot of back and forth in the comments over spending extra ""being worth it"". If something is worth ""it"" is a very personal thing. For me it's worth spending extra because I don't like ugly surprises when I find out later that spending some $200 extra would have been a good idea. For me it's worth it knowing that I did not compromise on anything.***

***To me building a high-end gaming system means going high-end all the way. Sometimes this will not pay off big time but one thing is certain: you won't have lower performance if you spend a little more. The worst that can happen is (almost) equal or better performance.***

***For a lot of young people

***I'm not saying: ""you can't"" or ""you shouldn't"" -- I'm saying: ""I wouldn't"".***

______________
**A Brief Overview of the Physics of Airflow (for dummies)**

Airflow, which are simply just restatements of physical principles such as conservation of energy and Newton's laws, applied to fluids.  Air, as you should know, is a fluid, and its movement is therefore governed by the laws of fluid dynamics.  Central to fluid dynamics is [Bernoulli's principle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernoulli%27s_equation), which simply states that if the pressure (or potential energy) of a fluid decreases, and vice versa (which is simply a restatement of conservation of energy and Newton's second law

______________
**Positive and Negative Pressures - What Are They?**

Basically

The theory behind this is that having more fans (or more powerful fans) blowing air in creates a positive [pressure gradient](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure_gradient) between the inside of the case and its surroundings.  Since there is more air inside the case than outside, the fresh air will tend to push pockets of older air out of the case (through random holes and crevices like the 5.25"" bays and the expansion slots) as they move towards the lower pressure outside.  [This video demonstrates ""positive pressure"" airflow](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qe-2ZqmSGug), but please take it with a grain of salt, since the pressure gradient is most likely tiny (and ignore the YouTube comments).

Conversely, since air will want to move towards the lower pressure system, outside air will seep through any nooks and crannies.

[This page has a few good diagrams that will help demonstrate the different setups](http://www.silverstonetek.com/techtalk_cont.php?tid=wh_positive&amp;area=usa).
 
______________
**What Configuration is Better?**

Well, due to the following reasoning: in this setup, your system should pull cool air inwards through the intake fans and exhaust air out through the exhaust fans and the nooks and crannies in your case (extra vents, expansion slots, etc.).  If you have dust filters on your intake fans, your system should remain virtually dust free, since this scenario only allows air to be brought in through the fan emplacements.  Without dust filters however

I drew out a [positive pressure flow diagram](http://i.imgur.com/7qxge.jpg) to further demonstrate what is going on.  This setup assumes there is a side panel fan and there are two top fans, cool air. The pink arrows represent slow, hot air. Finally, the white arrows represent slow, system temperature air.  In the pictured setup, the top left fan is exhaust while the top right fan is intake.  You can see that this creates a convection cell which possibly recirculates warm air into the case.  This can be fixed by removing the left fan, moving the fans further apart, this circulation is probably negligible

As far as negative pressure systems go, and replaced by a vent or grill.  The positive aspect of this setup is that the system will more quickly cycle out hot air.  The downside is that all the air seeping in through the nooks and crannies will not be dust filtered, and your system is more likely to build up dust.  You will also notice that there is a circulation cell near the graphics cards, which is hard to avoid with this setup.

______________
**Doesn't Heat Rise?**

In a static system, as you do in a PC, then the heat will go in whichever direction you push it.  Therefore, top fans do not always have to be exhaust, and can even be detrimental to airflow in some cases.  Imagine that there is an intake fan in the 5.25"" drive bays in the above picture, and both top fans were exhaust.  In this case, the top right fan would actually suck out the cool air brought in from the fan in the 5.25"" bays, cool air.

Additionally, the air particles vibrate and move faster and spread out (the air expands; basic thermodynamics at work here).  For some fixed, permeable volume, there will be less particles present if the air is hot rather than cool.  The resulting air is ""thinner"", and less dense, and therefore requires less energy to move.  Imagine having a cup of water and cup of sludge (and pretend that it isn't sticky).  If you tilt them at an angle, the water will fall out of the cup quite quickly while the syrup will crawl along.  This is because the syrup is more dense!  In the case of a PC, while the water is the warm air!

______________
**The Cold Hard Reality**

Realistically, you should configure your system based off how powerful your fans are and also the layout of your case.  For example, if you have a fan that will allow you to avoid recirculation near your graphics cards if it acts as an intake, use it as one.  If you can create a strong flow over your CPU using an exhaust fan, do that.  The most important thing is that your system is constantly supplied with cool, fresh, dust free air.  Whatever configuration will accomplish this for you is what you should use.  In my case

The best bet is to draw out your airflow diagram and see what will provide the most wind-tunnel like effect while minimizing dust intake.  Remember your basic fluid dynamics to determine the direction of the airflow.  Of course

Hopefully this helps when configuring the airflow of your system!

**About**

I play games... lol. Right now I'm playing on 3 monitors at 5760x1080 and it can max out pretty much everything. I was originally going to get the evga classified 680's but with the lower memory bit rate they suck on high resolutions... this is my first time back to the AMD/ATI club since my 1950xtx (old). i must say I'm surprised how awesome these cards are. Before i bought the 7970's i had 2 580 1.5gb cards and they did not run 3 monitor games very well at all. I do a decent amount of benching which is why my components are probably a lot higher end then they need to be. The cpu was chosen because i do a lot of cad design and it really does improve my rendering downtime.

Basic components
-----------------

I think most of us know what the basic components inside the computer are but I'll list them first and then go into detail on each of them in the posts that follow:

* The processor or CPU

* The mainboard with all it's components / chips.

* The memory

* The harddisk and/or SSD

* The graphics card

* The power supply or PSU

And ofcourse when we're done with what's inside the PC we'll move on to the peripherals:

* The monitor

* The keyboard

* The mouse

The CPU

The mainboard (AMD)
----------------------

For AMD mainboards we'll mostly be talking about the latest generation of socket AM3+ mainboards. Most of the design however is identical to older AMD mainboards. Please bear in mind that the only *real* AM3+ boards are the ones with an AMD 9xx based chipset. When we talk about the various features of AMD boards here we are referring to 9xx based boards. If you have an older chipset you may not have all of these features.

AMD based mainboards have 2 chips that comprise the mainboard *chipset*: the *northbridge* chip and the *southbridge* chip.

**The Northbridge**

The northbridge on AMD mainboards is mainly home to the PCI express controller. This chip therefore determines how many total PCI express lanes can be used on a particular mainboard. This is why 990FX boards can do x16/x16 dual graphics and 990X and 970 boards can only do x8/x8 or single x16 graphics. The northbridge also houses the IOMMU unit which is a type of memory controller that allows other chips direct access to the computer's main memory in a flexible manner.

**The Southbridge**

The southbridge on AMD mainboards houses the AMD SATA controller

It also *connects to* the onboard audio chip on the mainboard and the onboard network controller(s) on the mainboard as well as the legacy I/O controller chip which houses things like the old parellel printer port

To get some idea of the various components on a modern AM3+ mainboard

As you can see

In AMD architecture the CPU houses the memory controller and so the CPU connects directly to the DIMM slots from it's socket. The CPU also connects directly to the northbridge chip but communicates with the southbridge chip and any devices wired to it via the northbridge chip. For reference

In AMD architecture the connection between the CPU and the northbridge is what is called a HyperTransport link. This name is not unique to this connection

The communication link between the northbridge and southbridge chips is called Alink Express (version 3 in the case of the 9 series chipsets). This name is unique to that specific connection.

The mainboard (Intel)
----------------------

As was the case with the AMD mainboard section we will only be talking about the latest generation of Intel socket 1155 mainboards here (Z68 based). Also

One of the things you'll immediately notice when looking at the Intel mainboard diagram is the absence of a northbridge chip: [Intel Mainboard Diagram](http://i.imgur.com/Kj5pd.png)

Sandy Bridge socket 1155 systems don't have a northbridge chip and instead the PCI express connections that are used for the graphics card(s) run directly from the CPU to the slots. The southbridge chip connects directly to the CPU and houses the same basic functionality as the southbridge chip in AMD based systems.

Here's an overview of the Z68 based architecture: [Z68 Architectural Diagram](http://i.imgur.com/UgzfW.png)

On the 1155 platform the link between the CPU and the northbridge (Z68) chip is called a DMI link. This same link is used on the X58 platform for communication between the northbridge and southbridge chips.

In general
----------

For both AM3+ and 1155 processors the memory controller resides on the CPU. The CPU therefore determines whether dual channel

Comes with everthing you could ever need to customize your GPU (including paint) and a OutBoard VRM just incase you need to give the card a little extra Voltage whilst overclocking...

Also includes extra heatsinks for your cooling needs but **beware**

Never seen these cards in Europe before so once released you may have to source the card in Korea or China.....

1331863789.0,qyro2,Leaked specs - a word of warning.,Markus_Antonius,63,13,59,"&gt;With all the leaked specs surfacing as of late I've done some digging and calculating to see if what is leaked is possibly accurate and to estimate to what extent it might be nonsense fueled by wishful thinking. As we've taken a stand on rumor-mongering as of late I thought I'd share the findings with you on the up and coming Kepler cards.

&gt;Number of streamprocessors / shaders / CUDA cores
--------------------------------------------------

&gt;The new Kepler cards are being made on the TSMC 28nm process. This is the same process the AMD HD7970 is manufactured with. The previous generation of cards was manufactured on 40nm. In effect

&gt;Assuming NVidia has kept their basic architectural structure used in the current Fermi GPUs it would thus be possible to incorporate about 40% more shaders than on the GF110 (GTX 580). This would bring the core count from 512 to roughly 720. **This is a far cry from 1536!** With some optimizations in the architecture I would expect the flagship card to have 768 shaders or possibly even 1024 **but not 1536**.

&gt;Memory bandwidth
------------------

&gt;The leaked specs are talking about a 256-bit memory bus running at a 6GHz effective datarate. This would bring the memory bandwidth of the GTX 680 to 192GB/s which would be slightly lower than the current GTX 580. This in contrast to the HD7970 which sports a memory bandwidth of 264GB/s. **Not bloody likely to be correct on the leaked specs!**

&gt;TDP (heat output) and power usage
----------------------------------

&gt;A proposed heat output of 195W on the GTX 680 is possible but dual 6-pin connectors would bring the maximum board power to 225W. The power usage is bound to be a little higher than the TDP but this still seems a little unlikely. For a heat output of 195W I would expect the power connectors to be a 6-pin and 8-pin configuration. 6+6 can carry 225W of power to the card

&gt;Multimonitor support
--------------------

&gt;Supporting more than 2 monitors out of the box with a single card is among the easiest changes to make. I fully expect a single Kepler card to be able to run 5 monitors. Like with the 7970 though

&gt;Pricing
------

&gt;I predicted the retail price of the 7970 to within $5 before launch. If leaked benchmarks are correct

&gt;This is by no means an accurate prediction of things to come. NVidia may have altered their architecture significantly after Fermi

&gt;**Disclaimer: this is just a quick summation based on rumors versus experience and in no way to be regarded as fact.**

**EDIT**

According to credible leaked information on a Chinese website that just surfaced, 1152-core, 960-core and so on down the line.

**Be aware that this means you cannot directly compare shader count between the 5 series and 6 series GPUs the same way you can't compare shader count between NVidia and AMD!**

So I've been dead set on buying a 780 ever since I bought my 480. My plan in PC building has always been to buy the top end card, and it's been great so far.

The question is, but if it's time to upgrade that's a bit more of a financial burden to plan for, seeing as how I'd need to get a new motherboard and potentially memory too. I currently have an Asus P6X58D Premium with an i7-930 and 6x2gb sticks of DDR3-1600.

So if I threw a 780 in this system,False,self,t5_2sq2y,False,,,t3_1h6qg6

But lets get some discussion going and take a look back at 2012 and all that happened during it. With a lot of new users lately this can be a chance to fill them in on the awesomeness that happens in this subreddit.

So, what topics did you enjoy and what topics could you simply not stand?

During 2012 we've seen a lot of spectacular builds and especially the honorable *Build of the Month* builds. Some but not all were:

* [Caselabs Watercooled by Scudzey (July 2012 Rig of the Month!)](http://www.reddit.com/r/gamingpc/comments/wl0nd/after_months_of_work_my_build_is_complete/)

We've seen the fluctuating war of yet another generation of AMD and Nvidia cards. Including some very heated debates over the 6xx series' choice of bit-bus and Nvidias crazy pricing schemes among other things. 

We've seen a massive increase in 2011 socket builds with the availability and pricing becoming a very easy pill to swallow and everyone getting their hands on a 3820 for their sweet sweet SLI/Crossfire builds.

We've seen water cooling galore and some very awesome case [building](http://www.reddit.com/r/gamingpc/comments/12jt0b/water_cooled_wallmounted_computer_it_took_months/)**/**[modifications](http://www.reddit.com/r/gamingpc/comments/wl0nd/after_months_of_work_my_build_is_complete/)

We started our own overclock benchmarking threads for this small community and got some very nice results so far (more people should join in on this! Links in the sidebar).

We've also encountered quite a few dramas resulting in some very crazy egos being unleashed and they never cease to entertain. So many that even I have lost track of most

Lastly the sub had some moderator changes but, the IRC channel, TS3 channel and Battlefield 3 server. Even if they can be literally hitler sometimes.

1313583697.0,jliya,[Article] Overclocking Basics - Part 2: Memory (first half),Markus_Antonius,54,8,28,"[&lt;&lt;Part 1 here (CPU)](http://www.reddit.com/r/gamingpc/comments/jl3tn/article_overclocking_basics_part_1_cpu/)

Overclocking Basics - Part 2: Memory (first half)
------------------------------------------------------

**A little warning (again)**

There is always a certain risk involved in overclocking. Especially (but not exclusively) when you start playing with the voltages you run the risk of damaging your system. Be aware this is your risk to take and your warranty  on components may be limited or nonexistent if you run your components outside of factory specifications. In other words

**Memory basics**

First off

**Clockspeed**

DDR stands for Double Data Rate. Double Data Rate means that the memory chips can serve up data twice per clockcycle. Why is this important? Well, it's still way faster than DDR2-800 which actually runs at a clockspeed of 400MHz so you didn't upgrade for nothing :-)

**Timings**

Back to why this is important though! As you may have noticed when selecting your RAM

**CAS latency**

CAS latency is the number of clockcycles it takes for the memory to retrieve a piece of data from a memory address. So the lower the latency

**Supported speeds**

Here is where it gets a little more interesting and a little more complicated as well. [Here]( http://i.imgur.com/2VBHf.png) is a screenshot of the memory timings on my PC. Both the BIOS and CPU-Z get these timing values from a table that is contained within your DIMM memory module so you can be sure this is accurate. The BIOS uses this information to automatically configure the right timings for your memory. That is: **unless you start overclocking!**. When you do you need to know what the timings mean because you need to calculate new ones if you clock the RAM on a different value than these predefined tables.

**Higher clockspeed is not always faster**

Yup, but true nonetheless. Consider these 2 calculations:

*First off

* The clockrate of this module is 1333 / 2 = 666.5 MHz

* One clockcycle thus takes 1 / 666.5 millionth of a second. This translates as 1.5 nanoseconds

* The latency of this module is 6 clockcycles at this speed making the latency 6 x 1.5 nanoseconds = **9 nanoseconds**

*Secondly

* The clockrate of this module is 1600 / 2 = 800 MHz

* One clockcycle thus takes 1 / 800 millionth of a second. This translates as 1.25 nanoseconds

* The latency of this higher clocked module is 9 clockcycles

**The 1333 memory in this example is thus 25% faster than the 1600!!!**

Confused yet? I hope so

**A sidenote:** *the same risks and reasons for overvolting memory apply that were stated in the first article about CPU overclocking.*

I already have a 5760 x 1080 setup but not many games support it but when they do support it I would like to utulize it. 

My idea is to have a 1440p monitor set up as the centre monitor and have a 1080p monitor mounted above it on a mount that can be lowered. That way I can just pull the monitor down and use the 5760x1080 setup. and when im finished i just switch it back to my 1440p monitor as the main display

Is there an easy way to do this? Has anyone done this already? I was thinking about some sort of DVI selector switch - but it would be nice to still utulzie all 4 monitors when I'm not gaming. 

Any suggestions?

That was the final drop of me getting tired of reading the same question over and over again. This post will be linked in the sidebar Battlefield 3 section for future reference and ""will this run BF3 on Ultra"" posts will be removed in the future.

System requirements for high
----------------------------

**CPU**

* Phenom II X4 965 or higher (X6
* Core i5 2400 or higher (Core i5 2500K

\* Battlefield 3 scales well over more than 4 cores (6 and even 8). We don't consider any dual core processors to be a solid investment for gaming anymore for reasons beyond the scope of this post. Obviously lower hardware will work too but we consider these requirements to be good enough for a fun experience. This info is provided on a best effort basis. If you need some sort of guarantee we suggest you look elsewhere before committing to buying anything.

**Graphics**

* GTX 560 1GB or higher (GTX 570
* HD6870 1GB or higher (HD 6950

Higher than the 560 or 6870 will allow for a combination of high/ultra settings and/or higher framerates and so will doubling up on those cards. 1GB cards are memory limited more than they are GPU limited so higher detail textures and high MSAA and AF will not work as well as they will on cards with 1.5GB memory or more. This memory limitation also applies to single monitor 1920x1080 setups!

System Requirements for Ultra
-----------------------------

* Dual GTX 580 1.5GB or higher
* Dual GTX 570 2.5 GB or higher
* Dual GTX 560 2GB or higher
* Dual HD6970 2GB or higher
* Dual HD6950 2GB or higher

The dual GPU cards GTX 590 (~ dual 580) and HD6990 (~ dual 6970) will obviously work as well.

1GB cards are not recommended for Ultra because they run out of memory which causes severe drops in framerate.

The ultra recommendations are based on wanting **a minimum of** 50 frames per second or higher on a 1920x1080 screen. It is assumed that if you want to play ultra you will also want framerates that actually allow you to beat someone else instead of being pwned at 30 frames/sec if the action gets intense.

If you are running very high resolution or multiple monitors questions are still welcome.

Hey guys, there will be more game nights in the future, so don't worry if you can't' make it to this one (I don't expect all 4000+ subscribers to make it anyways, hehe).

_______________________________________________________________________

Hey everybody. Well

____________________________________________________________________

**A word on benchmarks**

Benchmarks are often taken as the end-all-be-all of CPU performance (as well as GPU performance) but this is not a very realistic picture. How well a CPU performs depends entirely on what you are using it for. Different architectures will perform better or worse than eachother based on the sort of application you are running on it. Different CPU architectures also come with different mainboards and chipsets and this also influences how your computer as a whole performs in different usage scenarios.

To put it bluntly and simply: the users on this subreddit are gamers. We're not calculating Pi to the 1 millionth decimal all day

So what do we do all day? Or, when gaming this boils down to a couple of things:

* The CPU does the game logic. This involves different stuff depending on what sort of game you are playing.

* The CPU calculates the physics of stuff that happens in your game world. I know a lot of you think this is done on the GPU but most of the time it's not. PhysX from NVidia is a wonderful thing but it's platform specific so game studios can't actually afford to depend on it being on a system. As a result all games can do without it and only a limited list actually benefits from PhysX on a GPU. 

* The CPU handles keyboard

* The CPU handles network input and output to and from a game server.

* The CPU generates rendering instructions and sends those to the GPU for processing.

* The CPU handles sound rendering.

Benchmarks generally don't test the stuff that is needed for game performance (excluding physics which is the only part of the game process that actually involves a lot of calculations).
How well a game performs thus depends on a great many things

_______________________________________________________


**So how about the Bulldozer FX chips?**


The reason this post is titled ""both too late and too early"" is because the launch of these processors came too late to compete with Intel processors on single-threaded performance (applications and games using only 1 core or *mostly* 1 core). Had Bulldozer been launched a little earlier it could have competed with the previous generation of Intel Core processors.

The reason it also says ""too early"" is because most games are still lagging far behind the hardware developments. Looking at the past year

Programmers have always been able to rely on hardware getting faster every year so they never really bothered to rewrite their programs to take full advantage of multiple cores in a system. Much to the detriment of AMD only one upcoming game is known to scale flawlessly over any number of cores: Battlefield 3.

If you're building a gaming system specifically for Battlefield 3 an eight-core FX8150 is not a bad choice. Whether it will give you an advantage in other upcoming games remains to be seen. Building a game engine to scale is a complex and costly undertaking. It basically means re-engineering the entire game engine. However if other game studios don't follow suit

When it comes to Battlefield 3 the Phenom II X6 is more cost effective than the i5. AMD has stated it will phase out the X6 in favor of the new FX processors so where does this leave the gamer?

_______________________________________________________

Unless AMD prices the FX-8150 at the level that the X6 is now it's not going to be a competitive choice for a gaming system. If the price is right I think it will be worth buying it with the knowledge that more games will take the DICE approach and make their games scale over many cores. Buying to future proof however only makes sense if it is also a solid economic choice at this very moment. If the price is between the X6 1100T and the i5 2500K I think the FX-8150 is a viable choice. If the price is upward of a 2500K I don't think it is.


Having said that: bear in mind that unless a quad core Sandy Bridge E is priced very close to where the i5 2500K is now

________________________________________________

**The bottom line**

Bulldozer FX will only be a dud if it is not priced correctly and the same goes for the upcoming Sandy Bridge E. Your games will only really benefit from either CPU if the game programmers make the effort to really get the maximum out of these chips. When they finally do it will all be down to the pricing of the CPUs and accompanying mainboards which will be best bang for the buck. Both will be more than enough bang though.

A graphics card can ask for quite a bit of amperage from your PSU. Should the graphics card draw too much power from the 12V rail of your PSU the following things can be an indicator:

* The PSU's safety kicks in

* The PSU's safety doesn't kick in but the PSU is not able to retain a stable 12V power output and your computer will crash. This may give you the blue screen of death but it may also cause everything to freeze and your screen may go haywire or black.

* The PSU's safety doesn't kick in and various parts of your computer may start smoking or catch fire.

1315596135.0,kact9,[FAQ] Watercooling: a Beginner's guide,Helrich,52,11,40,"The following is a collection of common questions that I see beginner water cooling enthusiasts ask

**Is installing water cooling in a computer hard?**
It's really not much different than building a PC for the first time. You can become fairly well educated by reading guides, I got fittings that weren't compatible with the radiator. Nowadays when I'm doing a water build, that's always one of the things I check.

**Is the cost and effort worth justifying adding a water loop?**
There are really two reasons to water cool.  The first, so you can expect better performance out of your hardware while having relatively low temps. The second reason to water cool is for noise issues. At normal usage with a fan controller, the loudest part of my system is the power supply, and even that is pretty quiet.  The nature of water cooling allows for much lower fan speeds.

**What parts are required to water cool?**
This is where reading guides and checking out other people's water cooled systems really helps

 * Pump
 
 * Reservoir

 * Radiator (and fans)

 * The water block(s)
 
 * Tubing and fittings

 * Liquid coolant 

Sure, temp sensors, etc. that can be very useful, but these aren't necessary for the basic function of the loop.
As far as what particular parts work best as well as where costs can be cut

 * Pump - You'll need a pump to cycle water through your loop. One of the most popular pumps is the Laing D5. This pump is incorporated into a couple different pump bodies, but when in doubt, get the more powerful pump.

 * Reservoir - The reservoir is a coolant holding tank, bay reservoirs have a compartment to hold the pump, which allows for more space savings as well as money savings for tubing and fittings. Spend as much as you want on the reservoir, as there generally isn't much difference in functionality, but more expensive reservoirs typically have more flashy LEDs or other custom flair.

 * Radiator (and fans) - The radiator is where the heat exchange takes place. The most common sizes are in multiples of 120mm or 140mm fan sizes (i.e. a 240mm radiator accommodates 2 120mm fans.).  The most common radiator design is the 360mm, but certain radiators allow for very low fan speeds and also don't restrict flow nearly as much.

 * The water block(s) - The water blocks are the interface between the water and the chips you want to cool.  There are blocks for CPUs, Chipsets, RAM, and hard drives, ordered from most commonly used to least commonly used.  Even the cheapest blocks (generally speaking) will allow for better heat transfer than an air-cooled heatsink, but blocks made from better materials or with better flow designs will obviously allow for better dissipation.  Pick a price range and read reviews on different blocks in that range when deciding. Popular brands are EK, DangerDen

 * Tubing and fittings - These components obviously are what enables the water to flow between the above listed parts. Tubing is generally pretty cheap, UV reactive, or solid colored and the only difference here is personal taste. Note though that anti-microbial tubing typically comes in a silver color, and brand-name Tygon tubing typically comes in black. Anti-microbial tubing is a nice feature for avoiding algae growth but as we'll see in the next bullet isn't necessary. Fittings are the metal pieces that attach and seal the tubing to the parts of the loop. There are two main types of fittings: compression fittings and barbs. Barbs are cheaper and the price savings definitely add up, but take the following piece of advice into consideration: *EVERY LEAK I'VE EVER HAD IN MY LOOPS HAS COME FROM BARBS (EVEN WHEN TUBE CLAMPS ARE USED!)* As a result, I highly recommend dishing out for compression fittings. It could save you from a nasty headache.

 * Liquid coolant - You cannot simply use tap water in your loop


**Is there any maintenance involved?**
Yes.  I usually change the coolant in my system twice a year. That means draining the old coolant out, because it tends to ""gunk up"" over time. Don't wait until you start seeing algae growth in the tubing. If you do see some, then there's a good chance that the blocks/radiator have some too, so you'll need to soak them in a bleach solution to loosen the algae. To deal with mineral deposits and buildup, add a 25% mixture of distilled white vinegar to the coolant and cycle it for at least an hour.

**Where should I buy water cooling parts from?**
Newegg carries a very limited supply of water cooling parts. If they have the part you want, sometimes you may find something not necessarily ""for"" PC water cooling, but that will work. For example, I recently found out about [SharkBite](http://www.sharkbite.com), a company that makes fittings for PEX tubing. They make plastic elbow barb fittings for 1/2"" and 3/4"" that cost under $2.00 a piece. This is a really nice alternative considering that 90 degree rotaries cost between $17-20!

just a short housekeeping message here to please be mindful of our rules against speculation. We've set up this forum from the beginning to keep information as accurate as possible to avoid disappointments or even failing components due to overclocking or other tweaking.

Please be aware of the following examples:

* Don't leave the impression that overclocking (and/or overvolting) any component is ""safe"". By extension

* Bottlenecks are not always in the same place. Your computer can bottleneck on the CPU in one game while it bottlenecks on the graphics card in another game. ""Will X bottleneck Y"" can therefore not be generalized easily. Besides the game, even when you quote multiple sources. We have a lot of people gaming on 3 monitors with dual cards and the tests so far seem to show that in that scenario it actually makes a pretty big difference. You'll be hard pressed to find those benchmarks from reviewers but we are in the process of running more of these tests ourselves. Statements like ""you'll never need more than a &lt;insert here&gt;"" are therefore risky because they can earn you a ban if they turn out to be incorrect.

Having read ""xyztech.com"" does not make you an expert so if you don't know

_________________________________________

I've been wanting to do an article for a while now that focuses on aspects of performance that a lot of people tend to ignore. A lot of people look at benchmarks to get some idea of the frames-per-second advantage gained by for instance adding a second graphics card. A lot of people also tend to want to 'max out' games. While I certainly understand wanting to have eye-candy I see a lot of people putting the eye-candy ahead of gameplay.
I can imagine some of you thinking ""but my rig does 60 frames per second maxed out so it won't matter right?"" Wrong actually.

**Why 60 frames per second is not really 60 frames per second**

To explain this statement we need to dig a little deeper into how monitors work and how monitors and graphics cards work together.
A monitor has what's called a ""refresh rate"". For most current monitors this refresh rate is at 60Hz. What this means is that a monitor redraws the screen every 1/60th of a second. Saying ""every 1/60th of a second"" rather than ""60 frames per second"" is important for what I'm trying to explain. **A monitor can't draw 60 frames per second

**So what's the difference?**

Well, encounter an enemy etc. the scene is sometimes just a little more complex than other times. Whenever rendering a scene takes longer than 16.7 ms it shows as stutter, especially (**but not exclusively**) if you have enabled vsync.

What's more

**Elusive performance gains**

A better graphics card or maybe an SLI or Crossfire setup may not seem to make much of a difference to the naked eye when looking at benchmarks but while researching smooth gameplay I came across some very interesting measurements in an article that researched Crossfire and Triple Crossfire setups.

Take a look at this graph: [HD6870 vs Dual HD6870 vs Triple HD6870]( http://media.bestofmicro.com/Crossfire-SLI-stuttering

What you see here is that Dual 6870 more or less doubles the framerate. Triple 6870 also more or less doubles the framerate **however**: the triple 6870 setup has very smooth framerates across the board. Looking at the triple 6870 in a frames per second benchmark would prompt most people to yell: ""triple 6870 is bullshit
As you can see from the graph

_____________________________________________

**Memory restrictions**

I've been doing a lot of measurements on Battlefield 3 gameplay on what most of us probably have: a single 1920x1080 monitor. When doing measurements something else caught my eye. For running the game on ultra you really need extra headroom in the videomemory department. By now this is well-known but I want to share with you a pretty good way to tune your performance using MSI Afterburner (unfortunately this only works on NVidia based cards).
Instead of using it only to overclock your videocards you can use it for something much more interesting. Dual GTX560 1GB has enough rendering power for ultra settings but unfortunately it does not have enough memory (one of the reasons you see the first 2GB 560s popping up now).

____________________________________________

MSI Afterburner allows you to show the video memory usage in the on-screen display. If you start by setting the game on all high and play for a few minutes you can see how your videoram usage behaves. As long as it stays below 980MB the game stays very playable

Tuning the settings down so the game doesn't max out the videomemory prevents these performance degradations from happening almost completely!

----------------------------------------------------------

_______________________________________________________

Hey all! I've noticed a lot of scepticism surrounding multi-core gaming systems as well as a lot of myths on this subject like the one that ""more than 4 cores will never make a difference""

**Dual core**

_________________________________________________________

This is where all the confusion really started. When the first dual cores hit the market

Dual processor and quad processor systems (x86 based) have existed since the late 90s (I programmed the first of these back in 1998). Programming these isn't any different than today's dual and quad core processors though.

These multiprocessor systems were not in any living room or PC gamer's warroom however

Dual core did bring a slight advantage to gamers though because part of the operating system (Windows) would always be running on the free core so the operating system would take up a smaller part of the processing power from the core the game was running on.

**Quad core**

________________________________________________________

With the introduction of the quad core processors

True multicore support requires that you try to split up as much work as you can. This involves dividing the calculations (game logic) in to parts that you send to different threads (=cores in this case) in order to be processed. While this may sound easy **it requires the entire game engine to be redesigned almost from the ground up.** Not only do the programmers have to split up the work in to smaller tasks but sometimes one task needs another task to be completed first because it needs the data that was produced in the first task.

**More than 4 cores**

__________________________________________________________

By mid 2010 it started to become clear that more than 4 cores was going to be a reality. With advances in process technology (32 nm was in sight) it was becoming easier to stuff more cores on to a processor die. 

At the same time

Game developers are now (2010) starting the process of upgrading their game engines to make effective use of more than four cores. The easiest way to do this is to split up the work in as many little pieces as possible. 
Additionally you'll need a task scheduler in the game engine that distributes these pieces over the cores. At the same time this scheduler needs to make sure that tasks that require output from other tasks are run in the correct order **and if necessary wait on eachother.**

Since sometimes tasks wait on other tasks **you will never see a multicore system maxed out by a game! This does not imply at all that the games are not using the extra cores and benefitting from them.** It's simply an unavoidable reality that you will never max out *any* multicore system during gaming. The more cores you have

____________________________________

*Azurphax raised a valid point below in the comments. While you technically won't max out 4 cores for example

_______________________________________

Ofcourse there are still limits above which you'll notice no more improvement **but this limit is not at 4 cores.** Where this limit is would depend mostly on the game and game engine driving it.

**Game engine design**

______________________________________________

Bear in mind that quad cores have only recently become mainstream and that re-development of game engines has only recently started. That's why **currently** you don't see many games benefit from more than 4 cores. Remember though that even if a game doesn't max out your quad core this doesn't mean that it won't benefit from more. It's simply impossible to max out multiple cores all the time.

This rules update has been a long time coming. A recent post that could have been answered by reading a mainboard manual prompted us to post this update ahead of time. That said: **do your research!** We're here to discuss interesting hardware and help eachother solve problems. We're not here to Google for you and download and read the manuals you should have read before posting a question.

Without further ado


**The 4 Cardinal Rules:**

* Don't post incorrect information.
* Anything that can easily be found with Google does not belong.
* Newbie and low-end stuff goes in /r/buildapc
* Discussing or appealing a ban can only be done by using the modmail link. If you start privately messaging one or more moderators about this the ban will become permanent and your address will become blocked.

**General Rules**

* ""like [insert anything here] on facebook"" is considered spam.
* **Do NOT** follow people around trying to find fault in everything they say. If we see you doing this
* This subreddit is first and foremost about high-end hardware and not about saving money and / or ""bang for the buck"" !!!!
* Off topic posts will be removed
* No memes or rage comics.
* Arguing with a moderator will only ever end one way. Mod Sass is grounds for being beaten IRL
* Be respectful towards others. We do ban if you don't adhere to this principle!
* Technically incorrect comments may be removed.
* If you think a post is inappropriate feel free to hit the report button.
* Links to rumor or speculation must be clearly marked as such in the post title. Not doing so will get the post removed.
* No fanboyism. Fanboys will be shot on sight.
* Offensive language can get you banned. Normal frustration or excitement using words like ""fuck"", ""retarded"" or any other outing that can be taken as discriminatory, inflammatory or hate-inciting. Flat out racist or other discriminatory remarks will get you banned. Instantly.

**Specific to making new threads**

* New build help requests should be posted in /r/buildapc. We make an exception for x79 builds and only from users that are not new to building PCs.
* Build log albums of finished PCs of any budget are always welcome. **Pictures of boxes are not!**
* Don't use any [tags]
* For laptops: /r/suggestalaptop is the right place.
* Do your research. Other users are not here to Google for you or read the manuals that come with your stuff for you.
* Crossposting between /r/hardware 
* No Sensationalism. Or Misleading headlines
* Pcpartpicker component lists are required when discussing pc problems or new builds.
* Crashing for freezing problems with your PC may only be posted if these occur at stock CPU and GPU settings!

**Specific to posting comments**

* Do not give technical advice on subjects you are unfamiliar with! If we encounter advice that can prompt someone to make technically bad decisions you won't get a warning
* High-end PCs are often used for more than just gaming! Don't presume to know what's best for somebody else.

In case of doubt we will still defer to our [older and more elaborate rules](http://www.reddit.com/r/gamingpc/comments/l2t6o/rules_the_sequel/). It's our sincere hope however that these simple guidelines will be enough for everyday situations.

Okay now that we have the mainboard basics down

The CPU
---------

There are a number of things of importance about the CPU when building a gaming PC:

**The package** 

This is the other side of the socket if you will, a 1366 package will fit in socket 1366 and so on. Socket 1155 has 1155 pins running from the CPU to the mainboard, 1366 has 1366 pins, AM3 has 941 pins and AM3+ 942 pins. The lower number of pins on AM3 and AM3+ is due to the PCI express lanes not running from the CPU but from the northbridge chip. More or less pins does not mean faster or slower.

The package really is just a package [as you can see in this picture here of a Core i7](http://i.imgur.com/4RLHN.png) :-) The shiny piece of silicon in the middle of the package is the actual processor (or: what you pay your ~$200 for)! The metal casing that usually encloses this is really the first stage of the heatspreader :-)

**Processor cores**

Moving on to what is actually in (or on) that piece of silicon

**Cache**

It used to be that cache was not as overlooked as it seems to be lately. The cache memory of a processor is actually **one of the most important factors that determine performance!** The general rule here is that the larger the cache the better the performance. There is a point at which larger cache is going to slow the processor down (we'll talk about why that is later) but the cache sizes on modern processors are obviously not so large that this occurs (who buys a more expensive CPU that is slower?).

That last pun leads us to another factor of how cache size is determined. Cache memory on the CPU is a special and ultra fast kind of memory that takes up a lot of space on the processor die. Making it larger costs money but it also takes up space that is sometimes better used for putting an extra processing core on that same die. So usually the cache size and the number of cores are a compromise that (should) make for the optimal performance.

To give you an idea of how big that cache area is in a real-world example

Since we're on the subject of cache

Now back for a minute to why cache matters. The fact is that **most of the operations that a processor does takes place in the cache**. A processor in the old days read an instruction from memory

**The memory controller**

As was stated in the mainboard post

This memory controller also determines what type of memory can be hooked up to the processor (for AM3+ and 1155 this is DDR3) and the speed of that memory. For AM3 this speed is up to DDR3-1333 but most AM3 mainboards allow you to overclock the memory controller and thus have speeds of DDR3-1600 and higher. For Sandy Bridge and Bulldozer higher speeds are supported out of the box.

(Integrated graphics)

As you can see

Inside the cores
----------------

One of the main reasons why current Intel processors are faster than current AMD processors has to do with the way things are organized inside the cores themselves. As I explained earlier

Manufacturing process
-----------------------

Year after year the transistors (building blocks that chips consist of) get smaller. Current Sandy Bridge processors are manufactured on what's called a 32nm (nanometer) manufacturing process while AMD's Phenom II processors are still manufactured on a 45nm process (Bulldozer is also 32nm). The smaller the transistors on the die are the less excess heat they generate and the cooler a processor will run. Besides running cooler the processor will also use less power. This is the primary reason that older processors run hotter than the current Sandy Bridge processors. I cringed just a few weeks ago when a reviewer was surprised that the ""Hyper 212+ cools an i5 better than a Phenom II"". This is a load of bullcrap. The Phenom II simply produces more heat!

With smaller transistors achievable clockspeeds also get higher. [A brilliant explanation of why this is can be found in ***Dascandy's*** comment below

Smaller transistors is one of the reasons you can clock your i5 a little higher than your Phenom II. I'm purposely saying ""a little"" here because contrary to popular belief not nearly all i5 processors can reach 4.5GHz. In fact most of them hit a brick wall at around 4.2 - 4.3 GHz while the Phenom II hits this wall at 3.9 - 4.0. Only 100-300MHz difference in most cases. 

While we're on the subject of manufacturing: CPUs (and all other chips) are made using a process called ""lithography"". Basically this means that transistors are etched onto a clean, this is just luck of the draw. It's also the reason that some i5 processors can overclock higher than other ""identical"" i5 processors. There is nothing wrong with yours, just don't forget that even the i5 2500K is only guaranteed to operate successfully on stock clocks!

Overclocking Basics - Part 3: Memory (second half)
---------------------------------------------------------

**CAS latency revisited**

As you remember from the previous article we only looked at CAS latency combined with the memory clock speed. These two are the easiest factors to determine what speeds you'll be getting from your memory. Keep in mind though that these are ofcourse not the only factors. Once a specific memory address is being accessed

**CPU cache**

Back to the CPU? Yep

CPU cache sizes have gotten larger in recent years and you might know already that the larger the CPU cache

It's important to know about the CPU cache because these days it can grow as big as 6 megabytes

If you take today's games that ratio is even more skewed. In today's games well over 99% of the space they take up is pure data. Far less than 1% is actual instructions for the computer.

While most of a program might be loaded into the computer's main memory when that program is started up

**This is the reason memory overclocking doesn't give you a real performance edge!**

It's true that for some specific scenarios faster memory might be beneficial but normally the main memory is being accessed at intervals that 1333 memory can easily provide.

Gaming (this is a gaming subreddit after all) hardly benefits at all from increased memory speeds

**For the most part however

If you can afford fast memory then by all means do

**GPU memory**

Now there's an entirely different story. As you may have noticed

A videocard's main job when (3d) gaming is to take textures (skins for 3D objects in the game) and fold them around 3D objects using mathematical transformations

The way a GPU accesses it's videomemory thus severely differs from the way a CPU accesses it's main memory! A GPU accesses the videomemory billions of times per second when it's drawing you a 3D picture. That's why videomemory is way more expensive. It has to be much faster than the main memory that sits on your DIMMS. 

It's also the reason video memory (GDDR5) runs much hotter. As you may have noticed

As you may have surmised the memory talk served primarily as a warning not to put too much effort in it (the returns are marginal) and as a way to introduce you to memory that matters more :-)

**Next up: The GPU :-) I will try to get to this tomorrow!**

A graphics card can ask for quite a bit of amperage from your PSU. Should the graphics card draw too much power from the 12V rail of your PSU the following things can be an indicator:

* The PSU's safety kicks in

* The PSU's safety doesn't kick in but the PSU is not able to retain a stable 12V power output and your computer will crash. This may give you the blue screen of death but it may also cause everything to freeze and your screen may go haywire or black.

* The PSU's safety doesn't kick in and various parts of your computer may start smoking or catch fire.

**What DOES NOT happen:**

* Your performance drops.

1322394547.0,mqsq1,Myth vs. Fact: Gen3 Mainboards and PCI express 3.0,Markus_Antonius,40,1,21,"Hey everybody

just a small post in a series that will address common misconceptions and misuse of buzzwords. Since there seems to be a lot of confusion regarding PCI express 3.0

What is PCI express 3.0?
------------------------

I will only address the most basic aspect of PCI express 3.0 in this post: transfer speed and related bandwidth. There is more that separates 3.0 from 2.0 but for the purpose of this discussion it's of less importance.

The transfer speed of PCI express 3.0 is double that of PCI express 2.0 (or 2.x for that matter) ***per lane***.

Effectively this means that when using a single graphics card on an x16 (= 16 lane) PCIe 3.0 connection vs. a 16 lane PCIe 2.0 connection

Gen3 mainboards and Sandy Bridge processors
--------------------------------------------

In Sandy Bridge architecture the PCI express lanes that connect to your graphics card run from the CPU. Sandy Bridge CPUs only support PCI express 2.x connections. **In effect this means that if you are using a Sandy Bridge CPU (ANY Sandy Bridge CPU) you won't be using the Gen3 facilities of your mainboard and your PCI express connections will be 2.x!!!**

Only Gen3 boards with a socket 1155 **Ivy Bridge** processor will be able to use PCI express 3.0 and only **if the graphics card(s) are also PCI express 3.0.** In ever other case you will be using PCI express 2.x!!!

Dual card configurations
-----------------------

As stated earlier the bandwidth per lane doubles. In effect this means that if you are running Crossfire or SLI on a x8/x8 mainboard and you are running at 3.0 speed

Given the fact that there is not a lot of performance difference between x8/x8 and x16/x16 right now

""Saturating"" the connection
---------------------------

I always get a headache when people talk about ""saturating"" a PCI express connection because using that word implies that they don't understand what is going on at all. Please let me enlighten you:

* Transfers of information to your graphics card over the PCI express bus happen from your main memory via the PCI express bus to your graphics card memory. How fast this happens depends on the transfer speed of your main memory and the speed of your CPU has absolutely nothing to do with it!!!

* 1333 single channel memory has a bandwidth of 10.6GB/s and a PCIe 2.0 x16 slot has a bandwidth of 8GB/s. A PC with DDR3 1333 memory will thus ""saturate"" a PCI express 2.0 x16 connection for the duration of a transfer.

* 1333 dual channel memory has a bandwidth of 21.2 GB/s and a PCIe 3.0 x16 slot has a bandwidth of 16GB/s. Any PC with DDR3-1333 dual channel memory will thus ""saturate"" a PCI express 3.0 connection for the duration of a transfer.

* Only 1 PCI express device at a time can do a transfer so it doesn't matter if you have 2

* The faster a transfer is done to one graphics card the sooner another transfer to another graphics card can happen so speed **does matter in the end!** It just doesn't depend on the factors most people think it depends on!

The bottom line
---------------

* There is no point in buying a Gen3 mainboard if you are not planning to buy both an Ivy Bridge processor and Gen3 videocards! Absolutely no point. Ever.

* Speed matters but it will be a while still before we start to notice it in real world gaming scenarios.

Questions welcome as always.

1319173721.0,ljltr,A word on Power Supplies - Part 1,Markus_Antonius,43,2,33,"**A word on Power Supplies - Part 1**

This post has been in the making for a while because there is quite a lot to say about computer PSUs. A lot of people used to consider the PSU one of the least important parts of a PC that they preferred to spend as little money as possible on. Others think that when overclocking and installing dual graphics cards they are in need of a huge power supply and race towards the 1000W models.

__________________

Our demographic - the enthusiasts - have known for a while that the power supply is actually one of the more important parts in a PC but still the parameters by which we choose them aren't always the correct ones. Time to clear up some of the questions on the subject of power supplies.

__________________

To kick off part one I thought I'd start with a list of commonly asked questions. With each answer we'll also dive into related stuff as it comes up.

**Does a 1000W PSU use more electricity than a 500W PSU?**

No. How much a PSU uses depends on how much the components it supplies power to are demanding. In other words

***However:*** the two power supplies may have a different *efficiency*. How efficient a power supply is also varies as the load on the power supply varies so the real answer is not as easy. Suffice it to say though that the size of your electrical bill depends mainly on the components inside the computer and hardly on the Wattage of the PSU. 

The reason for not wanting a 1000W power supply when only using 500W is however one of efficiency. The lower the load on a power supply the worse the efficiency gets so it is still important for your electrical bill not to use a PSU with a huge overcapacity.

__________________________________

**Efficiency

Until the arrival of the 80 PLUS bronze

A 500W power supply can **supply** 500W of power to your components. If this power supply is 70% efficient this means that it would draw about (500 / 70) x 100 = 714W from your wall socket if it's under full load. Even if you are not particularly environmentally conscious it is still a good idea to buy an 80 PLUS power supply because at these power loads your wallet will thank you.

**A word of caution on Power Supply Ratings**

There is no official rating for power supplies. Therefore the Wattage of a PSU is rated by the manufacturer. This is part of the reason you see a lot of people with severe overcapacity on their power supplies. Some power supplies labeled 500W can deliver a peak Wattage of 500W while other power supplies labeled 500W can deliver 500W ***continuously***. The higher tier brands tend to specify the continuous power while some of the lower end power supplies are labeled with their peak Wattage. In addition

_____________________

**Non OEM brands**

Two top brands that are also manufacturers are SeaSonic and Enermax. These power supplies are made using high-grade components and carry their continuous rated Wattage on the label. Due to the high-grade components and usage of the continuous Wattage these power supplies may **appear** to be less value for money but in reality they are usually among the top value for money offerings. A 650W SeaSonic unit is often a better choice than an 800W unit from a lesser brand. More expensive power supplies usually also have more extensive failsafe measures in place and are thus safer for the expensive components inside your PC.

We'll close of these series of posts with a list of /r/gamingpc recommended PSU brands and models.

* Spamming (very few). Needless crossposting constitutes spamming.
* Rude behavior, or bad manners (most)

There are no people on the list for **any** other reason than the above. Being ""right"" or ""technically skilled"" or ""extremely intelligent"" is not acceptable compensation for lack of social grace. You have been banned for bad manners. 

Banning is not a powertrip. It's purpose is to keep you from poisoning the atmosphere in our little corner of the internet. Nobody wants or needs power over you. We know this is hard to believe

____
____

**Q:** I don't know why I was banned.

**A:** This is not a question. This statement holds the answer you were probably looking for. If you don't read the rules you won't understand why you were banned.

______

**Q:** Your rules did not exactly match what I did.

**A:** We wrote these rules and we interpret them. You did not bother to ask for clarification.
______

**Q:** I did not mean my comment the way you interpreted it.

**A:** Not a question either. The answer you are most likely looking for is simple though

______

**Q:** This subreddit should not be the way it is.

**A:** 7, the beautiful thing of reddit is that setting up your own subreddit and running it differently is always less than 4 mouseclicks away.
______

**Q:** FU

**A:** Not a question. Have a nice day.
______

**Q:** The OP was throwing away his money.

**A:** Not a question. And probably not the answer that OP was looking for.
______

**Q:** Nobody needs the brutal hardware OP is considering.

**A:** Not a q... ow f... it. Did OP ask you what he needed or tell you what he wanted? Did OP ask you to tell him why he doesn't need a good videocard or did he/she simply asked if the components would work together? If you just want to hear yourself talk
______

**Q:** I know more than you do.

**A:** Not a question. If you think your unique skills are essential

_____

**Q:** But I did not understand the rules!

**A:** What we want is an atmosphere where people feel comfortable discussing $100 on case lighting or $800 on a videocard. Where people can discuss $100 on a videocard if they want to. Where people are not made to feel bad about having money and splurging for some sexy hardware but also where people don't need to feel bad if they don't have the money.

**If people insist on making that impossible by requesting that we produce a flowchart

**Neither justification will be accepted.**

______

**Q:** Will I get unbanned?

**A:** [Every year at thanksgiving we will issue a single pardon.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Thanksgiving_Turkey_Presentation)

I ignored a bunch of mediocre reviews for the Thermaltake case because I liked the look of it. That was a mistake. The case isn't bad in any way. It's just not worth the price... 

The mounts for the h100 are not square. It seems to be a common complaint but I didn't see it until after I'd been bitten by it. If I'd known... I dunno. I'd have probably ended up with an air cooler. 

OMFG. It's so fast. I haven't even begun to tune it

I can run The Witcher 2 in Ultra on a 6020x1080 3D Surround desktop at 60fps. I can run Deus Ex HR and Witcher 2 in 1920x1080 windows at the same time at 60+ fps. 

I can detonate 36, and resolve the entire detonation in less than 4 minutes.  

Portal 2 in 3D is insanely good. 

Marvel Super Hero Squad Online in 3D is insanely good

I'd pay $49.95 for a utility that let me swap quickly between a multi-desktop display and the surround desktop. This is a long standing request for Nvidia

Overclocking Basics - Part 4: Overclocking the GPU
---------------------------------------------------------

**The GPU**

Here's where it gets a little murky unfortunately. We all know there are two major GPU companies out there at the moment. While this is good for everybody because it lowers prices and speeds up performance gains, the amount of calculations per second that's being done on a GPU is positively mind-boggling. Take for example one of the most popular cards at the moment: the NVidia GTX 560 Ti. This card is capable of 1263.4 GFLOPS. This means it can perform 1263.4 BILLION calculations per second. Just a few years ago this was only possible on supercomputers.
Please take a moment to try to wrap your head around that before you start torturing your GPU :-)

**The video memory**

Here we run in to a second roadblock for overclockers. While the architecture of GDDR5 memory is not exactly secret, not much help there either.

**The bottom line**

First off, sorry...) **Overclocking can damage your videocard and possibly other components and you may not be able to get away with using your warranty. Probably even less so than when overclocking the CPU! GPUs run very very hot! Mine went up all the way to 100C on stock clocks when testing! You need to really watch the temperatures when you start doing this and have your heart medicine at the ready. Proceed at your own risk!**

Have I discouraged you yet? If you're still here, do find it.

* Start with the GPU clock. Increase this clock a tiny bit at a time

* After upping the GPU clock with a small step

* When you have your monitor program (GPU-Z) running

* In Furmark, 8x MSAA Alti-aliasing, Dynamic Background  &amp; Dynamic camera. This will heat up your GPU considerably!!! Heed the warning that the program gives you and remember you can wreck your GPU if you push it too hard or if you have bad luck.

* With the settings done click [BURN-IN test]. It will start testing in windowed mode so you can keep an eye on your GPU temperatures. My GPU can go up to 100C according to NVidia specs but to be honest I don't feel comfortable with that much heat. Here's where gut-feeling comes in

* See how much your temperatures shoot up. If you start to feel uncomfortable with it

* If it appears stable you can stop the BURN-IN. I usually don't let it run longer than 2 minutes.

* **Extra step for stability testing inserted here! Before proceeding it's wise to at least check your GPU stability (rendering test) with OCCT. OCCT is discussed in [Part 6 here](http://www.reddit.com/r/gamingpc/comments/jonvr/article_overclocking_basics_part_6_tools_for/).**

* This time in FurMark
Repeat the above steps (increase clock

**At any time during BURN-IN or benchmark your computer may freeze!!! When it does

Once you have found your stable maximum clock setting

**If the game freezes or crashes

*I realize we've not gotten to the videoram part yet but this story is getting long so I'll put up some pointers on the memory clock in the next post.*

**One more warning

1341726659.0,w7n58,GTX 680 Lightning - Overview &amp; thoughts,MrMarauder,39,9,36,"[MSI N680GTX Lightning](http://i.imgur.com/OOS89h.jpg)

I have been a big fan of the Lightning series from MSI back when the GTX 480 Lightning was released. Their Twin Frozr coolers helped achieve the massive overclocking potential of the cards, and after constantly tweaking and retweaking, I finally feel I've gotten a good idea what it's capable of. Here's an overview of the card and what you can expect should you buy one.

**Price** - The card comes in at $599 which is pretty steep for a 680, dual-bios,  backplate, voltage checkpoints and [MSI's unique GPU reactor.](http://imgur.com/Gt4yp) Standard fare is 2GB of VRAM, and a slightly higher than usual factory overclock of 1110 Mhz that boostclocks to 1167. 


**Cooler &amp; Temps** - MSI's Twin Frozr IV cooler is hands down one of the best I've even seen. Dual 100mm fans keeps this card cool, it idles at 28c, with the fan running at 30%. Quiet and cool. Further, its startup fan reversal helps prevent dust from accumulating in the heatsink, though I'll see how effective this truly is in time. When it does this, the fans run in reverse at 100% for 30 seconds on startup, which gets pretty loud. Under load while gaming(not stress testing or benchmarking) I never saw the 680 Lightning exceed 58 celsius. In Battlefield 3, it leveled off at 68c with the fans manually locked in at 60%. The fans were inaudible at 58% and lower


**Overclocking &amp; Voltage** - The Lightning take two 8 pin PCI Express power connectors. The biggest trick up the 680 Lightning's sleeve is its ability to deliver more voltage than every other 680 with exception of the EVGA's 680 Classified with EVbot. With the 3 voltage checkpoints, and PLL voltage with a multimeter. From factory the Lightning kicks out a maximum of 1.212v bypassing the nVidia cap of 1.175. This is achieved via the secondary LN2 BIOS. The primary intent of this BIOS is to allow for liquid nitrogen cooling, however is it is also designed for high overclocking on air/water, and as such provides a number of benefits:


* Increases voltage cap

* Removes auto underclocking when card reaches 70c

* Removes software and hardware safeguards for stabile high overclocking

* Removes -0c errors when LN2 cooling.


With the LN2 BIOS I was able to achieve a boostclock of 1305 Mhz. I believe I can get higher. Other users were able to achieve peak boostclock of 1375Mhz. I also found that overclocks that were achievable in the original BIOS were more stable in the LN2 BIOS. MSI has announced that Afterburner 2.2.3 will allow the Lightning to surpass the 1.212v cap which should allow for an even higher boostclock. At the time of this review


[The GPU reactor] (http://i.imgur.com/kJ0Ynh.jpg) fits on the back of the card and is supposed to reduce voltage ripple while increasing the overclocking headroom. Personally


[Without cover](http://i.imgur.com/Tepg4h.jpg)

[Without reactor board](http://i.imgur.com/bdO03h.jpg)

**Benchmarks** -  I conducted benchmarks with and without 1305 Mhz overclock due to the fluctuating binning on the Lightnings. Not everyone will be able to achieve 1300+ Mhz. 

[Benchmark graphs]( http://imgur.com/3iO6T)


&gt;Settings

Battlefield 3  - 1920x1080/Ultra settings/ 4x MSAA/ Motion blur off

Batman Arkham City - 1920x1080/Details: Very High/8x MSAA/Tessellation: High

Metro 2033 - 1920x1080/Very High Quality/4x MSAA/DOF off

&gt;All testing was conducted with 304.79 drivers

**Conclusion** - I've always been a sucker for the Lightning series so it comes as no surprise that I feel the 680 Lightning is the best one yet. It runs fantastically cool, then this card has the ability to smash everything in its path.  [Xoleras on Overclock.net was able to get over 24000 SLI GPU score in 3DMark11.]( http://3dmark.com/3dm11/3772300) 
If you want absolutely the best in synthetic benchmarks, quiet, and stable, the GTX 680 Lightning is hands down a great choice. If however, budget is on your top list of priorities, I cannot recommend the 680 Lightning. It is designed for the extreme overclocker in mind, not to be light on your wallet.

**Tl;DR The GTX680 Lightning from MSI is one powerhouse of a card that can produce stunning results but most of its features are too costly for the standard user.**

The mod wasnt too hard at all. The longest part was making sure all the measurements i did were correct. Cutting the case was done with a dremel with a ez-lock cutting circle. Of course the screws that came with the rads were unusable to top mount the 360. Had to purchase some 30mm screws. 
*****
The EK 280 rad barely fits into place. There is absolutely no clearance between the bottom of the cdrom trays and the top of the rad. I have it secured by screwing through the original cases vertical support panels directly in front of the rad. Doing this allowed me to keep the 2 front original 140mm fans and run a push/pull setup on them.
******
Had to go with a low profile rad in the top of the case due to clearance issues with the ram slots. I could have shifted the rad closer to the side but then it wouldnt look good with an off center rad grill up top. I currently run the 120mm pwm fans at 40% to keep them silent. Once my cpu temps reaches 40 degrees under load the fans crank up to compensate. Idle temps are bit higher due to this but it is worth it in my opinion.
******
The tubing looks red in the pictures due to the flash. In person they are very close to the same color as the fans.

*****

Currently overclocked to 4.5ghz@ 1.315 Vcore on a 2500k cpu. Idle temps are around 30-33 celsius. GPU temps idle at 25 C. With GPU and CPU load at 100% running prime95 blend and msi kombuster temps reach 50 celsius(cpu) and 33(gpu). Ambient air temp is 22 C.

Alright

______________

**PEG power connectors**

As was explained in the previous post there is a current limit **per wire** for any leads running from the power supply to the mainboard or other devices. This is the reason that some graphics cards have a single 6 pin power connection

The difference between the 6 pin and 8 pin power connectors is easy but also important:

* A 6 pin PEG connector can deliver 75W of 12V power to the graphics card.

* An 8 pin PEG connector can deliver 150W of 12V power to the graphics card.

* There is a [6+2 pin PEG](http://www.playtool.com/pages/psuconnectors/pcie6plus2index.jpg) hybrid connector as well. Since this allows you to plug it into an 8-pin socket that cable should be able to deliver 150W

Additionally

____________________

**6+2 pin fairytales**

Remember

_________________

Knowing what power connectors are on your graphics card makes it easy to determine what kind of Wattage your PSU must be able to deliver to the graphics card alone:

* A GTX 560 with dual 6 pin connectors is allowed to draw a theoretical maximum of 75W (slot) + 75W (6-pin) + 75W (6-pin) = 225W from the power supply. This means you have to allocate 225W for the graphics card alone

* A GTX 580 which has one 6 pin and one 8 pin PEG connector can thus draw a theoretical maximum of 75W (slot) + 75W (6-pin) + 150W (8-pin) = 300W from the power supply. A quick look at the [GTX 580 specifications]( http://www.geforce.com/Hardware/GPUs/geforce-gtx-580/specifications) shows that in reality the GTX 580 draws a maximum of 244W total so this is again well within the allotted 300W.

____________

**Custom cards vs. reference cards**

Various graphics card designers have boards of their own design as well as factory overclocked GPUs on these boards. The power your graphics card consumes can therefore differ from the reference power requirements that are mentioned in the examples. The specificied Wattage of the slot

__________

**Native PEG connectors**

If a power supply natively supplies the correct power connections for a graphics card, some harddisks, fans, lighting, etc.), added the theoretical maximum of 300W for my dual GTX 560s adding up to a total of 600W. 

___________

**Reality check**

My power supply is a Corsair HX650 which is rated to deliver 650W **continuously** up to an ambient temperature of 50C. Measurements during gaming showed it pulled 522W peak from the wall socket. Taking into account the 80% efficiency of my PSU that means the components were actually drawing just 522W * 0.80 = 418W. All in all my system is balanced: it's well within the theoretical maximum power draw and gaming usage still leaves a margin of a pretty massive 650 - 418 = 232W!

________________

**Don't gamble!**

Taking a 300W baseline usage is probably enough for most systems out there although for an overclocked 8-core Bulldozer system you'll probably want to take a considerably higher margin. Be aware though that even these power-hungry systems are only power-hungry if you stress them to full load. Normal webbrowsing

Don't start calculating just yet though

___________

**Modular vs. non-modular**

A lot of us are concerned with cable management when building a PC. Modular power supplies make for a cleaner looking inside of your computer case and many make the argument for improved airflow. While both are certainly worth consideration

If you have the choice within your budget between a high quality non-modular versus a lesser quality modular, you can simply route the cables you are not using behind the motherboard tray and they disappear out of sight after only about 3 or 4 inches. 

This does not impede airflow whatsoever and is almost equally clean looking. When it comes to cable management the case is the deciding factor every time!

___________

**Cable length**

An often overlooked property that is also more important than modular is the length of the cables. If the cables running from your PSU are too short it's going to be impossible to route them in such a way that you end up with a clean look

Additionally

_____________

**Available connectors**

Much more important than the modular vs. non-modular debate is the availability of certain power connectors on your PSU

Your motherboard connector is obviously going to be there. This will either be a [24-pin connector](http://www.playtool.com/pages/psuconnectors/main24index.jpg) or a [20+4 connector](http://www.playtool.com/pages/psuconnectors/main20plus4index.jpg). If you are using a really old motherboard you'd need the 20+4 but in most cases either will do just fine.  Expensive power supplies tend to have the 20+4 so they can cater to any eventuality. On to the other variables:

* Main board CPU power. This connector routes additional 12 volt power to your mainboard. Your mainboard will have either a 4-pin ATX12V power socket or  an 8-pin EPS12V socket. Cheaper and older power supplies tend to have the [4-pin ATX12V connector](http://www.playtool.com/pages/psuconnectors/12v4pinindex.jpg)

* The well-known [SATA power connectors](http://www.playtool.com/pages/psuconnectors/sataindex.jpg) and [Molex power connectors]( http://www.playtool.com/pages/psuconnectors/peripheralindex.jpg). For the most part, **they are allowed to require this**.

* [6 pin PCI express graphics power connectors (PEG)](http://www.playtool.com/pages/psuconnectors/pcie6index.jpg), running out of space in this post!).

**To be continued in part 3: PCI express power requirements.**

_________________________________________________________

Okay
There's lots of tests floating around
___________________________________________________________

**Bandwidth**

Everybody here has probably heard the magic word 'bandwidth' on a lot of occasions. As a computer and software engineer I've seen it used and most of the time also abused
What is bandwidth exactly? To put it simply it's the amount of **traffic per second** that a connection between 2 components can sustain. The simplest analogy would be to a highway. The amount of cars that can travel over the highway in a specified amount of time depends on 2 things:

* The maximum speed the cars are allowed to travel and;

* The number of lanes the highway provides.

Also take note of the fact that on a highway there's lanes in both directions. For the purpose of this discussion we'll consider a highway with one lane in either direction (2 total) to be a 1-lane connection because we're concerned with the maximum traffic per second from point A to point B. We can't exactly use the other lane to get there as those who tried can no longer tell you ;-)

A PCI slot is basically exactly the same: 

* x16 means that there are 16 traffic lanes running to the graphics card. Coincidentally in PCI express terms these are also called lanes! A single PCI express lane consists of an upstream (toward the graphics card) and a downstream connection. Both are equally fast but the only one that really needs to be is the one that's running toward the graphics card; most of the data that's exchanced between the graphics cards flows toward the card. (Not when you're using the GPU for other things than graphics but this is a gaming subreddit so we'll leave that out for clarity.)

* x8 as you'll have surmised by now means that there are 8 traffic lanes flowing toward the graphics card.

The maximum speed traffic can possibly flow over one of these lanes is determined by the PCI express version number:

* PCI express 1.0 has a speed of 250 MB (Mega **Bytes**) per second (= 0.25 GB/s).

* PCI express 2.0 has a speed of 500 MB/s (= 0.5 GB/s)

* PCI express 3.0 has a speed of 1000 MB/s (= 1GB/s)

This is one of the reasons that test results vary so much between different tests although it's not the only reason by a longshot. It is the cause however for some differences:

* A  single 16 lane PCI express 1.0 graphics card can receive 4GB/s of data

* A single 8 lane PCI express 2.0 graphics card can receive...... 4GB/s of data!

So when PCI express 2.0 arrived

________________________________________________________________

There are **important other factors** in play that determine whether you need (or would want) a 16 lane connection to your graphics card:

* The size of the 3D worlds in a particular game

* The size of your videomemory (per card)

I recently saw a review posted in /r/buildapc that made a comparison with dual GTX 580 cards in a x16 / x16 setup vs. a x8 / x8 setup.

The **stupidity** of this test prompted me to address the PCI express issue today rather than tomorrow (it was planned for tomorrow). [Here is the post I'm referring to so you can check it out.]( http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/kmwdo/difference_between_x16_and_x8_for_sli_explained/)

There are a couple of things wrong with this test:

The test is done with 3DMark 11. The worlds that are rendered in this benchmark easily fit in to the memory of a GTX 580. This means that once the data is transferred to the graphics card it can render a million frames with it without having to do massive amounts of data transfer from the main memory to the graphics card. This uses the x8 (or x16) link only once for a million frames. **3D worlds in upcoming games are much larger and require transfers of data while rendering a frame!**

**In other words

*This is by no means the end of this story but given the post mentioned above I decided to push out the first part ahead of time. Part 4 of the series will follow shortly

With these programs you can simply let your PC run programs in the background when you aren't playing games. With a high powered PC you are able to really contribute to these systems.

I've been running Folding@home for the last two years and started Boinc a few weeks ago when I got my Nvidia 680. What I want you to take away from this post is get involved and download one or more of these systems.

 **The Setup:**  

 * CPU: i5 2500k @ 4.8 GHz
 * GPU: GTX 580 @ 931 Core
 * GPU2: GT 520 @ stock
 * MEMORY: 2 DDR3 1.5v DIMMs @ 1600MHz
 * SOUND: Asus Xonar STX PCI-E x1
 * FANS: 7x AeroCool Shark 120mm 12v (~3A each) at full blast
 * WATER PUMP: Swiftech MP-655 12v (not sure of the amperage)
 * PSU: Corsair HX 850  

 **The Test:**  
Prime95 Blend test, made sure both GPUs were at 100% (or at least flickering between 98-100). Foobar2000 blasting tunes through the sound card (with onboard headphone amp, requires additional +12V +5V molex).  

 **The Results:**
Let everything run for 5 minutes and observed the wattage (1 Hz refresh).  The maximum wattage observed was 451 watts. Four hundred and fifty one, but I think this result speaks volumes in terms of what the general consensus is.  


As a humorous side note, and after giving him an overview of my system he said (and I quote) ""Hah, probably gonna be at least 1200W."" Even after I told him I was using an 850W PSU.... Anyways, hope this was helpful!

Overclocking Basics - Part 10: Overclocking the reference clock (hands-on)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Remember: overclocking / overvolting can damage system components and may limit or even void your warranty. Proceed at your own risk!**

**Intel users**

_____________________________________________________________

Since overclocking newer intel CPUs using the reference clock is severely limited at best and I don't have access to a 1366 system

**Software!**

_____________________________________________________________

As promised earlier

* [**OverCalc v1.4**](http://www.filefactory.com/file/cd63660/n/OverCalc_v1.4.exe) (should be working now!)

* [New Online scan](http://www.virustotal.com/file-scan/report.html?id=685e2acaabd6cabce6027b82e01a993a4e188a0298da8cb51078258cc51cbc13-1314948278).

* OverCalc requires Microsoft.NET 4.0 to run. You can download the latest version at Microsoft here: [.NET 4.0](http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?id=17851)

This program will calculate the resulting clocks when you change the reference clock or any of the multipliers. It will also attempt to calculate appropriate timings for your RAM.

This program does not change any system settings

**First off: enter your factory RAM timings**

_____________________________________________________________

To get started you need to fill out your RAM's factory specifications in the top right corner. In the dropdown box you can select the datarate of the RAM that is in your system (DDR3 1333 / 1600 / 1866 / 2000 / 2133). Under the dropdown box you can specify your RAM's timings. They are organized in the usual way: CAS- tRCD - tRP - tRAS (e.g. 9-9-9-24). Once you have specified what RAM is in your system

As you may remember from the previous articles

The result of this calculation appear to the right of the CAS setting

The same calculations are done for tTCD

**Secondly

_____________________________________________________________

Now that the program knows your factory RAM timings

Keep in mind that we can get good results by actually lowering some or all of the multipliers!

As an example I will tune down the DRAM multiplier (in the left groupbox

As I get to a value of 214MHz we now see something interesting happening in the bottom grid that is filled with possible timings. As a reference

The fields that are highlighted green are timings that should work with your base clock and DRAM multiplier (*should* means decent chance here

Also bear in mind that even though it **appears** we are using slower timings on the RAM

Values that are faster than specification but only slightly are marked yellow. So with this DRAM multiplier (1333) and a reference clock of 214MHz we can basically try 2 timing settings for the memory: 9-9-9-22 (using only the green values) or 8-8-8-22 (using the faster yellow values where available).

If values are further out of spec (too fast) they are displayed in red, but interesting to see how the values play out).

You will also notice that when you up the reference clock that obviously your processor and HT link speeds will go up considerably.

If I increase the reference clock even further

Now my RAM is totally back at it's reference speed (800MHz DDR3 1600) while the multiplier is set at the value for DDR3-1333. My processor is now obviously clocked higher than before and so is the HT link speed (now 2400MHz). This might be too fast for the HT link

If we want to take things further

The RAM is now running at nearly 1800 data rate with the multiplier set only to 1333. We now have viable timing options for 10-10-10-27 (yellow) or 11-11-11-27 (green). Realistically this is a steep overclock for memory but then again

I also notice now that my processor speed is way over 4GHz (4272MHz) so I might want to turn that down a tad. Turning down the CPU multiplier to x14.5 brings it down to a more realistic 3.87GHz. The HT multiplier is once again over the 2.4GHz mark so I tune that down a tad as well. Setting the HT to x8 brings it to 2136MHz

As you can see from the examples in the text above

If you look back at the design schematics for AMD systems that were discussed in the previous posts you'll notice that data transfers from the main memory to the video memory involve both the HT link speed and the memory speed so if these final settings happen to be stable we'll see a performance gain there.

**Stability testing and temperatures**

_____________________________________________________________

Since we now obviously have other stuff besides the processor overclocked

Other than that

I don't personally like going to the very extremes of what is still stable

**Questions

Topics that get mentioned a lot here (and I don't like other guides):

- Watercooling radiators in-depth. What are the differences

- Intel RST. Setting up SSD caching with Intel's high-end controller hubs.

This is limited to what I have hardware on hand to do and what I think is decently covered elsewhere.

Hey everybody

One of our valued contributors has generously offered to sponsor a game giveaway contest!

Since the subreddit is built around (among other things) the love for being different and original in building / designing you dream rig and making it your own unique creation

To qualify

* Pictures of your rig (including a note with your reddit name in the picture)
* The specifications

It doesn't have to be an expensive rig. I know we discuss a lot of high-end gear but the aim for this contest is to be original. Being different doesn't have to cost a lot of money.

We've decided to pick the winner at random because picking the winner on karma led to karma-wars that spoiled the fun for a lot of contestants and led to unfair practices.

May the person with the best real-life karma win! The prize: a game of your choosing from a list we've compiled (because ""within reason"" requires being reasonable and judging by the voting behavior

We still love seeing your original builds and we'll be doing random draws from now on in future contests :-)

Obviously this is still rumor and by no means guaranteed to be accurate but combining all the sources this is my personal take on what it will probably look like.

Prices are based on the relative performance estimate compared to the current 6 series lineup. The new GCN architecture based cards will very likely come at an additional premium which I tried to estimate based on market value and enthusiast level pricing.

Overclocking Basics - Part 9: Overclocking the reference clock (or base clock)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Remember: overclocking / overvolting can damage system components. Proceed at your own risk!**

**Intel users**

Before you start reading it's worth noting that overclocking by using the base clock is nearly impossible on Sandy Bridge systems. Because modern AMD systems still offer an advantage through the base clock I will be discussing AMD only in this article. The article does explain why though

**Components affected by the base clock **

In case you did not yet know the basic components on your motherboard and how they interconnect, on Sandy Bridge it defaults to 100MHz.

In older systems all components derived their clockrates from this base clock through the use of what we call clock multipliers and clock dividers 

**Classic architecture**

As you can see in the schematic linked above the basic components are:

* The CPU

* The Northbridge chip

* The Southbridge chip, network and other stuff where speed is less critical. The connection between the Southbridge chip and the Northbridge chip also goes by different names:  A-link express (AMD) and DMI (Direct Media Interface; Intel).

* Memory and PCI express bus. The rest is of little interest in overclocking so I won't discuss them in this article.

**Recent differences in architecture**

A couple of changes have been made to the basic architecture described in the schematic above. Some changes were recent

* On AMD systems the memory controller now resides on the CPU. This means that the memory now connects directly to the CPU as opposed to being connected through the Northbridge chip. The CPU on AMD systems connects to the Northbridge chip via an interface called the HT link (HT stands for HyperTransport). The PCI express lanes still run from the Northbridge chip. This is why different chipsets on AMD systems can offer a different total number of PCI express lanes. The more lanes the more PCI express slots a mainboard can support.

* On some Intel systems (X58 chipset

* On Intel Sandy Bridge systems there is no more Northbridge chip. This means that besides the memory the PCI express lanes also connect directly to the CPU. There is still a Southbridge chip that is now also directly connected to the CPU via the DMI interface described earlier.

**Why is this important?**

The architecture changes are important because it changes the way that changes to the reference clock affect your system (any base clock change obviously also affects the CPU):

* On Sandy Bridge any change to the reference clock will change the PCI express clock. This is why an increase of as little as 3MHz will often lead to instability across the board. This more or less disqualifies Sandy Bridge from this form of overclocking. The base clock also affects other components but since we're stuck with the PCI express limits this doesn't do us any good.

* On LGA 1366 systems changes to the base clock will affect the memory clock

* On AMD systems changes to the base clock affect the memory clock and the speed of the HT link between the CPU and Northbridge chip.

**Changing the base clock (AMD from here on down)**

Changing the base clock is a little more involved than simply changing the CPU multiplier because we have to consider all the other clocks that depend on it's speed. Consider this system example:

* Base clock is set at 200MHz (default)

* CPU clock is set at 3GHz through a multiplier of 15

* Memory clock is 800MHz (DDR3-1600). This basically means that the memory multiplier is set at 4 (it's not called a multiplier in most BIOSes but it really is just that).

* The HT link speed is 2000MHz through a multiplier of 10.

What happens when we up the base clock to 211MHz is this:

* CPU now runs at 3165MHz (3.165GHz) as 15 x 211 = 3165

* Memory now runs at 844MHz as 4 x 211 = 844. You could call this DDR3-1688 (DDR = Dual Data Rate so the 'effective clock' is 2 x 844 = 1688).

* The HT link speed is now 2110 MHz as 10 x 211 = 2110
While the CPU will probably run just fine at 3165MHz the memory might not. The HT link speed will probably be okay also but it might not be. Here is where the fun starts:

* Your memory might run fine if you alter the settings for your memory timings (remember the first articles about latency and timings?)

* Your HT link will be fine if you set it's multiplier from 10 to 9. It will then run at 9 x 211 = 1899MHz.
The trick when playing with the base clock is trying to find settings that will please all 3 components (CPU

*Since the article is getting quite long and it's getting a bit late (3.26 AM in Europe) I'll continue this in the next post.*

As part of an upcoming build I've been looking into getting a new desk/chair setup and am seriously considering getting something that supports both standard keyboard mouse gaming as well as hard mounting of wheel/pedals. Now I could just stick to my current Ikea something-a-rather desk which I don't like. But screw that

The best looking reasonably priced setup I can find is the [Obutto R3volution](http://www.mainperformancepc.com/product/obutto-gaming-cockpits/obutto-r3volution-gaming-cockpit) which is a decent looking piece of kit (~900USD shipped). They also make a cheaper setup called the [Ozone](http://www.mainperformancepc.com/product/gaming-sim-cockpits/obutto-ozone-gaming-cockpit/) (~450USD Shipped) but the wheel and pedal mounts on that look average. Both have a tray for K/M and both come with monitor stands.

Anyone here own or have used either of the above Obutto's or any other kind of cockpit setup?

1315261678.0,k5rr1,[Article] Comparing and choosing videocards (in-depth),Markus_Antonius,28,2,29,"**Comparing and choosing videocards (in-depth)**
___________________________________________________________

Since I frequently see questions here and on other subreddits about choosing a videocard or comparing 2 or more videocards I decided to write a short article outlining what to look for.  Also

**AMD or NVidia**

___________________________________________________________

Choosing to go with AMD or NVidia is more or less a question of personal preference these days. Both offer similar price / performance ratios. They have to because reviewers will call them out on it almost instantly if they don't. To get rid of a myth while we're at it

**SLI or CrossfireX**

___________________________________________________________

 The only reason to consider your mainboard is if you want to use 2 or more videocards in an AMD CrossfireX or NVidia SLI configuration. Not all mainboards support CrossfireX and not all of them support SLI. The other aspect where your mainboard comes in to play is the number of graphics card slots a mainboard has and at what PCI express speeds they can run. The word 'speed' is not really the correct word though. PCI express x8 means that there are 8 'lanes' running from your chipset (AMD) or processor (Sandy Bridge) to a specific slot. PCI express x16 means that number of lanes is 16. 

Every solution with a single graphics card features 16 lanes on the primary graphics slot. Most solutions with 2 graphics cards have the ability to run 1 card at a 16 lane connection (x16) or 2 cards at an 8 lane connection each (x8 / x8). There are other configurations though

If you're buying a second card you'll ofcourse need to make sure that both cards support either CrossfireX or SLI as well. Not all of them do. This gets even more important when you want more than 2 cards because not all cards support  three-way scaling (or more for that matter). I'm concentrating on single card configurations in this article because there's a lot to know about a single card before considering multiple cards and all the pitfalls that a multiple card configuration brings with it. If there's a lot of interest in multiple card setups I will write about that later.

**What determines performance**

___________________________________________________________

There are several characteristics of a graphics card that determine how fast it will be. We're considering midrange graphics cards and faster that feature GDDR5 memory only:

* GPU clock speed. Like in the rest of your PC

* Number of stream processors. These are also called 'shaders' (generic name) or in case of current NVidia architecture 'Cuda cores'. This is the first reason clockspeed is not as important as most people think. 200 shaders running at 600MHz clock will be faster than 100 shaders running at a 1000MHz clock! Shader processor design is significantly different between NVidia and AMD GPUs so the shader count can't be directly compared between these different brands. NVidia shader cores number fewer but run at twice the GPU frequency. Shaders can be compared between the same brand but keep in mind that shader design can evolve between generations of cards of the same brand. In general though

* Memory frequency. Like the GPU frequency

* Memory bus width. Nearly all current graphics card memory run at around the same frequency of 1000MHz. GDDR5 is what they call 'quad pumped' meaning that the data rate of this memory is around 4000MHz. The memory bus width determines how many bytes of memory can be read simulteneously in one such a cycle. A single chip of memory on your videocard usually holds 128Mb of data that can be read at a rate of 64 bits (= 8 bytes) per cycle. Those 64 bits are what we call a bus width of 64. The graphics processor reads from multiple chips simultaneously giving the GPU a memory bus width of a multiple of 64. There are graphics cards with memory bus widths of 64 bits, 256 bits, 320 bits and even 384 bits. Making the bus width larger thus requires more memory chips of 64 bits each. This is the reason that some graphics cards with more memory are faster. Not because of the **amount** of memory that is on the card but because of the **bus width** that can be achieved with more physical memory chips. A 1 GB card with a 256 bit bus won't be faster than a 2GB card with a 256 bit bus! But a graphics card with 4000MHz memory and a 256 bit bus will be faster than a card with 4400MHz memory and a 192 bit bus because the 64 extra bits in the memory bus of the first card would make it comparable to a 192 bit bus with 5333MHz speed!

**Memory bandwidth**

___________________________________________________________

The memory frequency together with the memory bus width can be used to calculate the memory bandwidth of a videocard. Let's consider 2 videocards:

* GTX 460 1GB has a stock memory frequency of 900MHz and a 256 bit wide memory bus. GDDR5 has a datarate of 4 times the frequency: 4 x 900 = 3600MHz. A 256 bit memory bus equals 256 / 8 = 32 bytes of data per memory transaction at 3600 million transactions per second. 3600 million x 32 = 115200 million bytes per second. To go from megabytes per second to gigabytes per second we need to divide this number by 1 billion. The memory bandwidth of a GTX460 1GB is thus 115.2 GB/S. If you look up the specs at GeForce.com you'll see that this is exactly right.

* GTX 460 768Mb has the same memory frequency but only a 192 bit memory bus. So for the 768Mb version we get 192 / 8 = 24 bytes per memory transaction. 24*3600 = 86400

**Why to calculate the bandwidth yourself**

___________________________________________________________

The reason to calculate these yourself is twofold. For one

A more compelling reason to do the calculation yourself is that there are 2 different numbers that are referred to as a Gigabyte. For computer engineers working with binary numbers,741,824 bytes. However for a marketing executive a Gigabyte is 10^9 = 1,000,000,000 bytes. If we would have subsituted the engineering number in the calculations above it would account for an 8GB/S difference on the GTX 460 1GB. Not exactly small change. Since it is impossible to know beforehand which number a graphics card vendor uses for calculating the bandwidth the only way to get numbers that can be compared is to do the calculations yourself!

More information about these discrepancies can be found [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gigabyte#Consumer_confusion) on Wikipedia.

**In short**

___________________________________________________________

To recap the above

* The shader clock (same as the GPU clock in AMD Radeon but twice the GPU clock in NVidia 400 and 500 series)

* The number of shaders (also called stream processors or cuda cores) the count of which cannot be compared across AMD / NVidia platforms

* The memory bandwidth determined by the memory data rate multiplied by the memory bus width.

And as a bonus we've learned that more memory only results in more speed if it is configured in such a way that it results in a higher bus width and so a higher memory bandwidth. That you need more memory for higher than 1920x1200 resolutions is also a myth. You can check [this test at Hard|OCP]( http://www.hardocp.com/article/2011/02/24/amd_radeon_hd_6950_1gb_performance_review/3) if you need confirmation. A fully rendered frame of 2560x1600 takes up 11.7 megabytes of video memory. That is **less than 1%** of the total memory available on a 1GB videocard!!! 

The memory on a videocard is mostly used to hold textures that are wrapped around the 3d objects in a game. So more memory will start to matter when maps get bigger with more diverse graphics. For current games however the difference is mostly nonexistent!

While more memory bandwidth is a good performance indicator it is important to note that the GPU also needs to have an adequate number of stream processors working in parallel to actually make use of this extra bandwidth. That's why lower end card usually feature less bandwidth as well as less stream processors. It's also important to know that more memory bandwidth requires a more expensive circuit board design because it becomes increasingly difficult to route the higher number of connections required between the GPU and the memory chips. This is one of the reasons that ultra high-end videocards feature 2 GPUs that both have their own discrete memory (HD 6990 and GTX 590).

Overclocking Basics - Part 8: Steps for overclocking the CPU (unlocked)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Remember: overclocking / overvolting can damage system components. Proceed at your own risk!**

**Unlocked multiplier **

Since this is still 'Basics' we're going to concern ourselves with CPUs that have an unlocked multiplier for now. CPUs with a locked multiplier require additional knowledge which we will get to once we move on to the more advanced stuff. The advanced stuff will also be interesting to those with an unlocked multiplier CPU because it allows for more fine tuning of the CPU as well as getting extra performance from components other than the CPU.

**Turbo modes**

For CPUs with turbo modes I choose to disable the turbo mode and set the multiplier to the turbo setting as a default. Turbo modes are designed to increase the clock on part of the CPUs cores to increase the performance of single-threaded applications (as well as some multithreaded apps as it usually increases the frequency of more than one core). The reason for not increasing all cores to a higher setting is usually to limit the TDP so as to stay within the specified limits

**TDP and Temperature Delta**

TPD of a heatsink is not a static value. How much a heatsink is able to dissipate from your processor casing's surface depends on the ambient temperature (the surrounding temperature of the heatsink in your PC case). This is why case airflow is also important as is the room temperature of the room your computer is in. Keep this in mind when you form expectations of how your heatsink will perform. This is also the main reason heatsinks perform differently in different surroundings and PC cases. It's the most likely reason you are getting different temperatures than other overclockers (as opposed to the quality of the thermal paste you are using). 

Thermal paste performance is a myth for the most part. I'm not advocating the use of cheap thermal paste here

**Setting the multiplier initial value for a processor with a Turbo Mode**

This is easy

**Setting the multiplier initial value for a processor without a Turbo Mode**

Usually I start with upping the multiplier value by 2 before starting stability testing.

**The procedure**

As with the GPU it's really a simple iteration:

* Set the multiplier value to the desired level

* Do stability testing with both Prime95 and IntelBurnTest for 8 hours or until either programs detects an error. Stop the stability testing if the processor reaches 65 degrees Celsius. While this is an arbitrary number for the most part

* If errors were detected or temperatures get too high decrease the multiplier by 1 and start again from the testing phase.

* If no errors were detected and temperatures stayed within limits

* Once you are reasonably certain you have a stable overclock it's wise to run 2 more tests: a test for 24 hours with Prime95 and a test for 24 hours with IntelBurnTest. If this doesn't produce any errors you can be pretty sure you have a stable system!

Remember

Overclocking Basics - Part 6: Tools to test your videocard
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

**More reliable testing**

As was pointed out to me in the previous article's comments

The stress testing in the previous article was meant to be done by a few hours of gaming. This is also what most people consider to be the best test for stability. GPU stability testing tools do exist but oftentimes they are not really being maintained by the authors. Overclocking GPUs remains a bit of a niche and hobbyist domain. With all the factory overclockable cards that have hit the market recently though

**Tools for error checking**

Here are two tools for testing your GPU which scan for errors in the memory or rendering calculations:

* [OCCT v3.1.0](http://www.ocbase.com/perestroika_en/index.php?Download) (Overclock Checking Tool). This is a very nice looking tool that also produces interesting graphs of the temperatures

* [VMT v1.7]( http://mikelab.kiev.ua/PROGRAMS/vmt.zip) (Video Memory Stress Test) A tool for testing your video memory. The OCCT author states that he's not happy with the videomemory test in that application so I've put this up as a tool for additional testing. The site is in Russian so the link points to the file directly. If your Russian is better than mine
For stress testing an overclocked **C**PU there are even better tools than OCCT but I'll swing back around to the **C**PU after the weekend.

For both these applications 1 simple rule applies: if the stability test finds ***ANY*** errors your clocks are set to high and it would be wise to cut back on the overclock. The longer you run the tests the more sure you can be that things are running OK. Sometimes an error will present in a matter of minutes

**Request** If you know of any additional tools for stability testing a GPU and/or videoram

1336409140.0,tbdg7,"Some things to consider before buying a Surround setup, My personal pros and cons of the technology.",TheSnooter,32,3,http://www.reddit.com/r/gamingpc/comments/tbdg7/some_things_to_consider_before_buying_a_surround/

Every so often there is a post asking whether or not Surround/Eyefinity is worth all the hype, remember these are problems **I MYSELF** am experiencing so everyone is going to have a different opinion and experience. 

I’ll start with the pros first because when Surround works

* Brand new games that are built with Surround support are really great

* WoW is also pretty fun to play like this but if you were going to pay seriously you would need to do some serious UI tweaks to get everything on your main screen. Not a big deal since most people play with addons anyway but worth mentioning. 

* Dead Space is where I have been having the most fun lately. Both 1 and 2 were on sale for 5 bucks each on steam last week so I grabbed them. Playing dead space in a dark room


With the good out of the way I’ll get into the cons. I’ll say right off the bat that most of these issues I am having is probably some kind of driver issue or because surround doesn’t work well with non-gaming programs but it’s annoying and jarring nonetheless. 

* Nvidia adverties the GTX 680 as being able to handle 3 monitors for surround and, whereas AMD has offered single card Eyefinity support for some time now. When setting up surround on with my 2 680s the screen told me I had to have 2 monitors plugged into GPU 1 and 1 monitor in GPU 2. Ok not a big deal I thought at the time, a little weird to me but whatever. This really isn’t a con until later on down the road. 

* Google Chrome was one of the first programs I opened after setting up surround and I immediately noticed something weird. There is a border all around the window as if it isn’t full screened

* Along the same I have yet to find a way to keep Netflix maximized on one screen while doing anything else on another. I have turned off surround and just had the multiple monitors on at once and could full screen Netflix and still do whatever on the other screens. Once again it is probably some kind of weird issue with how Surround treats all three screens as one but I can’t figure out how to fix it if there is one. 

* By far the worst of all these inconveniences is the issues that arise when trying to play many older

In all honesty some issues with older games should be expected but I didn’t think there would be this many issues simply trying to play on a single screen. What I mean is an example like these. 

* I tried to load up Bastion but the game would not visually appear on any screen. I could hear the title screen music but all my screens were black. I eventually figured out how to auto launch the game in windowed mode via steam but

* Dawn of War 2 will constantly crash on a single screen resolution and


* Probably my most infuriating game to date is Crysis. I bought the extreme edition on sale from Amazon and really wanted to see how my PC stood up to this game. Even though its 5 years old it is still one of the most demanding games so like any aspiring enthusiast I wanted to see how my rig held up. Long story short: even though this game launch fine in a single screen display and had a single screen res
The last little weird thing I’ve noticed is when some games have Surround support but are just being played on a single monitor are alt tabbed they automatically switch to windowed mode. Crysis 2 does this a bunch. 

This is pretty much why I wish you could have all the monitors hooked up to GPU one with surround on. That way I could just surround on and off while still activating SLI on all 3 monitors. TBH I’m not sure how/If this would work as a solution I have not had time to fiddle around with switching back and forth.I really need to play around with plugging in my monitors to try and optimize it in a way where I can switch back and forth without hassle but I doubt I’ll ever find a happy medium. 

I know it sounds like I am bashing Surround but when it comes down to it I do think this is a really neat technology. When it works it works really well and as I said before offers a gaming experience unique to PC. I just want others to be aware that for everyday use it’s a big PITA. I am sure over the years as drivers and software are optimized with the thought of multiple monitor displays a lot of these issues will go away

Soon I'll be adding another 7970

Now there's a couple of things I want to say about some of these parts.

First, but I'm going to fill that up soon enough. The only real bad things about this case are very minimal. It lacks good water cooling support, bigger PSUs will have trouble with space if you have the hard-drive cage placed like mine, and it doesn't have a 20 pin header for the front panel USB 3.0. Other than that, this case is awesome and I enjoyed wrestling with it.

The Rampage IV Extreme. This thing has a ton of features. More than I care to list at this time. If you can afford it, and I had to nitpick. It requires a ton of plugs. Normally it wouldn't be too much of a problem, but since I had minimal space to route cables behind the radiator and in between the PSU and HDD cage it was a VERY tight fit to get everything in. I fear that many PSUs will also lack the required amount of the correct cables to plug into it as well. That and the fan on the southbridge is absolutely the loudest thing in my rig. It's not a ""true"" EATX board either, it's only slightly larger and will fit most ATX size cases.

A few people seem to have some problems with OCZ's SSDs. Most of the bad blood was from firmware issues that caused crashes early in their life. However OCZ has updated firmware available that completely eliminates any problems. Other than that

The PSU is awesome. It came with a TON of cables and being fully modular there is a lot of flexibility. [Here's an unboxing album for those of you that would like to see it.](http://imgur.com/a/5MrFl) One of the nifty things about the hybrid series is that when there is low power draw the fan will actually shut off to stay quieter

The CPU is great

As for the 7970

Now on to the Raystorm kit. I absolutely love it. The pump is dead silent on the lower settings and still quiet on the highest setting. It pushes a huge amount of water as well. The only qualm I have with it

If there's anything else you would like to know just ask and I'll try and answer the best I can.",self,t5_2sq2y,True,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/gamingpc/comments/sizif/in_celebration_of_7k_subscribers_i_give_you_alice/

* Ran Memtest for over 12 hours and after 6 full passes
* Updated BIOS to latest firmware.
* Since updating BIOS firmware: 
* * SSD: benchmarks are all normal EXCEPT **4K Writes** which have improved but are still underperforming by about 33%.  This is definitely progress
* * Sleep issue:  Put computer to Sleep, and several minutes later, noticed Q-Code was at “AA” (remember, it used to remain at ""30"", which was the Sleep cycle).  This is the first time I’ve witnessed  the Motherboard report a normal Q-Code of “AA” after waking up from a Sleep.  Again, this is definitely progress.
* * Have been running Prime95 Torture Test for over 2 hours now after waking the computer up, with no errors so far.  During this time, I decided to push my computer to the limit, and also ran 3dMarks11 benchmark.  System did not crash, and got a 3DMarks score of P4385.  **How long should I run Prime95 for?**
* * CPU &amp; Fan Info after 2+ hours of Prime95:  http://i.imgur.com/UqSFG.png  (I have no idea how to read this
* Graphics Card:  **Can someone please confirm if a 3DMarks score of around *7200* is indeed low for my specs?**  I’m not yet clear on that

So it seems the BIOS firmware update has helped in at least a few areas, or at least pin-point the cause and get it exchanged.  Thanks again and I'll continue to answer all the posts and keep everyone updated until this is 100% resolved.

**Notes:**

* No major issues during build.
* All latest Drivers and Windows Updates have been installed

**Turning On First Time:**

First time I turned it on, worked OK (never had the green screen problem since).  Got CPU Fan errors.  Read on forum that’s normal for Noctua NH-D14 fan due to efficient RPM, so I lowered CPU Fan Alarm threshold and never got the CPU fan error again.

**Main Issues:**

* When it wakes up from from a short sleep, when I put it to sleeps, it goes from “AA”, to “03” (System Agent initialization before microcode loading), and then goes off.
* At first
* Now, Windows then appears normally on the screen.
* Computer has frozen at least four times so far.  Once when editing the Windows Hosts file in Notepad, fourth time while opening a Youtube video again.  I checked the Q-Code of the MB when the second freeze and fourth freeze happened and it showed a Q-Code of “30” on both occasions, so it might have to do with the Sleep.  When it freezes, the screen stays on whatever it was on, but nothing moves or reacts or changes (neither on the screen nor on the computer itself).  It simply stops responding and reacting.  When it froze on 3dMark11, the screen was just dark and stayed that way (I ran 3dMark 11 4 times, it only froze on one of those four times).

**Please help me figure out all these issues as I’m way in over my head and have no idea how to diagnose or resolve them.**

Building a PC was far more complicated than I anticipated (especially due to the poor instructions in the manuals regarding so many cables), I’m starting to have regrets and second-thoughts, especially since I saved up a lot of money to buy top-of-the-line components to avoid precisely these kinds of issues.  To be honest, after this experience, I probably won’t be building a PC ever again, but I want to at least salvage this one so that it lasts me at least 3 years.

**I’m willing to test, so I’m all ears.**

In the post yesterday about PCI express connections I already wrote that the story would continue

* What particular game you are running will determine how much the performance will benefit from a full x16/x16 connection. Large open world games will likely benefit more

* How much memory is available in the graphics cards will determine how much the PCI express connection will need to be used. The PCI express connection is likely to be of less importance if there is more than 1GB per card of videomemory.
It is important to remember that the PCI bus connection to your graphics card is primarily used to transfer data from your main memory to your graphics memory. This data we're talking about are the [textures]( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texture_mapping) and [meshes]( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polygon_mesh) that make up a scene in your 3D game environment. 

Please realize that both the textures and the meshes that make up a game world are bigger when you are playing on high settings. More detailed textures and meshes will thus run you out of video memory sooner. 

The rendering process itself is only dependent on the speed of the GPU and not on the speed of the PCI express link. **This is why running a benchmark to compare render speeds will tell you absolutely nothing about any x16 advantage over x8.**

The problem only shows when a scene doesn't completely fit in the video memory. When that happens the GPU will need new data halfway through the rendering process and will thus have to wait on that data to arrive over the PCI express bus. If it has to wait on data during every frame rendering a x8 link will cost dearly: if you consider a framerate of 60fps you'd have at least 120 data transfers per second. One transfer to each card and these have to wait for eachother to finish because only one card at a time can read from main memory!! This effectively means that with 2 cards it's even more important they run at x16 than with 1 card.
With dual x16 slots every wait would be cut in half. 

Truth be told for current games and with 1GB videocards this doesn't happen often. However games never stay 'current' for very long. Especially with the 4th quarter releases fast approaching. How much you will gain from x16 / x16 remains to be seen but the gain is going to be more than it is now.

To illustrate what I mean

Intel is going to include PCI express 3.0 support in Ivy Bridge. The main reason for going PCI express 3.0 is to double the bandwidth. The upcoming Radeon HD 7000 series will very likely also support PCI express 3.0. It always strikes me as odd that the people stating they don't need x16 / x16 are often the same people that are looking forward to Ivy Bridge and HD 7000. Upcoming PCI express 3.0 at x8 / x8 will be exactly as fast as PCI express 2.0 at x16 / x16 on current mainboards is.

If AMD (which currently has the only real x16 / x16 boards) is giving people something they don't need then why is Intel scrambling to make up for the difference in Ivy Bridge?

Edit: Intel X58 based boards (LGA 1366) also had the capacity for x16/x16 graphics (thanks icono). For AMD you'll need the FX chipsets if you want x16/x16 graphics.

Sandy Bridge currently only supports x8 / x8 PCI express graphics. At the moment this can only be solved by designing mainboards that have the NVidia NF200 chip. On these boards both cards talk to the NF200 at x16/x16 but the NF200 talks to the mainboard memory via a single PCI express x16 link. So while your cards register as x16/x16 on these boards in reality they are somewhere in between true x16/x16 and x8/x8.

**Closing thoughts**

* If intel didn't see the need for higher PCI express bandwidth coming they wouldn't put any effort towards including it in Ivy Bridge

* If consumers or gamers can never use more than 4 cores then why does Sandy Bridge E even have them? And before you scream 'video encoding' think about how many people you know that do video encoding vs the number of people you know that do gaming.

_______________________________________________

As a final remark

Having x8/x8 graphics cards is fine and having 1GB is fine too. I just hate that people state that it doesn't make a difference. The correct thing to say would be that it doesn't ***always*** make a difference.

Having no bottlenecks in your system is always a good thing as games tend to grow heavier on the CPU and GPU as they evolve in to bigger and better games. The same goes for multi-core systems. A system with 6 cores on half load will be more responsive than a system with 4 cores on full load. You don't need the 6 cores but saying that it doesn't make a difference is an opinion, read a book ;-)

/r/gamingpc is a community of people that love building their own custom gaming rigs and talking about the latest and greatest hardware that PC gaming has to offer. It was founded as a place where people are allowed to splurge on their hobby, we don't need to hear that we're spending too much money, we know this.

This is the place to build and share your own creation and to discuss newly released hardware. If you've never built a PC before you're welcome to lurk here and see what others are doing. If you want to learn how to build a computer you need to post in /r/buildapc. The same goes for upgrading it (questions like 'what videocard should I upgrade to' or 'will this max out Crysis 5').

In order to keep this place fun for the more advanced builders and gaming veterans we do not allow posting of technical comments or 'facts' unless you have a professional background in IT. There is a huge difference between citing a medical book and being a doctor. Computer architecture is no different. Also keep in mind that many hardware review websites are run by hobbyists. Don't quote their findings unless you have the background that allows you to explain these findings. The gaming world is full of myths regarding hardware and performance and we don't need the myths in here. Do feel free to share your own benchmarks and reviews on hardware that you own and play on yourself :-)

I am writing this here for a few simple reasons.

* a) I think this constitues as a high end build

* b) After weeks and months of lurking I trust you guys more than BaPC

* c) and lastly because after hearing my story I think you will understand my plight

TLDR at the bottom

For a ~~really~~ fairly short background I discovered r/BaPC a few months ago and read over all the guides
15. I say ""built"" because my cousin did most of the work but I watched with extreme interest and I always wanted to build again. After feeling confident that I had all the information I needed I started out pretty modest. The cookie cutter 2500k build
and reserved my GPU to the upcoming 7850s. I was just going to get one. After impatientely buying all of the parts sans the GPU I put my PC together and was hooked. I quickly upgraded my ram from ""you only need 8gb"" 
to 16gb just because
I am going to tell it anyway. I ordered two MSI 7870s the day they came out. A few days later I ordered two more Saphhire 7870s because I didnt know if I would like the MSI brand. I made a post about this on BaPC and
gamingpc but I claimed to only have one of each because it was stupid to buy the two(four) of them. So sitting in my room were 4 7870s just tempting me to open them
To wrap up this long and sad story I returned all 4 of my 7870s (sorry online vendor) and bought two EVGA 680s


* So on to my questions and point. Here I am sitting with a pretty sick rig but I feel like my 2500k is already 
holding me back. Thanks to psikeiro and his comparisons for PCIe 2.0 and 3.0 I feel like I need to have a 
SB-e CPU to unlock the full potential of my rig. Especially since I have two more Dell U2412Ms on the way. My questions are this.


* Will upgrading my Mobo and CPU cause a lot of problems on my SSD(OS drive). I have read some posts on how 
to make this a no hassle ordeal but I would still like more reassurance. For the CPU I plan on getting the i7-3930K


* For the Mobo I have chosen the [ASrock X79 Extreme7](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?
Item=N82E16813157284)


* Another thing that makes me apprehensive to buy this mobo is my current [16gb of ram](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16820231429) is not on the supported list. It is quad channel and by all means should work but I just don't know how seriosuly I should take the memory supported list. 


A bonus question is this

I know this may sound to some like whining or just being stupid but I feel like I can always make my PC better and hope at least some of you understand. I am paying the price literally and figurativly for not doing as
much  research as I should have and being hasty. I originally started with a budget of 1500 but I have well exceeded 3k and I think I can afford a little more.

Like I said at the begining I feel like this subreddit is an appropriate place for this kind of question but if not I will gladly take it down and post it to BaPC in 24 hours. 
To those of you who read my full story I thank you

TLDR

* How hard is it to upgrade from a Asrock extrem4 gen3 and 2500k to a SB-e and ASrock X79 extreme7. 

* What would upgrading entail? Could I keep all the info on my current SSD without much issue?

* Will this ram work in the extreme7 even though it isnt on the supported memory list. 

Edited for format

Edit: Thank you all for the sound advice and reassurance. I tried to respond to everyone and I want you to know I will take all advice and points into consideration. The overwhelming opinion is to hey why not try to keep your data but clean install is best. I will have to think on this some more. 

Also whether it is proper rediquette or not I went and upvoted everyone's comment because I felt like they were all helpful in their own way and I do appreciate the fact that you took time to respond at all. I will be sure yo keep you all updated on what I decide to do. ",self,t5_2sq2y,True,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/gamingpc/comments/s5f7n/i_want_to_upgrade_my_cookie_cutter_rig_to_a_true/

Now that we've touched on the subject of the CPU

DDR Memory
-------------

The current generation of memory that is used in PCs is DDR3 memory. DDR is an abbreviation of ""Double Data Rate"". The 3 in the name means that we're currently on the third generation of DDR memory.

Double Data Rate means that the speed on which DDR memory can be read is twice the clockspeed. In effect this means that DDR3-1600 runs on a clockspeed of 800MHz

Memory Timings
----------------

Aside from the clockspeed the memory is running on there is another major factor that determines memory performance: timings. You might have read specifications like ""DDR3 1600 CL9"" or ""DDR3 1600 9-9-9-25"" or something similar. The latter part of the memory specification are the timings. The most important memory timing is what is called the ""CAS Latency"". CAS is shorthand for ""Column Access Strobe"". We'll get back later to what this means exactly. The CAS Latency is the first number in a row of timings

Timings and Clockspeed
-----------------------

For memory timings there is a simple rule but with a caveat: the lower the timing value the faster the memory reacts to a read or write request from the processor or other components in your system. **However** memory timings are not measured in milliseconds or nanoseconds

As a consequence memory timings can only be directly compared if the clockspeed of both DIMMS is the same. A value of 9 for CAS Latency means that it takes 9 clockcycles before data can be read from a DIMM module from the time this data was requested until such time that the data is ready to be read. This is where clockspeed comes into play. In order to compare the memory reaction speed of memory that runs on different clockspeeds we need to know how long a clockcycle takes.

Let's consider 2 examples:

**1. DDR3 1600 CL9**

As stated earlier the clockspeed of DDR3 1600 is 800MHz. 800MHz means 800 Million clockcycles per second. 1 clockcycles thus takes 1 / 800

Now that we know how long a clockcycle takes we can calculate the real CAS Latency of our RAM in nanoseconds: CL9 in our case is 9 x 1.25 = 11.25 nanoseconds!

**2. DDR3 1333 CL7**

Now that we have calculated the CAS Latency for our DDR3 1600 CL9 we get to why CAS Latency can be so deceptive. DDR3 1333 runs at a clockspeed of 1333 / 2 = 666.5MHz. One clockcycle for this memory thus takes 1 / 666

So which RAM is fastest? You might be tempted to think that DDR3 1600 is faster than DDR3 1333 but this is not always the case! Every time the memory receives a read request for a specific memory location it takes the amount of time specified by the CAS Latency before actual data begins streaming from the DIMM module. In our example the 1333 memory does this significantly faster! Once a specific memory location is opened and data starts streaming

**The bottom line**

So again, not many applications will benefit from the 1600 speed. Most will benefit from the lower CAS Latency on the 1333 memory. How applications behave is notoriously difficult to predict however.

In any case, the higher the price will be :-)

**CPU Cache revisited**

Remember the previous article in which CPU cache size was mentioned? If not

In essence, the less your memory data rate will matter. However, every time the CPU cache needs to read from your main memory, chances are good that it will need to read from a new memory location. CAS Latency is thus as important as it ever was!

**The breakdown**

* CAS Latency is the most important factor in memory performance a lot of the time.
* Memory datarate is important but CPU cache is even more important!

This is one of the reasons this subreddit agrees with people buying a Core i7 over a Core i5: The Core i7 has 30% more CPU cache and will perform better than the i5, better die quality being one of them.


That's it for part 3 :-) Any questions / comments welcome!

Oh boy.... I'm gonna get my ass handed to me for posting this :-/ Nevertheless
With the storm of negativity surround the launch of the Bulldozer CPUs I thought it only fair to highlight some areas in which these processors will offer advantages. 

__________________________________________

**A short list:**

* The memory controller on the FX processors is better than the one on the Phenom II processors. While it doesn't outrun Sandy Bridge it's not bad at all.

* The memory controller on the FX processors offers support for ECC memory (thanks *lazor*).

* The FX processors support a new set of instructions that will significantly speed up some types of calculations. Modifying game engines to make use of these instructions when available is 
***significantly easier*** than modifying the engine architecture to use multiple cores.

* You don't have to overclock the FX CPU to get great performance in Battlefield 3 (talking 8120 and 8150 here for the most part)

* The FX processors sacrifice some floating point performance in favor of performance in other areas. A lot of benchmarks use floating point calculations to determine speed and while floating point performance used to be an indicator

* While using up a scary amount of power

* Most AMD 990X and 990FX based AM3+ boards offer very good value for money. Both are capable of both SLI and Crossfire and the 990FX supports dual x16/x16 graphics cards for an additional performance boost in games.

* 9 series chipsets offer IOMMU support (thanks again *lazor*)

__________________________________________

In the weeks preceding the Bulldozer launch I predicted the processors to have a better balance of performance where it's needed (for gaming). For the most part this turned out to be the case and - even though some of the figures were disappointing to me as well - I do think that as soon as prices drop a little particularly the FX 8120 is going to be a potentially very interesting choice in favor of either the X6 or the i5 processors.

Overclocking Basics - Part 5: Overclocking the video memory
--------------------------------------------------------------------

**The video memory revisited**

As mentioned in the previous article

Also

Also bear in mind that you are likely to hit a wall on the memory clocks far more quickly than you did with the GPU. In fact

There is something more going on there though: unlike the DDR3 that comprises your PC's main memory (remember Dual Data Rate?) GDDR5 actually pumps through 4 bits of data in one clockcycle as opposed to 2. In other words

**The bottom line (again)**

First off, sorry...) **Overclocking can damage your videocard and possibly other components. Proceed at your own risk!!**

The process I use for the videomemory is nearly identical to the GPU clock process:

* Start the temperature monitoring program and start watching the GPU temperatures again (yes, also there is no temperature sensor on the memory but it will likely crash before it gets too warm anyway).

* Start the benchmarking program (Furmark).

* Increase the clocks

* In Furmark, 8x MSAA Alti-aliasing, Dynamic Background  &amp; Dynamic camera. This will heat up your GPU considerably!!! Heed the warning that the program gives you and remember you can wreck your GPU if you push it too hard or if you have bad luck.

* With the settings done click [BURN-IN test]. It will start testing in windowed mode so you can keep an eye on your GPU temperatures. My GPU can go up to 100C according to NVidia specs but to be honest I don't feel comfortable with that much heat. Here's where gut-feeling comes in

* See how much your temperatures shoot up. If you start to feel uncomfortable with it

* If it appears stable you can stop the BURN-IN. I usually don't let it run longer than 2 minutes.

* **Extra step for stability testing inserted here! Before proceeding it's wise to at least check your GPU stability with OCCT. OCCT is discussed in [Part 6 here](http://www.reddit.com/r/gamingpc/comments/jonvr/article_overclocking_basics_part_6_tools_for/). If you want to be thorough (always a good idea) run a VMT memory test as well

* This time in FurMark

Repeat the above steps (increase memory clock

**At any time during BURN-IN or benchmark your computer may freeze!!! When it does

Once you have found your stable maximum clock setting

**If the game freezes or crashes

**One more warning

**Questions

 (c) 2011

**Edit:** *a good point was made in the comments that FurMark isn't the end-all be-all of stress testing. Though I disagree with the alternative choice of stress test in that comment it did push me to scour the web once more for some additional tools. I've found 2 that I will discuss in the next post!*

This was a small budget system I built in 2011 for school and moderate gaming. It still works fine with most games today

I'm running both GPUs in the computer right now at the lane speed of PCI-e 2.0 8x/8x. If and only if I remove one of the cards will the other run at 16x speeds. This is to be expected. I've searched for information regarding the use of a 660 on PCI-e 2.0 8x and it bottlenecking

The main reason I'm keeping the 560 in there is for PhysX

So the question becomes... Which configuration is better? :

1) 1x GPU - GTX 660 @ PCI-e 2.0 16x w/ auto-select PhysX

After much research into my parts

I was optimistic when I bought it

[Here is an album of the results of using the PC ICE coolant for 2 months.](http://imgur.com/a/iErzk) As a side note, pump and rads were fine.

I'm not saying that it is necessarily a bad coolant

I also want to warn you about the EK SPIN reservoir I had... I bought it because it looked cool. With the spinning wheel to show flow and such. Such a waste, and shoots out the top, back into the reservoir chamber.

The problem with this is bubbles. My pump (mcp35x) was so fast even at low speeds, the pump went to 100% and the problem was even worse.

I ended up replacing both the coolant and reservoir yesterday

Moral of the story is don't ignore the bad stuff you hear on forums

Parts if anyone wants a list:

Pump: MCP35x

Rads: Black Ice 240 GT stealth and XSPC EX120

Res: XSPC Dual 5.25""

**Fan Placement**  
While they were using a much older case and neglected to try out various other fan configurations, you're better cooling the GPU but at the cost of disrupting flow cooling the rest of the components.
  
  
**Fan Control**  
Some of you just run fans at 100% off the PSU, I'd prefer a solution that is as thoughless and automatic as possible in order to cut down on unnecessary noise, but this isn't always possible depending on number of fans and the motherboard involved. Thoughts?

I'm thinking of RMAing my GPU, including the fan curve just for testing's sake. For the past few weeks I've been getting random game crashes, both on graphically intensive games (ex. Far Cry 3) and not-so-intense games (ex. Chivalry: Medieval Warfare). Earlier I ran FC3 and it was going at 20FPS for some reason. I restarted the game and it was fine after that, but I'm worried. I haven't noticed any artifacting, but I do get game crashes, although it's not the display driver crashing, just the game itself. 

Also, which seems high to me. At load, I'm usually like 75-80C, which doesn't seem too bad to me, but the idle temps seem really high to me. I can get them lower with a more aggressive fan curve, but does that seem high to you guys? I've seen posts online about others' idle temps being 25-35C.  I have removed the GPU from my case completely and gone at it with air duster pretty thoroughly, so I don't think dust is my issue, my house stays fairly cool. The room it's in never gets above 70F/21C.

Edit: I'm running the latest drivers as well

Didn't actually turn out as black and white as I had hoped so I hesitated using that name. I'll probably add white cable sleeving in the future though

Prices are a but off since I live in Aus and my monitors were much cheaper than that. 

**Watercooling Gear -**

XSPC Raystorm CPU Block

2x XSPC Rasa GPU Block

Bitspower Fittings

XSPC EX240 Radiator

Phobya Xtreme 200 Radiator

XSPC Dual Bay DDC Reservoir

Laing DDC Pump

Primochill LRT white tubing.

The watercooling gear all up cost me just over $900 :/ but it was great fun putting it all together so that makes up for it.

The temperature differences are amazing. Playing BF3 with my old 212 Evo put my CPU at about 70C and GPUs between 70 and 80C. I increased the CPU to 4.8GHz and battlefield never gets it above 50 and the GPUs never go above 40. Everything Idles around 28C.

And a big thanks goes out to Canarka who was very patient with my hundred and one questions about his set up which is similar to mine

I am keeping it clocked at 3.9GHz right now because I really haven't had a lot of time to play with it this week. I ran it all the way up to 4.4GHz and it started to get buggy and I ran out of time to fiddle with it...  It does run completely stable at 3.9GHz (using AMD Overdrive...how sweet is that application? Awesome...)  and the H60 keeps it nice and cool. Haven't seen a temp above 50C yet. The H60 works pretty well for how inexpensive it is and how easy it is to install.

This is the first gaming build I have done in a few years and it was a lot of fun. I actually got the CPU and motherboard for free from work. We had to test some encryption/recording software on the Bulldozer. I picked out the motherboard and the CPU with the idea that I would take them home and put together a PC after the project was completed. I know there are a lot of Intel fans here on r/gamingpc

This has just been a ton of fun. I got a lot of help from [/r/gamingpc](/r/gamingpc) and [/r/buildapc](/r/buildapc). Thanks so much.
