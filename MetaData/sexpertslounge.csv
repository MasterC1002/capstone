And it's finally happened! Happened the first time a few weeks ago, and sometimes just continuously for ages.

The thing that I didn't understand and I basically figured out on my own, but very very different from g-spot orgasm.

Thing is I thought it would be basically the same thing, or what I've had so far, is an insanely aroused, powerful feeling deep inside that literally leaves me unable to breathe for about 10 seconds over and over again. Makes me contract everything in my body and dig my nails in. I can also keep going with sex afterwards if we slow down a bit, then comes right back once we speed up. After I'm literally left there feeling like a happy pile of fluff that wants to be cuddled but can't even move. :3

1341449494.0,w20fq,4-Hour Body Guide to Incredible Sex? This is worth a read.,kronos299,30,6,11,"The book 4-Hour Body by Tim Ferris claims many ""body hacks"" that are rooted in self-experiment based on advice from various studies and experts. One section is on Incredible Sex. It features three main parts: three improved sex positions

The sex positions are improved angle missionary (where the woman's pelvis is raised and the man's knees are under his shoulders to more of a kneeling position)

The fifteen minute orgasm is where the man very lightly strokes the clitoris in the ""one o'clock"" position (the upper right quadrant while facing the clitoris). The man attempts to be otherwise motionless and keeps the strokes at a constant rhythm. The woman is supposed to focus on the sensation and be aware that there is no objective and just to experience it.

For the increase in testosterone he recommends 3 brazil nuts twice daily, and 2 capsules of fermented cod liver oil + vitamin-rich butter fat twice daily (for what I believe is the Vitamin A and the cholesterol). Then for an extra boost he recommend 24 hours before sex to eat 800 milligrams of cholesterol before bed (in eggs, meat, etc.). 4 hours before sex he recommends 4 brazil nuts, 20 almonds and 2 capsules of the liver oil/butter fat. These in conjunction allegedly greatly boost testosterone levels and makes sex incredible.

Of course these claims are seem unbelievable. I've referred this advice to a friend and his girlfriend personally thanked me saying that the fifteen minute orgasm was one of the greatest experiences of her life. But I tried it on my girlfriend twice (while not following all the books directions) and she didn't particularly enjoy it.

I've tried the improved pressure missionary with some very good results (lasted longer and my girlfriend loved it). I've also tried some of the testosterone increases with little notable change to my sex drive. I couldn't find the vitamin-rich butter fat and I used lower doses of Vitamin D and the liver oil and I practiced the daily directions sporadically. So those changes could have caused the problem or these changes normally only effect people that don't already have a high sex drive (as I do).

I've never questioned my approach to sex. I figured that I just had a naturally high libido and that was that. He has a lower libido, I feel like I need it to to be productive with my day. There are times when I definitely have to postpone doing work to either have sex or masturbate, and times when I didn't have the means to do so and spent the day unable to focus or get anything done. And then there are the days when I skip classes/meetings/whatever because I spent the day in bed with my vibrator, even when I know I should go, even if I want to go in some sense, but I feel like I just can't. Luckily my current job has flexible hours.

Anyway, “you are more than just sex and when we do it everyday, it seems like that is the only thing our relationship is about,"" which makes him feel ""objectified."" 

I honestly had no idea that I was hurting him. I can understand what he is saying, so it's hard for me to truly understand where he's coming from. 

We tried to develop a compromise so that he isn't left feeling pressured to have sex every day or inadequate and I'm not left feeling unwanted or inadequate either

1350421862.0,11laez,Husband and I with majorly f*cked up sexual issues,throwaway7893456,23,8,21,"I’m not sure what subreddit to put this in… it’s both sex and relationship advice. Really it’s more like needed psychotherapy. 

You know how everyone has these d secret sexual taboo memories or experiences, playing with each other, and eventually my brother trying to emulate the porn movie we found in the parents’ bedroom… fortunately he was unsuccessful and neither of us had any real comprehension of what was going on or what it meant. I wouldn’t call it abuse, because it was just an odd mutual and innocent playing around. We’ve since for the most part forgotten about it, except two years ago when he tried to apologize to me, and I somewhat embarrassedly responded “you don’t have to apologize for that,” and just left it there because I didn’t feel the need to acknowledge it anymore. Its taboo

For my husband it was the exact same thing

For the first three years we dated these things remained a mystery. It wasn’t until we went on a mini vacation for my birthday, LSD, and cocaine. This night didn’t really seem much different from the other times we tripped. Not until we had sex and then started talking about it afterward, which lead to a pretty extensive conversation… which leads to us revealing these secrets. It was uplifting and amazing… I felt that the drugs really opened the gates to each other’s guilt and shame and we could come to terms with it. We both felt more understanding of each other, that knowing you could have someone you could confide in so much you tell them something you have never told anyone. I felt better about it, and so did he, we felt like we weren’t fucked up anymore, I know

From that moment on shit went from acceptance to SUPER acceptance to, but the idea of a brother and sister sleeping together drives me nuts. And not just that, but dad and daughter too although I never even had any sexual experience with my father. I should clarify too that we are not turned on by rape or sexual abuse (which I suppose can probably be defined this way, but it’s not how I define it) it only turns us on when both parties are consensual, no force. Anyway, we did this for a while, I want to say several months. Then one day I asked him if I always had to pretend to be his sister, plain and simple? He said something along the lines of

His sister and her husband came to visit us. We were drunk, especially because “Bob” (sister’s husband) has been talking to me about how close you and your sister are, how he’s never seen a brother and sister so close, that you both have a special relationship that he can’t match.” I don’t remember what he said, but he went out back and had whatever conversation he had with her. I stayed inside and uncomfortably talked to Bob. 

The next day a horrible anxiety is burning inside of me and my husband is at work, we do.” Then he comes home and I start to ask him questions and he hardly even talks to me, essentially brushes me off. Every time I try to talk to him about this he becomes extremely defensive. 

Since then I’ve felt this horrible jealousy, and whatever else. And I knew he was withholding things from me because he wanted to spare my feelings. 

Eventually I asked him if he wanted to fuck his sister or just the idea of his sister. This made a huge difference to me. He said the idea, that he loves large breasts (which I have, not  huge, just a D).  This assured me slightly, but I still couldn’t help but want to know EVERY SINGLE WORD that was exchanged between them… I am jealous and paranoid beyond reason… but I tried to stop nagging him for answers. 

I forget about for about two months. Then it all comes back to me, I don’t want to be, but I find that I’m no different) and he consoles me: “It’s not you baby it’s me… I love you… we have the best sex ever I’m just tired…“ etc. I try to get a hold of myself but I just don’t let it go. 

The next day I’m still fucking horny, and I just completely shut down, don’t want to talk about it anymore, just want to cool down and try to stop taking so much offense. 

He texts me at work that night and says he’s sorry, this sense that he was only half there, not enjoying it as much as he used to. Later on that day I get horny again (we used to have A LOT of sex up until this past month, sometimes multiple times in one day) and I start playing around with him again. Then it’s like I end up begging him for it. He tells me again that it’s not me, that he just feels that sex is weird now. I wanted elaboration but I got none. 

So I holed up again. I didn’t know how to approach the subject in a constructive way anymore. Nothing was ever resolved every time we talked about it. I increasingly became more jealous, and lost all self-esteem.  I was in the middle of studying when I just had to get my feelings out on paper. I basically wrote a letter to him. Then last night he reads it and we start talking about it over a glass of wine. Right off the bat, he was completely defensive. He started to elaborate on the conversation with the sister and told me he regrets talking to her about it, because she told him that talking about it has made things dangerous and I completely agree, because he told me that at the end of their conversation they were both aroused. 

Now I’m totally fucked up in the head. That just blows my mind. All I can think about is my husband talking to his sister with a raging erection and it infuriates me. I’m also pissed because he withheld these details from me, but only the idea. He lied because he got a fucking boner. Because she was wet or whatever the fuck. And clearly, they both had to have acknowledged it to each other and all I wonder is HOW exactly did that happen? How do you talk about being horny for each other without… I don’t know… taking it another step. 

I don’t know what to do. No health insurance. Can’t afford therapy. I don’t think I could look somebody in the face and tell them all this

 td;lr: My husband and I fucked around with our siblings when we were young, both get aroused during that conversation; I’m infuriated, sad, and jealous.




**Update:** Thanks for the advice guys. We've done the whole ""lay the cards out on the table"" multiple times, last time I tried to get some things off my chest (Tuesday) it went very badly, and my husband wasn't just defensive this time he was also very aggressive. With all the irrational thoughts that have been throwing me into the abyss as of late, this just threw me over the edge-- the panic was so bad I thought the only way to stop it was to end my life. I tried to overdose on some pills, luckily didn't (suicidal behavior is something I've also struggled with for a long time-- first time I've acted on it though.) I certainly don't blame anyone for it, especially my husband, who was by my side the whole time. I'm sure it was more than just this issue that was a contributing factor. 

Anyway, obviously, since we were so open about it to the point of exploring it further, and in terms of my ""moral"" principles I don't think it was wrong (both the act itself and what we did afterward). How we deal with it now I don't think is an issue of right or wrong, there's no point in looking at it that way now unless we want to cause further feelings of guilt/shame/regret etc.

Thanks for helping me out guys. At the very least you all made me feel less ashamed about the whole thing. Now I just have to deal with the aftermath of the huge shit storm this has become because of my stupid fucking actions. (Imagine waking up in the hospital

I'm a 24yo female

I'm not sure how to describe it but I'll try: When having sex eventually I'll get to this point where suddenly something deep inside of me will feel amazingly good.  It's not like a ""wave"" crashing over me though like a clitoral orgasm is.  The way I've described it to my boyfriend is that it basically feels like the build up of the potential orgasm, as long as there's a penis moving inside me I'll stay at that point.  I wont come down from it unless if I have like 5-10 seconds of chill time.  Also this mostly only happens when having very deep penetrative sex, like when I'm on top, but it can happen in other positions as well.

While this is great in a sense it's kinda ridiculous.  The first time this happened was with my ex, and all this stupid shit that I wasn't having an ""orgasm"" right.  So when it happened I always felt pretty anxious as I really can't imagine anything feeling better than that?  Like, if something felt better I'm pretty sure it would either hurt or I would literally pass out.

I was never a very sexually inclined person until about two years ago. A little after my 18th birthday I just exploded with hormones and suddenly could not stop thinking about sex. It was very strange for me and I just tried to ignore it. I grew up in a very conservative Christian household and would never have considered ever acknowledging any sort of dirty thoughts like that

However starting around age 19

I was shocked to discover that many women masturbate. I had had a vague knowledge that a small percentage of perverted, aka the real world, female masturbation was not only common, but considered normal.

Around a year ago

The closest that I came to any sort of feeling was when I was staying at a hotel a couple of months ago and had access to a detachable shower-head. When I aimed the high intensity water at my clit

I am horny all the time and constantly fantasize about sex. I have absolutely no problem getting myself aroused and wet from my imagination

I've read plenty about women struggling to climax or orgasm. My problem is that I don't feel pleasure AT ALL. 

It's extremely frustrating. 

Is this just a psychological block based on my strict religious upbringing in which anything sexual was from satan tempting us? Am I still feeling some sort of residual guilt? Will this go away when I finally have my first sexual encounter with another human? Is there something medically wrong with me? Should I see a doctor?

It just frustrates me because I read these stories about women having their first orgasms at age 13 and I can't seem to figure this crap out as an adult.

Things are going well, and she initiates going down on me again for a few minutes.  It's very start-stop with talking in between, but it's not actually contiguous enough to get close to cumming.  She suggests using the hitachi on herself whilst felating me and I agree she should go get it.

We've had our good and bad periods in the past (we had a 3 month 'dead bedroom' for a bit which was extremely difficult, but the intimacy and physicality were still really nice (for both of us), as was being desired (for me).


We haven't had sex for about three weeks, she does not drink excessively or do drugs and there are seemingly no other complicating medical factors (she isn't on any medication). I haven't put on weight and am in okay shape, and still put a lot of effort into my appearance, hygiene and grooming… She says she still finds me attractive (and for the most part, I believe her). 


We are both very comfortable being naked

She tells me that she has not really felt desirable or beautiful for a while (she is stunning and in great shape, turned around and started crying a little. She eats healthily, exercises (yoga 1-3 times a week) and is possibly/probably is going to get a gym membership soon. She is gorgeous but I understand that she does not see herself with the same eyes that I see her. I don't really know how to be any more supportive on this front. In addition, even times when her self-esteem has been better our sex drives have not really matched (mine higher) but the situation has not been so infrequent or bad. Our sex was less vanilla, more passionate, and she would sometimes climax from me going down on her. We would both initiate some and both generally desired sex.


Penetrative sex has generally not been super pleasurable for her (although occasionally we will hit a position/angle that she REALLY enjoys) and she can only orgasm from penetration very rarely (yes I know this is the case for the majority of women) while I can the majority of the time. I try and put a lot of effort into learning to be a better lover, I have a lot to learn, but I think I'm okay. I love going down on her and am always happy to (and always offer to before/after intercourse if she doesn't orgasm) but for the last month of sex [prior to the dry spell] she has not wanted me to. I'm not really sure what other sexual activities to engage in that she can enjoy or orgasm from… She doesn't really desire to be fingered when we were having sex the last few times, and just kinda wanted me to get hard, use lube, and have sex. This also made me feel a bit less desirable and almost selfish and that she was just doing it for my pleasure rather than hers.

I'm not really sure where to go from here, although this was qualified by ""if it'll make you happy"" which kinda worries me a bit. She worries we are going to break up over this and I reassure her that I love her and have patience left in me, and this is the truth. But it still is hard for me to cope. I don't think I have a particularly high sex drive, more of an average one… but after a week and a half of no sex I get a bit more irritable regarding our relationship and little issues I'd otherwise be unperturbed by begin to bother me more, and this just gets more difficult to deal with the longer we don't have sex for. I have gotten a lot better and patient at dealing with this, but I hate feeling this way and building any resentment towards the situation and my relationship. She has told me she doesn't really enjoy giving oral so on the occasion when she does offer that instead I am not really turned on by it (and can't get even close to orgasm from it) and hand jobs are pretty unsatisfying. I would be far more satisfied of a sexual session which consisted of some mutually enjoyable play (i.e. me going down on her, something I love

Throughout my history of having sex

Premature ejaculation is an affliction that seems to easily affect many men in any age group, have the exact opposite. To put it simply, I am a lot of work to get off.

I've noticed several things that I have to put a considerable amount of mental and physical concentration to orgasm. Too much to effectively implement in an intense and passionate act of intercourse. 

I suppose it might be the result of over a decade's worth of dry masturbation.

Also

This problem has been brought to the forefront when, she's nice enough to focus on me afterward and makes me cum in her mouth, so I get my share of fun in the end.

This problem is complicated

1. I don't lose things in 30 seconds

2. If I cannot orgasm during intercourse

But I am DESPERATE at this point to know that feeling of just letting go inside a woman.

Any suggestions?

(lengthy),primalj,10,1,18,"I don’t feel like I’m in a relationship anymore… I feel like I have a phenomenal best friend and roommate, they were going at it like bunnies at this point in time.  If I have no romance now

•	I’ll start by saying that I have a very high libido.  If I could go for multiple hours a session

•	I’ve tried every romantic thing I can think of.  I can spontaneously bring home flowers.  I can make dinner.  I can give back, neck, scalp massages (which are now *asked* for and *expected* and my wife gets quite pouty if I don’t immediately step up).  I can do any combination of these things and have even taken her to a spa for relaxation.

•	I may see physical sex once every 10 days or so.  Even then, but half the time my wife just lies there, typically complains of discomfort if she’s not 100% comfortable in every way, and has a very passive look on her face with her eyes closed most of the time.  It doesn’t instill confidence that she wants me.  It just feels like she’s ‘taking it’ to appease me.  Don’t get me wrong, sometimes it’ll come in ebb and flow and I’ll see a day or two almost consecutively.  But it’s rare, and I ~~practically~~ have to beg.

•	If I ask for sex

•	There’s almost never any foreplay.  She doesn’t like to ‘touch’ me, bad tastes, etc), and typically it’s done within 20 minutes (if not less).

•	She climaxes (or at least claims to).  She swears she’s never ‘faked, if she cannot climax, she gets rather frustrated.  But to further my conviction that she does, there are the physiological anecdotes that go along with it, which are rather telling.  I *do* pay attention! 

•	Even when trying to kiss my wife passionately, quick pecks as if to say “I’m done kissing you now, stop.”

•	If we talk about any of this, adult conversations, and some rather heated debates regarding the topic.  At the end of the conversation (which is typically after I express my feelings on the subject), I normally receive a response such as “I don’t know what you want me to do about it.  I just don’t want to have sex.”

•	I’ve never been unfaithful.  Though the thought has crossed my mind.  And I feel like a terrible person for having had those thoughts.  And that’s kind of why I’m here.  I’m hoping for some advice.  I want to make my wife happy

•	I do ‘take care of myself’ when I have the chance.  It’s not enough.  I require physical human contact and emotion, and lusting.  I miss it so.  But lately, my wife left her career to start her own business.  She’s in the very beginning stages of the business and so she is home when I leave and when I return from work.  I don’t really feel comfortable taking care of myself when she’s home.

•	I’ve gotten to the point where I can’t sleep at night, I actually left the bed and slept in the guest room because the tension (from my end) was unbearable, and otherwise I could not sleep.  I’m a very healthy (health conscious) individual, and typically I fall asleep within 15 minutes of hitting the pillow, sleep through the night, and awake on my own refreshed before the alarm clock goes off.  Now I’m lucky if I sleep 5 hours a night, tossing and turning due to my ‘frustration.’

•	When my wife and I first started dating, saw her for a weekend, left for 4 more months, but was able to see her 3 weekends throughout that time.  This was 3 years ago.  It was when I returned that I proposed and we were married 9 months later.  It was shortly before I left that our sex life started to stagger.  I assumed it was because I was living 2 hours away (for my career) and she felt uncomfortable with physical things as she was living with her sister, who was almost always home when we were there.  It was when I returned from training that it became almost nonexistent.

This is probably more than enough information to give you a picture of what I’m facing currently.  I’m not sure what to do… any thoughts

What do I feel that I need: a semi-consistent physical relationship.  Someone who *wants* me, loving relationship with the thrills of wild, romantic sex, with all of the foreplay and all of the sweaty, forceful, primal nature of the epitome of passion.  I guess I want to be wanted as much as I want…

I always have to initiate and she only seems to want to have sex after she's got ready for bed. Which leads to a lack of spontaneity I guess.. So at the moment we have sex 1-2 times a week. A couple weeks ago we had foreplay for about 20-30 minutes but when it came to the act she was bone dry

She has trouble orgasm'ing but managed to get her to climax once by oral.. I often find that if I do manage to get her close she forces me to stop.. I've asked what she likes and how I can make it better but never really get an answer out of her..

I asked if she masturbates and she said she doesn't and never gets the urge to.. She also said that she found the fact that I masturbate creepy. Although not an issue I guess it gives further light on the issue?

Recently the lack of passion and me feeling that I'm basically quilting her into having sex with me have started to think she's getting it elsewhere but.. rationally I don't think that would ever happen.

1. In term of condoms, but from what I was seeing online there was very little with actual measurements of what size the condom is made for, and more with ambiguous labels like ""small"", ""normal"", ""large"", ""x-large"". I'd rather not buy a bunch of different condoms and try them all on, but maybe that's what I have to do?

2. I've certainly heard stories of girls having discomfort with longer penises, but is my size gonna be a problem in terms of discomfort or fitting?

3. This feels silly to ask, but I've been told that Asian girls are generally tighter than non-Asians. Is this even true? If so, will it give me problems in possible future sexual encounters with Asian girls?

4. Is there a difference in the woman's experience between a wider (mine is considerably wider than it is tall, and I've also seen people suggesting that a more circular penis might do more in terms of hitting the g-spot. Any experiences or information on that?

5. I guess this is just a general question about the female experience with thick penises. What's it like? What kind of an experience is a sex partner of mine likely to have (once I get past cumming before penetration even begins)?

I enjoy doing it, but sometimes when I'm riding him and I come and squirt I worry that I may have just peed on him. :(

So, and then when I'm done I smell it (again, I know, I know....) and it's all goopy and SMELLING LIKE PEE.  Omg. :(  Reddit, I finally enjoy manual sex and then I make a huge mess of it. :(  And now I feel apprehensive about playing with myself AND having sex tonight.  Blah. :( 

So

Anyone know about the physiology of squirting or something?  The internet isn't terribly fruitful.

Anyone have the same experience with having no sex drive and then all of a sudden being launched into one?  It wasn't like I was on the pill or anything either.  Just... normal development.  Maybe because I didn't start my period until I was 17?

Anyone else find manual stimulation boring like I did?

1.

But every time I my arm literally gets so tired I can't keep a proper rhythm (this is after about 5 minutes by the way) and we always come up short.  What can I do to help her achieve a healthy, amazing female ejaculation? 


2.  My girlfriend and I have talked about anal and ass play numerous times (I sort of have a fetish for it), there will be little to no pain, and if there is any we can stop.  Second off, she's convinced that because of the size of my penis which she says is really big, I think it's not too impressive but whatever, her asshole will be permanently gaped or spread open from it.

We tried different positions and rubbing it semi-hard on her area, but nothing worked, I was just getting softer.  She was really upset and it was pretty bad...

Anyways, but yet again, same problem.  I can tell that if it happens again, things might go really really badly.  

Last night (a few nights after our last attempt at sex) she tried just fooling around with me and doing stuff to me, no luck.   To add though (which was probably dumb of me), I took half an adderall that night a few hours before we tried fooling around, so I HOPE that was the reason fooling around didnt work.  

TLDR;  I have some questions regarding sex! (not really a tldr

When I was in college, and after orgasms, I was able to stay hard as if nothing had happened. With my second partner, I have had the same experience for the first few years (I am currently seeing her). 

It's been several years since then and I have noticed a progressive decrease in everything over the past 18-24 months. It's more difficult for me to become hard and I'm not as hard as I used to be. I even think my penis has gotten smaller. After having an orgasm, it is a little easier, but my erections are definitely not as fulfilling as they once were. Also, I talked to my doctor; he didn't see anything abnormal and my testosterone levels were okay. Even my partner has noticed this change and sometimes she feels she's the reason why, as if she isn't doing something right or I don't find her attractive any more, which is certainly not the case. I still very much love her and she turns me on. However, I just don't feel as horny as I used to. I have almost completely stopped watching porn and masturbating as I don't ""feel"" like doing it.

I'm not obese

She kisses/caresses my neck, and chest, and inner thigh. These spots give me pleasure but it I'm still flaccid.  I rarely obtain an erection while ensuing other activity (giving oral sex, kissing, foreplay).  The one sure way to experience an erection is to manually stimulate my penis, but it is difficult to obtain results.  I believe erectile dysfunction runs in my family (dad and grandfather).  

Climax is also difficult to achieve by means of a partners stimulation.  Through masturbation it is successful but I feel bad that I can please her to multiple orgasms but she can't please me to a consistent one. This has been a common theme throughout previous sexual engagements with others.  Communication seems to aid in the climaxing but not the non-penile stimulation issue.

Mental / Mindset concerns 

1. While im masturbating my head is filled with lots of thoughts and desires about the girls in my life that i would like to date and the things id like them to do with me,(very shitty i know), even if it took a lot of effort to get her involved with me. i fear that if i were to get into a relationship i would ultimately push her away due to my inability to continue the sexual desires past the point of climax.. DEA have this issue?

Physical anomaly 

2. Is it possible to have hypersensitivity of the penis (glans)? I feel i may have hypersensitivity for touch, (more than 5 thrusts), is impossible. the fact that i am hypersensitive to begin with doesn't go away once i cum, in fact it gets to the point that if anything touches my penis after, i will use all my strength to end the contact, regardless of what it is.

These 2 issues work in conjunction to put me in a weird limbo area

Pleasure all round

3. I am not worried i wont be able to bring her to climax , and wait till round 3 starts where my dick is numb enough from the numbing rubbers that i can do actual fucking. Is there a mindset i could force myself into that could help?

TLDR: want to fuck like a rabbit

Hello

I'm in a long distance relationship, because I'd come too fast. So usually we start with oral sex. She gives me a blowjob, I go down on her, everybody's pretty happy. The problem is that most of the times after the first orgasm my penis is dry and oversensitive and it's not hard enough to put a condom on it. Sometimes it even hurts me when she gives me a handjob (after a blowjob and me going down on her).

I'm trying to nofap (thanks to r/nofap) since October with rather mediocre results (my biggest streak counts 17 days). However, but I don't really know if they work (I haven't been able to penetrate her for a month now). If I masturbate and try do stop orgasming by doing a long kegel, it just doesn't work - I have an orgasm, but I don't ejaculate and then my penis flattens.

Do you have any advice for me? I'd really like to pleasure her in a way I couldn't pleasure her before.",,t5_2shg2,True,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/sexpertslounge/comments/tezfz/edpe_related_problems_looking_for_help/

Basically I'm not happy with how erect I get during sex.  

While masturbating, without difficulty.

However, i'll have difficulty keeping a solid erection.  With penis on vag stimulation, it can get a bit hard, but certainly nowhere near as hard as masturbation.  And if I choose, I could keep an erection via masturbation for 20+ minutes without difficulty - and it will be rock hard the whole time.

Some other info:
Hand Jobs / Blow Jobs, my skin actually gets sore (very easily) and then pain sets in - nothing is happening after that.  I've only came maybe once or twice from blow jobs, and it takes a LOT of effort - and if they try too hard - pain.  Intercourse - I come within a few minutes.

During intercourse

With my ex-wife

The few times where we did more than just intercourse - didn't work as well.

So, that's the thing, I relax, which doesn't help.

I have super sensitive skin all around the body so if it gets ""over-stimulated"", at least, not down there.

I'm seeing a dermatologist about my skin (need to do a body-wide mole/cancer checkup anyways) so I guess my uncertainty boils down to these:

1) Nervousness?  (I have confidence in my foreplay ability but now nervous about intercourse itself)

2) Skin condition? (Too much stimulation is bad)

3) Straight up ED?

Guess if I were to go see someone about this

Medications:
I'm currently on Verapamil for migraines, nothing unusual like anti-depressants or anything.

Thanks in advance for any advice or direction!

About half of the time

I have an extremely hard time getting aroused because I am on both birth control and anti-depressants, and he thinks it is because I'm not attracted to him, even though I've explained it is not that and due to my meds.

He loses erections extremely fast. He hates the feel of condoms (even though we buy ultra-thins). By the time we try to switch positions, I can NEVER be on top. Grinding on top does nothing for him, and he says he needs me to go straight up and down, which so far, I haven't figured out how to do. The only way we ever did was on a chair, which made it much easier for me to go up and down instead of a more diagonal or scooting motion (does that make sense?).

Because he loses erections quickly, he would never lose his erections. This makes me feel horrible, and him feel like less of a man because he loses them.

We've been together for 6 years, lots of oral (which I love). Then, when we moved in together, the sex tapered off. It went down to a couple of times a week and oral maybe once every couple of months. She suffers from depression and has problems with her moods, so I've always attributed the lows to that, but recently it's been coming up more and more that she just isn't as into sex as I thought. 

The drop in frequency has been something I've had a hard time getting out of my head. I've got a mild anxiety disorder and it's hard for me to stop thinking about it all. It's gotten to the point where the fact that we haven't had sex in a bit tends to put me in a mental spiral where I stop being as excited. I get all stuck up in my own thoughts and then when we do start to get intimate

We've done stuff in the past that was quite adventurous - anal fingering, but I also feel terrible that several of my sexual fantasies are pretty much never going to happen. I know that fantasies sometimes need to stay as they are, but it hurts a little. 

Now, and when I chatted to her to see if she would want to talk about sex in a more neutral time, she told me she didn't want to talk about it at all - that it's not something she *can* talk about. 

So now I'm stuck. I put too much pressure on her to live up to my sexual expectations and now it's crumbling from the inside. I love her completely, but I don't know how to fix what's happened between us. I don't feel like she's willing to meet me part way, and I can't explain how I feel without hurting her more.

Porn very seldom does anything for me. Be it pictures or videos

The reason this is strange is because, I could almost say I hate them. My immediate collection of friends seem to share my belief that the lines (in our instance) are very set in stone. Now I'm not saying some people don't genuinely want to experiment or develop different attractions -- I know that happens. It's kind of a ""joining the majority"" or ""us and them"" mentality and I find myself (perhaps even highly irrationally) holding a lot of contempt for those gay men who decide to temporarily ""go straight.""

And yet I find myself becoming super hard thinking about them and visualizing the scenario. It's both extremely frustrating and infuriating to me as it is hot. Am I turned on by the idea of something I hate? 

Before you begin to ask, an anti-boner for me in all ways (no offense ladies, I'm just not interested in that way). It has nothing to do with some deep-down heterosexual tendency I have. Again, I actually really strongly dislike the idea of a gay man trying women. 

So what gives? There are lots of things I hate in this world: people kicking puppies or hurting babies or something. None of those things turn me on. Why am I simultaneously scoffing at bi-curious gays and jerking off to them?

I had to make a throw-away because I'm somewhat scared of my friends finding out. I wish I could understand this myself


TL;DR --become very sexually aroused at the thought of bi-curious gay men even though I truly hate the idea.

I enjoy sex for the companionship of it? I like experimentation, if you see the difference? This maybe isn't unusual?

I'm 20 years old and have a bit of a problem with premature ejaculation. Let's be clear though that sometimes I can last long. Honestly I think it's an anxiety issue

First off I'm 7 inches and every girl I've been with said I was endowed. I'm not self conscious about my size

First girlfriend - never came early. We never had sex

Next girl - this occurred about 4 months after I broke up with my girlfriend. We started doing stuff and then BAM

Second semester - hook up with a couple girls. same thing

Over the summer I masturbated a lot and looked into premature ejaculation. I tried the stop start and practiced my KP's. I was doing pretty well.

First semester sophomore year - I have a new confidence and I want to lost my virginity. I started dating this girl and after about 2 weeks we are both drunk and we have sex. I last probably 10 minutes

Over the next semester I hooked up with a few people

Now comes the new girlfriend. We've been dating for almost a month and I've been practicing my KP's and stop start for about 2 weeks. Tonight was embarrassing. We're starting to fool around and I'm fingering her

I'm embarrassed. I told her I came and I laughed and she just kind of laughed too. She didn't judge me; we just kind of left it at that. Why is this happening and how can I fix it? It's to the point where I don't even want to have sex...

* **We get aroused at different times** - For both of us, but if not, then we just aren't in the mood.  And for some reason, We are rarely in sync: She gets aroused during the day, and for me its mostly at night.  Not a huge problem, but any idea whats causing it?

* **Touble getting her to cum** - I know that this shouldnt be entirely unexpected from a first timer, oral, g-epot and clitoral stimulation, and nothing seems to work, no matter how long we're at it for (current best is 2 hours, and after her not cumming from that i got a little worried about what I'M doing wrong).  Don't get me wrong, she enjoys it

* **She stops me from making her cum** - I'll need a female opinion on this one.  She has told me she's never cum before, and we're both worried about privacy).  But i can't get a straight answer out of her.  Except for one time.  She said she didn't want to, because if she enjoyed it it would raise expectations for me, and she wouldnt enjoy normal sex anymore.  Any help here?

* **Fingering issues** - plain and simple: she loves it when i stimulate her G-Spot

* **She is annoyingly selfless** - She always wants me to cum; thats her priority during sex.  So during foreplay, and she enjoys it too, but she just wants me to cum and doesnt care about herself.  help?

Was walking near my neighborhood and this random lady calls out to me for some help inside her car.

I just feel a bit timid about taking it too far given that I don't know what to say or do. I think that's partly why it took me so long to finish (that or too much porn, maybe both), but at the end she manages to get me off after much work. 

Said she wanted to meet again to have more fun but honestly I feel completely clueless. I had never even kissed before and about 3 or 4 times we clinked teeth

I'm pretty sure she must have figured out I'm a rookie but if anyone has any advice on how to tackle someone who likes so roughplay (how much is too much?). At one point she asked me to bite her but then complained about some marks (even tho she left me a good amount). Is this something that is verbally discussed or do you just go play by play on it?
