I've been out for 18 years or so and I don't have (m)any bisexual friends. Heck

I have a male friend who I've known for 15 years. He identified as straight before I knew him and identified as bi when I met him. He has only been with and talked about men since I've known him in those 15 years

So, that might make assumptions about you. They might think you're straight, they might believe you're confused, they might assume you're gay. It's not necessarily because they don't accept who you are, or because they're in denial, it might just be because of an assumption made early on that snowballed into a belief.

What I'm really trying to say, they might just need you to remind them.

Thanks :) Big hugs to everyone.",,t5_2qwnx,False,,ainbow,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/bisexual/comments/1c0zdc/as_a_gay_guy_im_glad_i_joined_rbisexual_its/

1376469170.0,1kc5t8,Finally Crossed the Line With Best Friend,anonbyday,238,25,32,"My best friend and I have known each other for about 5 years now. We used to work together and bonded almost immediately. A little over 2 years ago (within about 6 months of each other) we ended up getting divorces from our spouses. Mine was due to her infidelities and his was more because of her drinking and financially ruining him. We were both left in a pretty rough spot financially and decided to become roommates. 

Before moving in I decided to come out to him. He was my best friend and we were going to be living together so I thought he should know. And now that I was single again I wasn't going to hide who I was anymore. I have always been attracted to both men and women but due to a severe religious upbringing I married early because it was what I was ""supposed"" to do. I was really worried that coming out to him would freak him out and ruin our friendship but the exact opposite happened. He kinda laughed when I finally told him my big secret and said it was no big deal and that he was bi also. 

We moved in together and life was good and our friendship seemed to deepen. We both actively dated people and routinely brought our dates home. I tended to bring home guys more than women and he almost exclusively brought home women. Due to thin walls neither of us had much doubt about what the other was doing when we brought them home.

During this time however I started to realize I was becoming more and more attracted to him. He's young

Recently our company had a series of layoffs and we both lost our jobs. Thankfully we were both able to find new ones pretty quick but while mine was in the same city

We both had a couple beers and I took the plunge. I looked him in the eyes and told him how much I had been attracted to him and that I felt like I had a crush on him. We talked about it and he said that he also found me attractive. He never said anything because he didn't want to ruin our friendship or make things awkward. But now he was moving away and there wasn't any reason to hold back. He asked me what I wanted to do the most

We had only been kissing for a moment when I put my hands in his pants. Before long we were undressed and we did everything. I've always been more of a bottom when I'm with men and he took the role of top with no problem. By the end we were exhausted and fell asleep in each others arms under on the couch. 

Waking up next to him was one of the greatest feelings ever. We snuggled and talked about the night before and how we had wasted so much time not doing it before now. We had a long serious talk after breakfast. His new job was several hours away. We'd never be able to see each other as much as we would want. Serious talk became more serious. I felt like crying but kept it together. We looked at our savings and financial situation and since my new job will be paying significantly more than the old one and we both have a decent amount of savings

I'm a 23 year-old gay male. I'm not very active in my local LGBTQ community, calling it a phase or an excuse. I even have a close (lesbian) friend who I've discussed the issue with, but she remains convinced bisexuality doesn't exist. I find this idea insulting and hypocritical. I think it's as if they're saying ""people should believe *me* when *I* say that I'm gay and it's not a choice or an act, but they shouldn't believe *those bisexual people*. Oh no. *They're* different.""

I am also a big flirt.  My girlfriend &amp; I are in an open relationship.  The bisexual girls I meet (and flirt with) have always been understanding of my relationship arrangement and don't try to force monogamy on me.  They don't make assumptions and are generally fun and mature.  Oh

Bisexual people I have met are the first to stand up for me if I'm being harassed at a bar.  They will defend my lesbian identity even as my fellow lesbians diss them.

When I was about 20, I started to suspect that I may still have a lingering attraction for men.  Upon the urging of my best friend, I started searching for an appropriate candidate for some hetero sexual exploration.

So, and filled him in on the situation. He was completely down for it.  You know, being the helpful guy he was. *Such a giver, that one*.

I said to him, it's fine. Just keep going. You have a pretty low bar to hurdle here,"" He said, ""Well, let's get to it then. No reason to make this awkward, let's go to the bedroom.""  I have some serious respect for any guy that could still get hard after hearing this.

We went to the bedroom and the foreplay started. He was a bit on the smaller side on all counts (I chose this on purpose. I needed to make certain I didn't feel threatened).  We undressed each other and got right down to it.  I had a couple moments where I felt a little weird

We spent about 3 hours re-initiating me into the land of heterosexual-a-go-go-land. The entry was somewhat painful

We went down to his couch to watch game of thrones and started fooling around. Kissing a man for the first time was a strange experience

**Definition**

The definition of *bisexuality* is:
&gt;A sexual orientation in which a person is attracted to both males and females.

Some people also define it as attraction to more than one gender. You cannot control who you are attracted to. But you *can* control whether or not a label affects you. Who cares if you're bisexual or not? We surely don't!

**I'm more attracted to women one week

Absolutely not! You're perfectly normal; this happens with both female and male bisexuals. It's called *fluidity of sexuality*. It means you feel attracted to one sex for a period of time, it means being in a long-term relationship with a man and then marrying a woman. It cannot be turned on or off; it ebbs and flows uncontrollably.

[LGBTerrific](http://www.reddit.com/user/LGBTerrific) brings up a great point about fluidity of sexuality: ""[Y]ou can be attracted to men more for sex

AfterEllen posted a [great article](http://www.afterellen.com/people/2010/08/going-with-the-flow) about it and

&gt;[Candace] Walsh agreed, the more we see that things aren't so black and white.""

This is actually a huge topic that has been brought up for the past couple of years, and finally addressed. You are not alone.

**Am I pansexual?**

[Pansexuals](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pansexual), while a pansexual person may be--just to use an example. Pansexuals are also sometimes grouped in with bisexuals, which can cause pansexuals to suffer from *bisexual erasure* as well.

**Wait a second--what is bisexual erasure?**

For some reason, or going through a ""phase"" by some heterosexuals. Sometimes in the queer community, bisexuals are thought to be inferior to gays or lesbians and are told to ""pick a side."" In some communities, bisexuals are alienated because they are ""able to have hetero-privileges.""

It's not right. It's a problem that needs fixing in the LGBT community

**How do I begin to date the same sex?**

A great place to start would be [OKCupid](http://okcupid.com). It's free, either the same or opposite sex. If you're willing to throw down money, [Match.com](http://match.com) has gotten good reviews and isn't dominated by one particular sex.

Another great route to go is to participate in local LGBT groups around your town. If you're a college student, get involved with local LGBT issues or community building, and start going to LGBT events! I once met a cute girl when I helped paint our gay and lesbian community center in my town, and another when I attended a LGBTQ film festival one year.

The best way to get started is to just get out there! Put feelers out

**What other resources are out there for bisexuals?**

* [Whosoever](http://www.whosoever.org/index.shtml) -- online magazine for LGBT Christians

*Let me know in the comments if you'd like me to add any more you know of!*

**The Bottom Line**

The conclusion here is that it ***doesn't matter what you are, and only you, to decide whether or not you want to call yourself a bisexual, a pansexual, an omnisexual--but do not let these labels define you.

The LGBTQ--or QUILTBAG, or in any welcoming queer community, is going to judge you if you do or don't have a label.

The point is: **you don't have to be labeled ""bisexual"" to be a bisexual or to be apart of this community

I hope this helps anyone coming to r/bisexual looking for answers. :) We've all been through it. But instead of asking *us* whether or not you're bisexual, and a journey all in its own. Enjoy it!

Well, and to /r/AskMen about a week ago looking for advice on what to do about my boyfriend. This was eating me alive, even though I never would have even contemplated leaving him, I was afraid of what his reaction would result in. I came to the conclusion that I had to tell him at some point, but the thought made me want to throw up. What would happen to us? What if it sparks jealousy with him and he's uncomfortable when I hang out with my girlfriends? What would it mean for me and my own security to come out to him? I mean, thinking it is one thing, but SAYING it out loud is completely different. It makes it real

Well last night

***""I think that if you weren't with me

WHOA. I was fucking *speechless*. My first instinct was to deflect. To try and laugh and brush it off: ""cheaaaaah- RIGHT."" But then with the confidence from all the comments I got from Reddit, so what do you think all that means?"" (Obviously knowing what it meant but wanted to leave it open-ended to discover his feelings about it.)

And he said, and I love you so much. I always will, and I will always do everything in my power to make sure you're happy.""

BAM. It's out there

Here I am, but I didn't know that it was possible. Shockingly it launched our relationship forward 100 steps.

I do not and have never wanted to cheat on my wife.  I did not tell her to ask permission to have an open marriage.  I told her because she has a right to know about me and who I am.   We spent the first part of the morning  yesterday talking and both of us learning more about each other.  We talked about everything and basically reviewed our whole relationship.  We had had a rough patch 2 years ago.  We had talked about divorce then.  We spoke about then and how we had not really fixed anything or talked about it before.  We had just moved on.   More to the point of this post

There was plenty of tears and hugging and it ending with her saying that she loves me and is going to need lots of reassurance in the coming days.  We both ended up calling out of work and spend the day laying in bed hugging, crying, laughing.  By the end of the day we both had felt more open and intimate with each other that we had in years.

I know on the larger scale of things our little 10 year marriage is new

X we've known each other for years now. Not as close friends

This time it's different. You fucked up.

You and I both know the stereotypes of bisexuals and how in your words they ""fuck up the system"". Well stereotypes are stereotypes and unfortunately for bisexuals it hurts them more than it helps them.

Having said that, and especially not to you. If she wasn't at the party yesterday, I would've definitely kicked your ass.

She's a good kid. A straight-A student, and bunch of other shit that would make any hardass Asian parent proud. Yesterday was one of the rare occasions I saw her hurt because of her sexuality. Do you realize how much fucking work it takes to make a person like her? A Fucking Ton. You do not get to make her feel inadequate. The world can and will treat her like shit, but if I can prevent it now you can bet your ass I will.

Also give me my fucking L-word dvds back.

TL;DR Told my wife I like guys and she said ""big deal"".

I checked the rules and long rambling tlaes don't seem to be against the rules

If you want to get past the generic background I'll put a line in so you know where to skip to.

I come from a catholic family we are mostly to the democratic side of the spectrum but in a very we accept that *others* may do different things.  

When I was in my early teens I had a decent idea something was up and had a decent idea of sex so that I could express myself.  Which I did not do but that is just the midwest in the late 90's-early 2000's.  When I was in my later teens I would test the waters by talking about gay rights or bringing home *Out* magazine and then when questioned claiming I was just so into politics.  Being an awkward teen is hilarious in retrospect but hard at the time. I would go to the librairy and use the internet to post on LGBT forums.  This was in the days of AOL so we didn't even have the internet at the time.  When I hit 18 I was subsriced to The Nation and Mother Jones and every so often would get ""gay"" junk mail which again I could shrug off as political junk mail.  

I was again awkward still and didn't think things out very well so I decided to come out to my older sister who had a few gay friends in an email.  I didn't hear back from her about it.  I would pick up bits of in the other room converation where she and my mother disscussed that her gay friends felt I was confused and would be gay eventually.  I felt pretty betrayed and clamed up about it.

I went to college and tryed to tell a good freind that I had a man crush on.  I ended up rambling about unrelated things for a half an hour and didn't bring it up again.  I told a couple other freinds and the rumor mill churned but no-one wanted to acknowlede it.  At one point my RA told me I was on the unofficial HS list. (homo-suspicion).  The thing is I am not at all effeminate or  ""gay-acting"" so I picked up pretty quick again that the rumor went around but no-one really wanted to acknowledge it out loud.  I told a gay friend and he got upset at me for being bi and not straight or gay.


****************************************************************

So with the way things have gone I was not very comfortable talking to my wife about it.  I made an occasional joke about giving out handjobs (its a long hilarious inside joke that I don't know if I can explain here) but never really talked about it.  At one point while we were dating I hinted kind of heavily and she asked if I was gay and instead of turning it into a conversation I just backed out.  So I a few times she tried to broach the subject and I played it off.  

So two nights ago during sex she asked me if I found men atractive and I told her if we weren't married I wouldn't have a problem having sex or a relationship with a man.  And she said as long as you don't cheat on me I don't care.  Best wife ever.

More accurate TL;DR Through a combination of awkwardness and other peoples attitudes coming out has always gone horribly wrong.  My wife handles this by coaxing me out of the closet just so she can tell me she doesn't care as long as I follow the same no cheating rules that apply to women.

I havn't felt so relaxed in my own skin maybe ever.

Well, that would be even more boring.

Here are some basic facts about us. I'm a professional, although she'll never admit it. The irony of me being bi and her being Greek is not lost on her. We have 3 great kids who drive us crazy.


Saturday:

6:30 am:
Baby crying. I'm the lighter sleeper between my wife and I. This means that I get up. I put a blanket on the baby and thankfully

7:00 am:
Multiple kids awake. Arrg!!! Our day has started. We make breakfast

9:00 am:
My oldest kid has swim practice. There's a skirmish about who has to drop her off. I win based on having blanketed the baby.

9:30 am:
Shower time. My two year old catches me trying to take a shower by myself. She gives me this look that declares her ownership of the shower and its usage. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Now

10:00 am
Pick up kid from swim practice.

11:00 am
Get horny. I signal this state of arousal to my wife. Only married couples with children can truly understand this barbaric behavior. I feel like a baboon female raising her ass in heat. Before children

11:05 am:
Thank God for Netflix and Dora the Explorer. We have timed sex and Dora only gives us 22 minutes. We run to the bedroom, I decide to finish strong. I slam her ass like there's no tomorrow. We both collapse into a sweaty pile of panting.

11:30 am:
Kids at the door

noon-5 pm:
Extended family barbeque. We eat and drink too much. Greeks are a very hospitable people. I try to help clean but my mother-in-law gives me too much grief to continue. I have also been impressed with the Greeks' confidence in their culture and customs. Many ethnic groups, my in-laws lack this need, but that's for another post. The only thing of note is that gay marriage does come up as a topic of discussion. The older generation is against it; the younger one for it, (big surprise here). They don't know I'm bi. Part of me feels guilty for not telling them. I think part of the problem is that too many of us are silent.

6 pm:
Make and eat dinner.

7-9 pm:
Read with kids. The oldest is amazing. She can read 2 years above her grade. The middle one is a stubborn donkey who refuses to learn his ABC's. Play with kids in back-yard. Put pajamas on kids and gear up for the bedtime war.

9 pm:
Read book or watch movie with wife.

11 pm:
Go to bed.

That's it folks. A day in the life of low-down

I identify as bi, it is like what ""trans*"" is for transgender and genderqueer individuals, it is inclusive of everyone who fits the broad definition. 

I know there are bisexuals who do find only men and women attractive and that's a totally valid identity that falls under the bi umbrella but in real life there is so much variety and 90% of the people I know who identify as bi are attracted to non-binary identities as well.  I have a friend who is genderqueer and they have a bi girlfriend and the girlfriend deals with bi invisibility all the time because when her partner is gendered as male on some days people call her straight and on other days when her partner is gendered as female she is considered gay.  Bisexuals deal with enough discrimination outside the community

If you assumed that someone who was bi was only attracted to cismen and ciswomen you would be wrong 95% of the time.  Yet people continue to say this to myself and others of the community.  It doesn't make any sense to me

I'm a bisexual female (and pretty damn attractive, and honestly, I don't care one way or another. It's as much of a part of who I am as having blue eyes or being 5'9"" is, but it's not who I *am*. I *am* an engineering student. I *am* a bad ass. I *am* a frakking witty motherfucker. Yes, I am bisexual, but it doesn't define me.  

So, because I have this fear of women taking the whole ""I'm sometimes attracted to women thing"" the wrong way and not wanting my company. And from then on, to most heterosexual men, all I am is a sex object. They make comments about threesomes, or ask for a recount of all of my experiences, and ask me for very detailed opinions of each woman in the room (moreso than my opinions on the men). It's like the moment they find out I have the ability to look past gender, I'm not even human in their eyes anymore--a walking fantasy or something. Just an anomaly to whom they can ask all sorts of invasive personal questions.  

I'm just frustrated

Cut to me hanging out with my best friend. I wanted to make reference to something I read here

I did.  She, but I don't think she really realized or thought about who I might fantasize about (hint, not her lol!)  To make a long story short, she used to date women as well, and we both realized the men we picked were unusually stereotypically feminine in some ways.  The perfect type of partner. 

So, who kept much of my life hidden from my family and friends, it was a relief to say it.  Yes I am bisexual.  No, that doesn't make me polyamorous. No, I am not someone trying to get attention.  Have I kissed women in bars?  In my youth, sure.  Just like kissing a man in a bar.  But I have also loved women deeply.  Shared relationships with them.  It was just so much easier to follow societies expectations and marry a man.  As is often said by gay men and women, why would someone choose to be an outcast in society?  Admittedly

So, I have nothing against people preferring to call themselves pan over bi, and I have nothing against individuals who are in fact only attracted to cis individuals, but it really rubs me the wrong way when people make such generalizing statements about who you can be attracted to if you're bi. 

When I started calling myself bi as a teen it wasn't because I'd realized that I liked people out of box A and out of box B but not anyone else

The thing is, and I find that rather silly. It has introduced a term, which some like and some dislike, but it has not introduced the occurrence to which the term refers. Therefor, I don't believe that the introduction of the new term (pansexuality) voids those definitions of the old term (bisexuality) which include attraction to non-cis individuals.

And before someone says ""but, and I think that would piss them off. 

I'm attracted to certain (physical and mental) traits. Some of these are more common in people identifying as female, I am attracted to that person, no matter their gender identity. I call myself bi because it was the first word I learned which seemed to fit me in this regard, because I see it used to encompass a variety of preferences including my own, because many people know about it, and because I've never seen a reason replace it with something else. Just because others might have a different definition or associations to the word, that doesn't make my definition wrong (nor, is it that uncommon a definition).

It was something that could potentially change how she felt about me forever. It was a terrifying thought

When we got home, and to be accepted as I am. I was still not looking for anything more than a monogamous loving relationship with her.

To say that she was shocked was an understatement. It was a long night with a lot of questions and tears and I felt terrible for the distress I had caused her. But even worse

The next day

I consider myself lucky to have a spouse as supportive as she has been. With her help I eventually was able to share this part of myself with the rest of my family and many of my friends. I have grown as a person because of her acceptance instead of hating a secret part of what makes me who I am.

It hasn't all been hugs and acceptance from people. I have had my share of bigotry from both straight and gay people. As somebody who considers themselves moral, this was a little hard to take at first. I have been called faggot by people I love, I have been told I am really gay by gay people that should know better, and I have been told I should not be proud of who I am.

1373192584.0,1hsp4f,In love with my [f]riend for 17 years. 36/married/mother. Confessions &amp; details of what happened and what I want to happen...,NOTaMaleRedditor,103,24,46,"I just feel like getting all of this off my chest in some fashion. I feel like writing it out will give me some release since I have been carrying these feelings for a very long time. Only two people know any of this (her and my husband) and I am tired of not discussing/acknowledging these feelings.  I don't care if anyone responds


I am 36, I have never cheated on my husband, and we are both very sexually compatible. I absolutely love sex with him, love him, love our life together, see us together forever, and all that jazz. But




When I was in 8th grade, I met my friend Jenn and we became instant best friends. We were inseparable until I left for college. 




High school together was a blast. We were girly girls together through-and-through. We were joined at the hip. We would have sleepovers and hang out all the time and we were both each others complete inner-circle of friends. We each had other friends -- many of the same -- but nobody was as tight as we were.



Jenn and I were always very flirtatious -- with guys...and with each other. But not so with any other girls. There was just a chemistry between us. We both knew it but never acted upon it.




Jenn has so many great attributes that I still love about her, she has an amazing body with a tiny waist and feminine hourglass hips, has a killer smile and can convey an entire conversation with just her eyes.  Her looks make me wet alone, and how she uses those eyes...how she peers through them.  Oh, and she has FANTASTIC breasts. I was always in awe of them. I loved seeing her in her bikini when we would sit around her pool. She would lay out for hours and I loved staring at her and those womanly breasts and tiny waist from behind my sunglasses. I think she always knew I was checking her out...as she seemed to coyly play it up, for my enjoyment. Her boobs have got to be cup size C or D. Mine are a small A (IF that) which is probably why I loved hers so much (since I felt like mine never 'came in'...and I still feel that way).  





She's overtly sexual in nature. In that 'Marilyn Monroe' sort of way...she just oozes sex. I love the match in prowess that I found in her.  She was the kind of girl that you would assume was very promiscuous, not that anyone would have ever assumed that.)  





Emotionally: I loved her attitude and her personality.  She was warm and kind and funny and has a great laugh. She also had a realness or depth to her friendship that always felt genuine. But she's also moody and a little bitchy/mildly stuck-up at times. I love that too. In fact, and break through that temperamental moody shell of an attitude, when it appeared. I liked the challenge. Personality-wise, we just clicked symbiotically.





The extent of our ""relationship"" throughout high school was nothing more than super-best-friends with an undertone of borderline wanting to take it to the next level but neither of us did or even dare mention it. The most that ever happened was flirtatious tickle fights or gifting each other girl-next-door-but-still-sexy nightgowns from Victoria's Secret. But I think deep inside, shyness, or insecurity that maybe one of us was reading into it more than the other.  



After graduation, including my attention -- that usually went to her. I missed her too. I loved seeing her when I would come home. Our reunions were always as if nothing changed. Our favorite movie was Threesome.





The summer after freshman year took her to Denver on an internship for the summer.  I don't know how it came about





She went out first and got an apartment and started her internship and I joined her a few weeks later. When I got to Denver, and we would have fun just being buds in our off hours. We would go shopping, to the movies, trek the mall scoping out hot guys...all the usual best friend stuff. I loved it. And so did she. She loved having me out there and my attention I gave to her. 






My favorite part was her studio apartment. Having no luxury of another room or even a den, but after years of being drawn to her, I was ecstatic to be by her side at night. Night after night.





It was after I had been there for only a few days when the change in our relationship was about to take place.  That summer was unusually hot or maybe we just weren't used to that dry heat. One night was almost unbearable and she didn't have A/C. We went to bed, and laid there. It was hot. I was hot. She was hot. We were both getting sweaty.  So the covers come off. Now we are laying side by side without the tacit barrier of even just a thin sheet separating us. We were both in skimpy nightgowns. I remember navy/white polka dots for her while I was in a hot pink short number she gave me a few years earlier.  (Which I still have, by the way.)  But it was still too much on our bodies.  I don't remember which of us did it first, but after a few minutes, our clothes came off...in the name of getting cooler, of course. I think I initiated it by taking mine off first. Naturally, I said something to blame it on the heat, my mind was racing with the possibility of how this could naturally progress and unfold.





Delicately, testing the boundaries of our friendship.





I remember finally settling into a ""comfortable"" position -- facing her, ""yes.""  So I did. I touched them. I caressed them. I squeezed them. I had never felt anything like them. No part of my own body had that texture. Her skin was smooth like a cross between satin and velvet. And they were soft.  Soft when I pushed them in, soft when I gently squeezed them, and had an alluring weight when I moved them. It seemed like they were filled with feathers from angels' wings. It was glorious. 





Then I made the next move. I sat up for a better vantage point and to be able to use both hands. I sat beside her and she softly moaned when I touched her. Her breathing started to get slightly deeper. I instantly knew this was an experience in which we both felt a great internal release that had been building over the years as illicit sexual tension. I caressed her breasts and moved to her torso. Gently rubbing her stomach and chest and encircling her breasts from nipple to side boob.  I enjoyed every portion of them.  Then I slowly lowered myself to kiss her body. I started around her neck and slowly moved down her décolletage.





I moved over her body cautiously -- giving her ample time to stop me at any point along the way.  I softly kissed my way back up from her stomach to her neck and lingered near her ear before slowly approaching her face. I asked her if this was ok and she responded, a-la the movie Pretty Woman. 




I longed to kiss her lips but totally respected her boundary. So, nibbled her nipples and gently sucked on different sections with my mouth. When I got close to her navel, I rubbed my hands on her stomach and down the outside of her thighs, returning upwards and teasing her on her inner thighs. I reached for her panties and slowly slid them down.  I could feel their wetness on my wrists as I took them off, which excited me even more.  I could hardly contain the excitement within me but was sure to go slow and enjoy each moment of a scenario that may never have the chance to play out again.





I lowered my lips to the mound between her legs and softly kissed her there. I breathed warmly as I passed over her clit and vulva, and lowered myself into position.  There I lay, rubbing her stomach, caressing her legs, softly kissing everywhere but THERE and gently breathing on her to silently announce I had arrived. She was moaning slightly and gently writhing. I descended my mouth to her clit and slipped out my tongue and took it into my mouth and ever so slightly sucked it and licked it. It was smooth and firm, erect with a tiny salute to pleasure. 





The sensation was surreal -- unlike anything I had ever felt on my mouth and uniquely distinct even to this day.  It didn't smell like mine but it was still 100% womanly. I was intrigued and my interest piqued even more. I moved my tongue around further and explored each fold and each lip. Her wetness mixed in my mouth. Even the juices were silky and I loved the taste of her.  I kissed and licked and nipped and then set in for a rhythm. I applied pressure to all the places I personally liked and consistently licked up and down.  I went faster and faster as her moaning increased and her breathing changed to a pant.  I alternated from time to time between a wide





I sat beside her lightly caressing her body and then asked her if that was ok...if she liked that. She said





The next morning and following days were normal just like every other day had been.  Almost as if it didn't happen. She started to get a little moody and I was getting busier at work and we suffered less time able to spend together after work.  After a few days



I made the decision that our friendship was suffering and told her I had made the decision to go back to New York.  She responded with more attitude and pulled away, ""don't expect our friendship to remain."" But we left it at that. I boarded the plane and we fell out of communication the rest of that summer. Perhaps she felt abandoned; perhaps I felt rejected.

 ANYWAY TO THE STORY:

Made an OKCupid account shortly after my girlfriend broke up with me, but last night I mentioned that I was going to a local bar to do some open mic and coincidentally he was going to the same bar for his friend of a friends 21st.

After having my fair share of drinks and playing some percussion on stage for a while he showed up and BOOM insta-connection. Now, there he is, a few inches taller than me, Italian-looking and muscular. So we hit it off, turns out we have a lot of the same interests and commonalities. After a while we go outside the bar for some quiet and fresh air and we just start making out in front of the bar! That was a lot of fun and pretty earth-shattering for me as this was what I consider to be my first time (I've been with a guy before, but I was much too intoxicated to have it matter to me).Later we got to his place and I slept over!! =] We messed around quite a bit, but I was mostly content with cuddling. =P

I have always identified as a straight male. From my earliest days on the playground all the way through high school and into university, and relationships exclusively with girls. Never did a guy ever turn me on.

At university I met a guy, and we became fast friends. He is a small dude, and presents fairly androgynous. He's a beautiful guy. He's gay, out-and-proud, and it didn't take long for us to become best friends. A couple years passed, and I got the sense that he had developed a crush on me. Sure enough, we sat down one day right before the beginning of our university's summer break and he admitted to me nervously that he had indeed developed feelings for me. His biggest fear, was not that I would turn him down -- he expected that -- it was that our friendship would be irreversibly damaged. 

I assured him that although I didn't share his interest

Almost.

I'll sound like a cad, but what really turns me on is the stomach and torso. I don't know what it is about a fit core, but it gets me going. Now, Theo's got a hell of a body, and fits just about every point on my ""type,"" with the exception of his gender. Smart, funny, conscientious, the list goes on.

That summer was spent doing a lot of thinking. It was a long summer. Introspection took up the majority of my time and it was exhausting. Eventually

Once university started up again

1356968343.0,15q5qa,Came out to myself today [m36].,kex,94,16,21,"I clearly and unequivocally admitted to myself today that I'm not straight.

I've been tucking this away in some corner of my brain for some time.  I saved pictures of MtF pre-ops having sex with other women and with men; sometimes I'd imagine I was the man, and even gay porn and become very aroused, but ultimately I would still tell myself I was straight.  

Rewind back a couple weeks ago

Last night, I found chaste devices which were typically used in BSDM circles.  So it eventually led me to come across a ""light BSDM"" discussion involving dom women and sub men. It was an inviting discussion and I've always had a thing for aggressive women, so I started to participate in the chat and playing along.  

I was really getting into it when she stunned me with a question: would I let another male sub have sex with me and give him oral sex?  At first I felt kind of strange, but I didn't want to disappoint her.  I've been in a Buddhist/animist mindset lately.  I realized it's just a  body part from another subby/femmy *human being*, so why get so hung up on it?  

She was so good at this, let's do this.  The moment I thought that, I instantly became aroused at the thought of giving pleasure to another man's penis.  I then thought ""would I really do this if I were in this woman's home/dungeon/etc and she asked me to?  My subconscious screamed back at me ""hell yes I would really go through with it"".

We played this out for a while

I think maybe she noticed I was ""playing it safe"" by justifying all of my behaviors as straight since I and her other male sub were playing feminine roles.  She asked if I'd have sex with one of her *manly* men to arouse her.  I felt a repeat of my emotions before

But this time, what was my holdup?  Some stupid arbitrary rules dictated by society?  

It was at this moment a breakthrough occurred, but I would do it to arouse and please this guy, this fellow human being as well.  Suddenly, I had faced the fact that I'm not straight.  And I immediately realized I'd been ignoring this truth for a decade.  

*Holy crap

And then there was a tidal wave of emotions, and that part was thanking me with a flood of emotions for finally being liberated.  I'm tearing up and getting choked up again just writing this.

Since I finally let myself be who I really am

I have no idea what I'm going to do next, but now I feel I must dig deeper and learn much more about a new part of my life.   I think 2013 is going to be an interesting year.

This past week I've had my place to myself and I decided to make a craigslist ad for casual gay sex.  Regardless of which gender, he was a relatively attractive, slightly stalky hispanic guy and we got right to it.  Even though his face was decent I really disliked kissing him, as I've never felt much of a desire to kiss a man.  When I went down I was amazed to see that his dick was mammoth sized (he claimed it was 9"").

As soon as we both finished was the only unpleasant thing.  He just kind of got his clothes on and got out which was all I wanted him to do.

However

If others want to buy new toys that's fine and really what bothered me was that some of the posts held the assumption that if you weren't buying a new toy each time that was wrong and if you couldn't afford to do that you were having too many partners.

&gt;I say if you're sleeping with enough girls to not be able to afford a strap-on for each then you're probably sleeping with too many girls at once.

Are we really going to have this sex-negative slut shaming from WITHIN the LGBT community?  We're supposed to be better then this.  I'm especially sad to see this from a group of people who is generally so supportive of queer sexuality and feminist thinking (sex-positivity was born out of the 3rd wave feminist movement).  

I just don't see how queer individuals can request and want there to be straight allies to the community and to want support for their lifestyles but then turn around and be so bigoted towards alternative sexual lifestyles.  I will support the individual right for someone to choose monogamy to the end but I do ask that others support my right to choose consensual non-monogamy.  

The non-monogamous/polyamorous community needs allies too

1331521403.0,qsdir,Does anyone here sometimes wish they were *just* homosexual?,,85,11,50,"I realize there's a post somewhat like this over in r/lgbt right now

I'm a bisexual female, I'd been repressing same-sex feelings, but since I had crushes on guys I assumed that I was normal, that all straight girls had the same sorts of feelings I did. In October of last year, things started changing for me. The more I read about the experiences of other on LGBTQetc oriented blogs, the more open I became to the idea that you can love anyone, regardless of their sex or gender. Around the same time, and I definitely responded to her. And even though I maintained that I was straight I was so attracted to her

Since then I've found myself increasingly attracted to women, how guys were allowed to have multiple partners but girls had to be the picture of Christian purity, etc. (I know that's all based on a very simplistic and stereotyped and kind of untrue view of the world; it's just how I felt very commonly when I was younger. Almost like I was being ""cheated"" out of a good relationship.) And I've been trying so hard to repress my heterosexual side, so much so that I occasionally feel like a closeted straight person, hah. It's awful and I wish I could stop forcing myself to be one thing or the other, but I'm terrible at dealing with being in-between anything. Not committing to one gender is difficult for me, mostly because of this mindset I just can't seem to shake.

I think another thing that gets me is I'm unable to be a part of any local LGBT community, and I feel like that would help me be able to ""cross over"" more, but right now I am so, so frustrated by not being able to rid myself of some residual attraction to men. When Cynthia Nixon's comments were getting such backlash all across r/lgbt, I found myself thinking that her comments mirrored my feelings so much, and that I wished I could do what she is doing--living as a lesbian. And if I lived in a different area, I would be. 

Hopefully someone else has had a similar experience or even just some words of wisdom would be nice. Sorry for the length :(

For those who may haven't heard the term beard before a beard is a person whose sole purpose is to keep up the appearance of heterosexuality for their partner. Some do this knowing what they're getting into others do not. I've also heard it applied to the girlfriends of closeted guys.

I've had friends of friends meet him for the first time and they go out of their way to warn me about their perception of his sexuality to keep me from getting hurt.

And then she messaged me. She was cute as could possibly be, too.

After meeting the other couple a few times

The game started slow by asking us about different sexual experiences we had and would like to have. After we went through all the survey and thought cards

Since we were playing this game as a stripping game, and they seemed to both be riding the same wave of pleasure ultimately culminating in their simultaneous orgasms.

Soon after this, they ended up ignoring the timer, and continuing until she reached an earth shattering orgasm. They then switched out, and my girlfriend had her first experience going down on another girl. Everyone was in agreement that this was the hottest point of the night. My girlfriend seemed like a pro. She was using her mouth and hands in ways that surprised even her. Ultimately she was able to bring herself and the other girl to climax multiple times.

At this point we all agreed that we needed a break. We sat and chatted for a little bit, and when they noticed the audience they had, they invited us over to help. When we crawled over there his girlfriend said ""let the bicurious fella' go first."" I then grabbed his eight inch dick, and started going to town. This being the first cock I ever sucked, I was surprised at how natural it seemed. I was making him moan while my girlfriend played with his balls, and his girlfriend sucked on his nipples. At some point my girlfriend had moved over and started giving her head while I was giving him head. Everyone was in pure bliss. At a moment when we both looked up we decided to switch out. I gave his girlfriend head while she sucked his dick. We then switched out once more until my girlfriend made his girlfriend cum yet again.

This time we took a longer break. Everyone decided to get something to drink and rest up for the final round. My girlfriend and I became impatient once again though and decided to just go ahead and start fucking. She was riding me hard when he walked back in the room and yelled for his girlfriend to come see this. They both came in and watched us fuck like rabbits. We told them they were welcome to join in if they wanted

After all the fun had been had

So now here I am, and the things I am looking forward to doing next time. My girlfriend and I talked a bit before she went to sleep, and we agreed that this ended up being a great decision for our relationship, and she too can't wait to do this again.

Hi, agender--I don't really know for sure.   I
don't have a firm understanding of what gender really *is*.  I was assigned a
gender at birth
gender.  For sure I hate my gender *role*; if I'd known 15 years ago what I
know now
closer to the other gender role.  But at this point in my life
to.

So with that in mind
complaint that a particular meaning of the word ""bisexual"" is erasing people
like me--that is
binary.

I am bisexual.  What I mean by that is that I could
to anyone.  Some people prefer to use ""pansexual"" to describe that.  Recently
I've been hearing quite a lot that my identity is wrong; people tell me that I'm
not bi
people who don't identify with the traditional gender binary.

I find this discomfiting
while ""pansexual"" leaves me cold.  That's not to say that people who do identify
as pan are wrong either

So why is ""bisexual"" problematic?  The common complaint seems to be that it
contains the word ""bi""
gender binary, it requires a scale of
""male"" to ""female"" that all people can be placed on
agendered people.

As far as that goes

Firstly
coined in an era when we only had a gender binary
expanded, do not know *anyone*
who uses ""bisexual"" to mean ""I am only attracted to people who are 100% male or
100% female""; which
exist
define a word based on its etymology is an [etymological fallacy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etymological_fallacy)
and ignores the *huge* changes which have taken place in discussion of sexuality
since the word first appeared.

Secondly
reinforcing the gender binary; what about ""gay"" and ""lesbian""?.  

I mostly present as my AAB gender; maybe I have some mannerisms or dress habits
which aren't prescribed by that gender role
meet could probably identify me as belonging to a particular gender.  So let's
say I begin a relationship with someone who identifies as a gay person of that
same gender.  ""Gay"" usually means ""attracted to the same sex or gender""; so is
that person erasing *my* identity by continuing to identify as ""gay""
though they're not the same gender as me?  Should I constantly remind them of
that
them to?

I've never heard anyone

I'll admit that when I realised I was bisexual
was a thing.  Would I have chosen to identify as pan if I had?  Honestly
don't know.  What I do know is that bisexuality has a long history
the literal meaning
beyond a simple sexual orientation.  I identify with people who have come before
me who identify as bisexual, who identify as bisexual.
I'm proudly bisexual; it's not just a word that describes who I fuck
of my identity.

Bisexuals already have to put up with criticisms that gay people don't: we can't
be faithful
either gender
to the opposite sex
either straight or gay and just can't admit it.

And now it seems we have another criticism: that we're reinforcing the gender
binary and gay or lesbian people somehow aren't.

Frankly
the gender binary
with it (or else come out as trans and stick with the other gender).  These
problems personally affect *me*; they stop me from being who I am.  Anyone who
knows me can attest that I'm all for tearing down our society and replacing it
with something that's friendly to queers

But you know
happening.  I'm not the one oppressing you; I'm not the person who thinks your
gender identity don't real
because of your gender

So stop telling me that my identity is wrong
that are holding *all* of us back -- genderqueers
lesbians

We are not looking for other romantic relationships as a couple or individually which is the defining characteristic of polyamory (many loves). I have no problem with polyamory but neither of us feel it is right for us.  We have been married a long time,a threesome, and are getting close with another bi couple as friends and sex partners for group experiences.  We like them and have a connection as friends, but don't plan to tell them how much we love them or have them move in with us. 

I am sharing this as a example of what a non poly form of non-monogamy looks like in a effort to broaden the language in r/bisexual and try to get people to stop referring to anything that isn't monogamy as polyamory.

My mom and I did not speak about the subject for two years.

I'm currently in a relationship with a fantastic man, but we are in a monogamous relationship and I don't want to screw things up with him, even if I have small crushes on other women.

I'm looking to gain others' perspectives on my thoughts, and spark some respectful conversation.",fearfulofangrymob,88,52, but plan on replying to many more throughout the day.  I want to provide quality discussion

**NOTE:** I actually wrote this up under my real account

This seems like an overarching lgbt issue, so I decided I'd rather have this conversation here.

First and foremost, I've been lucky enough to have always been accepted for who I am, and while I have close friends that are not as lucky, I am first-hand ignorant in terms of bashing in regards to sexual orientation.

I'm sure what I'm asking about is a larger psychological topic than anything, so I apologize if this topic has been beaten into the ground.

 =====

I'm bothered by how some members of our community segregate themselves.  I'm bothered by how some members of our community never seem to venture out of their comfort zone of LGBT friend, and shout about being proud to be queer, as opposed to being proud to be human.

I'm worried that progress will never actually be made if we don't stop waving our banner and attempting to stick out as different than everyone else

 =====

I understand being more comfortable around people who have gone through the same thing as you.  But

 =====

When I was in college, they theme it like any old dance.  Go with a Hawaiin theme for all I care.  Just put on a ""fun"" themed dance instead of a ""gay"" themed dance.  Then, when uneducated bigots show up and have a problem with same sex couples dancing together, they would be in the minority.  They would see that it's not actually the end of the world.  Maybe they'd learn that ""oh, this dance was put on by the LGBT group?  That's cool of them.""  Maybe we could teach people who are uneducated about LGBT persons that yes... as humans we are all just one in the same... we're just attracted to different people.

But it didn't happen that way.  They put on ""PROUD PROM.""  Everything was rainbows and purple and sparkles and every bad stereotype imaginable.  They didn't crown a king and queen

And maybe that was the point.  Maybe they wanted straight people to feel unwelcome.  Maybe they wanted them to know what it felt like to be alienated based on sexual orientation -- but I really don't think that's the mentality any of us should have.  Yes

 =====

I've never been bashed for my sexuality.  I always considered myself straight, and am fortunate enough to be able to marry her this summer.

I'm bisexual.  I always have been, but it's not really anything to be ""proud"" of.  I mean, it's not like I'm better than straight or gay people.  It's just the way I am.  Sexuality shouldn't be something to be ""proud"" of.  It's just that -- your sexuality.  No big deal.

I'm sure my vision of this is skewed because I haven't been bashed.  I haven't been bullied into a corner of a safe space surrounded by only LGBT community members.  *I don't know what that's like.*  But even for those of you have that have been tragically tormented, who just happens to be attracted to guys, girls, or both.

 =====

I'm not trying to attack anyone.  Not trying to be hurtful in any way.  I'd appreciate any conversation to be done in a respectful tone.  I'm not looking to pick a fight -- merely trying to gain a different perspective on my opinion.

I did want to start a thread for anyone wanting to talk about other issues that pertain to being bisexual, but that comes with a whole host of specific Q and A's that I feel stunts dialogue that I'm trying to engage in, with it often ending with ""Oh, so you're basically bi...""

I'm also upset at the oversexualization of bisexuals, but it definitely doesn't mean that we're attracted to any person of any gender walking down the street. And everybody, I'm sure you've heard your fair share of threesome and kink comments when telling people you're bisexual. (Not to say that's not fun, of course. Just that it's not core to our sexuality.)

All of this treatment seems unfair to me, you poor little bisexual girl... Must be real rough for you."" Well, sometimes it is. True, we have the option of having a heteronormative relationship, but we don't see that as an ""option"". We love who we love, and that's about the end of it. It's difficult to wade through all of this without the support of either the straight community, or the gay community. I think that's a big reason why so many people end up here, or trying to define ""what"" they are

Anyway, and I care deeply about the LGBTQ community. Dialogue is good, regardless, so I do hope that this thread produces some of that.

I work in a field where we are trained on the appropriate vernacular, specifically gay men, hold a strong sense of resentment and sometimes even hate towards men that are bisexual. This is thought to stem from the ability to be more socially accepted as they can ""blend"" in as a heterosexual and dabble in homosexual tendencies as they please with less stigma than if they were solely homosexual.

I am bisexual myself and although I was aware of this phenomenon, but I am sexually and emotionally aroused by women as well. His argument was ""how do you know you're bisexual if you've never been with a girl?"" Which is absurd; it got really messy and I just stopped trying to explain myself.

Basically, and tonight I was hoping to have a wonderful time with guy number 3. I had suspected he was gay since I met him, and tonight at the club we both got drunk and he invited me back to his room. I had never had a straight-up hook up before, so I thought why the hell not.  However, on the way back to campus he asked that I enter the dorm 5 minutes after him, so I started having misgivings about this whole thing (I assumed he was out).  

When we get to his flat, he can't find an a-hole to save his life. I still like him, and prefer hand jobs and blow jobs anyway, so I ask if he would prefer that. I get a flat out no. I'm ok with that, I don't have to orgasm for a good time, but I do like things like kissing and caressing. None of that either! After he realises he's not going to get off from fucking me (he was mostly thrusting into the bed anyway), he demands that I fuck him. I tell him that I Can't (I REALLY don't like topping, so I am trying to subtly avoid a more embarrassing hook up). He then says ""If your going to be gay

Hold the fuck up. You have never topped before, I like hand jobs and oral, and I like intimacy. None of which I am getting here. And after making all these accommodations for him, he can't take the hint that there are THINGS THAT I DON""T LIKE TOO.  Basically, that killed my boner long before his ass did.

So I respond, he proceeded to instantly put his pants on, jump out of bed, and try to tell me to ""find myself"" and help me determine which sex I prefer (basically, everything that I had already been thinking about since I was 12). Given that he was drunk, he ended up talking in circles, ""You like to receive, but you give it to girls

When it comes to romance and sexual relations, but sort of as a support network that often times develops deeper understandings of one another.

On May 31st I got a message from David on Ok Cupid. We started talking and he was very nice, to be in love and to be loved. Over the week we talked, even staying up until 1am just texting each other. I quickly realized I was starting to like him, I told E that I met someone I want to see where things went which he completely understood. 

David &amp; I made plans to meet at Olive Garden for lunch on Saturday the 9th &amp; to play Pokemon since we both love video games. Saturday we meet &amp; hit things off really well! I'm going to try &amp; be as not share to much detail here

More cuddling and talking lead us to the couch again where he gave me the most mind blowing earth shattering bj I've ever experienced! Then I got to reciprocate the favor &amp; I really enjoyed myself doing it :) After more cuddling &amp; talking we showered together then went out as so we wouldn't just be making out all night. We went to dinner at Ruby Tuesday before going to the fair. First ride we went on was damn near terrifying &amp; I found myself holding his hand despite saying how I'm not into PDA (mainly since I know how society views same sex couples). After that we went on the tilt-a-whirl which left him dizzy for the rest of the night

Finally the night ended with us back at his place to play Super Smash Bros. Brawl before watching Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along-Blog since he's never seen it despite his love for Joss Whedon :) unfortunately I had work in the morning other wise I would of spent the night.

That's where the [f]riend comes in.

I was just like, BULLSHIT LOL! How could you know when I wasn't completely sure until pretty recently, but she swears she could tell, lol. Anyway we had a great talk and she was super supportive. I told her the story about my last gf and about my OKCupid account and everything. It felt so nice to be able to talk about it out loud and so casually with someone. She helped ease my worries about the reaction I might get from girls I date in the future, and she even mentioned (I think only half joking) about us having a 3-way with another guy

For the longest part of my life I lived like any other teenager guy.

Played the “popularity contest” for a couple years. Been with girls. Made fun of that one openly bi girl we had. Never even thought about the possibility of not being like everybody else. It was “weird”. I didn’t want to be weird. I wanted to be accepted. Just like most teenagers.

When i got into what americans would call High School i had a change of heart. Said to myself to screw that shitty popularity contest. I don’t give a shit what people my age think about me anymore.

That bi girl i mentioned earlier? We became kind of friends. (Middle and high schools are in the same school here.)

Talking to her also kinda opened my eyes. For the longest time i considered everybody who was not straight to be weird. It’s not my mums fault. She always raised me to be tolerant. It was school that turned me into an asshole.

Now i realized

Still

A while ago a good friend of mine came out to me by accident. He posted a link to a project he was working on here on reddit and showed me. I noticed the username was different from what he usually posts under. Turns out i found his “real life” account. I discovered that he is bi. No big deal for me. We talked a bit about it and then went back to talking about games

One thing that caused for me though was that it forced me to really think about who I am.

It’s a question that we ask ourselves our whole lives

There is one thing I know for sure though.

Thinking about everything I realized one thing. Everytime I thought I might like another guy more than just as friends i started distancing myself from them.

Was it a conscious decision? I’m not sure. Maybe it was a mixture of conscious and subconscious.

After sitting in my room with the doors locked and music on full volume i eventually came to terms with the fact that I am actually attracted to guys. And girls. I cried for whatever reason.

And that ladies and gentlemen is how i realized for myself

And you know what? It’s awesome now that I’m cool with it! I get twice the enjoyment out of seeing an attractive couple make out! :D

I’m writing this unneccesarily long text for you guys because this is the only thing i have enough balls for.

The girl and me

I don’t know who to tell

My mum always told me she would love me no matter what kind of person i might turn out to be. Still

See

What I’m afraid of is losing the few people that really seem to care about me. I know some of you will probably laugh at that

Maybe I just need some friendly encouragement. But there is nobody I can get that from

I don’t blame anyone for not actually reading all of this by the way. I mean it’s quite the wall of text. But to those few that do: Thank you.

Also: Thank you T. and A. for helping me come to terms with myself. If you happen to read this by chance you know who this is. You both know enough about me to recognize me.

Both of you are awesome. Trust me.

So are all of you here. Reading all those posts here gave me the balls to at least tell you guys.

Now that this is out of the way I feel like I'm one piece closer to figuring out the ever-growing puzzle that is myself.

As we know, or not acting on a thing for blondes when you are with a brunette. 

Where I differ with some here is in the defense of monogamy as the ideal in defending bisexuality. While I think that monogamy can be right for some to strive for or achieve, and people living in passionless marriages.

I think that perhaps the reason that bi's get pegged as being less monogamous than straights is that on average

I lived in a monogamous marriage for 20 years and experienced first hand how defining a relationship first and foremost by sexual exclusivity led to a marriage that was successful by that standard while failing at openness, bitterness and resentment.  In my experience, it was only after developing a sex positive attitude, accepting my wants and desires, and fully opening up to my spouse did we come closer together than ever before and have what is a truly successful marriage; ironically as we dropped the requirement of sexual exclusiveness. Having sex with other people (together as a couple) made us happier, more fulfilled and brought us closer together. 

I am not saying to not be monogamous

tl;dr: my wife and I gave up monogamy as the defining ideal of our marriage

My feelings as the date approached were a roller coaster.

I didn't even feel a sexual attraction . . . despite all the hot fantasies I've had about men, when I was actually in the presence of another man with the potential to act on those fantasies, the desires were definitely absent. He was a nice, attractive guy who paid for dinner. He did it all right. I just wasn't into him.

In a way, but I'm just as definitely not biromantic and seem to have no urging to engage in sex acts with other guys. I just like to fantasize about that. My next step: I've purchased some sex toys.

A couple of times I arranged this and another it just sort of happened spontaneously. I've struggled with this a bit, mainly because I haven't told her anything about it.

I came out as bisexual to my mom when I was 15/16.  I'm 25 right now.  My mom is a catholic and prudish and has always been super-awkward about my sexuality.  I, I'm cool with that, and it's just kinda...fuck the world if they think differently.

My mom recently remarried.  So, I just went out for drinks with that stepsister and we had a nice long chat about what we've been told about each other, among other things.  Because my mom likes to project the 'perfect family' image, I assumed that she never said a word about my sexuality.  I brought it up to the stepsister, who said she doesn't care (""My best friend's a lesbian..whatever"").  But then she said, ""When your mom was talking about she was like 'yeah, he says he's bisexual,"" and then

Fuck. that. shit.  I'm so, acutally.  She gives him a small pop on the mouth or spanks him when he's acting up, but nothing abusive.  So, currently we have this weird agreement that neither of us is going to bring this up because my mom's a passive-agressive, Catholic-guilt-trip kind of woman.

But what the fuck?  She's telling people I'm secretly gay, so I spend time at home from time to time and, while I've been here a few weeks, I'm leaving in 4 days on another assignment.  Do I say something?  Let it be?  I'm so, so pissed right now (as is my stepsister, honestly).  I just don't know what good would come of us confronting her about it.

EDIT/UPDATE - After having our discussion (which you can see below), apologizing, saying ""it's my own stupidity.  I shouldn't have said it.""

1362934106.0,1a11z0,17 year-old boy -- I think I'm bisexual ,MySoulAches,60,7,24,"Hey everyone ! I'm basically pouring my heart out here

My name is Ty

I'm a senior in high school

I really don't know where to start. So I guess I'll start with me over the years. Up until a few months ago, video-games, nice cars ... girls. 

And I still like sports like football, both physically and emotionally. Please keep this in mind as you read, because I will seldom mention them in this. 

But as I've grown up, I love ""Edgy Teen Stories""(as B&amp;N would say) that make me emotional and cry -- but also a lot of things that straight boys usually wouldn't be in to. 

For example, and that is really important to my self-discovery. I have probably hundreds of pictures on my iPad of male models that I love to just look at. And the range of modeling is quite wide. Like sometimes I like stuff like Burberry, and others like GQ. I love the artsy stuff - but it really just depends on the guy I'm looking at. I'm not into modeling that emphasizes like abs or being ripped, so I'm not into Channing Tatum, who is a rather handsome man that I would nevertheless NEVER kiss. That type of modeling is stupid to me.

 I love things that deal with the complexity of the face, my main attraction, and most of them I would do near anything with.. This desire seemed to just come out of nowhere, but its definitely here.(It hit me around 16 or so when I saw a picture of a younger Leonardo DiCaprio, who is certainly on that list of boys, and felt some weird unknown physical attraction to it.) 

Anyway, and talked, that he was certainly gay. But very introvertive  about it because my school is very homophobic, and I've been hearing that school kids bully him about it. 

But this boy

He is very androgynous, and from what I can tell he's on the skinnier side, but probably not bone skinny. He wears super stylish clothes that I love, and I'm sorry his eyes are so deep and black that the few times we talked, I couldn't even look into them cause my heart was POUNDING! Its weird because in the right light his skin will look light tan/bronze, and sometimes he will look kind of pale. But he always looks so beautiful. When I'm around him, I just feel nervous and I get the butterflies like crazy. I would do ANYTHING in the world to kiss him -- but I can't because I'm overly-shy, I physically could not tell him out of the blue that I'm bi . It would have to be during like deep conversation or something. I am trying to think of ways I could spur that with him

Anyway, I am still attracted to girls -- many more than boys -- but the boys I am attracted to are like irresistible magnets. There are some boys I would choose even over the prettiest girls. And not just in a physical sense. 

When I look at who I am, I want to hug him and tell him to ignore all the people that make fun of him for being himself. I'm sorry, typing this is  getting me into tears because this part of me wants all of these things so bad it almost hurts, because at the same time I feel there is some remnant part of me that is scared, and repulsive towards all of these things. 
I'll up late in my bed
""Why are you so fucking weird?""
""Are you seriously a faggot?"" 

I know, but seriously it's like another part of me that would love to push away all of my new desires. I feel it now, as I'm typing this in my room, and it almost makes me want to think that all of my desire is fake. A phase that will pass. But nothing in the world would hurt more. I love my new desires, I love loving boys, I love being able to see the beauty in the shape of a girl, and a boy. I really have never loved anything more than this new ""me"". If I wake up someday and I'm back to the same old me who would hate all of these new things I'm into. It feels right. It feels great, I go to my crush's Facebook and look at pictures of him or any other attractive body for that matter

Like I said before, nevertheless. 

And that is another thing. Sometimes I feel like I am lying to myself because I am attracted to androgynous types. But the thing is I am still fully aware that they are boys, I am deeply attracted to girls that have distinct boy features. I don't know if bisexual is the term to use for me, because only a slim amount of the boys out there are androgynous. But I would do everything with them that I would do with a girl. Emotionally, however, I would much rather involve myself emotionally with a boy. 

Am I bisexual
I want the former to be true

As of now, or watching a film -- writing or doing something that sparks my interest. I've been asked out plenty times, and my football guys are always weirded out that I don't have one because I guess they consider me a handsome guy(I hate complimenting myself about anything). 

I have never done anything with a boy

Anyway
Please tell me what you guys think about me! Anything! I'll be checking this post periodically over the day and I aspire to become a member of this community! This is my first step.

Thanks =)

This being the principle place I come for sexuality talk

I'm a bloke, a long time coming, and it was terrible. 

For a bit of context

So I'm with this guy and things are going swimmingly, I feel lovely making out and being handsy. It was kinda determined ahead of time that I'd be receiving, that's what I wanted because it's what I hadn't yet had with girls.

The moment comes and I can feel virtually nothing. I feel full is about the extent of it. The momentum of the night comes to a thundering halt. Even with a decent vibrator on hand I get nothing out of a prostate massage. We had to stop and because I was still pent up and needed to orgasm I had to put on straight porn to get me there. It was humiliating.

I haven't heard from the guy in the days since and I can hardly blame him. That's fine I don't really care but the whole situation has been swirling around in my head since. I imagine that if I bothered to continue with gay relationships

I actually feel less attracted to guys and for the first time in ages

I feel humiliated but I'm not one to be rash so I really want some other voices in my giving some contrasting views on how I should feel and what maybe I should do.

* Stares at attractive women when we are out 
* Gets off(extremely) on threesome porn especially when it begins to focus on the female on female play (we watch together sometimes)
* Has told me stories of how she used to play with herself when she was younger to girls in bikinis 
* Once I asked her very casually if she had an interest in girls too and she said no right away. I dropped the subject but then a week later she approached me and wanted to be held and cried a little told me she just wanted to let me know she doesn't think she is but she has some 'weird' feelings about it. I told her not to worry and not stress about it right now and she could always talk to me whenever she wants.

I am asking for advice today because recently she has told me about a girl in one of her classes that playfully spanked her butt. The convo turned into her wondering if the girl was bi or a lesbian or what not. She has brought up this girl by saying ""You remember that girl that I told you spanked my butt? [new thing about her]"" about 3 more times and its only been 2 weeks. We have been together about 4 and half years now so I know her pretty well and I can tell something has sparked her interest here. 

What should I do? I know she can be emotional about the subject so I don't want to ask again just out of the blue or anything like that. Should I continue to just let it be? The last time I have mentioned anything was about six months ago. 

Also for what it is worth I am not rock solid on the whole monogamy thing under the specific situation where one of us was bisexual.

1373836180.0,1iaofv,Discovering my bisexuality and no long associating my molestation with homosexuality. Nsfw,Batnips,60,11,7,"Edit: title should say ""no longer"". 
This is my long story that ends with me finally accepting my bisexuality
The hints:
Through the years there have been numerous hints. When I was younger I remember watching a real sex and it was the homosexual side of the porn industry and two guys were kissing I immediately turned away. Dismissing the way it made me tingle as disgust. Being raised Texas baptist in a small town by good ole' boys, and I was a lot bigger at this point(spent five hours a day in the gym, meat head style big). Well the crowd was pushing us against the barricade and I used every ounce of my strength pushing against the barricade so I didn't crush the guy. Some point during the night he started bouncing his ass against my crouch making sex moans and faces. Actually kinda hot. But I remember thinking I would fuck the shit out of you. I was aroused, because I was half brain dead when I realized my buddies right next to me were like WTF. I just gave my friends a ""psh, this guy gesture"" and went back to the show. Brushed it off and forgot about it for a long time. Then when making out with other guys was the cool thing to do(my chemical romance and the used guys started the trend my junior or senior year). There was this guy I want to make out with, but I confided this to a friend and she set up a ""lets determine if your gay make out session "" with this guy I was not attracted to and just wasn't past all my own bullshit yet. Couldn't do it. There are many other hints but these come to mind.

The incident:
Well I put it all behind me, while identifying as straight. I flirted over the top with the guys though so it was obvious I wasn't truly interested(or so I thought) but while letting them know I appreciate it. Well I was at a party with all my coworkers and I get followed in to a dark bathroom and pushed against a wall and start getting a blow job. Feels amazing then I ask ""what are you doing?"". A mans voice shooshes me, and I know exactly who it is and I had no attraction to him. I freak out, I was insanely drunk and tried to push him away, but my pushes had no strength. It was like the nightmare where when you punch somebody with all your might but they land like pillows. I go fetal trying to cover my self and crying, but the guy continues and just pushes my arms out of the way. I don't understand what is going through this guys mind because I'm limp and he actually picks me up and manages to get me on his back and tries to get me to fuck him. At this point I realize he thinks I want this. So I tell him not without a condom, and he put me down and I attempt to go fetal again. I finish and I'm crying and plead for him not to tell anyone. Call a friend to pick me up. (The fact that I came actually confused me for so long, not me. I was questioning at this period i didn't get to eased in to my intimacy with men. I was thrown into the deep end by this asshole and he made it something dirty)

Dealing with the incident:
I spend a week in bed depressed going to school and putting on a happy front. I contemplated suicide every day while just laying there in bed, he'll tell every one we know. I told him that I've thought about killing my self and he just told me I was fine with it up until he decided to tell people, that he doesn't care if I'm suicidal. I tell him forget it. I decided to kill him. I quit that job, got away from the guy and planned his death for years. I still don't know if I would have done it. But I had it planned out in exact detail if the opportunity arose. Patience was my greatest weapon, I was ready to kill him because he took my will to live so i was justified in taking his life. I didn't even know the guys last name and refused to because I was afraid of what would happen because that would make him to easy to find. This goes on for two or three years. I have a girl friend, brake up with her cause I have to bang chicks and prove to my self I'm a man. A few emotionless hookups and burnt bridges later After a lot of soul searching I realized I truly loved the girl I broke up with. We get back together. We were church going, and at a revival one Sunday. One of those days you're over whelmed and they called us to lay down the thing we've been carrying for so long. To lay it at the alter, for three years, let it go, ended up having to pull over I was so overwhelmed. Because I had heard through friends that the guy who had molested me had tried it on other straight men we worked with. I realized this man was obsessed with something he couldn't have so he would attack straight men and he truly believed they wanted it. My attacker that had weakened me to nothingness and that i had believed had strength over me was reduced to truly pathetic nothingness. That mans story saved my life

Life after coming to terms with what happened to me:
 I'm in a committed relationship with a beautiful women. But at 23-24 I figured the questioning should be over by now if I truly had no interest. The hints were weighing on my mind and the no longer looming association between molestation and homosexuality allowed me to no longer be closed to that part of my self. So I decided that I would watch gay porn. I wouldn't turn away, if I liked it fine and I would explore this part of my self. Truth Is I loved it. Not so much the rough stuff. I just happened to stumble upon some very intimate stuff. Kissing, and cuddling mostly and just gentle and loving. It made my whole body tingle like I was a little kid that got his first kiss. I thought it was beautiful. I've since realized that I had some deep imbedded self hating homophobia from my upbringing. Not intentional from my parents it was just how they were raised. when I let my self accept who I truly was the homophobia just sloughed off. little by little they were revealed and I was just able to move past them. Like before when I saw things on a guy that I found attractive I'd look away almost immediately Not allowing it to register as attraction, not anymore. Or shaking off homosexual day dreams or thoughts as something that just happened and I had to dismiss, but wouldn't do with straight day dreams.

Today: I now know who I truly am and I am discovering further each and every day. Even typing this out things were revealed to me. Favorite thing, and finding out every day more and more that even if I were in a relationship with a man, that it would be ok too. I've only come out to my brother, who was extremely supportive, I'm debating on coming out to my girl friend who I plan on marrying, but I'm very afraid of losing her. Any advise there would be great. I am equally attracted to men and women, and could see my self in an intimate relationship with either, and this is my coming out story to reddit under my new name.

So. Me(17/m), about two years ago. We went to one of his friends' house, someone I'm supposed to remember from when I was 3, you know how parents are. Introductions happened, as boringly as they do, then her son came out to say hi.

A year younger than me, playing board games, having laughs, enjoying the day; much more than I'd expected to. Then my dad asked when they were next to free to catch up again. My breath caught, aching to know when I'd see this gorgeous piece of sex again. John's mother  (Yeah my dad's friend was a chick, realised I didn't really mention that earlier, CBF editing) regretfully told us that they were going on a week long camping trip in a couple of days, as my father and I had no plans for the entire holiday, excitedly agreed.

Fast forward two days, sleeping bags, fishing rods, supplies; as you do. We arrived at John's house, bundled our stuff into their 4WD and off we went. An uneventful drive ensued, only to have us arrive at a caravan park... I was disappointed in the sense that that is in NO WAY a camping trip, but I got to spend time with John

That night, monotonous drive. We, perhaps fortunately, only had one bottle of shampoo between us. When the time came for him to use it, I peeked my head under the partition between cubicles to pass it to him. Seeing him naked seem to shock him at first, but seeing his glorious body, I couldn't resist sliding my way under the partition.

He'd relaxed by the time I stood up, began fondling each other, rubbing, jerking each other off. Soon, horny as bush of roses, I dropped to my knees and began blowing him. The feeling of his rock hard dick in my mouth, coupled with his stifled moans had me reeling with elation and pleasure. Eventually he pulled out and dropped down onto me, swapping about blowing each other until we both climaxed on each other

Without a word I slid back into my shower, dressing, and we both left the showers, straight-faced, as if nothing had happened. We dodged our parents' curious questions, saying the showers had good water pressure and such. We never talked about it, never mentioned it, it happened again and again every night for that camping trip.

Best week of my life.

For those who are bisexual and desire nothing more than a monogamous commitment, and from all sides. I do not think that non-monogamy is for everyone, and I don't believe that bisexuals are by nature any less monogamous than mono-sexuals, actually I think that for the majority of all people monogamy is difficult.

My bisexuality and non-monogamy are linked, and living my life to what others expected me to be, I finally cracked and came out the other side a better person embracing the reality that I am bisexual, kinky, and needing a deep intimate connections and sexual variety with more than one person. It was a terrible struggle to then tell these things to my wife who saw me as the vanilla, conventional person I lived my life trying to be - and was shocked by this revelation. This led her to a lot of thinking, an attempt to understand how I could say these things and still love her and want to be with her, she realized that she was also curious as to what was out there, in our case shared as a couple.

While negative stereotypes do suck, and that bisexuals are just as capable of a lifelong monogamous commitment as a monosexual person; though in general we all, regardless of our sexuality suck at monogamy given enough time (as evidenced by rates of cheating, misery and divorce). 

The linkage is not in an inability to be monogamous as much as it has to do with what it means to be honest with yourself about who you are sexually and what you need to be happy. When one confronts societal pressures to conform and stands up to proclaim themselves to be other than straight - it is a big deal and difficult to do. When one takes that giant step and throws off conformity in one aspect of their life to embrace who they are sexually, and bisexuality and non-monogamy (for the record, I am all of these things). 

My non-monogamy does not affect your monogamy; that bigots may assume you aren't capable of non-monogamy is the fault of the bigots and not mine. I am just trying to live my life without shame.

I would like to add that I had a monogamous commitment with my wife for more than 20 years before arriving at non-monogamy. I was successful at monogamy, and neither did she. We did it perfectly and we were miserable for many of those years; sexually unsatisfied, not honest about our needs and desires, and almost divorced as a result before opening up about who we really are - a trait which should be held as more important than sexual exclusivity in defining a successful relationship. I would further add that many of the people (bi, straight or gay) upset about people being non-monogamous have not made a successful long term commitment to monogamy, instead practicing serial monogamy, being exclusive to ne person months or a few years at a time - a very different thing than being exclusive to one person for a lifetime commitment. I can tell you that in my first five years of marriage I would not have understood how one can be committed and non-monogamous and likely couldn't of transitioned our relationship successfully

I've been bi and known it since the moment I hit puberty

In high school I used to hang out with many friends, or gay.  I even had a few fumbling nights with a gay friend.  

But when I met the girl who later became my wife, I didn't think it was all that important to tell her.  But mostly - I was scared.  Scared that she'd leave me.  So it went unsaid, and after the kids came along, and a whole lot of years had gone by, it seemed like it was ""too late"" to say anything.  

I agonized about this here
http://www.reddit.com/r/bisexual/comments/w279w/intro_somewhat_confessional/

Despite the supportive comments on that post (and one snippy one)

Last Friday, and we were talking about the usual stuff.  It was a very good mood.  So, I screwed up my courage, and... almost chickened out again.  But, I said to myself ""if not now, when?""

The initial words were easy... and tremendously difficult.  ""So there's something I wanted to talk about... no it's not bad...  um... did you ever know

...

...

...  

The silence was getting painful.

Then she got upset.  ""What is this? Why are you telling me this?  Why now - what do you want?""

""I just need to live in truth.""

""Why now?  Why are you just telling me now?""  Silence.  Hurt look.

""I should have told you 30 years ago.  I'm sorry.  I was a coward about this, and that would just break me.""

""What else?  You've lied about this all this time?  What else are you lying about?  When's the other shoe going to drop?  Is this leading up to something else?""

""No.  In all our time together, no more than you have.  I just couldn't bring myself to tell you this one thing about me.""

""You say that

""Nothing.  Really.  I know this is a shock

Silence.

More silence.  

""Why didn't you tell me.  You didn't trust me

At this point I really began to regret that I had said anything.  She was in pain. I was in pain.  And I could have stayed silent on this subject.  No, not forever.  But part of me was wishing I'd kept my mouth shut.  I said ""Well, I could have taken this to the grave with me, would that have been better?

""NO!  You should have just said something sooner.  Both are bad - knowing

""I can only say, and never have given you cause for suspicion.  We've had each others' back for a very long time.  I love you more than anyone else in the world - aside from the kids, of course - and without you I'd be broken.  I understand why you are angry, it was only fear on my part, and I'm sorry.""

I'm not going to type the entire discussion.  The gist: the bisexuality didn't bother her (at least after the initial shock)

Somehow, but also heavy on David Bowie, Roxy Music, Bryan Ferry; and so many hours of Joni Mitchell, Alison Krauss, other moody female singers.  And she knew that my previous GF was bi, and that I had bi/gay friends. But apparently she had no idea.

I should add that our oldest daughter came out as bi a couple of years ago

So this has been a very long weekend.  A bit of discussion, but everything changes with time, and we weren't always addressing some of the distances that had crept in between us.

This morning, but that she was still hurt that I didn't trust her enough to say something years ago.  And I again said that she *should* be hurt by that, and that I am truly sorry. 

It's been hard

I see quite a few people here asking if they should tell their significant other about their sexuality.  I can only say

anyway, and this has been a recurring theme for a few years now.  Among a shitload of other problems and questions I have regarding sexuality (that I may or may not work up the courage to type out in the future) one thing that I can't get away from is how much I would rather have sex as a woman, with both sexes.  I mean I'm happy being a guy, and having straight and gay sex are both great (or so I hear) but there's something far more erotic to me about having sex with a man as a female, and something far more sensual/sexy/not creepy about doing it with a woman as a girl. I say not creepy, because although I find women attractive (far more attractive, aesthetically, maybe it's just a self esteem thing or a result of having absolutely no experience but I can't even imagine a way to go about it without feeling strange.

There's always controversy over whether oral and manual sex are considered ""sex"" or if sex is limited to penetrative vaginal or anal sex only.  As a pansexual woman this always frustrates me since oral **sex** and manual **sex** have always been mainstays of my sexuality and they are just as special and real to me no matter what the gender of the individual I'm with happens to be.  

I resent the view that non-penetrative sex doesn't count because it basically implies that the sex I experience with women isn't real and only the sex I have with men is real.  It even limits the sexuality I've had with men too.  I consider my sexual debut to have begun with manual sex at 16 and for me I found that the non-penetrative sex I enjoyed between then and when I actually had piv sex the first time at 21 was just as special and real as the penetrative sex I have now.

Last year, but I was just so apprehensive with experimenting with the same sex.  It was so incredible.  I have slowly been more open with my roommate, in small small ways.  I owe him the respect of telling him that he is living with a bisexual.  The biggest tip off, was that he witnessed the walk of shame that my best friend had last year.  He thought it was a one time thing, I was kind of drunk, so he just brushed it off.   Slowly I have been dropping more hints, like putting [this](http://i2.listal.com/image/680144/600full-marlon-brando.jpg) as my phone background

I know he knows, is that I could imagine myself in both of their positions. This is the first time that happened with anything. I have never imagined being so open with another guy, and to be honest I have never been that open with a girl, either.  I know it is just a movie, but I know that one day I can, and will do something very similar with a girl or boy I like.

Both mom and dad pretty much said, ""Yeah, I figured."" Apparently it's common for you straight people that are close to us bisexuals to have some idea before we tell you, or even before we realize it ourselves. Still, it's a HUGE deal to us. We wrestle with wanting it to ""go away"", with being in denial, and the need to be honest with those closest to us. Pros of coming out: Not hiding same sex partners, becoming closer to accepting family, or respecting us less. For guys

One day a few months ago I got into the elevator and had the most shocking reaction to this girl. I hardly remember what happened I was so caught off guard—I think I might have asked her which floor she lived on and pressed the wrong button for her. When she didn’t get off I looked up and just the way she smiled at me I literally melted! I’m a 5’ tall dark glasses brunette, not just out of some misunderstanding in an elevator

Fast forward to a few days ago. I was sitting in this common area doing homework with some friends and just as I looked up I saw the back of her head entering one of the apartments. All of these emotions sprang up of wanting to talk to her, but I still feel confused about this side of my sexuality. I definitely find girls attractive in the way that I can point out qualities that I prefer, but when I think of them in the same sexual way that I find my boyfriend I kind of just freeze. I use to feel jealous of good looking girls, but now I just get these crushes! I think about kissing and touching, but anything beyond that I find too hard to face. Is this just a phase?? I keep having nightmares where my teeth fall out and I’m surrounded by angry girls! I have trouble falling asleep at night just wanting to explain to myself what it means to feel this way, wanting to decide my preferences, especially because I want to talk to my boyfriend about this.

A while back, date, hook up, and chat. Grindr is discreet, and allows you to be as anonymous as you want. 3 months ago, I automatically went into ""bro mode"" whenever I hung out with a guy, almost as a defense mechanism (most of my male friends aren't comfortable with me being bi). As you can assume

My advice is simple: use Grindr (or if you're a bi gal, or even have multiple conversations with them. For me it has been a confidence tool. I just chat. Talking to a large variety of gay and bi guys has made me a lot more comfortable with flirting/hitting on men. The fact that it's broadcasted as a hook-up app means every guy who starts a conversation with you is interested in you, and every guy you talk to is at least interested in men. In addition to all that; ever guy you talk to with the app is (somewhat) close to you, so you can go out and date men in your area.

I wanted to give a brief backround of myself and outline my issue. If you are willing to read my post and would like to reply ... it would mean a lot to me. I want to be honest with myself and I havent been able to do that

I'm not a teenager having a sexuality crisis, as a human, can not simply shut off my feelings when I am attracted physically or emotionally to a male. I just lie to myself and tell myself I am not so that I can keep living a lie. 

I have a great family and great close friends. I believe that these close friends would accept me and understand. I also believe some might even already have had a feeling that I might not be entirely 'straight'

As I have grown older its becoming harder for me to be myself and not let my true inner self be released. 

Plain and simple ... I can and am attracted to both sexes. Not entirely in a sexual way
What I mean by this, media and even the internet have given me a false sense of how I should feel. I have never asked for help or reached out. 

I also had this negative mindset

 I want to be open and explore both these possibilities freely and I want to be accepted by those close to me. I know I could be happier in my life by doing so.

1365078224.0,1bnn0i,I had my first experience with another male tonight (2 actually),throwawayfellows,50,6,13,"Long post and lots of details ahead. Sorry.

I've been curious about guys for about a year but only recently considered trying it. I was at home alone pretty bored tonight and feeling kind of horny. I decided to hit up a gay friend of mine and asked if he wanted to get drunk tonight if he wasn't doing anything. He lives with his boyfriend and said they were both staying in for the night and welcomed me over. I got a half gallon of gin and went out

My plan was simple enough. I was going to get wasted and super comfortable and ask them what the gay scene in the area was like. Hopefully they could eventually introduce me to another guy to try stuff with. Even if it didn't work out it was cool because these dudes were solid friends who I hadn't talked to in a while so I was down to catch up if nothing else.

Anyway

 Eventually my friends bf went to bed and we stayed up playing Xbox and drinking a bit. He brought my question from earlier back up and eventually got me to admit I was interested in trying something different. Pretty shortly after he said he was going to sleep but offered me to come lay with him and his boyfriend

We go to his room and he explains the whole thing to his boyfriend

So we lay together and my friend and I cuddled a bit. Eventually he began putting his hand lower and lower on my stomach and I surprisingly got extremely aroused. There was some hesitation

Eventually he has his hand right on my pubic hair area and asks me if it's okay to move lower. I said only if his boyfriend doesn't mind (he was asleep by now). So he decides to wake him up and ask him right there. His bf said it was fine just this once as long as he could watch. 

Things got pretty uncomfortable at this point. I forced myself to say okay since I figured I was already pretty far into things

We lay back down and toss the blanket off the bed

I was pretty hard and after about a minute or two he moved his head down and put my dick in his mouth. I have to admit

I'm not sure how long this went on. My perception of time was pretty far gone really by this point. He asked me if I wanted to go farther. Again

He tells me to roll over on my stomach and gets a bottle of some sort of lubricant out of his dresser. He told me to just lay still and he'd do everything. He put what felt like ALOT of lube on my ass and pushed some in with two of his fingers. After a while he put 3 in and after doing that for a bit asked if I was ready to move to to real thing

He put the tip of his penis in and it hurt pretty bad. I thought I was loosened up enough but maybe I just wasn't. But after a few minutes or so with some coaching he was all the way in (he was roughly 6 inches

He starts playing with himself and my friend starts doing a small thrusting action while I just sort of sit motionless. Eventually he's thrusting more and more, and I caught myself hoping it wouldn't end and he'd keeping pushing more and more in each time, but he maxed out on a short amount of time.

After a while he's going pretty hard it feels like and his balls are tapping into mine each thrust. Each time they touched it felt more exhilarating than the filling feeling in my ass almost. I started to let out a slight moan. Something I haven't ever done with a girl during sex unintentionally.

I feel like my whole body is numb aside from my ass. I didn't feel like I was close to orgasm, and went for it. Didn't really suck on it at first, more just licked and kissed it. My friend from behind sped up and it got me more caught up in the moment, and I kind of instinctively just put the whole (well most of it) thing in my mouth.

As I'm typing this it doesn't even sound real to me. I guess the details are still sitting in. Long story short I kneeled there for what felt like forever and instantly at the same time. It's very hard to explain. My friend said he was about to cum and asked if I wanted him to pull out or just let it go and I told him to just go. He pushed in and I felt a warm sensation pretty deep in my ass. I don't think he came much because it only lasted a short while but it felt oddly amazing. He pulled out and I went ahead and finished his boyfriend off. I let him cum in my mouth but I only swallowed a small bit

I rolled over and my friend jerked me off afterwards and I came almost instantly

We got up and took some more shots and laid back down. My friend said I could always come back for more but I don't know if I will. I'm kinda weirded out by being in the middle of a committed couple like that

Fast forward to a few months ago, I didn't have high hopes.  There also weren't tons of people in my somewhat conservative area looking for another male to join them.  About a week ago, I get a message from a couple who has an interesting profile and some sexy pictures - they're older (I'm in my low 30's, they're in their upper 40's), but mention that they're discreet, picky, and looking to have a good time.
I chat with the wife on and off during the week, and as soon as we walk in the door she's lifting her skirt and showing me her panties, and she goes right for my couch and lays down and pulls up her skirt.  I ask her husband if he's as ready to see what's under her dress as I am, and we both start taking off her clothes.  After a little bit of kissing and stripping on the couch, we head up to my bedroom.  We end up fucking for about 2 hours, in all combinations.  The only unfortunate part was that her husband couldn't get or stay hard.  She had warned me about this during our IM chats the week previous (this is why they had started looking for other people to join them in the bedroom, he's had erection problems lately and she is, insatiable...)

Here's a couple of cool things we've got planned for /r/bisexual:

* An in-depth wiki

This wiki will be *the* source for all things bisexual, which will include topics such as sexual fluidity, and feature FAQs like ""How do I come out?"" and ""My boyfriend just came out as bisexual, what does this mean?""

The reason behind the wiki rather than a new, should have the information posted; this way, everyone has a chance to add, expand upon, and control information.

It will still be modded (i.e. abuse will not be tolerated)

* Events

How do you guys feel about periodic events here on /r/bisexual? Do you have any ideas? Other subreddits do things like: webcam chats, we're here to be a safe place), but I'm sure I'm not alone when I say we need some community-building! I'd love to get to know more of you, and I think we can do so through these events.

On this particular day

About a week later after a lot of thinking of the whole ""How big i was"" ordeal, after a couple of text messages, I told him that i might be curious also. He told me to swing by in an hour so that we could have the house to ourselves. 

An hour passed

NOW FOR THE GOOD PART...On our way back I was shaking, ""why? Are you going to throw up?"". I once again demanded him to pull over. We were in his neighborhood at this moment. He picked the perfect spot, this street had no lights. It was completely dark. He pulled over and said, ""what is it"". I then took my hands and caressed his thighs, grabbed his crotch. Gently running my fingers up and down his crotch area; like a slight scratch. I was getting hard also. Rock hard. I unzipped his pants. Took out his dick and started stroking it a bit. I was literally salivating by just looking at his dick. I went down and started sucking on his dick. It felt amazing in my mouth, I could feel it throbbing. It was nice and hard. I started playing with it with my tongue. When i said i was salivating, I wasnt kidding. I left his dick full of saliva

After about 20 min of me blowing him. I got up and said, he took it all in. He put the whole thing in his mouth and almost gagged. He raised his head and said ""wow, that is big"". After 30 min in heaven. I came in his mouth and that was it.

I think there are some more ""mainstream"" ones that are quite good. I was a sucker for *Brokeback Mountain*. Them onions. I thought *Milk* was pretty good too

Of the more obscure variety, about Allens Ginsberg, his poem *Howl* and the trial regarding it due to containing ""obscenities"". The film basically features three distinct narratives that it shuffles between: you have a biographical-interview type setup with Allen Ginsberg (played by James Franco - yum!) where he goes over various points in his life; a narration of parts of the poem with animation to supplement it; and then you have the court drama on whether or not the book should be banned.

James Franco, and though it might seem out of place at first, you'll learn to love it. Jon Hamm, of Mad Men fame, also stars - playing the lawyer representing Ginsbergs publisher and is thus defending the book in court.

It's a very unique little film, if you're up for something different, or happen to like either Allen Ginsberg or James Franco, then I definitely recommend a watch!

What about you guys - do you have any favourites or other good films that we all simply must watch? :)

1334611202.0,sd197,Coming out as a bi dad,,43,3,19,"cross posted from askreddit

Ok, but frankly I've been celebate since my wife and I got divorced. We got divorced in 2004, but are still good friends and I still would like to do naughty things to her if the situation arose, but the important bit is we still talk and are still very good friends. This is important as my daughter is 12 and lives with me full time, and we both agreed a long time ago that arguing over who did what in the marriage is pointless and just makes it hard on my daughter.

Some more background, but was kind of afraid to say I loved it. This was in a pretty redneck small town (not in the south though, just...lumberjacks). I haven't been with a guy since then, but I the idea of being with a guy again totally gets me going and makes me happy in the naughty places.

It's been 8 years now since I got divorced, as I really thought I was finally gonna have someone for life when I got married.

With all that said, as I know middle school is rough enough without that kind of added complexity.

So, but I think more than anyone I know she will be understanding.  I'm much more afraid of the rest of my family, as my dad's side is very christian, and my mom in recent years has gone hardcore fundie since moving to tennesee. 

Got any advice for me reddit?

tl;dr I'm 32, advice on this topic?


**UPDATE:**
So I came home tonight and was steeling myself to talk to the ex, and she pulled me aside first to say she wanted to talk to me.  She came out to me as a lesbian and explained that that's a big part of why she left as she wasn't being true to herself.  So that made it a WHOLE lot easier to come out to her as bi.  All in all, a very weird but good night.  Turns out we probably could've saved the marriage if we'd both done this years ago, but sadly that can never be.  We both need to figure out how talk to the kid about this, but she's a little more prepared to talk first as she's getting ready to move out of state with her GF, so I think that'll help alot when I have to talk to my daughter.  Hopefully should make the conversation a little easier for us.

So yeah, and actually being able to tell someone about who I really am has been amazing.


**UPDATE 2**

So it's 12:30 at night, would we be in the place where we are now?  How much did my secrecy hurt our marriage?  And then I started thinking about how Forever Alone I've gotten since we've been divorced.  I was never very good at dating, and have been single since we got divorced and that's been 8 years.  She's gotten married and divorced again (though she was pressured into it) and now has a girlfriend she's going to be moving in with, I'm still sitting here paralyzed with fear about the future.  I'm honestly terrified that this is just how things are gonna be.
 I know I'm just over thinking and I should just sleep

**UPDATE 3**

So I had another long talk with the ex, so I think that talk will go pretty well, just have to get myself up to doing it.  I'm also feeling as though I can trust a few more friends with this, and I think within the next few months I'll be ready to tell family.  I'm already an atheist and most of them are pretty staunch Christian, so I figure what's one more way for them to not like me?   ",,False,t5_2qwnx,True

Okay, the most commonly recognizable one being bisexuality. It doesn't matter who you date, who you have sex with, or who you make out with, bisexuality is the feeling of being attracted to both genders. I like to describe it as just liking nice things. This is how I identify myself. I have no problem with someone just not understanding this orientation. I know sometimes it's hard to understand things you don't experience.

She did ask about resources for parents

For those who don't want to read the original post

So over the days, he asked if I was really bi or just curious? I told him I was definitely bi because there are definitely some attractive males out there. He is afraid of the fact that he has female competition and because that I have only been with females in the past, he is afraid I would leave him for a girl. It's honestly an understandable fear but rest assured, I told him I was faithful.

As the days progressed, he jsut sort of said that I was)

Yesterday though was probably the best day. We opened up to each other as if we had been talking to each other for a long time. We both learned somethings about each other and needless to say, the question of where we lived and where we worked got brought up.

Not in a million years did I expect what was happening. It turns out we live literally less than a quarter of a mile apart (if even that). I was REALLY not expecting this part as well. Both of our work places are also 2 minutes apart WALKING. We both laughed and thought this was insanely awesome. So this will make for an easier meetup.

We are meeting up today when I get out of work. I'm going to walk over to his work place while he is working (he told me that would be the best time anyways) because he wanted to properly teach me how to use one of those vaporizers/e-cig things. We both agreed this will be an easy way to strike up a conversation and talk while avoiding awkwardness as much as possible.

**Edit - addition**

I thank each and every one of you for your posts and replies.  No she never asked.  I knew the whole time she was bisexual and I saw her struggling with it.  To answer a few of your questions, we had real marriage vows, so when I say I let her, I pretty much said, ""I release you from that vow or commitment.""  I cannot honestly say that I understand the mind of a bisexual woman, and it's hard enough understanding a woman, but I did she the problems she had.  I saw her try to make friends and it always fell apart, but yes, oddly enough.

Seriously though

EDIT: Post hookup
Ok so, he showed me photos of his hometown . We threw on The Dark Knight. The movie was on mabey 5 minutes and he just went for it. Started kissing the back of my neck. I thought my heart was going to explode it was beating that fast. We were there for mabey another 10 minutes and then went in to the bed room. He went down on me and started licking my ass. I made noises I didnt even think were capable to come out of a human being. It was...exquisit haha! Then he, well...you know....fucked me like his life depended on it. Then he stood up and said ""ok, your turn"" Then I fucked him. It was so agressive. Every muscle in my body was aching, it was so intense. I think it was a bit sore for him for reasons I will leave out for fear of sounding big headed (but I suppose even saying that is implicit enough). So he gave me the almightest of blow jobs when he was goin at my G-spot....I blew all over the place. Even the curtains go it haha! Then I went in for a shower and he followed and started washing me and massaging my shoulders and shit. Things got a bit heated again so we got out of the shower and went at it again, against the wall. Then went back in to his room, chilled out for a while. Then, things got heated again and we fucked one final time. When I was leaving

It went off almost perfect. I had talked with my GF and we decided that I'd invite him along with us for drinks on Thursday, I had a hardon the whole time almost lol but took several cig breaks to let them know each other better. At the end of one cig break I was coming back and they were making out mission achieved lol it was all I could do but to burst out of my pants there. She had this coy teasing look on her face that I won't forget and he just played it cool but had his arm around her and just chatting with me as if that was totally normal. What I like a lot about this guy is that he's naturally masculine and dominant and kind of a jerk but is relaxed and cool about it.

At the end of a couple of hours my gf gave me the go-ahead basically so I asked him if he'd like to come have another drink with us at my place. It wasn't far from the bar so we walked back

I'll write more details later but basically I watched him put on an incredible athletic performance fucking my girlfriend for half the night, the headboard of the bed banging the wall loud again and again. Or him raising her up against the wall and giving it to her hard like that. She sucked both of us off in the beginning but then he sort of took over and fucked her face and I took a backseat after that. I licked her breasts and made out with her as she got her brains fucked out. I came myself more than once, the first time without touching myself just at the excitement of watching this muscular stud fuck her like that.

Nothng bi happened but he is cocky and teases like hell

He left in the middle of the night, and for sure I've never seen her that excited. The show he put on was amazing.
