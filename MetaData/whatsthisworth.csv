First off let me take a second to thank everyone who is making this subreddit a success. To those who research, we hope you are enjoying participating as much as we enjoy having you. Everyone give yourselves a pat on the back... I'll wait.

Patting done? Alright, Historians, Handwriting or Signature Experts, Sports Memorabilia Fanatics, Anthropologists, and of course, pawn shop owners.

In return for your sustained contribution and wealth of information, your very own user flair stating your given expertise. With that, your comments carry a certain clout that tells other users that your opinion on price/value is just as good (if not better) than a link to ebay or other similar sites. This will come in particularly handy when there isn't a direct source for price available. It also states that your comments carry their own weight, and should not require a source unless directly challenged, or otherwise necessary.

So, take a glance at my user name.

 American living in Japan here. My son was helping a friend clean out a house. The owners did what in Japan is called ""Night Fleeing"" which is disappearing in the night often fleeing from debt or family problems. The house was being cleaned out by the owner of the land. 

 They came across this wakizashi (a short sword longer than 30cm and shorter than 60cm) that looks like it has been used before. The blade shows signs of use and is very sharp. There has been damage to the hilt which looks to have been poorly glued back together. The hilt looks to be leather gilded with ???.

 I don't want to take off the hilt to see if the blade has any stamps because the pin looks to be hand made. There are no stamps visible on blade or hilt.

 Because everyone was scared of keeping it my son brought it home. The sword is made of iron so we may have to turn it into the police for ""torokucho"" police authorization.

 What's it worth??

**UPDATE 1:** So I contacted a guy who works with antiques and he explained that having a sword without papers in Japan is very serious. I have to take it to the police right away. 

 The police will issue a temp permit and set up an appointment to get the real permit. That guy will take the sword apart and decide if it is historical enough not to destroy. If deemed worthy I get a permit for about $60.00. If not

 The antiques guy says he will buy even the pieces so I am hopeful. Will keep everyone updated.

**UPDATE 2:** Sorry this took so long

  We don't know if he took it to the police or not. Speculation between my wife and I think that he was covering his own butt for allowing a minor to take home an illeagal weapon.

## Toys / Games / Video Games:

Is it still in the original packaging and in good condition? Check eBay

Otherwise

## Collectible Cards, etc.:

Do you have something that's particularly old, check an online price guide, but don't expect more than $10-$30: http://prices.sportslizard.com http://www.beckett.com

Otherwise

## Coins:

If you have an exceptionally old coin

If you coin is made out of a pure metal (gold

Otherwise

## Autographs / Signed object:

To start, or similar). You might be able to check eBay but there may not be enough signatures to say one way or another. Perhaps a couple hundred dollars, depending upon the person.

If that famous person isn't dead yet

Now, a sports star, a sci-fi actor, a pro video game player, video game developers, etc.). It would require a lot of legwork to determine if this is actually worth something - and, really, $30-$50

## Everything else:

Search eBay for **completed** auctions of your object. This will allow you to see exactly what people are willing to pay for something. If nothing comes up then you most likely have something interesting on your hands and you should post it to /r/whatsthisworth!

Remember: Just because someone is selling an object for a price doesn't mean it's actually worth that price. Auctions are the best way to determine the true value of an object.",,t5_2sslp,True,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/whatsthisworth/comments/kc3w0/whats_this_worth_quick_guide/

I've been on reddit for a bit more than a year and had never tought of asking you...

EDIT : Forgot to write that I had been told once that the handle is empty at first, but was too scared to something wrong.

Now a little back story - I was born in Ukraine and now live in London and study in Norwich. I go back every summer and each time my grandparents find something new; be it medals, shells. My house was used by first the Germans and then the Russians during WW2 and possibly WW1 because we have a huge underground cellar and what was then the most opulent house in the area next to a river. My granddad still tells stories of when he was given chocolate bars by the German soldiers and when the Russians killed them and stayed, how he got his hands on one of their rifles while they were all sleeping and scared the crap out of everyone and broke a floorboard by firing it by accident. So in short, tons of history - I stumble across something new every year. 

This year I decided to research a chaff cutter that
My grandparents were going to scrap it

If anyone could provide more information I would be grateful. The markings on it are:

http://imgur.com/p7wAr

I've been able to discern (with the help of Google translate) that this is a bond for $5 Polish dollars, but I don't have a clue what they would have used.

This was in a box filled with all kinds of documents, including this bond, a life insurance policy that nobody knew about, and shares in a bank which still exists.

If this bond isn't worth anything (or much at all) we'll just keep it for sentimental reasons. But if it has any significant value it would be nice for my grandmother to get some of her father's money. I think she'd like that - a belated gift from him. It wouldn't surprise me if this wouldn't be honored today given the time passed

1376007301.0,1jzrvs,Pearl necklace acquired in a trade...,Skalmatic,21,9,12,"So I had an old Chinese scooter I wanted to get rid of (worth of about $400 since it had a workable engine in it). Put it on Craigslist. Got a couple of trade offers and one or two cash

Sure, pulls out a mini photo album and a jewelry folding case thingy. Tells me a wonderful story of how he and his wife (who was also there at the deal) went to the Philippines last year. Shows me his plane ticket stubs. Shows me pictures of him and his wife travelling in various parts of the Philippines. There's a few pictures of him and the wife standing next to an old Filipino man and two younger men in front of a shack. In front of the shack are also barrels and barrels of clams.

Man says that he bought some of the pearls that this old man found and had strung into necklaces and brought them back. I do some authenticity tests in the parking lot we were meeting at and they felt real. I felt that this was a very elaborate scam that he was pulling if he was pulling one, got a necklace, handed over the scoot.

Took them home and did some more tests on them, all that. I don't want to break one open.

My problem is that there are essentially two options: First, that I got a too-good-to-be-true deal and they're really South Sea saltwater pearls and are very valuable. If I take it to a jeweler and have it properly appraised, and they're Chinese, the value of the pearls just covered the cost of the appraisal and I lose.

TL;DR, not sure if they're good real pearls or bad real pearls.

1315217574.0,k57yx,Gauguin Artwork and French Music Box,castigatio,14,1,9,"Gauguin Menus:

My parents bought three pieces of artwork from what they say was a reputable New York art dealer around 28 years ago. The pieces purport to be menus drawn by Paul Gauguin in exchange for free meals during his time living in Tahiti. The link below shows two of the pieces - the third is at my dad's house (they got split up during a divorce - though obviously should rather be all together)

http://goober99.imgur.com/gauguin_menus

The paper on which the images are presented is raggedly cut and looks like something that I would expect to be original. That said


French Music Box:

My parents bought this piece at an antiques fair in Paris some 40 years ago. It plays a number of different ""songs"" depending on the positioning of various mechanical levers. The box was professionally restored a few years ago - which consisted mainly of replacing various ""teeth"" on the cylinder that had rusted or broken off. The box now plays really nicely. 

http://goober99.imgur.com/french_music_box

The restorer said that the box was quite valuable - mentioning a figure in the region of $12

I'd love to know more about it if anybody is an expert. These pieces have been in my family since I was very young and have sentimental value. 

Thank you!

EDIT: I have gotten closer to identifying the Gauguin Menus - they are titled:

ONZE MENUS: MANOU NEHENEHE (PRETTY BIRD)
ONZE MENUS: RUPE FARANI RUPE TAHITI (BEAUTIFUL FRANCE
ONZE MENUS: LE COMMISSAIRE DE POLICE

http://browse.sothebys.com/?cat=1&amp;event_id=21902&amp;g=1&amp;hp=&amp;hpc=&amp;i=1&amp;is_past=1&amp;page=2&amp;q=&amp;sale_id=N07721&amp;slabrowsesort=lot_sort_number

http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Drawings_by_Paul_Gauguin

In the Southeby's auction one is valued at around $55,000

My guess would be that these are originals of which the ones my parents own are prints - though who knows. I've contacted Southebys and Gauguin appraisers to try and get a better idea. I'm really curious now!

Edit 2: I have found a wikipedia page the seems to describe some context to the menus

http://ca.wikipedia.org/wiki/Onze_men%C3%BAs

I think I have it now

""The collection of menus was first exhibited in 1949 at the Orangerie Museum in Paris to mark the centenary of Gauguin exhibition. In 1950 there was a limited edition and numbered lithographs with a presentation by Robert King [5]""

So the Southebys auction pieces are likely originals and my parents bought some of the limited edition lithographs. Damn I love the internet.

**Some facts that I know about the TV:**

* From the brand: Loewe Opta (Today it's just ""Loewe"") - I also believe that it wasn't put on the market outside of Germany

* Model: Type 33140.

* A PDF of the original manuals is dated (1962/1963)

* It's a console type one as you can see in the picture and therefore is connected with built-in speakers and a wooden case that protected the device for around 40 years.

* Hasn't been plugged in since 1976 until yesterday.

* The Speakers make that sound you get when turning up your volume   really high

* The screen seems to work either but needs to be adjusted (only shows the black &amp; white flimmering).

* The case made out of wood is in a good condition and has fully functioning gates.

* The power plug is the same one as the ones used today (230 V in Germany).

* The retail price was 1488 DM (1DM = ~0.5€ = 0, new cars sold for around 5000 DM) - Do such things raise the value of my object, since nearly nobody was able to afford one back then?

I'm not sure of the year it was manufactured

It is used to identify the temperature of an object, etc. The temperature range is 1400-2200 (top) and 1800-3400 (bottom). in celsius, I believe.

You basically look down the tiny little hole on the eyepiece

This particular one was used in a company in St. Louis Missouri, St. Louis, Missouri, followed by a phone number.

I attempted to contact the manufacturer of this device

The case it is in has it's original leather straps

All the knobs and levers are in-tact, although no charger was included with the device.

It also has these 2 metal rods in the case

This object is pretty obscure to my knowledge

The only way I can narrow this one down is by going to the Pyro website

1315394429.0,k7h94,WTW: Turkish chess set - Pewter pieces and handmade wooden (walnut?) board with mother of pearl inlays.,MonsterInMyBrain,13,2,6,"Hi WTW. I bought a chess set and board from Turkey that I'm looking to sell but don't have a clue as to the value.

I bought it in Turkey while on holiday in 2003. I don't remember much of the transaction and there are no markings on either the board or the pieces. 

The pieces are gold and silver in colour. The metal of the silver ones (not pictured) is probably pewter, but I'm guessing.
The only luck I've had finding it online is a cached image on google images from a now defunct site.

The board is handmade from wood with mother of pearl inlays. I found a [close resemblance on ebay](http://www.ebay.com/itm/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&amp;item=380181769805) so I'm thinking its probably walnut too. I wouldn't have a clue if that's a good guide price from that listing though.

[Here's an album](http://imgur.com/a/UE7T9): I was having lighting trouble so I played with the contrast to take away some of the shine from the pieces. The originals are left in there as well.

It's not as interesting as some of the stuff coming in here but any help will greatly appreciated.

This is part 4 of a 4 part series.  I've had SO MUCH FUN the last few weeks putting my experience and skills to the test

Everyone knows that ivory comes from elephants.  Yes, trade in Elephant ivory is highly regulated.  Pre-ban ivory is allowed to be sold, but only under certain restrictions.  It is very difficult to prove the age of elephant ivory unless a strict chain of custody is maintained.  Due to its rarity, finding prices for the genuine article is not easy.  Here is a snuff bottle with the original spoon still intact.

I bought a Barcelona Chair off a vintage dealer in Boston called [Abodeon](http://www.abodeon.com/) about two years ago and I wanted to just figure out its authenticity before I sent it to repair for some recent damage. It's a from very reputable store

I saw the chair for 900 dollars and pretty much fell in love with it. The lowered price was because it had some repaired damage to it, and said that you could tell it wasn't a cheap imitation because of how heavy it was. And it is heavy, it's a struggle to lift it up between my friend and I, and near impossible for a single person to pick up (of average stature). So, reddit, what do you all think? Pictures below.

Now in most books ive worked with here, but I do see a *very* small mark right where the pages are bound that could be a 15.

James Cummins booksellers is the only site I could find with this item, what is.  Condition is excellent.

**Velvet Painting One:** http://i.imgur.com/yAIzWh.jpg

**Velvet Painting Two:** http://i.imgur.com/PWroL.jpg

**Velvet Painting Three:** http://i.imgur.com/LWbDB.jpg

I received these black velvet paintings several years ago all wrapped in old construction paper from an elderly former Marine (83 years old) who once used to be married to a woman who grew up in Tahiti (either she was Tahitian or was the daughter of missionaries); he spent a few decades in Tokyo after the Korean War before relocating back to the US. I do know he was down in Tahiti when he was married to his former wife - sometime in the late 50's

The paintings have been down in my trunk room - and until now

Also

The photos I took with my mobile phone - I laid the paintings over a glass coffee table - aren't the best quality. Of the three paintings

Does anyone have any ideas on how I might best establish their value?
