First, so just about the only joy I get out of it is seeing people say ""I like it!"" -- I HATE seeing people unhappy with it.

Thing is, and 2 fuzzy critters who don't get nearly enough of it.  RES is something I have to find/make time for, so I simply can't turn around solutions as fast as a software development company does when they release an app with a problem.

That being said - the discouraging part of this all is that it seems to not be RES's fault.  I wish it *was*!  I wish I could tell you ""oops

Unfortunately

**One thing I do want to apologize for:** It seems my decision to move off of Greasemonkey, and the Greasemonkey team had to work so hard to play catchup that it often caused problems for RES users.  That, combined with the ability for native extensions to auto update, made me think it made sense to move to a native Firefox addon.

I still want to keep things in that path.  I think it's the better way to go for the long term future.  Assuming the problem is not RES's fault

I want to spend some time working with the Jetpack team to figure this out before suggesting everyone migrate back to Greasemonkey.  I just wanted to let you all know that I am actively pursuing the issue and that it's not being ignored.

**TL;DR:** I am working on it. I see people are having performance issues and it's not being ignored.

I talked to the Reddit admins today to confirm my hunches about why some of you are having issues with Never Ending Reddit (and

First and foremost: If you do not believe my explanation below

1) You can subscribe to as many subreddits as you want, which are randomly selected.  These selections stay ""static"" for approximately 30 minutes -- then a new random selection is chosen.  **This is key to understanding what's going on**...

2) In addition, you're saying ""give me links #[page size] to #[page size*2] *at this exact moment*""...  This is why you may see duplicate links from page to page!  A link that was #23 a minute ago may be #26 now because of people voting things up and down...

So

There's 2 potential reasons:

1) Let's say you're currently on ""page 6""

2) Alternatively, so anything getting 2-3 up/downvotes has a bit more ""weight"" to it...  When you ask for the ""next"" page, the URL actually contains a parameter that says ""give me the next page of posts after post ABCDE""...  It's possible that post ABCDE and/or the posts around it have moved so much that Reddit barfs here too.

Reason #1 is something I actually confirmed with the Reddit admins tonight...

Reason #2 is a hunch I've developed anecdotally based on my experiences....

RES is free

I've lost my cool with some of these people

However

I have put literally hundreds of hours into developing and supporting RES for free.  I don't owe anyone anything

If you're not seeing what I'm talking about, I pretty much only view the /new of this subreddit - so I see it regardless of vote totals... and yes, I let it bother me when in fact I should probably just ignore it.

Long story short: I'm done beating myself up over getting annoyed with people who start off our ""relationship"" by being assholes about it.  I've done very well in my personal life by being polite and respectful to everyone I encounter until they give me a reason not to.  In my mind

YSK that if you're not paying someone

Basically, then in the ""subreddit"" box, simply place ""/new"" after the subreddit name and it will direct you to the ""new"" section every time you click it! I assume that it simply checks what is in the subreddit box and fills it in after ""/r/"" in the URL, so you could do a decent amount with it, depending on your browsing style. I only use it to go to ""new,"" but someone who browses a subreddit purely for a certain type of thread could put something like ""AskReddit/search?q=cars&amp;sort=new&amp;restrict_sr=on"" if they, for some reason

Upon the release of the latest update for Firefox

I'd like to take a moment to give you an update.  For those who don't give a bleep[s?] about the details

Here's the longer version with some FAQs thrown in...

**Q: Why did RES start doing this in the latest Firefox update?**

Truth is, etc - so for some people and on some OSes (e.g. on my crazy fast work machine with OSX it's much less pronounced / often), the FOUC is either nonexistent or not noticeable.

That it ever worked without a flash of white first was frankly a borderline miracle.

So what changed?  Well, so does the number of things being done and thus the time it takes to execute.

**Q: Great

Well, working with a member of the Addon SDK team to get some questions answered.

The solution for Firefox is actually pretty crazy, but the patch won't make it in until August - so I thought I was dead in the water and unable to fix this for you guys...

Thankfully

Huge

**Q: What about users of Chrome

I know it's been a long time since the last release

Good reasons:

The awesome /u/tico24 has put together a not-so-secret cadre of bug assassins to help beta test RES more formally before new releases.  This takes time, re-re-testing, etc...

I'm under no delusions: the next RES likely won't be bug free... but it should be significantly better.

Bad reasons:

I'm working 9.5-10 and sometimes 12 hour days because the economy has made things a struggle for the (very small) company I work for and I'm busting my ass to try and do everything in my power to keep us from going under.  I'm also doing work completely outside of my job description -- I'm normally the director of our technology team and I handle a lot of client relationships

So, and often 1 more hour of getting yelled at... well... pushing out the next release of RES isn't exactly a task I feel like tackling the moment I walk in the door.  I'm pretty mentally taxed.

Beyond that

This means that 2 of the 4 browsers are essentially forcing me to stop self-hosting RES

However: this means I have to figure out how to smoothly transition you all from a self-hosted extension to one hosted on its respective gallery during each browser's auto update process -- which is of course handled differently and may or may not play nicely.

The downside of hosting RES on the various galleries (web store

/r/Enhancement is clearly growing by leaps and bounds - which has been both good and... well... difficult.  Because of that

**Challenge:**

Anyone who reads this subreddit with any regularity can see that, bug reports and posts here has grown by leaps and bounds.

Although it frustrates me to read the same repeat questions over and over again - I'm mostly concerned that it is devaluing the idea of being subscribed to this subreddit.  Do you really want to subscribe here if most of what you get is repeat questions from people who can't figure out which browser they're using?

I had posed the idea before of having a RES bugs subreddit

so my question is:  What should I do?  How can I keep this subreddit valuable to use as users?

I certainly would like to spend more time posting cool tips and tricks and highlight things about RES that you may be unaware of

1322501824.0,ms6qh,[Followup] I think I've found the primary cause of the CPU hogging issues.,,132,23,60,"(Stats

FF8.0

RES 4.0.2

Win7 Pro x64

All addons enabled.

The primary cause seems to be how well (or badly) certain modules deal with delayed responses ( ~~or possibly delayed submissions or a combination of both - I haven't figured out an easy way yet to determine which leg(s) of the round trip are the most frequent cause of the delay~~ **the delay is 99%+ due solely to waiting for a response from Reddit - the vast majority (again

The FF lags/CPU jumps and memory increases appear to roughly correspond with the delays while waiting for responses

Live Preview/editing comments seems to be hit by the same problem on its own

I've played with multiple enable/disable addon scenarios

Why it happens primarily with FF (with a smattering of other browsers/OSes reporting the same issue) is still a matter of speculation - the primary reason I can think of is that some of RES' function(s) while awaiting responses is stressing the FF javascript interpreter. The fix may be something as simple as relaxing how frequently some of the functions submit and/or check for responses.

**edit: Just discovered Firebug's Network Monitoring feature - will update if that shows anything significant.**

**edit 2: Firebug's monitor shows where the delay is - updating main post.** 

**edit3 tl;dr: 9 hours later. To be clear

**edit4: Next day, eliminating any possibility of addons and FF customizations being involved. Will now install Firebug and continue from there. I'm going to try to make a tutorial for what I am doing in the hopes that technically-proficient non-programmers may find them useful when trying to help the RES team debug issues they can't reproduce themselves**

**Day 3: With the great assistance of GameFreak4321
1.  RES is disk-intensive even when everything is working well. Tests seem to show upwards of 50% of ALL system file activity can be triggered by FF/RES's relatively minor direct disk activity. That can translate into a lot of system CPU time being consumed by drive activity alone. Make sure your hard drive(s)
2.  ~~The FF Flash plugin is a big culprit in file activity. It may help to disable RES' videoTimes option in betterReddit, but is worth being aware of as a possible contributing factor to CPU overloading.  
3.  It seems that RES' handling of links downloaded in the frontpage causes FF to treat them as if they have been ""visited"" immediately, with more locks attempted than unlocks attempted. It's possible that these buildups of unprocessed functions are due to having to wait for loops to sync locks/unlocks. The waiting for unlocks and subsequent bursts of processing, combined with the regular disk activity, are what seem to be causing the CPU overloads. NER may be aggravating this condition on certain systems, but it seems to happen with or without NER enabled.

It would be cool, I felt like I was getting too much of r/aww, I could lower it to say 50%, so theoretically it should front page half as much as it would normally, and I would get a more appropriate mix of that particular subreddit I wanted.

But there are times when I find myself downvoting someone I've previously upvoted, it does not accurately represent how much of their content I've seen. The feature I'd like to request to fix this could take one of two forms:

1. Within the ""[+1]"" tag include the total number of votes given, for a total net gain of +5 karma (meaning one of those votes was a downvote), or;

2. Beside the username show the total number of upvotes given and the total number of downvotes given, ""NotJarslow (6|1)"" would mean I've voted seven times--six times up and one time down--for a net gain of +5. In this situation I imagine the first number colored orange for upvotes and the second colored blue for downvotes.

I should note that I greatly prefer the first option. While both allow the same information to be seen or calculated, followed by **total upvotes** and **total downvotes**. Since the second option highlights **total upvotes** and **total downvotes** more directly than **net karma** and **total votes**, I'd judge it inferior to the first option. It helps that option one looks more elegant and less cluttered to me.

Well

- In Firefox: moving from localStorage to GM_setValue

- In Chrome: Still using localStorage

- In Safari: Same as Chrome.  Technically I could get around the copying situation that Chrome suffers from because Safari does offer some synchronous message passing.  However

- In Opera: Same as above.  Opera's in the same situation as Chrome is - no synchronous message passing


**What else is coming?**

- betteReddit will have some new features

- new module: comment navigator.  you'll see :)

- Inline Image Viewer: major update that fixes a number of little annoyances.  Also: thumbnail preview on hover.

- Some contributed code from semanticist to allow you to see the exact time/date a post was made when you hover over the tagline

- some other smaller additions

Now

The reason I've killed myself to get persistent settings has to do with the forthcoming RES Pro that I'm working on.  As many of you know (and a few of you have been helping test)

It seems to have cleared itself with the latest FF official TST (Tree Style Tab) 0.14.2012111201 and RES 4.1.5 which were updated around the same time (also FF went to 17.0) a few days ago (on my pc).

I suspect it has something to do with thumbnail state/update !?

I've had this 100% cpu problem for more than 6 months with all released FF versions up to FF 16.0.2. It wipes out a laptop battery.

The problem occurred with the TST and RES* (Reddit Enhancement Suite) addons enabled and consistently when I would do the following : (Note * : Problem occurs with both RES addon or RES greasemonkey script !)

    Open reddit.com in a tab with 100 titles (and make the images visible)
    Open more than 5 of the comment threads in new (hidden) tabs until FF uses &gt;700 MB of RAM (I have 4 GB)
    CPU goes to 100 % forever until I move away from the reddit.com tab to any other tab.

If I go back to the main reddit.com it will most likely go back again to 100% cpu as I scroll down. To stop it I have to go away from this main reddit.com tab.

edit: This seems to apply only with the main reddit.com page. (also with reddit.com/top/)

With A LOT of tedious poking around

This also happens with a new profile with only the addons mentioned here.

I have a Gecko Profiler 5 MB file that I can submit later. Vista 32, SuperFetch off, FF disk cache using RAM.

The following are 9 print-screen images of JIT Inspector :

Especially when there are a lot child comments and the parent comment isn't on screen anymore. Hovering on ""parent"" helps

So here's my suggestion. When scrolling through comments the parent comments of the comment you're at should stay at the top of your screen even though you've already scrolled past them. The stuck parent comments should disappear when you've scrolled past the thread they were parents in. It makes for quick looking back on the parent comments. Obviously this could take up a lot screen space. To fix that it could limit the stuck parent comments count limited to 3 (can be option for user) for example. So you only see the parent of the comment you're at and 2 levels outer of that. That's good for deep threads. To fix the problem with long comments the stuck parent could be shortened to a maximum of 5 lines (can be option for user) for example.

I hope my suggestion was understandable enough (it's quite hard to describe what I have in mind). I know such feature would require a lot of work,False,,t5_2s10b,False,,,t3_z6o20

I'd love to have the ability to completely and utterly hide all signs of karma.  Now, still let hide-by-karma work, and so on.  Just hide all incidences of karma everywhere, though.  My user profile, my little name in the corner, and everyone's comments everywhere.  Perhaps optionally offer the ability to turn off voting as well, but theoretically this feature would allow one to vote while still not seeing the karma.

Yes, the value I see in it is that it would encourage you more to be yourself, and not care so much about whether your comment is likely to get positive or negative karma.  Karma really can lend itself to groupthink ... it's a fundamental human need to have the approval of your peers, and that's what karma preys upon.

Haters gonna hate, so I don't see it as a particularly harmful-to-the-community feature.  It'd just be nice to turn off the reminders of groupthink.  That's not to say one can't be who one is even without this feature ... but it'd be a useful aid.

Anyway

I misunderstood what I was looking at when I ran 32-bit FF through 32-bit Dependency Walker via **64-bit** Process Explorer - doing it that way polluted the view in a way I wasn't expecting

I theorized that those policies force-redirecting any program's attempted usage of msvcr80 version \*.762 to version \*.6195 was a possible reason for this ""failure"" to run in ""64-bit-compatible mode"". After all

Well

Microsoft minor versioning numbers just keeping adding together, whereas I, and apparently everyone else who doesn't intimately deal with Microsoft versioning, tend to think that "".7x"" is newer than "".6x""

My only consolation about this comedy of obvious-in-hindsight errors is that nobody has called me out on the versioning boo-boo

I methodically got myself into it

I'm sorry for what turns out to have been wasted effort on y'all's behalf - the sanity-checking worked in ultimately helping me determine whether I was on the right track (nope)

I've been hitting a lot of investigation avenues and doing a lot of on-the-fly spot education

I'm going to take a break from this for a week or so

It's not RES. It's not FF. The issues are too narrowly confined. The outside conditions that cause this are discoverable by programmers using their own methods and techies using *their* own methods. I'm a techie

But I do apologize most sincerely and thank you for your help. I hope my credibility hasn't been too damaged by this - I'm willing to be the leader from the techie point of view in data gathering and collation so that HB has solid data to work with

I didn't see an issue like this in the first few pages of /r/RESissues

The image peeker button is a toggle.  If you click it once, it also has some strange ""smart scroll"" feature to try to get the whole peeked inline image into the browser's window.  This scrolling feature moves the page up or down, which moves the image peeker button relative to the user's mouse pointer.

If the peeker button is showing an IMGUR gallery

I often click the peek button, maybe it ends up being unexpectedly gross.  Half the time, the toggle button has moved, so I end up hitting the inlined image itself by mistake, or some other link on the page, so rather than hiding the image, it opens it even larger on a new tab.

1323871113.0,ncddd,Lets clear up a seemingly common misconception: RES does not detect or hide reposts.,metabeing,77,25,26,"Based on **[this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/nbjvv/if_only/)** it seems that a shocking number of people believe that RES will filter out reposts.

It doesn't.

The misconception is likely from the text ""RES Ignored Duplicate Image"" (or something like that). This text appears only when there are two identical image URLs on the same page.

Full disclaimer: As the creator of http://karmadecay.com I find this to be a particularly irritating misconception

**tl;dr**: The text ""RES Ignored Duplicate Image"" has no relevance to reposts. RES does not detect reposts at all.

---------

**edit:** To make sure there is not a new miscommunication

&gt; I'm assuming that all this is because you feel that these misconceptions are having a negative impact on your site?

No. I'm sure there is virtually no impact. I just found it irritating to see such ignorance on multiple occasions. My association with my KD only causes me to be more acutely aware of what people are thinking or saying about reposts.

1361710399.0,194prt,[tutorial] How to share RES data on dual-boot machines using Chrome/Chromium,MinisterOfTheDog,58,13,4,"Hi there. I recently installed a Debian-based distro on my computer which also has Windows 7 on it. I'm an avid RES user

A. You are going to use the Windows' RES data on your Linux system. First you have to set your Linux OS so it mounts the W7 OS partition on startup. You need to install RES on both OSs before beginning. The way I do it is

1. Create a folder under /media (for instance
 opening a terminal and typing

    sudo mkdir /media/windows

2. Install blkid

    sudo aptitude install blkid

3. Run blkid and identify the Windows OS partition. You may need to use fdisk -l in order to learn which /dev/?d?n that partition is. If you don't get the right partition at first don't worry

    sudo blkid

4. Your partition will be one of these lines

    /dev/sda2: LABEL=""OS"" UUID=""XXXXXXXXXXX"" TYPE=""ntfs""

5. Great! Now we need to edit the /etc/fstab file by adding these lines

    UUID=XXXXXXXXXXX	/media/windows	ntfs-3g	defaults	0	0

6. You could also use /dev/?d?n (e.g. /dev/sda2) instead of the UUID

7. Let's try this.

    sudo mount -a

8. Navigate to /media/windows and check that it's indeed the correct partition. If not

B. If everything is OK up to this point

9. Graphically navigate to the folder

    /media/windows/Users/&lt;YourWindowsUser&gt;/AppData/Local/Google/Chrome/User Data/Default/Local Storage

10. Identify the following files. These are the files that hold your RES data on W7 and the ones you're going to want to use on your Linux OS :

    chrome-extension_kbmfpngjjgdllneeigpgjifpgocmfgmb_0.localstorage
    chrome-extension_kbmfpngjjgdllneeigpgjifpgocmfgmb_0.localstorage-journal


11. Navigate to

    ~/.config/chromium/Default/Local Storage
which is the same as
    /home/&lt;YourLinuxUser&gt;/.config/chromium/Default/Local Storage

C. In this folder (B.3) you'll find the same files you located in B.1

12. This step now changes depending on which data, so let's do it first that way.

13. On the folder from B.1, one to each original file. Delete the files on the folder from B.3 and cut and paste your new created links there. After completely closing and reopening your browser, all your W7 RES data should be there, and any changes you make will also be visible on W7.

14. The only difference regarding C.2 is that you need to replace the files on B.1 folder with the ones on folder 11. (that is

A **head splinter** is a word or phrase people add to their submissions' titles that forces people to read the title by knee-jerk reaction because it catches their eye.

The evolution of a head splinter goes like this:

1. A submission becomes incredibly popular seemingly for no reason.

2. Someone else posts a different submission with a similar title which also goes viral.

3. People begin to isolate the particular phrase in the submission title that catches the eye and over-use it to whore for karma.

At this point people are not upvoting or clicking submissions based on the content behind the link

For example

**Circle jerking** is where you use someone's affiliation with an idea that is close to their heart to game redditors' emotions to whore for karma.  As has been pointed out many times some people enjoy this sort of thing and [there's a subreddit for it](http://reddit.com/r/circlejerk).

For example:

* Does anyone else think this cat pic is adorable?

* Does anyone else remember Scooby Doo?

* HAE had a relative die from breast cancer?

* Anyone else remember waiting for Realaudio streams to rebuffer?

* Here is a picture of my uncle who died recently from complications related to Alzheimer's - he will be missed

Of course the knee-jerk reaction to this is going to be ""oh god my aunt died from breast cancer \* clicks upvote \* because their relative died from cancer

Of course people are going to update this poor redditor whose uncle died due to complications related to Alzheimer's.  He's had enough of a bad day already.

But the truth is, re-hosting it on imgur and posting a sob story to get upboats.

I'm hoping we can identify and share some filters to use to block this stuff out.

     * Comment Section has been clicked

If it does exist I'm sorry I couldn't find it.

Thank you.
___________________________________________
**EDIT:** my response to honestbleeps suggestion that this feature would be ""bad"" for reddit.

_____________________

Wow

However

I am just one user on this website, When I don't like something I downvote it, and when I DO like something, I upvote it, the rest of the links I click that I want to AUTO-HIDE are usually ones that I am indifferent upon.

The majority of these posts already have thousands of votes, or even /r/all /new (of course not to suggest that the class stays on ""new"" submissions, but whoever is looking at it at the time)

The AUTO-HIDE feature would certainly be Self-Defeating if it were allowed on the **NEW** sections of boards

For users, the AUTO-HIDE feature isn't all too impactful as the Voting function of reddit has already done the major part of its job with the users who spend time in the bottom or NEW sections of boards sifting out the good content.

Further still

With AUTO-HIDE enabled with all three features I suggested turned on, where the ultimate result is that I am exposed to more posts that I can decide whether or not to vote on more easily **RATHER THAN** have a page full of fragmented links where I have to find the ones that I haven't already clicked or simply skip down to a fresh untouched page where I miss all the untouched content mixed with the content that would have been Automatically hidden.

As long as I still vote on the links I have an opinion on I still serve a slight function relative to the entire system

Also, where there would simply be posts with only fewer votes. Then again, I would say when you consider how massive and integrated the system of reddit is, who the fuck knows whats going to happen when you add a single feature.... 

certainly though

I'd say its at least worth a temporary implementation to take note of the effects... who knows

Now

* Limit it to TOP and HOT

* Leave a Delay time for Image Preview clicks before its hidden to allow voting (even though there is a short delay anyway)

(comments section clicks should be irrelevant since you are going to the post anyway and can't vote on it there)

i then create another tab called ""news""

**DISPLAY:** my suggestion of where these will be displayed for the redditer to find them are next to the other reddit-tabs on the frontpage. it will look something similar to this:

* B has 1.300 subscribers. The typical top submission gets 70 points. The top submission of the month has 230.

* I find either subreddit to be equally interesting. What does this mean? There's several definitions you can use. You can say I tend to like top n submissions from A just as much as I like top n from B on any given day or time period. Or you can say that if I take the nth submission from A

Every time I look on my frontpage, until I get to the best submissions of B. If I rated how interesting each submission is in percents, my experience goes:

100%, 23%, 13%, 7%, 5%, 4%, 2%, 1%, 98%

* Normalized points = score / subreddit size

* Normalized points = score / score of the top article for that month or year

First

**The good news is that this seems to be addressable without the *need* for new hardware. You can do it with nothing but the help of free tools and your time.** The bad news is that the fixes require patience, weird tough-to-reproduce hardware/software BSODS and other issues should diminish, giving your OS more stability.

Onward:

* I continue to believe (with much empirical proof when I give my final report) that much of the problem is not due to FF or RES - they only act as amplifiers of previously unsuspected problems outside the browser (with two exceptions). I'm making steady progress in greatly lessening the symptoms (proof in itself that FF/RES aren't the main cause) - some of which should be applicable for those who experience the problem on non-Windows OSes. 

* [""DLL Hell""](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DLL_Hell) is alive and well in the XP/Vista/Win7 age. The measures Microsoft has taken to relieve the problem (using [Side By Side](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Side-by-side_assembly)) also masks the problem.

* Ironically

So what's the problem? Firefox needs the 2005 MS C++ runtimes (MSCRT for short), the MSCRT (a collection of 3 dlls - msvcr80.dll, msvcp80.dll, msvcm80.dll) has multiple *versions* (shared among the three files).

IOW, msvcp80.dll, msvcm80.dll). Only by looking at the file properties &gt; details tab for each of those files could you see that all three of them in folder A would show ""Version: 8.0.50727.762"" and all three in folder B would show ""Version: 8.0.50727.6195""

I'm not going into why this caused DLL Hell or the details of how Side By Side is supposed to address it - suffice it to say that FF is compiled to use the last version released for MSCRT 2005 - version 8.0.50727.762. It even includes them with the setup program with the expectation that it will use them after installation.

However, version 8.0.50727.4053, and yet others may have been compiled to work on version 8.0.50727.42, etc.

To save on distribution size, the user is prompted to download and install the official ""Visual C++ 2005 Redistributable"" package from Microsoft.

Here's where it gets interesting. The official package always includes the last/latest version of the MSCRT available *at the time you downloaded/installed it*. In theory

So the official package sets a system-wide policy (using a ""publisher configuration file"") that *all* applications requiring MSCRT versions from the very first one up to the version the package provides will *only* use the version the package provides. If the package provides version 8.0.50727.6195

The package is then maintained by Windows Update

Sounds good, end up using the latest and greatest bug-free (hah) version without having to update themselves.

Yeah. Except that somehow Windows Update did NOT update the official package from 8.0.50727.6195 to 8.0.50727.762 - currently the most recent version

Instead

So the policy was redirecting even ""unknown"" versions like .762 to use .6195

It gets even more complicated when you are using Windows 64-bit and innocently install the x86 version of the original package when directed to do so by a program (or installer of a program).

So

If you're running 64-bit Windows (whether IA64 or AMD64) and *have* the FF issue

* whether you have the official **32-bit** ""Microsoft Visual C++ 2005 Redistributable"" installed in Programs and Features? The entry will **not** say ""(x64)""

You may or may not have a separate ""Microsoft Visual C++ 2005 Redistributable - (x64)"" entry as well. Both entries will look something like [this](http://i.imgur.com/t4q1z.png).

* If so, if you somehow did install it later on without uninstalling the original package, you will see *two* identically-named entries (along with the x64 entry, if also installed). If you uninstalled the original x86 package before installing the x86 SP1 package, then the SP1 package will *appear* as if it's just the original package, leaving you with the same entries per my screenshot.

Are you confused yet? Welcome to New DLL Hell.

* Next, or if installing SP1 without uninstalling the original package simply ""overwrites"" the single entry - or even if it is a second entry but actually indicates that it is SP1.

I am *not* asking users (of either x86 or x64) to get and install SP1 right now - if you have the FF problem

Dang it

I'll come back and edit this tonight with better step-by-step instructions

The easiest way to find out (for FF and for other running programs) is to download Microsoft's (formerly sysinternal's) Process Explorer utility, then Ctrl-D, (to enable the lower pane view and set it to show dlls associated with a process) leave it running, and run FF.

Once FF is running

You can find the path of each dll by right-click &gt; Properties

The pattern of your reports of whether the official MSCRT runtimes are installed, whether you are running 32 or 64-bit windows and the dlls that end up being used after all that will go a long way to helping me determine how I actually write this up and what other measures need to be taken besides fixing the mess caused by dll hell.

Over-confidence is a bitch. I chose to retract my mistakes and put out this warning despite the embarrassment so others hopefully won't fall into the same trap - or at least make the minimal effort to check event logs with a different POV.**

Gaddommit! Not sure what variant(s)

Check your event logs for errors in manifests

MSE will also show occasional errors like:

Session ""Microsoft Security Client OOBE"" stopped due to the following error: 0xC000000D

Wireshark is showing traffic going to unexpected places - with many of those packets obfuscated.

Monitoring scans by Hijack This/Spybot/MSE/MBAM and others with Process Monitor shows brief directory locks/unlocks interrupting their scans

Basic ComboFix scanning has one of its modules blocked from boot loading due to ""incompatibility"" and another part of it is prevented from user interaction after reboot. It *did* delete some things on first pass (before reboot) - FWIW

c:\programdata\ntuser.dat

c:\users\\*user*\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Cookies\index (2).dat

c:\users\\*user*\Documents\Readiris.DUS

c:\windows\UA000091.DLL

Which suggests that at least one infection was a variant of Win32/Alureon.H - but as I said

I'm thinking my Verizon Actiontec router was the breach

If you're curious about my normal precautions and habits, man (hackers) can undo. Holy wars over which precautions and software in use ""works best"" isn't the point - the point is to doublecheck whether **you've** been equally breached no matter how confident you are that your existing methods work.

Fortunately (from a reinstalling point of view), and even successful cleanups leave systems unstable more often than not.

I didn't start counting upgrades as separate from installations until recently

- Nearly 7
- Nearly 6
- 302 users have installed RES in Opera.
- 85 users have installed RES in Safari.

Looks like all that effort I put into making RES work in Opera and Safari may have been for a pretty small number of people... but hopefully they are enjoying it :-)

Anyway

I've been too busy as of late to work on RES

Next release:

- I'll be focusing on making the inline image viewer a little bit better

- I hope to make more features ""play nice"" with Never Ending Reddit

- There will be a number of bug fixes

- There's a new surprise feature that I think will be pretty divided in terms of audience. Some people will LOVE it. Others will quickly turn it off.


For the future:

Something I'm still thinking about / planning is making some of the modules handle their work in a completely different way.  For example, and large comment pages really cause it headaches (in Firefox, at least... Chrome seems way more efficient!)...

* Are there any specific subreddits that you'd mention that has a very good support for nightmode.

I have not offered an explanation of what I did because I don't want to teach ""RES bad habits"".  My code is below

------
Adds the ability to pause and restart the the never-ending-reddit subfunction of the RES with a mouse click.  

Works on Firefox 5 (what I'm using).

Edit: BUSTED BY THE AUTHOR!  Somebody went and told on me.  I could have got a lot of karma for this but I got caught.  Good thing I'm not a crybaby.

On the other hand

I like the size and location of my pause link and I hope honestbleeps uses that location in the final version.  More than that

For any of you that have never tried to work on someone else's code

**Debugging** edit: I wasted some time just figuring out how to try things

**Debugging edit 2**: Quickly find the RES script on your system. The Greasemonkey installation puts a little monkey face in the toolbar

-----

First, but for casual hacking just edit the script right where it is and keep the same name.

Make changes to the .js file and reload Reddit.  If RES disappears (won't load), it seems to be hard to do permanent damage to yourself.

If you get something to work

That's it.  If you're curious

 edit: sentence structure

earlier post
-----------
Just a few small modifications to the ""RES"".js file did the trick.  I'd like some feedback before sending it to the author for possible inclusion in the RES.

Edit: Here's the [script](http://cobaltcrystal.com/redditstuff/reddit_enhancement_suite.user.js).

Edit2: it looks like you can install it directly from the link if you want.  I haven't tried that.

If you don't know what to do

You can save your existing script if you like but it's faster to just reinstall RES if you want the old version back.

I had what I wrongly *thought* was a pretty simple process

Often times, some panicked users did that without thinking / realizing this would happen.

So here's what you need to know:

1) Unless you went into greasemonkey and uninstalled Reddit Enhancement Suite

2) I'm working on a new script as well as a very quick screencast / tutorial on how to migrate your settings for those of you who are still stuck.  I hope to have it ready sometime tomorrow

3) If you're REALLY anxious, etc...  If you see those things -- your data still exists, and is recoverable!

1. So

2. An extension/add-on market if you will. Which consists of simple scripts that can run via the [Reddit Enhancement Suite](http://redditenhancementsuite.com). The scripts should be  easily accessible through RES author website for easier finding. User submitted scripts that would be too small to implement over all the versions of reddit enhancement suite and maybe browser unique(note sure how that would work).  Maybe work in a voting system like reddit for usefulness.

3. Just a fast way to link rage faces or some reaction gifs/jpegs. I see this being implemented like how the subreddits come up. Instead of doing [/r/](/r/) it would be activated with i/ or // then as you type
 Maybe something like this could be found on the add-on page.

      a). More ideas for a scripts or features


I didn't mean to make this into a wall of text but I just wanted this out there. The first one is the one I would rather see implemented into RES than the others. The other 3, users would seek out add-ons to fit their individual taste. 

Finally, which kind of seems like a huge task to take on.

There's been a bit of talk about abolishing the sum of Karma points to reduce the amount of submission and comment spam. One way to tackle it is at a site-wide level

Quality Karma measures the average quality of a person's submissions.

- If someone has submitted 2
- If someone has submitted 30 links and has a karma of 200 then their Quality Karma would be 7 (200/30 = 6.666...).

For post titles, the icon is placed at the end of the link text.  Besides the basic inconsistency, there is a functional problem with this choice.  If you place your mouse over the icon and click to expand the image, you can't just click again to hide the image.  An annotaion is added in front of the link text which changes the position of the icon.  Thus, to hide the image, you must move the mouse to click the icon.

[Here is an example](http://i.imgur.com/dIIaK.png).  I've placed the before and after images above and below.

The toggle option switches are displayed for me as a metaphorical horizontal sliding switch, Red, Blue) and two words (On, Off) to communicate with the user.

There are many issues with this control that would not be such a problem

Current behavior of the control:

1.  Clicking anywhere on the switch will toggle it's state

2. The Off side displays as Red or Gray.

3. The On side displays as  Blue or Gray.

4. The On and Off text labels remain present regardless of which state is being indicated.

5. There is no intermediate state change progression visual animation to assist the user in learning to interpret the visual cues of the control

Problems with the current behaviors:

Improvements suggested:

Behavior 1.: Do not toggle the switch when any area is clicked

Behaviors 2. and 3.: The tri-color state change does not make sense - when combined with persistent on/off text labels in the switch slide regions it breaks the intuitive metaphor of a sliding switch.  If both on/off text labels remain present and stationary for both state indications

Behavior 5.: The real slide switches that this control is styled after provide a successful visual cue to the user by physically displaying only one of the two text labels at a time.  This is typically the CURRENT state of the physical switch control.  Industrial and electrical design has pretty consistently implemented this, as iOS settings do.  

Color choice:

Using the color red indicates generally (to american/canadian audiences anyway) that something is dangerous, or the option that is not typically chosen.  The red color being on the OFF side of every single preference switch provides this information inappropriately - the OFF side is not the side that everyone always wants to avoid.  I don't think most of the switches even represent preference that have any recommended state.  Thus the three-color approach using red provides the user with subtle superfluous information that slows comprehension of the switch function and relative preference importance.

Conclusion:

Individually most of the behaviors are fine

Changing just one or two of the behaviors will markedly improve the experience and usability of the preferences screens.",,t5_2s10b,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/Enhancement/comments/11r7u9/feature_request_toggle_switch_ui_is_very/

The highlighted line is not part of RES, and start again, so that I know where the next parent comment begins.  That line on the far left totally throws me off though, and I scroll down half the comments section wondering why the top comment has so many child comments.  Is anyone else experiencing this?  Is it possible for RES to provide a workaround, or is this something that should be taken up with r/askreddit?

Maybe I'm the one dummy that's had a problem with this

Thanks!
