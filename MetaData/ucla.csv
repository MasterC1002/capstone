1329885857.0,q0h3i,The definitive best/worst places to take a shit at UCLA,detective_mosely,96,12,63,"Unlike some

I like handling my business in nice, these are the factors that contributed to my rankings. Feel free to contribute your opinions in the comments, I'd love to know your thoughts, or more importantly, if criteria on this list are outdated, as I graduated four years ago. Also, pardon the north campus bias

**Top 5 Best**

**5. Kerckhoff Hall**
Writing for the Daily Bruin meant that I spent quite a bit of time amongst the other writers at Kerckhoff Hall (and mocking the Persians at Kerckhoff Patio). While it doesn't get a glowing review in terms of satisfying my most important criteria, and were where I wrote my thesis for my senior seminar on my laptop.

**4. Young Research Library (YRL)**
My preferred place of study (top floor)

**3. Kaufman Hall**
Arguably the classiest shit you'll take on campus, I'd go here.

**2. Student Activities Center (SAC)**
Some of the most relieving shits were taken here as the SAC maxes out the two important categories of cleanliness and privacy. I preferred the single-stall bathroom in the eastern wing of the building.

**1. Royce Hall**
This is a controversial pick for number one as it's quite unlike my positive criteria – it's not the cleanest *and* it's a busy bathroom, I took some classic post-final shits here. The traditional values may be low, but the historical and sentimental values are high here.


**Top 5 Worst**

**5. YRL**
For as much as I didn't mind shitting at YRL

**4. Melnitz Hall**
You'd think a building dedicated to our renown School of TV, but this bathroom was old, dirty, and busy. The writing on the walls of the stalls can be viewed as a positive or a negative addition, but the shits you'll have here will be dirty and forgettable.

**3. Ackerman Union**
To be fair, 2nd floor of Ackerman is dirty, busy, and the stalls are cramped. Fun Find: Next time you're here, note ""UCLA"" tiled on the floor near the exit.

**2. South campus restrooms**
This might be out of date as I've come to find out that they're finally replacing the buildings in south campus, it loses in ambience – this place is excessively bright, devoid of life, and unremarkable – much like the building's regular inhabitants.

**1. Powell Library**
Powell was where I'd get my late-night studying and babe-watching done if I was with my ""study buddy"" (YRL felt like I Am Legend compared to Powell late at night). There never was a time where I'd go to the bathroom in the basement where it didn't have someone else in it, the soap didn't smell like some sort of pungent institutional powdered soap, or that the hinges or locks on the stalls weren't broken. I don't know who the fuck is responsible, but to his credit – EVERYTHING is wet, flooded, and disgusting – perpetually – in Powell.",,self,default,

I was curious where this was going. ""I love them"", I told him. He smiled, bagged them up, and he said ""do you think you could do me a favor?"". 

He explained that his car was a rental that he had gotten for a full month. There were still two weeks left, asking me how much I could possibly come up with, could I borrow any money from friends, any textbooks I could sell etc. After it became clear he wasn't getting any money out of me, he took back the suits and even his business card.

I got back home after class and checked out what events had been going on at the Staples center. Certainly nothing that an Armani salesman would attend. I think this guy was probably running around with knockoff Armani jackets trying to scam someone out of their 500 bucks.

With Travis Wear out for the second half with a concussion, put on a very strong performance but tried to play hero 5 too many times with his brother's absence. Shabazz Muhammed played like the highly touted recruit was expected to play against big-time opponents. Larry Drew II fed everyone and finished with 9 assists. All in all, it was a well-rounded game against an AZ team who has some pretty nice wins already this year.

UCLA violates FCC codes

Hi

In order to enforce your 'piracy' filtering/snooping. You violate ALL
THREE parts of the FCC Report and Order issued on December 21 2010.
This blocks legitimate traffic. I do not pirate content
understand how it works because I am a network engineer. File sharing
is used for MANY OTHER THINGS than pirating of material. If File
sharing was not allowed
operating system like Unix would never exist without the ability to
transfer LEGAL material over the internet.

The fact that your movie is so blatantly biased towards the movie
industry
Draconian rules on campus for internet usage
violate the FCC report and order that I have attached.

Since I cannot write it better
Communications Commission:

I. PRESERVING THE FREE AND OPEN INTERNET
1. Today the Commission takes an important step to preserve the Internet as an
open platform for innovation, economic
growth
expression. To provide greater clarity and certainty regarding the
continued freedom and
openness of the Internet
in broadly accepted Internet
norms
i. Transparency. Fixed and mobile broadband providers must disclose the network
management practices
conditions of their
broadband services;
ii. No blocking. Fixed broadband providers may not block lawful
content
services
block lawful
websites
services; and
iii. No unreasonable discrimination. Fixed broadband providers may not
unreasonably
discriminate in transmitting lawful network traffic.

Violation of subsection i falls under the fact that UCLA will not
disclose any of their network management practices. Go ahead
and you will get a brick wall.

Violation of subsection ii falls under the blocking of LEGAL DNS
service (port 53). By not allowing access to outside DNS servers
(which is 100% legal I might add)
and potentially blocking lawful websites.

Violation of subsection iii falls again under the blocking of DNS
service (port 53). By forcing the use of UCLA DNS servers
unreasonably discriminating against other DNS service providers (such
as open DNS).

So now that you know the information
Please tell me why taxpayer money is being used to undermine the
efforts of the Federal Communications Commission. As an educational
institute
follow the money trail.

Until the pieces of legislation the Stop Online Piracy Act
Protect Intellectual Property Act are passed
ILLEGAL. I demand that you cease and desist
students apologizing for your blatant disregard to Federal codes
regarding broadband control and usage.

I am a UCLA student
by such a terrible
falsify information easily. By lying
do the latter.

Fast forward just a year and a half and our fledgling village has transformed into a fast-growing city (and will hopefully become a bustling metropolis!). 

The moderators of this community (unchikun, and myself) who work only to make your experience in this city optimal, are working tirelessly behind the scenes to make certain your stay is what you expect from a community which represents one of the top higher education institutions in the world.

I graduated from UCLA in 2012 and have been working on a website to help college students find apartments. Finding an apartment really sucks, and I hope that I can help you find a good one!

The website is called Aptologist. It's designed to remove the clutter you'd see on other websites and to focus on the important things. It's built around reviews so you can finally call out that landlord for extorting you out of your deposit!

It's still in a beta phase, negative, thermonuclear, catfacts, whatever). Please post some reviews while you're there and help out some fellow students!

Anyway!

First off... **/R/UCLA SWAG!!**

Now that I have your attention: There will soon be a ""a meetup themed prize pack"" in the mail heading my direction, again, as for distribution of swag, priority for things will go to people who helped out most during the competition. More on that when we get the stuffs. 

Speaking of meet-ups! I notice a lot of meetup attempts that garner only a few people. Bigger ones can be done

Anywho. There will be some sort of reddit ""college week"" where the front page layout will match the winner's school's subreddit css. We're still working on a redesign and logo (i've been busy :( ). Again, artistic input) feel free to message me and we'll get ya into the loop.

i think that's all I wanted to say. i probably forgot something

Have a good rest of your week! And for the coming quarter

**DON'T FUCK UP.**

Janet has gone through one round of cancer - she was diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia in 2009.  She fought it with grace and determination, Janet needs to find a bone marrow match by this April.

Knowing Janet and hearing stories about all the other people waiting for a bone marrow transplant pushed me to register to be a bone marrow donor.  If I am a match for anyone

Here's where you can help.  **Monday

The best way to help their chances is for every team that they'll be facing from here on to be as highly ranked as possible so that their strength of schedule allows them the possibility of rising back up the rankings.

Introducing... [The /r/ucla Classifieds](http://www.reddit.com/r/UCLAclassifieds/) subreddit!

So, and roommate requests, so I've created a subreddit to consolidate these sorts of posts. I'm hoping by tagging the posts, it'll make searching easier if you're looking for a specific type of request. 

Also, so i'll let those who are still looking just create new, more descriptive posts. After a week, hopefully our sub is going to be less crowded, so we can get some content going as the new school year starts.

Please let me know if you have any suggestions!

If you or anyone has had things stolen or magically disappear from your bag at the track

Tonight at about 11:00pm, walk the stadium up, and out towards the bruinwalk crossing light.

Last year my girlfriend and her roommate had their phones stolen and he got away (this is how I recognized him tonight)

Tonight I was finishing up a run and saw this piece of shit loitering around someone's bag. My mindset is automatically ""This is the guy, and sure enough a wallet is missing. I tell him I've seen the guy before and we go up the stadium looking for him.

I confronted him as he walked out of the stadium with the person whose wallet was stolen. He was very negotiable and non-threatening, etc, but we found nothing indicating he stole anything. He said he wasn't a student but a resident of the area. I stupidly did not get his name. So our confrontation turned inconclusive, but as we walked back toward the stadium, lo and behold, we find victim's wallet on the ground, well away from anywhere he had been running or where his backpack had been. His wallet: empty of the cash that it had contained. 

My guess is that the guy will take things like cash that can't be proven stolen

I am sick of this motherfucker getting away with his crimes, here again are his identifying traits.

* Black male
* About six feet in height
* Early-mid twenties
* Comes at night
* Wears grey sweatpants and grey sweatshirt
* Claims to be a resident of area and not a student
* Eerily agreeable

* It's simple, we can easily double our numbers. Introduce them to reddit (and utterly destroy their social life), and subscribe them. That's it.

* I made some super cool flyers [here](http://i.imgur.com/9pvPF.png) and [here](http://i.imgur.com/zDtDA.png) that you can print out and just post around the buildings and rooms your classes are in

* Chalk is pretty cool. [This](http://www.reddit.com/r/ucla/comments/l2m9l/what_happens_when_your_moderator_is_an_art_major/) was something a friend and I did around campus. You can be less fancy and just write ""reddit.com/r/ucla"" in the corner of the chalk board in your lectures. Feel free to add a little alien or something for a touch of fancy. Ask for permission... i guess.

**2.** WE HAVE [FLAIR!!!!](http://www.reddit.com/r/ucla/comments/ldw58/flair/). This the cool little tag next to my name. Get yer own now! 

**3.** Our [Facebook group](http://www.facebook.com/groups/198370070197972) has 264 members?! So much so that we've lost our ability to do group chat through the Facebooks. Have no fear, our most recent Ent meetup was a great success. Most fun i've had in a while.

**3b.** Which brings me to the next point: yes,"" and it uses real names, please do not post any sort of incriminating information regarding you, other members, or this subreddit. Remember, we're still representing UCLA. If you find a message of yours mysteriously disappeared, it's probably because I deleted it and feel free to use whatever euphemisms and innuendos to reword it. Don't want no troubles

I know you have jokes that a trojan can only be used once, or that USC is really a school of spoiled children (I can tell you that is true). Does it ever go the the extreme? 

tl;dr Is the rivalry as exaggerated in UCLA as it is at USC?

I graduated last June. I've got law school apps out and needed to find a job in the mean time. I was looking specifically to work at a law firm to bolster my apps and for that reason wasn't totally overwhelmed by that 'oh-shit... I-should-have-studied-science' existential moment. In 3 eternal weeks of searching, but livable wage, and I get full benefits. This was accomplished with an unremarkable GPA (~3.5), generic softs, a degree in Philosophy (no double, no minor), a few months previous relevant part-time experience and - most importantly




- **DO YOUR RESEARCH** about the place to which you're applying: know as specifically as possible what they do and who does what.


- **SHOW UP EARLY..** my target is ~20 minutes..  If your interview is at 3:00pm and you show up at 2:50


- No, and express your interest. People love an audience, but be *cool*; don't brownnose. People want more than anything to be able to tolerate, ideally even enjoy the company of the people they're working with. In an interview, you're trying to get your interviewer(s) to 1) remember you, and 2) remember that they like you more than the other applicants. If you manage to break the wall, one candid conversation can go a very long way. Example: one of the managing partners of the firm I currently work for has a sports law blog. I came in with his last few entries fresh in my mind.. the two of us talked about the state of Bruin basketball for a full 15 minutes while the other two people in the room listened in and laughed... At my previous job


- Finding common ground with your interviewer is important, as a general rule of thumb, try to get them to talk more about themselves and their business than you talk about yourself and your ""accomplishments"" (however counter-intuitive that may seem). You're 20-something.. Odds are you haven't done anything terribly remarkable, and that's perfectly understandable; even expected. In any event, they've already got your resume. They know what you're selling.. 


- **DRESS WELL** ... Really, you wouldn't believe the general disparity between well and poorly-dressed people. In an interview, the way you're dressed accounts for one of the strongest, most lasting impressions you can make, and it's probably the only aspect of an interview that's totally under your control -- don't squander potentially free points. Dressing well means spending a little more on a pair of shoes / shirt / slacks / haircut than your normally would. And if you don't think you have good style (or if you know you don't...), find someone who does and get them to go shopping with you. It shouldn't be hard. Whether they'll admit it or not, the fashion-conscious love being asked to do fashion-related things. And just for the record, I know less


- Wait one day after the interview and then **FOLLOW UP**. Email or phone call. Up to you. Express your thanks


- Try not to be devastated by rejection(s). You go / went to UCL-motherfucking-A. We quite literally run this city (huge, be selective if you can afford to be. Don't stop looking for the dime piece just because a ""6"" is willing to jerk you off in the bathroom for a while. Better jobs = better experience = better on your resume = a better next job / grad school app. 



Source: I've had a ton of interviews in my short time for a ton of different things - plenty of paid jobs in plenty of different fields.. schools, internships, volunteer positions, etc. - and I've gotten offers after each of them; this most recent 3/4 being the only exception. The above is arbitrary advice based on what I think I did right and what I noticed I did differently from the often more-impressive-on-paper people I was competing with. I've also always asked (and have been told) what stuck out in my interviews.

I feel like such a failure. I'm currently a second year, i made basically zero friends and got involved in nothing besides going to class/tutoring/attempting to befriend people in my dorm. (My fault, I know). 

This year I did explore more...I joined one pretty big organization I'm passionate about and made a ton of acquaintances and a couple of good friends. I decided I'm sticking with trying for a B.S. even though my classes are still insanely difficult for me. 

But I still just feel really disconnected from UCLA. I don't feel like I've found my niche and I'm starting to think maybe its too late and I just shouldn't have come here. I don't really understand why everything has just gone so...unexpectedly. I promise I'm not totally creepy or whiny or ugly or something in real life but I have no school spirit, I feel like a social failure because of the number of failed sort of friendships/relationships I've had here and I still get kind of homesick pretty often...

I'm betting that the fact that finals are just around the corner and my classes are totally dominating me right now has something to do with this mood....but still. I guess I'm just curious if anyone else feels/has felt like this/if anyone has advice or could tell me where and how they met cool people here? Maybe I'm just a douche magnet/smell bad or something?

As a third-year student in a research laboratory, this post will help anyone feeling a bit in the dark about research here at UCLA.

Of course

Let's begin!

To actually start research, download the pdf, and find a few (read: many!) labs that you find interesting. Send each lab a well-written email containing a bit about yourself, your reasons for joining, and anything else relevant to the lab (animal care experience, etc.). If all goes well, you should be called in for an interview and if that goes well

After completing at least one quarter of SRP 99, 198). This course is two quarters and results with a full scientific paper of your research. 


For those already completing an upper-level research course

Hey all!

Any and all Adventure Time fans at UCLA should know that Cartoon Network is sponsoring a House Party event on February 9. Fans of the show can currently submit an application to hold a House Party,000 chosen, will be sent an exclusive DVD of the new Fionna and Cake episode (""Bad Little Boy"") to watch before it airs. The Party Pack they will send to winners includes AT gifts and assorted merch. I'll let you guys comb over the House Party site for additional details.

We are one of the IFC fraternities (AGO) on Landfair. Now, and combining that with our unique situation (most applicants are just families looking to host a small viewing party with their child's friends) we think we stand a fair shot of getting a host spot.

Any help with drumming up interest in our post would be greatly appreciated, constitutes an invite to all of you should we be chosen to host. AGO has recently hosted an event of ~150 people at our house, so we can accommodate a sizable group (and if needed will get screens other than our living room TV going). It is on a Saturday around Midterms, so if you want to take a break from studying this would be a fun way to hang out with other Bruins who like AT. ",,False,self,False,t3_17352n
