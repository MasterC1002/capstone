The first example he gave was if you ask an adolescent boy about his father you will often get something about how stupid the father is in what a pretty typical adolescent rebelliousness. But when you observe that child around his father, fear and love for his father. So which is the lie, the world in which that boy lives or the world in the boy's head?

Zizek uses many more examples

The idea here is that who we are is rooted in our actions. The story in our head

I can't tell you how many times I've found some excuse not to work out today

The fact is, it isn't a one time thing, or extenuating circumstances - I am now a person that will sleep until noon. 

I am not some person that lives in my head. I am what I do. And every time I fail to act

Have you sat on reddit for a few hours today doing nothing? If yes, period. There is no story or context, just the fact of your actions - that is who you are.

Every since I've realized this I lost the crippling narrative of

Since I have realized this, and z tomorrow to be something. I am x, y, and z. If I want to be rich I don't have to get organized, or become organized - I must be organized. And that isn't something that I just choose to do one day as a chore, it's not some switch that I turn on when I really need it - it's something that I do or don't do through my actions, every day. And if one day I decide to be lazy or procrastinate, I'm a person who is sometimes lazy and procrastinates. So I either act otherwise

Sorry if this too steam of consciousness or doesn't make any sense - but it has helped me a lot over the past week and figured I ought to share. ",self,t5_2rmfx,False,strategy,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/GetMotivated/comments/wlhzu/a_way_i_have_recently_changed_my_thinking_that/

I used to be the one of the laziest kids around in High School. I didn't find High School particularly challenging, but still something I can hold my head high about. I give to you Reddit some tips to be successful and stay motivated.


1. Finding Motivation - It doesn't matter if you know all the correct ways and strategies to study if you do not have motivation. I don't care what your motivation is, people telling me I was never going to be successful. Wherever you find you your motivation never forget and always reminding yourself of it. 


2. Proper Learning Habits - I give you an example of two kids that I know. One kid that I knew in college was always spending ungodly amount of hours studying. Hours upon hours of studying, and they were similar when it came to smarts, is the way they went about learning. One kid sat there and just memorized and memorized and memorized. I would see him just staring at his notes reading over and over. The other kid I knew always had his book out, notes out, and was always writing things down. One kid was memorizing while the kid was learning. You need to be able to teach the material to someone else not just spit out random facts. 



4. Study Strategies -  Now that you know its about learning here are some strategies I have. What worked best for me when learning material was taking it slow and trying to nail down a topic before I moved onto another topic. You need to be active when study. I would rather spend and hour trying hard and studying then wasting five hours of my time memorizing. You need to test yourself write out questions and then answers. Go over your notes and be able to lecture them to somebody or the wall. For technical based classes you just need to practice problems there are thousands of problems you can find online for numerous classes. I want to add sometimes you can get a different perspective on things googling your topic and watching YouTube videos. 


5.  Time Management - You know time management is crucial

Edit*

6. Embrace the Suck - One thing I always hear from people when they are giving out advice is that you have to try and find enjoyment in what you are doing. I am sorry

7. Get a shitty Job - Now this one is more geared towards students rather than people who have graduated and gotten a degree, so I could get a good paying job and do something that I enjoy. It also forced me to schedule my time better. I didn't always have a ton free times between work and school, so I didn't get distracted with other useless tasks. 

8. Self - Improvement - One of the best things here about /r/getmotivated is that sometimes we create a chain reaction when start picking up good habits. There are simple things you can do which will build your self-confidence


tl;dr: Get pissed off and motivated, it's going to suck, get a shitty job, always improve yourself.

Loved to hear your questions guys thanks for the feedback


I'll be back for more if you guys are interested just wanted to help some people out at reddit. Love to answer some questions if have some.

- Problems are always easier to face when you aren't running away.

- Virtually all self-destructive and potentially self-destructive behaviors are triggered by anxiety.

- Anxiety

- Putting something off until I feel like it is the WORST strategy for getting things done. Procrastinating ruins the present and makes the future more difficult.

- Avoiding uncomfortable feelings or thoughts is the most destructive kind of procrastination.

- Motivation is never found or given

- There is always a motive behind my actions. If I am wasting all day online

- I have to choose to want to grow and improve more than to be comfortable. It isn't ever going to happen by itself.

- Every day I push myself

- Every day I run on autopilot

- Not everything goes my way. It never will.

- Life isn't perfect. It never will be.

- Anything

- Fantasizing about what I'd like to happen

- Every day I choose who I am. If I don't make a conscious choice

**Step 2:** Apply the [Pomodoro Technique](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique). This is a tool for time management – you study/work for 25 minutes and then take a short five minute break. This is called a *pomodoro*. After four pomodoros

**Step 3:** Adjust your internal dialogue. Read *The Now Habit* by Neil Fiore if you haven’t. By reading this book you will understand that distress comes from the anxiety of delaying projects (among others). Procrastination is a result of things like pressure and fear – the only way to defeat it is by reducing negative emotions. TheCourageWolf wrote a great post [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/GetMotivated/comments/rxsbz/introduction_to_motivation/) on emotions.

Because your internal dialogue determines how you feel and act

* Replace “I have to” with “I choose to.”

* Replace “I must finish” with “When can I start?”

* Replace “This is so big” with “I can begin by taking one small step.”

* Replace “I must be perfect” with “I can be human” and accept it.

* Replace “I don’t have time” with “I must take time.”

**Step 4:** Reward yourself after you have earned it and rest.

Let's examine the reasons behind this result

When people are given a good label

If you're called smart

If you try your very best, or maybe that you're not smart anymore at all. So, you try only a little bit, so you can blame your failure on the attribute that no one seems to care about: lack of motivation. The smarter you are, the less you try, because a supergenius should be able to succeed with almost no effort, right?

Plus, it's precisely because you're smart that you come to this realization early on.

Now, trying hard, being a go-getter, doing your best always, being motivated, etc.?

Work ethic is something you can control. Your self esteem is no longer tied to some fixed attribute

The only way to keep the label in this case is to actually try your best at things. In fact, you can still feel proud of yourself no matter what the outcome is. The outcome mattered in the smartness case, but here the process matters.

Lastly, so it's not something that you just happened to have at birth.

If you had been praised for being motivated, and have an influence on the world. Moreover, early 20s is all about taking your life under your control. Those who were praised for being go-getters now shine bright.

But what if you were praised for being smart? When you're in your early 20s, that you can no longer match the learning ability of your younger days, and that your worth has gone down. Now, more than ever, you shy away from trying very hard, to deny this reality and maintain the label.

Is it all the fault of the praisers? No, you're old enough to redefine those values, and there's no better time than now. After all, in the end, hard work and motivation is a far more praiseworthy thing than smartness. So stop caring if you fail and (this is the hard part) stop caring whether you remain smart in the eyes of others. In their minds, your main attribute should be that you are motivated and always trying and always going above and beyond what effort is asked of you.

A year ago today is when I finally started the uphill battle of my life. I was finishing up my 3rd year of college studying something I hated, I found out my dad was diagnosed with leukemia. My childhood dog (and best friend) had suddenly died and I was so lost. All of this caused my confidence to be at an all time low. I saw no reason to succeed at anything. I didn't go to class because I couldn't leave the house. I saw myself as an ugly fat socially awkward kid who had no job and was failing at school. I became lazy and borderline depressed. There was something wrong. My life was on a steady decline.

On May 6, I came home for good. That was the most difficult summer of my life, but it had to be done. It had to happen if I ever wanted to turn it around. I enrolled at the local community college for the fall semester. I went out every day looking for a job. And I began to exercise again. I expected to see quick results, and when they didn't come, it was hard to keep going. But I pushed myself. Focusing on the end goal; the ""pinnacle me"". As the summer progressed I saw a gradual change in my physical self and a small change in how I felt. In late August, I got a job doing what I was passionate about. The one place I wanted to work at all along finally worked out. This was huge. My confidence and mood were the best they've been since my freshman year. 

I still have that job. My GPA has never been better. And I'm playing more and more hockey. Goals 1

When the lecture ended, stressed, hungry and miserable, now I was soaking wet. I made it about 30 steps from the lecture hall when out of nowhere I felt this giant raindrop smack right into the side of my face. Only, when I went to brush it off, it turned out it wasn't a raindrop at all. 


A seagull had been flying overhead and out of the crowd of nearly 150 people around me


And that's what did it

What are the odds that all of these things happened in a row? I found it so hilarious that I burst out laughing while standing there in the street, stressed and covered in birdshit. I couldn't stop smiling for the rest of the afternoon. It was the best thing that could have happened to me and I knew it right at that instant.

But here's one thing about that success. We also have a tendency to think that the true challenge lies just around the next corner. 

Once you've lost a few pounds of fat, then you can learn guitar properly. Once you've got your internal clock sorted, then you'll apply for more jobs. 

We think of the truly hard part as being in the future, as a step along the way, toward that success, toward that state of being that we so desperately want. 

But it's not a step. Today is all there is. Right now is all there is. This is your great battle. There is no moment in your mission that will be more challenging than the one right in front of you. It's all you need to deal with. What you're thinking of

If you're looking to lose weight and you're having a craving for a candy bar

If you're looking for a job and staying up late instead of getting up early

If you're looking for more than friendship but are having trouble telling that person how you feel

The stories of our culture revolve around grand deeds. Slaying dragons, right now.

Into the greatest battle you'll ever know.

You write out your problem, so I might be getting to your video a little later than originally anticipated. 

If you decide to message me

As of today

[Here is my youtube channel](http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCP8NEQfikZawvZoxJkHGxLw?feature=mhee). I've created 2 public videos

Cheers.

**Edit #1 @ 9:44 p.m EASTERN TIME.** 
Since this thread began, and depending on how alert I am when I come back, I may record more tonight. I've been drinking a metric fuck ton of tea to give you the best possible motivational speech I can conjure up! I will be recording the majority of the day tomorrow, so rest assured your personalized motivational video is on its merry fucking way!

**Edit #2 @ 1:01 a.m EASTERN TIME**
 I took the time to read a lot of your messages so that I can literally sleep with ideas for great motivational speeches. Time for a good nights rest

Warning

**Do not let this deter you from sending me a message with your problems!** 

Cheers

**Edit #3 @ 1:35 a.m EASTERN TIME**
 I'm calling in some help! Haha, :).

**Edit #4 @ 12:57 p.m EASTERN TIME**
Heh, I found that I now have a grand total of approximately 170 requests for motivational speeches, :O. I'll do my best to record as many as I possibly can when I come back, promise.

**Edit #7 @ 10:26 p.m EASTERN TIME**
So I've decided to count the number of request I have not been able to get to as of yet

I just want to let you know that I'm in this thing for the long run. I promise I will get back to every request I receive

**Edit #8 @ 1:41 p.m EASTERN TIME Day 3**
Grr, so hopefully that can tie you over until I get to your personalized motivation speech, :).

**Edit #9 @ 11:23 p.m EASTERN TIME Day 3**
I can't believe how I'm feeling overwhelmed while simultaneously being really motivated. Since inception of this thread, there will be a personalized motivational video for you. While it may take a lot longer than expected to have a video sent to you, I will get to you.

Fuck that. I'm tired of wasting my life. This semester I'm taking calc 2, but I'm REALLY motivated to earn all A's this semester. I wake up at exactly 6:00am every day to prepare before my classes start. I'm hungry for success, I want it bad. But there are times when I get severely sidetracked by facebook and reddit.

Facebook - I spent too much trying to talk to people who no longer care about me, we see each other in real life. Or talk on the phone. It doesn't make sense for me to stay current with strangers who have no interest in me. At the end of the semester I'll activate the account again however. 

Reddit - damn. I love this site

I haven't been to the gym in a while

My whole life I've been really shy. I hated it. I couldn't make phone calls. My family would be mad at me because I'd never talk to them. I would lose friends because I wouldn't make the effort to contact them. My work life suffered. If I saw an old friend at the mall I would hide. But I thought ""that's just the way I am."" 

But a few things happened in my life that showed me that I don't have to be like that if I don't want to. 

1. On my 28th Birthday, wanted to talk and touch everyone. I was the life of the party, a social butterfly. I wanted to be like that every day. 

2. Psychology. I've always loved social sciences

3. Reddit. There's a lot of self-help subreddits that helped me. r/getmotivated, and r/seduction. I know r/seduction has a bad reputation, but it really is made for people who have anxiety and undeveloped social skills, and teaches them how to be confident. 

4. I learned to dance. This is like a booster shot of liquid self-esteem. When you're able to just flail your arms and shake your booty without a care in the world as to what other people think about it. It's really freeing. 

So in the last two years, and I've never been happier. It's fucking hard work, but omg is it worth it. 

Things I do to practice. 

- Look people in the eye when I talk to them. Always terrifying to me before

- Smile. It's cliché

- Talk to All The People! Make small talk

- Allow yourself to love yourself. Say supportive and positive things in your mind, and things like that. [Self Fulfilling Prophecies work.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-fulfilling_prophecy) (Just don't become arrogant, you will if you take it too far.)

- Start liking people more. I used think I hated people. But I think that was just my brain making excuses because it was afraid of them. I saw a quote from Niel Gaiman that really resonated with me.

&gt;""Everyone has a secret world inside of them. All the people in the whole world, magnificent, wonderful, stupid, amazing worlds.""

Sometimes

But here's the thing. Stop climbing for a second and turn around.  

Look.  

Look at how far you've already come. Look at where you started. Look at how hard it was to start this journey in the first place. Look at how steep that mountain was at times but you kept pushing through it anyway. Look at it all and be proud of yourself. Find the joy in even the smallest of accomplishments. Congratulate yourself. Pat yourself on the back

Whether you're almost at the top

If you give up, you'll have to start all over again.    

You've made it through so much already. You can't stop now. You don't want to have to start over again.   

You tripped? You messed up? You skipped a day? A week? A month? You've regressed? So

Think of future you

Don't think about your excuses. None of them are reasons.  

""Oh

""No, I...""  

""No, this JUST happened to me, and I...""  

No. You listen. You will not change unless you decide to change. Your life will not change unless you decide to change it yourself.   

There will always be reasons why you shouldn't do it. Only think of the reasons why you should.  

Change and improvement are 99% mental. Your legs will run if you tell them to. Your lips will speak if you tell them to. Your lungs will not collapse. Your arms will not fall off. Your unhealthy food/alcohol/drugs will not run away. It'll be there tomorrow. You don't need it. You don't have to have it right now. You're in control. You're the writer of your own destiny. Just do it one day at a time. You can conquer this.  

Seriously. You can't expect to knock down a wall by tapping on it. You need to get at it with full force.  

Rock on

Rock. On.

I can quit my shitty job now and not have to deal with unprofessional bosses who forget to pay me for weeks and often make me stay 4-5 hours later than scheduled.

I can finally do something directly related to my degree and lifelong interests.

My new job allows me to work with entrepreneurs all the time. This constant can only prove helpful for the future.

AND MOST IMPORTANTLY...

I WAITED UNTIL I FOUND THE RIGHT JOB

It's an entry level job - and I get to use my new-found endurance to enjoy myself as I work my way to the top.

At any point in my life I can say ""this

I was protected by my parents.

I was protected by the money I earned.

I was protected by people going easy on me.

And never did I take responsibility. Never did I work hard. Never did I do things because they needed to be done - instead I just did the minimum to get around - and for the rest found excuses.

I have lived like a child

And I am in my twenties and still I live like a child.

I complain about the things I lack - instead of working for them.

I complain about the things others don't do - instead of doing them myself.

I worry about what might come - but I don't plan anything.

I pity myself in my sadness or worries - instead of acting upon them.

I wonder why I sit alone at home - instead of going out and making friends.

I hate myself for not learning the skills or languages I want to learn - instead of making the effort.

All my life I have lived like a child. All my life I was too scared or worried or lazy or distracted or immature to stand up and say:

This is what I want

This is the person I want to meet and I will meet him.

This is the job I want and I will fight my ass off to get it.

This is the book I need to know and I will sit down and I will not eat or drink until I have finished it.

This is the world I want to conquer and I will not give up until I have conquered it.

Now is the time. Now is the time that I need to stand up and fight.

Why now?

Because else it is too late.

The longer I wait

The longer I wait

The longer I wait

The longer I wait

Today is the day I will become a man.

Today is the day I will think like a man

Today and every day from now:

I will be there for those that need me.

I will stand up for what is right.

I will do what needs to be done.

I will fight for what I want.

I will persevere

I will work even when I feel lazy.

I will do sport even when my body aches.

I will learn even when my mind feels numb.

I will meet people even when I'm scared.

I will speak when I need to speak.

I will work when I need to work.

I will be what I want to be.
