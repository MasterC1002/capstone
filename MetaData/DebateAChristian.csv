1374329307.0,1ip0tz,Fellow Christians: it's time for some tough love!,agrum_citrus,115,29,221,"I understand this is a debate subreddit

I found this subreddit a week ago and I've been lurking and learning the rules.

I've noticed there have been a few posts regarding the lack of Christian participation and Christian hurt feelings and claims that Christians are being persecuted within /r/DebateAChristian/. **As a Christian

**TO CHRISTIANS**

* From an atheist's perspective, we are participating in a debate because we choose to. We can walk away at any time.

* Let's get one thing clear: God has NOT been definitively proven to exist and you can not pretend otherwise during rational debate!

* We are receiving down-votes because our debate arguments are often unsubstantiated. We are being ridiculed because rational debate ends once we make these unsubstantiated claims (which typically presumes that Christianity can be proven). **This is THE key issue.** If we want to be taken seriously

* If you are not an expert in ancient Hebrew or Greek and you do not have access to the original Old Testament or New Testament then **DO NOT CLAIM THAT YOUR BIBLICAL INTERPRETATIONS ARE MORE CORRECT THAN SOMEONE ELSE'S** *(unless you can actually substantiate it)* because you can not substantiate your claim. You will be down-voted

* Debate arguments and rebuttals need to be rational. We deserve to be ridiculed (within a debate) if our argument are unsubstantiated such as ""because the bible tells me so"" or ""because God can do no wrong"" or ""Jesus died for our sins"" etc.

* I am sick of Christian whining about being persecuted and how the /r/DebateAChristian is unfair. Stop your complaining and present some decent, or do not participate! We can not expect non-believers to respect our unsubstantiated religious views within a debate unless we can present a decent argument in support of said claims!

* Remember that we will not die from hurt feelings.

**TO ATHEISTS**

* Nobody has proven nor disproved the existence of God. It is irrational to claim to know of sure

* If you are interested in having a serious debate

**MY DEBATE QUESTION**

  When I went to a Christian College we read the ""Old Testament"" in the order the Jewish people read them (TaNaKh, Ketuvim, Torah, Prophets, Writings) and it was pretty damn clear to me at that time the central concern at all times was the preservation of their land. Nothing more. In fact the end of the Hebrew canon is closed by a recap of Jewish history in 1 and 2 Chronicles, and after reading a giant back and forth of the Jewish people living and getting expelled from Palestine, it ends with the Persian King Cyrus making a ""happy ending"" and giving the land back to the Isaelites and rebuilding the temple destroyed by the Babylonians, tying the Messiah to a physical act of regaining land

  What's really interesting was how the Old Testament came to be reordered. Alexandrian king Ptolemy the II oversaw the height of literary achievement and thus commissioned a greek translation of the Hebrew text from occupied Palestine. Now the Talmud (Jewish oral history/exploration of laws, far after Ptolemy and the influence of Hellenism in Judea into the Herodian occupation which continued through the times of Jesus. We can tell the standards of transliteration were becoming more flexible as time went on. The Septuagint incorporates texts that were not in the original canon of the Tanakh and are known now as Apocryphal, almost wholly rejected by the Protestant church. 

  While the exact reasoning for the reordering of the text is not known, whilst Christianity, with a god of the universe, as opposed to god of the strip of eastern Mediterranean coastline, is capable of opening its arms to everyone. Undoubtedly that's what Constantine must have found most useful about the religion after he relaxed the laws against Christianity with the edict of Milan. Despite the fact that he maintained a more pluralistic approach to religion in the empire early on, later in his reign he was going as far as North Africa to judge over doctrinal disputes of theology and even waging war to impose his decrees. The council of Nicea becomes very important politically to consolidating power in a reign plagued by rebellion and civil war and what we know as Christianity today stems from these very unchristian motivations.

  Thus, and Christianity is simply a platonic expansion of that text based on a loose translation into greek with political/philosophical edits which are later imposed by a politically motivated board charged with forming consistent doctrine for the Roman emperor trying to maintain control of an expansive and divisive empire.",,False,,t5_2ryd5,True,,
1371319044.0,1gera8,I don't understand Jesus's sacrifice. It seems irrelevant in the context of who's making the sacrifice.,EpsilonRose,44,5,165,"So

The basic gist of my problem is as follows: It is often claimed that god sacrificed Jesus for our sins and, so we should be greatful. Often phrases like ""God sacrificed his only begotten son for your sins"" and ""extreme personal sacrifice"" are used to describe the event and explain how people feel about it. Unfortunately, neither of those phrases seem to accurately describe what happened. While it can easily be argued, if you believe in Christianity, that we should be grateful for the result of the sacrifice, the sacrifice itself seems rather trivial. To my eyes, there are four major problems with the sacrifice. The first three have to do with its nature and the final one has to do with it's context. I would greatly appreciate hearing people's thoughts on this matter.

---

**First is the issue of scale.**  
God is credited with creating the universe. That means, 13.77 **Billion** years ago, to the present (or the time of Jesus, if you prefer, a couple thousand years isn't worth much on this scale). Jesus lived for about 30 years. This represents 2.179E-7%, or .00000002179%, of his existence. If we were to put this on a human scale, if we use the average life expectancy of an American citizen (79 years according to Wikipedia). Of course, it counts the whole of Jesus's life

**Next is scope.**  
As an omniscient entity, as tranquil as interstellar space or a barren planet (with atmosphere), and as violent as a solar system getting destroyed by an exploding star. I find it hard to believe that mortal humans, especially during Jesus's time, could create or experience events that would be described as 'extreme' when taken on that stage. I could certainly understand calling the experience unpleasant, but but only in a mildly less than neutral way. When cosmic level events are included, I can think of plenty of things that would be worse than getting nailed to a cross and, an omniscient being should know what it's like to experience those things.

**After that
Normally, it is a permanent thing. This is explicitly not the case with god and Jesus. In fact, one of the central tenants of Christianity is that god promptly undid the loss by resurrecting Jesus and bringing him back home.

---
**Summary of first three issues.**  
God's sacrifice of Jesus only looks like an extreme personal sacrifice if we judge it as if god were a human. If we actually take the time to put it into perspective

In that light

Personally

---
**The final issue is a matter of context.**  
God is sacrificing Jesus to modify a situation that he created and to change his own policies. Hell and sin were both created by god and the judging of a human life is supposedly god's domain. Asking someone to be grateful for that is like asking someone to be grateful for Steve Jobs paying Steve Jobs to change the iTunes drm policy.

""Believe me when I say that I am in the Father and the Father is in me; or at least believe on the evidence of the miracles themselves."" (John 14:11)

Christians point to another primary ""proof"" of Jesus' identity as God and Messiah: the fulfillment of Old Testament prophecy. But anyone could have written Jesus stories to ""fulfill"" Old Testament prophecies.

Is there anything else that Jesus could have done (short of never leaving Earth) to ""prove"" he was God?

Jesus could have uttered some prophecies that would not be revealed until hundreds of years later. 

Jesus could have made some general comments about how it is that the earth orbits the sun in a solar system consisting of nine planets. He could have mentioned gravity

Jesus expected people to believe he was God based on a few parlor tricks.

Imagine what a slam dunk it would be for Christianity if the creator of the universe revealed just a few of his secrets hundreds of years before they were discovered by humans. Imagine how many more souls would be saved. 

But Jesus didn't reveal any special knowledge of the natural world. Instead, astronomy or physics than any other man on the street in 1st century Judea. Why is that?

Please don't respond with, Jesus' comments about scientific matters could have been made for people in the future, not for people alive in his own time.

1314059478.0,jr5bx,"""Chrestos"" in the Codex Sinaiticus: The smoking gun.",Basilides,33,3,11,"The earliest secular document recording the existence of Chrestians has this to say....

""...Nero fastened the guilt and inflicted the most exquisite tortures on a class hated for their abominations, suffered the extreme penalty during the reign of Tiberius at the hands of one of our procurators, Pontius Pilatus,...""

(Tacitus, book 15, chapter 44)

Christian apologists like to believe that ""Chrestians"" and ""Chrestus"" in the above text are just insignificant mispellings. But the earliest copy of the Bible in existence

""As to the ancient manuscripts, has instead of Christianoi (Xristianoi/), Chrestianoi (Xrhstianoi/) – and it has this reading in all three places where the word occurs.  Therefore it is impossible, in spite of the Nestle-Aland tentative suggestion for Acts 26:28, for it to be an itacism (i.e., a popular misspelling based on third/fourth century shifts in pronunciation, something of which this manuscript is, replete). For one thing, the empty space left by the erasure is, Annales 15.4

http://ichthys.com/mail-the-name-Christian.htm

The two titles ""Chrestus"" or ""Chrestian"" are referred to in the following written sources: Tertullian (AD 210), Marcus (AD 145), Apocalypse of Elijah (AD 100), Suetonius (AD 124) and Tacitus (AD 116). There is even a disputed inscription (now lost) from Pompei (AD 79) that is believed to have contained a reference to this lost title of Jesus.

Again

Why is this important?

""Firstly the hero of Marcion's Bible was called Isu Chrestos - not Jesus. An important point here is you don't see ""Jesus Christ"" in second century texts. So in the Bible of Marcion of Sinope ""Isu Chrestos"" appears instead of ""Christ"" and ""Jesus"". Also in the archaeological fragments mentioned earlier the scribes used the letters ""IS"" wherever Jesus Christ now appears. The inscription ""Isu Chrestos"" can still be seen on the oldest surviving Christian ""Synagogue"" in Syria.

http://www.marcion.info/

Marcion's Jesus appeared full grown on earth during the 15th year of the reign of Tiberius. Marcion's Jesus had no human family and only appeared to be a human being. Marcion's Jesus only ""appeared"" to be crucified. Marcion's Jesus only appeared to die. Marcion's Jesus only appeared to be resurrected. Marcion's Jesus was a god totally separate from the evil Yahweh

The earliest date we have for Marcion is Polycarp's comment that Marcion was teaching in 115 AD. But use of the word ""Chrestus"" precedes Marcion by 65 to 75 years. It would seem, the date Polycarp was willing to admit Marcion arrived on the scene? 

Writing in 138 AD, the god of the Chrestians as long ago as 40 AD...just seven years after the alleged crucifixion of Christ and a good two decades before Paul arrived in Rome.

""Nobody knows how the Church of Rome was established. Neither the Book of Acts nor the writings of the early Fathers explain how Christianity arrived in Rome. As has been discovered, mentions the **expulsion of followers of Chrestus from Rome, during the time of Emperor Claudius c. AD 40-50**. This indicates that **a flourishing Christian community existed in Rome, even before Paul went to Corinth or Ephesus in AD 49**. By the time of Nero (AD 54-68), the Christian community in Rome was already of a considerable size.""

http://www.firstnewtestament.com/origin_name_christian.htm

Long before Paul

How did ""Christianity"" reach Rome at that very early date and before Paul? 

Could this ""Chrestianity"" referred to by Suetonius be something other than what we have come to understand as Christianity today? 

Could ""Chrestianity"" represent the original orthodoxy of what we now call Christianity?

""According to Clement of Alexandria, ch. 17. 106f.). That educated scholar from Alexandria (Clement) represents Marcion as an ""elder"" predecessor to two early Gnostic teachers, Valentinus and Basilides. Another heresiarch, Simon Magus, who is often portrayed as the grand father of Gnosticism, also is described by Clement as succeeding Marcion. ""This statement of Clement appears to make Marcion an old man while (Basilides and) Valentinus were still young, and to put Simon Magus posterior to them all in time"" (Robert Smith Wilson. Marcion: A Study of a Second-Century Heretic. James Clarke and Co. Ltd. 1932. p. 56). Clement's chronological data is not being so readily dismissed today

http://www.sullivan-county.com/id2/marcion.htm

It would seem that the *earliest* expression of what we call ""Christianity"" was not what we know it to be today. It would appear that once the Catholics gained supremacy

Later Christian scribes literally erased the ""e"" from ""Chrestus"" and ""Chrestianos"" and replaced it with an ""i"". And

But, Chrestos, the God of Marcion.

**TL;DR** If Christians are going to give weight to Tacitus as a historical source and say he is correct and knows what he’s talking about…especially if they are going to say he got his info from authentic governmental documents…then Christians have to also accept that the theology found in Marcionism came *before* the theology found in Catholic orthodoxy.

1297450560.0,fjm6f,A historian's view of how the story of Jesus's resurrection got started.,lanemik,38,6,171,"This is from [Bart Ehrman's debate with William Lane Craig](http://www.philvaz.com/apologetics/p96.htm#EhrmanClose).

&gt;Let me conclude by telling you what I really do think about Jesus' resurrection. The one thing we know about the Christians after the death of Jesus is that they turned to their scriptures to try and make sense of it. They had believed Jesus was the Messiah, prior to Christianity, thought that the Messiah was to be crucified. The Messiah was to be a great warrior or a great king or a great judge. He was to be a figure of grandeur and power, not somebody who's squashed by the enemy like a mosquito. How could Jesus, the Messiah, have been killed as a common criminal? Christians turned to their scriptures to try and understand it, and they found passages that refer to the Righteous One of God's suffering death. But in these passages, the one who is punished or who is killed is also vindicated by God. Christians came to believe their scriptures that Jesus was the Righteous One and that God must have vindicated him.

&gt;And so Christians came to think of Jesus as one who, much as Elijah and Enoch had in the Hebrew scriptures. How can he be Jesus the Messiah though, if he's been exalted to heaven? Well, Jesus must be coming back soon to establish the kingdom. He wasn't an earthly Messiah; he's a spiritual Messiah. That's why the early Christians thought the end was coming right away in their own lifetime. That's why Paul taught that Christ was the first fruit of the resurrection. But if Jesus is exalted, he is no longer dead, and so Christians started circulating the story of his resurrection. It wasn't three days later they started circulating the story; it might have been a year later, maybe two years. Five years later they didn't know when the stories had started. Nobody could go to the tomb to check; the body had decomposed.

&gt;Believers who knew he had been raised from the dead started having visions of him. Others told stories about these visions of him, narratives were constructed and circulated and eventually we got the Gospels of the New Testament written 30, 40, 50, 60 years later.

For example, that would be impossible. I could TELL you that I believe in God, I can lie to everyone about it, but I cannot lie to myself, I would always know the truth.

I suspect it is the same for people who do believe in God

These beliefs, and to portray them this way, as many people do over and over again on these debate forums, is damaging to intellectual conversation.

I can understand why you would say this. Simply by saying it, care about me. You care that I am on the wrong path, that I am lost.

I hope I've adequately demonstrated my understanding of the phrase. Please tell me in the comments if I'm way off. But assuming we're still on the same page

While you do not share my views, prayer does nothing, literally nothing. Just words. I mean no disrespect, but you know that I consider your prayers to be as useful as wishing on a star. Secondly, You could have prayed for me without telling me and it wouldn't have made a difference, unless you believe that prayer's effect is influenced by whether or not its subject is cognisant of its invocation (I've never met anyone who believes this). Knowing these two things, why did you tell me? Who was the phrase actually meant for? Not for me, selfless gesture for me. By telling me that you'll pray for me

Additionally, whether they were valid or not - instead, simplifying the conversation down to a failure on my (and/or your) part, that requires prayer to resolve. This is naturally very frustrating, especially if I have invested a lot of thought into the conversation.

I mean no matter where my parents were raised or what label they put on themselves (Christian, alcoholic, etc.) they would have found a way to avoid truly engaging life and accepting themselves and others for who they truly are.

The only way i could make sense of this is if you either dont beleive in hell, i'm convinced that anyone who truly beleives that a person deserves to suffer for infinite time for finite sins is a sociopath who lacks any sense of genuine empathy or understanding. Because look at it this way, is it justice that they deserve, or is it really your own desire for vengeance and sadism, fluctuated from your own hate and anger? You may think that there are people who deserve their come up ons, but is it worth the price of the innocent ones who love them and are separated from them. If this is what is really going on in death, than i dont think anyone really finds peace in the afterlife (cept for people in heaven who are indifferent to the plight of others)

Believers obviously see MANY prophecies as being fulfilled

At the very least



INTRODUCTION: I've read and heard a lot about how there are so many biblical prophecies that have come true

I just don't see it.  I have yet to see anything prophecied in the Bible that is not circular logic and it simply fulfils its own earlier predictions.

I would like a Christian to enlighten me and provide an example of a biblical prophecy that has come true in the time since the bible was written (circa 100 AD).  Any prophecies cited should be accompanied by an explanation of how that prophecy was divinely inspired and not simply an educated guess of man.  For example

In debate style

Please rebut.

EDIT: 

I would like to be clear of the criteria that I would accept as being ""valid prophecy"" at which time I would agree that my proposal/hypothesis would be invalidated and I would agree that the bible contains at least one valid prophecy:

- (a) The prophecy describes an event that is clear and not simply a vague guess that someone living 2000 years ago could have easily predicted (e.g. ""There will be a war""

- (b) Metaphorical prophecies by their very nature are so vague as to be immediately rejected for the above reason.

- (c) There must have been some precognition involved in the prophecy such that a supreme being would have provided knowledge or insight.  Details should have been provided that could not possibly have been known beforehand.

- (d) The date of writing predates the event

- (e) The events actually happened in their entirety

- (f) Although I'm willing to relax this one a little

1301245759.0,gckgc,The gospel according to Paul only,Basilides,32,9,40,"If you analyze Paul's writings in isolation

1) At an unspecified time or place

Whenever Paul refers to someones birth (Rom. 9:11
 
It seems a stretch to think that it's merely chance that Paul uses a different word for ""born"" only when referring to Jesus.

Therefore

2)  in Paul's writings

3) Betrayed by a party/parties unknown

4) At an unspecified time or place, buried and rose again on the third day. Again, Paul's lamb could have been slain, literally, from the foundation of the world.

5) If Paul's Jesus really was killed in 1st century Judea...he should not have said that the government that killed Jesus was justified in doing so.

For rulers hold no terror for those who do right, for rulers do not bear the sword for no reason. They are God’s servants, agents of wrath to bring punishment on the wrongdoer. (Romans 13)

From reading the above you'd almost think that Paul's Jesus was not killed by the Roman government.

6) Post-resurrection

7) Paul's Jesus did not receive his name while in his mother's womb. Paul's Jesus received the name ""Jesus"" as a result of being crucified. (Philippians 2:9-10)

8) For Paul

9) Paul's Jesus only appeared in the likeness of flesh (Philippians 2:7

To argue that Jesus can appear in the ""likeness of flesh"" and actually *be in the flesh* is to completely disregard the meaning of the phrase ""likeness of flesh"".

""When God created man

Was man God because he was in the ""likeness of God""? Of course not. Similarly, in the ""likeness of flesh"".

Paul's Jesus was not God in the flesh. 

As further evidence of this consider that the Jews did not accuse Paul of referring to a recently deceased man as the incarnation of God on earth. Also consider that while Paul referred to Jesus as a ""man"" (Romans 5:17), Paul's second man, Jesus, is of heaven, not of the earth.

Philo:

""There are two kinds of men. The one is Heavenly Man, but that he was stamped with the image of God, whereas the earthly man is a creature and not the offspring of the Creator."" (From Allegorical Interpretation of the Law)
 
""...flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God; neither doth corruption inherit incorruption."" (1 Corinthians 15:50)

""For this corruptible must put on incorruption

What is corruptible is flesh and blood. What is incorruptible is something other than flesh and blood.

Paul's Jesus was not corruptible. Paul's Jesus was not flesh and blood.

12) Paul credits his Jesus with only three teachings

13) Aside from the above

- Bethlehem (Jesus' birthplace)
- a place called 'Nazareth' (as in ""Jesus of Nazareth"")
- a Roman census 
- parents named Mary and Joseph
- angelic visitations to both Mary and Joseph
- the Virgin Birth 
- the Slaughter of the Innocents
- the Magi (they were magically summoned to meet the baby Jesus)
- John the Baptist 
- Jesus' baptism
- Jesus' career as a carpenter 
- Galilee 
- Jesus' itinerant preaching ministry in Judea (didn't Paul the apostle know about this?!)
- Disciples (Paul
- that Jesus was a teacher of morals 
- that Jesus taught in parables
- The Sermon on the Mount
- Jesus' prayers
- Jesus' many miracles (Paul nowhere has his Jesus turn water into wine,000 or walking on lakes)
- Jesus' healings and cures (no mention of the blind receiving their sight
- Jesus' exorcisms
- Jesus' temptation in the wilderness
- Mary Magdalene
- Nicodemus (mentioned only in the gospel of John)
- Judas Iscariot (a key player in the lead-up to the passion story)
- Gethsemane (and Jesus' hesitation there)
- a trial before Pilate
- Peter's repeated denials (wouldn't Galatians 2 have been a perfect opportunity for Paul to throw this in Peter's face?)
- Jesus' flogging 
- Jesus' crucifixion outside the walls of Jerusalem 
- a place called ""Calvary"" (mentioned only in Luke 23:33)
- the two malefactors condemned with Jesus
- Jesus' words from the cross
- the spear thrust in Jesus' side
- the darkness over the earth
- the earthquake
- the rising of the saints mentioned only in Matthew 27:52-53 
- Joseph of Arimathaea
- Golgotha
- female witnesses
- an empty tomb 
- Doubting Thomas
- The Great Commission. Regarding Jesus' choice of disciples Paul says, at the renewal of all things, when the Son of Man sits on his glorious throne, you who have followed me will also sit on twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel."" (Matthew 19:28)
- The Ascension

Now the explanation I usually get for this is that congregations in the far flung towns of Corinth and Rome etc. already knew the gospel story and all of Jesus' teachings chapter and verse and had no need to have any of it repeated back to them. But if this is true then we must believe that these congregants knew everything about Jesus and what would become the NT but little to nothing about the OT because

I think the explanation for all of this is that, not in Jerusalem but, from the foundation of the world was already well-developed. But the story of one Jesus of Nazareth had yet to be created. 

Paul himself said that he received his gospel ""from no man"" (Galatians 1:11-12). Yet there were supposedly gospel stories floating around which

Did Paul willfully ignore the sacred stories and teachings that eventually found their way into the four gospels? Or did the sacred stories and teachings found in the four gospels not yet exist *in any form*

Conclusion: Paul's Jesus was not Jesus of Nazareth.

1329429207.0,pswgr,Why was Celsus criticizing the same things about Christianity in 177 that today's anti-theists do?,MJtheProphet,28,6,34,"Early Christianity had its critics

The most notable of these critics is probably Celsus, his work is preserved with some accuracy as Origen's rebuttal depended on not attacking a straw man, and he drew on an apparently deep knowledge of the Old and New Testaments and personal experiences rather than the hearsay of some other Christian detractors of the time.  The Wikipedia article on [The True Word](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_True_Word) goes into pretty good detail, and his arguments sound shockingly familiar:

&gt;In his opinion Christian theology was based on an amalgamation of false eastern philosophical ideas hastily tied together. He stated that Christians would “weave together erroneous opinions drawn from ancient sources and trumpet them aloud”.  Celsus gave a point by point critique of Christian doctrine, as even Jews at that time were saying the same. The remainder of Christian stories – what now makes up the Christian Bible- Celsus found very insipid and unappealing compared to Greek and Roman legends of powerful and colorful gods. Celsus also found Christian philosophy lacking when compared to secular philosophy, and declared that “things are stated much better among the Greeks”.

&gt;...

&gt;Celsus could deduce no explanation for the actions of the Christian God, and the introduction of evil into the world, except that God wanted to draw attention to his greatness because he felt humanity was giving him “less than his due”.  Celsus concluded that Christians used the explanation of God ""testing"" them to disguise the fact that their God was not powerful enough to successfully fight Satan, but was instead “helpless”.  Celsus wrote that Satan was either a mortal invention used by Christians to frighten others into believing their philosophies and joining them, or if he did indeed exist then he was proof that God was not all-powerful, but rather a weak lesser god and a bad one, for only a vindictive and insecure being would punish mankind for being tricked by an evil that he has been too weak to stop.  The apparent “blind faith” of the Christians was bewildering to Celsus, **the main tenet of Christianity was “Do not ask questions

&gt;...

&gt;Celsus’ main argument against Christianity, whose adherents, although living within the Empire, had already revolted against Roman rule several times. The Christian community then became further divided amongst themselves, and Celsus complained that “matters are determined in different ways by the various sects”.  This dissension between different factions within Christianity proved to the Romans that Christians who could not even draw together under their own shared beliefs were naturally a divisive people and not only caused friction within their own philosophy but would disrupt the unity of the Empire. Finally Celsus and other Roman writers believed that “Christians are dangerous precisely because they put the advancement of their beliefs above the common good and the welfare of the state”.

Inconsistent origin story, using the threat of Satan/hell to scare converts into believing, the stupidity of blind faith, the danger that it poses to society, fear that Christians will put their beliefs over what is beneficial to the state, etc.  Today's atheists and anti-theists are making the **exact same arguments**, and Celsus wrote in about 177.  I've made many of the same arguments myself, other than killing their critics.  Truly,,red brackets

First of all, that is one thing, but to show disrespect and still expect them to visit this subreddit is ridiculous. 

Another reason, a typical thing I have seen in this subreddit is that Christian answers often receive downvotes because you disagree with them even if they have taken a lot of time and put thought into their answers. Of course you are going to disagree with them, but it can just be disappointing to spend ½ hour constructing a comment with links and quotes only to finish a few votes in the negative. If someone makes an attempt to give a thought out answer, they deserve an upvote. Likewise, it just seems like an atheist discussion when we view an answer and an atheist response agreeing with the OP is voted to the top. It doesn’t seem like you really want a debate when you upvote those comments, just wanting an added assurance that your objection is valid and disproves Christianity without any debate. 

Lastly on this, “Well Christians have done bad things in history and therefore you are a terrible person so I am right and you are wrong” which never addresses the question at hand. 

Lastly, move to the comments, sees another Christian give an intelligent answer that they agree with and have nothing more to add to, and they move on. Just work with the Christian answers you get because they will a lot of the times represent the majority of Christian comments you would receive. 

Keeping these things in mind when you write will make this community more active and allow more Christians to come here to comment.

It seems to me that the only evidence for Christianity is The Bible. It's generally accepted by Christians that the Bible is the word of God and is proof of God's and Jesus' existence.

Here's the list:

&gt;1. Find what the article is about. Find the major subject matter. Define the problem(s) the blogger is trying to solve or setting and try to correctly outline the whole article.

&gt;2. Come to terms with the blogger by interpreting his key words

&gt;3. Know the blogger’s arguments by finding them in

&gt;4. Do not begin criticism until you have completed reading and rereading the article, disagree, or suspend judgment, until you can say “I understand.”- Mortimer J. Adler

&gt;5. Do not disagree disputatiously or contentiously.

&gt;6. Demonstrate that you recognize the difference between knowledge and mere personal opinion by presenting good reasons for any critical judgment you make.

&gt;7. When criticizing, misinformed, illogical or incomplete.

&gt;8. Avoid disagreeing on minor details.

&gt;9. “Pick your battles”. Do not comment on the topic you are not familiar with. Study

Some Christian rebuttals to my argument that I have seen and found unconvincing:

* ""All of our sins are forgiven through Jesus Christ, as it can overcome any sin we commit on earth, which I think is somewhat ridiculous - my choosing to not believe in Jesus does no one any harm, no one here on earth and certainly not an omnipotent God.

Essentially what I’m trying to understand is how this relates to original sin.

What it sounds like to me is that every human born carries the weight of this original sin. They are infected by evil and will therefore commit evil in their lives. This results in their inability to connect with god (and/or results in being sent to hell depending on who I talk to). Here’s my problem: I didn’t commit the original sin. Neither did anyone I have ever heard of. Most people agree that Adam and Eve didn’t literally exist. How is it that I am being held responsible for something that I (or anyone that actually exists) did? How is it that we deserve punishment (or at least don’t deserve the reward) for something that I was born with?

It is not hard to come up with an alternate scenario. We could all have been born and raised in the Garden of Eden and only be kicked out once each of us had eaten fruit.  Then everyone would actually have a say in whether they commit original sin. 


TL;DR Why is original sin inherited and how is that just?

1329925630.0,q108m,A few thoughts on the Fall of Man,Basilides,25,7,31,"**1) Christians say all humans born after Adam were ""afflicted"" by original sin because of the separation between the Christian God and Man.**

But the Christian god created the entire universe. Christians are arguing that the Christian god made part of creation

**2) Christians say that the Christian god wants to repair the bond with humans.**

But the Christian god created the natural order, can alter the natural order by un-creating the consequences of Adam's action just as he altered the natural order by, for example, un-creating the natural consequences of:

* a horde of people marching into the Red Sea
* a man being eaten by a fish 
* a man being executed

**3) Christians say that the Christian god wants to repair the bond with each one of us

But according to Paul, the Christian god surrounds each one of us with sin and deliberately infects each one of us with a sinful nature. He puts each one of us *as far away from him as possible*, assuming he is not as evil as the world he has put us in.

**4) Christians say we were given free will in the first place because the Christian god wanted us to choose to love him.**

But *no one chooses* to have a sinful nature. God made Adam and Eve *without* a sinful nature. What was wrong with the way the Christian god made Adam and Eve? Apparently

In fact what kind of sick love is it when the one who loves you is so butt hurt by one mistake that he banishes his loved ones and all of their descendants from his sight forever? I wouldn't do that to my kids or my descendants. Would you?

**5) Christians make a big deal about free will.** 

But free will necessitates *the ability to make an informed decision*. The Christian god withheld information from Adam and Eve. Information which the serpent revealed. The serpent revealed, indeed, make Adam and Eve like gods. So who really respected the free will of Adam and Eve? The Christian god or the serpent?

**6) Adam and Eve

If Adam and Eve ""knew exactly what they were doing"" then neither one of them were deceived. But the Bible says otherwise.

And Adam was not the one deceived; it was the woman who was deceived and became a sinner. (1 Tim 2:24)

So the Christian god punishes all of us with a sinful nature and with death because he failed to adequately coach Eve about the serpent and because a husband listened to his wife. It's hard to avoid the sexism of this story: The husband is guided by God. The wife is guided by Satan.

If these damned infants are happy and united to God, for surely Satan does not want that!

We will read from a Catholic book, authorized by Pope Innocent VIII, was written by Frs. Kramer and Sprenger, Dominican Inquistors, whose specialty was exposing and defeating the heresy and evils of witchcraft:

MM: “For nearly three centuries *Malleus Maleficarum (the Witches’ Hammer)* was the professional manual for witch hunters. This work by two of the most famous Inquisitors of the age is still a document of force... Under a Bull of Pope Innocent VIII, and the will of God.”

This work teaches that Satan desires to kill unbaptized babies so they can suffer pain in hell for all eternity:

MM: “Moreover (as was said in the First Part of the work), that **the greatest injuries to the Faith as regards the heresy of witches are done by midwives**; and this is made clearer than daylight itself by the confessions of some who were afterwards burned. For in the diocese of Basel at the town of Dann, a witch who was burned confessed that she had killed more than forty children, by sticking a needle through the crowns of their heads into their brains, as they came out from the womb...[60] Now the reason for such practices is as follows: It is to be presumed that witches are compelled to do such things at the command of evil spirits, and sometimes against their own wills. For the devil knows that, because of the pain of loss, such children are debarred from entering the Kingdom of Heaven.”[61] (Part II

Hence infants who died with original sin are in the hell of the damned and suffer the pain of loss in the very least. And I believe they also suffer a degree of corporal pain by hell fire. Consequently, and are not happy but suffer eternal pain.""

[Damned Infants](http://www.romancatholicism.org/ibranyi-damned-infants.htm#_Toc223506322)

Ok

TRANSCRIPT:

&gt;Brian challenged us to a debate about the Bible

&gt;OPPENHEIMER: It is OK.

&gt;SAVAGE: You know, “In the beginning,” let’s begin with the beginning of the Bible—you get two conflicting, contradictory creation narratives right off the bat. Chapter 1 of Genesis and chapter 2 of Genesis, most Biblical scholars believe are two different creation narratives that have just been piggybacked together, or set side-by-side. Most people read them uncritically and don’t notice that everything’s created in a different order and for a different reason. At the end of the first creation narrative in Genesis, God creates “humankind.” Not Adam and Eve, male and female, in a different order. Man is created first and placed in what must have been a very depressing garden because God had not yet created plants. He places man in a garden and then creates plants. And then God says

&gt;And why does He create Eve? To create a co-parent for Adam? No, before they get down to the being fruitful and multiplying, is the original purpose of Eve’s is companionship, because it is not good for man to be alone. The contradictions—and of course, both of these stories, these creation narratives, can’t be literally true. I think if you’re a Christian, the inerrant word of God, “Here are two beautiful stories

&gt;The contradictions continue. “Thou shalt not kill”—the Israelites spend a whole lot of time killing people on God’s orders. Jesus says the old law must be followed; Paul contradicts him.

&gt;The one place, whom you may have: You may buy male and female slaves from the nations that are around you. They may be your property. You may bequeath them to your sons after you to inherit as a possession forever.” In the New Testament, Timothy: “Let all who are under the yoke of slavery regard their masters as worthy of all honor so that the name of God and the teaching may not be defamed. If anyone teaches otherwise, and does not agree with the sound words of our Lord Jesus Christ and the teaching which accords with Godliness, he is puffed up with conceit; he knows nothing.” This is a verse that was thrown in the face of American abolitionists, before and during the second—or the Civil War. The Reverend Richard Fuller, president of the Southern Baptist Convention, with a straight face and because it’s true

&gt;Like I said to the high school journalism students, says the Bible got the easiest moral question that humanity has ever faced wrong, and that was slavery. And my—[?]—my point was that the Bible, if it got something as easy and obvious as slavery wrong, what are the odds that the Bible got something as complicated as human sexuality wrong? I put those odds at about 100 percent. Pat Robertson was recently asked about this. I don’t know if you saw that clip? [Brown shakes his head.] On the—his show, he was asked if America was founded as a Christian nation, why did we allow slavery? And he answer was, if you read the Bible

&gt;I don’t think LGBT Americans are asking American Christians to do anything that you haven’t already done. Move in your conception of the value of human beings. In this instance, bisexual, or transgendered. Many American Christians—we know you can move, because many American Christians have already moved in their value of the conception of human beings, because many American Christians, including a majority of American Catholics, support marriage rights for—support same-sex—rights for same-sex couples. Not a majority for marriage, all incidents of marriage, to change their perspective on the morality of what it means to be gay. Just to sign off on our full civil equality. Tolerate doesn’t mean celebrate; tolerate means endure or put up with. And I think that Christians—conservative Christians—can learn to tolerate legal civil same-sex marriage the way they’ve learned to tolerate legal divorce

&gt;You know, a pro-gay-marriage Christian blogger and author, he says that the Bible has no place in a conversation about the legality or illegality of gay marriage. Illegal is not a religious term. In a pluralistic society, you know, people are free to live their religious values. And I believe people are free to proselytize. If somebody wants to talk me out of my marriage to Terry, I think that they should knock themselves out. I don’t think that they have a right to use the law to do that, to deny us equal protection under the law because of their interpretation of the Bible, as you’ve attempted to redefine it.

2. Is the God who ordered this man be stoned the same God you worship in church on Sundays?

So, the arguments against the divine origin of the Bible or the incompatibility of God and evil are moot and the Christian philosopher walks away triumphant. However, appeals to ignorance are not accepted when inconvenient for the Christian philosopher, with regard to the origin of the universe specifically.

William Lane Craig has simply declared the issue settled in the second premise of his Teleological Argument when we really know almost nothing about it. Dozens of unprovable and unfalsifiable science based philosophical speculations about the origin of the universe are dismissed with the little or no justification or suggested to be absurd with little or no justification. Why is the non-Christian required to scientifically demonstrate them to be true before we accept the idea that they COULD be true?

What if I speculated that through some unknown and untestable natural law, primordial vacuum that contained only quantum phenomena and natural laws, in what can be described as “empty” space, spontaneously spawned a multiverse of 10 to the 500th universes with one and only one for each possible variation of the fundamental constants. None of the universes interact with each other in any major way and can exist in the same “space” as each other. There will be an untold number of universes that have the right ratios of fundamental constants to support our kind of life and each of these universes could have beings like us in them wondering how it all happened.

Jim Morrison himself believed he was a sort of a shaman and that spirits used him for his music. His producer Paul Rothschild said that the most pivotal part of his life is when this spirit entered him. This is all stated in the book ""Break on Through: The Life and Death of Jim Morrison"". At Venice Beach before he became famous he said ""In that year there was an intense visitation of energy. I left school and went down to the beach to live. slept on a roof...

Jimmy Page , Hammer of the Gods, p. 262). In one of their songs when played backwards you can actually hear demonic messages

Bob Dylan implied he made a deal with the Devil whom he called chief

Katy Perry admitted she sold her soul to the devil.

Most of rock music and the culture it promotes are of things against God or good

David Bowie in Rolling Stone magazine (Feb. 12, when he stated:
""Rock has always been THE DEVIL'S MUSIC . . . I believe rock and roll is dangerous . . . I feel we're only heralding SOMETHING EVEN DARKER THAN OURSELVES.""

Little Richard has testified that rock music is demonic:

""My true belief about Rock 'n' Roll--and there have been a lot of phrases attributed to me over the years--is this: I believe this kind of music is demonic. ... A lot of the beats in music today are taken from voodoo, you'll see that is true. I believe that kind of music is driving people from Christ. It is contagious"" (Little Richard, quoted by Charles White, The Life and Times of Little Richard, p. 197).

""I was directed and commanded by another power. The power of darkness ... The power that a lot of people don't believe exists. The power of the Devil. Satan"" (Little Richard,206).

Eminem said he sold his soul in his rap song ""Goodbye Hollywood""

""What about math
It's like the boy in the bubble
If I could go back
I sold my soul to the devil
I just wanna leave this game with level head intact""

Also in his song ""My Darling he retells the deal he had with the devil.

In his autobiography ""The Doggfather""
to him to make a deal that he would be rich and famous in exchange for
his soul. Snoop accepted the devil's offer (by his own words) and identifies that the point at which Calvin Broadus dies Snoop Dog was born.

FROM THE SONG ""LET ME FLY"". In this song

""I sold my soul to the devil, what the deal is a mystery. How is it I can live and make history If you don't see it then it, wasn't ment for you to see
If you wasn't born wit' it then, you take away that and I'm gone ""

A former Satan worshiper



The Eagles were involved with the Church of Satan 
The so called father of Rock and Roll Robert Johnson believed to sold his soul for guitar playing abilities and fame 
Jimi Hendrex believed he was possessed by demonic spirits. His girlfriend admitted it as well. 
Michael Jackson was heavily involved in the occult. He admitted he had a room full of mirrors so he could communicate with a spirit. Jackson said he would go to sleep for days with the aid of drugs so he can get songs from the spirits or else the music of the spirits would be given to Prince. Jackson said “I wake up from dreams and go ‘Wow, everything is right there in front of your face. I feel that somewhere, someplace it’s been done and I’m just a courier bringing it into the world” (MICHAEL JACKSON, Rolling Stone, Feb. 17, 1983). 
GINGER BAKER, something else is playing it and that same thing is playing all three of our instruments. That’s what I mean when I say it’s frightening sometimes. Maybe we’ll all play the same phrase out of nowhere. It happens very often with us” (Bob Larson, Rock and the Church, p. 66).

The original recording of “I Put a Spell on You” was done after the SCREAMIN’ JAY HAWKINS and his band members got drunk and “some type of presence seemed to seize him.” He began “grunting, gurgling in strange unknown tongues, and wildly dancing around the studio” (Heartbeat of the Dragon, p. 40).

Prince admitted he had 2 other people living inside him [really evil spirits] and that he changed his name to Formerly Known as Prince because he didn't know what the spirits wanted to call him 0A419B3E0058F3B8&amp;index=27&amp;playnext=3 @2:54

Eazy E revealed his Satanism and how Satan helped moved him along in his career 
The Bible is clear that Satan has control of the world until Christ returns. Satan even offered Jesus the kingdoms of the world if Jesus worshiped him so surely he can offer people fame and fortune if you served him. Satan is using music to pull people away from God.

Satan certainly has musical abilities. It is believed he was a minister of music in heaven before he got kicked out because iniquity was found in him. In Ezekiel 28:13 - ""Thou hast been in Eden the garden of God; every precious stone was thy covering, and the diamond, the beryl, the onyx, and the jasper, the sapphire, the emerald, and gold: THE WORKMANSHIP OF THY TIMBRELS AND OF THY PIPES WAS PREPARED IN THE DAY THAT THOU WAST CREATED.""

Isaiah14:11-12 ""Thy pomp is brought down to the grave, O Lucifer, son of the morning! how art thou cut down to the ground, which didst weaken the nations!

We only have to look around us at the music industry and its ""Rock

Spiritual warfare is certainly going on: ""For we do not wrestle against flesh and blood, against the rulers of the darkness of this age, against spiritual hosts of wickedness in the heavenly places."" -- Ephesians 6:12

There is a battle going on for your soul. The choice is either Jesus Christ or Satan.

God established the government that crucified Jesus. And the God-established government did not understand God's wisdom....

**""7 No, for if they had, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory."" (1 Corinthians 2)**

What is the significance of having a government established by God if said government does not even understand what God wants the government to do?

**""2 Consequently, but for those who do wrong."" (Romans 13)**

Jesus' experience in the Garden of Gethsemane suggests that he felt terror and apprehension at the thought of receiving the ultimate punishment from the God-instituted government. But Paul says that ""rulers hold no terror for those who do right

**""Do you want to be free from fear of the one in authority? Then do what is right and you will be commended."" (Romans 13)** 

Odd. Jesus supposedly did nothing *but* right. Yet he was *not* commended by the God-instituted government and he was *not* free from fear of being crucified by the one in authority. Was Paul not aware of the gospel story of a man named Jesus of Nazareth who was crucified by the Roman government during the reign of Tiberius?

**""4 For the one in authority is God’s servant for your good."" (Romans 13)** 

God's servant crucified Jesus for his own good.

**""But if you do wrong

Ah. Apparently

**""They are God’s servants

Ah. Apparently Jesus was a wrongdoer.

Romans 13 kinda makes me wonder if Paul was not preaching a different gospel from the one preached by the apostles

Maybe Paul was talking about those ""certain men who came from James"" (Galatians 2:11) when he said the following...?

**6 I am astonished that you are so quickly deserting the one who called you to live in the grace of Christ and are turning to a different gospel— 7 which is really no gospel at all. Evidently some people are throwing you into confusion and are trying to pervert the gospel of Christ. 8 But even if *we or an angel from heaven* should preach a gospel other than the one we preached to you

Strange that Paul would invoke the authority of an ""angel from heaven"" when speaking of heretics. Maybe what he meant was....

""Even if *Jesus Christ's hand-picked Apostles* should preach a gospel other than the one we preached to you

** 9 As we have already said

Would Paul say such nasty things about the representatives of the Jerusalem church?

He said worse.

**12 As for those agitators

Maybe those ""certain men from James"" were ""trying to pervert the gospel of Christ"" by saying that Christ was a recently deceased carpenter from Galilee?

Here is the question:

What would happen if Jesus jumped off the temple?  Would God keep his promise to keep Jesus safe?  Or would God break his promise to protect Jesus because Jesus actually had enough faith to believe the promise?

Now for your life.  If the Bible makes a claim such as:

1. ""pray and you will be healed""

2. ""accept Jesus and you'll go to Heaven""

3. ""God is present when two or three come together""

4. ""come unto me and I will give you rest.""

According to Acts 12, to be martyred while in the very next passage He saves Peter from the same fate by having Peter's chains fall off and the prison doors swing open. The motif of chains falling off and prison doors swinging open, BTW, is plagiarized from an ancient Greek play, The Bacchae. 

In the next passage of Acts 12 Jesus kills the king who had James put to death. Wouldn't it have been more kind to save James? Apparently

Other than that one passage in Acts, Jesus would return to earth to destroy all of his enemies and take over the world.

But on to the main subject of this post. Assuming any of the disciples *did* die violent deaths

We know that the Pharisees were jealous of the Apostles for their popularity and/or performance of miracles. We know that the Jews opposed the Christians for their attempts to persuade people to abandon the Mosaic law. And we know that the Roman civil authorities opposed Christians for their refusal to participate in offerings to the gods of Rome. Early Christians could have been killed for reasons other than belief in a resurrection. And just what did these earliest Christians believe about the resurrection?

I know that the Christian faith views homosexuals as sinners and holds that their relationships are detestable and evil. This is borne out (based on my limited understanding of the Bible) by the passages Leviticus 18:22 which states

&gt;*Do not have sexual relations with a man as one does with a woman; that is detestable.*

and by Leviticus 20:13 which states

&gt;*If a man has sexual relations with a man as one does with a woman

I've also noticed that Christians tend to revile abortion under any and all circumstances. This is borne out by the verses Jeremiah 1:4-5 which states

&gt;*Then the word of the LORD came to me

and verse Luke 1:15

&gt;*...and he will be filled with the Holy Spirit even before he is born.*

My question stems from the fact I've noticed that

The rule which says all houses must have a parapet around the roof (Deuteronomy 22:8).

&gt;*When you build a new house

The passage forbidding the eating of rare (bloody) meat (Leviticus 7:26-27)

&gt;*And wherever you live

The passage which forbids haircuts and shaving (Leviticus 19:27)
&gt;*Do not cut the hair at the sides of your head or clip off the edges of your beard.*

The passages which forbid the eating of certain meats (Leviticus 11:6-12)

&gt;*The rabbit, though it has a divided hoof, does not chew the cud; it is unclean for you. You must not eat their meat or touch their carcasses; they are unclean for you. Of all the creatures living in the water of the seas and the streams you may eat any that have fins and scales. But all creatures in the seas or streams that do not have fins and scales—whether among all the swarming things or among all the other living creatures in the water—you are to regard as unclean. And since you are to regard them as unclean, you must not eat their meat; you must regard their carcasses as unclean. Anything living in the water that does not have fins and scales is to be regarded as unclean by you.*

**Definitions:**

* 
A thing is said to be *objective* if its truth value is independent of any consciousness. Sound logical arguments provide us with an example: if A implies B, a thing is said to be *subjective* if its truth value is dependent on some consciousness. Emotions are subjective things: happiness cannot exist apart from consciousness, and thus is only able to exist subjectively.

* 
An action is said to be *moral* if it is imperative: we ought to perform moral actions.  Similarly, then conscious beings would have a moral obligation to be altruistic.  To fail to do so would be *immoral*.

* 
*God* is Yahweh, omniscient, omnibenevolent ~~lovable rascal~~ divine entity of Christianity.

With these definitions in mind

If God commands actions because they are moral, God cannot be immoral, and cannot command immoral actions.  However, God is omnipotent; thus God is able to command any action, including immoral actions.  But this is paradoxical.  Because the existence of a moral system apart from God would directly contradict his fundamental nature, we can eliminate the possibility of such a system entirely.

From this, all moral actions are subjective since their truth is dependent on God’s consciousness.  Therefore, an objective moral system does not exist.

1374435675.0,1irk9t,The Burden of Proof: A Checklist for both 'sides',SexWithTwins,30,13,277,"There was a post recently about how frustrating it can be when the same subjects go around and come around on /r/DebateAChristian

The argument was well made on both 'sides'

In another thread the Mods asked for feedback on what to do to correct some of these problems

**Why Christians carry the burden of proof**

Statement A contains the following:  God is a non-physical entity outside of space-time

Statement B contains the following:  God manifested Himself in human form on the planet earth 2013 years ago

Statement C, so that every living creature in the universe would know that He exists.

**Why the bible doesn't count**

I) It does not meet the burden of proof set out in statement C because the bible is not objectively valid.  II) It makes truth-claims which are directly contradicted by empirical observations.  III) It makes unfalsifiable truth-claims about observations which have not and / or cannot be made.

**Why atheists do not need to meet the burden of proof on your behalf**

I) Atheists do not believe God is a non-physical entity outside of space-time

**We'll move on when the criteria of statement C has been set out; possible objections**

Until C is presented in a way which is logically valid we cannot go forward.  There are no hypotheticals worth entertaining if they demand that Christians be allowed to sidestep them simply to:

I) Insist that statement C is only relevant if you lack faith in that particular religion.  If this is your get-out-of-jail-free card of choice, C.

II) Insist that atheists do in fact believe God is a non-physical entity outside of space-time, or have succumb in some other way to secondary truth-claims incumbent upon statement B.

III) Insist that the burden of proof does not rest upon such strict absolutes.  If you cannot see the logical necessity of C

[Special Pleading](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_pleading), NOT an artificially imposed barrier to statement C being shown objectively valid by a third-party.

**Summery**

This argument is not designed to scupper religious objections no-matter-what.  It is, morality, the origins of life, or the big bang can even begin.

Until it is acknowledged by those who insist otherwise

My problem with this bit of (il)logic is that it is no different from the statement ""John was immortal

Adam was NOT made perfect

Christians claim that we have an inherently sinful nature (original sin). This means that it is a part of our being that we do not control. Christians also believe that God made humans

So God created us with an inherently sinful nature, so he get's mad at us and drowns us all.

Then

Then

...make sense yet?

Christians will then try to play the free will card

God gave us the ability to sin and the ""free will"" to choose to sin... then he commanded us not to sin

Evidence:

First

&gt;If a prophet or a dreamer of dreams arises in your midst, **he spoke unto you saying ""Let us go after other gods, which you have not known, and serve them,"" you shall not heed the words of that prophet or dreamer of dreams,** for the Lord your God is testing you to know whether you love the Lord your God with all your heart and all your soul! It is after the Lord your God that you shall walk! And it is Him you shall fear! You shall observe His commandments! And hearken to His voice! And Him shall you serve! And unto Him shall you cleave!

&gt;**And that prophet or dreamer of dreams shall be put to death!** For he has spoken perversion against the Lord your God - Who has taken you out of Egypt

So the following conditions must be met for the execution of the dreamer of dreams or the prophet:

1. Must perform a sign or a wonder

2. Must incite people to worship any god other than the Lord himself

Jesus performed miracles and claimed to be divine according to the NT.

This made him a prophet/dreamer who performed miracles and told people to go after ""other gods who they have not known

Basically

Basically it's the ""Don't test God"" situation. Claiming to have faith

So you can say that you believe God will take care of you, and then, well the examples I had were these. 

No amount of faith, won't help you if you're cut and bleeding out, won't help you if you're smashed in a hydraulic press... 

It would be beyond easy for God to help someone in these situations. But deep down you know he wouldn't. You could never have enough faith to lock yourself in a tank of water for an hour. You know you would drown no matter what your beliefs are. If someone tied you to a chair and cut your arms, but that isn't supernatural, and can't be attributed to any divine source.)

So yeah. It's just us

The power of God is limited to things that could happen naturally

Ok that's the pitch. You know that faith can't help you in a great number of situations. You also know that there are times when things don't go well

Like if you were tied to a chair and someone saved you you would say that that was God, that's supernatural. If you were pressed under a hydraulic press and you suddenly had diamond hard skin and could withstand the pressure, then that would be supernatural. 

You could actually have faith

To put it simply

If you tell someone that you're doing an experiment and you're testing whether they're going to follow the rules

Now if you plan for the bias to test something else, but that's a different test. 

So here is my scenario. Well a few potential ones. 

1. There is no god and it's all just made up. 

What? Oh I have to put another? Ok well...

2. (Again) There is a god and he's doing some sort of double blind test. He wants to see how people act. (He can't care about innate good and evil. If he did he would have just made people

Ok sorry for the weird formatting I'm mostly asleep just running on fumes. 

Ok so

Basically God makes people and this time he doesn't fuck things up and have to kill everyone. He makes people and does everything correctly. 

He sets everything up

This is a world where there would be no hint of a god. He never talked to anyone, doesn't heal the sick, or anything. He just watches, and observes. He watches people either act horribly, or kindly, and sees most as somewhere in the middle. He doesn't need people to sit around praising him because the test should be whether or not people are generally good or generally bad. 

The whole idea that god needs people to praise and worship him is insane. There's no reason for him to even tell us that he exists. And judging us based on whether or not we believe he exists, is just about the stupidest thing I've ever heard of. 

So basically all that was the lead up

Why the heck did God tell people he existed and taint the experiment? 

What do you think about the possibility that things aren't as simple as they seem? What if he wants to see if people are smart enough to realize that there isn't actually enough evidence to believe in him. Or some other thing.

So I totally get that homosexuality is widely seen as a sin among most christians/christian communities today. I'm not interested in the whole ""well if being gay is forbidden then football

What I *am* curious about is why it seems like it is so important to make it illegal. There are a ton of legal [**benefits**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rights_and_responsibilities_of_marriages_in_the_United_States) for being legally married, is very detrimental.

Now I understand this reasoning may sound odd, would not want two men or two women to be recognized as legally equal to a heterosexual couple. My father, a devout christian but not a fundamentalist at all, told me that he feels that such recognition would undermine what he and my mother have.

My response to that view is this: how do these feelings justify making such a union illegal? These sentiments are all derived directly from the bible, legislate based on religion. The church has every right to not actually *marry* the couple, but denying them legal protection in my mind isn't much different from officially denying muslims legal protection (just as an example). [In this speech made by Obama a few years ago](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Av3H0_7HgSg), he really puts it better than I ever could. He makes some really powerful points here, points that, even from a religious standpoint (and growing up in a very christian home I think I can emulate one) I can't see how you can argue with what he says here. 

There are many defenses of anti-homosexuality I've seen that base themselves on things other than religion. Before I even get into some examples

In my father's case, and was infected with HIV, because of a homosexual affair. He firmly believes that the way ""homosexual intercourse"" works makes it far better at transmitting disease. The research that I've done into the subject it largely conflicting, and it is very difficult to find truly impartial data on the matter. From what I can tell, it is the promiscuity, and not the action itself, that leads to infection (if there *are* some good impartial studies out there I'd love to hear about them). And from that, I would argue that A) that is not the *entire* community

I would think that if you believe homosexual intercourse transmits disease more effectively, they will be less likely to remain in a committed relationship, thus resulting in them copulating with more people. If neither spouse has an STI, then it is impossible for one of them to get one inside of that relationship. Even if one of them*is* infected, then marriage increases the likelihood that it won't spread beyond those two people. So, ultimately, short of making gay sex illegal entirely (which is ludicrous)

Another thing I've heard is how gay couples are bad parents, just as much as mommy and daddy love each other.""

Finally there is the ""it is unnatural, why allow heterosexual parents to choose whether or not to have children? I can't think of a reason. Second, contrary to popular belief, [Animals do it too.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homosexual_behavior_in_animals). In fact, most studies show that the number of homosexual sexual encounters in giraffes *far* outstrips the number of heterosexual ones. Finally, how exactly do you *define* ""natural?"" you could easily describe medicating oneself against illness, or better yet treating mental disorders

Anyway, or was just wrong? Are there any major viewpoints I missed? What do all of you think? I know this is a really lengthy post, but I just wanted to be sure I covered everything I can think of.

1321577645.0,mgcmo,"Judas didn't betray Jesus. As a narrative function, Judas betrays Christianity, revealing it for what it is.",Basilides,29,77, ""why did the Sanhedrin need Judas?"" The answer is quite simple: the Sanhedrin did not need Judas.

Jesus could have been arrested any number of times without the general populace knowing about it. It would have been simple to keep tabs on his whereabouts. The religious authorities did not need a betrayal - only the gospel writers needed a betrayal

In the earliest Christian writings, Paul also never mentions the Sanhedrin, Herod Antipas, Pontius Pilate or a whole host of characters and episodes from the Jesus biography. In fact, the only episodes Paul mentions are Jesus' birth (""born of woman"" but no Mary and no virgin), the Last Supper, the crucifixion and the resurrection. But I digress.

""For I received from the Lord what I also passed on to you: The Lord Jesus,"" (1 Corinthians 11:23)

The Greek word translated above as ""betrayed"" is [""paradidomi"" or ""paradidomai""](http://www.studylight.org/lex/grk/view.cgi?number=3860). But in Romans 8:32 and Romans 4:25 the word is translated as ""handed over"" or ""delivered over"". 

Gospel writers constructed episodes of the Jesus story using passages from the Tanakh. Perhaps this is how ""hand over"" turned into ""betrayed"" and an anonymous act or an act of God (handing over) came to be applied to a specific human character (Judas).

Specifically

""Even my bosom friend in whom I trusted

The author of Matthew fleshes out the Judas character with even more Old Testament passages.

""It is interesting to see how Matthew embellishes the enigmatic figure and fate of Judas. First, throwing it into the Temple treasury, and that the priests decided to use it to buy the potter’s field? The Syriac version of Zechariah reads: “Then the LORD said to me, ‘Cast it into the treasury, this lordly price at which I was paid off by them. So I took the thirty shekels of silver and cast them into the treasury in the house of the LORD.” The Hebrew of the same verse reads: “”Cast it to the potter, etc.” How does Matthew know Judas hanged himself? That was the fate of David’s traitorous counselor Ahithophel (2 Samuel 17:23), whom scribal tradition took to be the subject of Psalm 41:9, p. 106)."" 

[Robert M. Price

The ""betrayal"" related by the gospels and pretty much every element of the Judas tale is based on Old Testament scripture or ""messianic prophecy."" The Judas episode is pure fiction.

But why is this fictional character named Judas?

The English word ""Jew"" is derived from the Latin Iudaeus, could also mean ""Judaean"". The character is named ""Judas"" simply to indicate that he is a Jew from Judea.

""Spong's conclusion is that early Bible authors, personified in Judas as the Jewish state, who either betrayed or handed-over Jesus to his Roman crucifiers. Spong identifies this augmentation with the origin of modern Anti-Semitism.""

My parents are devout evangelical Christians. They believe that the Bible is God's word

I had a short conversation the other night with my mother about homosexuals and how I didn't agree with her stance on their ""sinful"" nature. She brought up points about how it states specifically in the bible that homosexuality is a sin. I know for a fact that she believes these people are going to hell if they don't somehow ""change"" and accept Jesus Christ.

If this isn't judgement of another human being, then why did he give us the tools to judge? Why would he tell us what can put a person in hell (homosexuality, revilery, theivery, etc) and then, in multiple separate verses, tell us not to judge?

You must be a creationist, as you will probably need to reference it to rebut some of my arguments. I want the infallibility and literalism of scripture to be taken as a given. This is my theology as well, even if I don't believe in it.

I will *not* be attacking your views on origins, mostly from a Jewish perspective.

So to sum up the givens that will be accepted before the debate even starts as fact and framework:

* God exists. He is a ~~non-corporeal~~, all-loving being that intervenes (whether naturally or supernaturally) on this earth and has a master plan for humanity, which He cares about dearly. Arguments against God like the problem of evil will not be mentioned or used because theistic belief is background for this debate. (Arguments that can be used against a specific religion's understanding of its deity are just fine though.)
* The book which you call the Old Testament and that I call the Torah is the infallible, even if not dictated directly like the Pentateuch was.
* God created the world in six days
* Judaism was the correct religion at one point in time.
* All the prophecies of the OT are binding
* Jesus existed.
* Islam and all the non-Abrahamic religions are undoubtedly false.

What will be disputed: The divinity of Jesus, and which religion is right.

Of course this Christian scholar goes on to say

More specifically

A son fathered of a god and a mortal woman (Prometheus, Adonis aka Tammuz) born of a virgin (Perseus) who performed healings (Asclepius), fantastic feats (Hercules), was scoffed at yet pursued what is right and honorable despite knowing that it would result in his own early death (Achilles), made a great sacrifice for the benefit of mankind (Prometheus), descended into Hell to rescue lost souls (Hercules) and ascended into Heaven (Hercules).

And the great Hellenistic thinker, and even eventually seek to kill him if they ever have the chance.

Remember

Other borrowings from Hellenism:

The Trinity, the Platonic mind-body dualism of Paul, the Logos, the red dragon chasing the woman with child in the Book of Revelation, the millenium and the lake of fire.

The list goes on and on.

Even the idea of overturning an old religion by re-imagining an old myth comes from Hellenism...

There were two Prometheus myths. Hesiod wrote an early version of the myth (which we might refer to as the ""Old Testament"" myth of Prometheus) wherein Zeus was the good guy and Prometheus was the bad guy. But in the 5th century BC, composed Prometheus Bound, the Greek antecedent to the Pauline idea that mankind had been cursed by the father of the god. In Aeschylus' telling of the story, Hesiod's earlier version was inverted. Similarly, Christianity is an inversion of the original Yahweh myth.

""These innovations reflect the play's thematic reversal of the Hesiodic myth. In Hesiod, of Pandora) serves to reinforce the theodicy of Zeus: he is a *wise and just* ruler of the universe, while Prometheus *is to blame for humanity's unenviable existence*. In Prometheus Bound, this dynamic is transposed: Prometheus *becomes the benefactor of humanity*, while every character in the drama (except for Hermes, a virtual stand-in for Zeus) decries the Olympian as a cruel, vicious tyrant.""

1332347684.0,r6x8h,"""Forgive those who trespass against us.""",Basilides,27,9,24,"According to the author of the Lord's Prayer

That's a little ironic. 

The Christian god blew his first opportunity to forgive others and instead invented the *grudge* against others as a shining example of how *not* to be.

When Adam and Eve committed the absolutely horrible crime of failing to heed the advice of the Christian god, despite the Son coming to earth and sacrificing himself in the futile attempt to undo the damage done by the Father, to this very day the Father continues to retaliate against the entire human race. I can only conclude that Jesus' father has a huge ego.

Jesus directed The Lord's Prayer to his egotistical Father. But how can we reasonably expect the god of the grudge to forgive those who trespass against us? He would not forgive the first trespass and for 4

If Jesus was God

Are we ready to forgive the Christian god for his refusal to forgive Adam and Eve? Are we ready to forgive the Christian god for retaliating against billions of people who did not eat the fruit in the Garden? Are we ready to forgive the Christian god for the following trespasses against us?

1) Inadequately preparing Adam and Eve for the temptation of the serpent

2) Withholding from Adam and Eve some of the consequences of eating the fruit

3) Allowing the evil serpent into his perfect paradise

4) Punishing two people who could not know they were committing a sin.

5) Cursing all women with pain in childbirth and second class citizenship because a metaphorical woman listened to a metaphorical serpent and ate a metaphorical fruit

6) Cursing all people who would ever be born with death because of a single metaphorical act committed by two metaphorical people. Under this curse

7) Cursing all people who would ever be born with a sinful nature because of a single metaphorical act committed by two metaphorical people. The Christian god causes you to have sinful thoughts and then blames you for the thoughts he causes (Romans 7:8 and 14-24). The Christian god calls this justice.

8) Drowning every infant and child on earth.

9) Destroying the unified language of the human race to cause discord among us.

10) Lying to Abraham by going back on His word to give the promised land to Abraham's descendants (Genesis 15:17-20). Christians say that the Christian god demanded a perfect sacrifice to satisfy his sense of justice, changes his mind and changes the rules at will. Why, therefore, should we believe the crucifixion was necessary? Why should we believe the Christian god's entire 6,000 year process (game) of justice is necessary?

11) Ordering the Children of Israel to commit genocide.

12) Condoning slavery and rape.

13) Punishing the Jews in general for the actions of the few Jews who participated in the execution of Jesus many years earlier. Under Christianity

Maybe the Christian god knew *not* what he did...until 1 AD when He gave birth to a new idea? The idea of forgiveness symbolized by Jesus. But

There's a war in heaven all right. It's a war between the primitive Christian god of wrath and the new improved Christian god of love. It's a war between the divided loyalties of God. Selfishness vs. Unselfishness. The same inner struggle we all experience every day.

**TL;DR** The Kingdom is within. The Father is within and the Son is within. The metaphorical sins of God the Father represent my sins. When I can forgive and accept myself

Hopefully, may we and God someday have one perspective and not two. On that day will not see God as a god of wrath *and* a god of love because we will not see ourselves as divided against others. And God will not see himself as divided against us. Hopefully, someday the body of the Christian god will not be full of darkness.

There is no reason to be human. There is no restraint from the depths of evil which is man. The Communist tortures often said, “Thank God

Richard Wurmbrand

One often hears such examples brought up by Christians. If there is no God

The Christian I think has a point, to do evil acts as they no longer fear punishment for their actions. However, is it also not true that theism can have a similarly demoralizing effect? Consider the massacre of Beziers in 1209 C.E. Catholic crusaders slaughtered every single inhabitant of the city during the Albigensian Crusade which was launched by pope Innocent in 1208. This crusade was directed at the Cathars of Southern France. Yet, the crusaders viciously and deliberately put the entire city to the sword. Man, women, or child. Catholic or Cathar. It made no difference to the invading army. A passage from the historian Joseph Sumption gives the chilling reasons for the indiscriminate behavior of the attackers.

“A German monk repeated a story that Arnald-Amaury

We have seen a case where atheism inspired horrendous behavior; here theism- specifically the divine guarantee of justice- has done the same. This massacre was justified by the belief (a correct one

Atheists have no such recourse. The universe is only as good as we make it. There is no God, rather than being demoralizing, should be remoralizing. There is a greater sense of urgency to obtain justice in this life if it is the only one. It should make us uncomfortable with the taking of human life for any reason. On the other hand, a divine guarantee of justice can make us careless. It can make us more willing to use capital punishment, to send soldiers off to war, and, in cases such as the Crusades, perhaps he would not have had the confidence to assert that God had told him to invade Iraq. Perhaps Atheism can lead to horrendous actions

Next, no matter what you do to another person, you cannot, in any way, have an effect on their ultimate fate. Even the brutal murder of someone cannot impose an underserved fate onto someone else; all the killer has done is to deliver them into the hands of a perfect judge. If we consider self sacrifice, we rightly admire those who give their lives up for another or for a noble cause. But on theism, what have they really sacrificed? A martyr made the huge sacrifice of a few years on earth for an eternity of bliss. Consider a mother who throws herself in front of gunfire to save her child. On theism, and she has not really saved her child from a fate worse than the one he deserved. For if theism is true, knowing it to be the end. A person who accepts a fate worse than they deserve for the sake of another is the epitome of self sacrifice.

I end with a quote from the great Bertrand Russell, you would not argue, ""The underneath ones must be good, so as to redress the balance."" You would say, ""Probably the whole lot is a bad consignment""; and that is really what a scientific person would argue about the universe” We will not produce good fruit by hoping the bottom of the crate is good.

1368111535.0,1e05dh,Why I don't like it when the origin of morality is credited to anywhere else but humans,travis_s,19,6,73,"**TL;DR acknowledgment**: The overall point I make below is that denying ourselves the creation of our own morality is extremely self-deprecating. It robs us of the one thing that makes us truly human. 

An opening question that I get when I tell anybody that I'm a non-believer is usually something along the lines of: ""Well, right?

I guess for starters I can acknowledge the fact that this is a losing debate because if you are a Christian then of course your answer to this is that God is the source of our morality (God created everything, I just want to offer up yet another non-believer's view on the subject.

As an atheist, that's what makes us human, right? And to a Christian you feel the same way: yes our morality is what makes us human, for it is the gift endowed upon us by our creator. That's fine, but as a non-believer it frustrates me to no-end to hear that we can't acknowledge.

I'm not going to sit here and say that morality is a delusion; that it is subjective. But it is *evolving*. It is something we've been trying to reach a consensus on since the dawn of society. Can we all acknowledge the fact that slavery is a universal crime against humanity? We do now

A lot of Christians assume that if morality didn't come from God then it wouldn't exist at all; that there would be nothing stopping us from wreaking absolute havoc on ourselves with no consequence. Again, but it doesn't have to. When I do good things, it makes me feel good. It's as simple as that. And sure, doing bad things can also make me feel good, but doing bad things will eventually have negative consequences. We do good things because good things often happen to us in return (by and large). We do good things because it helps us survive as a species. 

That's my rant for the morning. It is probably a largely incoherent group of ramblings that may or may not form a succinct message

There are several problems with this

What is nothing? It is nothing... simple but profound if you understand what I am getting at with that statement. Nothing cannot exist, we have never found a volume which contained literally nothing. ""Empty"" space is not empty, it is very much full. We see it as empty because our five senses do not detect anything, but ""something"" is there, not ""nothing"". Electromagnetic fields, specifically. The space between the sun and the Earth may appear empty but it is completely flooded, inundated, that is why we can see the sun, etc etc... all forms of EM radiation of specific wavelength regions, there is still something. If you could remove all energy and matter from the entire universe and place yourself in the middle of this ""empty"" volume you would still be able to tell if you were spinning or not... your arms would still be pulled away from your sides if you were spinning... there has to be a reference frame

Furthermore, only of it's conservation.

The point I am making is that we have no evidence

Existence is the default state, because we have no evidence that the opposite is even possible. Nothingness would require an explanation, not somethingness.

* According to the Bible the earth was created out of water (not molten rock)
* According to the Bible death is an intruder on the created order (not the mechanism by which God uses to create; if this were to be so that would make God the creator of all death and suffering)

&gt;Matthew 19:16-21

&gt;English Standard Version (ESV)
&gt;The Rich Young Man

&gt;16  And behold, “Teacher, what good deed must I do to have eternal life?” 17 And he said to him, “Why do you ask me about what is good? There is only one who is good. **If you would enter life, keep the commandments.”** 18 He said to him, “Which ones?” And Jesus said, “You shall not murder, You shall not steal, You shall love your neighbor as yourself.” 20 The young man said to him, sell what you possess and give to the poor

With Romans 10:8-10;

&gt;Romans 10:8-10

&gt;English Standard Version (ESV)

&gt;8 But what does it say? “The word is near you, if you confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved. 10 For with the heart one believes and is justified, and with the mouth one confesses and is saved.

Why does Paul teach a different requirement for salvation that Jesus?  When I first became a Christian, even as a Christian, when I read the Gospels (with the obvious exception of John), I noticed that Jesus heavily preached the Law.  Jesus even said that he did not come to abolish the Law, but to fulfil it (Matthew 5:17).

Whenever I ask Christians I know about the blatant discrepancy between what Paul taught on salvation and what Jesus himself was alleged to have said, why did he bother preaching it?  Why didn't Jesus directly say to the rich young ruler that he (the rich man) only needed to believe in Jesus in order to be saved?  

Another excuse I've heard from my Christian family members is that the disciples couldn't bear the knowledge that the Law was going to be abolished.  This is probably taken from John 16:12-13;

&gt;John 16:12-13

&gt;English Standard Version (ESV)

&gt;12 “I still have many things to say to you, for he will not speak on his own authority, but whatever he hears he will speak, and he will declare to you the things that are to come.

But if Jesus meant by this that they couldn't bear the knowledge that the Law was going to be abolished

Furthermore

&gt;Galatians 2:16

&gt;English Standard Version (ESV)

&gt;16 yet we know that a person is not justified by works of the law but through faith in Jesus Christ, because by works of the law no one will be justified.

So either Jesus is right and Paul is wrong

Also, was written sometime between 65CE and 70CE.  So basically, Paul didn't have access to the Gospels that we read now.  He had never read them.  Given that Paul's ""Gospel"" is actually different from what Jesus taught in the Gospels, it is highly likely that if Paul had known of them he would have written against them.

1. If the biblical portrayals of slavery are accurate
2. A morally perfect being would never endorse an immoral act/practice.

These two guarantee that at least one of the following statements is true:

* The bible's portrayals of slavery^1 are inaccurate.
* God is not morally perfect.
* Slavery^2 is not immoral.

^1 There are two distinct treatments given to slavery in the OT. One describes proper treatment and rights held by Hebrew 'slaves' owned by Hebrews. This version is something like indentured servitude, but the text is clear in that gentile slaves are actual slaves, and are actually subjected to pretty harsh conditions.

^2 Note I am using the term ""slavery"" to denote ""the form of slavery portrayed in the bible.""

I hope to see some significant discussion on the subject, or the immorality of slavery.

1331868779.0,qyvqr,Why isn't abortion discussed in the Bible?,richunclesam,17,2,138,"As stated.  

I recently learned that abortion is *not* a novel idea or practice.  It predates Christianity in several cultures.  It would have been a known ""issue"" to both Luke (who, as a cosmopolitan Roman, would have seen the practice or at least heard of it).  

The Torah seems to deal with just about every aspect of life.  It specifies how fabrics should be woven and what ingredients should not be eaten together.  So it seems conspicuous that abortion does not merit a specific mention.  There is one reference in Exodus 21:22, to ""fetal murder.""  There are a few passages that ascribe different ""value"" to lives depending on age, and there is a passage (2 Kings 2:21) that refers to miscarriage as a bad thing.  But there is nothing in either old or new that explicitly say, ""abortion is wrong.""

What gets me so hung-up about this is the fact that the political church treats abortion as a *core issue*.  As I see it, judgment, hypocrisy, and greed.  Instead, the Church is entirely hung up on issues that require reading between the lines to ""discern"" the supposed Biblical position.

Abortion isn't the only issue that's a stretch, yet in the old testament context, it is treated as a property issue, and in the new testament it is unaddressed.  Homosexuality is another one; while both old and new contain passages condemning it, there are plenty of cues that cultural relativity and context should be applied.  I don't even remember off the top of my head what issues the Church seems to care about anymore.  I got so fed up with it.

I'd been going to a Mennonite church for a few years where none of these made-up issues were allowed into the forefront, and peacemaking.  But geography and demographics are making it harder for me to keep up with that fellowship, and I just can't seem to find another one where I don't get absolutely infuriated whenever I walk in.

All of these (besides the instance with the cancerous cells) are people whom I personally know and trust. I could go on for a while. I have also seen people pray for strangers on the street/in public and had them experience healing (much to their shock and disbelief).

Would you rationalize it away? Would it convince you of Christianity (even if you still couldn't explain it logically or philosophically)? Would you be frightened or incredulous and ignore it? 

If any of you *have* experienced anything like this, I was definitely a cessationist. Once I saw God manifest himself through healing, though, especially in the context of people I know and trust, I had to radically re-think my theology.

All of the examples I gave are really not glamorous at all. Usually they happened in a small room in my school, office, or a friend's house, and often they were instances of friends praying for other friends (specifically friends who have been educated in the spiritual gifts and who actively believe in modern day physical healing through prayer) and pastors or Christian ""celebrities"" weren't involved at all. **I'm more interested in whether people's beliefs that are grounded in their rationalization and what they've been taught are/can be influenced by what they see, or hear testimonies of.**",t5_2ryd5,True

First of all, ""swindlers...that is what some of you *were*"". How is it that between verses 8 and 11 *current* swindlers became *former* swindlers? Paul seems to be encouraging his followers to engage in magical thinking. Just remember that you are Christian and you are no longer a swindler.

But the real incoherence comes in verse 9.

""Or do you not know that wrongdoers will not inherit the kingdom of God?'

Say what? Throughout his writings

If Paul really taught that the Mosaic law was abolished and/or that Christians are no longer subject to the penalty for breaking the Mosaic law

So with Paul we have:

1) Christian swindlers transforming into sanctified non-swindlers just by remembering that they are Christians. 

2) The penalty for breaking the law abolished...then re-established.

 23 The man said

   “This is now bone of my bones
   and flesh of my flesh;
she shall be called ‘woman

If, much more will those who receive the abundance of grace and the [real] free gift of righteousness [truly] reign in life through the one [real] Jesus Christ (Romans 5:17).

Such a blend of fact and fiction is a flimsy foundation on which to build a doctrine of eternal life. Observe how Paul weaves Adam’s sin and Christ’s righteous death together into the very fabric of salvation. Paul evidently regarded Adam and Christ as the two key characters in human history, then why should we believe Paul when he tells us that Christ rose miraculously from the dead? And “if Christ has not been raised, your faith is futile,” Paul warns us (I Corinthians 15:17)

The entire premise of Christianity is that God incarnated himself as Jesus Christ to be sacrificed as the only means of salvation for man.  According to the Bible and to the Christian god

If a non-Christian can enter it means you don't have to believe in Christianity at all.  A God who was allowing non-Christians into heaven would clearly not be related to Jesus Christ and would have to base his judgments on merit and good deeds.  This is not the case in Christianity, you must recognize him as your personal savior.

If you want to call yourself a Christian

I'm beyond frustrated with Christians trying to take the 'good' route when it comes to eternal judgment.  If you want to believe that God sees the inherent good in people and will judge accordingly then you don't agree with the Christian God and, loving, and selfless life.  If you believe others gain entrance to heaven, your God does not agree with you.

1374174555.0,1iktja,An Argument for Christianity,smokeymcdank,27,12,171,"I am writing this for a few reasons.  First, I have been somewhat disappointed in the rigor of these debates

I wrote this a while ago

My belief in a higher being follows roughly that which was offered in [The Evolution of God](http://www.amazon.com/The-Evolution-Back-Readers-Pick/dp/031606744X) by Robert Wright.  I am a big fan of his

I. Does this debate even make sense?

Faith is personal.  Debating it is a bit like debating musical taste.  It is subjective and based upon the interpretation of the individual experiencing it.  What you experience is not what another will.  Moreover, so let me address the reasons I do so.

A.  Christians can be dicks.

I get it.  I feel the same revulsion when a Christian group takes over a school board in Kansas and takes evolution out of the curriculum.  It makes my blood boil when Christians use the Bible as justification for their preconceived prejudice.  I also understand how it feels to be a minority voice in a sea of that type of shit

Please understand, I think only a very vocal minority of Christians are that way.  I think most go to Church most Sundays and “are not very political” like most other Americans.  Please do not conflate conservative political views with Christianity.  I will concede that there is a correlation, but I don’t think that there is necessary a causal relationship (more on this later).

B.  There is little logic in Religion.

I’m sorry but this is just the way it is.  I suspect that this is why people turn to religion when there is no logical explanation for the purpose of something.  This is the age-old question of why bad things happen to good people.  I understand that an atheist would state simply that there is *no purpose*, or been diagnosed with a terminal illness, or found out that your wife never loved you.  These are times when it is human to ask *why?*.

Either way this debate cannot take place in the form of mathematical proof.  Any Christian who says so is fooling himself

II.  Spirituality is Built In.

*Why?* is the quintessential human question.  Humans began answering this question with their imagination.  Bad things happened because of this god, gods for groups of people.
When humans discovered scientific explanations for the world around us

Today, also, contend that our understanding is implicitly limited by the Uncertainty Principle, in that we will never understand what the Universe was like *before we looked at it*.  In other words, science will always leave a little, even if very, very small part of nature unexplained.  This question of “why?” will never be fully satisfied by science.  Thus, I think there will always be room for religion.

A. 	So what if it’s built in?

One’s life is basically the interaction between many different interrelated, the mind, your social interactions, and spiritual questions.  Humans have developed different mechanism to ensure the health of these different spheres.  Concerning physical health, we exercise, go to the doctor, eat right, we educate ourselves

Religion is humanity’s attempt at giving structure and discipline to the inquiry into the unanswerable questions.  It is my contention that it is good for people to develop this part of themselves.  It gives meaning beyond game-theory to altruism, I feel it should be developed through discipline and practice in the same way we develop our bodies through exercise and our minds through education.

B.  What if I choose to develop spiritually differently than you?

Short answer: I don’t care.  Look, as aforementioned, most are not extreme and are just going about their daily lives with religion being only one sphere in a person made up of many.

I think that discipline and development of one’s spiritual side is important, I have tried out other religions (both Christian and non-Christian).  And this seems to be a good fit for me.  To continue an analogy, why would I care whether my friend likes to bike to stay in shape while I like to lift weights.  As long as he is exercising, I don’t care.

C.  What if I choose not to develop spiritually?

This question can be rephrased: What if spiritual development is not a priority for me?  Cool.  Prioritize the way you want.  There is an assumption out there among non-religious folks that religious folks will look down on them for not having their priorities straight.  This assumption is correct much of the time.  It is basically the same thing as a guy who works out looking down on a fat guy.  The workout guy just thinks the fat guy has his priorities wrong.  

This is not for me to judge.  I think that most religious people won’t judge atheists along these same lines.  I just want to point out that this is the source of the disparagement

III.  So Why Christianity and How do you Know that it’s the “Right One”?

As I mentioned, but I can’t presume to tell people how to do it.  Most religions will say that it is the only true religion.  Accordingly, a few Christians will tell me that this is not right.  But keeping in mind the similarity between religions, I think its rather presumptuous to tell people that one is right for them.

IV.   But your religion says X

Any Christian who is not aware that the Bible is not the word of God

A. Inconsistencies

For example

However, the same is not true of these “holy” documents.  They were written over centuries, and are not meant to prove anything, but rather to communicate spiritual ideas and ideals.  They are also subject to varying interpretations.  Whereas a scientific paper should not really be open to various interpretations, a spiritual document almost needs to be to survive changing times.

B.  Interpretation

Here I will simply cut-and-paste from a comment a wrote a while back.
  
&gt;The Bible is a lot like the U.S. Constitution. Both are sacred documents. Both were written long ago. Both are open to many different interpretations pursuant to many different ideologies.
Asking how one should read the Bible is just like asking how one should read the Constitution. I cannot say how people should read the Constitution. I can say how people do read it
So just because the Bible is and should be construed differently by different people does not take away from the value of the document itself.

V.	Conclusion

Well I hope I have covered my bases.  Hit me with questions and challenges and what not.  I will do my best to respond to respectful and helpful comments.

For example
  
Leviticus 25:44-46  
Exodus   21:2-6  
Exodus   21:7-11 (selling daughter as a sex slave)  
  
So does the new testament:  
  
Luke     12:47-48  
  
There are more
  
The biggest defense to this line of argument is that slavery in these times was completely different than, nowhere in the Bible does it say that you are not allowed to own another human being. 
  
And this to me is absolute proof that the Bible was written by people of the time as opposed to the word of God.  As someone who is secular it is very easy to explain why slavery is treated this way in the Bible and by Christ.  As opposed to most atheists I know, thus the Bible condones it.  We can say the same for Christ, and even if he had wanted to stand up against slavery in any form, I think he knew realistically no one would take him seriously as it was such a common practice in the day.  If Christ were truly the son of God, I think at some point in the new testament we would have seen him say something like ""Don't cheat, lie, murder, rape

Matthew says Jesus was born in Judea during the reign of Herod the Great and Luke says Jesus was born during the major tax census while Quirinius was governor of Syria. These are both documented historical events but they are also separated by at least 10 years making it historically impossible for Jesus to be born during both events.

---


Apologists have tried to cover up this historical contradiction by making up the claim that there was an earlier census AND that Quirinius was also governor of Syria twice. However Quirinius was never the governor of Syria prior to 6 CE and was the governor of Pamphylia-Galatia (in modern Turkey) during the last years of King Herod. Also there was not another large census within 100 years prior to 6 CE.

But this post is not about science vs. religion.  It's about the kind of thinking that leads to either - skepticism vs. faith.

The type of thinking that religion rises from is faith-based.  A believer hedges his whole interpretation of reality on two things:  1.  The assumption that a book is divinely inspired and the complete truth, and no way to verify.  

The type of thinking that sciences rises from is skepticism-based.  If an observation contradicts a scientist's understanding, and that he's prone to that imperfection.  But the base of knowledge continues to grow, and there is always progress in the uphill climb.  We've built some amazing things with this type of thinking discipline, and we've even put a man on the moon with it.  Without expecting it, we've achieved a beautiful convergence of our understanding of the universe from this kind of thinking, and within that framework there is no necessity of a god (or an Abrahamic religion-based god).

Does that mean that one third of God's brain was destroyed for 72 hours? How does one third of an infinite being die without being one third finite?

**2)** Animals sacrificed in the Old Testament never came back to life. They made a real sacrifice. The sacrifice of their lives. Permanently. Jesus' sacrifice as the passover lamb was only for 72 hours. How can that possibly be considered equivalent to the permanent and irrevocable sacrifice of a passover lamb?

**3)** God the Father hated all humans because the first human disobeyed him by eating an apple. God the father expressed this hatred by cursing all of us from birth with a sinful nature. Then he punishes each one of us with death because we fail to resist the sinful nature he cursed us with. So it is God's will that we sin and it is God's will that we do not sin. The deity is a psycho. He apparently experience some kind of psychotic break around the year 1

**4)** But this sacrifice business is just a hold over from the meaningless and barbaric sacrifice ritual that God the father introduced in the Old Testament: animal sacrifice. Genesis 8:21 says that God the father likes the smell of burning animal flesh. Apparently

**5)** Jesus was supposedly the one and only perfect sacrifice because he was sinless. Which is also stupid because goats and sheep are incapable of sin. *All* animal sacrifices were sinless sacrifices! Every goat and sheep was just as untainted by sin as Jesus. Apparently

**6)** In the Old Testament the animal sacrifice itself temporarily saved people from God's wrath *without the people of the community having to believe anything about the sacrifice*. Therefore

**7)** Jesus himself and several passages in the Old Testament say that God does not desire sacrifice. He desires that humans express mercy and a contrite heart. Well

**8)** Christians suffer from a mighty form of cognitive dissonance. They believe that Jesus conquered death *physically* so that they can conquer death *spiritually*. That is: Christians believe they are *spiritually* resurrected because Jesus was *physically* resurrected. If Christians were being logically consistent they would concede that Jesus was also spiritually and not physically resurrected. 

The Pope agrees.

I'm not an expert on this subject and haven't  studied all these positions in detail

&gt;Support and affirmation of marriage rights for same-sex couples increasingly come from those who practice progressive Christianity.

&gt;Several well established Christian denominations support the legality of same-sex marriage and perform same-sex weddings and blessings religiously. The three largest of these denominations in North America are **the Episcopal Church of the United States

&gt;While self-identified progressive faith organizations such as **the Religious Society of Friends (Quakers)**, the Church of the Brethren, the Old Catholic Church, the Church of Sweden and the Church of Scotland** also support marriage rights for gay and lesbian persons.

&gt;**Members of Reform Judaism** support the inclusion of same-sex unions within the definition of marriage. **The Jewish Reconstructionist Federation** leaves the choice to individual rabbis.

&gt;Some Conservative Jews reject recognition of same-sex unions as marriages

&gt;Due to the ambivalent language about homosexuality in Buddhist teachings

&gt;There is no objection of the Buddha found in the Tipitaka. Buddha was neither supportive nor against marriages between members of the same gender. [I should note that this is also true of  Jesus.]

(Matthew 5:18)


Many

But let's look at this *in context*.

Our first piece of context is Matthew 24 where Jesus talks about the ""all"" that needs to be ""accomplished"".

All of the following events are to happen

4 Jesus answered: “Watch out that no one deceives you. 5 For many will come in my name,’ and will deceive many. 6 You will hear of wars and rumors of wars, but see to it that you are not alarmed. **Such things must happen (i.e must be *accomplished*), but the end is still to come.** 7 Nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. There will be famines and earthquakes in various places. 8 **All these are the beginning of birth pains.**

Another component of the ""all"" that needs to be accomplished before Heaven and Earth can pass away and the Law can disappear/be abolished....

14 And this gospel of the kingdom will be preached in the whole world as a testimony to all nations

Then Jesus discusses Heaven and Earth passing away...

21 **For then there will be great distress

The worst thing ever. What could that possibly be? The destruction (disappearance/passing away) of the earth as we know it

29 “Immediately after the distress of those days

“‘the sun will be darkened
and the moon will not give its light;
**the stars will fall from the sky
and the heavenly bodies will be shaken.’**

30 “Then will appear the sign of the Son of Man in heaven. And then all the peoples of the earth will mourn when they see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of heaven, from one end of the heavens to the other.

32 “Now learn this lesson from the fig tree: As soon as its twigs get tender and its leaves come out, you know that it is near, right at the door**. 34 Truly I tell you, this generation will certainly not pass away until all these things have happened **(been accomplished?)**. 35 **Heaven and earth will pass away**, but my words will never pass away. 

Jesus states unequivocally

This *prophecy* is repeated *verbatim* in Mark and Luke.

Heaven and earth will pass away

Heaven and earth will pass away

When Jesus promised in all three synoptic gospels that ""heaven and earth will pass away"" he was not using a figure of speech or engaging in hyperbole. He was referring to a what he believed to be a literal event

37 As it was in the days of Noah, marrying and giving in marriage, up to the day Noah entered the ark; 39 and they knew nothing about what would happen until the flood came and took them all away. That is how it will be at the coming of the Son of Man.

2 Peter 3 also compares the literal disappearance of the Heavens and the Earth to the days of Noah...

""...long ago by God’s word the heavens came into being and the earth was formed out of water and by water. 6 By these waters also the world of that time was deluged and destroyed. 7 By the same word the present heavens and earth are reserved for fire

10 But the day of the Lord will come like a thief. The heavens will disappear with a roar; the elements will be destroyed by fire

Notice that both Jesus and the author of 2 Peter use the word ""disappear"" in relation to the fate of the heavens and the Earth. And Peter is *definitely* talking about a literal event.

1 And I saw a new heaven and a new earth: for the first heaven and the first earth were passed away; and there was no more sea. (Revelation 21)

Now let's take another look at the passage Christians do their best to ignore or explain away as meaningless hyperbole.

18 For truly I tell you, not the least stroke of a pen, will by any means disappear from the Law until everything is accomplished. (Matthew 5:18)

Isn't that something? Jesus relates the *accomplishment* of *all* prophecy to the disappearance or passing away of heaven and earth. And then, ""Heaven and earth *will* pass away"" and relates it to the survival of specific words, ""but *my* words will never pass away"". He is stating again and again and *again*, for those who are willing to listen: When heaven and earth pass away (disappear) the Mosaic law will also disappear...but the words of Jesus will never disappear.

4 ‘He will wipe every tear from their eyes. There will be no more death’ or mourning or crying or pain

Call me crazy

Now there is one more interesting point to make about the Book of Revelation.

1 Then the angel showed me the river of the water of life, bearing twelve crops of fruit, yielding its fruit every month. (Revelation 22)

After the old heaven and the old earth have passed away (disappeared) humanity again has access to the Tree of Life.

Why is this important? As strange as it may sound, the Torah.

'It is a tree of life to those who take hold of it

Mankind recaptured that exalted spiritual plateau of Adam before his primeval sin at Sinai (Shabbos 145b) when the Jewish nation received the Torah – itself called Etz Chaim

http://www.torah.org/learning/livinglaw/5767/chukas.html

And this relates to something written in the Book of Hebrews...

23 It was necessary, but the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these. 24 For Christ did not enter a sanctuary made with human hands that was *only a copy of the true one*; he entered heaven itself, now to appear for us in God’s presence. (Hebrews 9)

So everything in the Holy of Holies was a copy of a heavenly thing. But what was in the Holy of Holies?

1 Now the first covenant had regulations for worship and also an earthly sanctuary. 2 A tabernacle was set up. In its first room were the lampstand and the table with its consecrated bread; this was called the Holy Place. 3 Behind the second curtain was a room called the Most Holy Place, and *the stone tablets of the covenant.* 5 Above the ark were the cherubim of the Glory, overshadowing the atonement cover. But we cannot discuss these things in detail now. (Hebrews 9)

Notice what was inside the ark? ""The stone tablets of the covenant."" The Law. The Torah. The earthly copy of the Tree of Life which is protected in heaven by what? The two cherubim..... which are *copied* on the cover of the Ark of the Covenant! Are you getting this yet?

The Tree of Life was the original Law. After the Fall of Man, was created as a replacement for (a copy of) the heavenly thing, the Tree of Life. When heaven and earth pass away (disappear) the Mosaic Law *also* disappears and it is replaced by the original Torah, the Tree of Life.

I have seen this in my own cultural subgroup of [Korean-Americans](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_American#Religion): [fan death](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fan_death) as an example of irrationality and maybe [this video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tmnMsGm6ZA) as an example of their sheeple behavior, although I'm sure everyone knows the Asian stereotypes already.  (This isn't meant to insult you, I'm just being brutally honest.  I expect the same in return.)

Just out of curiosity

A follow up: if you have a personal relationship with Him, why are you so special that you deserve face-time with the Big Man?  I honestly believed and tried for many years of my life and got nothing.  Why are some people easily given the evidence we atheists are so desperately seeking?  I would love for nothing more than to have a direct in with THE OMNIPOTENT CREATOR and for him to dote over me, and I would do almost anything for it, yet I have yet to hear from Him, not even cute little coincidences [like this](http://www.themoviespoiler.com/Spoilers/religulous.html):

The question goes: *A 90 year old man is lying on his death bed. He has been a good man for his entire life. Being a doctor, a pair of Christian missionaries comes to him, gives him a bible and asks him if he has ever heard about Jesus, which he, naturally, hasn't. They go on by giving him a 101 in Christianity and asks if he accepts Jesus Christ as his lord and savior, which he doesn't, the man dies without having admitted to Christianity. Will he go to heaven?*

Since the man in the story was introduced to Christianity and denied it, have answered either, *""yes""*, *""no""* or *""I don't know""*. In my opinion, all of these answers are flawed and here's why:

**Yes** - The man goes to heaven.

This would eliminate the need for a good person to be Christian in order to go to heaven after he/she dies. Now, suffering or fear in heaven, there are no such things as a ""better"" or ""worse"" place. It's all the same. Consequently, there's no point in being a Christian.

**No** - The man goes to hell.

This is the general opinion among Christians (I think), the only way to be allowed into heaven is by accepting Jesus Christ as your lord. If this is the case, it would also mean that any person who's lived a, by Christian standards) bad life may enter heaven as long as he abides to Christianity. This is when most Christians again bring up the possibility of getting to better or worse places in heaven, which, as stated previously, I call a moot point.

**I don't know** - The man goes... somewhere.

This is the one that bothers me. If a person claiming to be a Christian doesn't know whether or not a good but faithless person will be damned or not

But if it is logically possible to pick the good at each point in the series, then I think it is possible for every agent to do it. This means that there is a logically possible state of affairs where everyone always picks the good.

If it is a logically possible state of affairs, but does not, then he is not all good. And if God is necessarily omnipotent and all good then he does not exist.

Edit: I'll respond to the most popular objection.

Now your objection is that there aren't genuinely free choice in this world

When God creates he choses to actualize a particular possible world. So, my sinning is predetermined in the sense that in this world, it is true that I will sin. Now, this is the same kind of predetermining that would be involved in actualizing a world where everyone freely chooses not to sin. So, if this kind of predetermining destroys genuine moral choice in one world, it destroys it in all.

In the eyes of a missionary, or truly believe even if they claim it.  Is the innocence repealed for this people now that they have become aware?  What if the missionary is talking to a 60 year old man who spent his entire life believing in his cultures version of religion or spirituality?  Should he be truly expected to convert after all of that, especially when God has not given man any true evidence (gotta have faith) of His existence?

How do you resolve this?  There would have to be some threshold, but if there were missionaries in your area for a year, that was enough time.  At what point do they lose their innocence?  And if you believe the person shouldn't go to hell (now I say assuming they are a good man, but i feel like I've heard a lot of you say that belief in Christ is the requirement, good deeds alone will not get you into Heaven, correct me if I am wrong.) then why should someone born to the culture of a different religion, with little exposure to Christianity beyond what the average Christian hears about Buddhism, etc. go to hell as well?

It probably doesn't need to be covered

Where did the excess water come from and where did it go?

How long did it take Noah to round up all of the animals?

The size of the boat could not hold the volume of the animals which would have had to have been on the boat.

Neither could it have held the weight of the animals.

How did he manage to get all of the marsupials back to Australia and other animals which are only found in certain areas?

How did the animals not attack each other?

How were the animals fed? 40 days is a long time in terms of food.

So nothing happened to the fish?

The logistics of a single man and his family building a quality boat of that size.

I can not remember if the Bible addresses if other humans lived. If our entire population was reduced to Noah's family (and I want to say there is some loophole about others existing like with the who did Cain marry question.) it would be pretty obvious in our record of culture etc. You'd have to believe the descendants of Noah managed to populate the rest of the Earth in the last 5000 years.

Some of you may have seen the [thread a few days ago](http://www.reddit.com/r/DebateAChristian/comments/1iqrec/recruiting_mods/) about recruiting some new mods for a trial period. Some of you upvoted my ideas

1. Mod Transparency

I mentioned in my post in the aformentioned thread that I'd like to keep moderation transparent. There are a few options. The first is keeping a log of all deleted comments that anyone can view. I'm no web design genius, we can make a thread now and post links to (if they still work, I'm new at this) or screenshots of comments that we delete, so it's out in the open. Something /r/debatereligion do is have a team of WatchMods who can see mod logs, which is easy enough to do if there's support for that system

2. Post quality

Atheists and Christians alike have complained about post quality here, I'd be the last person to bow to political correctness in this. The basic rule that I'll be following is ""If a post is not conductive to discussion, it will be removed"". For example, a post simply saying ""God is an angry bigoted misogynistic blood God"" will likely be removed. A post starting with that line as an introduction, but then elaborating on each point, providing evidence (for example biblical references), and remaining respectful of those who disagree

Also remember that we don't read every single thread. If a post violates our posting guidelines

3. Repeated common questions

The current sidebar is not as good as I'd like it to be. There is a section linking to neverending debates

* How do you know Christianity's true?
* Why does God allow evil?
* Why don't Christians follow all Old Testament Commands?
* What would happen if we discovered aliens?
* Why is faith a virtue?

Each would have a bullet point in the sidebar linking to one or two examples of good discussions on the topic, or simply some text in it like there is now. It's my experience that people would rather click links than read text, and so I lean towards that.

Two other ideas that I've seen thrown around but that I'm undecided on: Removing the downvote button, informed responses to questions posed at Christians.

First picture the stereotypical mad scientist.  Living along in the darkness, and many others, the creators are driven mad.  Usually, the antagonist is the main character who combs the city looking for victims to harvest for body parts.

Similarly, he's said to be omniscient.  Only there is darkness, and it loves nothing as there is nothing to love.  So it creates a universe.  It's own world, complete with living creatures and people.

Now, the main deity character int he mythology goes on to kill millions of the people he's created for various selfish reasons.  

The first few commandments he communicates to his creation are purely narcissistic and jealous.  Throughout the Old Testament

He destroys an entire city, but he also destroys one of the victims of the incident (Lot's wife) for simply turning back to look at it when God told her not to.

It seems that above all else

If the bible wasn't read with the predetermination that the character is some all-knowing, and forgiving entity, then it would appear like the super-villain it is.  If it wasn't already the case, that millions of people actually believe the character to be real and deserving of fear, would it still be perceived as a ""good guy""?

Then there's the absurdity in the lack of limitations of this being.  There is literally nothing that can stop this thing.  As illustrated countless times throughout the saga

1337938324.0,u48zn,Why should I believe God is good when there is so much evidence to the contrary.,ThisIsMyRedditLogin,15,3,65,"I remember back in my Pentecostal days the Pastor used to say ""God is good"" and the congregation would respond ""all the time""

I'm convinced the God of the Bible isn't a good God.  The evidence is overwhelming.  Before I get to that evidence

So let's see some evidence for why I don't believe God is good.  Firstly, because God stuck a talking snake in the Garden, or allowed it in there.  I am, of course, assuming that God is omnipotent and omniscience (having knowledge of the past, present and future), attributes which Christians always assign to God.  So here we have a deity who has deliberately and with foreknowledge set his creation up for failure.  We all know how the story goes.  

Next up is the Flood.  Christians will often tell me that mankind was pure evil at this time

&gt;Genesis 6:5-8

&gt;5  The Lord saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth, “I will blot out man whom I have created from the face of the land, man and animals and creeping things and birds of the heavens, for I am sorry that I have made them.” 8 But Noah found favor in the eyes of the Lord.

But when I reply that innocent children and babies drowned in the flood, then we can be reasonably confident that innocent children and babies would have drowned too.  

Thirdly is the Exodus and the murderous conquest of Canaan.  God himself hardens Pharaoh's heart, so do not judge a woman who is not ready to have a child, or has been raped and does not want to raise her rapist's baby.  

God's crimes throughout Israel's wilderness wanderings are many, the Israelites heard about what had happened and were understandably upset.  They complained to Moses and Aaron about their people being killed (Numbers 16:41).  What is God's response against this complaint?  He sends a plague among them.  What is surprising about this part of the story is that even Moses and Aaron are appalled by God's temper tantrum.  Moses sends Aaron out into the ""congregation"" with incense in order to make atonement (Numbers 16:46-47).  Apparently God can be appeased by nice smells.  Sadly, Aaron wasn't quick enough and 14,700 people die as a result of God not being able to have a nice smell fill his nostrils (verse 49).  

Another example of God's complete lack of mercy, rather comically, tries twice to get Uriah to go home and spend the night with his wife).  With Uriah having died on the front lines, David takes Bathsheba as his wife and she bears him a son.  In 2 Samuel 12, God sends a prophet to David to rebuke him and David admits he sinned (2 Samuel 12:13).  Interestingly, God forgives David of his sin, but decides to punish David's son;

&gt; 2 Samuel 12:13-14

&gt;13  David said to Nathan, because by this deed you have utterly scorned the Lord, the child who is born to you shall die.”

David spends several days praying for the child

In one debate with a Christian on this

Another person responded to me by saying that David's son went to heaven after he died

Another example of God's good nature is the death of Ezekiel's wife.  As in the case of David, Ezekiel was **not** being punished for a sin.  God killed Ezekiel's wife simply because he could.  

&gt; Ezekiel 24:15-18

&gt;15 The word of the Lord came to me: 16  “Son of man, nor shall your tears run down. 17 Sigh, but not aloud; make no mourning for the dead. Bind on your turban, and put your shoes on your feet; do not cover your lips, nor eat the bread of men.” 18 So I spoke to the people in the morning, **and at evening my wife died**. And on the next morning I did as I was commanded.

Sickeningly

I believe the God of the Bible is evil.  He *says* he is good, it is clear that he deliberately and knowingly usurped his own creation, causing humanity to sin and bringing suffering into this world.  Since then, God has watched that suffering go on whilst doing nothing to alleviate it.  

This God also designed hell, I argue that even if that is true, God still designed hell and is thus still an evil sadist.  To the second group I argue that if they believe that God never intended humans to end up in hell, he shouldn't have made it.  I also point out to these folks that if they believe their God is omniscient and has foreknowledge of future events then God could not possibly have created hell without knowing beforehand that he would be putting humans there.  

There are other Christians who have tried to convince me that hell is **not** a place of eternal punishment and non-believers simply die while Christians go to heaven to eternally sing sweet songs to God about how important and nice he is.  I would like to remind such Christians that Jesus often promised that non-believers would go to a place where there is ""wailing and gnashing of teeth"" and where the ""worm does not die"" (whatever that means).  I would also like to remind them of the ""rich man and Lazarus"".  The rich man was in a place of torment.  It is fairly clear from the New Testament that God has a nasty punishment in store for those who **don't** want to eternally sing sweet songs to God about how important and nice he is.

The most common argument I see for Christians political stance against marriage is that it negatively affects the idea/concept/whatever of marriage.

*My question is this

1.  Does God think less of marriage?  Is he so upset by the unity of same sex couples that the overall value for marriage in God's eyes decreases so that each 'true' marriage loses a tiny amount of value to God when a gay couple marries?  

2.  If God doesn't accept the marriage as 'true'

3.  Is God upset with Christians for allowing these abominations?  If so

4.  In the Bible, just making a point.)  

5.  Is a homosexual couple adopting a child worse than the child staying with parents who didn't want them

For me

If gay marriage does not directly devalue each heterosexual marriage

... then if you're politically opposing gay marriage you are just attempting to deny them the civil rights of marriage.  It's not about religion at this point

Marriage is not a privilege

*If you're using the Bible to actively prevent the marriage of gays then you aren't making a religious argument

If I make an argument for genocide by quoting the bible

And for what?  What do you earn when you oppress them?  Will God reward you for preventing gays from seeing their loved one in the hospital?  For denying them tax benefits? 

Would you keep gay people from dating?  For dating for their entire lives?  From sharing a savings account to putting their names on a mortgage?  I assume not

And I will attempt to lay out the case of why it makes at least as much sense that God is evil as that he is good.  Why is God an patient father and not a bored kid playing the Sims?

First

I would like to begin by pointing out that all ""evidence"" for the omni-benevolence of God comes from sources that are supposedly either directly from or inspired by God.  There is no way to say that God couldn't have said one thing and secret intend to act evil.

Furthermore, in fact most of his acts increase the suffering of humanity.  The entirety of human suffering is a direct result of God cursing Adam and Eve, even if it was in retaliation for the original sin it increased human suffering.  Gods next important act was drowning the entirety of humanity save one family.  Fast forwarding through the rest of the OT we see God generally performing wanton acts of genocide and terror against anyone who displeases him (and sometimes innocent children).

Now to the tricky part: the NT and Jesus, this does nothing to proof Gods benevolence; to the contrary Jesus works very well into the plans of an evil god.  All earthly suffering has one hindrance, humans consent to endure it.  Almost all beings who suffer have it within their power to end their life.  In order to counter this a being would have to give his creation hope.  And I believe that most Christians would agree that more than anything Jesus attempts to be a message of hope.  It is the promises of Jesus that allows many to endure great hardship.  Which would merely give god more time to cause suffering.

Josephus, forty years after the death of Jesus, knew of Jesus but nothing of this raising of many and appearing to many.

Or at least many who had seen those many saints were still repeating the tale. Although people may have doubted that Jesus raised a few people while he was still alive and although ""some doubted"" Jesus' own resurrection (Matt. 28:17), who could fail to have been impressed by many risen saints appearing to many? How also could Peter have neglected to mention them in his Jerusalem speech a mere fifty days after they ""appeared to many in the holy city""? Surely their appearance must have been foremost on everyone's mind. So why didn't Paul mention such a thing in his letters, our earliest sources? Why did the women who visited the ""empty tomb"" on Sunday morning not take notice that many other tombs were likewise open?

1 Kings 8:63 - Solomon offered a sacrifice of fellowship offerings to the LORD: twenty-two thousand cattle and a hundred and twenty thousand sheep and goats. So the king and all the Israelites dedicated the temple of the LORD.

Some of the stories in the bible (ex. Noah's Ark) are outrageously opposed to what we observe today, simply because some geography in the bible matches archaeological evidence, it does not mean all of the bible is true.

My basic question is this: why would a loving, pounding it with His fists, other Christians interpret the passage as though God infected the helpless baby with some sort of disease. I personally find these discussions irrelevant and I encourage people not to be easily distracted by such minutia. I believe the most important fact is that a helpless, innocent baby was killed and the most important question is if a less savage, blood-thirsty option was available to an all-powerful, all-knowing, loving and magical God?

My core concern is this:

**If you believe that God is loving

Surely a loving, space or resources. For example, God could have made His voice so loud and compelling that King David (and perhaps everyone else) was absolutely compelled to comply. Also, I believe the argument of free will is invalid because what is more manipulative than killing a parent's baby?

So Christians

Was God correct to kill an innocent baby, loving God have the power, imagination, love and resources to achieve His plans without killing babies?

Please consider your answers carefully and please do not attempt to rush to justify murder in the name of your God.

**TL;DR: Why did God need to resort to brutalizing King David's innocent baby to death to achieve His goals? Was the all-powerful, why would He need to attack and kill a helpless baby?**

I am an agnostic theist

**-**

**GENESIS AND HISTORY** **--**


All events in the first eleven chapters of Genesis long predate Moses, as well.  Some argue that the **patriarchs (chs. 12-50)** are legends with only loose connections to actual people and events.  


**In order to sort through these issues


First we must have a clear definition of **history**.  In ordinary language


**In and of itself, free from divine activity, in strict chronological sequence, or with or without figurative and imaginative (mytholgical) elements.**  With this definition, we can obviously see that Genesis aims to record *actual* events, rather than mythological ones.  It explains how the Jewish ancestors came to be in Egypt; the genealogies connect Jacob to his children with ancient generations going back to Adam and Eve.  Further, the book is in **narrative prose**


The similarities between Genesis 1-11 to the other Mesopotamian stories actually support the conclusion that these chapters intend to record history.  The Mesopotamian stoies clearly aim to celebrate actual historical events, in that they recount the activities of the one true God.  **Recounting these events like history separated the Israelite narrative from those of the rest of Mesopotamia, serving the ultimate purpose of building religious and cultural identity.**  Genesis, like the Mesopotamian stories, provides the opening act of a grand narrative that conveys a **particular worldview**.  In order to provide the **necessary grounding** for this worldview, the author **needed to use real events** (albeit theologically interpreted).  In this way **Genesis aims to provide a true record of these events, in harmony with the biblical worldview.**  That worldview includes the notions that Yahweh, is the universal Creator of heaven and earth

At the same time, or even how long the creation period lasted.  There is not enough material here for a complete life of Abraham.  Even the name of the pharaoh that Joseph served is not mentioned.  It is possible through archaeological research to locate some of the Genesis events in ancient Near Eastern history, at least in order to offer a plausible scenario for them.  **But it remains true that Moses has not sought to provide a comprehensive retelling of ancient days; his purpose lay elsewhere.**

**-**
**-**

**GENESIS AND SCIENCE** **--**


**The relation of Genesis to science is primarily a question of how one reads the accounts of creation and falls (chs. 1-3) and of the flood (chs. 6-9).**  What kind of ""days"" does Genesis 1 describe?  How long ago is this supposed to have happened?  Were all species created as they are now?  Were Adam and Eve real people?  Are all people descended from them?  How much of the earth did Noah's flood cover?  How much of an impact did it have on geological formations?


Faithful interpreters have offered arguments for taking the creation week of Genesis 1 as a regular week with ordinary days **(the ""calender day"" reading)**; or as a sequence of geological ages **(the ""day-age"" reading)**; ir as God's ""work days, ""the earth was without form and void,"" describes a condition that resulted from Satan's primeval rebellion, which preceded creation **(""gap theory"")**.  **There have been other readings as well, but these five are the most common.**


**None of these views requires denying that Genesis 1 is historical, and earth, the sea, and all that is in them, and rested on the seventh day"": this passage echoes Genesis 1:1-2-3, the word ""day"" here need mean only what it means in Genesis 1, therefore it does not *require* an ordinary-day interpretation, and assessing these arguments would go beyond the goal of my initial post (we can talk about them in the comments).**


A further question involves the genealogies: do they describe direct father-to-son descent, ""to father"" can mean ""to become the ancestor of."" **In other words, the conventions for Hebrew genealogies allow for gaps; genealogies are not given to indicate a length of time.**


These issues become less pressing when it is recalled that **no biblical passage ever actually purports to count up the length of the creation week (outside of Exodus 20:11) and that no biblical author adds up the life spans in genealogies to compute absolute time.**


Should Genesis 1 be called a ""scientific account?""  Again


The account in Genesis is well cast for its main purpose, nor does it comment on what genetic relationship there might be between various creatures.  At the same time, when the passage is received according to its purpose (to build religious identity, and nationalism), it shapes a worldview in which science is at home.  **This is a concept of a world that a good and wise God made, perfectly suited for humans to enjoy, and to rule

**FAQ ABOUT GENESIS**


&gt;What kind of ""days"" does Genesis 1 describe? 

The ""days in Genesis are not described in the book-- but if the book is read according to its purpose


&gt;How long ago is this supposed to have happened? 


The creation story in Genesis offers no account of how long ago this took place, it is important to refer to good science, and trust that as far as we know the earth was formed roughly 4.56 billion years ago.

&gt;Were all species created as they are now? 


The Genesis account does not address the question, and so **we must trust in good science and the Theory of Evolution.**


&gt;Were Adam and Eve real people? Are all people descended from them? 


Although the writing style of Genesis would imply that Adam and Eve were historical figures


&gt;How much of the earth did Noah's flood cover? How much of an impact did it have on geological formations?


Given that flood stories in Mesopotamia are not rare (Epic of Gilgamesh), perhaps global, or perhaps localized in Mesopotamia.  This is unsupported by geological evidence, however, and so the second conclusion, that **the Israelites wanted their own flood story, as the other cultures had, and the number of deities.  This would imply that the flood narrative is another tool of cultural separation.

1367457625.0,1dism8,What’s the Difference Between the Old Covenant &amp; New Covenant in the Bible?,Happydazed,14,0,13,"*I post this because there always seems to be alot of confusion in debates about what was said in the OT vs the NT and why things like Deuteronomy don't apply anymore though many  insist they do.*

**What’s the Difference Between the Old Covenant &amp; New Covenant in the Bible?**

For a long time I was confused about the difference between what the Bible calls the “Old Covenant” and the “New Covenant.” I imagine many readers still struggle with some confusion between the two.

This post has been made in hopes of clearing up that confusion.

The Old Covenant was in effect during the time before Jesus’ death, or, the Old Law, and is associated with the Old Testament and the leadership of Moses.

The New Covenant went into effect after Jesus’ death, and is associated with the New Testament and the leadership of Jesus.

When I was in college a professor of mine named Dr. Phil Thompson presented my class with a handout put together by a man named Jack McKinney. I’d like to share the contents of that handout with you today as I’ve found them to be very helpful.

Jack McKinney uses 2 Corinthians 3 to compare/contrast the Old Covenant to the New Covenant in a way that really helped clear up a lot of confusion for me … check it out:

The Old Covenant vs. The New Covenant

Jeremiah 31:31-34

Old Covenant – Moses as Minister (2 Corinthians 3:13-15; John 1:17; Hebrews 3:5)
New Covenant - Jesus’ Disciples as Ministers (2 Corinthians 3:6; John 16:12-15)

Old Covenant - A Covenant of the Letter (2 Corinthians 3:6)
New Covenant - A Covenant of the Spirit (2 Corinthians 3:6-8)

Old Covenant - A Covenant which Kills (2 Corinthians 3:6)
New Covenant - A Covenant which Gives Life (2 Corinthians 3:6 – literally “makes alive”)

Old Covenant - A Ministry of Death (2 Corinthians 3:7)
New Covenant - A Ministry of Life (2 Corinthians 3:6)

Old Covenant - A Ministry of Condemnation (2 Corinthians 3:9)
New Covenant - A Ministration of Righteousness (2 Corinthians 3:9)

Old Covenant - A Covenant Written with Ink (2 Corinthians 3:3)
New Covenant - A Covenant Written with the Spirit of the Living God (2 Corinthians 3:3)

Old Covenant - A Covenant Written on Stone (2 Corinthians 3:3-7)
New Covenant - A Covenant Written on the Heart of Man (2 Corinthians 3:3; Jeremiah 31:33; Ezekiel 11:19-20; 36:26)

Old Covenant - A Covenant which came with Glory (2 Corinthians 3:7; Exodus 34:29-35)
New Covenant - A Covenant which came with the Greatest Glory (2 Corinthians 3:8-11)

Old Covenant - A Covenant whose Glory was Passing/Fading (2 Corinthians 3:7)
New Covenant - A Covenant whose Glory Continues to Shine (2 Corinthians 3:18)

Old Covenant - A Veiled or Covered Glory (2 Corinthians 3:12-16)
New Covenant - An Unveiled

Old Covenant - A Covenant Destined to be Done Away (2 Corinthians 3:11; Hebrews 7:12
New Covenant - A Covenant Destined to Last Forever (2 Corinthians 3:11; Hebrews 13:20)

McKinney goes on to note:

It was not merely the glory (GREEK: Doxa; cf. English “doxology”) which was transient in nature, where Paul speaks of the “ministry that brought death … engraved in letters on stone” coming with glory (NIV). It does not make sense to say that the glory of the Old Covenant “came with glory.” To understand this chapter, one must turn back to the situation in Exodus 34, and even then Paul’s argument may seem a bit strange to us. Still, his line of reasoning in one that is quite acceptable to that of the rabbinical interpretation of his time. It is not, of course, as if the Old Testament were of no value to the Christian. As the tutor or schoolmaster whose purpose was to lead to Christ, but the fact that “now that faith has come

I’ve retyped the original handout by Jack McKinney as it was given to me with a couple of minor changes (mostly typos)

That leads me to the question: what should we do with the teachings surrounding the Old Covenant today? Should we simply ignore them

I really appreciate the way Mark Driscoll explains this on pages 46 &amp; 47 of his book On the Old Testament (A Book You’ll Actually Read):

I have also been asked many times whether we need to obey all commands in the Old  Tesatment. The short answer regarding law is that all of the Old Testament commands/laws were fulfilled in Jesus Christ (Matthew 5:17-18). This does not mean that we do not love and value the Old Testament law. But it does mean that we are no longer under it. Similarly, and bring a note if I had been sick. Since the graduation requirements have been met, I am no longer bound to do those things. This does not mean they were bad, only that they are completed. However, there are some laws from high school that are still binding on me. For example, at my school I was not allowed to kill anyone, sell drugs, even though I have graduated.

Likewise

First, sacrifices, temple, and cleanness. These are now fulfilled in Jesus (for example, nearly the entire book of Hebrews addresses this issue for Jews who struggled with the Old Testament laws once they were saved). These laws are no longer binding on us because Jesus is our Priest, Sacrifice, Temple

Second, these laws, while insightful, are not directly binding on us. As Romans 13 says, we must now obey our pagan government because God will work through it, too.

Third, murdering, and lying. These laws are still binding on us even though Jesus fulfilled their requirements through His sinless life. Jesus Himself repeats and reinforces nine of the Ten Commandments. The only exception is the Sabbath, because that is part of the ceremonial law. Now our rest is in the finished work of Jesus, not just a day.

OP Edit: For me the actual answer to the above paragraph is stated in this:

&gt;Galatians 5:14 NLT New Living Translation

&gt;For the whole law can be summed up in this one command: ""Love your neighbor as yourself."" 

If you do this you do the law.

&gt;And now Caesar, as procurator. But the king deprived Joseph of the high priesthood, and bestowed the succession to that dignity on the son of Ananus, who was also himself called Ananus... Festus was now dead, and Albinus was but upon the road; so he assembled the sanhedrin of judges, and brought before them the brother of **Jesus, who was called Christ**, and some others; and when he had formed an accusation against them as breakers of the law

which is the one which is more authentic

&gt;Now there was about this time Jesus, a teacher of such men as receive the truth with pleasure. He drew over to him both many of the Jews and many of the Gentiles. He was [the] Christ. And when Pilate, at the suggestion of the principal men amongst us, had condemned him to the cross, those that loved him at the first did not forsake him; for he appeared to them alive again the third day; as the divine prophets had foretold these and ten thousand other wonderful things concerning him. And the tribe of Christians, so named from him, are not extinct at this day.

which is admitted by most scholars to be embellished or fabricated by church leaders. He basically recounted the execution of one guy, maybe you heard of him?"" and that was it. That's the only authentic reference to Christ in Josephus' *entire* works on the history of the region. The *Testimonium* reference isn't mentioned by anyone until the 300s, by an anonymous author. Origen, a Christian theologian from the 2nd century, was very familiar with the works of Josephus, but *never*, in all of his authentic works

That's terrible evidence. That's hardly anything!

Furthermore...

We don't have Josephus' original writings. There aren't any mentions of the first, so there's a *huge* gap in our knowledge of that document (hereafter, *Antiquities* in particular).

Because of the grammar in Greek, or that the church leaders (Eusebius, to be exact) added the *Antiquities* reference to correlate better with the *Flavium* passage that was embellished upon, but had some authenticity.

If the *Flavium* passage is an outright forgery, the Greek manuscripts do not attach significant meaning to ""Christ"" as a title, even though most of the English translations do. The Greeks at the time had a grammatical quirk where they would reiterate an article for no reason other than cadence. The truest English translation would simply say ""...Jesus, called Christ"".

1. What Christians call God is really just an inner voice that everyone has.
2. The Church tries to replace our inner voices with their own beliefs.
3. Therefore

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I'm talking about the generic notion of ""God"" as a force

Christians:

What if ""God"" was there all along before you converted or went to church or read the Bible? What if ""God"" was simply the voice of opposition within you that said ""yes"" when another part of you said ""no""? The voice that said ""no"" when another part of you said ""yes""? From early childhood

But Christianity teaches that we are all ignorant pagans without the *external* influence of the Bible and the Church. As such

I'm sure Christians will argue that the inner voice and Jesus are one and the same. But it's not that simple. Christianity demands belief in a whole package of ideas in addition to the belief in ""God"" as the inner voice of opposition to our own egotistical desires.

In addition to the aforementioned demand that Christians follow the scriptures as interpreted by the Church

I don't need to believe these things to know that the inner voice is real. I don't deny reality. I honor reality. I worship reality.

And I believe that we are all Jesus. The voice of ""God"" is the birthright of each one of us. As such we are all sons and daughters of ""God"" nurtured by the inner voice. And we are all crucified, of the true Self. Simply put: Jesus is a symbol, an archetype.

When I point out that Jesus himself said

It is this impulse that causes Christians to train their children to disbelieve and devalue their own internal experience of ""God"" in favor of an external perception of a book and a religion as *the* representation of God on Earth, Christian children are trained to believe God is the devil.

An object or thing which represents God is an idol. Christians demand that Christians be idol worshipers. But I maintain that ""God"" is not uniquely represented by a book or a religion or a man who lived 1

""God"" is not here in a unique collection of things and events. ""God"" is here in everything, the Christian insistence upon the occurrence of this supernatural event is a sign of doubt in the existence of the true God, not faith. Knowing the true God requires no faith.

If this is so then why is it that no one tries to pass off as metaphor the threatened punishments of the Christian god found in the OT?

""Yahveh shall send upon thee cursing, ... until thou be destroyed. ... Yahveh shall make the pestilence cleave unto thee, until he have consumed thee from off the land.... Yahveh shall smite thee with a consumption, and with a fever, and with an inflammation, and with an extreme burning, and with the sword, and with mildew. ... And thou shalt eat the fruit of thine own body

""Also every sickness, them will Yahveh bring upon thee, until thou be destroyed"" (Deut. 28:15-61).

Why isn't all of that metaphorical? We are spiritual people. We can be separated from God in this life. But no one claims that the tortures promised by the Christian god in the OT are metaphors.

It's pretty obvious to me that the temporal torments the Christian god threatened us with in the OT are the basis of the eternal torments the Christian god threatened us with in the NT. 

In the OT, in your fantasies.

And once the torments occur in your fantasies, those *other* people. That is exactly what Jesus did when he invented the eternal burning torment of hell. And, like Moses, he meant for his threats of torture to be taken literally. 

Revelation 14

10 they, which has been poured full strength into the cup of his wrath. They will be tormented with burning sulfur in the presence of the holy angels and of the Lamb. 11 And the smoke of their torment will rise for ever and ever.

http://sausageoffaith.blogspot.com/2013/08/limbo.html?m=1

Since the time of Augustine it was believed that all humans were born with original sin and if left unbaptized that sin would persist.

This was a particuarly big issue for new born babies.  In the pre modern era infant mortality was much higher and having a child die before it was baptised meant that it could not enter heaven.  The church taught that these unbaptised babies went to limbo instead....until 2007  

In 2007 an advisory body know as the International Theological Comission released a document written by Pope John Paul II that concluded that in fact unbaptised babies who not necessarily have to go to limbo.

-----------

Here is the wiki entry:

*On April 22, originally commissioned by Pope John Paul II, entitled ""The Hope of Salvation for Infants Who Die without Being Baptized.""[8] After tracing the history of the various opinions that have been and are held on the eternal fate of unbaptized infants, including that connected with the theory of the Limbo of Infants, and after examining the theological arguments, the document stated its conclusion as follows:
Our conclusion is that the many factors that we have considered above give serious theological and liturgical grounds for hope that unbaptized infants who die will be saved and enjoy the beatific vision. We emphasize that these are reasons for prayerful hope
What has been revealed to us is that the ordinary way of salvation is by the sacrament of baptism. None of the above considerations should be taken as qualifying the necessity of baptism or justifying delay in administering the sacrament. Rather, namely, to baptize them into the faith and life of the Church.
Pope Benedict XVI authorized publication of this document, the document explicitly states that ""the theory of limbo, understood as a state which includes the souls of infants who die subject to original sin and without baptism, and who, therefore, neither merit the beatific vision, nor yet are subjected to any punishment, elaborated by theologians beginning in the Middle Ages, but rather some degree of suffering in Hell. At any rate, just as is the theory of possible salvation for infants dying without baptism.*

----------

So the church took a step backwards here.  It went from being certain about something to not really being sure.  In the meanwhile

Does this situation cast doubt on the wisdom of the church and what do you say to someone who lost a child and was mislead by their religion into unnecessary suffering?

**TL;DR**

- 1) In 2 Kings 3:27 Yahweh not only admits the existence of the Moabite god

2 Kings 3:27
27 Then he (Mesha, and offered him as a sacrifice on the city wall. The fury against Israel was great; they withdrew and returned to their own land.

Maybe that's why Yahweh decided to sacrifice his firstborn son? So he could be more powerful?

Do you think it is inconceivable that a follower of Yahweh could acknowledge the existence of another god?

The biblical hero

23 “Now since the Lord, what right have you to take it over? 24Will you not take what your god Chemosh gives you? Likewise, whatever the Lord our God has given us, we will possess. (Judges 11)

- 2) The Hebrew text underlying the Septuagint reading of Deuteronomy 32:8-9 (below) from the most ancient available manuscript evidence (The Dead Sea Scrolls) reveals that Yahweh did indeed have 69 brothers.

""When the Most High (Elyon) assigned the nations their heritage
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
While the LORD’S own portion was Jacob
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
“Elyon”, translated “Lord”.

The polytheistic nature of this passage became clear with the discovery in 1929 of Ugarit (related to Hebrew) texts in modern-day Syria at Ras Shamra.  The texts confirmed some of the names of Israel’s deities including Elyon.

In fact, divided up the earth and his son Yahweh received the portion of the earth that came to be known as Israel.

http://triangulations.wordpress.com/2010/05/09/deuteronomy-328-9/

Literary and conceptual parallels discovered in the literature of Ugarit, El (who, like the God of the Bible, is also referred to as El Elyon, the ""Most High"") fathered seventy sons, thereby specifying the number of the ""sons of El"" (Ugaritic, bn il). An unmistakable linguistic parallel with the Hebrew text underlying the Septuagint reading was thus discovered

[DEUTERONOMY 32:8 AND THE SONS OF GOD](http://faculty.gordon.edu/hu/bi/Ted_Hildebrandt/OTeSources/05-Deuteronomy/Text/Articles/Heiser-Deut32-BS.htm)

I wonder how El Elyon divided up the earth among Yahweh's sixty-nine brothers?

We know that Yahweh's brother

- 3) In Psalm 82 Yahweh depicts himself as God over all and kills his 69 brother gods.

God presides in the great assembly;
    he renders judgment among the “gods”:

2 “How long will you defend the unjust
    and show partiality to the wicked?
3 Defend the weak and the fatherless;
    uphold the cause of the poor and the oppressed.
4 Rescue the weak and the needy;
    deliver them from the hand of the wicked.

5 “The ‘gods’ know nothing
    They walk about in darkness;
    all the foundations of the earth are shaken.

6 “I said
    you are all sons of the Most High.’
7 But you will die like mere mortals;
    you will fall like every other ruler.”

8 Rise up,
    for all the nations are your inheritance.
(Psalm 82)

""The final editors of the Hebrew canon were fervent monotheists, none of the available English translations does justice to the original Hebrew of Genesis 31:13, which quite simply reads ""I am the god Bethel"" ('El Bet'el), who was a member of the Canaanite pantheon along with the rest of the above.4 The original meaning is therefore quite different from the traditional understanding: this god at Bethel is not the universal Lord who appeared at Bethel but just one god among many – a local deity of a specific place.""

http://www.webpages.uidaho.edu/ngier/henotheism.htm

Throughout the ancient Semitic world

The God of Abraham and the God of Nahor, (Genesis 31:53, RSV)

Just like many of the other verses we have looked at

The Elohim of Abraham and the Elohim of Nahhor, and Jacob swore with the fear of his father Isaac.

Note that the Hebrew states,"" therefore we are looking at two different Elohim, one belonging to Abraham (the ancestor of Jacob) and the other to Nahhor (the ancestor of Laban). Because we are looking at two different Elohim, the Elohim in the phrase ""the Elohim of their father"" must be used in the plural sense.

In the Septuagint[1]

https://sites.google.com/site/yahwehelohiym/sons-of-god/the-el-of-a-family

Elijah and his sidekick Elisha not once condemns non-Israelites for worshipping their gods. Smith says “When Naaman begged a little earth that he might make a Yahweh-sanctuary in Damascus

http://toby.weebly.com/hebrew-henotheism.html

- 4) BTW

2 Kings 3 

14 Elisha said, if I did not have respect for the presence of Jehoshaphat king of Judah, I would not pay any attention to you. 15 But now bring me a harpist.”

While the harpist was playing, yet this valley will be filled with water, and you, your cattle and your other animals will drink. 18 This is an easy thing in the eyes of **the Lord; he will also deliver Moab into your hands.** 19 You will overthrow every fortified city and every major town. You will cut down every good tree, stop up all the springs, and ruin every good field with stones.”

As a result of the war

If Moab was a football and Yahweh delivered Moab into Israel's hands

Elisha is a false prophet.

According to the Christian god's law

19 I myself will call to account anyone who does not listen to my words that the prophet speaks in my name. 20 But **a prophet who presumes to speak in my name anything I have not commanded**

21 You may say to yourselves, so do not be alarmed. (Deuteronomy 18)

So Elisha was a false prophet. And since Yahweh failed to act on his highly developed sense of so-called “justice” (by having Elisha put to death as a false prophet)

Or maybe sometimes the True God simply fails to act on his highly developed sense of so-called “justice”.",,t5_2ryd5,1374798832.0,,violet brackets,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/DebateAChristian/comments/1iqx44/chemosh_1_yahweh_0/

While I think self-interest is a legitimate partial motivation for morality, say, selflessness.

Can any of my Christian co-redditors assist me in finding moral quotes by Jesus that don't entail either divine reward or punishment as a primary (or even incidental) motivating factor for beliefs / behaviors?

Yet when you ask a Christian what Torah means or truth or life, they quote Paul, on the contrary only warnings of false teachers after Jesus are given, which Jesus said is an automatic sign of a false prophet, (7) he claims to still be a Pharisee during his ministry (Jesus warns about this too).

&gt;For the record

What's your definition of true Christianity? I would say that it is identified by a 100% devotion to and following of the Bible. **Is that a reasonable definition: that the best Christians are those that follow their scriptures most closely?**

**If so, why they believe the earth is 6000 years old, and why they don't let their kids read Harry Potter because it's ""witchcraft."" Fundies are ridiculous because the Bible is ridiculous.

**On the other hand, you know that what fundies do is ridiculous, regardless of what the Bible says. So, you water down the Bible, taking just the nice happy parts and calling that true Christianity.

**Thank the universe that the vast majority of ""Christians"" do not take most of their own religion seriously.**

2. God knows all things. If there is even one thing God does not know

With those two things in mind

At one point, reviews his plan, then goes through with creating it. God has an idea to create the universe. Because he knows all things, he knows every single event that will take place within the universe BEFORE he even creates it. God develops a plan for the universe, reviews his plan for the universe, then creates the universe.

 Scale this down to the creation of human kind. God develops a plan for human kind, the humans will choose sin.

TL:DR - My question boils down to this. If God knew the results of the test he designed for human kind (God vs. Sin) BEFORE he even went through with creating it
