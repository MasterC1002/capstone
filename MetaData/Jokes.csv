I'll tell ya, and I donate money to the topless!

One night I came home. I figured

I asked my old man if I could go ice-skating on the lake. He told me

My doctor told me to watch my drinking. Now I drink in front of a mirror. I drink too much. Way too much. My doctor drew blood. He ran a tab.

When I was born the doctor came out to the waiting room and said to my father

I come from a stupid family. During the Civil War my great uncle fought for the west!

My father was stupid. He worked in a bank and they caught him stealing pens.

My mother had morning sickness after I was born.

My mother never breast fed me. She told me that she only liked me as a friend.

My father carries around the picture of the kid who came with his wallet.

When I played in the sandbox the cat kept covering me up.

I could tell that my parents hated me. My bath toys were a toaster and a radio.

One year they wanted to make me poster boy... for birth control.

I remember the time I was kidnapped and they sent back a piece of my finger to my father. He said he wanted more proof.

My uncle's dying wish was to have me sitting on his lap. He was in the electric chair.

One time I went to a hotel. I asked the bellhop to handle my bag. He felt up my wife!

This morning when I put on my underwear I could hear the Fruit of the Loom guys laughing at me.

I'm a bad lover. Once I caught a peeping tom booing me.

My wife only has sex with me for a purpose. Last night she used me to time an egg.

It's tough to stay married. My wife kisses the dog on the lips

My wife isn't very bright. The other day she was at the store, ""Did you see the guy that did it?"" She said, ""No, but I got the license plate.""

Last night my wife met me at the front door. She was wearing a sexy negligee. The only trouble was

A girl phoned me and said

A hooker once told me she had a headache.

I went to a massage parlor. It was self service.

I had a lot of pimples too. One day I fell asleep in a library. I woke up and a blind man was reading my face.

My wife made me join a bridge club. I jump off next Tuesday.

I met the surgeon general. He offered me a cigarette.

When I was born the doctor took one look at my face, twins!""

With my wife I don't get no respect. I made a toast on her birthday to 'the best woman a man ever had.' The waiter joined me.

""Because you stepped on a duck, you are condemned to spend the rest of you time in the Kingdom shackled to this person. Have a good eternity.""  The angel shackles the two together and flies off.

After some time
Except there is one enemy soldier in the distance.
The enemy soldier is not aiming a gun or anything. He is simply walking towards the broom wielding soldier while mumbling something.
The soldier aims his broom and fires
He continues trying over and over
The soldier gets close
The soldier finally reaches him
He literally crushes him just walking over him.

The moon was high

All alone just she and I

Her hair was soft

Her eyes were blue

I knew just what

She wanted to do

Her skin so soft

Her legs so fine

I ran my fingers

Down her spine

But I tried my best

I started by placing

My hands on her breast

I remember my fear

My fast beating heart

But slowly she spread

Her legs apart

And when I did it

I felt no shame

All at once

The white stuff came

At last it's finished

It's all over now

My first time ever

At milking a cow...

1352846139.0,135b8p,Anger Management,SpacedWizard,1012,359,51,"I was sitting at my desk when I remembered a phone call I'd forgotten to make. 

I found the number and dialed it. 

A man answered

I politely said
'This is Chris. Could I please speak with Robyn Carter?' 

Suddenly a manic voice yelled out in my ear 
'Get the right f***ing number!' 
And the phone was slammed down on me. 

I couldn't believe that anyone could be so rude. 

When I tracked down Robyn's correct number to call her
I found that I had accidentally transposed the last two digits. 

After hanging up with her

When the same guy answered the phone
And hung up. 

I wrote his number down with the word 'asshole' next to it
And put it in my desk drawer. 

Every couple of weeks
I'd call him up and yell

It always cheered me up. 

When Caller ID was introduced

So, this is John Smith from the telephone company. 
I'm calling to see if you're familiar with our Caller ID Program?' 

He yelled 'NO!' And slammed down the phone. 

I quickly called him back and said
And hung up. 

One day I was at the store

Some guy in a black BMW cut me off and pulled into the spot I had patiently waited for. 

I hit the horn and yelled that I'd been waiting for that spot

I noticed a 'For Sale' sign in his back window

A couple of days later
I thought that I'd better call the BMW asshole

I said

He said

I then asked

He said, in Fairfax 
It's a yellow ranch style house And the car's parked right out in front.' 

I asked

He said

I asked

He said

I said, can I tell you something?' 

He said

Then I came up with an idea... 

I called asshole #1. 

He said

I said
(But I didn't hang up.) 

He asked

I said

He screamed

I said

He asked

I said

He said

I said, in Fairfax, a yellow ranch style home and I have a black Beamer parked in front.' 

He said
And you had better start saying your prayers.' 

I said, asshole,' and hung up. 

Then I called Asshole #2. 

He said

I said,' 

He yelled

I said

He exclaimed

I answered, here's your chance. 
I'm coming over right now.' 

Then I hung up and immediately called the police, to kill my gay lover. 

Then I called Channel 7 News about the gang war going down in Oaktree Blvd in Fairfax .
I quickly got into my car and headed over to Fairfax . 

I got there just in time to watch two assholes beating the crap out of each other in front of six cop cars

NOW I feel much better.
