I keep seeing posts requesting a basic introduction to amateur radio for the unfamiliar

First off, you use it to get around without a car*""


**OK

Primarily HAM radio is a set of radio frequency bands set aside for use by everyday people. It cannot be used for broadcasting (especially music), emergency communications, and sending/receiving digital data. [A good list of the available frequencies can be found on wikipedia.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amateur_radio_frequency_allocations#ITU_Region_2)


**But don't you need a license?**

Yes

* tests and licenses normally cost less than $20 US

* licenses are good for 10 years (do not need to re-test to renew)

* The pool of questions on the tests are all [published with the answers](http://www.arrl.org/question-pools)

* Nearly every area has a [HAM radio club](http://www.arrl.org/find-a-club) willing to help you

**What kind of equipment do I need

* For the 160 to 10 meter bands

* For the other bands

* For the 70 centimeter band you need a [70 centimeter radio(also called a 440 radio)](http://electronics.shop.ebay.com/i.html?_nkw=%2870+cm%2C+440%29&amp;_sacat=40065&amp;_sop=1&amp;_dmd=1&amp;_odkw=%2870+cm%2C+440%29&amp;_osacat=40065&amp;_trksid=p3286.c0.m270.l1313)

* etc

* Also


**What license is needed for each band?**

* The first level of license is called ""*Technician*"". This gives you unlimited access to all frequencies above 30Mhz. 

* The second level of license is ""*General*"". This allows access to everything technician allows **plus** access to most frequencies below 30 Mhz

* The highest level of license is ""*Extra*"". This allows the use of all frequencies allocated to amateur radio.

* *Also


**How can I see what this is all about?**

* To checkout the HF bands

* For decoding the digital noises

* For a simple intro on how HF waves travel around the world

* Checkout the #hamradio room on the freenode


**What other interesting stuff do people do with amateur radio?**

* [Chat keyboard-to-keyboard around the world](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PSK31)

* Run beacons which [test the propagation of HF radio waves](http://wsprnet.org/drupal/wsprnet/map)

* Connect local [repeaters](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repeater) together [over the internet using Voice over IP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IRLP)

* [Communicate using satellites](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSCAR) (yes

* Setup long-range TCP/IP networks using 802.11a/g hardware. [The 2.4Ghz and 5.8Ghz WiFi bands overlap into amateur radio bands](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-speed_multimedia_radio)

What's unique about our subreddit is that we're not dependent on a 3rd party who can silence us (within reason - jammers and annoyances aside).

My proposal:  On the 18th of January

Does anyone have opinions or suggestions on this?  ~~Some coordination can occur all day long on IRC~~

Thoughts?  Opinions?  Suggestions?

Also - we might be able to get some shameless advertising on this.  Perhaps an IAmA post ""We are the amateur radio operators of Reddit from [/r/amateurradio](/r/amateurradio) who will be on the air while Reddit shut downs for 12 hours, licensing requirements, etc etc.  Also provide many WebSDR means for others to listen in if interested.

Thanks to all of the redditors who offered tips and encouragement!  It took a fair amount of studying and cramming, though.  They suggested that people who passed a particular exam should try the next level exam, just to see if they might be able to pass it.  Also, I didn't realize it, but you can take the same exam again as a different version if you want.  It will cost you another $15, though.

However, I would say about 30% of my knowledge is deep, 40% is normal, and 30% is shallow.  That's not anything  I would want to brag about.

About half way there the head tube basically cracked off the front of the bike. It's now useless and a huge pain to carry anywhere. I reach into my pocket to find my ipod instead of my phone. Great. Took about 20 seconds for the light to go off. I jumped on the w7dk repeater, this one has no auto patch. Then another dude gets on, says the same thing, but then offers to make the call for me. Yes! The rest is obvious and I was picked up in 10 minutes. So cool. 

Just wanted to share that cause I'm new to the hobby and I was quite taken by the novelty of the experience. And also of not having to trudge home! I know this kind of thing happens all the time but for me this was my first 'real' use of amateur radio aside from little tests here and there or talking to my buddy over irlp. So

**Summary:** Front of my bike broke off. Left my phone at home. Through the local repeater got another ham who called a friend of mine and I was picked up in minutes. It was awesome!

I had never had any experience with broadcasting other than a pair of wrist walkie-talkies from Fry's that wouldn't receive a signal transmitted from down the street.

First things first, 2 IDs (one picture ID) and a pencil/pen).

Next up was learning materials. I had wonderful success with KB6NUs [""No-nonsense No-code Technician's Class License Study Guide""](http://www.kb6nu.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/2010_Tech_Study_Guide.pdf) and [Patrick J Maloney's Technician Class iOS testing app]( http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/amateur-radio-exam-prep-technician/id297951496?mt=8).

Now that I was starting to feel prepared for the test, but  **an amazing redditor named [SpeedGeek](http://www.reddit.com/user/SpeedGeek)** passed down a very gently used Icom W2A and a host of accessories, refusing any payment but giving the condition that I do everything I can to get more people into the hobby (my buddy is taking his text in Vegas next month, SpeedGeek). Needless to say, I happily agreed :)

After receiving the radio in the mail, scanning and doing anything else I could with the radio short of actually hitting that 'transmit' button. I like to say that period is like trying to learn programming by watching other people code, but not being allowed to actually touch the keyboard. Very frustrating.

On the 6th, and one guy was teting up to Extra. There was even a 7 year old girl taking her technician's exam. She passed, in case any of you were wondering.

The test itself was very simple. It consists of 35 multiple choice questions

Last friday, I've found some local repeaters and stumbled across some LEO frequencies (radio drama ftw) and tried a couple times to make a QSO, but I have, as of yet, been unsuccessful. I will not, however, give up. :)

I just wanted to write this up in hopes that someone else that has found this subreddit might be motivated to take the plunge and get your license!

Every year or so I get the idea to go to a local club meeting thinking it will be somehow different than last time. Every year I am disappointed. I took my daughter (age 6) to the local club meeting tonight.

While daughter sat quietly before the meeting completing her homework, so there was some noise. Abnormal ruckus, I assumed; soon to be rectified.

When the program started, so we were already straining to hear. The room was a very narrow rectangle and not conducive to any presentation. A public address system of some kind would have worked wonders. These are hams, let's try to conquer the sound amplification thing.

Meanwhile, giggled and hooted about everything from their next cake baking party to Beyonce's wardrobe from the half-time show. I cannot pay attention to a strained elderly voice of wisdom while listening to this ruckus. Meanwhile, my 6 year old daughter sat quietly; after all, we'd just had a talk about how it's rude to speak when others are talking. What an angel.

An evidently ""long time"" member of the club came barging into the room late. Most people at the meeting weren't exactly competing for style awards

The same fellow's phone rang, by evidently hard of hearing men, confused the room even more.

When he returned from his phone call, a giant belch that turned some heads. He shuffled over the ladies table and began to lay on the game. He could not control the tone of his voice.

Whoo.  Now I'm about to sit in the parking lot for lunch-hour and see if I can get any more.  I was driving around and got a busted QSL from Italy(?).

I see a lot of newbies coming in, and questions are many and complex. A forum like this is a great place to glean information and ask specific questions, but it can leave big holes.

So, or going from clueless noob to DXCC. If you're not in the Great Lakes region, I'd be happy to help online, but if you're within a 2 hour drive of Meadville, PA, I'll mentor folks face to face as well.

A few qualifications:
Licensed 10 years next month, Tropo, QRP, Aeronautical Mobile, Land mobile, antenna and transceiver homebrew, contesting, etc.

Perhaps my biggest qualification: I've been told I'm 'not dangerous

So

If other members are interested in offering up their services as an Elmer one-on-one

**EDIT:** Fellow Elmers, and by PM. I can help everyone I've heard from so far, but it might come to a point where that isn't the case in the very near future.

**EDIT 2: (1/05/2012)** I'm heading out for the weekend on vacation, don't despair. My fellow Elmers are starting to find their way into the thread, and hopefully they can pick up some of the slack until I return.

The FCC is under many more constraints than when Riley Hollingsworth was in the Enforcement position plus having fewer people to follow up on cases.  Most of us can’t appreciate the ramifications of this and simply see slow response as a sign of lack of interest in enforcement on the amateur bands.  This is not true, it is just the fact that there is more red tape to go through and the FCC has to have the needed documentation, otherwise the case is likely to be thrown out.

 

Since letters went out regarding interference on 14313 several months ago, unacceptable behavior remains.  Work is continuing by the FCC there to address the remaining issues.""

I haven't talked much with him about his radio stuff so I don't know if there's any significance behind it or if it's just randomly assigned.  

I don't talk to him often cause he's in England right now (I'm  American) and We're rarely both on skype at the same time.  I kinda miss him so I should probably log on now.  :/

Hovering around the bottom of 20M, and waited. He responded and, I heard my call repeated, then his. I got the fill I needed on the last letter.

Then he started the QSO, as I recall. Then I took a deep breath and focused only on what was being sent, without beating myself up about what I had missed. I copied (poorly) his name (which I later confirmed on QRZ) and city. He turned it back to me, I heard my call again (God knows I had sent it enough during practice with just the sidetone of the radio to recognize it). I'm really doing this, I thought.

Back to me, and then ""SRY I AM SO SLOW MY 1ST QSO JASON HERE. BTU"" Except, I screwed up on sending the ""Y"" in ""SRY,"" so there was a little rough spot. And then, nothing but silence. Well, S3-level noise, but no reply. Damn, and I'm pretty sure I'll never make a real CW QSO.  So

Then, but rather a new email, indicating he probably looked me up on QRZ, too. He says his computer crashed when he turned it back to me and it locked his radio in transmit. He missed my reply and by the time he got back, another QSO had started. Anyway, he then replied to my email and said my signal was excellent and I did really well for the first time. He has agreed to work with me later this week to help build my speed.

I logged it, it was cool. I think I'm hooked on CW.

1363211607.0,1a8sds,May I ask some questions about spark-gap  transmitters?,Marauder,36,1,19,"I figured if anyone knew about transmitters and antennas it would be this group. In an attempt to understand why antennas radiate electromagnetic waves I have gone back to studying the first transmitter – the spark gap transmitter.  I'm working my way forward from there.  Anyway.... [I found this page](http://resonanceswavesandfields.blogspot.com/2007_06_01_archive.html) with a flash animation of a simple spark gap generator and a description of its operation.  It is pretty straightforward and I get it.  My questions


1.)	That battery is going to need serious potential to provide the necessary voltage for a spark to jump the gap.  I’m assuming that the voltage and current capacity of the battery and the charging capacitor Cc are what determine the transmitter power output before accounting for gain from the antenna.  Is this correct? I'm guessing in real SG transmitters this would actually be the output from an induction coil.


2.)	I am assuming the impulse from the current jumping the gap is analogous to the thwack of ringing a bell.  The thwack is needed to create the resonance in the LC circuit (to which the antenna is attached).  Modern transmitters don’t need to do this because they set up a continuous wave that is used for the carrier.  Correct so far?


3.)	The resonant frequency of the LC circuit *could* be set up for low frequency ranges (say 60Hz) but it would be pointless because A.) Low frequency waves have low energy so they aren’t going to go very far and B.) the antenna length needs to be ½ the wavelength of the resonant wave for the antenna to be an effective radiator.   (And resonance is key to creating an effective radiator?) A 60Hz wave would require an antenna miles long so it isn’t practical to attempt to broadcast on waves much longer than say 600 kHz. Am I still on track?


4.)	Finally…. I don’t completely understand why the spark gap transmitter transmits over such a wide band (and thus are illegal everywhere).  I assume it is because the resonance in the rather primitive LC circuit is very imprecise.  So even though you size the coil and capacitor to generate a 600Khz wave it actually generates a messy wave that can be anywhere from say 100khz to 1.2 mHz (or worse).   Can someone clarify why they are so imprecise in their transmission?

Sorry for the wall of text.  If you can help in anyway or point me towards good resources

I started a thread last night in this subreddit asking all non-licensed readers to list their biggest roadblocks to getting licensed, and a lot of input on issues that need to be addressed.

Perhaps one of the more surprising conclusions I came to is: Most people who believe they have some significant obstacle to overcome actually just have too little, to fairly complex issues resulting from the highly fragmented nature of information regarding amateur radio on the internet at large. it was encouraging though, to see that many of these people  (I had more than 2 dozen newbies reply) could probably be helped in such a way as to make it practical for them  to become licensed within just a few weeks time.

So, and, big surprise, it's **MONEY!**

If you google around, and those purchases tend to be for what I call 'peripheral gear'. Actual radio purchases are usually less common than that. 

People assume that the hobby is extremely expensive

Let's break down the costs of getting started from scratch. You walk up to me today and say ""I want to be a ham!"" No equipment, no study material, nothing.

The first (potential) expense is going to be study material. This is going to focus on US hams, we're going to divide it into media. First and most popular are paper study guides. Books. Gordon West, ARRL, Ham Radio For Dummies, there are lots. Most of these, unless you happen to find a recent licensee who might be willing to loan you a current book, run between $17 and $30. 

The second is CDs and DVDs. Software mostly

Then we're on to the free resources. The first stop for any new ham who's looking to study without spending money needs to be the [Technician Class Question Pool](http://www.ncvec.org/page.php?id=349). The pool is available in several formats like MS Word, you have *every* question they could possibly ask you on the test, in it's complete and correct form. With the answers. Free.

Seriously.

The only thing they can change is what order the answers are in. So A can become D

Once you have these, and explaining the answers and how to get them. He just runs through the entire question pool one question at a time. Google and /amateurradio can explain how those answers come about though.

There are also a number of websites that allow you to take practice tests online. [QRZ](http://www.qrz.com/ht/) is probably one of the most popular one

[AA9PW](http://aa9pw.com/)  
[HamTestOnline](http://www.hamradiolicenseexam.com/) (**This one isn't free** but it is a decent value)  
[HamExam.Org](http://hamexam.org/)  
[eHam.net](http://www.eham.net/exams/)  
[RadioExam.Org](http://www.radioexam.org/)  

There are also a number of apps for iPhone and Android out there that do the same thing.

These are just a few options. There are many, while ignoring other questions. Some sites like QRZ have methods of avoiding this problem, but it still isn't a bad idea to switch it up now and then. We'll get more into study methods and tactics in a later installment.

So, writing utensils, sometimes venue rental, etc. Not all VEs are ARRL VEs, and some don't charge fees PERIOD. The [Laurel VEC](http://larcmd.org/vec/index.php?pg=teams) is one such group. Your license must be renewed every 10 years. At this time, there are *NO* fees levied by the FCC for any step of this process **UNLESS** you want a vanity callsign. Then it costs something like $21 initially and every 10 years.

At this point, and your preferred method of studying.

Now you want to get on the air. You need a radio, other individuals, or even fully functional HF radios from your PC or phone. It may not be quite as much fun, or quite as flexible as a real radio, but as a way to get started, it's not half bad.

**You're on the air. You've spent $0 (ok

If you've got a local club that's doing well in your area, to massive University ham radio clubs (*MANY* large universities and colleges have a radio club!). As an added bonus, many times new hams will discover that radios magically materialize from closets, sheds, and storage units when a newbie shows up. People will loan out radios that are gathering dust on the shelf. I personally was loaned a $3,500 radio shortly after upgrading to General!

Echolink is cool and all, **DO NOT FIXATE ON NEW!!**. We hams tend to take pretty good care of our equipment. It is very often a point of personal pride. When new radios come into the shack, often old ones go up for sale to finance the purchase. The used market is strong right now.

Hamfests are a good start. I got my niece on the air this summer for $50 with a Kenwood dual band HT that just needed a new battery pack. Got everything we needed at her first hamfest.

Also, there is one place online I have always been comfortable buying used gear. [QRZ has a Sale &amp; Trade Board!](http://forums.qrz.com/forumdisplay.php?7-Ham-Radio-Gear-For-Sale). 

Use some caution, and sold gear there as well. I've never been dissappointed, and I've gotten some stellar deals. Hams there have their personal reputation at stake, because there are a *lot* of hams that are members of QRZ. Word gets around quick if you're a scam artist.

The key with buying gear is **PATIENCE**. If you don't see a good deal in your price range, or another paycheck. It will pay off in the end.

So with that first HT, the Carribbean, and big chunks of Central America with 5w and a $20 antenna. If you prefer to buy new, there's a new company in the market that is a great first radio. [Woxoun](http://www.wouxun.com/) radios are turning up everywhere these days, and AES is now a dealer for them (At least, the one in Cleveland is). These are the Honda Civic of the new radio world. They've got a decent set of features, they're reasonably reliable, they're VERY affordable. The 5w dualbander

You're now talking to stations all over the US

I would be more than happy to answer individual questions, or email. If you're in the Pittsburgh, PA area, I would be happy to work face to face. If you're out of the US, I'll try and set you up with someone in your country who can walk you through the process.

I found the local club, but I don't think they foster a good environment for young folks like me (I'm 23) to learn and do more. The club barely participates in anything, tasked me with editing the web site and newsletter knowing I don't know all that much, and doesn't seem to want to help out. As a result we have a new web site with old content and I have yet to release a newsletter since I have nothing to put in it. It needs a changing of the guard and I don't think it will happen anytime soon.

Would it be bad etiquette to completely bypass the existing club and get some 35-and-under hams together to do something different? I really want to keep the hobby from literally dying out and I feel that's the only way I can do something about it. Has anyone else done this and/or had any success? Any other generalized pointers on attracting young people to amateur radio would be good,False,self,t5_2qi86,False,,default,t3_jday4

This is the best piece of advice that any of the older hams have ever passed down to me because its the absolute truth. I've been a ham for a few years now and have seen many new hams make the antenna an after thought. They go into a ham store and plop the majority of their money down on a shiny new ham radio like a Kenwood TS-590S, because they are. But when you have a shitty or poorly thought out antenna setup those shiny new DSP based radios aren't going to perform any better on the air then something made in the 70's or 80's attached to a good antenna setup.

I have personally never owned a radio that wasn't built in the 80's except for my Yaesu FT-817 qrp rig. I've always focused on the antenna in any given situation and tried to think outside of the box when doing my research. I've always been told I sound just as good as the newer radio setups and some have even expressed disbelief I was QRP or only running 100 watts. So if you're new to HF

Problem is, if you will. I don't really know many people that are hams, so studying the books and passing the test is one thing, but it's kinda like getting your driver's license (I guess) - reading the manual and 'knowing' the answers is a lot different from actual driving a car. So...

1. How long does it take to get your call sign? I read it normally take 3-4 day to show up in the ULS database?
2. Is there a map, but I haven't been able to find a good map of repeaters.
3. My dad took the test with me and passed his tech - I would like to get him a cheap 'starter' radio that is decent quality. I was thinking of the UV-5R
4. Repeater Callsigns - are they the callsigns of the repeaters themselves? Or the callsigns of the ham that runs the repeater? And I've noticed that there are multiple repeaters with different callsigns

I'm sure I have a billion more questions

Thanks!

EDIT: Another question. Is there an easy way to find repeaters for a city I travel to? Or is it just a matter of getting onto a directory and searching the city and seeing which ones I have luck with as I drive through?

Also, will the repeaters still run (assuming they weren't damaged during the disaster), or would you most likely be relegated to simplex?

Perspective: 16 hours before our ARES activation we were planning our Field Day activities at Scott’s home.  That was late Wednesday night.

We were placed on standby 0900h Thursday and activated at 1330h.  I departed my workplace at 1400h and arrived at the EOC approximately 1630h faced by several road closures and hampered by clogged and failed cellular networks and in-town roadways

The EOC had already been evacuated to its backup location at the High River Firehall when I arrived with talk of moving again being forced by water levels increasing rapidly.  We bugged out about 2 hours later and drove 100km around road closures to the Nanton Firehall, then my truck (1h), then Nanton Firehall (2h), then my truck (.5h), then High River Firehall – so we split the operations as a result of being forced from our Firehall but still needing to run a controlled net.  That turned out to be a key differentiator allowing us to focus 100% on the task at hand.

Net Control’s roles were to schedule workers and report them provincially.  Net Control was staffed with some less experienced amateurs however they were very well organized with up to 4 people at a time working in it and two nearby but off-duty.  They rotated OPs every 2 hours to give breaks.  They totally self-organized.  I also told them to pair less experienced amateurs with more experienced allowing the newbies to learn and grow.

I gave Scott directions over the phone while driving away from the Town’s Firehall when we bugged out threatened by water.  I told him to set expectations with volunteers that they may deploy into a disaster zone and needed to come prepared with rubber boots and shoes, everything from longwires to Buddipoles to those with multiple HTs, 4x4s and generators.  There was talk of deploying via Helicopter to the local Hospital.

We worked closely with many agencies including the Provincial Operations Centre, Alberta Health Services and of course the Town of High River.  We also coordinated our activities with other ARES units in the province.  Simply put, we couldn’t have done this without the high level of coordination and cooperation among ARES teams.  It worked well and should be used again.  Along the way our mission became twofold; to help the Town of High River and to help AHS.  We dealt with the AHS traffic from our position in the EOC and in cooperation with the POC.

The operations in an EOC are controlled chaos.  We are privy to much information that is highly confidential.  We worked shoulder to shoulder with people that had lost their homes and kept soldiering on with much professionalism.  It is a highly emotionally charged and very noisy atmosphere.  It didn’t help that we were not in our normal EOC and guests in the Firehall.  Hotbunking was normal as was sleeping on the couch.  We had half our normal physical space and very poor ventilation as it wasn't designed for that many people in it.

We were able to stand down when the cellular networks were stabilized for about 18 hours.

We adjourned to the Scott’s home for a debrief meal and meeting to discuss lessons learned

I’ll summarize it by saying that we don’t need no stinkin’ Field Day – we ARE prepared.  And I’m damn proud of the entire team of 50 amateurs.  Of course if I did file a contest entry, representative of the number of control stations.  We’d probably win the contest for the sheer amount of traffic passed as well as running on emergency power and interactions with government agencies!

So hams out there I ask as respectfully as I can as a person who has very little idea about what you do,talking with other hams across the globe, helping emergency broadcasts and public service? If so I completely understand but I must admit at the same time I'm slightly let down. I thought you would be able to broadcast a signal in a very small band much like a legalized pirate radio, but I've seen no posts about this.

- Upgrade to extra.  This won't require much

- Improve my CW copying to the point where I can copy faster than I can send.  I've had a few CW elmers tell me that I'll eventually hit a plateau of sorts and I'll be able to copy much faster than I can send.  I can currently send @ 18wpm somewhat consistently

- Attend a Field Day, and maybe even KF7IYQ.  I've only been licensed for two Field Days and I've had a wedding to attend both weekends.  My calendar is clear so far this year...  Otherwise, I may my nice canopy in my back yard, string up a dipole and operate with my KX3 from my deep cycle marine battery all weekend.  

- Achieve an award of some sort.  Likely WAS followed by DXCC.  I have many confirmations for WAS already, I could pull it off in 2013.  I also think I can achieve shack sloth status for SOTA.  I do enjoy chasing!

- More antennas in the air.  I'm a bit weak in the E/W department

- Complete a SOTA activation with my KX3.  The KX3's purchase was primarily driven to operate portable, but they'd still be fun and it'd get my feet wet.

- Obtain a bug.  I have a straight key I really enjoy (though I would like a Navy Flame Proof)

- Finally make that satellite contact.  I just ordered a Baofeng UV-5RE

So that's what I've come up with for now.  Last year seemed to be a lot of kit building and finding out where I want to go in the hobby.  This year feels a lot like I know where I want to go

Have a good holiday and new year everyone!  My wife's pregnant with twins and due by the end of January.  So I'll likely be going dark for quite some time.  This will definitely give me a late start on my goals but who knows

* What time will the balloon be launched
* Where is the balloon projected to land?
* What is the weight of the payload?
* Do you fall under F.A.R. 101?

Even though this balloon did not fall under F.A.R. 101, because of how simple it was to file the NOTAM (Notice to Airmen), even though the provision covering weather balloons did not extend to balloons that have as light of payloads as mine (under 6 pounds).

Not everything went perfect though.  Sadly the radio I was using for APRS continued to use digipeaters even at a high altitude, but it might just do the trick.

I've always been interested in ham radio.  I finally decided to start studying for my Technician Class license last week.  I am using the ARRL Ham Radio License Manual as well as some online resources.  I must admit, VHF, etc.  I am not sure why, but getting an official call sign just seems cool to me.  Oh, and the equipment, from what I have been researching is fascinating to me.   Radios, building a DYI antenna

From the forums, the ham community in general seems like an awesome group of folks.  Very friendly, helpful, and supportive.  A long while ago, I worked with a ham and I remember him as one of the coolest people I know.  I've since lost touch with him.

So I was telling a buddy of mine about my interest in ham radio and that I was studying to get the Technical license.   He then asked me ""Sounds interesting

After I get the Technician Class license, quite terrible at small talk with strangers.  My biggest worry in the hobby is that after getting into and really enjoying the technical side of things, that the social aspect is not something for me. 

Any honest insight folks could share would be greatly appreciated!

I have no complaint with this tactic except that it seems a bit slimy. If W5YI really had good intentions it would have included a paragraph stating that an individual could do the same thing for free by going to the FCC website. Obviously

---------

I remember getting my ham license back in 1992. I was 13 years old, huge antennas, auto-patch systems, and tons more!). It was real ego boost to be able to pick up a ham radio in any given location and make a phone call, talk to emergency personnel, or ask for assistance from a fellow him if your car broke down. There were practical reasons to have a ham radio license and carry a radio.

These days, too. It’s extremely unusual to meet anyone under the age 60. (Interestingly, the same age group that’s been the slowest to adopt the internet).

So what’s the point?  Ham Radio is the Past

There are a number of people out there who really are genuinely interested in RF (Radio Frequency) engineering. You have Ham Radio enthusiasts to thank for nearly every major modern advance in radio and electronics over the last 100 years. For example, cell phones, wireless 3G and 4G, satellite communications, and much, much more all have their roots in ham radio. With very few exceptions, the engineers who are inventing and advancing the world of wireless technologies got their start, from the ham world. If you’re the kind of person who loves to experiment with technology

For those who are genuinely interested in a career (or a hobby) developing new wireless technologies, grow, and innovate. The FCC is very protective of this field (for various reasons), so for the sake of future innovation, ham radio provides a critical bridge between having an interest in the field, and creating new technologies for commercial purposes.

What about Emergency Preparedness?

Emergency preparedness is the other “foot in the door” that continues to provide a lot of attention to the hobby. Unlike nearly all commercial communications systems, 9/11, and the 2003 North American blackout, where normal communications systems were either completely down, or overwhelmed. And it wasn’t just voice and morse code, hams set up wireless computer networks to relay large amounts of information digitally as well. When the grid went down, ham radio took its place.

Unfortunately

In 1993, the vast majority of people passing their entry-level ham test are joining for the same (wrong) reasons, and like their predecessors from nearly 20 years ago, it isn’t taking long before they realize they’re in over their heads and they go back to focusing on their real hobby (emergency preparedness).

It’s a little like buying yourself a shiny new jet with the intent to eventually become a pilot. The airplane looks pretty impressive sitting in your driveway, you realize that you’re actually not that interested in the science of aviation, you’re going to get bored long before you ever learn to fly your new jet.

I mention this only to acknowledge that, and not those who have a license and a radio tucked away in a box. I would argue that, for those who are not sincerely interested in the technical side of the hobby, there are likely no benefits related to emergency preparedness.

Regardless, sleep, and breathe ingenuity to come up with a solution.

Conclusion

Are there any other practical uses for ham radio in the 21st century? Given the massive proliferation of the internet and cell phones of this day and age, they do it because the mountain presents a challenge. A NASCAR driver has but one purpose in a race: To prove that his skills and the engineering abilities of his team are superior. Ham radio operators will tell you that the accomplishments of making an “over the air” contact are a direct reflection of their own engineering prowess, and the next challenge always awaits. “Can I do it again with less power? A smaller antenna?”.

It’s sad that the ham community, computers, the internet, cell phones). For the sake of the future of American innovation, I sincerely hope we can figure out a way to make sure the message is understood: Ham radio is simply a great way to challenge yourself with state of the art science and communications technology. It is generally nothing more, and it is definitely nothing less.

I think it would also be great to help newer General class licensees get started and make contacts.  One of my most enjoyable contacts was actually prearranged online here.  What do you guys think?  Once we have a few

**EDIT**:  Ok

40 meters: (preferred)

7.207.50 Mhz

20 meters: (secondary when above is congested or noisy)

14.335.50 Mhz

10 meters: (when open &amp; technician class)

28.440 Mhz

Rationale:  The first two are within the General-class license area.  Both are also viewable with [this](http://w4ax.com/index.html) web SDR in case you want to monitor the frequencies via a waterfall display. (He is in Atlanta though).  Im a little concerned about the 20 meter selection as I dont want to interfere with SSTV broadcasts, fits not only within General, but also Technician SSB.  I agree with TrouserPudding on the 80 meter issue, so let's leave that to the standard Reddit net.

We welcome more comments.  Ill check again later tonight and pitch it to the mods if this seems favorable to everyone.

I'm in Chicago right now for the summer, I hear you saying it: ""Don't let 2m HT operations get you down. Go find the fun in HF!""

Problem is I can't find a radio in my budget. It seems like everyone I've found selling a radio - especially locally - is retired and won't accept anything less than MSRP for their 5-10 year old used radio. Why are resale values on HF-band radios so unrealistically high? I literally had someone tell me today that he couldn't part with his radio for anything other than just under retail price because he was on social security and living on savings. Not exactly reassuring. Granted I've been looking for HF/VHF/UHF from the last 10 years

Please convince me that this isn't the complete reality of ham operations. I know it isn't! The hams I've met at school and at work are just as down-to-earth and realistic as they are passionate about the hobby. What's a guy to do?

Out comes the Grundig portable radio and a tour of the likely suspect: the power lines. Oddly they were quiet

Inside the house the noise picked up everytime I came near an electrical outlet. Next step was to start isolating circuits by switching them off and on.

But then

The clue was the answerer. It blinked the number of messages in sync with the noise pulses. How could a low power device be doing that?

Aaaha...In the same power strip there was a lamp whose plug wasn't quite in the socket. There it was: a loose connection adjacent to a transformer/rectifier that was drawing current in a rhythmical fashion.

Problem solved simply be firmly plugging in the lamp.

It had the same 'presence' as tinnitus, and was randomly alternating between two tones...like someone twiddling their fingers randomly between two keys on a electric keyboard.  It does this three to five times per second.

Since then I've noted a few more things.

1 - it comes and goes (same as tinnitus

2 - it always has the same two pitches

3 - it seems to be louder in portions of the home (which could be quieter

Two weeks ago it was quite loud in my ear while I was in my basement, and I listened to it for about five minutes (in my head).  It just kept on.

Anyway, rekindled a long standing interest in ham radio.  I've been studying and tinkering, and something told me to go grab an old CB my wife bough for me 15 years ago that was still in the original box (Cobra 19 Ultra^II and a weird window antenna).  So I hook it up to a booster battery that I have and start surfing through the channels. 

When I got to channel 34, and all of the surrounding stations are completely quiet.   I visited it the following day, still there.

Tonight, different rooms, nothing.  Writing it off as temperamental, I fired up the CB to record a small sample to see if anyone might be able to identify it.  Of course, the sound is gone.   (Mostly, you can hear faint clicks of the same cadence, but no tones)

* Broadcasts cause the air circulation fan on my furnace to shut down
* The central vacuum will come on at random times when he is on
* Lights are slightly flickering

* http://youtu.be/8saBvirh58g - Broadcast being picked up by alarm system and coming out smoke detectors

So the main thing I am really worried about is our furnace as it can't be good for it to repetitively fire like it is.  What essentially is happening the exhaust fan comes on, waits for a minute or two then tries the whole process again.  The alarm system is also distressing because I feel that I am going to have to take it offline until he moves the tower and that bothers me for obvious reasons.

**TLDR**: Neighbour is a amateur radio operator and his broadcasts are messing with my furnace, central vac and power.  I am looking for operators who have solved these issues in their own homes.

My big question is about enjoying amateur radio as a hobby. I've met the local club members, and helpful people, but I feel like I'm missing out on something. I'll acknowledge a massive age gap against the average operator as I'm 24, and I'm sure that there is a bit of lacking common ground. Another bit of trouble I've noticed is that a lot of conversations I stumble on while going through the nearby repeaters are just about what kind of new gear people have gotten and how much better things sound or how much farther they go. I guess it's a bit analogous to a video gaming club where all people talk about is their custom-built PCs rather than video games. It's a bit hard to wrap my head around it at times, especially since I'm not yet well-versed in digital, can barely do some CW, not licensed or equipped for DX

I acknowledge that this may or may not be representative of the worldwide amateur radio community, I feel that I'm missing out on some community-based aspect of it.

&gt; The Internet Archive is a 501(c)(3) non-profit that was founded to build an Internet library. Its purposes include offering permanent access for researchers, people with disabilities, and the general public to historical collections that exist in digital format. Founded in 1996 and located in San Francisco, the Archive has been receiving data donations from Alexa Internet and others. In late 1999, the organization started to grow to include more well-rounded collections. Now the Internet Archive includes texts, audio, moving images, and provides specialized services for adaptive reading and information access for the blind and other persons with disabilities. 

This morning he was Twittering about needing some help archiving some old Ham Radio magazines.  I figure we could crowd source some talent here and all reap the benefits of having a nice archive of a really cool magazine with some great content!  

So here are the instructions from Jason...

&gt; I figure it's best to assign a person a year at a time (12 issues)

&gt; The main collection url is [http://www.archive.org/details/ham-radio-magazine](http://www.archive.org/details/ham-radio-magazine) and the template for what I've typed in is at: [http://www.archive.org/details/1968-12-hamradiomag](http://www.archive.org/details/1968-12-hamradiomag)

&gt; As you can see, author and getting stuff in general order as best I could.

&gt; All I'd need is a textfile or e-mail from you with the title, then the next one. I'll do the rest of the work of getting it into the site.

With that said - anyone up for the task?  You can browse through and find a year

Please comment if you're going to claim a year

Here are some things I have learned about it thus far:

Pros:
 * For the coverage and other features
 * Internals are very well constructed.
 * Receive sensitivity is surprisingly good.
 * More compact than an FT-817.

Cons:
 * Audio isn't that great. Turn it up too high and it's very distorted.
 * The ""optimized filters"" ranges are not where they should be.
 * BFO offsets were off by 100hz. Easily changed via settings menu.
 * The supposed CAT control does not work at all.

&gt; Become proficient in CW (aiming for my first CW QSO in the March/April timeframe)

Goal somewhat met.  My copying isn't proficient

&gt; Build a bunch of kits (Softrock, ScQRPion Black Widow Paddle[1] )

Success!  I built a Rockmite40

&gt; Make a CW contact with above built kits

No dice.  Despite building the Rockmite40, and I didn't want to spend money on a tuner.  So I had my fun with the build and sold it to another ham who has made many successful contacts with it.  The Softrock was a fun and lengthy build for me, I took my time with it.  But with the lack of decent SDR applications on OSX and a KX3 coming my way (with I/Q out), I too sold the Softrock.  I built the SOTA tuner (a half wave end fed tuner) and used it for portable CW work with a YouKits HB1A - which have also been sold.

&gt; Portable/QRP operation. Maybe a SOTA[2] activation or two

Success.  [I blogged about it here](http://w2mdw.blogspot.com/2012/07/w2mdwp-activating-lake-nebo.html).  A single contact and he was roughly 20mi away

&gt; Start attending local club meetings. I started off strong when I got licensed last year but quickly faded. Though topics were often a bit stale or the meetings were for voting for various officer positions and such.

Womp womp.  Busy summer with four weddings.   I didn't make a single meeting and I had a wedding on field day.  Though I do keep an eye on meeting schedules and I'll make attempts when I can.

&gt; Make a satellite contact (something that caught my eye to get me into the hobby and then sat on the back burner as I explored the rest of the hobby)

I've done some listening but no successful QSOs.  Though I have a love/hate relationship with VHF/UHF and I don't want to put much money into it as HF has all of my interesting.  So I'd still like to talk through the birds but this has gotten pretty low my list.

Different hams seem to have different ideas of what Field Day is about.  Some see the event as primarily a contest, with emergency power, and show that the can make things work in an emergency.  Still others focus primarily on the event as a public outreach, and almost everyone wants to just get out and have a good time.

Unfortunately the different ideas that different groups have about what Field Day should be sometimes cause friction.  A contester may become frustrated that others don't want to operate all night, say an emergency guy, may not care about any of that - he's as happy with 50 contacts as he is with 500, because he's shown that he can do what he needs to do in an emergency.  He may not see any need to make himself uncomfortable by operating into the wee hours.  He may feel annoyed by the complaints of the contesters who want him to do a bunch of things he doesn't think are valuable or fun.

Hey all. It's been an exhausting week... It's about 1 AM

So I started stuffing [the board](http://i.imgur.com/TvOpY.jpg) exactly one week ago. Solder paste and hot air pencils are the way to go, but I was confident there were no shorts. Plug it in, and get magic smoke. FPGA was rotated 90 degrees.

Replaced it with a new Spartan 6

Next down was the FTDI chip to handle communications between the FPGA and the Computer. I sent 0x00 to 0xff to the computer to make sure it was working, and then it would jump to 0xC0 and repeat three times.

Turns out there was a bridge between data[7] and data[6], however, I remembered my ADC was 14-bit, so I'd need two clock cycles on the 8-bit bus (now 7-bit) to transfer the data across. Come to think of it... nothing's changed really. Except I don't trust that bank on my FPGA anymore...

Today I slapped down the ADC. This part was perhaps the trickiest

My surface mount skills had significantly improved however

Anywho. The next big test is to hook it up to the antenna at my university's ham radio shack

1322737864.0,mw0xd,Looking for a LF Through-the-earth transceiver (cave radio),dgriffith,21,1,17,"Greetings all

I work in an underground mine in the comms section. We have a couple of means of communication - a leaky feeder VHF system and a VLF system running at 376Hz (""PED""). The leaky only works if you can see the cabling, very slow, and depends on a 15km loop antenna run through the mine that might not survive any serious catastrophe. There's no guarantee that the leaky feeder system would still be in one piece after an accident either - if personnel are trapped in an area, it's quite likely the feeder cable would have been damaged as well.

So I'm looking for a pair of LF cave radios for TTE testing for emergency use. Distance between units only has to be a few hundred metres. I've seen info on the ""HeyPhone"" and ""Nicola System"" units that run at about 87-100kHz, none of them seem to be available anymore.

Although my antenna is not anything like world class, maybe even a bit more so.

These low power rigs can be had pretty cheaply. A tricked out FT-817 can be had for &lt;$500. In my case way less than $500. Icom and TenTec also have made some great low power HF rigs but the model names escape me right now.

The point is, and have fun!

Are there drawbacks to QRP? Sure! Do I feel a lot more pumped talking to Brazil with 5watts instead of my usual 100? You bet.

This past week, and he indicated that there was worry that the SCIFs could not get their acceptance with nearby antennas. It was all a matter of perception.

Today I met with the security officer. She had previously requested information (twice, and the majority of them are tube radios. I also told her exactly what bands we could operate (which is nothing above 70cm and nothing below 80m). She did ask what the 'V' and 'U' stood for in ""VHF"" and ""UHF"", respectively. I offered to take her over to the club room so she could see for herself. She said she would want to do that at some point soon, but really to verify that people with binoculars can't seen into the building. 

It sounds like they will reconsider kicking us off the roof. The non-technical people will have to be convinced that these antennas would not jeopardize the security

Apparently mentioning the new antenna part wasn't so hot. That seemed to worry him

Alright

The antennas (notably the large tri-bander on a 10' tower section) have to come down. No questions. Apparently the dean has ordered this, but we were still able to do some good work.

So what's all this about anyways? The building next door, is only accessible by club members, and can only be operated by licensed radio operators. If it really is a security issue, and not just a matter of perception...are they really scared our Heathkit AM/SSB tube twins and Kenwood TS-450S are going to receive top secret encrypted communication links? And so far, we've had zero complaints of harmful interference, but I could still see that as a more valid concern.

I want to get into HAM radios, I really do but honestly it seems like there just isn't any interest in it around my community.

I finally found it

I remember playing around with a friends radios years ago when I first got into it and always liking the ones you needed to know something about to operate rather than the button pusher ones.  I spend my day dealing with computers....while I absolutely will end up with something more modern (and likely an SDR) at some point I really want a classic proper HF rig like this one.  Something that is the complete opposite of my VX-8.

Now I need to figure out what I'm going to do about an antenna and whether I'm going to need a tuner or not.  I've got plenty of trees and a big yard

Criticisms are also welcome.  I know I could just go buy a new rig.  I know I should have thought more about my antenna first.  I'm concerned I'll be out trying to find an antenna tuner before I can get on the air......

But whatever. It will all work out eventually

As far as things useful for HF, a bunch of cable ends, some jumpers and......a call sign.  Time to figure the rest out.

You can also visit the User Input tab on our website to input data points you've received and help us track the balloon.

In the event of communication loss from our Ground Control station

We expect to launch PBH-18 (call sign N2XE) within the next two weeks. I will post updated information here in r/amateurradio with explicit date and time information as we are more sure of our exact launch date.

I'll be specific: I understand that there is a need to zero-beat in order to properly use CW. CW kits such as [this one](http://smallwonderlabs.com/Rockmite.htm) look like an easy way to get on the air (I'm decent with a soldering iron), if at all? Or are these actually only capable of operating on one frequency, and the hope is that everyone's electronics are close enough that it works? Doesn't the restriction to only one frequency severely limit your capability? I'm aware of the availability of used radios, but for the sake of reference, how much should I expect to pay to find a radio that would allow me to transmit using at least SSB and CW on at least one HF band? Other than an antenna and a key/paddle, is there anything else I need?

I appreciate any assistance you can give. I have been scouring the internet over the last few days but all I have found is overpriced gear, and 10/20/40 meters seem like a useful set, but I'm in the middle of a city, so I'd have some trouble with huge antennas.",,False,self,False,t3_uzi0x

   So, I observed multiple people discussing or working on ham radio stuff (6 or 7). In addition, half of them were 18-25 like myself. I think I would have noticed if people had their radios out at a previous SHDH, but this is an anecdote, so take it as you will.
