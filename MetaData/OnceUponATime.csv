So what if the creators intented to have a major Hook storyline all the way up to the finale and couldn't go through with that because the actor became unavailable halfway through shooting this season?

Fifthly, something about ""Neverland."" I think this is the writers' way at hinting at the fact that he's not from FTL, but from Wonderland!

It would also make sense for him to be the White Rabbit. In *Alice in Wonderland*, August and Neal. Are either of them well-adjusted adults? No, not particularly. They never learned the skills necessary for survival.

One thing that dissuades me from this theory is the fact of his age... He doesn't look much older than 30, because he was affected by the curse even if he wasn't trapped in Storybrooke?

It's clear that he knows about magic. The look on his face and the hesitation when August asked him about it. The fact that whatever was in the box convinces him. Now I just want him to fight to get Emma back

1367232669.0,1dbwzx,[Spoilers] Even more Tamara &amp; Greg theories herewithin,muppetsrawesome,48,6,12,"After watching last night's episode

Here's what we know - Tamara is not magical the producers flat out told us

What they fail to tell us is if she's a literary character or not. 

A while back I posted some Fan Fiction that Tamara is descended from the Van Helsing family. Van Helsing's are a Catholic family who consider magic to be unholy and have chased after Dr. Jeckyll, and the like. 

With Dr. Whale/Frankenstein from a universe that is not Storybrooke, or Earth we have a link to that realm. We also know that Frankenstein has a bigger role to play in the Finale from several spoilers released. 

My theory is that Tamara is/or works for the Van Helsing family. Similar to Grimm's but allow us a family of monster hunters without touching on their turf. I say they recruited Greg Mendell - him and his father being a shout out to Tron (Produced by Kitsis/Horowitz) as well. 

Here is several more connections to prove it's not as far fetched as it sound:

Disney own's Marvel which has Rachel &amp; Abraham Van Helsing as character's in their comic books. No where in any story are the Van Helsing family consider magical

Secondly in the world of Horror literature Tamara Thorne is a famous author. She won the Bram Stoker award for her first novel. 

I think and I would argue that Kitsis/Horowitz gave a nod to Tamara and created Tamara

1) Charming: I was sure that there was something significant to us not knowing Charming's real name. Remember waaay back, they got the info, and then started to walk away. When Rumple asked about the name, Charming wouldn't tell him (""It's a boy""), but Snow did. I was sure, absolutely positive, that Snow had no choice but to tell him because Rumple knew her (Snow's) name, since Rumple didn't know his real name. Something similar came up early this season (I don't recall the details) when Rumple and Charming agreed to stay out of each other's way and not interfere with each other. Again

(Side note: I'm kind of annoyed that they haven't done much with the whole ""names give him power"" thing)

2) I thought Charming was King Arthur. Didn't have a lot to back it up

3) Before we knew that a) Tamara was ""her"" and that b) Greg and ""her"" are bad guys, but not in Storybrook, right around the time the curse went into effect. (How she didn't end up in Storybrook, I don't know...magic, I guess). Anyway, she was adopted or whatever, and had spent her whole life trying to convince people (adoptive parents, etc) that she was from another, one day, really hoping that Greg would not turn out to be the bad guy that he clearly is.

4) I was also sure that Greg Mendel was a scientist and was going to help somehow with growing the beans. To be fair

She was born of a common family, in the Brothers Grimm version he just gets mad and leaves.

Really, I think the writers would be able to introduce this fairytale to the story without making it sound too contrived. Additionally, Rumple doesn't often offer free help, but he would want to help banish Cora if she had somehow tricked Rumple into getting Regina back. I've heard people argue that he wanted to help Regina so that she could become the powerful one, but if that was the plan it didn't work out too well in his favor.

The Queen of Hearts argument makes sense, I'm sure he could pop back and forth between realms somehow. The woman in the Rumple story ends up marrying the king and becoming queen, maybe something happened and she lost power. One of the arguments against the QoH theory is how she conducts herself, but maybe since she somehow fell out of power she NEEDED to change her behavior in order to weasel her way back into power.

We know Mr. Gold got Henry for Regina. Mr. Gold knew where Henry was most likely because he was given Emma's name by Snow and was able to track both Henry and Emma at that point.

It was made pretty clear that little is known about outside of Storybrooke by any of the other characters. August Booth came into Storybrooke and absolutely no one knew who he was. So because of this I am going to assume that no one

**Now on to where everything is completely my own theory**

The writers of this show **love** connecting things together. They especially love connecting things together that we know little about. Who do we know least about then?

I would have to say the first person in this list would be Emma. We know almost nothing about her past in our world. Then after that would be Henry. We do not have a clue where he was born

[We know that Mr. Gold's son is outside of the curse so it would be pretty safe to assume that he does not live in Storybrooke. Mr. Gold's son seemed like a very nice boy before he went through the portal into our world; however, mean, ect.] (/spoiler) From what we know who does that sound like? Henry's birthfather who Emma does not even want to talk about.

Now I could be wrong
**I don't believe the authors would just pick a random person to be Henry's birthfather.**
Who came into this world and was outside this curse when Henry was conceived? [Emma
The writers need a way to connect and introduce Mr. Gold's son into everything

Well that was long and poorly written

I'm proposing to my girlfriend, my chest is getting heavy and my stomach is already filled with steel-winged butterflies. Anyone who's gone through this can attest, it's nerve wracking even in the weeks beforehand. I'm sorry for rambling, but I just needed to say how I'm feeling as I type this out. 

We're massive fans of the show. And, which has now turned to just ""Her Charming"". She's my Snow; She's beautiful, courageous, sweet, always trying to do the right thing, and all around the one for me. We've been together for 5 years (since I was in a Senior in highschool, her a junior.) It's really time, for thise proposal.

**All** of that being said, words of encouragement, something extra to show her I'll always do what I can to pull off something amazing for her. Now, I know people would say proposing is enough. However, those who have felt this sort of love, and those who are searching for it, know how you always want to do more. That last amazing firework to end the show. 

I want to show her that I can do more than what's expected. And if I can pull off getting a sweet message

Any suggestions? Any advice? Any help that can be offered? I'm just a young man who doesn't know where else to turn for this sort of stunt...

In Once Upon a Time

Regina's mother was Cora

Rumplestiltskin's father was a deserter in the war and Rumple grew up in his shadow.  Baelfire, I'm sure), he eventually became a good man--partly due to the influence of August, who literally had no biological parents, unless you count the Blue Fairy and/or the trees  from which his wood came.

Now let's look at the most main characters.

Snow's mother was a brat when she was a child but eventually grew up to be a better woman.  This is the woman Snow knew, who was vengeful for various reasons and corrupted by magic but did not share a bloodline with her.  This woman also eventually killed Snow's father because a) she wanted more power and b) the king didn't love Regina, he married her simply because she had saved Snow White--Snow White, who truly was the center of his world.

""Prince James""/Prince David was raised by his birth mother and his identical twin brother grew up as a prince because he was adopted into the royal family.  While the brother ended up being corrupted due to power

Emma was born to David and Snow White and escaped the curse.  She grew up in our world's foster care system and became a chaotic neutral character

I sort of covered Baelfire before

And Henry.  Henry, he was adopted by Regina through Gold's influence and eventually realized that Storybrooke existed in a perpetual state of constancy.  At one point he called Regina his ""mommy,"" and he either always was or eventually became isolated and was told he was crazy by his mom who sent him for therapy with Mr. Hopper; Mary Margaret was his teacher and gave him a present in the form of the Once Upon a Time book... That's about it.  

In the series we see him as a non-obedient child towards Regina and more respectful of his biological family.  All the real ""help"" he gets is from his biological family--Mary Margaret, humdrum, somewhat crazy life.  MM gives him the book.  Emma gives him hope that he can have a separate family and a different life.  David eventually takes Henry under his wing and becomes a protector.  Even Neal is becoming something of a more parental figure.  

And Rumplestiltskin is becoming more sympathetic and a more ""protected"" figure simply because he's Henry's grandfather--biologically. 

**EDITED TO ADD:**

**TL;DR**: This series seems to be saying ""blood is thicker than water,"" especially for Henry.

- Rumple blasting fairy god mother into oblivion and stealing her wand. He paid no price.
- Rumple, throwing people out of the way, etc. They are all done at no ""price"" even though they're all individual acts of magic. We could debate the ""scale"" of magic; but at the same time the energy created to be released by a giant ball of fire in itself should be comparable to a large scale spell as well.  Again, no cost.
- Spinning straw into Gold requires only ""emotions""
- True Love's Kiss pretty much plays this to the extreme. It can break any curse at no cost.
- Using Mad Hatter's Hat to travel. In FTL
- Ripping hearts out.
- Using water from lake nostro
- Regina brewing a sleeping potion. You could say that the ingredients were a ""price""
- In fact
- Regina's price tends to be the disaffection of Henry
- Using magic beans to travel. The bean itself is the magic

Then we look at what does come at a price:

- Any ""good"" character wanting to use magic to solve a problem. Especially when they consult Rumple.
- Making or breaking deals with Rumple.
- Regina using/needing hearts as part of a spell
- Cora's Candle. But remember


What I'm suggesting is that Magic doesn't really come at a price... but rather, a fear mongering, scare tactic to prevent every character from running directly to using magic at the first sign of trouble. When the magic is neutral or beneficial to him, he doesn't collect a price (Emma using HIS invisible chalk to cast a barrier spell) but when it comes to something that involves his plans, he collects heavily (Snow and Charming's hair for love potion for the most molecular favors)

we already saw that snow is not so pure. i think she, at the end of ""the queen is dead"" she outright said that she was going to kill cora. in ""the miller's daughter"", snow is on the phone with charming, and she's holding an apple looking quite distraught. she and henry were both poisoned with apples. i think she was already contemplating cora's murder. i think that is why her heart has a spot. she wasn't killing out of defense, it was out of vengeance for her mother. she lured regina with the hope of her mother's love. **love.** the one thing she's always fought for and the one thing she knows regina is desperate for. she didn't just take out an enemy in battle, she was manipulative and malicious. the murder was premeditated.

snow is also easily swayed by what she's told. she tends to believe what she hears. regina told her that her heart will become blacker, but i'd like to see her take a darker path to get what she wants. i don't think she would turn all the way around, rather more like some bad means to get to a (presumably) good end.

* King Xavier (Prince Henry's father...so

As for the women:

* We know **Eva** the earliest as a princess

* **Abigail** and Charming were meant to unite King Midas' and King George's kingdoms.

* Cora is the **Queen of Hearts** but that is in another realm/world.

1. Rumpelstiltskin - he provided the candle to Snow, as he was protecting the few people he cared about, but also did it to preserve himself.

2. Snow - She used the candle on Cora's heart, but brought them about by very dark/evil means.

3. Regina - She placed the heart back into her mother, not what her mother wanted.  But she also did it to stop her mother's insatiable quest for power, which she had begun to realize was in nobody's best interest.  Also, she acted rashly - not really thinking through what **could* happen if she put her mother's hear back.

So, since killing Cora would keep the greatest number of people happy and therefore the ends justify the means?

I'm interested in what everyone thinks on this subject.

In episode 19 ""The Return"" August starts poking around Mr. Gold/Rumple's shop. This raised Rumple's suspicion so he began to follow August around town. Rumple tails August to the convent where he sees August talking with Mother Superior/The Blue Fairy. After Snow gave birth earlier than expected the Blue Fairy told Geppetto to allow Snow and infant Emma to go through the wardrobe instead of letting Pinnocchio and Emma go. Because Geppetto decided to ignore the Blue Fairy's orders and go with the original plan and she left to ""make preparations"" with the other fairies she had to assume that Geppetto followed her order and that Snow and Emma went through safely.

**W**hen August comes to visit her in Storybrooke as Mother Superior she wouldn't know who he was

**A**ugust tried to use the dagger on Rumple and of course it did nothing, the way August paused before he said ""Papa"" was as if he KNEW that it would strike a cord with Rumple.

**T**he main thing I can't seem to figure out is how August knew about Baelfire. Baelfire was alive centuries before Pinnochio was even born. The only people, the Blue Fairy...or Baelfire himself. Since we have yet to see (**FOR SURE**) where/when/if Bael is in the current timeline of Storybrooke we can rule him out for the time being. It is obvious Rumple didn't tell August about Baelfire so that leaves only the Blue Fairy. But how could she have told him unless she retained her memories from Fairytale Land somehow?

**J**efferson also retains his memories of Fairytale Land. Recently it has been revealed that Jefferson also has ties to Rumple to at least some degree but it is unlikely Rumple would have divulged the story of Baelfire to Jefferson.

**T**his means that either the above theory about the Blue Fairy retaining her memories is true and she is plotting against Rumple with the help of August or August is in communication with Baelfire somehow or was at some point in the past before he came to Storybrooke. It's also possible that August

**Some Things I Still Don't Understand**

* The Blue Fairy left with the ""other fairies"" to make ""final preparations"" before the curse hit. What the heck does that mean? Could they be hiding something?

* Before the curse was broken August/Pinnocchio could see himself transforming back to wood. How is this possible if there was no magic there? Perhaps it's because he was originally carved from a magical tree similar to the one that the wardrobe was made out of and he just sort of has residual magic lingering inside him?

* Something about the Blue Fairy just does not sit right with me. I get the feeling that she operates behind the scenes and has her own schemes running. Snow made mention that there are good and bad fairies (""Snow Falls"" I believe) so maybe there is more to the fairies than we've been led to believe. I can't prove anything but I am willing to bet that she is behind some huge things.

**Following questions:** Why was Regina able to use magic after Emma touched her? What was the situation that came before that moment? Then finally why didn't Rumple/Mr. Gold use any magic just yet?

[Hopefully the correct answers](/speculation) Well Regina clearly realized something at the point that Emma touched her that is clear


* Sorry if this is confusing

* At the end of the episode Mr. Gold told Belle that she should leave because he is a monster. Mr. Gold still loves Belle

* Why did Regina's magic start wearing off once Henry walked in? Because Regina's only love in the world is Henry and if Henry loves her she has magic if Henry doesn't then Regina is heart broken and cannot perform any spells.

I like to do screencaps as a fun way to rewatch the show and pay attention to the details presented on screen. Sometimes one can find things that have meaning within the story

I know y'all like easter eggs and I spotted what I think are a couple of Disney references and a number of objects that exist in both worlds. Some composite pics are linked below

[**You won't like Happy when he's angry**](http://i.imgur.com/74PRX.jpg)  
The dwarf's forest home seems nice and cozy

[**Mary Margaret has nice knick knacks**](http://i.imgur.com/kqC8S.jpg)  
When Emma goes back to the apartment to check for signs of forced entry she gives us a tour of the room. Mary Margaret has lots of little statues and stuff on her dresser, lots of songbirds, 5 bell jars, a pic of butterflies (LOST also referenced butterflies), and of course the ol' murder weapon in the air duct.

[**Beware the Magister**](http://i.imgur.com/xFBte.jpg)  
The word ""MAGISTER"" is engraved above the door to the mayor's office. And that heart box on her desk is staring right at me. That box was last seen in FTL during the ceremony that invoked the curse (ep 102).

The Queen likes to ride horses, Master of the Horse](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_of_the_Horse). Another possible connection is to a [Dungeons &amp; Dragons book](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Magister) about creating magical items. Also, the word Magistrate derives from the Middle English word magistrat, denoting a ""civil officer in charge of administrating laws"" (c.1374); from the Old French magistrat; from the Latin magistratus, which derives from magister (master), from the root of magnus (great). Sooooo, she's got *that* going for her.

[**Guard Guard Bear**](http://i.imgur.com/mC6V3.jpg)  
Charming picked a bad day to wear his cape with the bear fur collar. There is something in each corner of this relatively empty room

[**Henry has the key**](http://i.imgur.com/v5g1q.jpg)  
I enjoyed August's talk with Henry about how ""you and I have faith

[**Shooting the Queen**](http://i.imgur.com/5kYLO.jpg)  
No particular objects discovered here, lots of extras, snow falling just right, banners flying, dolly shots, guards, carriage

[**Just taking inventory**](http://i.imgur.com/lEFHw.jpg)  
That's what Mr. Gold says to Emma when she comes to ask him for help. Ok then, an accordian, a wooden steering wheel from an old timey sailing ship, don't know what those are for but, check, check and check. A magnifying glass as seen in the show's opening credits and also in the here and now as we transition to FTL where Rumple, reknowned as the most powerful man in the world, not available in stores btw

[**Rings and things**](http://i.imgur.com/R7YIP.jpg)  
But what's that globe-like thing in the middle of the room? Glad you asked, and later when she was peeling an apple with a knife (when David stopped by her office) we got a good look at Regina's ring. Finally, when Mr. Gold is telling Emma that she is more powerful than she can possibly imagine, it is while Emma is leaning forward and the ring on her necklace is dangling there like a hypnotist's watch.

Oh yeah

&gt; Usually a ball representing the Earth or, the armillary sphere was the prime instrument of all astronomers in determining celestial positions.

An Armillary Sphere is useful for learning one's position in the world. But instead of having an Earth or Sun in the middle this one has a clock. What's with the clocks in this show?!? That is unusual for an Armillary Sphere. I looked through google images and did not see one Armillary Sphere with a clock in the center. So I think this one is unique and something Mr. Gold is making or repairing. Working theory: Gold is using it to try to physically find a way back to FTL

If Bae was 14 before leaving Fairytale land (the [wiki](http://onceuponatime.wikia.com/wiki/Baelfire) mentions Bae was fourteen for the Ogre Wars), like Emma). Yet if Neal (Henry's dad) and Bae are the same person then that wouldn't make sense since Emma and Neal were a lot closer in age when they met (about 6-7 years based on the [wiki page](http://onceuponatime.wikia.com/wiki/Neal_Cassidy)).

So if this is the case
that's unaccounted for. I can't really think of a scenario where Bae goes from being 14 years older than Emma to 7 years older than Emma. He wasn't affected by the curse because he was outside of FTL and even if he was

So then that means that Neal isn't Bae. And yet all the signs seem to be pointing to those two being one in the same

The only way it works is if Neal didn't go to our world and was instead in another world without magic for ~14 years, and time stood still in New York. But again, that doesn't really make any sense. So that would mean that Neal isn't ACTUALLY in New York, but some place similar that is close to New York since that's where the globe pointed Bae to be.

I'm getting a little lost in my own thought here, which would be interesting. If he was in Neverland for ~14 years dealing with Hook then that could tie into the story VERY well. But that would mean that Bae had to have been affected by the curse, so when he met Emma he never actually aged.

A huge blow to Rumpelstiltskin is if Bae is not even in the Storybroke realm at all, but in another, such as the world Frankenstein lives in (which also doesn't have magic) I'm just thinking Bae will be in like his forties and will be shown by the end of the season.

1324106170.0,ng5aq,"The Queen, Henry Mills, and Rumplestiltskin [Spoilers through 1.07]",queenbeetle,17,15

In the mausoleum the camera focused on Regina's family name, where the miller tells the king that his daughter can spin straw into gold. The king locks up the daughter and demands that she produce gold. Rumple shows up and bargains with the daughter, in exchange for spinning the gold, eventually receiving her promise of her first born. The king marries the miller’s daughter. When their daughter is born, Rumple shows up and demands his payment. The queen begs him, and he finally agrees that if she can guess his name, she can keep her daughter. One of the queen’s men is able to spy on Rumple and discover his name. When the queen reveals it

What if: 

1.	The queen/Regina is the miller’s daughter
2.	The king in the story of Rumplestiltskin is Midas
3.	Their daughter is Abigail

Midas is obsessed with gold. He hears of this girl who can spin straw into gold and kidnaps her. Rumple comes in and does his thing. The miller’s daughter (evil queen) makes the original bargain with him but messes up with the second bargain. Maybe she wasn’t supposed to cheat on finding out his name. Whatever it is maybe she has to leave Midas and Abigail behind

Am I rambling? Does this make any sense? Does anyone else think the CGI is atrocious? :) Seriously interested in further thoughts…

But say she is pulling the strings - what if her motives are still good?

We already know she predates Rumple; what if she were there when the first Dark One came into being?  

It could have been intentional by some third party

It could have been accidental, or the Blue Fairy herself.  ""Let's do X to make the world a better place... OH NO! IT BACKFIRED, AND I'VE TURNED THAT POOR SCHMUCK A TWISTED SOUL WITH IMMENSE POWER IN DARK MAGIC!""

It could have been the law of unintended consequence of some act by a third party, WE JUST TURNED THAT POOR SCHMUCK INTO A TWISTED SOUL WITH IMMENSE POWER IN DARK MAGIC!""

The first two could also open the possibility that the creation of the Dark One corrupted a world that had been pure &amp; good before the creation of the first Dark One.

So what if she is pulling the strings

We could already say she made one attempt at this

Hmm... one other idle thought for a possible theory.  What if, and influences the actions of its host to ensure its own survival?  What if the ultimate struggle ends up being against not the Dark One or any other Big Bad, but the Dark One's power itself?

edit: Or what if said Power of the Dark One is looking to extend its influence over all worlds?

All that could have been achieved with the simplest of meetings between Snow/David instead of all this complex kingdom-level scheming.

Finally, Neil was brought back.  And to do so, he was knocked out before he was taken &amp; deposited outside of town when he woke up by Jefferson.  There was no ""town line curse"" then, so Jefferson would have been able to do so.  Or then again, he may not have knocked him out - just gotten him out of there before anyone knew Jefferson had brought him back.

I'm using this thread to move all of the season 1 discussions into a single post so they can make room for season 2 discussions.

I'll also take this time to restate the spoiler policy in a couple bullet points

* Mark posts that contain spoilers by including [Spoilers] within the title of the post.
* Mark posts that contain speculation by including [Speculation] within the title of your post.
* Do not include spoilers of either kind within the title of your post.

I want to reiterate, in the S2E1 discussion thread, you wouldn't need to black out your text if you are discussing what happened in the episode. If you are mentioning the previews for the next episode though, you WOULD be required to mark that as spoilertext.

If you see a comment or post not following the rules

The Season 2 Episode 1 discussion thread will be created around 5pm PST today.

as for the episode itself, instead of the usual of showcasing one character in both worlds.

and seeing the Huntsman again was fantastic! i was hoping we'd see him again sometime soon in FTL

as for everyone's motives and what their plans were, Jefferson just wants revenge on Regina now, and he knows that Rumpel is the man to do it. but i'm sure he wasn't expecting Rumpel to turn the tables and bring magic to land, which as we all saw made Regina very happy. so in a way, this kind of backfired, but we'll have to see how this coming 'war' between Rumpel and Regina comes to in the second season, and i hope Jefferson gets a bigger role in it

as for Rumpelstiltskin, him saying that magic is power questions his motive, but i still think he's just searching for Bae now cause why would they give us those character-driven episodes? these writers, of all people, know that they aired them with meaning.

i think he just believes if he has magic and power, and brought the curse to travel to Storybrooke and break it himself(through manipulating Emma) to get out of it.

like i said, and the writers better think of something creative for Emma and Henry cause right now, in the scheme of things we're given, they're kind of useless now in a land full of magic.",,False,self,False,t3_tm1gy

Is anyone else incredibly pissed about how Regina's life seems to keep ending up? And how it's pretty much always Rumple doing some s**t in the background? (Although I suppose that last bit is true for pretty much everyone.)

How I see it: She falls in love with a man who is killed before her by her own mother, even if naively, also responsible for Daniel's death), then after some all out chaos between her and the other characters of FTL (that we haven't really seen) she is captured by Snow and Charming. They go to execute her and, funnily enough (/sarcasm), when she gives that lecture and Snow ""spares"" her Rumple is in the audience looking right at her. I can't help wonder if he *does* something to her at that time to make her... more angry than her base angry self. Then Rumple just gives Snow and Charming a way to ""test"" if Regina can ever have a normal life/recover/whatever. A test? FROM RUMPLE?! ARE YOU PEOPLE STUPID? Just knowing the source of the test I give it no credit. Maybe she would have stabbed Snow, maybe the knife was f'ing spelled. My point is that you can't know one way or the other because the source is too manipulative to make it a trustworthy test.

Then of course after they are in ""the real world"", all the lovely illnesses that come with childhood, school plays/functions, etc.). She also would not even recognize him if he walked by her on the street except he told her exactly who he was. Until then? Nada. Also, it seems to me that Emma parents very similarly to S1 Regina, which makes me very infuriated when it seems like the other characters think Emma is some kind of wonder-mom and Regina is a failure of a parent. The kid is a good kid. Good kids don't tend to come from broken homes (although it's not impossible, granted). Give the woman some god damned credit. Aside from the fact that Emma takes Henry AWAY from Regina, and she has to literally beg for time with HER OWN KID. On top of that

Then Regina is accused of killing Archie and Emma's ""supersense"" says she's innocent. Until, Rumple's test shows that she is guilty when she isn't. Huh. Imagine that, Rumple's test isn't infallible and points the finger at exactly who he wants blamed for something. Never would have seen that coming. And Emma is so great at casting magic that clearly she would be able to prevent any tampering from him or see the truth of the matter. But yea, let's ignore the never-wrong supersense instead. ACK.  And then Snow in this latest episode: the epitome of good right? ""You should help your mother because then you could be a family for Henry"" while Snow KILLS HER MOTHER. I don't really care how guilty Snow feels, that was some special level of manipulation right there. It's quite a bit worse than ""oops, wayward spell/arrow/whatever"".

Just. GAH. GAH. Maybe Regina's actions are overkill and maybe they aren't, perhaps a bit more badass and black/white over there - but ignoring that they seem really similar. IMO, of course.

PS And now I even feel badly for Cora after this last episode. I mean good god man. That last scene was awful for my emotions :(

Emma woke Henry when he was in the hospital because of their true love

Which makes me wonder, what?, becomes a loner?

Henry is an important thread because he ties the good and evil together in the story so far. And while I thought Regina could maybe fill a void left by Henry with the love of her mother (before Cora died), Cora and Henry (yea, right).

And we saw Henry be sympathetic towards Regina as his mother when she was trying to be good but what was their relationship like before Emma was in their lives? Before he was suspicious? Does he really love her

Regina could let go of Daniel because he was just gone; zombie Daniel was a sad sight to her, not so much the extended OUAT family tree), she is forever flip-flopping (though she has been denied trust...well, maybe she deserved it) between good and evil, and not only has Henry caused her emotional damage but she might as well assume he doesn't care that Cora died, so not caring that someone else his [adoptive] mother loved died.

Of course we saw Regina's mixed emotions when she realized Cora might not have Regina's and/or Henry's interest as a priority.

And we'll have to see how that plays out. Who can Regina hate anymore? Who can trust her anymore? Maybe this is just how it was when Emma arrived...everyone against Regina

1. Magic returns obviously. But it's unstable. No one can really tap into it to use it. Rumple spends the series trying to stabilise it.
2. Breaking the curse. Everyone remembered who they are after Emma kissed Henry but are still stuck in Storybrooke. I believe that Emma has to find True Love in order to break the curse. I'm guessing one of the male characters will begin to develop a romantic storyline with Emma to build this up be it either Pinocchio or The Mad Hatter Once Emma has true loves kiss with her true love

The curse supposedly affected all the lands

I personally don't see it being very interesting if every new present day character we meet is already aware of who they were in Fairytale Times.

Similar to Snow White and the Evil Queen

With that in mind

Maleficent will be back (in human form) as an additional ""Big Bad."" She will probably want revenge on Regina

We'll probably also learn about the existance of other towns with Fairytale characters midway through Season 2. Because a magical Storybrooke

Each of these new towns will be based on a different kingdom from Fairytale Times with its own mix of dual characters that don't remember anything. This will be used to introduce further big bads and heroes in future seasons.

Emma and August will have to travel to these other towns and ""awaken"" the characters in an effort to recruit them to fight some sort of ""even bigger bad"" -- probably a coalition of big bads that Regina and Mr. Gold will be trying to work with.

One compatible collection of characters would be a seaside area

I think that there could also be a ""Wonderland, etc. lives--though maybe not since the Mad Hatter was in Storybrooke, but I'm sure they could come up with some reason why he could travel.

This way the show can keep its format and formula

Do you think the Regina/Huntsman(Graham) relationship is trivialized as a portrayal of stereotypical male fantasies of domination and seduction (or even an outright joke a la ""Death by snu-snu""). Do you think the writers (or the upcoming comic) will ever try to address this as a celar issue of abuse

Is the Regina/Leopold relationship trivialized by the fact that we are disposed to dislike Regina after being introduced to her later in life as the Evil Queen? Or does her past actually strike a chord with some viewers because as a relatively realistic situation (as opposed to a magical caricature in the Huntsman's case)? 

Or perhaps do you think these stories have already been treated in a respectful manner? How do you think social notions of gender and sexual dynamics affect how these two relationships are perceived (individually and in relation to each other)?

Hopefully one of you can offer a workable solution to this and I've just been missing it. 

Here's the timeline I've got :

1) Cinderella wants to go to the ball. Fairy Godmother shows up
2) Presumably the ball goes well

3) She meets with Rumple because ""twins"" and helps entrap him.

4) Curse yada yada, still pregnant. 


Number 2 is about where my issues start. We see Snow at Cinderella's wedding

We see her again at number 3 where Cinderella is CLEARLY pregnant. Let's do some generous math here: Cinderella could be huge at 6 months and Snow could be tiny at 4 months. We can even go ahead and say that Emma was born early (I think she was?) and give her a whole month for that. Cinderella STILL would have had her baby at least a month before Emma. And I think this math is completely unreasonable as I'm pretty sure Snow/Charming didnt get married until after Rumple was caged. 

The only way I see this working would be if Snow was pregnant at Cinderella's wedding but that wouldnt explain why Cinderella was huge at the Rumple Meeting and Snow wasnt showing at all. Plus it goes against Snows character to be running around kicking ass while knocked up. She would have protected her baby and waited to get pregnant. 

The other option is that Cinderella was pregnant for over a year and closer to two (not counting the whole time she was cursed).

Any suggestions?

Based on the promo we got for ""Selfless, I'm pretty sure (along with the help of one of my friends) that Tamara is Tiger Lily.

It has been confirmed by OUAT producer Jane Espensen that Hook (Colin O'Donoghue) will return in 2x18, next week.  Hook, as we all know, was left in some sort of storage closet by Emma, Snow, Charming, and Rumpel before they took the Jolly Roger back to Storybrooke.  Further, the last two episodes of this season are [Spoiler]""Second Star to the Right, and the like.[/spoiler]  Again,"" for stealing Mila and cutting off his hand.  If Tamara is Tiger Lily

Also, she would have no recollection of magic, seeing as she wasn't transported to Storybrooke with the rest of the Fairytale crew.  However, I have a potential work-around for this. [Spec]Regina's curse transported *people* to Storybrooke and wiped their memories.  Neal/Bae ended up in New York [Spoiler]because of the portal Rumpel created.(/spoiler) However, this *doesn't* explain how the Jolly Roger got to Storybrooke, as we all know it did.  If Hook managed to get his hands on some fairy/Neverland magic to transport himself and his ship, Tamara, would have come from Neverland and had access to the same thing.(/speculation)

This subreddit is meant to be a safe place to talk about the TV series regardless of how many episodes you've seen. **Warnings are required before all spoilers.** Please follow the guidelines below to insure everyone has a good time here and enjoys the TV show to the fullest.

_____
**What is a Spoiler?**

Opinions differ on what exactly is a real spoiler, only to describe what types of spoilers are moderated here.

Spoiler moderation for this subreddit is limited to ""events from the show."" That basically means anything that ""happens"" in the series is spoiler information. Things that simply ""exist"" in some form at the beginning of series are not spoilers

**Not Spoiler | Spoiler**

* Saying a character is a hero/villain/badass/jerk | Describing a character's heroic/evil/awesome/lame deeds

* Saying a character is handsome | Saying a character is now ugly due to an injury during the series

* ""Let's talk about Emma in episode 3"" | [""Let's talk about Emma's death in episode 3""](/spoiler)

* ""I wish Emma would adopt Henry"" | [""Emma adopted Henry!""](/spoiler)

Spoilers need warning. That means don't put spoilers in your post's title. If you're linking to an image, don't post any spoilers. 

The spoiler warning in a post title has scope. For example, but spoiler events from later episodes do need warning tags. A title with only ""spoilers"" may contain information from any episode, including future episodes. Be aware of the warning scope with each post. 

Jokes that pretend to be a spoiler may also require tags if they are explicit enough to be taken seriously by some people. Revealing the joke may result in a reverse-spoiler

____ 


**What is Speculation?**

Speculation spoilers are detailed theories regarding information that has not yet been revealed in the broadcast episodes. Examples of speculation that always needs a speculation warning/tag includes:

* The true secret heritage of any character

* The surprise return of any character thought to be dead for whatever reason.

* The meaning of any prophecies that have not yet been revealed.

Minor speculation may be included under a regular spoiler tag while talking about other event details

When posting speculation-specific threads

**What to do with a Spoiler**

If you encounter a live spoiler without proper warning, or be making a bigger deal out of a mild spoiler. You can post your ""SPOILERS!"" reply using a cover tag to draw less attention to the post, and/or simply report it to the mods for review.

A lot has been revealed this last episode. We can now connect some dots that we couldn't before. I will outline a few of them here. Keep in mind this contains massive amounts of speculation.

As of the episode “The Queen Is Dead” we now know that:

* Neal is Baelfire (""Manhattan"")
* Neal knows who Hook is
* Neal went to at least one other land before ours (most likely Neverland being one)
* Neal can sail a pirate ship

Building from these facts we can try and make some guess about some other mysteries of the show. Particularly surrounding Neal and August.

Firstly we must consider both of these character's lives. Both Neal and August had fathers who loved them tremendously but sacrificed being with them: Rumple for power and Gepetto to help protect Emma and eventually help her break the curse. Both were left to fend for themselves as young boys in a strange land. These events could easily put both of them on a path to become Lost Boys in Neverland.

Baelfire noted that our world was not his first stop so we know he went to another land before ours. Taking into account what he revealed in regards to knowing who Hook was and that he could sail a pirate ship it's also safe to assume he was in with Peter Pan in some fashion, the same Lost Boys remained. Memories of Baelfire intact. 

Early in August's life in our world he was an orphan on his own who was charged with looking after an infant Emma whom he abandoned to leave with a group of other orphans. Where they went has not been revealed but it's no stretch to think that maybe they made their way to Neverland (or at least August did somehow). It's possible that upon arriving in Neverland he joined with the Lost Boys and told them his story. They noted how it was similar to another Lost Boy's story

However

Like most things in OUAT we get some answers which only bring up more questions. Lots of things are still up in the air. To me this brings two storylines together in a very cool way and is by no means a stretch of the imagination. We'll just have to wait for the long overdue August episode to see what they reveal.

As a child I assumed the Aladdin in Disney's ""Aladdin"" was Indian for some reason. The Aladdin story comes from a Middle Eastern set of tales. However

Ethnically Chinese/Far Eastern or just lived there? I am not sure

As for the word Caucasian being used on in other posts concerning Aladdin and actor Michael Raymond-James as Neal Cassady, I guess. Or because it is a Middle Eastern folk tale. But I always think of many Middle Easterners being Caucasian. And if the writers want to switch it up and really hit the source material, Aladdin would be Chinese.

If that were the case

I say source material but, maybe, what was considered ""China"" in the Arabian Nights tales. I first went to the Wikipedia page on the Aladdin story because I had to update myself from my thoughts as a young child that Aladdin was Indian.

Once we get introduced to Jefferson, maze-y throw cushions and painting on the mantle, eggs on mantle reminiscent of Tweedledee and Tweedledum, etc.

[Alice-y items in Jefferson's home](http://i.imgur.com/ppzgm.jpg)

Emma puts it together and realizes he thinks he's the Mad Hatter from Alice in Wonderland. I'm pretty sure Jefferson had already thought of that as he has some Alice illustrations by [John Tenniel](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Tenniel) on his walls.

[hallway pictures

The set up for Jefferson's downfall is heartbreaking and one of many parts that made this a great story.

He can not afford the rabbit toy.
So he makes one.
Grace loves it.
Tea party with stones for scones and buttons for cakes.
He feels guilty and determines to take the job.
He says goodbye and promises to return.

composite 4 - storyboard

Later when we see Grace as Paige with her Storybrooke family we can understand his madness. It was also heartbreaking to see Emma fake believing so she could thunk him with the telescope.

[look through telescope at family Grace is staying with](http://i.imgur.com/vEgdn.jpg)

Once in Wonderland we see what the production team can do with virtual characters and environments. Some said Wonderland looked fake and placticy but I thought it was amazing. How real does a place like Wonderland need to look?

We get a look at the Queen of Hearts vault where Regina finds the heart she was looking for.

Jefferson is captured and brought before the Queen of Hearts. When he tries to make a deal to get back to his daughter the Queen says

[queen's court

Emma and Mary Margaret fight to escape and we see that Jefferson has a scar on his neck. He falls from a fatal height but on the ground there is nothing but hat.

In the end we see Jefferson madly trying to make hats so he can get home. There is some [history to the phrase ""mad as a hatter.""](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mad_hatter)

&gt;  *inspired by the phrase ""as mad as a hatter""

I can imagine a hatter going mad from the mercury fumes, and wondering if a person were very small, what kind of harm one might do. It was a dark episode and a great story. I loved it.

This all happens between above and Snow trying to rescue Charming from Castle (Fairy bombardment!)

That means, takes an arrow, and gets dragged to a dungeon. Rumple impressively managed to creates the dark curse, gets it to Regina, and Regina more impressively trading something to Rumple, trades that curse to Maleficient, and then using H&amp;G to get apple

I know Horowitz and Kitsis were behind Lost

From what I'm seeing now

We have the obvious:

1. Why did August do what he did in the past? Where is he now? What is he doing?
2. What did Neal do after he was abandoned by his father
3. Why does Cora hate Snow's family so much?
4. Will Belle ever get her memories back? Will Greg Mendell become more important to the story?
5. Will Emma ever find out about Regina killing Graham?

To the less obvious/still unanswered/probably forgotten questions/storylines:

1. What happens to Prince Phillip
2. Where is Jefferson/Madhatter? Was he reunited with Grace? Probably. Did we get to see it even though they made us feel for him not being able to see his daughter while everyone was cursed? No. 
3. Where is Smee? Wouldn't he be helping Hook?
4. What happened to King George?
5. Do Nova and Dreamy/Grumpy get to be together now? Are they?
6. Do Abigail and Frederick get together post curse?


Random Questions that possibly only I have:

1. Why isn't Cinderella's Prince helping at all? 
2. If we've seen Dr. Frankenstein

I'm sure there's other unresolved stories that I haven't listed

Isn't this too much? The show is starting to bore me even though I don't want it to do that. I feel like the show is just too busy with all this unresolved stuff. 

My big fear is that the show will get cancelled due to low ratings

1351118350.0,1216c4,[THEORY] All magic comes from fairy dust,gerald_bostock,5,0,8,"Think back to the oldest story we're told about in the series. That is, the Blue Fairy is mentioned as 'the original power'

So far in the series, we've seen the cost. Yet this doesn't seem to be the case in the same way for fairy magic. Of course, there is a cost, and this is the life that the fairy godmothers and dwarfs have to lead, but there's also the fact that fairy dust seems to be pure magic. And this is where my argument comes from.

The theory is that somehow, the blue fairy discovered fairy dust, and since then, magic has made its way into the world through her. Now, I'm not considering things like ogres and stuff magic because that's just their nature, but the ability to actually do magic seems pretty limited. Other than fairy dust, we have never seen an example of pure magic in either world (except for True Love). All the 'good' magic we've seen, comes from the fairies.

And the 'bad' magic doesn't appear out of nowhere either. Magic seems to be like energy in physics- it gets converted into its effect, once enabled, the user can use their own 'soul' or humanity to fuel the magic, but it does seem that the user has to have this ability 'activated' in some way, i.e. becoming the Dark One, reading a book of spells, etc. It's not much of a stretch to imagine that the original Dark One was a fairy wish gone wrong (or right, especially when the Reul Ghorm (the Blue Fairy) is known to 'rule the night'.

And so, I don't know how new fairies are made (whether there's a race of fairies and only some choose to become godmothers or whether they're also hatched from eggs), but we know that they, like dwarfs, are very limited in what they're allowed to do. Basically, to me it looks like there two whole slave races whose sole purpose is to bring magic to the world. That is the price of magic, and every time someone wants more, because magic is a limited resource.

And finally that leads to another consideration- if fairy dust is the source of all magic

Still stuck in that time
