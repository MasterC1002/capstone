From the bridge (there were stairs down to where they were just next to me) I bellowed at the top of my lungs and as powerfully as possible for them to stop, if I have to come down there I'll fuck you up, etc etc, they let her go, she bolted for the stairs towards me and they just walked off, their attack failed.

The woman was fine

They had apparently pulled a knife (I didn't see it, so I'm very happy there was no physical confrontation, just disturbing them, letting them know it was no longer a secret event, was enough.

The best self defence is awareness! Don't walk around with earphones in in dark secluded areas!

As an aside I was coming home from my kali training and had a pair of rattan clearly visable in my backpack, but I certainly would have if required, though I don't like the idea of an actual fight with a couple of guys one armed with a knife, even with a pair of stout sticks. Basically I think I looked like more trouble than I was worth. 

Talking to the woman

You don't really have much time to react


 - Those of you in /r/martialarts that have actually been in a real street fight


For me, I tried to talk him down and avoid a confrontation but he wouldn't have it. I was really nervous due to that he had a bit of a possy with him and I kept having images of being boot f**ked, but they were hanging back a bit so I assumed that only this dude wanted me. 

I knew that if he got me down I'd be royally screwed, and that's when he ran in swinging a wild right handed hay maker (which for the record is the dumbest move ever). I stepped in with my right foot and caught his arm and executed Osoto Gari (for those who don't know, it's a Judo technique http://youtu.be/gus3kezcBcM). Except I did my own version, I slammed my right heel against his and palmed the heel of my right hand into his nose as hard as I could. 

He hit the ground, had to sit in my car and try to calm down for quite awhile. I was lucky, it could have gone bad easily, I gambled that the others wouldn't get involved, and I gambled with what I did. What if he pulled a knife? Man was I stupid...but still, it's always a gamble.

I could have so easily misjudged his punch and I could have been the one laying there. All this was racing through my head, and he ""might"" have chased me, I could have just backed off and played the b*tch, I could have done many things but I did this. I don't know how bad his injuries are, what if I killed him? (unlikely, but still I have no idea), what if....

What's funny though, but that's probably for the best because that could just have made him want to come after me again or something. It's bad enough that I have to watch my back now, you never know if the dude you scrap with holds grudges or not. There is ALWAYS a price of some kind, and someone ALWAYS gets hurt.

My bagua sifu told me

""You mean something like white crane or tiger claw?"" I asked.

""No

I was a little bit angry. I

So I asked him

""Boxing is very simple, it will teach you how to find your power. Same ideas. Same principles. Plus, you're young enough to really *do* something with it.""

So I took his advice.

I joined a boxing gym. For the first month, squats, push-ups, etc. 

After what seemed like forever, my chin moved past my knee, and I wasn't extending my shoulders enough. I asked him to teach me something else, but I was told that nothing would be taught until I perfected my jab.

For 6 months, and work on my core. Then I'd critique my jab as I shadow boxed, test it out on the bag, but... something felt off. 

My jab wasn't doing a damn thing. It wasn't driving the bag back. It wasn't quick enough. It just had no *pop*.

How could I fail at something so... *simple*? How would I ever learn kung fu — the discipline I *really* wanted to learn — if I couldn't do something so simple as a jab? 

It wasn't rocket science. It was a simple Point A to Point B movement. Everyone else seemed to be able to do it. Why couldn't I?

Just as I was about to give up on kung fu and boxing and my dreams to be a martial artist

As I was tapping

WTF? I'd been working my ass off for months

Seemed unfair. So I kept hitting the bag with my jab. Nothing interesting happened — at least

I decided to pause. I retraced my steps. What was I doing differently when I fooled around?

Well

But there was more to it. Right at the end of my jab

And it wasn't just my fist either! It was my shoulders, skipping rope, and doing core allowed me to find this *force* that would pulsate out from my knuckles. In effect, I realized my whole body was a coiled spring that could burst with energy at *just* the right moment.

Was this what my sifu was talking about in regards to the internal arts and chi?

I don't know. I'm not going to venture to guess. 

But what I will say is that doing something so *simple* as a jab isn't really simple at all

Whenever I'm in a fight, fought more effectively, or to note and drill with what was particularly successful. I will give you all the breakdown as it happened and what I learned from it. Please feel free to interject observations or other lessons to consider.

I am waiting to go onstage at an open mic night. I am a comedian. I heard two guys at the end of the bar yelling, is being held back. We'll call him Mexican Napoleon. I walk over, hoping to talk down the situation. I fully expect that I might have to help eject Mexican Napoleon. But then Mr. Asshole at the bar keeps taunting him. Another patron asks him why he keeps provoking him, diplomatically trying to get him to cool it. Mexican Napoleon is pushed out. Mr. Asshole tells the diplomat patron to go fuck himself, and then tells me to go fuck myself because I'm standing near. I'm 5'10"", 180lbs, he looked to be 6'3"", swung him into the bar in an arm lock. Lesson 1. I did not hold that arm lock with enough strength. I allowed him enough leverage to use his size against me. He broke loose and I was knocked back, I was on my feet and he held guard. We screamed at him to leave. I made a point of telling him he'd have to fight the entire bar or the cops. I also loudly proclaimed that I had witnessed him batter two people. I used the term batter in hopes that it would take him out of the fight and into a courtroom mentally. I never told him to leave once he stopped attacking because I didn't want to fuel defiance. I let the option of leaving as his decision

The big take away lessons for me are that locks and holds are only useful if you practice them on a resisting opponent. Just knowing the technique is only a part of making the application useful. I'm certain had I been more practiced I would have held him against that bar. Second, even after blows, diplomacy is an option. I allowed him to leave - I didn't talk shit, threaten, challenge or escalate with him verbally. I just stood my ground and kept my hands up. I recently saw here in /r/martialarts a post about the SPEAR system, and I have to say I had been incorporating it into my drills. Even though I didn't use any specific SPEAR technique, when the final dialogue with him was going on I kept my hand up to maintain distance and to highlight a peaceful appeal, I had him spinning into the bar.",t5_2qkt4,True

I started in the 90s and was in it for eleven years, and I wasn't very active for several years. I'd skip classes, tournaments, testing, etc. The tests, by the way, are fucking expensive. 

Two things:

1) This WMAA organization is an offshoot of the World TaeKwonDo Association, in fact, nationwide and I understand there are quite a few in other countries, like Australia.

2) On a personal note, extremely hard. I'm still friends today with many of them. Martial arts-wise, I left and wandered around a few styles for many years, but nowadays have a home in a legit gym doing mma, Danzan Ryu jujitsu, western boxing, and judo. I also cross-train as much as possible in bjj, IDPA shooting

**I'm at work now, ET. AMA!**

But the significance of this event has ramifications beyond one individual’s potential to be a superstar. To explain these ramifications

Different cultures like England, China also has such a tradition. 

About 2, this book disappeared from print. Nevertheless, traditional Chinese martial arts such as Xingyiquan, Choi Lai Fat, and Wing Chun — while implementing techniques *beyond* boxing — place special emphasis on fist techniques. 

When Westerners came to China, and the sport grew rapidly.

In the 1920s

Then after World War II

Unfortunately

Then in 1979, Ali was seen hugging Deng. After this visit, Deng exclaimed, “If we want to win friends, if we want to win respect, we have to win medals”.

Boxing in China was reborn in 1987 when the ban was lifted. Chinese boxers began training again. Lacking the proper equipment, once again China competed in boxing at the 1992 Barcelona Olympics. 

Then in 2004, it would be significant. But he was just getting started.

In 2005 and 2007

Then 2008 Beijing Olympics came. Shiming met Serdamba in the finals. Millions of Chinese tuned to watch these rivals compete. In the course of the fight

China would win another boxing gold medal in the 2008 Olympics. Zhang Xiaoping would win one at light heavyweight. These two medals marked China's arrival as a power in amateur boxing.

But there was no doubt that Shiming was Chinese boxing’s biggest star. After the 2008 Olympics

At 31-years-old, he won his second Olympic gold medal.

Which now brings us to this moment in time. Zou Shiming

China already has a championship fighter in Ziong Zhao Zhong who holds the WBC title at minimumweight. They also have several exciting prospects in the pro ranks — one of whom is Rex Tso who’s promoted by Ricky Hatton.

But just as Zou Shiming marked China as a great power in amateur boxing

What will the future hold? Brian Viloria

I have been in a good amount of fights and I have entered into a good amount of tournaments , I have fought for self-defense reasons and I have fought to have fun. I have fought in front of crowds of people and I have fought in front of a few people. 

I have ""lost"", and I have had so many varying degrees of mental instability/stability that I probably have aged myself well beyond my years. 

I have been in altercations involving knifes, and other weird objects. I have fought people who could grapple, who could jab like a fucking right hand , who were afraid to fight , and who seemed to have no fear. All of it doesn't mean shit. Violence SUCKS

BUT. It happens

I have learned that nothing is definite and fighting is always scary because you will never have any true understanding of what another person is capable of. Honestly, you will have loads of work to do with your mind and you will never ever be the same person afterwords. 

However

Martial Arts will also build your confidence , grapple, run , call for help , ask for mercy, or fight to survive. or a combination of all of the above. 

However, you never know what that person has just went through and where their mind is at. Did they just run 6 miles yesterday and they are sluggish,  did they just get divorced and no longer know which direction is up, are they well-rested and on the prowl to be alpha for the moment. Who knows, you don't know , I won't know , and honestly even they will not know. 

What does seem to help  , BREATHING, not letting your adrenaline take over until it needs too ( which is really really really hard to do, and never will be a sure thing ) , explosiveness and ruthleness. 

Those things will help you survive

I was very respectful, I asked one of the blackbelts to toss me around a bit.  I really wanted to know how it felt.  He was game.  It was a little awkward at first because he was holding back, but once he realized I was serious and I could handle it (not spazzing), things got really fun.  *** I didnt throw any punches, I would arm-shove instead. For throws, he would get me to where I was done for, and let me roll off.  Sweeps, and trips were open season.  

Here is what I took away from the experience:

* Judo is tremendous fun and I would recommend it to anyone.  Everyone there was super chill.  

* Wing Tzun (at least as taught by Boztepe) holds up against Judo.  I was never out of my depth or comfort zone.  Given that the guy was way better at Judo than I am at Wing Tzun

* It is easier to get taken down than I thought.

* It was harder for them to take me down than they thought.

* Maybe their national competitors are beasts, our school takes strength and conditioning pretty seriously, and that is not universal for Wing Chun.

* My athleticism and balance matter way way more in fighting than which style I do.  

* I used textbook Chum Kiu applications, sweeps, and throws with a fair amount of success.   When I did get taken down, it felt the same as losing a Wing Tzun exchange, not like I was destroyed by superior moves.  

* Style wars only exist on the internet.  In the real world

1342794107.0,wvh8f,About Systema,borgs_of_canada,41,8,88,"I have been reading posts on this subreddit for a while

Most people that attended a class in the school where I study Systema have been impressed by the quality of what they were taught. Most of these people are experienced in martial arts and have been practicing for years before discovering Systema. Some are policemen, etc. They all found what they needed in Systema.

On this subreddit

Some of these videos show people moving very slowly, but they are that, drills, not techniques. In the same way, someone could look a martial artist do push-ups and say ""This is stupid, push-up don't work in a real fight"".

Other videos seem incredible. When we watch Ryabko (a fat man who looks nothing like a trained martial artist) or Vladimir Vasiliev hit a big russian in the stomach and the man seems to be on the verge of crying

Some videos are simply too much. We see a man using his psychic powers tu push people without as much as touching them. Well. This is bullshit. But before dismissing a complete martial art because some idiots make weirds videos, it is not a valid reason to dismiss an entire discipline.

""But

Krav Maga is an incredibly efficient combat system. To argue against that would be misinformed at best. However, this kind of training may be harmful. Also, Krav Maga is just that, a combat system.

Systema, but it is also an incredibly complete workout system and includes healing techniques. More importantly, it focuses on breathing concepts (the most important thing in Systema) and psychological education (how to deal with the aftermath of combat without getting PTSD, etc). There is only so much I can write about the teachings of Systema on a reddit post.

""But there is no sparring in systema

I honestly have no idea where that comes from. It is false. There is a lot of sparring and pressure testing.

""These people simply soak hits directly in the stomach. It is stupid

Believe it or not, avoid being hit. Also, in the classes where these drills happen, we have a lot of warm-up to prepare the body for such a shock. 

""I attended a Systema class and it sucked""

Every martial art has some poor teachers. I met one myself that was incredibly dangerous for anyone who trained with him. And he stank. Systema is little known and there is no belt system. Some people use that fact to declare themselves instructors with no real competence. If you attend a systema class and it sucks

Some schools tend to distance themselves from the traditionnal Russian methods and beliefs. These schools put a lot of enphasis on pressure testing and sparring

1327793801.0,p11mw,Thoughts on aikido,pma,41,5,45,"As there has been a lot of talk about aikido on this subreddit lately
thoughts I've been having. This is part rant
sentence of this text with ""in my opinion"" before complaining.


**The (sad) state of aikido today**

I don't want to write too much about this as most peoply won't likely be interested in the internal politics of aikido
and how it has affected the art itself
To quickly sum it up: most of the aikido practised today is crap. There are a few reasons for it:

* Lack of quality control by the International Aikido Federation. I'm sad to say it
interested in getting the money coming in from graduations than they are on the quality of the art.

* The focus of IAF on making aikido more widespread and ""accessible"" has taken the edge out of the art. I couldn't find the
exact quote
make it suitable for normal people.""

* (I have preface this point as being hearsay
aren't interested in open discussion about these things. They seem to be happy with the current system and the status they
have earned within it.

* There is an alarmingly large percentage of aikido teachers who either think that aikido isn't effective as a martial art
or aren't interested in its effectiveness. And if you don't think it's effective
effective way.

* The importance of many things like tegatana and kokyo has been largely lost.

* Even if all those things were corrected,
demands a style of moving the body that is very different from what modern people (especially in the western world) aren't
used to and is very dependant on correct technique: if your technique is off
an aikido technique gone wrong will only make it worse.


**It isn't just wristlocks you know (or: how the basic principles of aikido should be taught)**

A lot of aikido schools heavily base their beginners curriculum on techniques against wristgrabs. As a result
easily focus too much on the movement of the arms and fail to understand the principles and importance of body movement. And
when that happens they are left completely defenseless if somebody attacks them in way that makes the arms useless. They will
later on be taught stuff that requires more
bad habits and misunderstandings. Contrast to that
grabbing the shoulders
techniques work. After getting the body movement right

Another important point is that techniques should be taught more from kihon (that is
students don't have large amounts of opponents momentum to take advantage of so they have to activate the situation themselves
which leads to better understanding of the technique. Sadly
because it doesn't look (and feel) that flashy.

Also
is a common ""core"" to all techniques and what that core is


**Try to understand what happens and why

In this section I will try to outline the elements of an effective aikido technique. I have kept each part short for
readability

* Connection: You have a center of mass. Your opponent has a center of mass. The attack forms a connection point. The goal
is to form a strong connection between those centers of mass through that connection point and then do stuff with it. If you
don't have a connection to your opponents center
you if the rest of the opponents body is moving freely.

* Destabilisation: After you get that connection (or
opponents balance. A stable opponent is strong
to take your opponents center of mass outside his base of support. At that point
you. After destabilisation the opponent should be kept in a constant state of unstability troughout the technique.

* Body structure: Destabilising the opponent only helps if you keep yourself stable and strong. Maintain a low center of mass.
Keep your hands in front of your chest and stomach
are bent too much you have to use a lot of muscle
upper arms
head up (almost to the point where you look a bit snobbish). Engage your core muscles. Breath correctly

* Body movement: Moving yourself is always easier than moving your opponent
many still try the opposite). If you move in the correct way with good body structure while maintaining the connection
opponent will be forced to react.

* Direction of force: There are angles where the muscles are naturally strong and angles where the muscles are naturally weak.
The force vectors should be made so that your strength goes against your opponents weakness. After you start applying force
the angles change and you must correct accordingly. This results in the spherical movement typical to aikido.

* Atemi: Sometimes the direction you move in to keep force vectors ideal isn't safe. Learn to recognise these situations and
apply atemi to create space and to make your opponent use his hands to block instead of hitting you. Atemi should also be used
when you want to maintain proper distance. According to Morihei Ueshiba, hit.

* Timing: ""For aikido to work
If you move too late
succeeded but already thinks he will. Move decisively at that exact moment.",,t5_2qkt4,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/martialarts/comments/p11mw/thoughts_on_aikido/

Anyway, even though I speak some Korean.

So I usually end up a bit confused because of the language barrier but it wasn't a huge deal because I thought it was more authentic because he was Korean.

My issue is with what happened today during our private lesson. He was teaching me blocks (high

But then he switched it to a self defense class

Then he came up to me and said ""Now if a guy grabs you like this..."" and then he proceeded to grab my ass, yea it's possible. But couldn't he just explain it, or at least keep his hands on my back because it's pretty much close enough without...touching me. And he asked me to do it back to him, to grab his ass as he showed me how to deflect it and I don't know I just felt uncomfortable.

Am I reading into it too much? Is this just common for a teacher to get really close like this to teach a student what would happen in a real life situation or does this set off any red flags for anyone else. Please let me know because I want to make sure I'm learning as much as I can and I'm going to a good school and have a good instructor. I don't just want to learn self defense moves that one could learn in a class at their gym. I want to learn taekwondo

Thanks guys. I just feel uncomfortable after class tonight.

**TL;DR - Very new to TKD

Edit: Now that I think about it, and dear god I'm a small girl, I can't lift a full grown man! I tried because he asked me to but I couldn't really do it so he just laughed nervously and told me I did a good job. Felt super weird. Forgot to add that part.

**EDIT 2: Just went back to the school to get all my money back since I had just recently paid and barely had finished my trial period. I went with my dad so I didn't have to risk being alone with him when I confronted him and told him why I wanted my money back. He complied and now I have the money and will be putting it towards a much better school. Now thanks to everyone's extremely helpful comments,False,,t5_2qkt4,1366858375.0,,,t3_1czjez

* When they finally found a Muay Thai instructor he would never refer to me by my name but rather as ""the worst one"" and ""the one with the terrible jab""

* Whenever i asked a question i was met with "" *sigh* i don't know why this is so hard for you to understand""

* fast forward a bit

* The instructors eventually stopped showing up and only appeared when it was convenient for them

* During conditioning classes they (the instructors) would always make fun of me and tell me how i was proportionally weaker than the women in the class.

1376559467.0,1kernz,stick vs rope – another major difference between wing chun an karate + some physics,shashkes,42,7,22,"It sounds like a cliché’ and I’m pretty sure I’ve heard others use this distinction when describing the differences between karate and wing chun but after a month and a half of win chun training (and 16 years of karate or so) today was the first time I felt it on myself and it was pretty cool.

I’ve been doing some pushing hands for years
In karate we deal with opposing force coming towards us either by applying a greater force (i.e. kicks your opponent as he moves towards you or block a punch) or by moving so the force doesn't come in contact with you but instead glides past you. Today I realized something wing chun does which I have never encountered in Karate
To explain this I’m going to have to use some physics so bear with me.

The force of a hit creates a pressure wave that moves through the body. In karate we practice a lot to focus this wave so it will go deep into the body and create the most damage (minimizing the surface area we hit with and the duration of the hit while maximizing acceleration and mass). 

I’ve already noticed that when wing chun people block they maximize the duration of the block but today I noticed something very new to me. They don’t really block! They wait for the pressure wave to reach each joint which is completely relaxes. When the wave reaches their elbow it sort of collapses inwards and next comes their shoulder

It’s like hitting a rope
It felt really amazing to manage to relax into a “block” and feel this space in my elbows. My only question is what amount of force can this tactic withstand and how fast can my joints adapt?

Three years ago, because they were the only school in my area of New York that offered Muay Thai classes. So I signed up. They gave me sort of a ""special"" contract because I had trained there from the time I was 7 until I was 15, and I was friends with the Muay Thai instructor. I took classes for three months and felt like I learned nothing. The classes were the same exact thing every day. Warm up, shadow box, kick pads, spar. No real technique training, no serious amount of instruction. I used the class as a supplement to my karate class. We did regular ju-kumite in Karate

One day, and crashed into a bench. I ended up being seriously injured. The second I hit the bench I started screaming in pain, it hurt like nothing I'd ever felt before. I'm rolling around in pain, and all the THREE instructors there do is as follows:

* Instructor 1 continues sparring.
* Instructor 2 makes a joke at my expense.
* Instructor 3 (who was the instructor I believed to be my friend) looks over

Finally, and the person I was sparring sees this and freaks out. He asks if there's anything he can do to help, so I have him grab my phone. I call my parents, and 15 minutes later, my dad arrives. Now, I've been injured for 20 minutes at this point, bleeding all over. And the three instructors have continued to ignore my cries for help. No one has called an ambulance, gauze

Fast forward to yesterday night. I'm now in college in Boston and I have just started taking Muay Thai classes at a gym nearby. I had an existing injury to my left knee that was pretty serious earlier in the year, pretty much buckles sideways, and I fall to the ground in pain. Now, I've had knee injuries before and this definitely hurt the most out of all of them, but it was far from the worst injury I've ever had. I was in pain, sure, but I handled it fine. In this case however, including the ones who weren't teaching came over to see if I was okay. One offered to call an ambulance, motrin, dropped me off in the emergency room

I'm currently on crutches, I was beyond impressed by how caring the instructors at this school were. They'd known me some for only a few days, and some not at all, yet every single one truly cared for my well being and wanted to see me well again. They went out of their way to make sure I got all the help I needed. It was truly amazing to me.

TL;DR: I'm extremely injury prone. McDojos laugh at your obviously serious injuries. Legitimate schools care about even the ones that seem potentially minor and go out of their way to help.

This has been mainly because I have had a protective childhood. My routine as a child was-school, doesn't have friends and cannot relate or make friends.

I have been bullied allthrough school
 
Now
like to ensure that I do not get bullied at my new workplace. 
[I have an engineering degree and work in networking domain]
Redditors
What happens to me when I get bullied: 
I just feel like shouting at people when they pass remarks, feel jittery and my heart starts pounding...and I just don't react. This obviously gives other's the impression that I am chickening out...so there is more humiliation. I never get respect as a person because I do not stand up:(


People knowing martial arts...throw some perspective on this. I am sure you were scared earlier and MA has helped you get a confident personality.....

For the sake of clarity, yet it points out the first hidden assumption:  A martial art must be “practical”.


*

So why is this wrong?  First, but it is there nonetheless.

*


Just for a quick check:  Parkour – not, Turkish Oil Wrestling – is.  American Football – not (violence is supposed to be incidental - really).


(And, but not intrinsically necessary.)


*

So, to a fight, to a brawl, to a riot, to a war, all situations have rules. These rules may be social (guys in fight with a “friend” don’t kick each other in the balls), sporting (no punches to the face), crotch kicking set of techniques to a Taekwondo tournament is not a formula for success. Conversely


*

Let us create our own martial art.  We’ll call it “Toast Fu” just for fun. This art is designed to be taught to people who work in corporate offices. As such, but no throws. Ground work is out, but chokes and standing submissions are in.  Improvising things like throwing laptops is in. Eye pokes are generally out.  Wearing clothing that restricts movement is common.  Now, great, we have a martial art. It is practical, but only in those environments. Is “Toast Fu” a good training for a bar fight situation? Probably, sort of


*


The “in the name of making money” is, then it is in the business of making money. How much money always depends, but all businesses need to make money. Clubs, organizations, and even monasteries need to make at least enough money to pay expenses or they cease to exist. So let’s get to really what the problem is:


*

“Watered Down”. Ok, the curriculum must be structured for them. No different than if a class was structured for “seniors”. Does that mean some techniques are not taught? Yes. Is that watered down? No. It is simple ensuring that the student gets the most that they can out of the class. If a student is fat, or old, or young, or anything but a fit male 21-34, then the training is different. It isn’t watered down, it is appropriate for the situation of the student. It is, more practical


*

If you are an adult male in the prime of your fitness life, your needs to train change as does the goal of your training. That is good and natural. If you called your middles school you attended a “McSchool” that taught a watered down version of math, you would be laughed at. Same with calling any school that teaches kids martial arts. The school is teaching a martial art, it is just what is practical for a kid.  If you are an adult, you shouldn’t be taking a kids course, but really, if you need to be told this


*

Lastly the most laughable aspect of the FUD (Fear, a common everyday food that the unwashed masses consume, then there must be a great number of these unprepared and overconfident students. Bullshit. The streets are not filled with people who think they can fight but they can’t. Do some kids who study martial arts think they are bigger than they are only to not be as good as they thought? Yes. Guess what, that is part of growing up. Once you hit “the real world”, many people find out they aren’t as good as they thought they were at lots of things. Being tough is just one of many things people need to reassess as they get older. This FUD is just whining about how growing up sucks. And, if you are an adult who started studying a martial art and thought you became a badass (no matter what art, no matter how “practical”, then you are an idiot. Sorry


*

As you grow up, your situation changes, the rules change. People who complain about “McDojo’s” don’t understand that. Places for kids to train are great and wonderful and if the same place also successfully trains adults, then even better. Many teachers can connect with only kids or only adults and those that can with both are truly special. If a teacher opens a school that caters to kids and teaches lots of kids and is successful at teaching kids.  Lots of kids come, some learn more than others, some not as much. Then someone else comes by and looks down on the teacher because the kids don’t do what adults do and then tags the teacher’s school with a pejorative. If you heard that person say that, you wouldn’t think that the teacher is wrong.  You would think that the person who looked down on the teacher is wrong.  And you would be right.


*

I’d close with a pathetic plea about what an interweb toughguy I am for posting this and that downvoting such thinking against the hivemind is an act of cowardice



*

TL;DR – Sorry

I'm interested in hearing your countries laws

Here is a very simple nutshell of the laws in Sweden:

Firstly

**Self defence**: Of yourself or your property. You can also take over the self defence of another, as they may say you could have used less force and controlled the situation better due to your training and experience).

**Need**: A lesser claim, you can break and enter a random summer house out of 'need' to shelter and await rescue (eg if a storm is approaching or there is a risk of exposure).

**Belief**: If you have good reason to believe you are in danger, or if they threaten you, you can get the first hit in and claim self defence in the belief you were in danger. Similarly, if you are being chased and hide in a public toilet, you hear the guy looking for you, the door to your cubical opens and you stick your foot straight in the face of a random stranger just wanting to relieve themselves, you will also not be prosecuted for assaulting the stranger as you as you reasonably believed it was your assailant trying to attack you. Interestingly, because if they are not clearly understood to be police they can get a few smacks in the face and not be able to charge for it.

**Understandable behaviour**: Can lead to reduced or dismissed charges. For a clear and harsh example, clearly unable to defend himself. As the situation was stopped, you can no longer claim 'self defence' for further attacks, which are now legally 'assault'. However, going nuts on this guy is 'understandable' given the circumstances, and it is likely you will incur no charges.

**Use of a weapon in self defence**: This is fine so long as it isn't 'obviously excessive'. So a guy punching you and you stabbing him 12 times is likely not going to fly. You can only have a weapon if you have a good reason to carry one, so the kubotan keyrings could be quite hard to explain, especially if it is recognised by an officer at the scene. The unbreakable umbrella would likely always be fine however.

Sounds obvious right? Well now here is the hardest part of truly learning the reality of self defense

So then what do you do if you ever find yourself cornered by 5 pissed off assholes with no shot of escape? Well lets lay this out in two scenarios . First we will assume that their purpose was to rob or intimidate you not to outright kill you, so you throw a hook to one and try to run. Then they grab you and knock you to the ground, and then they beat you or kill you. In this scenario you have succeeded in one thing and that is displaying yourself as a threat to them physically. Now when they attack you they are doing so with the understanding that you are dangerous, and will probably not stop beating you till you are severely injured. Now lets take a look at another option or scenario B. You realize you have no shot of escape, after offering them your money they are still there threatening and shoving you. So you lie down on the ground in fetal position covering your head and say please don't kill me. Sounds stupid right? Well here is the reality, you are more likely to survive with less injury that way. If they have already accomplished taking your money the remainder of their aggression would usually be rooted in proving a point. See in this scenario you have never displayed yourself as a physical threat. They will more likely than not be satisfied with a minor beating or perhaps none at all.

The ultimate truth about self defense is that you need to know when it is not worth fighting. If you are drastically outnumbered begging for your life and seeming weak and pitiful may save your life. The second you attack in defense you become a threat that they need to neutralize. When you fight back even a little they now can justify beating you to a bloody pulp. If you curl up and beg for mercy even the most sick twisted punks will be reluctant to beat a man curled up in a ball to death. 

This is a hard pill to swallow but if you value staying alive above all else it might be wise to consider when it is in your advantage to show not aggression. This can apply to all fields of self defense as well. In BJJ for example a common self defense stance from standing is the ""prayer stance"". The purpose of this stance is to provide adequate defense while never ""putting your fists up"". The idea is to avoid the fight at all costs and taking a defensive stance can be enough to provoke an attack. 

Sorry for the long rambling article I have just been thinking a lot about this lately and would love feedback. 


EDIT: 
So some people seem to be missing the point of what I am saying here. I am not advising you to go out and add fetal begging as a tactic


And anyone saying ""this is unrealistic"" is taking what I am saying literally and completely missing the point! ",,t5_2qkt4,1375062226.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/martialarts/comments/1j4809/the_ultimate_truth_about_self_defense/

I understand. I was an orange belt about twenty years ago when I got in my first (pause for dramatic effect) MARTIAL ARTS BATTLE!

One gentleman in my class, he was probably just dealing with a lot of at-home stress from his parents and reiterating cycles of dominance and verbal abuse of which he had been part, but I was young and stubborn and I had a great sense of justice: I wasn't having whatever he was saying. Being boys in the schoolyard, he decided he wanted to settle our differences in manly fashion, and took a good stance.

I was terrified. Did I mention he was in the same martial school I was, and he knew more than I did anyway! As stress shocked my system and I stood there trying to verbally defuse the situation, he took a quick step and fired a flying side kick at my face!

Why do we study math principles? Why do we study language structure? Surely not to analyze everything we do, in my opinion, the same. I didn't want to get kicked in the face.

So, effectively behind him in mid-air). I had studied strategy (homework: read Sun Tzu's Art of War) and was paying attention to the ground and environment. I had stood in front of an ice slick. As he passed, I pulled down on his pant leg slightly and he dropped right onto the ice, slipping into an uncontrolled splits and hurting himself too much to follow me as I walked away. Is this good martial arts?

As I child

But now I realize that is why we train. When a rational

Bruce Lee said (paraphrased): To the untrained, one begins to see and differentiate between style and form and technique. But when mastery has been reached, the circle completes, and a punch is just a punch again.  There is only human physical movement, and we are all built relatively the same. Components of structure and angular momentum and neuromuscular irradiation are either synchronized or disparate based on training and mindset and situational variables, but the body is a lot simpler than thousands of martial art styles may imply. Just as thousands of love letters in hundreds of languages are all trying to express similar basic needs and desires, so too are most martial styles and techniques about moving out of or into danger, submitting to or dominating some situation. Everything else is commentary

The gift of humanity is infinite freedom, and it is perfectly normal for your instincts to feel choppy and confused: you're still trying to program yourself, so you question everything you're doing as you do it. This is healthy biofeedback in a training environment. Improvisation is the highest iteration of performance skill, whether the field be music or theatre or martial arts. You can only riff off what you know, and you're only as confident as you've practiced to be. You will be scared about face shots until you've practiced enough to teach your nerves that it's okay; avoiding them will, by definition, increase your instinct to avoid them in the future.

It would be poor training to set yourself up for failure, lightly tap your own face.

STAY BELOW STRESS RESPONSE.

The goal is to teach yourself, and work your way up to gentle slaps. If you're not planning on being competitive there is no need to proceed further, and strong trauma to the brain case is a bad idea in general, but light taps and slaps will help you relax, over time, if you stay below stress response.

As for instinct; go SLOWER! Slow is smooth, practice in your mind, practice practice practice. When you have practiced DEEP enough (see The Talent Code) then your body responds to a simple thought, and you can spend less processing power doing and more planning. That's when you move from practical to tactical.

I recently had an argument with an acquaintance, and possibly get some stats too. (I apologize if this has been done to death before.) Guy in question was young, kickboxing 5 years. Me: F, 7-8 years karate.

Each of the points that were brought up:

A) Men are stronger than women (average Joes.)

Me: Generally speaking


B) Statistically

Me: I haven’t found any statistics stating this, the belief that muscle mass is of paramount importance, and a forced gender divide.


C) Men’s strength is a natural boon that it’s enough to win fights

Me: While strength (meaning muscle mass) is something that men gain easier, myth or fact?) due to a lower body weight may have an easier time training speed than men. Women are, due to the lack of brute strength, more aware of openings and technique to be used (and therefore put more focus on training that) since there is the natural *need* to compensate.


D) Flexibility is irrelevant

Me: Doesn’t this help with fluidity? And since we're talking equal training (stretching time) here


E) A woman who has done well in Amateur (such that she’s going pro) will statistically lose against males not competing at that level (just training matches)

Me: A female going pro = a male generally training? o.O Does that seem off to anyone else?


F) Males must often go easy on females in matches to balance out the natural gap.

Me: … there’s a natural gap? (Going “easy” on an opponent just because of their gender seems to be an insult – as if their hard work and training doesn’t make them equal and worthy of your attention.)


G) The guys saying women “aren’t that good” are just saying that to balance out the merging of tiers

Me: Or their saying that to buff up their egos


What do you agree and disagree with here? Any experiences you'd like to share


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

My personal take

I have a close friend who spent years in MMA. She experienced similar sexism

During the argument between me and this guy, I believe) were consistently going easy on her and still winning. She just “wasn’t that good”.  I think I see a similar theme going on here..

A bunch of shots were taken at my proficiency as well (small wrist size means I couldn’t possibly have blocked anything, which adds to my belief that much of his points really were based in stereotypes and.. well, sexism.


*Now, they can be on par. And that's it's kind of insulting to automatically assume your opponent, who's been working as hard as you, is inferior.

There’s still seems to be a lot of sexism in martial arts; that’s something only time and a lot open minds will change. 

But that’s just my take. Now I want yours!

I was working with my senior student on some insert drills when, picked up a kris blank for myself, and we went back to the drill.

Now, now would I?

So the drill was going quite smoothly for a few minutes

I spent the next few minutes verifying that, no, my contact was not still lodged in some far corner of my eye.  That, yes, my eyes dilated and tracked the same still.  And other basic first aid.

This morning I had a doctor check me out (eye injuries are nothing to mess with) and he said it appears the impact was mainly on my eyelid and not on the eye itself.

This is in the craziest category.  I started my MA training in college in Baltimore so there are some characters in the city.  One mid-aged guy who came to train with us on occasion was a black belt in my style.  He only came occasionally  because he had a lot of family/personal issues

One day he covers for my master and begins the class by whipping out some rusty ass knife from under his uniform.  He tells us that some Vietnamese guy sold it to him and it was poisoned.  Someone asked what poison.  Apparently the Vietnamese during the Vietnam War had a tradition of poisoning their knives by pissing and shitting on their knives when they were out in the jungle.  So even the smallest cut would give you tetanus and crazy shit poison.

And then we begin to do knife drills with this thing.  We all thought it was cool.  Luckily this guy restrained himself instead of stabbing us with the rubber knives like he usually does.

The second part of the lesson was learning what it felt like to be knocked out.  We did this one at a time.  The victim would sit cross-legged on the floor against the wall and breathe shallow and quickly for 30 seconds.  The victim was then instructed to stand up quickly and then he proceeded to wrap his hands around around the victim's neck and choke them.  I saw my friend drop like a fly (caught by the crazy black belt) and then spasm on the floor.  The black belt then said something about knowing which vertebrae to hit

Then it was my turn

**tl;dr**
Crazy black belt subbed for class, and piss covered Vietnamese poison dagger and then he proceeded to gently knock us out with a choke and then wake us up again with a hit to some vertebrae that apparently sends a shock to your brain.

**still tl;dr**
I almost fucking died.

Please, a lot of those are made to appeal to the audience using fast/useless movements. I'm not saying ALL movies have this, but I would say most martial arts movies change the martial art to appeal more to the audience.

Oh and in case you're wondering where Kali might have been in the media

Here's a sample of the martial art: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYDWCE_oZRo&amp;list=PLDQsx9DNWK5QVl8qGOPcWf9x8ACdJqwOX

**It's all about pinning the shoulder.** Watch this entire video:

In Muay Thai, at 1:56, it quite clearly illustrates what I've been doing with my arms:

If you watch the whole video

When my Muay Thai instructor spars, but I never figured out what he did differently. I now think he took a breath out, and pinned the shoulders. 

With my hands at guard position, my biceps are soft and squashy.

One big difference between Muay Thai and Wing Chun is when practising, which I always felt vulnerable because it goes against Muay Thai's idea of protecting the head.

Now that I know how to pin my shoulder

So, am I on the right path? I've going to try it next week and see if my techniques improve.

Basically they are taught only the most basic stuff, even special forces don't get much more. It's purpose was not really to teach close combat, more to train controlled aggression. 

He said it was down to two real reasons

I believe the original discussion centred around the difference between police and the army. Police in the UK can't rely on guns to bring someone in, they don't have to worry about keeping the people they are immediately fighting alive, it's much simpler. 

So there you go. That's the jist of a much longer conversation.

The master-disciple relationship, I feel that the focus on fighting can be detrimental to the more important goals. Many forget that the ultimate goal of life is happiness and the increase of one's quality of life, and for countless of people, going to self-defense seminars or solely practicing MMA is not directly helping them achieve those goals. It's a good hobby, but it's not facing the problems of the individual. They need other things next to their martial arts to help them through life. The master-disciple relationship on the other hand is directly involved with solving the problems that stand in the way of the individual's happiness. Yes I am talking about 'spiritual' development, although I don't like to use this word. It sounds too esoteric. It should be called 'learning how to deal with life in practical ways'. A good master is more than just a guide in fighting, he should be a practical guide of life itself. And because he (or she) is both

Most modern martial arts don't cover this aspect because it's too difficult and time-consuming for a trainer to talk about a practitioner's personal issues. It's not his goal, that is the goal. That's the big difference with traditional schools, where you can sit down with the master or teacher and talk about your life while sipping tea. These people have been 'trained' to be guides. They can give you advice and guidance or even help you by giving you personal mental/spiritual/physical/social exercises. And it's all happening within the school, which can be a therapeutic environment in itself. It's a lot like a Buddhist school in a way. You have the Buddha (master), Dharma (teaching, martial arts curriculum), and Sangha (fellow practitioners). 

Another thing is culture. Chinese culture in my case. Just doing a lion-dance may seem ridiculous or even a waste of time for many modern martial artists. But look at the training of lion dance! It's very hard training. And look at the benefits it brings to the group! Look at the social bonds it creates within the school. The school makes money, it's about developing all of the people within the school as a group. It's much like a family.

But this is the kind of thing nobody wants or cares to talk about because it's not important now. All that matters is 'if your style is effective on the street' and your individual physical progress with the martial art. I agree that that is important to test your style (within the boundaries of realistic testing) but still,False,,t5_2qkt4,False,,,t3_moe1e

* Kid black belts: the younger the black belt

I was in the Juniors group

* Belt Factory: If students are promoted quickly

Grading was held every 3 months

* Point sparring: If the ONLY sparring that is done is ""point"" or ""tournament"" sparring, no catching, trips, throws, take downs, joint locks, grappling, legs, and spins.

No head contact, sweeps were allowed, but all together it seemed to be I strike, you block, you strike I block.

* If the idea of take-downs or wrestling is never addressed

I only remember two basic sweeps which appeared in 2 separate sessions and were never mentioned again. Also
**Edit** I suppose I think of different schools being a bit homogeneous and since we didn't do groundwork

* If the test for belt advancement consists mostly or entirely of memorization and making your form &amp; one-steps look pretty 

This was how they graded us until we reached higher ranks where sparring was introduced

* If the self-defense techniques that are taught aren't at full speed or contact

Self-defence techniques were taught far and few between

* If the school has many students

The organization has schools set up around and outside my town

This subreddit has seemed to be working well under the newly codified set of rules which were put out a couple of weeks ago with one exception.

    

It has been brought to my attention that the idea behind one of the rules which I had posted was misconstrued as well as appearing to be a personal attack against some people on this subreddit which was not intended.

The rule in question was: 

&gt;If you're needlessly putting down others martial art =&gt; REMOVED (Some of our regulars should pay attention to this

This has generated some controversy over the word **needlessly** so I thought I would explain my reasoning and suggest a rewording which has been suggested by /u/TopTomCat.

Needlessly in this case doesn't refer to the TMA/MMA argument
People who study Tae Kwon Do or Ninjitsu are regularly targets of this sort of abuse. Normally these comments aren't seen by all participants since they are heavily downvoted by the community. After such scenes the participants are warned and the offending comments removed. Several people who semi-regularly posted on this subreddit have been removed for abuse after receiving numerous warnings about abusive behaviour.

A new wording of these rules have been made which will be subject to community approval and then the offending rule in the Rules section will be changed.


&gt; Insulting

This means that:

* I believe TKD is a lesser art as it doesn't incorporate live full-contact sparring.

* Kata are not useful in a current martial arts environment unless they are incorporated into a usable form where each move is understood.


are acceptable

* Ninjitsu is a shitty art because everyone who does it is fat and gay

is not.

If anyone has any comments or other feeling about this rule change please suggest alternatives

I went for one BJJ trial class at an MMA gym and ended up replacing one of my weekly Wing Tzun training days with a BJJ day.  So now it is one day of each per week.  I've been at BJJ for about 3 months now so still very n00b.  I thought this time I would address what I view as a common debate theme in this subreddit.  **Keep in mind, and I dont feel I am qualified in either art to speak with any authority.**  

*TMA or combat sport?*  I think I like the Erik Paulson stance that each augments the other.  If you are doing BJJ

I think there was an intensity level that needed to be addressed in my WT.  But, I think brutal techniques are granted more stopping power than they would actually deliver in real life by the TMA community.  

However, at fully resisting intensity, then all of a sudden those brutal techniques you learned in WT are completely available to you.  And, by having no fear of a ground battle, you can be that much more aggressive in a stand up fight, a la the Diaz Brothers.  

Just my thoughts.  

Oh and one dig at my WT brothers: how is a choke not a deadly technique?  BJJ is just as 'deadly' as WT.  :P

I train in a traditional style so we have forms.  They're a part of testing, this inclination will differ from master to master.  I'm just lucky.  Also I try to be smart about things.  The deep stances ain't going to help you out in a bar fight.  However, they are again a part of our heritage and considered artistic to a varying extent.  I appreciate that.

While extremely unrealistic with their deep stances and rigid movements, and helps you chain techniques together.  I look at like lifting weights.  I try to get into perfect stance, use the exact amount of muscle tensions and timing (hard and soft style, it's extremely important to be rigid only at the moment of striking), breathing, mental focus, and overall execution.  All these things combined

In our tournaments there are forms and there is sparring.  So being half of what you bring to a tournament

TL;DR
My master treats forms as a part of our heritage and not something to fight with.  I use forms like I use weights.  They condition a few very specific things.  Doing them to perfection in itself can become something beautiful worthy of applaud.  For fighting

Feel free to answer the question the way you want. This goes far beyond the reasons you picked up your favourite martial art. Why did you take up martial arts? Why do keep up practising a martial art?

I've been interested in martial arts since I was a kid, I don't remember why, somehow the martial art topic was brought up. My brother mentioned there was a gym next door, we decided to take up something. We asked what they taught, and we took up BJJ. It was by chance, but after a year or so I like BJJ very much.

Why do I train for? I don't compete, I never was a sportive guy, I work full time and study, so it's hard for me to train and improve... it's very challenging, but it's highly rewarding...

Additionally, he can't move his legs... he sits on the tatami and teaches us newaza and tachiwaza... he never misses a class, even when he can't get to the gym by himself (he must be accompanied by his mother, his brother or the other instructor)... that's very inspiring, and this certainly makes me keep up with the training... if I'm exhausted, my body hurts, it downpours or I'm just in no mood for training,,False,t3_1hkjx7

Now, if I weren't sure of the level of instruction offered.

However, but usually it wasn't for six months, or a year.  It was until the end.  Whatever end.  Didn't like that?  You didn't learn.  Commitment allows the instructor to take your request to learn seriously.  Remember, the old way of learning was the students sought out the teacher, hoped to become a pupil.  Not the other way around.  Commitment gives the instructor time to teach you well, not just try to cram a few basics down your throat before the end of the month.  

It's when that asking for commitment is not followed with legitimate instruction that problems occur.  As an instructor, then we move on.  Teaching a fifteen minute lesson and then asking for a $200 down payment and a 6 month contract is irresponsible on the part of the instructor.  You are supposed to be forming a relationship with the student.  You cannot know the student in 15 minutes.  

However, but you hate forms/kata.  A good instructor knows the value of everything they teach and will know how those forms will benefit you in the long run.  Month-to-month students might be more willing to leave when forms are introduced because they don't find value in them.  Contractual students are required to learn them regardless, and later they realize the acquired benefit.  

As a teacher, so that by next September, you already can handle the shift in intensity.  And so on.  If you're going to be gone next month, that makes my careful planning worthless, effectively wasting both of our time.  Contracts show that it's not useless for me to take that time and consideration for the student.  I don't have to worry about the short term instant gratification, and I can start preparing long term.  

It also provides me with a steady stream of income.  Let's face it, advertising needs, the cost of living for the instructor).  Those financial requirements are paid for in majority by students' tuition.  If I'm uncertain the income I'm going to be receiving for the school next month, I'm more stressed and my attitude toward the school, students, and the whole institution is going to be affected.  That's just human nature.  

I never worried about letting students try out class for a month first because I know my teaching is good enough for them to want to continue.  Perhaps this is why most McDojos don't like such lengthy trial periods.  They are going to be found out sooner or later.  But later I do get most of my students on six-month to year-long contracts.

For me

1. Optimal angle and strike type for knockout blows to the head. Requisite power and speed levels for such a strike.
2. Effects of knuckle conditioning on punching power and penetration (if any).
3. Whether and which knife defense techniques really work against simulated

1) 'My Striking art alone is not enough

2) 'Their techniques are designed for the ring

3) 'Grappling is best

   Now, we do. The important thing is not the arguments themselves, but the changes that they wrought on the greater culture of Martial training, namely the fact that something was expected of each and every Art now, that being a reaction to the new data that had been borne from those early fights. It's inescapable, every one of them had to either rationalize why they were still effective, or prove it by becoming increasingly competitive in scope. More than anything else, and I think that because of the UFC

The tone between the comments in these two threads is a lot different.  Are they the same thing?  Is there a double standard?  Were these instructors justified in their actions?  

Do you feel that you or your instructor would or have they already accepted challenges to prove the efficacy of your art to people off the street?  If so would there be rules and protective gear.  Would either person be allowed to tap or quit?  How far would you take it?

If you suspected that the person was mentally handicapped or on drugs would that change your opinion?

Although my employers over the past 14 years have all had some form of ground-fighting in their training, ground fighting has always been stressed as a bad idea, but one that you train for if you end up there.  The Army's reasoning was that you could train aggression in a controlled manner, use minimal safety equipment, and not have a high injury rate.  Also, their thinking was that if you end up entangled, you were only working for control until you got the assistance of a buddy, so you basically work enough to either get to your feet


Today, gravel, and pavement.  For the previous week and a half of 8-hours of daily fighting, we had mostly been on a padded floor, with occasions on some type of smooth granite.  In the Army, most fighting takes place on mats or in a pit of some wonderfully soft material that will be in your clothing for the rest of the day.


Let's take a very basic technique: Escape from the mount.  Opponents is on top, and roll to that side, ending up in their guard (and you work an escape from there).  If you have never done this on the concrete, make sure that you are ready to have your arm and elbow violently exfoliated (yes, as the defender).  It was literally at the point where, should I have to perform this in the real word, once I gained the position of advantage


If, and the other person has any level of competence (literally, all they need is enough to make it so stuff doesn't instantly work, so you have to actually struggle for something) I hope you are wearing long sleeves or a heavy jacket.  Almost every technique has a trade-off in pain and/or blood.  In the mount?  Your knees and knuckles will hate you, as well as any part of your arm during any control that puts your arm in contact with the ground.  Americana?  You can only do it to one side because it exposes your weapon on the other side.  Also, say goodbye to the skin on your forearms.  Kimura?  Less pain, except for the weapon exposure on one of the sides, and then make what I can only describe as a humping motion


Also fun training: fighting after being hit with Oleoresin Capsicum.  Just you

Edit: Ground controls, we can start calling aikido ""ground fighting"", too.

Edit: Forgot to mention that I was in a short sleeve shirt for the training.  I did not know this was going to happen.",,t5_2qkt4,1351272240.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/martialarts/comments/123pf8/groundfighting_on_pavement/

I am now wondering whether I should continue studying Taekwondo at my current school
My current school I worry is a McDojo. While the master (a 7th dan and legit worldwide recognised master) is excelent
1. Sparring is mostly non contact, and although I am sure this helps some aspects of self defence, mainly footwrok and what have you, I think proper contact sparring would be a better solution.
2. The use of belts. Don't get me wrong, and black belts who wouldn't stand a chance next to the average 12 year old.
3. softness, ""Soft martial arts"" sense, with redirection ect. Usually in the class everything is fine, we'll be running drills that involve partners blocking the other's punches etc, pretty standard stuff. But seriously, when a senior member of the class pulls me aside and tells me to ""not block so hard"" because I might ""hurt someone's hand"", that's kinda soft. That is literally the point of blocking excercises, and this was a 22 year old man complaining to a 17 year old

That said

Inner-peace (maybe with a side of meditation and self-control)

There are schools and organizations around the country that now offer a one week crash course in Krav, and then give that person a certification allowing them to teach as a ""level one instructor"". I believe subsequent levels can be achieved through other one week courses.

Is this not just a money grab for these organizations? You go train for a week, I'm not really sure if those affiliates have to pay some sort of royalties back once you bring your week's worth of Krav Training to a school and start teaching it.

By this I simply mean it seems like Krav Maga, at least the way it's taught around here, teaches just to disable your opponent and run away, which is good

This summer, and I was very much enjoying the new style and techniques. I didn't see the sword at all.

Yesterday, and had me try it as well (I was the only non-blackbelt there). He thoroughly baffled me with his very first words:

""You hold the sword here, don't do it.""

[EDIT: To avoid confusion

When I politely asked him about it later, which means I probably got the name wrong. I'll have to clarify with my Sensei, sorry about that]

It's been causing cognitive dissonance ever since. How am I supposed to react

1349110693.0,10rnpx,An funny story about the effectiveness of Tasers for self-defense.,specieshumanoid,36,19,16,"A funny story I came across about the effectiveness of Tasers for self-defense.

Need a laugh? Worth the read.........

Just try reading this without laughing till you cry!!!

Pocket Tazer Stun Gun
A guy who purchased his lovely wife a pocket Tazer for their anniversary submitted this:

Last weekend I saw something at Larry's Pistol &amp;amp; Pawn Shop that sparked my interest. The occasion was our 15th anniversary and I was looking for a little something extra for my wife Julie. What I came across was a 100

The effects of the Tazer were supposed to be short lived

WAY TOO COOL! Long story short, that if I pushed the button and pressed it against a metal surface at the same time, I'd get the blue arc of electricity darting back and forth between the prongs.

AWESOME!!! Unfortunately

Okay, right?

There I sat in my recliner

I must admit I thought about zapping Gracie (for a fraction of a second) and then thought better of it. She is such a sweet cat. But

Am I wrong?

So, and Tazer in another.

The directions said that:
a one-second burst would shock and disorient your assailant;

a two-second burst was supposed to cause muscle spasms and a major loss of bodily control; and

a three-second burst would purportedly make your assailant flop on the ground like a fish out of water.

Any burst longer than three seconds would be wasting the batteries.
All the while I'm looking at this little device measuring about 5"" long, and thinking to myself, 'no possible way!'

What happened next is almost beyond description

I'm sitting there alone,' reasoning that a one second burst from such a tiny lil ole thing couldn't hurt all that bad.. I decided to give myself a one second burst just for heck of it.

I touched the prongs to my naked thigh

HOLY MOTHER OF GOD. WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION. WHAT THE... !!!

I'm pretty sure Hulk Hogan ran in through the side door, over and over and over again. I vaguely recall waking up on my side in the fetal position, with tears in my eyes, body soaking wet, both nipples on fire, testicles nowhere to be found, with my left arm tucked under my body in the oddest position, clinging to a picture frame hanging above the fireplace

Note:
If you ever feel compelled to 'mug' yourself with a Tazer

There is NO such thing as a one second burst when you zap yourself! You will not let go of that thing until it is dislodged from your hand by a violent thrashing about on the floor!
A three second burst would be considered conservative!

A minute or so later (I can't be sure, sat up and surveyed the landscape.

My bent reading glasses were on the mantel of the fireplace.
The recliner was upside down and about 8 feet or so from where it originally was.
My triceps
My face felt like it had been shot up with Novocain
I had no control over the drooling.
Apparently I had crapped in my shorts
I saw a faint smoke cloud above my head

I'm still looking for my testicles and I'm offering a significant reward for their safe return!

PS: My wife can't stop laughing about my experience

But by the time I reached high school I got rather obsessed with martial arts and starting training every day, made friends, and to this day I am grateful for her insistence that I took it up.

In March, and was told that it would be somewhere around $450 out of pocket.  Apparently, insurance will not cover something like this.  That was way out of my price range, and I shelved the idea.  

For the past few months, but a lot less bank breaking.  It was okay at best, didn't really hold to my teeth, required me to constantly suck it back in place, and made talking a pain.  This is the standard experience that I have had with BNBs.

I went to the website, being the cheaper model, I could but it, and if I wanted the Elite later on, that more expensive model would be half off.  I had been considering buying two mouth guards and Gladiator customer service actually priced it this way, So if you order more than one, the more expensive will be 50% off.

I ordered the Pro, so you can understand how fast this happens.

On 5/22/13 (afternoon), but all of the packages for the process fit in the mail, so no running to the post office.

[The package](http://i.imgur.com/zHibDHSh.jpg) included two molds, and a self-addressed priority mail envelope.  Also, there was a slip of paper in the package if the mold tray did not fit on your back teeth.  It directed you to break off two small pieces on the tray in order for it to fit your mouth.  I had to do this for my molds, and it's not too much of a hassle.  Just check the tray beforehand.

Read the instructions before you do anything, I began to dread the idea of trying to measure this correctly.  Fortunately, when you open it up, you find that [it has already been split for you](http://i.imgur.com/LnXdqpZh.jpg).  Also, you need to refrigerate them for about an hour before you mix them (see why you read the instructions).

You knead the first halves with your fingers until it becomes a [light-blue, and hold it there until it hardens.  Instructions say it may take up to 8 minutes.  Mine was done around 4.  I recommend lying on your back as it makes it easier to swallow your saliva buildup.

Do this twice, and send it in the supplied envelope.

I mailed mine on 5/28/2013.


On 6/10/13 (approx 8-9 business days) I receive a n envelope in the mail.

I tried the mouthguard on

If you look at the top down pictures, There's a slightly harder outer surface (the black part), which I assumes gives it support as you mold it.  Unfortunately, with teh BNB, you always have this.

The Gladiator Pro fits EXCELLENTLY.  When I put it on

My only complaint at this time is that the front tooth of the mold chipped off in the mail.  I have emailed customer support

**EDIT  OP delivers.  Customer service emailed me back approximately an hour after my email.

Does anybody know of good schools in the Newton/Boston area a broke college student would be able to observe a class at during his free time? I want to make the most out of these observations

I don't have partners to spar with, or to hit mits with as I don't know many other people at my school who train martial arts. So this brings about my second question:

1325585816.0,o0yie,What rules and gear do you use in sparring?,phauna,18,1,80,"Most MAs have a sparring component.  Post here what your style is

In MMA at our gym we wear MMA open fingered gloves and mouthguards, groin strikes, small joint manipulation, head butts or eye pokes are allowed.  Slams and suplexes are allowed at low amplitude.  Elbows, stomping, soccer kicks and knees to the head on the ground are allowed at low force.  Striking power is agreed upon between students prior to sparring.  Striking on the ground is obviously allowed as well as in a clinch.

For wrestling every type of takedown is allowed but no grabbing the clothing.  Only low amplitude/ non-injurious suplexes and spiking are allowed.  The loser is the one pinned to their back for three seconds.  King of the hill between 3-4 people is the order of the day.  We generally just use mouthguards.

For BJJ/ submission wrestling it's the same as usual BJJ, as well as cranks and slices and such.  Tap to give up.  Just mouthguards.

MT/ standing striking is usually anything goes except headbutts, groin cups, elbow and shin guards are optional.

For the FMA (doce pares escrima) some people use WEKAF type stuff, stickfighting gloves and rattan sticks or blunt, wooden or foam knives.  We use lighter weight sticks sometimes.  Other times we use padded rattan sticks.  It's much more varied what people wear, some use knee and elbow guards like you get for roller skating, forearm guards, groin guards, varying helmets, unarmed strikes are allowed,False,

1. Who follows this way of anger and aggression to fuel your own progression?

2. Who follows the opposite of a calm

3. Do you like your way or would you rather change it?

EDIT:

Please read the article. The most outstanding sentence for me is:

&gt;Being capable of harnessing that intense feeling of contempt and then use anger and aggression as allies is the key to maximum productivity.

I'm not entirely happy with ""emotionless calm"" as the other side of the spectrum. I am however well aware that there are not only two discrete conditions but a continuous spectrum.

Anger/Aggression --------------------------0-------------------------- Calm/Emotionlessness

And everyone has a tendency towards one or the other. So far my assumptions

EDIT 2:

To clarify some things:

* Aggression in this context is only the aggression paired with anger. I used the words of the author

* this is not about me. I know which type I am

* I'm completely on the Calm side. I don't seek any advice or guidance. I'm fine

* ***The reason why I think this is worthy of discussion: there are enough people who do use and recommend usage of anger/hate towards people they know to push themselves when doing something hard.

1343106376.0,x24a8,Alright. I said I'd do it earlier. So here it is. Pressure point debate! Go!,Jenneh,23,7,101,"Not too long ago the video of the ""death touch"" was on here and many seemed to not like it. My question is why? Does it just look outlandish? Or have you tried it before? What is it about the pressure point arts that bothers you all? A few points here though.

* This is for the post itself. Im not here to say my martial art is better than your martial art. Im here to see why everyone denounces it and why (Id really rather you not just claim ""fake and gay""). I'm also not saying that you should solely rely on these arts in a fight..they just wouldn't stand up

* From the time that I spent in these arts I couldn't help but notice that pressure points are there, if you prefer..is needed. So, a right direction, and a right force is needed.

This is master higgenbotham. I've trained under him a few times. 

I think that I'm as skeptical as anyone out there

Its all debatable I guess. So go for it.

Edit 1: I created this post when I was dead tired last night. I looked for a video of Will Higgenbotham because I know him and just chose a video of him performing what many in this art practice. I personally don't like this video as much and I should have explained that. Not until I go back to try training at that dojo and ask to be knocked out will I take it as truth.

Edit 2: There is a certain ""mystic aspect"" to pressure points that seems to cause many to denounce it. In a way I see chi and energies as something like religion. It was a way to explain things things before science and a stronger knowledge of anatomical happenings came about to bring out what exactly is going on in the body. Don't go on me like ""Religions totally fake so that means that these pressure points are fake!""

Edit 3: How I see pressure points: AGAIN it doesn't stand up in a real fight if you RELY on these combos of points to try and take someone out. Theres a good time to use them and a bad time. The dojo I went to talked a lot about pressure points

Edit 4..: I think no touch is dumb. Thats where the..odd..fanatics come in.",,t5_2qkt4,1343146712.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/martialarts/comments/x24a8/alright_i_said_id_do_it_earlier_so_here_it_is/
