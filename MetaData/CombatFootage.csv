These videos are of real people who are risking their lives to fight for a cause that they believe is just. We should respect them when there is death portrayed instead of laughing it off as something normal. 

I am sure many of you haven't seen conflict first hand so I don't think you have a right to make fun of the people who choose to pick up arms to defend whatever they think its right. 

Anyways it should be noted in the rules that you should not ""glamorize war."" This means making fun of the death that is portrayed in the videos we watch.

1368911348.0,1elgnr,"An explanation of the Takbir ""Allahu Akbar""",tinkthank,336,70,105,"Quite often I see some incessant comments in this subreddit about what the term ""Allahu Akbar"" means

As a Muslim myself, itself, I wrote out a basic comprehensive explanation for this term. I apologize in advance for the wall of text. However, it is something that does requires detailed explanation and mind you, I pretty much scratched the surface in putting this together.

*Allahu Akbar/Allah Akbar/Allahu Achber* is most commonly known among Muslims as the “Takbir”. The term itself literally translates to “God is greater”

Most people in the West are aware of the Takbir through the videos you see online where a soldier or a fighter will shout “Allahu Akbar!” while firing his weapon against an enemy. It is most often mistakenly identified as a “war cry”. The term itself is well ingrained in Muslim culture and society. It is one of the most commonly used phrases among Muslims and is uttered primarily during the Salah or ritualistic prayer where Muslims face the Kaaba in Makkah. 

Theologically, which roughly translates to “there is no god (or divinity), except for God”. Islam prohibits attributing divine qualities to anyone or anything else aside from God. Even when praising someone, most Muslims will always attribute greatness to God in their speech. 

The term itself serves as a reminder for a Muslim, then it serves as a reminder that God is greater than everything and that your success and source of happiness comes from God. If you’re scared, then you say it as a reminder that God is indeed greater and that the only fear a Muslim should have is towards God. When a Muslim is angry, he says Allahu Akbar as a way of calming himself down, reminding that God is greater than anything that makes you angry, and turn to God for your solace. 

While in the West, most Muslims would shout the Takbir in unison as a way of showing approval and praise to a speaker. Though, many Muslims have adopted the tradition of clapping their hands, many will still shout the Takbir while clapping.

*Examples:*
“Allahu Akbar! Nick is a great speaker!”
“SubhanAllah (Glorious is God)! This scenery looks amazing!” 
“Alhamdulillah (Praises to God)! I studied hard and I passed my exams!”
“InshAllah (God willing) we will catch the train on time”

These terms (and a few more) are collectively called Dhikr (Remembrance). Dhikr is an extremely important aspect of Islam. 

&gt;Mu’adh ibn Jabal said

 -Sunan At-Tirmidhi, Hasan.

Muslims incorporate Dhikr in their prayer as well as in their daily life, he kept whispering “Allahu Akbar” to himself. 

The Takbir isn’t necessarily confined to Islam. Allah is the Arabic word for God. Many Arab Christians refer to God as “Allah”, despite the majority of the inhabitants of Malta are Catholic and European. 

One of the most famous singers in the Middle East, had her hit song, “Ya oum Allah!” which is a Christian hymn:
 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjsvoCoXszQ

Videos of Muslims chanting the Takbir in Makkah during the Eid prayer:

Edit: wouldn't mind other Arabic speakers or Muslims to chime in as well.

This video was posted here on Combat Footage and here is the [post](http://www.reddit.com/r/CombatFootage/comments/19wt45/truck_bomb_hits_ana_base_in_wardak/).  

Except the video was deleted on [Liveleak](http://www.liveleak.com/view?i=51a_1362745181). Also multiple mirrors were also deleted from Youtube.

I tried searching everywhere and this [forum discussion video](http://www.xerq.net/showthread.php?24070-Video-of-a-truck-bomb-hitting-ANA-base-in-Wardak) was also deleted.  

Here is a [BBC news article](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-south-asia-14871666) regarding the event. Here is pictures of the [aftermath of the explosion](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2036117/Afghanistan-Taliban-suicide-bomber-truck-attack-injures-80-US-soldiers.html)   

Why was this video deleted and does anyone happen to know where I could find it? (I am very bad at reddit formatting)

The reason I am searching for this video is because that video showed the power of a truck bomb filled with up to 9 tons of explosives. I currently live and work in Kabul and on [March 15th 2013](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-21798696)

Interesting article about Syria and how to form a Battalion. It should provide us with some insights into the videos we are seeing.

They talk about how they are paid to provide videos by Gulf backers. How they smuggle weapons. How they pressured the Saudis to pressure the Americans to allow Turkey to supply them with heavy weapons. About the troubles between the Rebel groups. The Libyan arms market. The increase of Jihadis and that they are better supported.

**Footage:**   [Так погибали в Чечне. Январь 1995 г.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=VCdqWdKP_xo)


**Dialogue:**
&gt;**Narrator:** Our Operator Valentine Janus and two VDV officer guides set out to the Presidential Palace

&gt;**VDV Guide:** You have to run across while ducking and with pace.

&gt;**Journalist:** Zigzaging?

&gt;**Guide:** No need to zigzag just duck and run.

&gt;*Inaudible* *Guide Runs across the road*

&gt;**Guide 2:** Was that (shooting) at you?

&gt;**Guide 1:** Nah

&gt;*Shooting* *Journalist and Guide 2 run across*

&gt;----Film Cuts To them near a Brick Wall.----

&gt;**Guide 1:** We will stand here, we can be safe all the way up to the first Shilka (Mobile AA), but after that its completely fucked.

&gt;**Journalist:** From where can we see the Parliament Building

&gt;**Guides:** You can’t see it from here

&gt;**Journalist:** Is that 5 storey ours?

&gt;**Guide 2:** Ours. Yeah must be ours.

&gt;**Journalist:** Ok

&gt;**Guide 1:** From those buildings

&gt;*Guide 1 Runs along the side of the building

&gt;-----Scene Cut Next to Shilka-----

&gt;**Guide 1 (to driver):** Can you move up and give us cover while we cross?

&gt;**Guide 2:** He cant get through there is a tree

&gt;*Shilka moves a few feet* *Inaudible speak*

&gt;**Guide 1:** Look, three BMPs taken out all next to each other. They got whole coulumn.

&gt;----Scene Cut Next Further Down the Street---

&gt;*Tanks shooting* “Maybe we get higher up?” *They run across open ground to hide behind the BMP*

&gt;**Guide1:** Ok here we can go inside see the wounded

&gt;**Journalist:** Lets go have a look.

&gt;**Guide1:** Wait

&gt;*They run inside*

&gt;**Guide:** Are there wounded here or have they got picked up already.

&gt;**Soldiers:** Most gone

&gt;**Guide 1:** One wounded?

&gt;**Soldiers:** Yes one. *Inaudible*

&gt;**Guide:** Where were you hit?

&gt;**Soldier:** In the arm

&gt;**Guide:** In the arm? When?

&gt;**Soldier:** Yesterday

&gt;**Guide:** Lunch time? Why are you not evacuated?

&gt;**Soldier:** It took a long time to break out from the encirclement

&gt;**Guide:** Where were you sitting?

&gt;**Soldier:** In the 9-storey

&gt;**Guide:** You from the 6th company? Ah you are airborne?

&gt;**Soldier:** Yes

&gt;----Scene Cut To Outside Behind BMP----

&gt;**Guide:** Yeah

&gt;**Guide2:** Whack them from the tank until the whole tower comes down.

&gt;**Guide1:** Ok

&gt;**Journalist:** And then we go around from the right?

&gt;**Guide1:** Ill show you when we get to that shed. (To soldier) Hey

&gt;*They run across past the shed to a squad crouching behind armour.* “More wounded inside”

&gt;**Journalist (To platoon commnder):** Hello

&gt;-----Cut to view from window----

&gt;**Journalist:** That one is ours? (Big white tower block)

&gt;**Gunner:** Should be ours, constantly the Chechen's keep retaking it and we keep burning them out. The airborne takes it, then at night the Chechen's return to upper floors and start wasting us with RPG's and hand grenades, then they get driven back. It seems the airborne is holding it again. From that white house and from the palace there is constant machine gun fire, and the this whole area is open to it. No matter how much we keep blowing them away, with underbarrel grenades and machine guns, its no use. That’s the conference center, from there my BMP was hit, they hit an APC there, it’s a shit view though.

&gt;**Journalist:** Nah

&gt;**Gunner:** Yeah from that house there is constant sniper and RPG fire. Well what can I say…at least we aren't bored here.

&gt;*Tries to cock machinegun*

&gt;**Gunner:** Ah this fucking thing is getting on my nerves already *Machinegun Fire*

&gt;------Scene Cut to outside the building------Journalist standing next to Guide1

&gt;**Guide1:**We are standing here on- near the Rosa-Luxemburg street.

&gt;**Journalist:** Are we both in the shot? (Yeah) Well thanks to this commander (Guide1) Sasha is his name

&gt;**Guide1:** Deputy commander

&gt;**Journalist:** Well all these points which I have got through in Grozny today, but for me they seemed hot. It is my first time in this type of surroundings, its hard, scary, but Im proud that we have soldiers like this.

&gt;-----Scene Cut To Them Navigating Streets-----

&gt;**Narrator:** Just a few minutes afterwards

&gt;**Guide1:** We will stop by that BMP, because there is a little hill. Get down behind the hill. We talk there.

&gt;**Journalist:** Ok

&gt;**Guide2:** Duck! Duck!

&gt;*1st bullet wounds Journalist

&gt;*Guides run up to him

&gt;*2nd bullet hits Journalist*

&gt;**Journalist:** He killed me. He killed me. Damn

&gt;**Guide1:** Where

&gt;**Journalist:** I’ll run by myself.

&gt;**Guide1:** Where are you hit?

&gt;**Journalist:** Ill run over there

&gt;**Journalist:** We must run. We must get out of here.

&gt;*3rd Bullet hits Journalist*

&gt;**Journalist:** Aiii

&gt;*Guide 1 is killed*  
_________________________________________________________________________

During the first Chechen war (94'-96') 20 journalists were killed , 9 are missing to this day. These men were well aware of the risks. We should never take for granted *what* it takes to bring footage out of a war zone and into the public's eyes. Nor should we take for granted the nature of war and all of those it affects. To us who weren't there we should be objective and open minded as possible when viewing such material because there is nothing we can add to what happened all we can do is learn from it.",,False,self,t5_2v0c6,1352093827.0,,

/r/CombatFootage is a fantastic subreddit, that is a great thing, providing more content, and the potential for more discussion and information in the comments.

Anyone who has been a Reddit user for a significant amount of time has probably seen comments or posts to the effect of ""there is an inverse relationship between number of subscribers, the quality goes down"".  In this case, I think /r/CombatFootage will have an easier time than most, as there are only video or self posts, and pretty much everyone agrees that HD videos, ones providing a new perspective, or ones that are especially raw or informative are what makes a quality submission.

However one area that deserves attention is the type of comments that become prevalent with higher numbers of subscribers.  In my opinion (I don't have data to back this up), and complaints about [""Allah Akbars""](http://www.reddit.com/r/CombatFootage/comments/1a7s7u/libyan_war_tank_explosion_possibly_internal/c8uwrc6) are steadily increasing.

This kind of content strays from the original purpose of the subreddit:

&gt;This forum is a discussion ground for battle footage from historical and ongoing conflicts.

&gt;Please be objective when labeling a title or commenting as this is a non biased forum. We ask that you maintain a civilized dialogue. No Glamorizing war.

In my opinion, /r/askscience, and /r/MorbityReality are notable examples.

Here are the portions of the rule sets from /r/science and /r/MorbidReality

S:

&gt;Please ensure that your comment on an r/science thread is:

&gt;on-topic and relevant to the submission.

&gt;not a joke, these will be removed.

&gt;not hateful, or otherwise unacceptable.

MR:

&gt;
1. Humor dedicated to the expense of someone's pain is strictly prohibited. There are many other subreddits listed below in the sidebar that welcome brash humor.

&gt;2. Refrain from promoting hate speech, religion-bashing, and any other abusive/threatening language. ""Abusive language"" includes posts which are malicious or insulting in nature.

I personally would like to see a similar definition of the rules for this subreddit, and gain a perspective on a type of existence that most people in the western world hopefully never experience first-hand.

What do you guys think?

GENEVA | Sun May 5

(Reuters) - U.N. human rights investigators have gathered testimony from casualties of Syria's civil war and medical staff indicating that rebel forces have used the nerve agent sarin

The United Nations independent commission of inquiry on Syria has not yet seen evidence of government forces having used chemical weapons

""Our investigators have been in neighboring countries interviewing victims, there are strong, concrete suspicions but not yet incontrovertible proof of the use of sarin gas, from the way the victims were treated,"" Del Ponte said in an interview with Swiss-Italian television.

""This was use on the part of the opposition,"" she added, speaking in Italian.

Del Ponte

The Geneva-based inquiry into war crimes and other human rights violations is separate from an investigation of the alleged use of chemical weapons in Syria instigated by U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon

President Bashar al-Assad's government and the rebels accuse each another of carrying out three chemical weapon attacks, and another in Homs in December.

The civil war began with anti-government protests in March 2011. The conflict has now claimed an estimated 70

The United States has said it has ""varying degrees of confidence"" that sarin has been used by Syria's government on its people.

President Barack Obama last year declared that the use or deployment of chemical weapons by Assad would cross a ""red line"".

&gt; **Correcting mistakes**

&gt;May 22

&gt;Last year, no matter. A short clash - all three are bodies. And then looking at one of the corpses an operative says, ""Looks like, Mutaliev"". Well, the press-service told reporters that one of them preliminarily identified as Mutaliev. What journalists have written, I do not know, but militants' websites got really excited and started yelling, what a blessing, turn inside out (like we are terrorists, and issue it as their own information. In short

&gt;But yesterday we corrected. And, but still no command to attack. It turned out that the leadership did not want to risk their neighbors, and it turned out that there is a woman in the house with the child. It is unlikely that Mutaliev comes out with his hands up - he's got a life sentence waiting for him. In short, it is clear that there will be shooting, but it is necessary to evacuate neighbors and a woman with a child needs to get out of the house. Waited for the dawn. Evacuated neighbors. The negotiator convinced the bandits to release a woman with a baby. Then tried to persuade the second militant (the husband of the woman, I think Ozdoev) to surrender. I do not know the details of the conversation, but in the end they opened fire. Oh
The corpse mishap is corrected.

&gt;Here's the raid footage

edit:

Mutaliev was a high-ranking member. Right under Doku Umarov.

While much of the footage we see is captured by bystanders and fighters there remain the war correspondents who deliberately go into harms way to bring back images so that the public may see for themselves what  circumstances people face in war torn countries.

This thread is for sharing the names and works of these brave people for without their efforts there will be no light cast onto some of the darkest moments in our history.

Unfortunately

""It's a bit too long (30 minutes). But basically it's the video shot by a press officer who gets send from St. Petersburg. They are not Spetsnaz or even Army they are a special police force.

March 4th (4:00 - 9:40) a BTR hit an anti-tank mine in front of their base. They move out but are afraid of the ""ghosts"" in the buildings. They call the Chechen fighters ""ghosts"" because you don't see them but they are always there. At around 6:00 they are at the hit BTR. At 8:30 one of the guys says that they saw a 12 year old boy that day and suspect he was the one placing the mine. Shortly after that they've captured one of those ""ghosts"". At 9:20 the wounded guy hears that the driver (he had lost his legs) died in the hospital.

9:40 they are leaving Grozny for a raid against illegal refineries. Later you see them destroying one. At around 11:00 you see a burning oil well and an attempt to extinguish the fire.

11:45 (March 1st) they sit in the press officer room.

12:22 (March 6th) a huge attack in Grozny with fighters everywhere (100s or thousands). A Chechen police unit is under attack and they are send out to support them. They've already send out two BTRs and he missed them. Which turns out was lucky for him because at 13:30 they reach a bridge and see that the other BTRs below them have been ambushed. They want to reach their comrades and try do desperately call the Army to send helicopters (14:40) to drop a smoke screen. But the Army says the weather it too bad to fly helicopters and thus they move their BTRs on the bridge at 15:00.

At 16:00 they show video made at the same time by the guys assistant at their home base. They are attacked as well. Meanwhile they run towards the ambushed BTRs and he breaks his camera.

But at 17:00 he fixes the camera and shows the only three survivors. They complain that the army did not support them and the Russian media tries to make it look like peace and doesn't show the truth and that the politicians send them to die and drive big cars. They lost their commander and five or six soldiers.

Videos from different days: 18:51 a raid in a village 40 km outside of Grozny. At 19:55 they hear a shot and arrest a man. At 20:50 the women of the village complain and they move out. At 21:22 they get ambushed from the woods. They wait and the attackers withdraw after a while. 21:57 they show arrested ""ghosts"" being mistreated by the special police. He says that mistreatment was not common and a rare occasion but this happened shorty after they lost some friends.

22:47 (March 7th) they had to sleep at an Army base because they couldn't make it back to their base after the BTR rescue. They move out to the ambush place to look for other survivors and get the bodies. An army officer sends two tanks to support them despite this request being denied by higher authorities. At 23:36 they are at the old ambush place from March 6th. They have dogs to sniff out if the bodies have been booby trapped. The tanks shoot at the ruined buildings to protect against potential sharp shooters.

At 25:22 (Martch 8th) they are still at the Army base and drink vodka.

26:00 (Marth 9th) they drive back to their home base. Then he tells a story that he was in Grozny as a young recruit 16 years before that and the locals were very nice to him. On his last evening buying him food and drinks in a small pub and giving him flowers for his mother or girlfriend.""

Episodes: 

**The Aggression**

**The Crushing Defeat**

**Shock**

**The Turning Point**

**The Great Landing**

**The End of the Nightmare.**

*from http://topdocumentaryfilms.com/apocalypse-the-second-world-war/*
&gt;Thanks to the efforts of a few, restored and made available by National Geographic Channel in an extraordinary six-part series: Apocalypse: The Second World War. In addition to stunning footage, the series presents WWII in an innovative and provocative way, giving audiences an unprecedented sense of the reality of war not conveyed by black and white footage.

&gt;Made up entirely of original 35mm, the evacuation of the British Expeditionary Force at Dunkirk, the inhumane treatment of French soldiers taken prisoner by the Nazis and the sacrifice of Soviet soldiers at Stalingrad.

&gt;By bringing this incredible footage together

&gt;This documentary was made available on TDF thanks to a regular visitor Dai Evans. It’s with excellent quality and as far as I can tell is the only one on the web so far.
