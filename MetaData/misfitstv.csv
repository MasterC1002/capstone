1. Howard Overman. He is still in charge. He created the original cast that we all grew to love

2. Remember series one? There was no real direction. No over-arching plot. Just 6 stories about a handful of fuck-ups with super powers. It wasn't until series two when the ""Superhoodie time loop"" arc was established, we're back at the beginning.  A reintroduction of the show and its new characters. By the end of this series, I think we'll all have grown attached to our new gang, and series 5 will establish a new over-arching plot. 

3. The Storm. It's a great premise. A freak storm that turns your deepest insecurities and defining flaws into superpowers. It's fucking brilliant! The formula for this show has the potential for dozens of interesting characters and unique stories for a long long time. There are rumors of an American spin-off of Misfits where the storm happens to a bunch of different kids in the US. I think that's an awesome idea! (I'd hate to see an awful TV-14 Robert Sheehan impression

4. You can't blame the showrunners for the departure of (most) our characters. Robert Sheehan thought he was going to be a huge movie star. He *wanted* to leave Misfits. Now that all of his movies have bombed, the whole crew would have stayed together, but it didn't work out that way. We have to move on. There ain't no happy endings.

Finn used his power like 4 times in the entire season and half of those times it didn't do shit. And Jess's power only came to use in the first and last episode. Curtis revived one person and i think 2nd Rudy's appearances also became more rare. Oh yeah

1. **Curtis' Death** - Incidentally, when Curtis placed the gun to his temple I would have liked a quick flashback clip of him winning a race or spending some time with Nikki. It would have just added more depth to the scene. Other than that, brilliant. 

2. **No Finn/Jess Love Story** - I loved the characters

3. **No Alex** - Got to say

4. **Abby** - Now, unnecessary and pretty poorly acted. I always cringe at that part in the seventh episode when she snaps 'I don't know who I am!' Poorly delivered. 

5. **More Reference to the old gang** - Yeah

6. **Seth** - Not much to go on this

Recap: Curtis is bitten by one of the zombies that he resurrected to find out about Lola and in the end kills himself. 
The ending of this episode broke my heart.  It's the 4th season and Simon went back in time/is dead, crude, tattooed, and a sexual deviant but we see more of his human side as he realizes what his only living or present friend must do to save them from an apocalypse. Rudy doesn't cry in front of his new friends because he realizes that they will need a ""leader"" since Curtis is now dead and he was obviously the more level-headed and strong one. Rudy knows what must be done but he's still heartbroken, but not completely broken. I loved this, the writers did a good job and this part for me redeemed season 4 and has given me more hope for the show.  The torch from the original characters has been passed down and Rudy must take care of the others.

They never show him giving up the power to see into the future, and hadn't witnessed the second one (if memory serves me). Because of this, he sees the future that Curtis erased where the milk man murders everybody. So, he knows it must be prevented. This means he would have allowed the video game guy to kill Nathan and believe he was the undercover cop since Nathan was immortal and it would cause the video game guy to continue on to the 'next level' without chasing and killing Alisha. That means the milk guy timeline would have proceeded as normal, giving him the news footage, and then he could travel back in time with the news footage. After that, he would have continued into the timeline we see in the show, then jumping down to take the bullet for her.

The main thing is, since he still has the money and clothes when he travels back at the finale of season 3.

The interesting powers stuff is gone. The characters I know are all gone. I give no shits about the new characters except Rudy. I don't care if the bar guy is gay. What the heck...

1355962164.0,154zk1,My thoughts on season 4 of Misfits (SPOILERS),brrrgandy,1,1,0,"     So I just finished watching the last episode of season 4 and my reaction is what the fuck. That was one 

helluva anticlimactic episode. There was so much wrong this season; I don't even know where to start. Let's talk 

about their powers. The previous seasons were about these delinquents ending up with some powers and how 

they cope with it and the shenanigans they get in for abusing their powers. It was so much more entertaining 

and you get to see into the characters. Unlike now where the new cast just happen to run into random people 

with powers and random shit happens and they don't even use their powers (like the stupid killer rabbit episode). 

It just feels so much more shallow and the new characters are unlikable to me.
 

     Then there was the reason for their powers. I loved how the in original cast

because of their personalities. Simon felt invisible and has invisibility

people into horndogs

was conscious of what everyone around her thought of her so she could read minds

Nathan was I'm not sure

them.
 

     Another thing wrong with the last episode was Rudy and Nadine. Was it just me or did the relationship felt 

incredibly forced? They met for what? 5 minutes? at a funeral? and they fall deeply in love? (If only it was that 

easy). Then Rudy just goes on and on about Nadine after that. It just didn't seem right.
 

    Then there was the four horsemen OF THE APOCALYPSE. It looked like four kids on a bmx bike with swords. It 

felt like their whole existence

the previous season. They could have done so much more with that


     The best episode this season was Curtis episode and it felt kind of like the show died along with him. It 

was sad

community service? And I also like the new probation worker

end of my rant. I miss Nathan, Simon, and Kelly :(, but I understand it changes sometimes for the 

better or worse. I'll watch season 5 to see if they can do anything interesting like the beginning.
