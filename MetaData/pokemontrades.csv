***cryo's Trading Guide For Beginners***

------------------------------------------------------------

Hey you.  Yeah, you've simply got to be informed about the whole process.  You've got to know what's worth what in order to make the most out of your trades.  And be patient.  You're not going to go from nothing to everything in a week unless you cheat.  And cheaters suck, so don't cheat bro (or lady bro).  But don't worry.  I'm here to give you some (maybe) helpful tips to get you started.

------------------------------------------------------------

**HOW TO TRADE**  (this portion of the guide courtesy of Hypobasis)

First off

* Using the GTS

* Using r/pokemontrades

Both require you to have a WiFi connection to connect to. The WiFi needs to be secured with WEP encryption or no encryption at all (unsecured). However

So
DSi and DSi XL support WEP

If you own an older model, your best bet is to head to a starbucks or McDonald's and take advantage of the free wifi they have.
Next, follow this guide.
Right, you wanted a Magikarp and your offering a Elekid. So, in r/pokemontrades, you'd click ""Submit a link"" and change to the ""text"" tab. Next, you'd in the title box, you'd put the generation your game is.

The reason we need to do this is because 4th generation games are incompatible with 5th generation games. That way we don't get confused on what game your trading for.

If your game is Diamond, Heart Gold, or Soul Silver, your game is a 4th generation game.

If your game is Black, or White 2, your game is a 5th generation game.

 So, offering Elekid"".

Then, and use ""register friend code"" to add the other guy to your friend code list.

Finally, in 5th gen games you head upstairs. Talk to the lady in the middle, who asks you if you want to go into the Wi-Fi club. Agree, save and enter the wi-fi club. Run up to the TV on the opposite end of the room and press A, set your status to ""Trade"" and wait till your partner goes online and accepts your invite. After that, it's fairly self explanatory.
If your buddy is online
That's all it takes! Happy trading!

------------------------------------------------------------

***Value Tiers*** *(A loose guide.  Not to be taken as Law)*

* Tier 1: Shiny Events.  (Old Sea Map Mew, Newmoon Island Darkrai, Ranger Manaphy)  Hard to determine Legitimacy.  Only trade with trusted users.

* Tier 1.5: Super Rare Events.  Mostly very old in-person limited and mostly foreign events.  Stuff like Space C Deoxys and other rare Gen 3 and Early Gen 4 events go here.  Like Tier 1 stuff

* Tier 2: Rare Events.  Mostly in-person stuff.  The older and more limited in distrobution

* Tier 3: Shiny Legends.  The in-game stuff.  People's value on these vary a lot.  Can be relatively simple to obtain if you are talented at RNG.  Gen 3/4 stuff is usually worth a little more than Gen 5.

* Tier 4: Regular Events.  All other events.  Most all wifi events go here.  Stuff that's widely available.  The more recent and more available, the two are not equal in value, and you probably won't find anyone willing to do a 1:1 trade.)

* Tier 5: Breedable Shinies.

**----MASSIVELY HUGE VALUE DROP----**

* Tier 6: Dream World Legends

* Tier 6.5: In-game Legends

* Tier 7: DWF Breedables [*Currently Available DW Pokemon*](http://www.smogon.com/forums/threads/list-of-released-dream-world-pokemon-mark-ii.3454925/)

* Tier 8: Standard breedables.

**The RNG FACTOR** - As far as RNGed stuff goes

No quantity of T6-T8 is really worth anything above to most users.  One item from any tier is worth approximately 2-3 from the tier below (again, they're broken down that way because I've seen stuff traded 1:1 between them in some cases.  And 2:1 from a half tier for the tier above might be overpaying in most cases.  As an example, I've seen trades where someone might trade 1 from Tier 1.5 and 1 from tier 2 or 3 for a Tier 1.  And even within the same tiers, like I mentioned in Tier 4, there is often a lot of gap in value, to where a 1:1 trade within the tier isn't really fair.  This is something that you'll just have to pick up on over time, and not really something I can feasibly lay out in a guide like this.

Obviously in the end, these tiers are only meant to be helpful guidelines, not strict rules.  Just don't be dissapointed because no one wants to trade their Mew for your Cobalion.  Just do some reasearch on events and watch other trade threads, and you'll easily start to pick up on the proper values of things.

Outside of that

***ALL POKEMON FROM TIER 5 AND UP ARE REQUIRED TO BE POKECHECKED TO BE TRADED ON /R/POKEMONTRADES***  [Find out how to do this here.](http://www.reddit.com/r/pokemontrades/comments/1jg6mx/announcement_how_to_use_pok%C3%A9check_a_quick_guide/)

------------------------------------------------------------

**A Note on Gen 3 Events:**  As several users have pointed out, and make sure you trust the person offering them.  Don't be afraid to ask in the pokecheck shoutbox for a second opinion on legitimacy.

A similar caution should be used around Shiny Events/Legends.  There are a few ways to spot hacks that appear legal at first glance

------------------------------------------------------------

**Bartering** - Honestly, if you're taking offers, don't necessarily just jump on every good offer.  If you reject an offer, they'll either up it (since they followed my advice and lowballed you), or they'll give up.  You can always go back and accept the original offer though if this happens.  Like anything else, it just takes practice.  And to really effectively barter, you've got to have a really good grip on what stuff is worth.

***SUPER PRO TIP*** - Be nice to people, son.

------------------------------------------------------------

Overall, they're just trade fodder. They're your new currency.) Then wait another couple months and try trading another batch. Except now chances are better that more people may want one if they missed the event, and now you have some other events and shinies to throw in the mix to trade up the ladder. Keep repeating this process over the next year or two, and you should have yourself a pretty awesome collection. I know that's not the answer you wanted to hear, but like anything, a (legit) pokemon collection takes time and effort to obtain.

Another shorter-term option would be to learn how to RNG shinies

Basically it seems that recently people have not been making the best judgement with trades. For example I think we all need to really think about what would constitute a ""fair"" trade. The most erroneous example of this seems to be people offering in-game shinies (LoR Gyarados, but can it be considered reddiquette not to even offer them?

My next point is over the actual rules themselves. It seems that recently several traders here are disregarding them. In the last few days here I've seen a few being broken. 

-No Giveaways.

-Post a Pokecheck.

-Use proper post formats.

For the first one, but /r/Pokemongiveaway is where that should happen. It just clogs up the front page to do it.

As for posting a pokecheck, and there is a guide on the Pokecheck home page. The excuse ""I don't have a Pokecheck because I don't know how"" doesn't work. If you really do need more help, simply ask a question and the people here would be willing to help you.

Finally, it only takes a second to check what formatted heading you need. Heck, I was going to use [Meta] as my format until I checked to see what I could use. It's not hard and it makes the front page look cleaner. 

As a final note I just want to say that nothing I have mentioned is the mod's fault. I know a lot of the mods here work behind the scenes to keep this place running great. Really what we have to remember is that the mods are the authority in this community, we can make /r/pokemontrades a community we all can enjoy.

**Step 1**: Download the Desmume emulator WIFI edition.  
**Step 2**: Get it set up with the proper BIOS and firmware files. You'll have to google this yourself
**Step 3**: Download a ROM of the Pokemon version you own (technically this isn't illegal
**Step 4**: Start a new game on it and get up to the point where you can trade on the GTS/WFC. Alternatively
**Step 5**: Ensure that you actually can trade on the GTS
**Step 6**: Register the friend codes of your legit game (the one with the event pokemon on it) and the emulator game.    

Right

**Step 7**: Trade your event pokemon to the emulator game in the WiFi Club room (the middle one in B/W/B2/W2).  
**Step 8: BACKUP THE SAVE FILE. It now has your event pokemon
**Step 9**: Use a save file editor such as Pokegen to extract it as a pkm file.  
**Step 10**: Upload it to Pokecheck.

1372714020.0,1hgbdp,"A community discussion regarding the [Question] of Legality, Illegality, and Legitimacy.",cryophantom,37,99, the main comment thread [can be read here.](http://www.reddit.com/r/pokemontrades/comments/1hdctg/question_farming_and_legality/cat94z6)  

Basically, and Illegal means in regards to pokemon being traded here.  He laid down his personal interpretation of the rules as law, despite there being no clear definitions anywhere on this page.  The rule on the sidebar simply states the following:

* *Trading Hacked

No explanations, as judging by the PM responses I got last night and the upvoting/downvoting of my discussion with the mod, I believe my stance is the one held by the vast majority of this community.

Defining Legality:

* A pokemon shall be considered legal if it has no clear signs of being hacked or edited.  Legal pokemon will have no red flags on pokecheck, speak to the source of the pokemon.

Defining Legitimacy:

* A pokemon shall be considered legit if and only if it checks as legal and the *source* of said pokemon is the original and intended source.  An event pokemon will be considered legit if it comes from a *unique* wondercard downloaded from an official Nintendo source (Nintendo WFC

Breaking down Illegality:

* **Hacks** - Any pokemon that does not originate from the original, pokemon edited by 3rd party software, and illegal wondercards.  Abusing saves to re-use wondercards is illegal (be it on a rom or retail).  Some hacks can look 100% legal.

* **Clones** - Any pokemon that is not the original

Now, as they are 100% generated by your game.  Some people prefer not to use them though, as they feel that it goes against the original, or pure, intent of the game.  And its fully everyone's right to decide that for themselves.  The solution developed for this sub was simply that any RNGed pokemon offered for trade need to be identified as such.  As a solution to this current issue, I propose a new rule be added that states if a pokemon being offered for trade comes from a rom, it needs to be identified as such so people can decide for themselves whether they want to trade or not.

So that's what I've got.  If you agree with what I've said, let your voice be heard as well!  I've been a part of many different gaming communities over the years, and all that were successful were communities governed by and for the people.  MrJAPoe said in our discussion yesterday that he does listen to the community, so I truly hope that whatever the consensus is here is what will be officially enforced, even if it goes against his personal preferences.  And if it is decided that I am in the wrong and am in fact a dirty rotten hacker, I will accept the community's decision and take my leave.

*edit for typos.

*edit2 for some additional thoughts:

Some people seem to

While it is true that many methods of manipulation and cheating are made easier through the use of flashcarts, plenty of illegitimate pokemon are also created on retail carts through various methods.  Similarly, legitimate pokemon can be obtained on both flashcarts and retail carts when holding to the definitions outlined above.

This confusion serves to highlight the most crucial part of my definition of legitimacy

1308153214.0,i0dto,a note on exotic/rare trades (like Shiny's or Event's),Hypobasis,35,0,16,"Since we had a scammer a while back scam a user out of a shiny Vulpix

When your making an exotic trade, you need to give a pokecheck report of the new Pokemon. 

**Why do you need to do this?**

* It proves that you actually have said Pokemon
* It allows people who want to trade with you to see exactly what they are getting
* It allows everyone to see a legality analysis of said Pokemon.

It's not perfect

* Note, but feel free to do so if you want.

**For those of you who've never used Pokecheck:**

PokeCheck is a stat checker that works as if it's the GTS. It allows you to see ALL of the pokemon stats. It works by ""uploading"" your pokemon to a fake GTS and reading all the data as it goes through.

Your Pokemon doesn't actually leave your game (the server ""rejects"" the Pokemon) so there's no need to worry about having your Pokemon stolen or anything.

**How do do a Pokecheck Analysis?**

* First

* Load up your save and talk to the lady on the far right of the second floor of the PokeCenter

* This will start up the GTS, like a level 0 -9 Charizard or something, that way if it does upload your Pokemon to the real GTS it will be unlikely that someone will take it right away.

* If all goes well, you either have a hacked pokemon, or have a pokemon that has a name with a profane word in it (Corafagious actually counts for this, you have to nickname him in order to upload him to the GTS).

* Assuming you got error 66

* You should now see your pokemon on that list

* At the bottom of the pokemons page

EDIT: Update, the screenshot alone will suffice.

* Finally

**Example**


For example

*Offering Shiny Groudon*

Hey dudes

Here's the [Pokecheck Analysis](http://pokecheck.kraftpaper.org/?p=detail&amp;uid=119461) and [here's](http://i.imgur.com/vdoCu.png) the legality analysis.


**What should I be looking at in a Analysis?**

* First, all that jazz. Also, check to see if the font match up. Use my links above as a template, that's what the font SHOULD look like.

* On the Pokemon page, be sure to check the OT's trainer ID and game against the ones you see on that list. Use mine as an example, there are a few ""Hiro's"" from diamond and pearl anda  few of them have uploaded hacked pokemon, but none from emerald like my groudon.

* Finally

**The person offering a shiny didn't do a Analysis

Plain and simple: Don't make any offers until they do one. Demand one in the comments.

The person may have not see the warnings or something

If they constantly refuse to do a Analysis

**Final Notes:**

1300749668.0,g8io8,[Guide] Quick guide to trading in both the 4th and 5th generations.,Hypobasis,40,5,14,"Hey guys

First off

* Using the GTS
* Using r/pokemontrades

Both require you to have a WiFi connection to connect to. The WiFi needs to be secured with **WEP** encryption or no encryption at all (unsecured). However

So

* Original Model DS and DS lite only support open connections and wep connections
* DSi and DSi XL support WEP

If you own an older model, your best bet is to head to a starbucks or McDonald's and take advantage of the free wifi they have.

Next, follow [this](http://www.nintendo.com/consumer/wfc/en_na/ds/connect.jsp) guide.

Right, you wanted a Magikarp and your offering a Elekid. So, in r/pokemontrades, you'd click ""Submit a link"" and change to the ""text"" tab. Next, you'd in the title box, you'd put the generation your game is.

The reason we need to do this is because 4th generation games are incompatible with 5th generation games. That way we don't get confused on what game your trading for.

If your game is:

* Diamond
* Pearl
* Platinum
* HeartGold
* SoulSilver

Your game is a **4th** generation game.

If your game is:

* Black
* White

Your a 5th generation game. So, offering Elekid"".

Then, and use ""register friend code"" to add the other guy to your friend code list.

Finally, in 5th gen games you head upstairs. Talk to the lady in the middle, who asks you if you want to go into the Wi-Fi club. Agree, save and enter the wi-fi club. Run up to the TV on the opposite end of the room and press A, set your status to ""Trade"" and wait till your partner goes online and accepts your invite. After that, it's fairly self explanatory.

1 - **Pokechecks!**As the address bar says

* ''It has a ribbon and can't be checked'' WRONG. There are users who can post pokechecks of your events, /u/DevinXtreme and /u/PlUmPaSsChIcKeN. They are not always around and are busy themselves, so they can't get a check all the time. However, not posting pokechecks is against the rules. Alternatively, if you agree to a trade where you didn't ask for a pokecheck, don't be surprised if you get a hacked pokemon.

* ''I have a bad internet connection'' I just won't accept this at all.

* Pokemon like events  (Mew, Keldeo, Jirachi etc) must have pokechecks, as do shinies and DW starters. No exceptions. Do not post imgur checks if you can avoid them. The people who check events may keep them on pokecheck for a limited amount of time. I personally don't accept imgur checks. It's easy to edit a photo that's screen capped and HAS happened before. 

2 - **Even trades!** I have seen a couple people trying to get events for their Phiones. PHIONE IS NOT A LEGENDARY. It is a breedable pokemon and I have/had about 3 boxes of them at one stage. Manaphy though

Shinies go for other shinies and events/DW starters.

Events go for other events and shinies and DW starters.

In some cases

However, EV trained pokemon/IV bred pokemon aren't worth shinies/events/DW starters. In most cases, DW starters are hacked so asking them usually will result in nothing.

3 - **Rudeness!**. I do not like rude people and you have no place on this subreddit if all you want to do is nitpick and complain. It's not the type of community we are. 

4 - **A new rule

5 - **Absolutely no giveaways.** Don't post here if you looking for something but nothing to offer/giving away stuff. There's /r/pokemongiveaway for that reason. HOWEVER

Now, if someone attempts to take advantage of one of these people, the community stops the trade.

This is noble and completely understandable.  I respect you all for this.  But I don't think that a lot of people are making a good conversion from the capitalistic system of the real world to the loose barter system of /r/pokemontrades.  The fact of the matter is that we can't assign set values to Pokemon.  We can assign general values

When we enter into the legendary/event/shiny tier, Bob comes onto my thread and he *really* wants a shiny Drowzee.  Drowzee is his favorite Pokemon after all!  Bob offers me shiny Rattata, but I'm not interested.  Bob then offers his Arceus, but I'm not interested still.

Now, and he is completely willing to make this trade.  I haven't gone and held his arm behind his back to make him give up these shinies in an unfair trade.  Bob came to *me* with this offer, and he knows exactly what he's doing.  

It's not /r/pokemontrades' place to stonewall this trade because they don't value shiny Drowzee as much as Bob genuinely does.  This is because we are operating in a barter system.  There is no set value for each Pokemon.  It varies from person to person.  We can't go around pretending like we know the exact value of each and every Pokemon that's being offered because you don't.  Not everybody follows your line of thinking.  This is what makes the world a diverse and great place

So, and I really respect your selflessness, but don't attack OP because the person he's trading with doesn't value everything the same as you.

Thank you for reading

-- OldBreed4816

TL;DR: This is a barter system.  Please don't pretend like you know the value of a Pokemon.

I know there is a video guide on the sidebar

*****

Pokécheck is a website that is used to conduct legality analysis of Pokémons. In a GTS-like fashion

**Prerequisites:**

* A DS/DSi/3DS/3DS XL
* A Generation 4 (Diamond, HeartGold and SoulSilver) or Generation 5 (Black, White, Black 2 and White 2) game
* A working Wifi access

**Step 1: Creating an account on Pokécheck**

Pokémons deposited on Pokécheck must be claimed by their owner. If they are not claimed 24 hours after being deposited

**Step 2: Account options**

While we are at it

Option|Explanation
:---|:---
Show legality analysis by default|This will save you the effort of clicking on ""Show legality analysis"" while viewing a pokemon's page
Allow other users to see the legality analysis of my non public Pokémon|Self-explanatory
Use private as default privacy setting|The pokémons that you deposit will automatically be set as private

Optional: there are also customization options that you might want to edit:

Option|Explanation
:---|:---
Custom theme|Change the appearance of Pokécheck. Kaphotics suggests Modern
Columns to display in Pokémon lists|Changes the information displayed in boxes

Feel free to experiment. I've settled for the following columns: 

&gt;sprite,nick,nature,ability,itemicon,level,otflag,sid

**Step 3: Setting up your console**

Follow the guide on Pokécheck's main page on how to set up the custom DNS address on your console. If you encounter any issues

**Step 4: Your first upload**

Pick any pokémon of low value (Bidoof will do)

[Screenshot 1](http://i.imgur.com/Gct7rKj.png)

You should get an error/rejection message.

[Screenshot 2](http://i.imgur.com/zMQhD2h.png)

If you did not get rejected

**Step 5: Claiming the Pokémon**

Click on ""Unclaimed Pokémon from my IP"". You should see your Bidoof.

[Screenshot 3](http://i.imgur.com/hIVdnbN.png)

Tick the box to its left, and on your Bidoof's name to view its marvelous stats.


**Step 6: Creating a new box**

Create a new box on which you will move the pokémon you want to trade. Give it a descriptive name (""totally not hacked pokémons"" will be just fine) and move the pokes you want to trade in it.

**Step 7: Showcasing your collection**

If you followed the guide this far

Private|Public|Status|Effect
:--:|:--:|:---|:---
X|_|Private|The pokémon is private and no one but its owner can see/download it
_|X|Public|The pokémon is public
_|_|Read-only|The pokémon is read-only. Other viewers can view its page but not download it

The last configuration (unticking both Public and Private boxes) is the configuration you want to setup for the pokémons to show to other people.

**Step 8: Enabling public view**

The public view does not mean that your Pokémons are going to be public. It just allows you to link your box to someone else. Only the pokémons that are set as read-only or public will be visible on public view. Private pokémon will remain invisible. Public viewing is not available for your default box.

While in your trading box

[Screenshot 4](http://i.imgur.com/c9XcZa2.png)

A new option appears: ""Open public view"". Click on that link.

[Screenshot 5](http://i.imgur.com/b6w70YB.png)

The link to this page is the one you want to give out publicly. It has the following format:

&gt;https://www.pokecheck.org/?p=box&amp;bid=number&amp;u=nickname

The following link:

&gt;https://www.pokecheck.org/?p=user

is NOT a link to your trading box or to any of your boxes. If you ended up with this link

You're now ready to trade. Do not forget to review the rules of the subreddit before posting.

*****

**Addendum: the case of ribonned events**

Some pokémons come with a special ribbon that forbids them from being traded on the GTS. As a consequence

If you want to check one of them

* If you play on a emulator or a flashcard
* If you play on a retail game, or trade with a Wifi-enabled emulator. That done, extract the pkm files from the save.

Once you have the pkm files

* If you are unable to do the above

*****

**Addendum: the profanity filter**

Pokémons that have names/nicknames that may be offensive to children cannot be uploaded to the GTS, Cofagrigus, Froslass, Nosepass and Probopass cannot be traded out of the box on the GTS. You will need to nickname them before offering them for trade, or ask an event checker for a check.

*****

**Addendum: Pokémons deposited but not claimed**

You have 24 hours to claim a pokémon. If you deposited one but did not claim it during the 24-hour delay, or deleted. If you check this pokémon again, the legality analysis will mark it as a clone, because the pokémon is already in the database. If you are the original trainer of the pokémon, you can still claim it by registering your save file (see Pokécheck's main page for explanations). If you are not the OT, there is nothing you can do about it.",,,,

When trading, it's better off not to trade. Always double check the origins of pokemon.

1364270325.0,1b0t59,[Announcement] Tutorial on how to pokecheck events using a flashcart.,Leckcar,30,3,17,"This is a tutorial on how to pokecheck event pokemon (ribboned pokemon) if you have a flashcart. I know this might not apply to most of you but I hope I can help someone who wants to know.

**Requirements**

* Flashcart

* ROM of Pokemon Black or White

* Pokesav BW version or Pokegen

(I will not post a download link for pokesav because I dont want to get in any trouble


**Try this with a normal pokemon (i.e. Bidoof) first to prevent any mistakes from ruining your event pokemon.**

******

**Steps using Pokesav**

1. Make sure that you have got to the part where you can trade in your ROM

2. Trade the pokemon you want to check over to your game in your flashcart.

3. Save your flashcart game and turn it off.

4. Connect your flashcart to your computer.

5. Open your flashkart folder and search for the .sav file of your Pokemon BW ROM.

6. Copy it to your desktop. At this moment you can safely extract your flashkart and trade back your pokemon.

7. Open Pokesav and open your .sav file of your ROM using Pokesav

8. You will see all the data of your game

9. Go to the Party Section and you will see an outline of the pokemon in your party. Save the file of the pokemon you want to check.

* You can also go to 'Storage' and search through your boxes if your pokemon is in any of your boxes

10 . Finally upload them to pokecheck using the 'Choose File' section where you will pick the file of the pokemon and 'Import 5 Gen .pkmn file' option at the bottom of the page.

*******

**NOTE:** This is only the way to do it using Pokesav. I dont have any experience on using Pokegen so if someone knows how to please let me know and I will add it to the instructions.

------------------------

**One** - **No. Jumping. The gun.** I know everyone wants to be the one that points out someone is hacking but the moment you do that they delete the evidence. All of it. All we have is your word and while we trust it, don't call them out on it immediately. 

Take screenshots

**Two** - Pokecheck box. Now, nobody can steal your Pokemon and claim it as their own.

**Three** Check the users account. Account age

**Four** Check serebii, it does not mean it is legitimate, but a well trained eye could spot any sign of hacking if there.

**Five** SCREENSHOTS. Again with the screenshots, not after you've download them. This helps a lot with toning down suspicion. Also, include your username.

**Six** If someone has given you a hard time in a trade or anything of the sort, bad references are also encouraged, the worst thing is painting a picture of someone who they aren't.


**Seven** Avoid trading in PM's like the plague. We cannot help you spot a hack if nobody is there to see it. They are extremely suspicious trades


**Eight** ASK QUESTIONS AND ASK FOR PROOF - If something seems shady in a trade, but make them come up with some kind of a story. Usually its really easy to spot the shady ones. e.g. ""I got it from a friend at school he says its legit""


**Nine** Don't be afraid to get a second opinion before trading. We have a handy flair system now. Find a mod

**Ten** Collect all the info you can. Friend Codes

**Eleven** REPORT REPORT REPORT Use that little report button to silently draw our attention to shady threads and posts.

It's become a serious issue on this subreddit. Half of the threads posted here offering shiny or event pokemon offer up no pokechecks or back out as soon as they are requested. I wanted to bring this to light and also point out how to tell a fake from a genuine pokemon. 

[
This pokemon has been downloaded and re uploaded to pokecheck. As an event pokemon

And while I can't find a great example of this right now

Pokemon uploaded by default are set to private. If someone links you a pokemon that you can find in pokecheck search results

searching for a pokemon is easy. Just pick out the trainer ID in the image and search using pokecheck.org search utility. 

**Common Excuses:**

&gt; ""I can't pokecheck.""

If you can connect to trade

&gt; ""My pokemon can't be checked

I'd personally steer clear of any ""ribbon"" pokemon. The pokecheck website attaches a premiere ribbon to the pokemon so it can't be traded on the GTS or passed of as legit. There's a chance they've just downloaded that pokemon from pokecheck.
That said

[Take a look here to see if the pokemon you want should or shouldn't have a ribbon.](http://projectpokemon.org/events/en-V.php)

&gt; Just plain backing out or refusal to pokecheck

Just avoid. 

**When you pokecheck:**

* Make your account and ""claim"" the pokemon you've just uploaded. 
* at the very bottom there's a legality analysis button. Click that
* at the bottom of THAT window you can ""download the screen shot""
* copy paste that analysis in your trade.
* Be sure your pokemon is set to PRIVATE. Otherwise people can just search for your pokemon and download it without trading. Which I assume you don't want. 

**Other things you can do:**

Look at the users /r/pokemontrade comments
And if you get scammed with a hacked pokemon

------------------------------

Having grown up with pokemon since red and blue I hold a uniquely caught and bred pokemon in a higher esteem than a cloned one. I hope this PSA helps others figure out if they're getting a legitimate Pokemon in future trades.

FIRST (this has been beaten to death, or shinies. You should also be ready to post yours when asked. Got an event? There are plenty of people here who can check them for you. 

Secondly

Thirdly, you have more eyes. Many of us will call out a fake or clone if we see it. If SteveThePokedestroyer has a cloned poke we'll say so. If it's all pm's we can't help as a community. If someone is trading the same poke to different people we're much more likely to notice if there are similar threads popping up. Hell, I had no idea that wondercards could be easily hacked until someone pointed one out. 

Finally if you do get scammed please be tactful. Message the person message the mods first. There have been cases of people unknowingly having hacked or cloned pokes. So just be careful before sharpening your pitchfork.

Some people - not a large number

Now, so your Dex-filling will be fine. No one wants to hack as run-of-the-mill Poke. But this means that any events you need and/or want are potentially cloned, hacked or both. 

Some things to keep in mind when looking at legality analyses:

* Look at the location where the Pokemon was met

* Look at the level when it was caught

* Look up the Original Trainer and their Trainer ID and Secret ID. If a person hacks one Pokemon

* Look at the moves the Pokemon knows

* Cross-reference any event you trade for on something like Bulbapedia, the moves and level are correct, and so on. 

And possibly the most important advice I can give: 

*Look up the history of whomever you may be trading with.* Someone could have had problems trading with that person and never reported them, but it takes two people for someone to get scammed.

So my older brother's birthday was a bit ago and I haven't had a chance to see him until now. He originally introduced me to Pokemon back in the R/B/Y era and I have been hooked since. I had originally planned to use the Masuda Method to breed him one of these Pokemon as a gift for his birthday and a thank you as well. However I have been breeding for weeks and nothing. I have been too busy to really focus and breed a shit-ton of them to get one. So I come humbly to you [/r/pokemontrades](/r/pokemontrades) in the hopes that one of you would be so kind as to trade me one for the measly scraps that I offer. 

I don't have much in the way of legendary's or any shinies. I do however have:

- An entire National Dex of breed-able Pokemon of which you can have any number of them.

- The Bird Trio, Articuno.

As many of you have seen, when you apply for the Pokeballs you must link your own trades as we cannot go through and count every single trade you have ever done.  You should link your /r/poketradereferences page, there is an example below. **Please make sure you post your trades inside your reference thread!**  With that said, here are how many trades you need to get a Pokeball, as well as the different tiers of Pokeballs:

Tier 1 Pokeballs (Every Pokemon trade counts)

* Pokeball: 5 successful trades

* Premier Ball: 10 successful trades

Tier 2 Pokeballs (You must deal with shinies/events/valuables)

* Great Ball: 20 successful trades

* Ultra Ball: 30 successful trades

Tier 3 Pokeballs

* GS Ball: 50+ successful trades
The GS Ball is special, you need a good history and proper behavior as well as 50+ successful trades under your belt.

I would like to remind everyone that **YOU** must link your references pages as well as the trade numbers that you have done and the links. If you do 5 trades in 1 thread

Any questions? Unclear points? Feel free to ask!

Common Q&amp;A:

--------------------------------------------------------------------

* Q: I have a lot of people I have traded with and asked for a reference but they have either not left one

* A: Try to get a link and add to your reference page. The person does not have to post to your reference page.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

* Q: I'm hearing a lot about multiple trades in one session. So I traded 30-40 Pokemon with &lt;insertusername&gt;. How do I document this properly for credit? Do I need to name all 40 Pokemon that were traded?

* A: A link to the thread with the number of trades is what is required. You don't need to include an entire list of all the pokemon traded. (Unless Shiny/Event/Legendary i believe?)

--------------------------------------------------------------------

* Q: Is it possible to have multiple Pokeballs in Flair indicating the highest level achieved per tier? Or will it just be 1 ball for the highest level?

* A: No

--------------------------------------------------------------------

* Q: Do trades through /r/pokemongiveaways count as well? Can't give something for nothing after all

* A: No

--------------------------------------------------------------------

* Q: Do tradebacks count?

* A: No

--------------------------------------------------------------------

* Q: Do trades made before this post count?

* A: Yes

--------------------------------------------------------------------

* Q: When will I know when I have my Flair?

We wanted to be transparent about this and bring it to the community's attention.  We are not completely sure what to do while we figure out how to handle all of these issues and we would appreciate any feedback you can give us.  Please post in this thread with ideas on how to cutback on the scamming that has been going on in our fine sub.

----

In the mean time

* RESEARCH YOUR TRADE- please please PLEASE research what you are trading for and who you are trading with

* Do some slight research on who you are trading with

* For event Pokemon you should cross reference [Serebii's Event Database](http://www.serebii.net/events/)

* Check shiny and legendary Pokemon you trade for, etc

* If you see suspicious activity

I've noticed a bit of an increase in troll accounts and all-around assholes just trying to get a rise out of people because that's how they get their kicks in life. Do not respond to these people and don't comment on their threads. That's what they want. Trolls do crave attention

This is a great subreddit and has been mostly self-governing ever since us new mods stepped in (including me with my warpath about FCs and Pokechecks). One of the good things about this community is that it's not too big like /r/pokemon

1306009917.0,hgvf3,The r/pokemontrades (Belated) one thousand subscribers egg extravaganza! ,Hypobasis,24,2,265,"All right

For those who are new

You could get Bidoofs

A couple of things rules to note:

* Feel free to trade (Saturday)
* Please don't try to pull a fast one and hand out eggs with legendaries in them. We're not morons. You will get a warning (which is quite visible).
* Try and trade something cool
* Giveaways are welcome of course

A couple of things to note when you receive an egg:

* If it's something incredible common and quite boring, as it could have DW moves or egg moves.
* Don't tell anyone what you received. Keep it a surprise until the day after
* Note the side bar, Flame Body and Magma Armor abilities halve hatch times.

**How To**

There's two ways to join in.

a) You can ""broadcast"". Basically

    Time(s) Available: 
     XX:XX PM/AM - XX:XX PM/AM {TIMEZONE} {DATE} (XX hours from this post) 

    Number of Eggs available: XX 

    Current Amount of Eggs: XX

Simply copy and paste the above template into your post replacing all the X's and {TIMEZONE} with just your info. **MAKE SURE YOU FILL OUT THE ""HOURS FROM THIS POST""** section. It makes it amazingly easy to figure out what time your available if the person is in a different time zone than you.

Multiple ""available"" times are perfectly acceptable

As you make trades, feel free to make a bunch of options for a person to accept (say, pick a number between 1 and 3, then give them the corresponding egg)

When your time comes up, enter their friend code, make the trade, and reply to their post so you know it's complete. If you got multiple people waiting, tell them to hold on while you get the person ahead of you.

b) You can trade without a ""broadcast""

To do this, that way you can make the trade as fast as possible. Trade one of your eggs for one of theirs.

**Important:**

It's a statutory holiday for us master race Canadians on Monday. So feel free to trade on those days too.

1376747432.0,1kjrx5,[Mod Post] Please make sure you're reading the rules!,cryophantom,21,1,4,"Hey all

As our time in 5th gen nears a close and hype for gen 6 is at its peak, in spite of changes to the sub design made primarily to put important information in a more visible and accessible layout.

If you haven't done so yet, mostly to keep actual trading threads from disappearing among a sea of off-topic questions, ditto requests, beggars, and value/legality posts.

Also recently, are responding and going along with threads that are against the rules.  All this does is teach these users that breaking the rules is fine, and they don't need to be bothered reading them.  I know most of you are just trying to help, but if you want to do that, just take it to PMs.  Please, if you see a post that is breaking one of the sub rules, the correct course of action would be to report it and make a simple post reminding them they're breaking the rules, that would just cause more chaos than good.

Anyways, here's what the main offenders have been lately:

1.  **DON'T ASK FOR DITTOS READ THE SIDEBAR**
2.  Don't ask questions that aren't directly related to the trading of pokemon.  There are bunches of other pokemon related subs that can help.  Have a question about RNG or competitive battling?  There are subs for that
3.  Don't ask questions that are already clearly answered in the guides posted in the sidebar.  **READ THEM FIRST**.
4.  **DON'T ASK FOR DITTOS READ THE SIDEBAR**
5.  Don't ask what something is worth.  Again
6.  Don't ask if every single one of your pokemon is legit.  If you don't know where it came from, try to find a trusted user or a mod to help you out.  If you have questions about something that looks suspicious though, **DON'T TRADE IT**.  Common sense.  
7.  **DON'T ASK FOR DITTOS READ THE SIDEBAR**
8.  Don't ask for handouts

And not necessarily a solid rule

* Be specific.  Don't post threads like ""LF: Offers FT: Ask""  Come prepared with pokechecks, check out everyone else's threads first.

On the whole

1375652823.0,1jp9rf,[Feedback] Changes to the sub and flair system.,cryophantom,20,1,109,"So as I'm pretty sure you've all noticed

We are using a brand new CSS template for the entire sub

With that said, we welcome any input you may have on the design, or suggestions you might have to improve it.

Now, the Master Ball didn't make as much sense to be used for event checkers, and was more naturally the choice to give to the most trusted traders.  For this reason, we decided to switch the event check flair over to the Cherish Ball (since, you know, all events come in them nowadays).  We understand this might cause some confusion initially, but with the new chart in the sidebar

The Pokeball flair has also been changed to be achievable at 5 successful trades, making it a more impressive jump to match the importance of changing from basic trades to shinies and events.

However, so if you as a community want the flair switched back to how it was, or have other suggestions of what they should be, please let us know here.

Download [this](http://ubuntuone.com/4PJs98KD227M0fJO6sYzi5) first and extract the files.

~~-----~~

Instructions:

1. Install WinPCap using the exe. (If it says 'This program has compatability issues' then just press 'run the program...')

2. Open the correct version of DeSmuME (32- or 64-bit, mine happens to be *Intel(R) 82579LM Gigabit Network Connection* (Just as an example).

3. Open *config &gt; emulation settings* and check *Use external BIOS images*, and for the ARM7 image, select your *biosnds7.bin*.

4. In the same window check *Use external firmware image* and use the *firmware.bin* from the download folder. Then check *Boot form firmware (like the NDS)*.

5. Find a suitable rom, select *Search for an access point* which should give *SoftAP* as the only option. Select this and then continue.

6. Play through the game a bit so WiFi functionality is available (e.g. Defeat Cheren in B2W2)

7. Use pokegen to open the save file (will be a .dsv file in the *Battery* folder) and extract the .pkm(s) of your Pokémon and then use them as normal with Pokécheck.

1375910020.0,1jwspa,[Mod Post] Finalized Flair Information,cryophantom,16,2,54,"--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Based on your recent community input and mod decision, with an awesome original ""official"" sprite courtesy of /u/nextlevelcolors.

Now, link the thread and what you traded into your reference page ([Here is an example of a good format.](http://www.reddit.com/r/poketradereferences/comments/1j2nt8/pkmn_trades_examples_reference/))

Once that is done

So now

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Tier 1 Balls** (Any Trades Count)

* Pokeball - - 5+ Trades
* Premier Ball - - 10+ Trades

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Tier 2 Balls** (Only trades involving shinies/events count toward your total beyond 10 trades)

* Great Ball - - 20+ Trades
* Ultra Ball - - 30+ Trades
* Master Ball - - 50+ Trades

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Special Balls**

* G/S Ball - - These users are 100% Trusted by the Mods.  Not only have they completed many trades, and the distribution is completely up to the mods' decision.  If you have not already been approved for a masterball, the chances of being approved for a G/S ball are slim to none.
* Cherish Ball - - These users are also 100% trusted by the mods
* Other Balls/Flairs - - Any other ball or other flair image you see is mod-only.  Simply something used to set us apart from the sea of other balls.  Call it a job perk.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Now

First, not 3.

Tier 1 trades only count up to 10, count towards higher balls also.  This means a minimum of 10 high-valued trades (along with 10 standard) are required to reach Great Ball status, and so on.

**Giveaways

It is not possible to have multiple flairs.

If you've already submitted an app

Also

Similarly

**!!!!!** **Important Note** - If you are *reapplying* for a higher flair

I apologize for any confusion that there's been while we've been trying to get the system implemented.  Now that the levels are set

For the most part, if you can post and link to a trade thread where you have a trade that is pending on a check, I will give you priority.

Everyone needs to be fast and efficient so that we can get as much done as possible.  If we enter the room and there seems to be any kind of connection issues, stay in the room and wait for me to come back.  It will only take about 2 minutes once I leave to check them and come back.

Once you recieve a PM from me saying you're up, you will be skipped over.  Again, its all about being as fast and ready as possible.

Another tip is to have the pokemon you need checked in your party so you don't have to sit and look through your boxes in the trade room.

Also, but if you want a bunch done, like 10+, we're going to need to plan a time, and I'll probably ask for something in return for the time commitment.

- One per person. I will be doing this for the benefit of all of you
- I have work every night from 5:30-11 EST (potentially later

~~Hello ladies and gentlemen of /r/pokemontrades!! It is my great pleasure to bring to you 30 Wishmaker Jirachi this holiday season. I've had kind of a crappy year but still want to try and end it on a high note as best I can. One of the ways I thought I could achieve this was by showing my appreciation to one of my most frequented subreddits!! You guys have helped me complete pokedexes, downloading a Jirachi from my Wishmaker Bonus Disc, trading it over to my copy of Leaf Green and then doing the whole process all over again until I had an entire box full for you guys. With that said, we can now proceed to the details.~~

~~Currently all the Jirachi are on my copy of Diamond (4th Gen). None of them have been transferred up to my copy of White (5th Gen)

~~If you would like one, in order to give as many people as possible a chance at owning this awesome little guy I will unfortunately have to impose the rule of **one per person**.~~

~~Anyhoo, try my best to post an up to date list of who is getting one and which one they are getting so check back if you haven't received a reply. As for the trades themselves, I would like to keep them interesting, because let's face it nobody likes a box full of Bidoof :P, but anything will be acceptable and none shall be refused as this is indeed a giveaway!!!~~

This looks to be ready to roll. Please excuse the first month if things don't go quite so smoothly while things get settled and worked out. I've left the other edits in place for reference (so some of the comments make sense)

Here are the rules for the Egg Swap:

1. Subreddit rules still apply (hacked, it's still not allowed)



2. You must have filled out **[this registration form](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/viewform?pli=1&amp;formkey=dDZhWUdHcm5ob1BsLS1jc1VKSEJKcmc6MQ)** before 23:00 Pacific 14th of the month. These are timestamped automatically. 

3. Partnerships (and FC's) will be sent as close to 00:01 Pacific on the 15th of every month

4. It is 100% your responsibility to make contact with your assigned partner and arrange a trade. You'll be given their reddit username and FC

5. If you want to trade more than 1 egg with a person

6. After you're assigned, the trade must have been completed by May 10th.

7. After you Swap

8. If you'd like to trade with more than 1 person for month

9. If, please fill out the feedback form before any trade occurs, noting ‘REFUSED’ in the required pokemon fields. They will be contacted ASAP with a new partner. You will not be able to be re-matched for that month, and this refusal will be publicly available.  No refusal will be accepted after the 1st of the new month.

10. If

11. 2 warnings will be investigated; there is a possibility of banning from the program. 3 or more warnings will always result in a ban from the program. I don't have a ban list set up and I don't want to start one

If you have any questions, I'd just like to head off any problems as early as possible.

**EDIT 1:**

After thinking on this a lot, feedback, etc. what follows is a list of what I'd **like** to do with this.

1. To participate in the coming month's Swap

2. On the 15th

3. It is then on both of you to make contact, etc.)

4. After you've made the first Swap of the month

5. If something goes wrong, of course) I'd just stop including them.

* Zorua's are not rare. I see many post offering zoruas for legends and stuff.

* Pokecheck stuff please

* Everyone should get their FC beside their name.

* There is a link in the sidebar to an explanation on how to trade

* Put LF/FT in the title please

* If someone is doing a giveaway

* Stop saying ""FT: Ask

* Posts asking about wifi advice or pokecheck assurance etc isn't what this subreddit is about.

I'm mainly looking for a shiny Pidove

I really want that shiny Pidove, it is Adamant with Flash Fire, with the OT Kate I think, that or Roxy. I've checked Pokecheck to see if anyone still has them on pokecheck, but it looks like they aren't up. 

I don't care if you have evolved them

[Hayley's Mew](https://www.pokecheck.org/?pk=4202696) I'll work on the Meloetta check once I have gotten the people who have them. Current natures for Deoxys I have are;

* Timid x2

* Jolly

* Hasty x2

* Bashful 

* Naive x2

* Docile 

* Bold

* Brave

* Careful

* Rash

I can reset for another nature if none of these suit you.

I'll trade 2:1 for each shiny pokemon.

I know we have all seen these postings. They crop up at least once every few weeks, I really wanted to toss a post up for some of the newer members to the community.

 * Trading Hacked Pokemon is Forbidden

 * Trading Cloned Pokemon is Forbidden

 * Screenshots do not *always* suffice (e.g. certain events).

 * Not sure if the Pokecheck means the Pokemon is hacked? Ask a valued community member. (If you haven't been here long enough to know who they are, to help each other.)

 * Need an Event checked? Look around - Every day there are posts made about people Event checking pokemon because they know how important it is we keep this sub clear of hacked/cloned pokemon.

 * Not sure about someone? Check the Reddit Username's age. If the account is a day old

I know how important dex is to some people. I know how important shiny is to some people

I appeal to the individuals

If you read this far I appreciate the time you spent doing so; I hope this posting helped. If you need information on services provided here

There are many other resources these are just a few!

**TL;DR: Trading a Shiny/Event/Legendary/Not-So-Sure-Special Pokemon? Get a Pokecheck first because without it the trade is illegitimate. Be smart for yourself, contact a Moderator. Take down FC's, Reddit Usernames, Any Identifiable Characteristics.**

/u/Minister_of_truth suggested test pokécheck first by using a random pokemon like a Patrat

**If you have an unregistered account/game only the ''unclaimed from my IP'' is important. If it's registered

* Go to unclaimed from my IP on pokecheck. Under the box of the pokemon it will say ''associate this pokemon with my account. Click that. **Do not make the pokemon public or private. Public means it's a download

* Go to account options and you'll see an option ''allow other users to see legality analysis of my non public pokemon'' and save that.

Your pokemon will be then set on a [neutral status](http://i.imgur.com/cFatr.png?1) and the legality analysis will be able to be seen. (Imgur photo by /u/DanTheRip) 

And there you go

Edit - How to link a box.

* Create a new box. Pokecheck has a default box that is unable to be linked. So let's say I wanted a box with my Smeargle for trade. 

* Go to manage my pokemon and there will be ''box management'' with Existing boxes and create a new box. Name it 'smeargle'' and click create. Then set ''Smeargle'' as your active box 

* Once you made your box

* Once all your pokemon are in the desired box

How to link a screenshot without imgur 

* Pick any pokemon you want the screenshot of. At the end of the analysis

I'm a bit OCD about my Pokemon.  I catch all of my Pokemon in Poke Balls and all of my legendaries in Premier Balls.  I only have a copy of Black 2, I will need Pokechecks for the Pokemon.  I've been cheated out of shinies in past, so I'm going to be a bit more cautious this time, so I apologize for the inconvenience.

I don't expect any one person to get *all* of these Pokemon for me, ability, shininess, gender, etc.) of your choosing for every **six** of these Pokemon you can give me.  I hope that's enough considering the particularity of my request, haha!  Of course, if someone gives me **twelve** Pokemon, if you give me **ten** Pokemon

I don't expect this to happen overnight either, but if I'm unable to reach you for an extended period of time after I've finished your Pokemon, I'll move on to the next offer, so KIT.

*If you've already caught your legendaries

Now, I catch all of my legendaries in **Premier Balls** and I hope to keep my collection that way.  So, I make you this offer: I'll give you **one** RNG'd shiny of your choice for **each untrained legendary caught in a Premier Ball.**  The legendaries I need are:

- ~~Reshiram~~
- ~~Regice~~
- ~~Latias~~

I will need Pokechecks for these guys as well.

I think that I've been more than fair in my overtly OCD request, wait to see if I can get some more offers and get some shinies to other people, but if I can't find anyone else to fill the order, I'll most definitely hit you up.  Thank you all!

You have one full calendar week to claim your prize unless you let me know that you can't collect it in that time-span. If you do not it goes to the next person who wanted it.

Also be on the lookout for my Super Pokemon Giveaway coming sometime in the next few weeks in celebration of me completing my very first National Pokedex.

**Morning Edit:** Everyone seems to love Sudowoodo so I shall breed him for anybody who wanted one.

So, which was the whole reason I even started trading shinies.  So, basically, I don't really need these guys anymore.  But, I felt it would be better to reintroduce the shinies back into the /r/pokemontrades economy rather than have it end up in some 12-year-old's PC box over at /r/pokemongiveaway.  Seriously though, guys, use /r/pokemongiveaway.  It's a good way to be generous, if more of you browsed over there, but there will be at least a little bartering done here

**Rules:**

- Shinies are only open to people who don't have shinies yet
- I will not trade with new accounts as to actually give shinies to people who don't have them.  Sorry if you're new
- One shiny per person
- Legendaries are open to everybody
- Two legendaries per person
- We need to trade for something that I don't already have as to consider this a trade and not a giveaway
- If you don't follow the rules

**Shinies:**

- ~~Aggron~~
- ~~Crobat~~
- ~~Dustox~~
- ~~Liepard~~

**Legendaries:**

- ~~Groudon~~
- ~~Lugia~~
- ~~Moltres~~
- ~~Rayquaza~~
- ~~Reshiram~~
- ~~Uxie~~
- ~~Virizion~~
- ~~Zapdos~~
- ~~Zekrom~~

First off

&gt; I've recently been playing pokemon black on my pc using an emulator

&gt; Thanks in advance for the answer

Basically, via an emulator.

**lolcoster** replied with:
&gt; As long as these are pokemon that you're catching legitimately (no AR or pokesav) then it should be fine. If you want to trade

&gt;Just don't cheat and you should be fine.

Just a reminder

As usual, or ""Too good to be true"" trades are dead giveaways.

If you happen to be using an emulator for a trade

Next

&gt; A few days back I posted about finding a Mew for my copy of HeartGold. I missed the event

&gt;Someone responded with 151GTS

&gt;I have no problem using the mew I downloaded in my own game. It reminds me of my Mew from Yellow

&gt;Thoughts?

and my Reply: 

&gt; Those websites produce ""Legal"" Pokemon , moves are fine).

&gt; I'm not a fan of these sites. To me

&gt; However, you just can't have possibly gotten that Mew ever, which is disappointing. When it comes to legendaries, knock yourself out. Just keep in mind a few things so people don't get pissy at you:

&gt; *    Make sure they're legit (check up the Serebii site for the stats on the event Mew and make sure they're the same)
&gt; *    Make sure explain to the person your battling against that your Mew
&gt; *    Never, the effect of ""I'm trading a mew, make me an offer"" diminishes.

&gt; That being said

I'm willing to hunt pokemon for people from those games.  I noticed people asking for 2nd, so i'm here to help my fellow trainers out.

**NOTABLES OF EACH GAME** 

* Only a Latios in ruby to aquire
* Heatran only legend to aquire in Pt
* Only at 8 badges in SS so Lugia and 1 roaming dog to aquire for someone

So ask away and happy hunting trainers.  :)

* People offering a shiny are main priority

For those that were able to make it to see me I hope you guys enjoyed this day as much as I have. Every pokemon traded out today had this thing called Pokerus. For those of you who don't know it is a virus that can spread from each member of your team through battling. It will leave a pokemon on the third midnight it is left out of a box. To keep simply stick it in a pc box and it will be safe. If it does happen to leave a pokemon do not fear. The effects of it stay forever. How ever it can no longer be passed on to other pokemon. 

For those who were unable to get your pokemon today I am sorry but I have closed this giveaway. I however will be making another giveaway within the next few weeks I will post a date and the new pokemon. I will give you guys the first opportunity at the new/old (if you would still like them). I will keep this list as what I did not accomplish to make sure.

Next Giveaway: I will make a post saying the next day

Once again, I am leaving tomorrow/today for his place. Have fun for now guys and see you soon

As for the process, I might skip ahead and prioritize them.  During the check, please stay in the room, as it will only take a minute for me to hop off and dump the .pkm files.  Also, when we start trading, you have two choices as far as pokecheck goes.  Either pm me your username and a temporary password and I'll upload them to your account, or pm me a name to use for a new account which I will create and then give you the password to.

Leave a comment here and I will message you when I’m ready. If I don’t hear back within 5 minutes of responding to you

PM me back your FC and Pokecheck login info with a temp password.

Move all the pokemon you want traded into 1 place so you know where they are before asking for Checks.

I don't care if you trade me back the same pokemon I gave you (unless I tell you). They are just extras for trading.

Stay in the room until we are done.
