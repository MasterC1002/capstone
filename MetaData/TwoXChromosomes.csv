1374241279.0,1imp4j,Ending my pregnancy at five months; the last thing I ever thought I would do,getthisoffmymind,4759,2120,644,"Long post warning.

I'm posting this to help myself by getting it out

Every test went swimmingly. With a few pretty-common bumps in the road

Since things were so good

To my untrained eye, and I could tell without the tech telling me that it was a boy.

The tech, very long time on the baby's heart. She tried to find other techs to look, but it was the last appointment of the day and they had all gone home. She moved on, measured other things, and confirmed that he was a boy. She then told us that we needed to have a fetal echocardiogram. She said, ""I'm just a tech, I can't confirm anything right now

I called my doctor the next morning

The days leading up to the next appointment were the longest of my life... up until that point

We went into the level two and met with a tech first. She was cheerful and I asked if she would give us pictures. She said yes. As she conducted the test

The doctor came in and introduced himself, as well as other internal structural issues. He then told us no one in the region was equipped to deal with the syndrome he thought our baby had, and we needed to go to a special hospital. To avoid identifying myself, I'm leaving out the syndrome and the hospital. 

The hospital scheduled to see us the very next morning for another echo. They called me and told me that I needed to know one of the things they would talk to me about was ending my pregnancy

Of course I wouldn't

They saw us first thing the next morning. We saw a pediatric cardiologist that I later learned was the best in the country for what we were facing. He was very kind, I'd be easy to find. He explained there was a spectrum for children with this syndrome. Some were able to live into their late teens and even go to school. Others died within the first couple weeks of life. Our baby, he said, was on the worst end of the spectrum. He told us all the things he would do if we decided to proceed: all the surgeries, the inevitable transplants, the requirements for our home if he was able to come home. If we moved forward, they would do whatever they could to keep him alive.

The doctor then left

I've never been so out of my mind. Angry, life-hating... every negative emotion was all there, all at once. I wanted nothing more in my life than to have this baby.

They told us we had a week to make a decision (for legal reasons in my state) .

At first, their advice in the public forum was to proceed. Yet none of them knew the extent of their child's issues before the child was born. I was ""lucky"" in that way. I looked at their albums of their babies: little babies that lived in hospitals or on machines at home. The ones at the end of the spectrum with us; they weren't making it past nine months. Nine months on machines with tubes going in and out, everywhere. Massive open heart and open stomach surgeries. 

One woman messaged me privately to give me the advice none of the rest had. 

Then another woman. And another.

Then finally one that had made the decision to end the pregnancy.

My husband and I saw our doctor, and that we should very seriously consider the fact that we had the power to prevent him from suffering.

Everyone around me had already made their decision for what they thought I should do

I was completely willing to give up my job

Some people say

And so as you can tell from the title

At five months, a D&amp;C, or delivery? This was an easy one for me, but I learned later it's not easy for a lot of people. Delivery was the only option in my mind. I felt badly later when I talked to a friend who had to end a pregnancy at five months for medical reasons. I assumed she delivered, but she didn't. She chose a different road. We delivered our baby. We named him. We held him, and we buried him near my grandmother. My friend had a D&amp;C, her husband didn't even want to know the sex, but I can say she was envious that we were ""strong enough"" as she put it

His headstone was recently put in

I want you all to know that you have choices. 

You may have support, each one of them confessed they wanted us to make the choice we made and not to allow him to live a short and painful life.

I am terrified that people will judge me harshly for this. Even strangers. No one would say it to my face,000 characters telling strangers, and I know what doors that opens. It's ok to disagree with my decision, but like the nurse told me, you never know what you will do when it's actually your turn to decide. Keep an open mind, do what's best in your situation. Know that I am here, supporting whatever decision you make.

On the day of the burial, it's been nine months and I still feel that way many days. I'm still angry, mad, confused. But every day I find some peace knowing I loved him even though I held him once, and that if I ever happen to meet him in the great beyond, that he'll forgive me.",,,,

So last Saturday, 2 years ago. I trusted the Army and went to the on-post pharmacy for Plan B (for free).

It was the most awful

Two months after that

Fast forward to last weekend. I'm debating which pharmacy to choose, small minds... but it's empty, and I go for it. In uniform. (On my way home from work)

Me: ""Sir

Him: ""Yes

Him: ""Are you over 18? hardy-har-har""

Me: ""Yes

Him: ""Well

Me: ""No

Him: ""Well

Me: ""I'm certainly old enough to know better.""

Him: ""What age is that? Because I mess up all the time!""

I was dumbstruck. He was in his late 50's. Amazingly kind

Edit: Thank you all for your kind wishes. I wish I had reported that pharmacist at the time, because I am in Aviation, and a flight doc can revoke my flight status over damn near anything.

I am able to apply my basic makeup (foundation, eyeliner, and mascara) in less than five minutes now. I really enjoy makeup, so it's not any inconvenience or problem to do it daily. That being said, I have never in my life gone out my front door without makeup because I was so horrified with my natural state and assumed others would be too.

But last night I made the bold decision to go out with my natural hair *and* sans makeup. It was such a huge accomplishment in loving myself, insecure girl I was just years ago. I am a grown woman who loves herself (and who still loves makeup), and I couldn't be more thrilled!

I know not everyone is the same, but what's the big deal? I see posts all the time about guys being inappropriate and girls getting super offended. What is wrong with telling them ""hey, man, don't be a dick"" instead of getting pissed and running away like you're a victim? I just feel like lots of girls overreact about 'sexual harassment' on here. I understand that a stranger hitting on you is creepy and unsettling, I understand that a friend grabbing your butt is uncomfortable, but why not *say something* and get on with your life?

I'll probably get downvoted to hell

Thanks

**Edit:** Holy crap. I was *not* expecting this to get as much attention as it is getting. Let me hit on a few points mentioned instead of replying to every single comment.

1. I have been harassed too many times to count. I've been raped
2. Most men who are rude and harass women do it just because they're women and they *want* to humiliate them. 
3. This is a public forum
4. Ignoring crude comments from people is probably just as effective

I went back to college at 40, but attributed all that that to just having the follow-through-it-ness of an empty-nest mom on a mission.

Genetics always fascinated me. I did my internship at a genetics testing place with some intimidatingly smart, right? My creativeness was actually really helpful for the pattern recognition needed to sort out chromosomes- a skill I possessed that they said they had never seen the likes of. 

Fast-forward five years. Out of nowhere, they wanted ME to fill the position doing tissue culture and karyotyping. I could just pee. It's everything I worked for. They are eager to teach me as much about genetics as I am willing to learn. I will learn ALL THE THINGS! Best week ever. I am closing in on 50 and I have a new career and I actually feel like I am a real scientist! Moral of this story, you are NEVER too old.

That's right. Planned Parenthood.

Why?

Well, treating an STI or anything else like that. (All those ""dirty whore"" things that people love to hate on.) Actually, I am sick and I can't get well. Down there. Not that it really matters why. (TMI?)

You know they do that at Planned Parenthood

And sometimes ""down there help"" does include terminating a pregnancy, diagnosing ovarian cysts, treating irregular periods, investigating pain that won't go away. Down there gets complicated.

I don't have medical insurance. Not because I am reckless

I am a freelancer with no ""employer provided plan."" I am member of 3 unions who can barely afford to cover their members, I'm too rich to qualify. Too freakin' rich. (Come over and hang out on my yacht sometime.)

I am white, married, and employed. Double income, no kids. (I have all the safety nets, right?) I pay my bills and taxes. I have held up every end of the bargain that is the American dream and I am nobody's charity case. I am paying for my visit. Because I can and because, if I can, I should. And because my money will help the next woman who can't.

I am sick and I can't get well. Sick enough that I can't wait for another program to approve me for a doctors visit. I can't wait until I can afford insured healthcare. I can't even wait for the ""promised land"" of ""Obamacare."" 

I'm sick right now.

And I'm lucky to be sitting here in a safe facility, and positive.

I am also surrounded by a multitude of diverse women, black, Latina, Asian, Arab and yes, white-as-bleached-towels like me. Some of them are chatty, some of them are pensive, whatever the reason they are here

And (thank the good lord above) that Planned Parenthood is here to provide help to them. And help to me. Your friend

When I arrived today

And then

I actually forgot for a moment that there are people who hate Planned Parenthood. Who want to stop Planned Parenthood. And that there are people who would not simply use legislation or bullying to accomplish that. 

Once I enter this building I am not safe. Because there are people who WANT TO KILL the doctors for providing care ""down there."" There are people who WANT TO KILL me for coming here. That think I'm a ""whore."""" A not just a woman who needs to see a doctor for a reason that is nobody's business. 

I stand with Planned Parenthood. I stand for a women's choice
and access to medical care. 

I stand with Julia who treated me

I stand with all the other women I encountered in the clinic: alone, reading magazines, getting tests.

Today in Union Square the World Life Organization had a HUGE stage up, the MAN on the microphone.

I started shaking

He was obviously hesitant

""Have you ever had an abortion?"" I asked him.

""No.""

""We'll I have, I'm healthy, I'm beautiful. I work a great job and am in a fantastic relationship. I can't wait till the moment in the future when I AM ready to have a child. So I don't think you have any right whatsoever to speak about morality when you've NEVER had to make that decision.""

I walked away while he ridiculed me in front of the crowd. A few people tried to block my way

I guess I'm just looking for support. I just admitted to over 200 people that i had an abortion. It's been an hour and my adrenaline is pumping

Was I out of line?

Edit: wow, whoever you are.

Also, or making conservative political statements. Also, the fact that he was a man DOESN'T MEAN HE'S NOT ENTITLED to his opinion. But holding an opinion and preaching to a crowd about what I am supposed to do with a uterus he has never had is a bit different.

We were discussing various businesses concerning marketing and just general boring stuff when my Professor brings up Tampax. Not a big deal

That's when my Professor steps in. He calls on the young man in the back

""You think this is GROSS?! and you don't see how it's RELEVANT to anything?! How about Tampax is a multimillion dollar company that provides a product that HALF of the human population NEEDS to live comfortably?! You don't want to make millions of dollars because you think this is GROSS?! You don't want to provide a product that makes life easier for women because you think it's gross!?""

He went on to say that the kid wouldn't make it anywhere if he didn't realize that women were a huge target market and that if he was that grossed out by women he should hope to work for an all male company. Which of course

It may not have been a huge gesture and I think it was more of a business savvy issue

Let me tell you something a lot of people aren't going to like to hear. I don't regret it. I never think about it. I don't sit and cry wondering what my kid would have been like. I was 21

Please don't let people make you believe that an abortion will haunt you for the rest of your life. Please dont' let them force you by fear into something you don't want. 

**I don't regret it. And I'm not ashamed that I had an abortion**

**EDIT:** For clarification. I don't believe that all women will feel as I do. And there are some women that will regret their choice. Some may regret it but still feel it was the right choice. Some will feel it was the wrong one. No one should dictate your feelings to you or make you ashamed of them no matter what they are. 

By ""myth"" I meant the story that gets told to these women that ALL women regret it and spend their lives in an emotional black hole because of it. Will some: yes

Alrighty, because I am a friggin' wizard with a flat iron. I'm a genuine, bona fide, certified, gold-star ugly gal. Lost the genetic lottery. Fell out of the ugly tree. Hit in the face with the ugly stick. I'm stressing this because I know how incredibly supportive this subreddit can be (""You're all beautiful! Everyone's beautiful! You're beautiful!""), but *ugly people do exist* and there are a lot of us, despite how drop-dead gorgeous we might be on the inside.

I guess I'm just wanting to vent a little, cat calls, handling friends who have fallen in love with you, being dumped my male friends when it's obvious you're not going to have sex with them, being dismissed as just a cute girl, etc, etc. I just want to say that this is *all completely alien to me*. Holy shit, impostor girl because I seriously cannot relate at all.

So, advice, etc. Honestly, it's ridiculously hard to commiserate about this ever, because admitting to being ugly is such a gigantic taboo for a girl. Let's make this one of the rare opportunities to let some steam off.

To get us started

**1)** Not being able to talk about it, I'm sure you're beautiful."" Being ugly is tough, especially for girls - looks are incredibly important. I need a place to vent.

**2)** Needing to try incredibly hard to be recognised academically or vocationally. I've been snubbed for awards that are *based on score*

**3)** Forming friendships. This can be hard

**4)** Not being able to relate to other girls. For the luckier

**5)** Wearing pretty outfits. Although I try to look presentable, because it's like putting lipstick on a pig. I know that's a pretty fucked mentality, but I'm in confession mode.

**6)** Dealing with beauty professionals who need to dance around the subject. For example, trendy! With your new fringe."" Trying on a new outfit at a clothing store: ""That looks so... yeah!"" Awkwaaaard.

I try to deal with it by avoiding reflective surfaces (*hiiissssss!*), trying to have a sense of humour about it, and crying into an unreasonably large burrito while watching *Daria*.

Her response was ""well...that depends...if she, she should tell him. But wait..they do have hymen reconstructive surgery, so she should do that"" 

I was shocked. My mom's conservative

I said ""why? so she can pretend to be a virgin? a hymen means nothing anyway. even girls who haven't been raped or have sex sometimes don't have a hymen or don't even bleed. ""

She said ""yes but if she KNOWS she lost her virginity then she should have the surgery. Imagine how her husband will feel knowing that another man had his wife""

My response: ""So a rape victim should go through the distress and throw away thousands of dollars on a SURGERY just so her husband can have the sick satisfaction of knowing his wife bled on her wedding night? you don't care about how she feels? her healing isn't important

She got annoyed with me and said ""ugh

I couldn't stand the discussion so I told her I was disgusted and didn't want to talk about it anymore. 

This morning I was driving with her and she started talking about the CT shooting. She was saying that she watched Dr. Phil who featured the father of another school shooter. The father had said that his son was sexually assaulted before going on his shooting rampage

She said ""he was probably raped by a teacher"" and I said ""or by another student"" and she said ""what? no. students wouldn't rape another male student

Of course I told her how incredibly wrong that is, by anyone. She was shocked at the idea and said 'well girls get raped more because they dress slutty""

At this point I was fuming. And I admit I was raising my voice. I said ""What is wrong with you? What is with this backwards culture that you never left behind? A woman can dress how she wants

And she said ""but she's inviting the rape! if you walk down the street with money in your hands and someone steals it

She continued to talk but I just said ""please just stop.

I was so upset that I started crying. She asked me what was wrong and at this point I was bawling like a baby. I told her nothing

I didn't answer her

I said ""how are you going to help me? are you going to fund my hymen reconstructive surgery?""

And she kept asking ridiculous questions like ""what were the circumstances in which it happened? did it happen here or [our home state]? What were you doing when it happened? Please tell me""

So many posts on this subreddit have the same underlying theme - anger and despair at being boxed in. And rightfully so. We are constantly told what we should be. On the front page right now is a smart woman, even in the subtlest of ways. 

You're fat? Well then you aren't sexy. 

You're skinny? Well having breasts makes you feminine. 

You're a stay at home mom? You're wasting your potential.

You have big boobs? You're either fat or slutty. 

You wear heels? Only for the pleasure of men. 

You like baking? You're a disgrace to feminists. 

You're a lady lawyer? You must be a ball buster. 

You're walking down the street going to class? You're just asking for these lewd catcalls. 

I could go on all day. We are given a lot of grief for the ways in which we don't fit the mold according to our accuser. 

Lets collectively put our middle fingers up and tell the world that we wear many hats and if that threatens you....then be threatened. Because its not our job to soothe the fragile egos of those who are threatened by our abilities.

My cousin is female and in her 30s. She’s tall and beautiful- *really* beautiful- and I’m a bit intimidated by her but she’s always been nice to me. She has chronically low self-esteem.  

As a kid she was naïve, she was in in fabulous shape.  

During puberty she transformed into something ethereally beautiful. She was *stunning*. She stopped people dead in their tracks and left men tongue-tied. She could literally cause traffic accidents just by walking down the street. I’m starting to realize that she didn’t understand this. She didn’t have any idea how beautiful she was. She didn't try to be pretty

In high school she had two female friends. My cousin was two years behind me but we attended the same high school. I remember her friends. One was a lesbian who desperately hoped my cousin would turn out to be gay. The other was a childhood playmate who was viciously competitive. They eventually had a falling out and haven’t spoken in years.  

My cousin was sweet, and broke her heart. Things didn’t get better in college. Two men she trusted- she’d been friends with them since the ninth grade- drugged her and raped her. I guess they subscribed to the “kindness coins =&gt; sex” theory of the friend zone and they figured they’d waited long enough for their reward. When that happened, she didn’t have anyone to turn to for support. (Her mom is out of the picture.) I didn’t find out about it until she and I talked a few days ago. She said I’m the only person besides her husband she’s ever told.  

Throughout her 20s, with her long blond hair, smooth skin and big breasts. Tearing her down made me feel like she wasn’t so much *better* than me. And it made her self-esteem worse.  

My cousin is an emotionally ruined person and I didn’t even know it. She dropped out of college and married a morbidly obese man. I’m not sure if she did it because she was trying to prove something

The crazy thing is

Like most other people, and no one wanted to be her friend. People were blinded by her looks and never saw the person behind the face.

Let’s all take a moment to remind ourselves that NO ONE chooses the face they’re born with. And we all need each other’s support to get through life. We women need to stick together. *All* of us.

If anything

Recently,"" who I met at a bar when I was out with my girlfriends. My girlfriends kept telling me how cute he was, and I never meet guys like this, so I went ahead and gave him my number when he asked and then hung out with him a couple times. It turns out, this guy is BORING. He doesn't have a lot to say, besides, ""You're so cute, when I found out he is a CONSPIRACY NUT who thinks we found alien life forms on the moon that gave us technology for Internet and cell phones and the government hushed it up. Ladies

After a night of just him and me at a bar, saying, ""She's a slut...she's a slut...""  I got really offended, and said that was rude, and besides, how does he know they're ""sluts.""  His answer?  ""Because I've slept with them.""  Of course I told him, ""That means you're a slut."" He didn't get mad, and he was really sorry he was a slut, and I said, I'm planning on never seeing this guy ever again.

The end of that night was bad enough. He got even more sad that I shot him down, then he starts cuddling next to me and kissing my cheek and telling me I'm beautiful, which got really annoying, and then he whispers to me in his most seductive voice, ""I don't care that you friend zoned me. I'll still be your friend. But I'm gonna take you home tonight.""  NOPE. I made my excuses and ran.

That was five months ago.

He moved away suddenly

Until two weekends ago, ""I'm in town. Want to get drinks?"" I was already getting drinks with my girlfriends again, so I agreed to meet him. He saw me at the bar for 5 minutes then left to visit other friends. I thought I handled the whole situation gracefully without hurting anyone's feelings. But then he came back this weekend, and texted me, and I had no plans. That's when I made the dumbest decision of my life. I decided, when he texted me, that I wanted to get laid in the easiest way possible.

This was stupid for many reasons. One is that I know that I'm STD free but I don't know that he is. That night he got drunk and sad and tried to seduce me, and kept condoms everywhere just in case. As if that was the reason I turned him down. Really, ladies, I don't know how I could possibly resist him. Also, I've never done a one night stand before, so I didn't know how to orient myself so I wouldn't end up in a compromising situation. Also, he would in the future point to me and call me a slut. Also, just because I've been horny. I wanted to wham bam thank you ma'am to a boy that intended to do the same to me. Besides

What followed next was awful for all of the above reasons and for one more. I WAS ABOUT TO EMBARK ON AN EVENING OF THE WORST SEX OF MY LIFE.

Let me skip the whole first part, with the friend who accompanied us and then was conveniently left behind once he started to chat me up, with the inevitable proposal from Jake that I end the friendzone and give him another chance. He really really likes me, after all. Never mind that he never talks to me. Ever. He thinks I'm beautiful, and cute, and he called me princess once. I resisted the urge to get drunk to put myself out of the misery for the sake of sex and remained sober so I wouldn't do anything too stupid. (Hah!)

Finally, lips on my cheek, then just as suddenly, on my mouth. I think, this isn't so bad. At least he's not - but then it sinks in. He's a bad kisser. He keeps making short, quick up and down movements with his lips, almost like he's chewing with his mouth partly open. I try to kiss back more to what I want, but would probably feel great

After a while, that I had a long day at work, and was tired? I asked him if we could ""hang out"" at wherever he's staying. He get's the hint immediately and says that we can go to his friends place. We walk back to our cars, but he stops and turns and pushes me against a wall and does that awful kissing thing again. Like fish lips. I'm sure he thought it was really romantic and spontaneous. But I push him off, and say, hey, let's get going, and so we won't have any privacy. But then, but he says he'll pay for it. Whatever. I'll follow him in my car.

The reasons for us going in one car became obvious after five minutes when he starts spontaneously kissing me again (WTF? No wind up or anything?) and he whispers, is filthy, and has untinted windows. No. ""Then let's do it in my car.""

Can I just stop the narrative here for a second, and we were talking about walking in our older brothers doing it in the basement with their first girlfriends. And then we giggled.

Let's see if I can wrap this up more quickly: he escorts me to my car, then he's awkwardly kissing me, and I know what he really wants, but to test him I ask, ""So, are we leaving soon?"" and he says, ""Soon. But you're just so beautiful, I push him away,"" I say

The good news, ladies, and I have been eager to have another. He agrees. And so kisses me in the back of his car (in a secluded parking lot with tinted windows) saying to me such sexy things like, ""Tell me you like me,"" and ""Is it sexy that you can feel my boner."" He's even dropped the tired, ""You're so cute,"" and now the dirty talk is all about him. Just put on the condom already!

He does, across the whole of my vagina, really only across the outer labia, so lightly there isn't any pressure at all, looks up at me and asks, ""Does that feel good?"" When I look at him in disbelief, he does it again, ""Do you like that?"" When I dont' answer, but for you

I'm so tired at this point, who is clearly resistant to the idea. I grumpily ask him why he didn't just tell me that he wasn't comfortable with oral sex. And I push him back on the seat, sit on top of him, and figure I'll work the rest out for myself. And thank god I orgasm, because then I figure he'll finish up, and I can go home.

Only, and continues fucking me, which, for him, means alternatively banging me as hard as he can, and when he gets tired, swirling it around slowly inside me. We're alternating between *ow ow ow* and then, now I feel the presence of your dick inside of me and am receiving no sexual satisfaction at all from it. This is how he keeps his stamina up, I give up and lay limp and hope that he finishes soon.

LADIES

Oh, I could barely breathe. I think the eye rolling helped circulate some of the depleting oxygen in my brain.

Finally he stops. Not because he is actually finished, but he clearly has stamina, and I was not willing to see how long it was going to last.

But then he looks at me weird and asks if I'm ok. I'm worried that my eyes are trapped at the back of my skull. I tell him that I'm very tired and that I suddenly wasn't feeling well, but clearly he wants to make a last attempt to complete my seduction, so he kisses me again (shudder) and starts poking his fingers around my vagina in an attempt to stimulate me back into having pounding, swirling sex with him. I don't think the man has heard of a clitoris, ever.

But I apologize, and I have to endure one more goodnight kiss before I pull away in my car and peel off.

The point is, will get cancer, and die. But really, I think that I just learned that I'm not the wham bam, type. I think that I'll just stick to my vibrator from now on when I have sexual urges. That one little orgasm was not enough to make up for the worst sex ever. Most of these anecdotes on 2XC end with an invitation to share similar experiences, I suppose to keep the subReddit from becoming LiveJournal, so by all means, and hopefully I brightened someone's day or night as they read the hilarious retelling and thanked their lucky stars that they weren't me last Friday night.

TL;DR Had awful one night stand sex with a slightly misogynistic sports idiot. Really

1) Thanks for the other awful horror stories. Here's a shout out to my new favorite person on the Internet
2) I KNOW I did this to myself. I know that in embarking on this voyage I have provided positive reinforcement for this bad sex asshole. I really don't care
3) Why him? Because I wanted to use him. I don't know very many guys. All the rest of them are nice
4) I so deserve it. I have never deserved anything so much in my life. This is karma on a steaming platter served in the luxury compartment of the karma train.

Ladies and gentlemen of /r/twoxchromosomes... I TAPPED THAT. AW. YES. It was awesome. I request the highest of fives. I've never came with a guy before- 3 times mothafuckas.

**UPDATE TO THE UPDATE:** Sorry to be so late in details, he actually came to the student union in hopes that I'd be there. Which is the same reason I was there. So we talked, flirted, ""hugged"", etc all day. 

I fully intended on being the one to initiate the sex stuff, it was too good. It didn't end up being until 5 and ended at 9 (scuba diving, pool session), and he offered to let me study at his place (I hate studying at home). I knew I wouldn't get anything done but I went anyway. Fucked from around 10-12. My legs are quivering, my lady bits are like ""whoa"", I was hardly able to drive home. 

Sorry-- I was in the middle of writing that at 2a and I fell asleep with my phone in hand.

EDIT: I feel I should add- there's a lot of people saying I only fucked him because he sounds like James Deen. I fucked him because I was attracted to him. I started out as just friends. He was just a friend in my perspective- I enjoy his company, gives great hugs. Eventually I started being attracted to him as more than a friend. And then we fucked.

I'm a girl in the middle of an engineering degree at a top 10 university.  Everything I've read, I'd encounter sexism, in forms ranging from really blatant to the things being documented at the Everyday Sexism Project.  I resolved a while ago to do what I could to stop it, but had mostly resigned myself to figuring out a way to deal with it.  I really wanted to be an engineer, and sexism seemed to be something that came with a tech career.

So I was nervous when my boss introduced me to the group I'd be working with this summer

Ladies, that they'd be more than willing to make themselves available if I needed advice or someone to bounce ideas off of, but that they knew I'd be able to handle the tasks on my own.  In meetings, they ask my opinion, and they stop to explain anything I might not know (lots of acronyms, mostly).  I feel young and inexperienced, but I don't feel conspicuously female.

This clinic, making it a dangerous experience for clients to just make it to the front door.  Clients have to park on the street and walk down the sidewalk, or park across the street.  So that gives the protesters a lot of freedom to be pushy and obnoxious.  Today they arrived in swarms, lining up with their rosaries and signs and big flags with the Virgin Mary, and their pamphlets, and their anger.  It's one of only two clinics in the state, and some women have to drive hours just to get here.

My husband and I were given clinic escort vests and a brief rundown - ask people if they want to be escorted, don't touch the protesters (or they'll cry ""assault!""), keep talking even if it's just about the weather, to just keep the client's attention away from the screaming.

Our first client, waited in their car until we got the go-ahead that the clinic was open.  Escorts in our bright vests far outnumbered the protesters, but the protesters were determined to make up for it with volume and vitriol.  She said that she just wanted to jaywalk, and go in as fast as possible.  She had a sweatshirt on, with her hood pulled up.  As we crossed the road, the screaming intensified.  People were EVERYWHERE, a chaotic frenzy of escorts and protesters.  One short woman was suddenly in my face, trying to reach the client.  Screaming about murder

As my husband and I walked back across the street to the parking lot to wait for the next client, having people angrily bumping into each other and just, the raw emotion.  

We ended up escorting one more woman, got to my car, and started to cry.  It all seems so distant when you read about it on TwoX - I've read stories from women who have gotten abortions.  My heart has broken for them from reading their stories.  But actually standing next to someone and being completely unable to shelter them from the pure hatred (I messed up, too - in the heat of the moment as one particularly hostile protester was screaming and waving pamphlets, I put my arm around the client and later got scolded by one of the head volunteers, and rightfully so!, who reminded me that everything about this experience should be under the client's control...I felt so awful about it, to keep all of their awful words and awful signs and awful faces from even reaching those clients.  I felt helpless and overwhelmed.  And utterly **humbled** when I realized that my feelings of helplessness and other emotions were just a fraction of what those clients must feel.  I can't even fathom what emotions they feel as they make this decision.  I was in awe of their strength

As I sat in my car and cried, but I will always remember them.

Lady 1:  I'm sorry my hair is so long. *nervous laugh*

Lady 2:  I'm sorry my hair is so thin...Its hard to work with.

Lady 3:  I'm sorry its so curly.  Is it a problem?

Just as I was about to apologize for my hair being too thick (which I often do - I want to acknowledge that it takes time and I'm a bit embarrassed when they run their hands through it and remark ""wow its so thick!"" without the tone of a compliment attached to it).  I realized all of us had just apologized for things we could not help, long hair, thick hair.  What hair are we supposed to have before we enter the salon?  Perfect hair?  What about when we leave?  Should it be perfect then?  Perfect according to whom?

I just wanted to remind you (as I have to remind myself) that maybe some of us, accommodating, easy to get along with - and naturally go out of our way to do so.  Perhaps we do that too much.  Perhaps when we apologize for something like the thickness of our hair, we are internally acknowledging that that is a problem.  But it isn't.  It isn't a problem.  Hair is not a *problem.*  

For goodness sake.  At some point - whether the conversation is about body size, or money, or babies, or relationships, we can kind of beat ourselves up.  Maybe today (on this FRIDAY) we can agree to give ourselves a small break from it all?  

So, enjoyed the cut and style, paid and left.  As it should be.  Because if my stylist came into my office looking for my help, I would not expect her to apologize and say ""I'm sorry I have this problem.""  Stop being sorry.  Let me do my job.

I identify both as female and as a woman. I've realized that I can be a woman and have traits that are not typically associated with women.

Even as I've realized that what I've spent my life thinking about the word ""woman"" wrong, I now feel more like a woman than I ever did. Because I've realized that I'm a person first, and everything that comes from that defines what kind of woman I am.

How to Be a Girl on the Internet



To be a girl on the Internet, and proud of it. Follow your friends and blogs that post gifs of scenes and quotes from your favorite movies. See a link someone reblogs that directs you to a forum post on a different site, one with a huge userbase, mostly men. You are fine with this, since you’ve always felt yourself to be “one of the guys” instead of “one of the girls.” Read the whole thread and laugh at how funny the users are. Decide to create an account.



Stare at the empty blank box for “username.” You will have several usernames that you use on different sites, you’ll have an epiphany. Towel off and immediately return to your laptop screen. Be impressed by your own wit as you type in “MissEllaneous.” This username is taken. “Miss_Ellaneous.” This username is taken. “Miss.Ellaneous.” This username is taken. “MrsEllenaous.” This username is available.



After several weeks of lurking, this time with a more gender ambiguous name—no words like “princess,” “girl,” “lady” or “Mrs” to identify you.



When you post a picture of yourself in a nerdy Doctor Who sweater you knit, foot, shoulder—will be sexualized. Strangers will feel obligated to inform you whether or not they’d “hit it.” Ignore them when they search your post history for nudes, and, when they don’t find any, ask for them. The other half of the comments will call you an attention whore and tell you not to expect special treatment just because you’re a girl. Decide not to post any more pictures with yourself in them.



Feel creeped out by the disturbing messages people start to send you. Don’t click on the attached link named “my penis.” When, feel disgusted and immediately close out of your browser. Wonder if that makes you a lesbian. Don’t reply to any of them. Start locking your doors and windows at night. Switch accounts when they still don’t stop.



Stumble in a thread about rape. Be appalled when the other commenters tell rapists who write their stories that they aren’t rapists and that the girls wanted it. Read several more pages of comments before turning away from your computer in disgust. Do people really think false accusations of rape are more common than true ones? Don’t trust any of their statistics—they probably pulled them from their asses. Make it a rule to not open any threads that even look like they could lead to more rape discussions.



Correct someone who refers to you as “he.” Get called a “politically correct feminazi.” Google “feminazi.” Wikipedia will tell you it’s “a radical or militant feminist, but superior to them. Get into an argument for the next hour. Even when you leave your computer, the words will stick to your brain like syrup. Realize that you’re voluntarily spending your free time getting angry and frustrated. Stop correcting people.



Figure out the forums where it’s safe to be a girl. Stick only to these parts of the site. Most likely they will be forums for women, ignoring their confused looks. Tell yourself they are just a product of “rape culture” and need to check their privilege—they couldn’t possibly understand these kinds of progressive ideas.



Avoid the most popular, are these opinions ones that most people carry? Become suspicious of everyone around you; wonder what they’re like behind their online personas. Feel yourself losing a little faith in humanity. Wonder if you are really becoming a feminazi.

I was happy to accept an offer for a free personal training session earlier last week


During the session, 1 day cardio at Gym, and 1 day of strength training at Gym. I am not interested in losing any weight (BMI 21, healthy weight for my height, body fat at 21% - low end of normal range for women), but would like to improve my strength training routine and work on toning a bit more. I mentioned that my wedding is coming up in 4 months, and reiterated multiple times that I have no interest in losing any weight and never once expressed dissatisfaction with my personal appearance. 


After the session, I was happy with my training session. However, after the head trainer came in, I the session turned into an attempt to degrade me and make me feel as though I needed to lose weight and am out of shape. Multiple comments were made regarding needing to 'look good in my wedding dress', 'get in shape for the wedding', 'only four months to look good for your wedding day', etc...These types of comments are unacceptable as they are both a) an attempt to sell training based on perceived body insecurity in women and b) completely off-base based on my own comments during the intake session. I work out very consistently


To add insult to injury, well-paying position, and would feel equally offended even if I did not. The high cost of personal training is naturally cause for discussion between my partner and me and has nothing to do with who earns the money. 


I came into my personal training session with the intent on spending up to $400 for Gym's personal training services. However, perhaps I would feel differently. 



Update: I received a sincere apology from the manager at that Gym's location. He apologized several times and has documented the trainer's performance. I am happy I spoke up.

Unfortunately the lecturer also spoke of rape in the Middle Ages and how to kill yourself following rape was a way to protect your virtue. This proved too much for me and I had to leave the room.

   After lectures, and I wanted to know if my tutor felt like we were moving backward in the development of women's rights and feminism. I mean, before this election I had never heard politicians speak of such appalling things as ""legitimate rape"" or prison sentences for women who seek abortion etc. But it was my tutor's response that really put things in perspective. She said: ""we're not moving backward at all. These are just the shrieks of dying dinosaurs who know their era is dead.""

   So the next time I'm attacked on reddit for believing in women's rights, that these people know they are wrong. They're just desperately clinging to crazy ideals to try to stretch out the time they have left for ignorance and intolerance.

1369280264.0,1evs1f,So...my husband was arrested for trying to sleep with a prostitute...,Amvega,2183,839,496,"I decided not to use an anonymous name because this is what I’m going through right now.  I don’t see a need to hide myself.  I’m sure H will read this at some point.  I just don’t give a shit.

WARNING:  I have a lot to get off my chest.  I’m also not very good at formatting.  Please try to keep the grammar police at bay.

On April 19th, he was calling to verify information so that the husband could be released on his own recognizance.  I asked him why H had been arrested, and he said “lewd acts” which could be anything from pissing in public to something sexual.  Ok…  At that point, I still gave H the benefit of the doubt and planned on picking him up in a couple of hours from jail.  I knew he was safe, so I went over to a friend’s house for a beer and to relax before I had to pick H up.  The idea of “lewd acts” kept bothering me, and I decided to see if there was more information about the arrest online.  That’s when I saw exactly what he was arrested for, and my heart felt like it had been ripped out of my chest.  Needless to say

Before you ask

H called me the next morning because he needed contact information or something like that.  He told me that he was guilty for what he had been arrested.  He was mean.  I told him not to come home, but I DO pay the rent.”  I’m a full time university student right now and he supposedly supported me in my endeavors.  It was very apparent to me that he thought his financial contributions outweighed any of my contributions to our almost 6 year relationship.  I found an apartment the day after he was arrested and began the process of terminating our relationship.  (Just for the record, I gave up TWO careers because I chose to be with him.  I don’t regret it because I thought I was making the right decision at the time.  Hindsight is 20/20.)  

Our sex life wasn’t good.  I’ll just throw that out there.  Over the years, and the fact that sex was just plain boring.  To come from a kinky lifestyle to a very repetitious, boring, monotonous sex life was very trying on me.  He wanted more sex than I wanted to give.  At some point, faking attraction gets difficult.  I attended counseling for my lack of attraction and told him that I was working on things.  It wasn’t just bullshit.  I was working on being more affectionate to him.  I even suggested at one point that we open up the marriage.  He flipped.  Now I understand that he was ok with it being open for him, but not for me.  (Fast forward a month, and I realized that my sex drive is VERY healthy.  I fucking love sex.  I guess I just didn’t love it with him.)  I was willing to work on myself because I loved this man and wanted to be a good wife to him.  Other than the sex

This past month, started attending therapy more often, filed for divorce, filed for food stamps (denied), and reached out to several different organizations for guidance and help.  I’m not working, and my primary source of income is my VA Disability.  I’m not lazy.  It’s just important to me that I finish my degree.  I graduate next spring, and I’m not going to let his bullshit hold me back.  The hardest thing is that I’m going through this alone.  I’m not from this town.  I moved here with H for his job.  I don’t have any family here, deception

When H finally came home (before I moved out), he bought those right before he went to fuck a prostitute.  He would regularly get me flowers.  He bought me chocolates the week before he was arrested.  When I confronted him about his lies, he said that he was a compulsive liar.  He lies just to lie.  I had no clue.  My friends and family had no clue.  We all thought H was a great guy who treated me like a queen.  He said this was his first time going to see a prostitute, but I can’t/won’t/don’t believe him.  He’s already proven himself to be a liar.

I look back on our relationship, believable performance of loving, caring, well-adjusted husband.

I went on OKCupid last week to try to meet people closer to my age.  My profile says that I’m looking for activity partners, I saw that H visited my profile.  He already had a profile up looking for casual sex.  My friend suggested I post on Plenty of Fish.  H already has a profile up looking for casual sex there, too.  Out of curiosity, I looked on Craigslist.  Guess what I found…at least this time his post was under “men seeking women.”  We’ve been split up for a little over a month, and he’s already looking to get his dick wet.  Lovely.  He has the nice rental house (I picked it out), and the new car (I picked it out and paid the down payment), the stable job, and I feel like my life is crashing down around me.  How’s that for fair?  

There’s more to this story

This will probably get buried.  I don’t care.  I just had to get this off my chest.  

TLDR:  Husband was arrested for trying to fuck a prostitute.  Turns out he’s a compulsive liar.  I left him.

EDIT:  It looks like there are several things I need to clear up.  It’s ridiculous that I would feel the need to defend myself or my decisions

Point 1:  Finances.  Yes, good paying job.  Yes, I did contribute financially to our marriage.  Last year, I received back-pay from the government for my VA disability.  It was not an insignificant amount.  What did I do with the money?  I paid of our debt.  ALL OF IT.  No credit cards, no loans, nothing.  I paid of his car title loan so that he could get the title back on his car.  I paid for the new couch and loveseat set with the rug, coffee tables and end tables.  I paid for the brand new 46” television.  The new car?  Oh yeah…I picked it out AND paid the down payment on it.  I also paid half of the monthly loan payment on it using my VA disability payment.  We used MY name as the primary on the loan because my credit is better than his.  He refinanced the car under his name alone, I don’t feel bad for paying off his debt and buying the things that make the house he lives in look nice (minus the loveseat – I took that as the couch for my tiny apartment).  I did what I thought was the right thing as a wife.

Point 2:  I keep seeing posts about me being lazy because I wasn’t/am not working and receiving VA disability.  Yeah…that’s not going to fly.  I’ve been accepted to an intensive summer program at my university that will help further my long term goals, but this training program will help me in the long run.  I choose not to be completely short sighted.  I have applied for several part-time student positions at the university to help supplement my income after the training program ends.  Oh yeah…it’s VA (Veterans Affairs) disability that I receive because I got hurt while enlisted in the military.  And, I’m using my GI Bill to attend school.  Definitely not lazy.  GPA is a 4.15 (my school allows for A+).

Point 3:  Sex.  Blah blah blah.  It’s my fault he decided to pay for sex because I wasn’t giving it up enough.  Blah blah blah.  /s  Again…not going to fly.  I absolutely take responsibility for my part in this failed marriage; however, trying to communicate and make suggestions to my partner).  I often brought up our lack of sex life.  It hurt me, too.  His response?  “It’s ok.  Take your time.  I know you’re working on things.”  Lies.  Lies on top of lies.  Furthermore (**this is surely going to get negative responses**), I am under no obligation to sleep with anyone at any time.  This includes my husband, and this includes in marriage.  If I sleep with someone, it’s because I want to.  It may be because I want to pleasure my partner, receive pleasure, it was because I wanted to make him happy.  My duty as a wife isn’t to have sex on command (it wasn’t a D/s relationship, which is why I was diligently working on my issues.  

Point 4:  Everyone who said not to jump into something and look for dates online is absolutely right.  I have changed my profile to say that I am looking for new friends and activity partners only.  I have also changed it to look for men and women.  I don’t want any kind of emotional relationship/attachment right now.  I would like a friend closer to my age

Lady epidemiologist here. The earlier post on maxi pads/sanitary napkins and comments on TSS risk have inspired me to post here to educate those of you who don't already know about the history and true risk of TSS associated with tampon use. 

In the late 1970s, the Rely/CMC-polyester tampon absorbed the natural humidity of the vaginal tissues, increasing the incidence of tearing in the soft vaginal tissue during removal, creating a ""gateway"" for bacteria to enter the bloodstream. The CMC itself (combined with the warm, moist environment inside the vagina) provided the perfect breeding ground for the ""toxin"" that is the most common cause of TSS- staphylococcus Aureus bacteria. One Rely tampon could absorb a woman's entire period, and so many women left them in for days at a time (obviously, we know this is a no-no now, the FDA and CDC quickly discovered that the (specific) use of the Rely (CMC-based) tampon carried a higher risk of staph Aureus infection/TSS than tampons made of other, the higher the risk of TSS. The Rely Brand/CMC tampon was then pulled from the market and the FDA classified tampons as a ""medical device

Tampons nowadays are made with safer materials and very, etc)! The official incidence rate of TSS related to tampon use is 3 cases per 100,000 tampon users (per yr). Relative risk of TSS increases with increase in absorbency, but that doesn't necessarily mean ""Super"" tampons are any less safe than ""Regular,"" IF they are made with the same material and changed at the same rate. The increased risk associated with higher absorbency is: the risk of one material relative to another, less absorbent material (CMC vs. Rayon/cotton, for instance)

Moreover, and other than the smell, they were all fine, if not just totally grossed out. This is anecdotal evidence, of course, but I just want you all to know it is not necessarily a TSS-death sentence if you do have a mishap. 

I hope that you, informative, and helpful! May your next period be light and over in 3 days!!! :)

Although the position is, executive officer position


One thing that had always pissed me off was that our main union-negotiated, in the first three years is when most women need birth control because they’re young women. I mean, a woman who’s been there 15 years isn’t going to be having children due to her age, generally speaking. It didn’t affect me directly, as I was finished having babies and had undergone a tubal ligation. For me, it was the principle of it, and it was a matter of fairness and equality.


The year 2000 was a contract year, so that they can better explain it to their constituents in the plant. Trustees, being lowly peon-officers were not invited, however, my local union sent us anyway. We were told how to sneak into the meeting and also to keep quiet (since we were not supposed to be there). 


The meeting took place in a huge conference room. There were thousands of union officers in attendance,000-3,000. At the front of the room there was a stage set up, with a long table spanning it. Sitting at the table were about two dozen people. All but one were men. These people were Chrysler execs and the national UAW bargaining committee. There was one lone woman sitting at the Chrysler end of the table. The rest were men who were 50 years old and older. The room, where the audience sat, was set up with aisles and in each aisle there was a microphone so that members of the audience could ask questions.


After a couple of hours of the meeting, everyone, smiles! High fives! Pats on the back for all the white haired old fucktards who took care of themselves and their old penises. He went on and on about what a great advancement this was, and how proud they were to have been able to provide this fabulous benefit to their employees. This was The Good Old Boys Club in action.


As I sat there digesting what I’d just heard, he did a facepalm. He knew exactly where I was going and what was going to happen. I didn’t care. I didn’t care that I wasn’t supposed to be in the room, at the meeting, or even in Detroit. I wasn’t letting this shit fly.


I stood by the mic

Me: Am I understanding correctly that Viagra is now going to be a covered prescription?
Him: Yes! Up to twenty pills per month!
Me: Ok, if you’re going to cover one end of sex, don’t you think you ought to cover the other? The two kind of go together, you know. 


First, from every female in the room, including the female Chrysler executive sitting on that stage. I know I was turning 100 shades of red, but I kept going. When the applause subsided, he replied.


Him: We have two plans and the traditional plan covers birth control so if a woman wants birth control she can change plans.
Me: You know as well as I do that the majority of our members have the HMO plan and many cannot change.
Him: We don’t think that covering birth control pills is financially feasible.
Me: Well, and then the delivery, which is covered and which can get VERY expensive if a c-section is required, and then at least 18 years of medical/dental/vision coverage for the kid, since dependents are covered – and that’s only if the kid doesn’t go to college, and if the kid does go to college then you have 4 more years of coverage plus tuition assistance, which is covered. So

Another standing ovation. I was on a roll…I was high as a kite on the response and in knowing that I wasn’t alone in thinking


All he said

After the meeting, John, I was right and you know it, this is bullshit.” He totally agreed, but said, “Couldn’t you have just written a damn letter or something? Jesus, now they’ll be wanting to know who you were and why you were here, and I promptly told them to suck it. 


A couple of months later there was an amendment made to our contract. They began covering birth control for women :)

To this day I feel so proud, for helping thousands of women get birth control. My friend and I still laugh about the frozen expressions on the faces of those men on the stage. It was a beautiful thing.

True story ;)

Edit: I work midnight shift and posted this then fell asleep and am just getting back on. Wow, exactly. It was held at the Hyatt Regency in Dearborn, MI and I looked at their website to see the capacity of their meeting room(s). Their biggest says it holds 1200.

Since I was 12 years old I've been online nonstop. 4chan, webcomics, you name it. I've always been aware of the fact that this would probably give me an ""internet mentality"". I've been spending time on these websites throughout some of my most impressionable years.

For the most part this has made me funny, and the porn, and saw the internet for what it really was: a wonderful place for people to come together and just talk. No matter what it seems like in the rest of this post, I truly love the internet, and I credit it for some of the best traits of my personality.

However, it would have been hard not to, being in middle school spending hours upon hours on /b/. I pretty much just lurked, but all the women-hate totally got to me. 

I found myself thinking ""I feel more like a guy when I'm on the internet."" But I realize now that I really don't feel more like a guy when I'm on the internet. I feel like a person, and reactions. I don't ""feel like a guy"", I feel like a girl with a brain. 

I devalue myself for being a girl too. Over the years, and not do one of those ""annoying things that girls do"" because I owe it to everyone to be a perfect, amazing, level-headed bro all the time. The moment I saw the first ""so /b/, why do you hate women?"" threads on 4chan, my heart sank, and I felt apologetic for my gender as a whole. I remember crying once or twice about how I was sorry, but also it's made me SUPER insecure about myself. I feel boring, that I'm a bitch.

The women-hate is less of a conscious thing on reddit, hated on, or hit on. Now I'm not saying stop misogyny on the internet, that's pretty much impossible. It's something I grew up with and something I've always had in the back of my head. 

I just wanted to share with you all what the anti-women internet mentality does to the brain of a lonely

Nope. Many were, they need to be eliminated, this is what happens when you let Muslims run things, this doesn't happen in civilized places. Yeah. As much as I experienced harassment in Egypt, and it was terrible and it's a huge problem and we should be addressing it, it's both inaccurate and unhelpful to pretend that it's a phenomenon isolated to the Arab or Muslim world. I've experienced street harassment in Europe, and have many female friends who have terrible stories about being harassed while living in Europe. So I brought it up. I countered to one of these posters that harassment is a significant problem in Europe, and it can't be blamed on Arabs alone.

What followed, I was told that my experience was ""bullshit,"" that this man had been to Europe a lot and had never seen street harassment, that I must have mistaken the Italians' flirtatious nature for real harassment. I was dismissed and consistently downvoted every time I tried to explain that this man's impression of harassment in Europe didn't line up with actions that I have had directed at me.

It made me realize what had always seemed so off to me whenever one of the mainstream subreddits seemed to care about women's issues. Whenever they care about street harassment, and they don't care about women's issues at any other time. R/atheism viciously suppresses discussion about treatment of women in the atheist community, other mainstream subreddits treat street harassment like a joke. It's not about the women, it's about the Arab, Muslim men, and even in a discussion on women's issues, the female perspective isn't considered valid. It's like the discussion of women abroad isn't a discussion about human rights, and things don't get a perspective.

1356100355.0,1587jg,Update: Told my conservative Muslim mother I was raped ,,1803,528,140,"I posted [this thread] (http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/153zsg/told_my_conservative_muslim_mother_that_i_was/) about telling my mother that I was raped. 

First of all

**About hijab**: 

I was Muslim my entire life. From the time I was 12-18 I wore the hijab (headscarf) until I ultimately decided I had had enough of it, if you're a female and you ever mention that you're Muslim to another Muslim, you can guarantee that the subject of hijab will arise, why you don't wear it, if you plan on wearing it, etc. Or amongst Muslim men will often be the discussion ""Would you marry a non-hijabi?"" or even if you browse reddit for discussions between Muslim men, you'll see things like ""I met a nice Muslim girl, but she doesn't wear hijab. How do I know if she's modest?""

In fact, I had obnoxious Muslim guys telling me that I did it 'to attract men's attention"" or because I had ""given into"" the Western world's opinion of how women should dress. It was very hard for most people to accept that I simply did not believe in it, or Islam. 

**About the hymen issue**: 

In Islam pre-martial sex is a major sin, a successful business woman, and older than him.

 In fact, and afterwards the verse of the Quran was revealed that required that 4 EYEWITNESSES testify in order to even ACCUSE someone of fornication. Can you imagine having even 1 eyewitness seeing you having premarital sex, let alone 4? So accusing people of fornicating in Islam is in itself very very wrong and unIslamic. Before anyone brings it up, NO, you don't need 4 eyewitnesses if you were raped. Obviously back in the days of the Quran it was much harder to prove than today, but no serious Muslim scholar will argue that modern forensics aren't sufficient evidence in convicting rapists. 

**TLDR; The reason that the hymen issue has become so prominent in Islamic culture is because of the gravity of the sin of pre-marital sex


**Now onto my story update** 

After work the day I had told my mom

I just told her that she needed to trust me when I tell her that that the details aren't necessary

Then she asked me if I was pregnant

Did I check to make sure I wasn't hurt or hadn't contracted any infections?

Yes

She was shocked at that

At that point I felt bad because I knew she was really sad and felt like a bad mother. I told her ""no

and she said ""but I want to be able to protect you. I could've helped you report him or been support for you. and all of those things I said about rape are hypothetical

I told her that I understood she cared about me

She told me ""I'll tell you something. When I got married, and would frequently bring it up, and I didn't want you to deal with that"" 

I told her I understood, sure, we'll see;. 

Finally she told me that she hopes I'll at least be able to talk to my older sister about it

Overall, but I guess some things will take time for her to realize.

I am under eighteen,"" ""unmarried sex is bad,"" and just plain ol' ""sex is bad"" from my peers and from most adults regarding this matter. 

However, he made sure he was going at the right speed, and kept things very relaxed and comfortable. Afterwards, we watched a movie together and he stroked my hair while we cuddled. We've done it twice again since then.

It did not make me depressed, but it also did not make me a woman. PIV sex did not change a single thing except the fact that genitals instead of fingers were inserted into me. If I didn't love him before having my ""Sexual Debut"" with him, I wouldn't love him now. But I did love him then, and I do love him now. 

Not planning on having sex again until I'm prescribed BC or an IUD (better safe than sorry)

Thanks for listening


**EDIT:** Oh god, I am just so happy that I can be part of a breed of women who like sex and aren't afraid to talk about it.

 For everyone who lost their virginity in bad circumstances: virginity is and always has been a social construct. Some people consider losing their virginity having oral sex, sex does not define you. *YOU define you.* Experiment, have fun, do what makes you feel good. ""The second half of the play is usually better than the first"". I just happened to get lucky. Love you, TwoX. Stay golden.

My white

I can't put my finger on it, where rich, white, people go to discover themselves. She goes to yoga classes during the day and tours temples by night. I don't know why it bothers me so much, but it does. Maybe it's because half the guys who have been interested in me were more interested in an ""Indian girl"" than me. Maybe it's because when I was little and participated in my culture, I was considered an outsider by my peers. Maybe it's because India is complex and she's perpetuating stereotypes. 

I really don't know, bypassing the lines and not having to pay any fees. She wrote about it as though it was cool but it just made me angry. She cut in front of people, she got in for free when other people had to pay, just because she's white. I feel like she's not actually experiencing India and understanding what it is, she's just choosing the convenient parts of India that fit her hipster definition of what India should be.  

I'm not sure why I'm taking this so personally. I feel like her dumbing down India to a bunch of stereotypes without realizing it, and I'm Indian but I'm also more than that. Does that make sense? The fact that she is doing this unintentionally and harmlessly almost feels worse, because she doesn't realize she's wrong. Just like the people who have boxed me into a little ""Indian girl"" box don't realize they're wrong. They're not actively picking fights, they're just having conversations with their arsenal of facts. The sun is a star, the earth is a sphere, Indians are spiritual and magical. So it doesn't even occur to them that they might be wrong, because they have no reason to think that.

Many also implied that a man exposing himself is not threatening

When I was still a kid (14) a 40-something year old man exposed himself to me in a parking lot. HAHA so funny, I was petrified and small and knew that I wouldn't stand much of a chance if he was able to get me into a secluded area where he could possibly attack. The only thing I could think to do was memorize the plates on the car and book it.

Luckily as I ran, though he plead guilty prior to the trial). I don't know what would have happened if I hadn't come across the police, how far he would have kept following, or if he would have dragged me into his vehicle once I reached a more deserted area. I looked up his record later to find he had been charged with violent crimes in the past.

A man exposing himself is always a potential threat because the situation can quickly escalate into a full on assault, having to come home with the police and explain what happened to my parents, and later in detail to a prosecutor, was humiliating and, to some extent, traumatizing. 

The point of me posting this is not to say whether the guy in the picture was a threat or not or to discuss his actions specifically, though it seems that many people view it as immature at worst. Of course many men and women already realize this, but not all of them. Sometimes I feel like brushing off or excusing actions such as exposing oneself to an unwilling bystander allows institutional sexism to continue. By affirming, and not condemning such actions, we are saying, hey its okay to make women feel uncomfortable because it's just how things work. 

Anyway, I consider the action threatening because it can and sometimes does lead to a more serious offense. It could have escalated in my situation had I not found help.

I was in no possible way going to get back with him, ever. We got into an argument and he proceeded to verbally accost me, tell me I was a dirty slut, a desperate whore at the club, etc. All of this was assumed from the very vague answers I gave when he was asking about hook-ups I'd had. 

He was always verbally abusive to me, and I haven't spoken to him since. I will not associate with someone who treats other people the way he does, and I finally feel free of him. I feel so much better about myself. This is the longest I haven't spoken to him and it is the best decision I've ever made.

On Friday night I had gotten some dinner with a friend, pulled up my skirt, and sexually assaulted me. Luckily, it was 7:00 PM, so there was someone in the convenience store so I managed to push the man off and run inside for help. My attacker was arrested.

Because there was a clear surveillance camera, and a friction burn from where he ripped my panties off) but I did not need any medical treatment besides the basic EMT care, so I went home. 

I called my boyfriend and he had no idea what to say to me. He was very quiet and our conversation only lasted for five minutes, I called my boyfriend again for some comfort and he was over at his cousin's house. He said he didn't want to seem rude to his cousin and her friend, so he had to be quick. I said that it's not rude because it is a legitimate reason to talk to me. He said it was, but he didn't want to tell his cousin the reason why he was on the phone.

On Sunday morning, I called him on Skype and we were talking when he called me a feminazi (he says it was a joke). I flipped out on him, because I am a feminist, and obviously I was offended. I only wanted to actually talk to him about what happened Friday night, but he ""doesn't know what to say"" and ""He'll only fuck it up"". So now it's Monday afternoon and we still haven't spoken. I just want to die, but I know suicide isn't an option (I'm currently in therapy).

Until last night. She gets a text message. Guess who it is?

You got it. It's Bar Guy. Bar Guy asks if she remembers him. Then

Now

She says sure. Now, she would have just turned him down and it would have been done. But she had gotten stood up twice with no explanation. Now it was his turn. She tells him she'll see him at the bar at nine. 

He replies

IF YOU'RE LUCKY. 

It's on now. A no-show date is not enough. His punishment must be more severe. 

A plan is hatched. We go to the theatre where we work and fill up a huge hot pink balloon with helium. She writes on it

Our friend Riley executes our plan. Riley walks into the crowded bar and calls his name. 

""BAR GUY. BAR GUY? IS BAR GUY HERE?""

He's sitting at the bar. He raises his hand. Riley strides over to him and hands him the biggest

He reads the balloon

I work in a veterinary hospital, just stepping over it.  He said he had stopped at one other hospital before ours, but they wouldn't take her.  He had been driving around for a while with this dying kitten.  He couldn't take it to the humane society because he is tracked by GPS and was only taking her to places on his route.  He felt very bad for her and didn't think she would make it.  We told him we would take care of her.  

My coworker went to get her out of the truck, Pulse/ox, blood pressure, and temperature monitors.  Her heart rate was very low (50), normal cats are 180-200.  Her body temperature was 82.2 (normal temperature for a cat is 100-102).  She was completely lateral.  We thought she was going to die. We did not intubate her as she wasn't quite sedate enough for that, so we put an oxygen mask on her, then switched it to just a low flow (that's what that thing is in front of her face) and placed an IV catheter in her.  We also used something called a bear hugger, assuming it was very low.  We did some bloodwork on her and she does have some abnormalities.  Finally after about an hour, but not in the clear yet.  I don't know if I'm going to keep her

**edit.**  Thanks guys for all your nice responses!  [The kitten is doing better today](http://casey0402.imgur.com/kitten_2#33XQS).  When I woke up this morning she was sitting up and eating on her own.  It also looked like she may have drank some water on her own overnight.  I was worried about her kidneys, he runs away.  She keeps trying to make friends with him... walking up and rubbing against him, meowing at him.  It's really cute.  We didn't do any more bloodwork, we will probably give her a couple more days and then do bloodwork again.  She is very underweight, she is only 1.4 lbs and she should weigh around 3.  But she is willing to eat, and seems to be staying hydrated.  Thanks everyone.

**edit #2 - 9/29/11.**  Thanks to those who are following her progress!  She is doing much better.  Today the delivery man had stopped in to see how she was doing, this is great"" with a huge smile.  She is eating a lot more now, and also eating on her own.  Still a long road ahead for her, but she is doing much better than expected.  My boss told us again today that this is a miracle kitty.  In his 30+ years of practicing, he's never seen a kitten with a body temp that low actually make it.  Thank you everyone :)

Well, and a decent amount of stretching, they both fit.

As they should have.

And he was . . . horrified.  I'm not sure if it was one of those things that sounded better in his head before trying it or what

""Wow, you were tighter than that or something.  Jesus.  I think I fucked up your vagina.  How is sex going to work from here on out?  Because I can't imagine this is going to feel the same again.""

Well, but fuck you, new boyfriend).  

My thing is: how do people not understand how a vagina works?  Do you not realize that a *newborn human baby* needs to come out of that thing when women give birth?  That it needs to stretch and be elastic for that to occur?  And that since women are capable of getting pregnant multiple times

**TL; DR: My boyfriend was shocked that my vagina stretches and it made me feel bad.**

EDIT: Wow, I did try to discuss it with him briefly.  ""You know that, like, a vagina is also meant for a *baby* to pass through it, right?""  He said, ""Right, but still.  Christ.""  I said, this is not a weird thing.  It's normal.  It's normal that it was able to stretch like this.  It's not going to forever be in a place where two dicks can just slip right into it.""  He said

EDIT 2: He's 25, both worldly. 

EDIT 3: After reading through some of the comments

EDIT 4: Not being able to think because he wants sex is a ridiculous excuse.  Do you not think women go through something similar?  Where we're all fired up and ready to go and *fuck all* that gets in our way?

1371698294.0,1gpcpd,Thoughts from a nurse on how obesity being recognized as a disease will affect women,missandei_targaryen,1509,367,796,"So some of you may have seen that obesity is now going to be recognized as a disease by the American Medical Association, but that's just my opinion. Whats bothering me is how the lady blogs I frequent are handling it. 

They're not discussing the medical reasons behind the decision. They're not concerned with how this will affect treatment. Most of these bloggers have little to no medical education or background. No

I'm going to stop right there and say that obesity is not a male or female issue. So there's that to start with. But just to play along

I can't speak for all health care workers, doctors, nurse practitioners, and physician assistants will treat overweight and obese patients with disdain, give them dirty looks, insinuate that they should ""just go on a diet"" or ""just exercise some more,"" and ignore the real problems that lead to obesity. But I'm just here to give my view on it

I don't care how you look. I don't care that you are overweight. What I care about is when people hide behind their feelings as a way to avoid the real issue with obesity- your health. This country puts so much emphasis on looks that we like to forget that obesity is a *health* issue, and they just don't have it in them to change. Other women hide behind a sense of confidence, claiming that they're happy the way they are, that they're healthy still, and fuck off to anyone who says otherwise. They're big and beautiful and dammit if anyone thinks they can put them down because of it. 

I'm going to be completely blunt. How you feel about your weight is **not** an issue. It is irrelevant. If you think I'm wrong, and ask those women who are paralyzed on one side how they feel about their body image. Or better yet, go to a surgical unit and ask someone who just got their foot amputated how they feel about being stigmatized due to their weight. Confidence will not prevent the high blood pressure that leads to stroke and heart failure. Your feelings will not affect the diabetes that leads to recurrent infections, blindness, amputations, and death. 

Harsh, or seeing them develop incontinence because they're unable to get to the bathroom on time with their crutches. I don't like seeing my aunt, who is the most loving and caring person in the world, sleep on two pillows because her heart can't pump her blood fast enough to keep fluid from building up in her lungs, causing her to start drowning in her own blood plasma when she lays down at night. And I don't like having to have this talk with patients who refuse to do anything about their weight because of some reason related to their feelings. The emotional reaction to obesity is certainly an issue with treatment. But let's address it, talk about it, and work on fixing it. Let's support each other through the emotional ups and down. Let's not hide behind it.

As women, verbal abuse, and mockery on a daily basis. But that shies in comparison to the health problems that not all, but **most** obese patients develop. These health issues are no joke. Stop thinking about your feelings, and start thinking about your health. Because believe me, **the people who love and care about you the most don't give a damn about how you look in a bikini.** They want to see you healthy, happy

**TL;DR** How you think about your weight is irrelevant compared to how it affects your health. Women should support each other to tackle this as a health issue

Also, and 2. That's exactly the sort of emotions-first reaction that I'm pointing out as counterproductive to the real issue.",,False,,t5_2r2jt,False,,

We've been in a LDR for a couple years and I've always made sure to keep myself covered, there are stretchmarks from pregnancy and I hate the sag that has come since I have started losing weight (40lbs down 65 to go). He has always made me feel like the most beautiful woman on the face of the earth

Today on camera, he didn't recoil, he told me I was beautiful, ""a true sight to behold"", he showered me with such love and patience and I freaking lost it. I sat down and sobbed, I shook, I cried harder than I have ever cried in my life, fear, acceptance and some I cannot put words to

I have had past partners comment that I would have such a pretty pussy if it hadn't been so beat up, I know they were immature assholes that based their opinions on all the porn they watched but that shit hurt and it sticks with you and I'm sure there are women here who understand how easy it is to be insecure in the look of your genitals. And God knows pregnancy does not do good things to the belly, and a nasty postpartum depression thanks to an abusive ex and I gained a lot more weight than I care to think about and all of it lead to me feeling like the most hideous monster on the face of the earth whenever I was undressed. 

I'm still scared, he's been so supportive. Part of me is terrified that he was just being nice and really finds me to be ugly, but I know that is my insecurity talking and projecting and that he really does love me.

To all the ladies (and men) out there, to someone you are beautiful. To all those who are confident in your body, regardless of size, scars, stretchmarks, whatever, especially those that don't fit into the conventional ideals of what is beautiful...I commend you and am more than a little jealous, because you're courage and confidence helps others find their own beauty.

Okay...I'm off to go cry some more and try to find a way to show my SO just how much I love and appreciate him.

**edit** wow, please know, you really are beautiful and there are people that will appreciate you for all you are, flaws, scars and all. I love you all!!!

**edit2**This has truly been an overwhelmingly beautiful experience, please know, you truly are beautiful.

For goodness' sakes

And I wasn't able to use tampons. For years I thought tampons were just for 'married people.' Or girls who had already had sex. 'The only reason these young american girls can use tampons is because they're all sexually active' (my mom).
I was too embarrassed to tell any friends or try to get any help... I mean

But I was frustrated! I tried having sex- nothing would ever go in and it would hurt. Having oral performed on me was annoying. It didn't feel good. And forget about fingering myself HAHA. My entrance was way too small for that

Then I got a yeast infection
My mom bought some for me and I was like 'uh
And then suddenly it went in...

I was shocked and surprised and ecstatic. TRIUMPHANT! The monistat applicator went in smoothly and IT DIDN'T HURT. It felt normal. And then I pushed the medicine in and gently took the applicator out. And I was like '...... I did it.' It wasn't even that hard! I went to the gynecologist at my school before

But I applied my yeast medication three times! And you know what? After my infection was gone

Just the other day, her entire demeanor changed. She looked gorgeous in the dress--it suited in slim build, and the bright color flattered her--but she felt self-conscious in it, because it had a bit of a v-neck and seemed to think that it emphasized her smaller bust. It broke my heart to see her optimism and excitement wilt so quickly because of a dress.

These experiences have really gone to show me that women of all sizes feel bad about their size, and speaking to them, I find that they're so interesting and funny and sweet. To see these women, who I would have imagined as such confident ladies, falter so quickly because of how they look in one particular outfit, is incredibly upsetting. It reminds me of all the times I've spoken badly about my body--how I've only-half-teasingly talked about how hard it is to find cute clothes for my pear-shaped body or spoken poorly of my small boobs--and it makes me want to start being more positive. 

All of my insecurities have been cropped up because of a failure to meet an ideal which really doesn't exist. In our society

So next time you go shopping, that would make you more beautiful or worthwhile as a person. Find the things that you love about your body and focus on emphasizing those. It's important to buy clothes which flatter you, but ultimately, the clothes that will make you appear most beautiful are the ones which make you *feel* beautiful. I never see customers look more radiant than they do when they find something that just overwhelms them with happiness.

This guy sits next to Olivia and they strike up a conversation.  All is going pretty well until he starts to rub her back.  She says ""I have a boyfriend

Guy freaks the fuck out:

""What the fuck is your problem?  This is none of your business.""

""It's always my fucking business when someone asks you to stop touching them and you don't.""

""You're a fucking bitch.""

At this point I'm like ""Ok, so the manager stands close to us behind the bar and fakes washing dishes.  

My husband told me he called me a fatass whore when I walked off.  I am not a fatass

""NO YOU FUCKING PSYCHO CUNT BITCH!""

Manager goes ""EXCUSE ME. DID YOU JUST CALL HER A CUNT?  YOU CAN GET THE FUCK OUT.""

Guy was like ""Hey manager I'm just fucking around...blah blah...""

Manager was like ""Fuck around somewhere else then

Anyway.  He left while screaming obscenities

TL;DR Some people are assholes

Also

Lol.

That is the worst trolling ever. A.) fatass whore was the terminology used. B.) get raped is just something women tend to hear on the Internet these days--not that its ok by any means...Doesn't make it ok

I was hanging out with my male friend last night, and she certainly didn't want to tell her mom. My friend and I immediately left to go to a Walgreens with a 24 hour pharmacy, get the morning after pill, and rush it to her.

We get to the pharmacy and there are all sorts of sketchy types around, but I requested that he be the one to buy the pill, because if by some WILD stretch of probability, the pill made his sister sick or something, I didn't want to be liable. I googled ""can men buy morning after pill"" and found that yes, as long as they provide proof that they're over 17 years old, they can buy it. I left my wallet in the car since I wouldn't be needing my own ID.

As we waited in line, the pill wasn't for me! And anyway, my poor guy friend was very nervous and stressed out and had no idea what he was doing, and I wanted to be there with him. So renewed with confidence, we waited our turn, not really expecting to have any trouble.

Finally our turn, and the pharmacist, a man of about 40 with a big gold cross hanging from his neck, got the box and came back to the counter. He asked to see my friend's ID, which he did. The man then looked and me and said, ""IS THIS FOR HER?"" Yes. Seriously. I was appalled, but I'm naturally a very non-confrontational person, ""No

The man said, ""No, you don't. As long as the buyer is over 17, regardless of whether it's a man or woman, you can sell it to them. You don't need to see the woman."" The guy gave me a smug, suspicious look, and I could tell that he ""knew"" that I was the shy, and that it was for me. He then proceeded to refuse to sell us the pill unless he ""saw the girl's ID and she was here"". 

Normally, ""Fine, it's for me then. I'll get my ID."" I ran to my car, got my ID, and shoved it in his face, just thinking, ""YEAH, aren't you fucking clever. You've successfully shamed me

Long story short, and if this ever happens to you, or your significant other, or a friend, or some guy you know, know that you can stand up for yourself. You do not need to identify yourself as ""the pill taker"" if you, or any of your friends that are of-age, are buying the pill. 

On one hand, and people that don't know the law and don't stand up for themselves (like my poor guy friend) are getting screwed. But I'm also vibrant right now...I'm feeling *alive*. I know my rights now, and I know the email address to the ACLU of Texas and Walgreens corporate headquarters. I'm going to fight to end shit like this, and I'm telling everyone I know.

Info about the Plan B pill: http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/PostmarketDrugSafetyInformationforPatientsandProviders/ucm109783.htm

There is no reason for anyone, even if the pharmacist has ""moral issues"" with it. From http://www.tsbp.state.tx.us/planb.htm :

""Currently, he/she should refer the patient to another pharmacist at the pharmacy, if possible, or refer the patient to a pharmacy where the patient may obtain the medication. ""

A few people asked for an update

Yesterday I called the company back

I started the conversation by explaining who I was (an interviewee) and that I believed one of his employees may be putting his company at risk for legal action. He got a bit defensive until I explained that I was not personally interested in suing him

He asked me to tell him exactly how the conversation went, and ten minutes later was back on the phone. 

The first words out of his mouth were ""I am so very sorry this happened to you Miss InKitchen

I said that all I wanted was that she was made aware of what she had done wrong, and that if I'm still interested he'd love to schedule me for another in-person interview. 

I explained that I didn't think I would be a good fit for office tranquility if the other woman were to stay employed, and anyone else treated like you by one of my employees, deserves a sincere apology. I will not allow just a scripted 'I'm sorry' and a signature.""

Due to the sensitive nature of the situation I don't know what happened with other applicants or my interviewer

Thank you everyone who commented and messaged me with support, and well wishes! You are an amazing community and and pretty awesome individuals.

1361162782.0,18qetg,"My private Photobucket albums were ""ripped"" and posted to a porn site this week. I wanted to share the anonymous message I got informing me about it, and talk about privacy, exploitation, and the shaming of female sexuality.",fittles,440

I am hardly upset about strangers seeing me nude. What I wanted to share are the deeper implications and what really bothered me about this situation:

1. The hackers for and viewers of this site expect me to be ashamed, this could hurt me in pursuing a career. Why should it hurt my career that someone did something shitty to me? My body is not obscene. It is not shameful. And it most definitely should not be a source of outrage for anyone else. These situations are a shame on the people who seek out ways to exploit women and use their bodies against them. They are not a shame on the women who have the gall not to be veiled in their private moments.

2. Images of naked women who actually want those images public are abundant

3. The hypocrisy of those in our generation who are outraged by things like SOPA, but delight in and defend things like creep shot forums and exposing women.

I did not push the issue, and he seemed very comfortable in the face of what he perceived as vulnerability from me.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I have a few general pleas and reminders to anyone reading this:

1. Please remember to respect the privacy and dignity of all people.

2. Please try to recognize when you objectify a person and find yourself wanting to downplay the fact that they are humans living human lives.

3. When viewing porn

4. Please be conscious

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Background:**

I had a private Photobucket album that was just a personal archive for myself. It had pictures of myself wearing outfits I like so I could look back on uninspired days

It seemed safer than just keeping them in a folder on my computer

I didn't use it very often and almost never linked images from it anywhere

At the beginning of this week I got an anonymous message on Facebook, of which maybe a dozen were nude.

I hesitantly answered and an unfamiliar young woman was standing there. She quietly asked me to call the police. I asked what was wrong and she simply said

Then her asshole (ex)boyfriend showed up at my front gate (I'm so glad I have two big dogs in my yard) and started yelling obscenities at both of us. These small-minded dirtbags do not intimidate me—I know their type—and I yelled back. I know where he works and I know his landlord (this idiot just moved in next door). He'll be unemployed and homeless soon enough if I have anything about it—if he doesn't end up in prison first.

I took pictures of the goose egg over her eye while he yelled, I am!"" and then he rode off on his bicycle.

I called 911 again as they were taking a while. A motorcycle cop from the next town showed up to stay with us until the local force came by. When she told him her attacker's name, I know him. I tazed him once."" The local cops showed up shortly after and took her statement, got my name, and took pictures of her injuries. She was still trying to minimize the whole thing and I urged her not to sugarcoat it. All the local cops know this guy; they said they've been dealing with him since he was 18.

Turns out she has a ""no verbal abuse"" protective order against him (I didn't even know there was such a thing) and he is on probation for previously breaking her arm. She's reluctant to press charges even now

He had called the police from down the street to file his own report; he was promptly arrested.

I shared with her my history of abuse and how I overcame it. I didn't hold back. The cops even told her to get out before something bad happened

She said the cops seemed a little mad at her; I told her they hate domestic violence more than anything and it's very frustrating for them and they just want her to understand the gravity of the situation. I felt like I, but I feel very strongly about domestic violence, child abuse, and animal cruelty. I've been in abusive relationships, I've done rape crisis counseling in the past, I've been involved with animal rescue, and I care about what happens to her and she needs to take this very seriously. She's already given this guy too many chances and he's not going to change. When the lead cop left, ""Don't coddle her."" I told him

She said she was embarrassed to go to her family and I told her she had no need to be. Even though they hate this guy and they may seem upset with her

She's pregnant by this guy and admitted she has a drinking problem that is exacerbated and enabled by him. I offered to go with her to an AA meeting if she'd like (I know what some people think about the program

So that was my morning! In addition to dealing with my elderly mother's fall and broken hip and my dear elderly neighbor undergoing extended emergency open-heart surgery

If that jackass shows up at my gate

Thanks for letting me vent.

P.S. The gal told me he already has three kids he's not in touch with. I spoke to the neighbor in the front house and they said he'd bragged that he already had two felony strikes against him (I looked him up in two local counties' court systems and this appears to be bullshit). I spoke to the landlord over there and he told me he'd already begun eviction proceedings.

-There is a clear point I'm making here. I'm not bitching about friend zoning

-That being said I agree that it's a mis-used term because it does happen (I've friggin seen it people, but to rationalize someone not being interested in you as ""being friend zoned"" is pathetic and immature. No one is obligated to date anyone and if you feel like you're being emotionally taken advantage of then be a big kid and exit the situation - no one is forced into being ""friend zoned"".

I just got out of the hospital a couple of weeks ago. I am supposed to be drinking a lot of liquids and I've been doing my best.  It's certainly not the worst problem

Today I left a little early from work. It's my boyfriend's birthday, so I was in a rush to get to the store and get home to start cooking. While in the car, I feel the urge to pee getting stronger by the minute, but there isn't much I can do about it now. Like any adult, I can just hold it until I get into the store and use their restroom. 

By the time I get there, trying my best to move only my calves because I am clenching my thighs so tightly. Of course, the bathroom is at the back of this huge, fancy store. Oh, did I mention that this is a beautiful, high-end grocery store that I have been frequenting for years, so everyone there knows me? I really should have. So as I duck walk/run to the back of the store

Finally, right in front of the door, my body betrayed me. As I grasped the handle, I started peeing. I rushed in, undid my jeans and sat on the toilet, but  was far, far too late. The entire floor was covered in pee. My shoes were soaking. Thank god my dark jeans didn't look it

I cleaned up the best I could (both myself and the bathroom) and practically sprinted out of the store. I stopped only to tell the customer service desk that it looked like ""someone"" had an accident in the bathroom and that they should chevk it out. I actually almost slipped on the puddle still outside the bathroom *shudder*.

I called my boyfriend on my way home, a bath, and some time weeping quietly to myself.

1371959224.0,1gw47k,My vagina eats Diva Cups for breakfast,stubbornvagina,1310,277,281,"Hi everyone

For several months, seeking out success stories and failures alike.  The failures (extreme difficulty inserting, the need for medical attention for removal, etc.) seemed to be few and far between, with most people only experiencing minor inconveniences during their first few attempts at using the cup.  So I handed over my 45 dollars to the cashier when purchasing my new Diva Cup and Diva Wash with the confidence that I would never have to spend another cent on pads or tampons, even if the cup was a little tricky to begin with.

Unfortunately, sitting on the toilet, lying down) to the slightly uncomfortable (bent over with blood rushing to my head, lying down with knees pulled to my chest, lunging as if I were starting a race) to the ridiculous (one leg up on a high kitchen counter).  My attempts spanned three cycles, but not one was successful.

Finally, punch down fold but inserted with the folded part facing down.)  My first few hours with the Diva Cup were blissful—no leaks and I couldn’t feel a thing.  I reveled in my modern womanhood and, I’ll admit, I even looked forward to getting up close and personal with the products of my menses later when I planned to empty the cup and then dutifully reinsert it for a leak free slumber. Before I went out for the evening, I wanted to do a quick check to see if the cup was getting full.  As I searched around with digits of varying length and finally located the stem and tugged, I thought, “Hm, but this seems like removal will be more difficult than I thought. Oh well

As I suspected, and it was proving very difficult to manipulate the cup into a more unobstructed position while simultaneously trying to break the suction and pull.  I knew I hadn’t been practicing Kegels for nothing, though, and I tried to lend my fingers a hand by bearing down.  I tried not to panic each time the cup slipped from my grasp, and I made myself laugh by thinking of Mrs. Doubtfire saying “Make a pincer!” as if Pierce Brosnan and I were trying to rescue dentures from a wine glass. The cup did finally clear my pubic bone, and I was somewhat relieved despite still being unable to pull it out.  However, now I was more determined than ever to get the cup out before I got out of the shower, and I dragged myself out of the shower to get some air.  On the way, hoping that the cup wouldn’t perform a disappearing act during the night.

The next morning I had a limited amount of time to excavate before work, medical or otherwise.  After work I spent over an hour locked in the bathroom poking, prodding, and, unfortunately, pinching.  My previous attempts had left my most delicate area rather irritated, and my tired fingers kept catching the swollen tissue surrounding the intruder.  With each fleeting tug of the stem, but what was worse for me was the idea that it would be markedly more painful once I (or whoever I recruited for the next invasion) did get a firm grip.  Finally, but I decided that it was about time that this issue was taken care of. At this point I was so embarrassed and upset that I considered going to the clinic alone.  I balked for several minutes before finally breaking down and telling my parents what was going on.  At age 26, I decided that it was finally time to go to the clinic.  They were expecting me since I had explained my very strange problem over the phone in order to confirm that they would treat me.  I sat in the waiting room and filled out the new patient forms and tried to figure out what the visit would cost me.  

When I got into the exam room, it would probably be great, but I wasn’t particularly enthusiastic.  The doctor came in and seemed confident that he’d get the cup out without much trouble.  He went to the task at hand and was very kind and supportive while tearing apart my insides.  Like my many attempts to insert the cup, the doctor tried a few different methods to remove it.  First he tried using a lighted speculum and long thin forceps (apparently this is the “usual” method for situations like this).  The speculum, which is normally just uncomfortable during a run of the mill gynecological exam, was not sharing real estate well with the cup and was very pinchy.  Once the doctor got a hold of the cup with the forceps and pulled, the suction didn’t break and the pain was shockingly bad.  He tried that several times and it was terrible each time.  I was beginning to panic and begging him not to pinch my insides with the forceps.  Each time I let out a noise of pain, inserted far too many fingers for my taste, was the winning method.  Finally my vagina relinquished its broken and bloodied prey.  My menstrual blood splattered all over the exam table, being a cup user herself

I don’t know if I will ever try a menstrual cup again.  The idea of using one is, it did its job well enough to keep two days worth of flow from, well, flowing.  But I can’t imagine trying one again anytime soon.  This experience was traumatic, painful, and embarrassing. Oh, and it was expensive: $45 for the cup and wash, and $26 for the prescription. Oh

**TL;DR** My journey with the Diva Cup ended in the urgent care clinic...so be careful.

**Edited to add:**  I said some of this in responses below, and I understand since it seems that for the most part people have very, very positive experiences with them (or at least don't end up in urgent care and save themselves some mess with pads). It's easy for less than positive experiences to get swept under the rug in communities devoted to a particular product or philosophy.  And I appreciate people responding with their positive experiences when readers post that they will now never try one. But!  Please don't assume that I was standing in my bathroom sobbing, legs shaking like a newborn fawn while trying to insert and remove the cup.  I did follow the directions and advice about proper use, and I was not freaking out until I realized that I should probably get medical attention.  It wasn't super clear in my original post because, I'll admit, I sacrificed some of the more technical details so it would be a bit funny and readable and not-so-traumatizing, it was positioned correctly very close to my vaginal opening.  Once it had migrated upward, so I needed to move it to get my fingers further up around the cup.) Unfortunately, the suction wouldn't break

P.S.  The nurse also said that even though my removal sounded painful, have to order it all the way from Canada!  AND my sister still plans to use hers, though she was sympathetic and slightly weary.  Apparently her canal is more akin to those of Venice and mine is a major trading conduit, but she's never had a problem and loves her Diva Cup.

When the doctor asked my boyfriend and I why we had made the decision to get an abortion

In July I had a copper coil (IUD) fitted. I thought about it a lot

Unfortunately my coil wasn't fitted properly

But I knew that was unfair on her

I read a thread on AskReddit which was full of stories of why people were unable to bring a child into the world and that is why they felt they had to have an abortion. And I just wanted to share my story about a couple who are technically able to but choose not to bring a child into the world. That we are in love, plenty of money, a good education and a desire to start a family one day. But not now. That's why we had decided to use contraception.

I know that some women get pregnant by accident and they suddenly want that child, which we did everything we could to prevent.

So I am very sad, but that I have decided to not have children at this moment in time.

Anyone going through a similar experience my heart goes out to you. And any woman who had an experience like this change her mind and made her want to bring a child into the world - congratulations. I hope that everything will work out for all of us.

Edit: a few people have asked why I am not considering adoption (and strangely all deleted their comments) so I thought I would add my response to the original post: The reason I am not going to create a life and bring a child into the world in order to have it adopted is that there are thousands

**Second edit:** I'm leaving for the hospital in about an hour and felt so lucky to wake up to all of these insightful comments, but as soon as I can I will speak to you all. Thank you so much. And I hope I haven't scared women who have the IUD too much! I'm getting another one and hopefully this doctor will be a bit better at it.",,False,,t5_2r2jt,1359108096.0,,

1358140327.0,16jabj,I've noticed there are a lot of questions here about pregnancy and birth control,happyplains,1298,271,264,"I see many posts here every day asking about pregnancy and birth control.  I thought some of you would find it helpful to have some general information about the menstrual cycle

I’m a few months away from finishing my PhD in neuroendocrinology.  My thesis topic is how the menstrual cycle and hormonal birth control affect the brain and behavior.  I am also 12 weeks pregnant (on purpose

I’ll start by addressing common questions, how pregnancy is detected, and finally how pregnancy is prevented. 

**Questions that I see here basically every day**

* **Am I pregnant?**

If you had sex **edited to add:** with a male-bodied person any time in the last 42 weeks, abstinence really is the only 100% effective form of birth control.  Even used correctly, every single birth control method except abstinence has failed at least once.

So asking if there’s a chance you might be pregnant is not really a useful question.  What you want to know is how likely it is that you are pregnant.  And that depends on a number of factors.

If you want to know if you’re pregnant

*  **I had completely unprotected sex.  What are the chances I’m pregnant?**

The most important factor in answering this question is whether you had sex within the 5 days before you ovulated.  [Here is a chart showing the likelihood that you were in your fertile window during each day of the menstrual cycle](http://www.bmj.com/highwire/filestream/432373/field_highwire_fragment_image_l/0/F1.medium.gif) if you have no other information about when you might have ovulated.

Contrary to popular belief, see 1 above.)

*  **I have an irregular cycle/PCOS/very long periods

YES.  Ovulation is harder to predict during irregular cycles

*  **I’m not using any regular protection

Withdrawal is a lot better than nothing.  [Used perfectly, yes, you could still get pregnant.

* **My partner didn't come inside me

Some evidence suggests that there is [little to no viable sperm in pre-ejaculate](http://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/2137833?uid=3739560&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=4&amp;uid=3739256&amp;sid=21101528712153), your partner should urinate before sex to clear any potential sperm out.  Even with this precaution, it's still possible that you could get pregnant, but it is not very likely. 

*  **I have sore breasts/fatigue/nausea/other symptoms

No symptom or constellation of symptoms can tell you if you are (or aren’t) pregnant.  The only way to know if you’re pregnant is to take a pregnancy test.

* **I took a pregnancy test and it was negative.  Could I still be pregnant?**

It depends on many days it has been since you ovulated.  If your period is 4 or more days late,000 cycles (not all of them leading to pregnancy), 100% of the women who eventually tested positive for that cycle had done so by 4 days after their missed period.

If you got a negative pregnancy test but your period continues to be late, a negative test will turn positive within a few days of your missed period.

* **My period is very late

It’s always possible, extremely common, even in women who normally have very regular periods.  They can be caused by changes in diet, stress, exercise, travel, weight, and can also lead to failure to ovulate or to irregular

Rarely, see a doctor.

* **I missed 1 birth control pill.  What should I do?**

Your pill insert probably tells you what to do in this case.  If you’re using a combined pill (contains ethinyl estradiol)

* **I don’t take my pill at the same time every day.  Am I going to get pregnant?**

With combined pills (contain ethinyl estradiol)

* **I missed 2 birth control pills.  What should I do?**

Most pill inserts will recommend using a backup method.  This is a good idea no matter which 2 pills you missed.  But one thing the pill insert doesn’t explain is that *which* 2 pills you missed is very important in determining your risk of getting pregnant.

Since most pills have 7 days of placebo pills, so missing those 2 pills (before or after the placebo week) is extremely risky.  

Missing 2 pills at another point in your pill pack is still not advisable

* **How soon after having unprotected sex can I take a pregnancy test?**

You can try taking one 10 days after you think you ovulated

* **Can I get my period and still be pregnant?**

Yes

Background information
-----------------------------
**The menstrual cycle**
Each menstrual cycle begins with the first day of true bleeding, or endometrium, along with some blood, vaginal secretions, and cervical mucus.  This occurs for about a week, give or take a few days.

During this time, LH, and FSH levels rise and then quickly fall.

Endometrial lining continues to grow and thicken for about two weeks.  During this time, your next period starts and the cycle begins again.

Everything that happens before ovulation is part of the follicular phase, you probably ovulated **14 days before your next expected period.** The length of the follicular phase is less stable than the length of the luteal phase, so estimating ovulation based on your next period is more effective than estimating ovulation based on your last period.

**How pregnancy occurs**

Pregnancy occurs when a sperm meets a mature egg as it’s released from the ovarian follicle.  Although this window is fairly short (12 to 48 hours), slick, or egg-white textured cervical mucus provides a healthy environment for sperm to survive and swim to the egg in.  (You can learn more about cervical mucus [here](http://www.americanpregnancy.org/gettingpregnant/PECervical-mucus.html), [here](http://www.plannedparenthood.org/health-topics/birth-control/fam-cervical-mucus-method-22140.htm), or [here](http://www.cervicalmucus.net/).

If the sperm successfully reaches the egg, the former zygote, now embryo, will implant around 8 to 9 days after ovulation.  Around this time, trophoblastic cells in the embryo begin to secrete low levels of human chorionic gonadotropin, or hCG.  HCG levels rise very quickly during early pregnancy, doubling or tripling every 48 hours.

**How pregnancy is detected**

Pregnancy tests measure levels of hCG.  Urine tests that you take at home have a range of sensitivity.  The most sensitive tests can measure about 25 mIU (milli-international units) of hCG.  Some won’t turn positive until hCG levels reach 50 or 100 mIU.

A blood test at the doctor’s office can detect levels of hCG down to 1 mIU

**How pregnancy is prevented**

There are a lot of methods to prevent pregnancy.  Hormonal methods rely on chemicals that mimic your normal menstrual cycle.  All hormonal birth control methods (every pill, NuvaRing, Implanon, the Depo shot, and to a lesser extent, Mirena IUD) contain a synthetic progesterone analog called a progestin.  Progestins bind to progesterone receptors with a much higher binding affinity than a normal progesterone molecule.  

Remember how your next menstrual cycle begins when progesterone and estrogen levels fall?  The progestins in hormonal birth control make it so that your body never got the message that progesterone levels fell.  So your next cycle never begins

Most birth control pills (and some of the other hormonal birth control options) also contain a synthetic estrogen (almost always ethinyl estradiol).  This seems to suppressing the hormone cycle that ordinarily would lead to ovulation.

after i left, was close by, and she called her. i turned the location on my phone to find out exactly where i was and sent her the address. she was there in an hour, i packed up the essentials, and whn she got there she helped me knock out one of the windows. 

the babies and i are with her right now, but my cousin and aunt. i havent contacted the police because traditionally police and travellers dont get along, but i have contacted a non-traveller friend from school and he will let me stay with him. my auntie recommended a lawyer who i have an appointment with. i dont really know anything about divorce, especially divorce with violence involved, but i hope he will be able to tell me everything. i am still scared, but i feel safe now, and i know the he cant find me or our children.

thank you so much everyone

edit: thank you so much for your support. it truly means the world for me. things have been very hectic so i have been on and off. i have also read most of the comments and would like to answer some recurring questions.

many people suggested the police, but she and my cousin im with are pushing me to go to hospital and maybe police. i am starting to side with the idea of going to police just to have a paper record of all this just in case, but you have to try to understand that i spent 18 years thinking the pigs were out to get me and try to take away pavee children from their families and shut our sites down, so its hard to turn to them. its a dishonour to go to the police, and travellers are supposed to settle things between travellers.

when i got to my cousin house she took pictures of my bruises. i also have some pictures i took myself and i saved texts and voicemails of him saying abusive things to me. i also have an electronic diary where i recorded a lot of what happened, and after i meet with the lawyer and hopefully file, i will be moving in with an old school friend who agreed to let me stay with him and his sister. ive known him for many years and he has always been very understanding and caring especially considering my culture. hes a country person, and we all think its best i stay away from other travellers as much as possible.

there were also a few people who mentioned my decision to marry young and have children. i got a lot of defending, marriage is freedom, or at least thats what we think. my family is very traditional in this respect. my mother got married at 16, my sister at 18, and everyone else in my family got married young. i have a cousin who is unmarried at 20 and people are always whispering to us. marriage young is normal for us. before we got married he was always very kind and loving, bought me lots of gifts and told me the sweetest things. i truly did believe he loved me and that he was a good man. his family has a good reputation and my older brother was even friends with him and vouched for him. he changed after i got pregnant, and then got possessive, and abusive. i dont feel like anyone should tell me i was asking for it by getting married young. i didnt know any other way of life. marriage is important because of our culture and religion

In the shower last night

There are a few girls out there who automatically dislike pretty girls. This is due to subconscious insecurity and the unconscious feeling that these pretty girls are a threat to their own self worth

However

I am automatically non-threatening because I don’t fit standard beauty definitions of facial symmetry and low body fat percentage.

Which is an upside. I’m generally pretty shy

Thinking about this lead me to think about what it is to be a Fat Girl in general.

Now. Don't tell me that I'm not fat.

Dude

I am not within the average weight range for my height

I know that my friends who tell me I'm not fat do it because they care about me. They don't want me to feel poorly about myself and I appreciate that. But

Because it's not necessarily a Bad Thing.

I am healthy. I can run if I have to. I enjoy the elliptical machine if I have an audiobook. I look forward to my 45 minute walk to school every morning. I love hot yoga.

But

Maybe I don’t have enough self control.

I’ve tried diets. The low carb one worked pretty well. But I’m still trying to decide if the 10 lbs I lost were worth me coming near to tears in the grocery store because I couldn’t even find soup that didn’t have carbs. I denied myself so many simple things that made me happy.

Right now, I’m not on any diet, aside from the poor student on campus budget. Maybe I’ll try again in April. But not now.

And even so

I may be fat

My boyfriend loves my “thick thighs” and nuzzles into my slightly pillowy stomach whenever I will let him. He still thought I was sexy when I was at my heaviest.

But more importantly

I am strong. I am sturdy. I am balanced.

I am fat.

I know this. I accept this as an objective fact. It is not a slight against my character. It does not make me less than others.

It makes me who I am. Growing up in this specific body

When I say this out loud

I know exactly who and what I am

I am a Fat Girl. But that does not mean that I cannot also be a Pretty Girl.

This was originally posted on my tumblr and it was mostly ignored because no one follows me. (HIGHLY NSFW. SERIOUSLY I POST PORN SOMETIMES) http://embersinmyeyes.tumblr.com/

I love this community. Everyone is so supportive and loving and wonderful. Thank you so much to /u/DylanMcDermott who bought me some reddit gold! &lt;3 It's really cool actually! &lt;3

To the people who don't feel so great about their looks: you're beautiful. No matter what you look like

It took me a while to figure out how I could be happy. And it mostly involves mentally telling the people who put me down to go fuck themselves with a cactus.

And I want to be clear that I am all for dieting and exercising and all that wonderful weight loss stuff

My comment was simply that it did not make me happy. So much so that dieting actually brought me legitimate despair.

I don't overeat

So at this point

'Cause that's all I want. I want to be happy. And hardcore keto diets do not make me happy.   

The TwoX community makes me happy. I love the discussions here and the kindness. I don't see as much kindness in the world as I'd like to

Plus, warmth, fun and life!

1360065398.0,17xfwt,My husband just ran away from home an hour ago,sadlady,1346,336,424,"We've been married 17 years

He couldn't make up his mind to give up the idea of building a life with this girl he hardly knew and had never even seen with her clothes on. Apparently the fact that he'd already built a life with me just wasn't on his radar. Dont get me wrong, but she couldn't fit us in until next month.

Last night I told him I was starting to think about asking him to move out, then changed his mind and spent the night on the sofa instead. He told me he'd come in and say goodbye before he left for work. I woke up to the sound of him pulling out of the driveway at 4:30 in the morning. We exchanged a couple of texts. He apologized, I let him know he was welcome to come back if he needed to and told him to take care of himself. Then I cried a lot and alternated between punching his side of the bed and stroking it tenderly (so I lost my mind for a bit). When my daughter wakes up I'll have to be more sane.

So here I am, hoping for some human contact.

TLDR: He gone.

EDIT: Sorry I can't respond to each of you please know I'm reading it all.
He fainted in a public place and I got a text from him from the emergency room. I offered to come and he said he wanted me there. Turns out he was planning to leave, and we both want an experienced hand guiding our medications.

about him: He's been a great guy, supportive. I think his drive to try to be the ""perfect"" husband is a large part of the problem. I think it's very unlikely that he's doing drugs. He's even been extra careful about his alcohol consumption. He admits his problems started around the time of my last post a year and a half ago. He's apologized for not seeking treatment for his depression at the time.

about me: I don't work. I developed health problems more than a decade ago that precluded me working. I'm actually doing a lot better now

open marriage: I'm actually not opposed to the idea in principle. The problem right now is that he isn't interested in sex with me. I'm afraid if he starts having sex with young girls he'll never want to come back to my post-menopausal and two damned big babies body. If our sex life was in working order I'd definitely be open to the discussion. As it is now I'm concerned it might just be the death of our marriage altogether. Also there's the problem of his attachment to this one particular girl. It's not just sex he's fantasizing about

I am by nature a calm and rational person. All this chaos is definitely throwing some hard body blows to my self-image and sense of balance though. I'm upping the yoga and meditation components of my daily life in an attempt to bring myself back to center. Thanks again to everyone for taking the time to try and help this total stranger.

EDIT AGAIN: Sorry forgot to explain about the girl. The last time he went to the club it was specifically to see her. They exchanged phone numbers. She texted him she didn't want to see him at the club anymore,,False,,t5_2r2jt,1360108671.0,,True

&gt;That’s it. That’s all she said. Well, “No, she needs some me time to learn about herself.”** That was the extent of the Taylor Swift mock-a-thon.

In her latest Vanity Fair interview

&gt;In an profile in this month’s Vanity Fair, and using a quote Katie Couric gave her, said, **“There’s a special place in hell reserved for women who don’t help other women.”**

I think it's pretty obvious that if you make a public career by singing about your relationships, but public figures *are* open for light hearted jokes. It comes with the territory - and the millions of dollars that they get from having a PUBLIC persona.

What I would have liked to do was call 911 and verify that there were, in fact, police officers standing outside my door, but every 10 seconds or so, they'd knock loudly again and yell at me that ""[they were] not going away,"" and that someone had called them about an incident in my apartment.

The high urgency of the knocking and yelling stressed me out, so I let them in. They really were police officers and they were investigating a fight in my building that someone had mistakenly identified as coming from my unit.

So some questions: (1) Am I completely nuts for not wanting to let them in? (2) What do I do next time? (3) How do I get them to chill out while I call a dispatcher and make sure they are who they say they are? Because it really doesn't seem right to open my door to every stranger who tells me to at 2am

But posting a picture of a fetus at what appears to be maybe 3 months is disturbing

I sat out of class the day they showed fetuses on jars in health class because I do not want to see that.

Unless you have ever been in the position to have to make such a difficult choice

I don't see many pro-choicers posting pictures saying ""Have an abortion!"" ... I see them saying, horrifying or terrible and you should be allowed to make a choice as to what you are going to do with your body. 

Unless you've been raped you will NEVER understand the psychologically and physical effects of that trauma. Never.
You can't even pretend to understand what someone goes through on a daily basis.
You will never know what it is like to sleep with the lights on because sleeping in the dark gives you panic attacks or nightmares.
Or what it's like to sleep in running shoes.
Or how it feels to keep a knife under your pillow because it's the only way you feel safe enough to sleep.

How about you post or like a picture that says ""Stop rape""? Or is that a little too uncomfortable for you to think about?

Let’s do the back-story first. All of my life, my older sister got the brunt of it. After he kicked my older sister out, he then directed it towards me. For years. I spent years living with him. He spent years tearing me down. I am not going to get into details, suffice to say that when I finally was able to move in with my mum at the age of 16, I was pretty messed up. I didn’t end my relationship with him until I was 19. I did so by moving across the country. I cut him out of my life. It was glorious. For 5 years now, I’ve been living a very peaceful life with great friends, a wonderful life

Yesterday, but to a lesser extent. The conversation left me feeling boggled, upset, and fuzzy for about 24 hours. That’s when I decided that I had had enough of this. I called him back today and I told him that if he is so intent on cultivating a relationship with me that there are rules he needs to follow. I then laid out my rules. They were pertaining to certain behaviors that he has/had. I essentially told him that he had better smarten the fuck up, because a relationship with me was earned, not deserved. Then I told him to think about it, come to a decision

It was the best moment of my adult life. 

Note: Please don’t blame my mother for leaving me with my father. She was a single mother, there were 6 of us living in a 2-bedroom house. She did the best she could at the time with the resources she had. I love her so much and am so grateful to have her in my life. 

Thanks for reading. I just really needed to get this all out.


Edit: I am absolutely floored with the support that this community has given me. I can’t even begin to tell you all what your words of encouragement mean to me. Thank you so much. 

I am also saddened by how many of you have to suffer through abusive relationships as well. When the time is right

One of the lingering ""symptoms"" of emotional abuse victimhood (or survivorhood) is the fear of expressing oneself for fear of retribution. As a result, or step forward, metaphorically speaking. In my case, my SO was someone with a serious anger problem, who frequently took it out on doors, walls, and other inanimate objects. His trigger could be virtually anything

It's only been a month, in a way, I'm listening to him give me his house rules all over again. God forbid we step out of line, lest our post be vaporized without appeal. It feels like intimidation, and bullying.

The fact is, it says that we have no power, and that it's not really ""our"" community. It's theirs, and we're just here until they decide we're no longer contributing.

I know this got a little rant-y. I'm not going to apologize for that. I just hope I'm not the only one who feels this way.

Two years ago I found joy in being an inspiring role model to other girls, I used public transit and I walked as much as I could.  Two years ago I loved the freedom I had to be able to spontaneously meet a friend on another side of the city and I could find my way there without fear.  Two years ago I was a cheerful and optimistic girl who smiled at strangers when I passed them in the street.  Two years ago I spent a summer day and evening with my family and friends

Two years ago I was raped
My faith in others was destroyed, because I never thought that I could become a person so full of fear and hatred.  The feelings of violation and mistrust were also forced into my sisters lives and that breaks my heart.  I have always tried to teach those girls to embrace life and to live with an independence and strength that comes from within, no matter how scary the world seems.  Now, they live so afraid that this will happen to them, and I fear that their lives have been stunted by one person who chose to commit a hateful and disgusting act of violence against me.  

I spent night after night, and was immediately filled with nausea remembering those moments of utter terror.  No one should ever have to beg for their life the way I did, and to be made to do every horrible thing that I was told to do, so that I wouldn’t die.  

The only way that I can make those memories stop, but I didn't bury it.  I picked it up all battered and bruised and instead of hiding it away, I raised it up in my hands for all to witness.  I said “SEE THIS?  Do you see this ugly thing, all tattered and bloody?  It was mine, and what was once so effervescent and full of life is damaged and it’s hurting… it’s dying.  What do I do with it now?”
And they answered, with voices loud and full of promise they said “we see it, we cherish it and we will hold it for you until you're ready”.

Today.  
I am ready.
She’s back
Today I took my soul back and it’s saturated with the force of a hundred hearts and minds that stand with me.  With this strength I'll finally sleep soundly and undisturbed all night.  I will travel free on my way without fear of what or who could be lurking around a corner or a bush or a tree.  I won't jump at sounds or footsteps behind me
  
My intuition is renewed
I exist in this moment; grounded and full of courage. 
 
Two years ago I was raped.
And today; I am a survivor.

I live at college (I'm a 20 year old Indian girl) and over the summer I come home. Recently, really disturbing and I keep trying to avoid it, but when I talk to him, I catch him staring at my chest obviously and then quickly looking up to meet my eyes.

I'm not the kind of girl to wear tank tops all the time


I came home last night after going out for dinner with a few friends and I was wearing kind of a low cut dress. He got mad at me (when I came home) and told me to stand in front of him so he could see what I was wearing. I felt incredibly uneasy and sat right back down. The rest of the night I caught him staring at my chest every so often.

It took a lot of courage to tell my mom about this and she just completely dismissed me, friends.

**edit:** I decided that I needed to take action. This morning I was making breakfast and my little brother told me that my dad was blatantly staring at my ass for a long twenty minutes (he was in the dining room and I was in the kitchen, pack a few things, and live for the rest of the summer on campus with my best friend.

[rant]",copper_rainbows,1324,362,http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/1aql1b/after_months_of_trying_to_figure_out_why_my_bf/

Some backstory: I've (I'm 27) been dating this guy (he is 35) since August, sex was frequent and vigorous. I overlooked his unwillingness to go down as something he didn't wanna do until we dated awhile. I get that. (All the while I was asked to and happily gave lots of bj's, of course.) The more our relationship has progressed, the less sex we've had. Normally I could attribute this to our long work hours (he is a chef) and a bit of slowing down of the sex drive as the newness of a relationship wears off. But now, it's gotten to where we've had sex once in three weeks. I have been and always will be a horndog. I could have sex 5 or 6 times a week, if given my choice. So with a dry spell like this...I am terribly unsatisfied. I'm questioning everything, am I not pretty enough anymore? Is he unattracted to me? What could I do to fix this? Why am I not good enough? Have I gotten too fat? Should I start a starvation diet?

I have tried talking to him about these things, holding my hand, touching me at all. I get it that everyone has different levels of affection they feel comfortable with, and even though all my previous relationships have included a lot more physical expressions of affection, I'm willing to bend and compromise, you know? But I feel like I'm in a desert, starving to death, babe

When we do have sex, and was incredulous when I told him otherwise. And to you sisters out there who can, bless you for the gods have smiled kindly upon you. But for poor saps like me, I've gotta have some...clitoral stimulation...for me to ""get there"". He doesn't wanna touch me to make me cum, and he doesn't really even try to kiss me, caress me, etc when I try to get myself there. This lack of interest makes me feel totally unsexy and insecure, he doesn't give a shit it seems like and my body just can't let go. 

Regarding oral, to no real effect. This kills me. Every and I mean EVERY other relationship I've had my partner has been willing and (gasp!) eager to do this for me. Not only because they like it but because they knew that doing so would not only get me all primed and ready physically, but because I would be really turned on and ready to then rock their world. But not this guy. I've tried to make him understand I can't cum without some kind of stimulation beyond just fucking...to no avail. And I'm starting to get rather bitter.

So: last night after a few beers I finally dragged it out of him. I asked ""Babe, eating pussy makes you a bitch. And I'm not a bitch, I just won't do it"".

Shock. And. Awe. What the fuck kind of twisted pathetic concept of masculinity is THAT?! Oh really

Then he says ""plus, I'm not opposed to some playful things like that in the bedroom, but after his initial statement, that just reinforced that I am not good enough the way I am. The vagina is gross, a thing to be feared, a dirty thing that causes men to become ""bitches"" if they kiss it. It's just so far beyond the pale, that pathetic reasoning.

Don't get me wrong, I feel ugly, lame, gross, unsexy, unwanted, and unworthy. I feel crazy for putting up with this. I really like this guy, and I don't really want to lose him. But how the fuck can I stand to be in a relationship where my femininity and needs as a woman and as a person are not only neglected

What the hell do I do about this

Rapists are rapists for a reason. They're not good, you can't say 'excuse me, I have a right to be in this laundry room alone at night, and you don't have the right to rape me' and expect them to say ""oh that's right, I'm sorry"" and leave you alone. 

I hope and pray for a world where women can freely walk down the streets at any hour of the night

Telling a woman not to walk alone at night is not victim blaming. It's rapist blaming. I don't say to my friends ""try not to walk alone at night unless you have to

I know being raped wasn't my fault. But I also acknowledge that there were many things that I could've done to protect myself from an evil person

On like my third date with this guy, none of his friends could go camping with him, but he really wanted to go. I offered to go with him because I love camping.


Camping was our fourth date. I went over to his house the night before, I gave him a rocking BJ (NSFW sorry but that's the only horn I can toot during this story, lol). 

We wake up. I go to put my contact in and realize the hydrogen peroxide solution has not neutralized yet and started screaming in pain in his bathroom. I honestly could not stop wailing it hurt so badly. He was kind of shocked by the noises coming from the bathroom

BUT...I will hold my head up high because I'm on vacation damn it. And I'm going to have fun.


That night we had a camp fire, woke up the next morning cuddling. My eye is still kinda red, but it's fading and I'm thinking ""perfect...the last 24hrs of this camping trip I'll be sun tan, my eye will look normal, I'll be able to wear contacts and put makeup on and leave him looking like the bomb shell that I am.""

So we're drinking our morning bloody Marys... have a couple beers as we sit in the sun, and we go to the family party. I say hi and everyone's really excited to meet me. I sat in the sun with his sister and his mother. I think it was at this point that I forgot that I had been drinking with him all morning.


This is a dry party by the way, so I follow her. She makes me a drink with some kind of pop and liquor--I usually don't drink liquor because nothing good ever happens but, hey, what the hell, I'm on vacation damn it! 

We're all talking in the circle

....that right there is maybe the last thing I remember thinking until waking up the next morning.

I didn't think about what I didn't remember the next morning because I woke up feeling refreshed and frisky and excited that I was still on vacation! He wasn't as frisky as I was, got dressed, and just started making breakfast silently.

I wake up, and realize my purse is nowhere.

As I'm trying to remember where my purse is, and (2) I do not remember the ride home last night. 

While making phone calls to his family in hopes to find my purse, there was a dog there?"". The third time I let the dog out, it got into a fight with a cat, and according to him, that was our queue to leave. (I have confirmed that both the dog and the cat were not injured. I may have blacked out at a dry party for a family I have not met, but I do have a heart.)

I got into a fight with his cousin Dave (I have no idea what Dave looks like by the way--don't remember meeting him. I don't remember meeting half of the family actually. I remember no names. I barely remember what his father looked like). Apparently Dave started talking about how women in the Upper Penninsula are ugly

His mother asked if I wanted another drink and apparently I laughed in her face as I declined thinking it was a funny question. I imagine I looked kind of like [this](http://i.imgur.com/gkTWd0n.png). 

I learned all of this in the five hours we had to drive home. It was so overwhelming that I started losing the ability to keep my responses polite. For instance

Me: ""Shit

Him: ""You don't remember that either do you""

Me: ""Fuck...sorry""

Him: ""................""

Me: ""Was it good sex?""

Him: ""Not really...it was just drunk sex.""

Me: ""Damn it well can I get a play by play? What positions did we do it in?""


Yeah

What I learned about myself is even if I'm black out drunk

**TLDR: Got black out drunk at a dry high school graduation party while meeting this cute dude's family for the first time, lost my purse, all whilst looking like Quasimodo with a big fat red eye.**

And that's how you lose a guy during a 48hr camping excursion.

*EDIT: To provide context, um... yeah, why would you not think I have issues with the sliver of my life I have represented here? I never knew I had that kind of ugly in me but, it came out and now I know what I'm capable of. And I never wish to see it again. lol. It's one awful awful night that I never want to re-live. Ever. Unless someone needs a good laugh, in which case, I have a story for you.*",,,,

I run a locksmith shop alone

Just now a woman came in and said ""I don't think you're strong enough, tear drop peice of metal made to be almost impossible to bend. You know when something appears to be made out of standard wire, and then you go to bend it and it is impossible? Like, it might as well be made out of hard plastic? That was what this was made of, and it didn't care what gender was opening it, it was not giving in.

Okay, I can do this. Nope, no tools could bend this fucker. It was made to withhold resistance, even if I were to pry it open, It would snap right back. The only way to do it was with my hands. She started to say ""yeah its okay I'll go somewh...."" when I played the words ""I don't think you're strong enough"" back in my head. 

Then I played them again. And again. And again. My thumb dug into the opening of the wire, all the while being constantly held in place by each set of stinging thumbs and pointer fingers. ""I don't think you're strong enough, I don't think you're strong enough, I don't think you're.."" SNAP. 
The key slid in. 

Ladies, I know I don't, I'm wearing a god damn floral dress, but some women that come in have this tone. This almost disapproving, doubtful, confused tone in their voice when they ask me a question. They have even asked if there is a man ""that works here"" that can cut their keys for them. We are talking about a shop the size of a small kitchen. There isn't even a bathroom in here.

The post implies that a woman needs a man to support her and only the woman should have a good past.

Why can't a woman have a good future too?

Why shouldn't the man have a good past? Why is it necessary for a woman to be an angel while it's okay for the man to have any kind of past he desires.

well last night i dressed really cute, even if it just meant talking to someone new. i went to a party with a lot of people i knew but also a lot i didn't so i was feeling pretty good about the situation. if my plan failed, i could always hang out with my friends. i ended up noticing this really cute guy who was talking with some friends of mine. i walked over and we eventually got to talking; he just moved to the city and we had a long conversation about all the cool things to do in philly. i felt pretty good about myself, usually talking to someone so cute would be slightly intimidating to me but the conversation flowed easily and he was really nice.

later, and watch movies. after another beer and a hit of a blunt i worked up the courage to ask him to come smoke a cigarette with me. as we were smoking, i turned to him and said ""i hope this isn't too forward, but i think you're really cute."" he said, ""it's not... i think that you're really cute too."" so i smiled (still can't believe i did this!) and said ""is it too forward to admit that i want to kiss you?"" he stepped closer to me and said ""i want to kiss you too"". we kissed, and it was great. he was a really good kisser and i left shortly after with a smile on my face. 

the old me would have never had the balls to do that. i used to be so insecure and unsure of myself. in a way, because it turned out better than i could have ever imagined. 

he just texted me

TL;DR: a formerly shy girl decided to be more confident, and had an amazing night. confidence is power, as cheesy as that sounds.

My wife and I have always said that we would never abort

It's honestly the worst thing for us that has ever happened. Doctors never gave a warning of anything wrong and now here we are in the second trimester. 

To give insight on how severe this is

This is my personal story and I share because if it was illegal for my family to even think this

People hate on abortions but for my family this was a child that we wanted.  We have a name picked out and the room is all done up.  Our  older son even talks to my wife's belly. 

I have always been pro-choice

Edit: we had our amnio done and have set a date for an abortion.  Absolutely the hardest decision in our lives.

**-""Monthiversaries""-** When a couple celebrates their ""monthly anniversary of their relationship beginning"" IE: ""ZOMG Today is Tyler and My 7 month anniversary! We've been together, I point her [here](http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/anniversary?s=t).

**-Freaking out over small things he says/does**- Most times

**-""He still has feelings for his ex. Therefore, my silly little mind said ""even though you're totally OK with the fact that you like 4083929247403 different people at once, IT IS NOT OK FOR HIM TO LIKE ANYONE ELSE BECAUSE SCIENCE!"" Especially if your relationship is new, it's OK to have feelings for other people. If it makes you uncomfortable, just talk to them about it.

**-""He's out of my league!"" or ""Oh no. He's way too attractive for me""**  NO! JUST NO! After YEARS of insecurity for not looking like a perfect, I have realized something that could have saved me tons of trouble in my past: **confidence is key**. Once I got to a point in my life where I was truly happy with myself, (Yes, there are times that I dislike certain parts of myself, but for the most part, I'm really glad with who I am) there seemed to be no limits. ""Out of my league"" does not exist to me anymore. Rather, ""Not compatible with my personality and interests"" is more relevant. I think this boils down mostly to accepting and loving yourself, STOP PUTTING LIMITS ON YOURSELF. Who cares if he's out of your league? Doesn't hurt to TRY?! If he says no or doesn't flirt back

-**""I'm going to learn how to do XYZ because so-and-so will like me much more if I do!""** Guilty as charged. Even now. In fact, not because I thought it would make him like me more. Never again will I waste countless hours learning about Manchester United or watching ""The Green Lantern"" 5 times in one night because it is your man's favorite thing. No. Those things are nice, and if I do happen to become interested in those things through knowing you, then GREAT! But no more trying to force myself to like things for other people, especially men!!!! Yes, it may work out where he may find you wildly attractive because you know something about his favorite sports team. But in the end, you're doing yourself a huge disservice by not sharing YOUR interests with him

-**Petty JEALOUSY!!!**- Ok, it's natural to feel jealousy because we all want to be liked and loved and the center of attention and it hurts when that attention is directed elsewhere. But perspective is also a really beautiful thing. Him being flirty with the waitress is NOT THAT BIG OF A DEAL! And if it really bothers you that much, casually say something (I don't mean nag him about why that slutty ho was getting more attention that you)! Also, it won't kill you to turn to him and say ""I get jealous when you talk to other girls like that because I really enjoy attention from you."" That (at least to me) doesn't sound like I'm psychotic, but also gets the point across.

-**""I'm FINE""**- Ok ladies, lots of reasons. Most times, I said this because I didn't want to talk about it anymore or I didn't want the other person to see how hurt I was or I was just so damn mad that I couldn't muster out anything else to the other person. But men don't do well with code-speak (I don't blame them, I don't either). So, it's much more beneficial to just say ""I'm upset. We can talk about it later when I've calmed down."" This, to me, seems like the logical response, so just simply telling him the truth or telling him that you don't wish to talk about it will make things a lot easier. 

On the same lines...

**-Saying the opposite of what you really mean**- I don't know how or why this happens. Sometimes, but for fixing a LOT of problems in the world.....). Also, never again will I utter the phrase *""I'm fat*"" just to hear someone deny. This is just mind torture. Why not just say, ""Hey. I'm feeling a little self-conscious today and would like some affirmation of my physical attractiveness."" (PS- I've said that exact phrase before and not only was my man shocked that I was logically saying EXACTLY what I felt and WANTED, but I got some very nice sexytime out of it :) )

**-Getting mad about really small, whine to your girlfriends about it, and GET OVER IT. No need to hold resentment for months because he left the toilet seat up. Again. Things work out much better when you calmly explain ""It really bothers me when you do this or that you did this because XYZ"" I always find that with ANYTHING, you should have REASONS. It bothers me so much when my girl friends complain to me about various things their boyfriends do to upset them, but when I ask them WHY it bothers them, they have no idea

And finally

**-The Brain-versation**- That akward back-and-forth debate between you and yourself over
Me: ""I think I'll invite so-and-so over to my parents' house for dinner""
Brain: ""Yeah
Me: ""Brain
Brain: ""Oh
*sigh* Sometimes, and fantasize it into this HORRIBLE thing. It's really not. Most guys won't automatically jump to ""CREEPER"" if you invite them over for dinner. (Some might, but hey). In fact, I don't know of any college kid that would deny some good home cooking once in awhile. Too often than not, I have refrained from telling someone the truth about how I truly feel because my brain was painting scenarios of what that person would think/do/say. STOP THIS! Condition your brain to think of what YOU would do/how YOU would feel after saying this. Yeah, you should be mindful of other people's feelings, etc. but so help me God I will never refrain from saying ""Stop. Too Deep"" because I'm afraid it might kill the mood. Sometimes, I mean

Whew. So

I can't tell why exactly but it makes me feel uncomfortable to see parents or just the internet in general over-reacting over little girls liking science or animals 

Isn't it a bit conter-productive to make little girls who like traditional ''girl'' stuff inferior for actually liking it? Isn't it a bit trophy-for-breathing-today like to cheer on a little girl who likes insect?

why are we feeling like prefering blue over pink something SO gender-roles defying and SO intelligent when I'm pretty sure the kid itself doesn't give a fuck and doesn't see anything daring in picking a t-shirt.

Aren't we RE_ENFORCING gender roles and stereotype when we freaking point the line and notice EVERYTIME a kid ''crosses'' it. Doesn't telling a little girl she's cool for liking boy stuff still passes on the concept of boy thing ~girl thing ?

Sorry if this is the wrong place to post this HERE GOES... again... 

After miscarrying triplets several months back, I made an appointment with a midwife, to find they were backed up for two months D: We took the closest one they had, March 19th. That day we would be finding out all about our baby. For insurance purposes we went in and got the blood test from our PCP, blood levels suggesting that we were 15-22 weeks along. Super surprise there, 5 1/2 months, no way! Well our friends stocked us up on all the baby things, and one night the cramping starts.

In the morning we have some delicious sex, and go to clean up- he's covered in blood, oh shit! Decide bleeding just happens sometimes, surely I couldn't be miscarrying at 5 1/2 months! So I go to work, and he's off to school. We decide if there's still bleeding after I get out of work, I will go to the e-room and get checked out.

After a beautifully sunny day, keeping things as chill as possible in the home-front. I knew it though, that something was wrong, I just knew in my gut and I prepared myself for another miscarry. I hoped this time it wouldn't end with me nearly loosing my life, saved by a D&amp;C, and emergency blood transfusion... but at 5 1/2 months along? This was going to be messy and painful, keep me here doc

After blood tests show that I should be ready to pop, but there was no heartbeat, and no baby, just a lump of some hemorrhaging tissue and fluid. It was shortly after decided I was experiencing a Molar Pregnancy. I'd never heard of this before, but they tell me I need an emergency D&amp;C, they don't even want to wait a whole day, but they need to find a doctor, I'm scheduled for the very next morning- this morning.

Everything came out ok, but I hear her crying at night. I go to snuggle and she pretends like she's been sleeping. Only 7 and already trying to act so damn grown-up. My sweetheart is unreadable, stony faced, hard to hug. I don't know if it's from the loss, or the fact that this thing might be cancer and he doesn't know how to deal. I have friends over to help with dinner, let us snuggle their babies, distract from the pain. All is well

The next year my hormone levels will be monitored once a week. If it doesn't 0 out in six months, and other organs for signs of this cancerous shit. I am 27, wtf. This entire last year has been so up and down. I'm glad for my friends and my poly lifestyle, I wouldn't have survived through this with out all the support. I got the guts to leave an abusive man, divorced, lost the house, and car, my daughter's things- but gained freedom. We were homeless, horribly sick, miscarried

Don't care if made sense, lol. Thanks for sticking with me if you did.

Edit to link to Molar Pregnancy Description


EDIT: UPDATE 12:20pm (March 6th)

Started bleeding and cramping heavily again just now, as I was instructed to do over the next 48 hours, and it's at 101.1. I called immediately as I was instructed to do if my temp went up. I'm currently waiting for a ride to the emergency room. Apparently this isn't good, really... really? I can't just go home and sleep it off? I think I would be freaking out a lot more, if all you wonderful people hadn't been here for me all morning. I'm taking you guys with me to the e-room I'll have you know. I guess we'll see what happens guys :(

EDIT: UPDATE 4:48pm

Well, just pain for no good reason! They gave me something to relax me after having been up all night with cramping and sharp pains in the ol' vag and uterus. So, whew. Looks like I'll be able to go home and relaxe :) hopefully I'll get some good sleep tonight. THANKS AGAIN GUYS &lt;3 All the hugs are so appreciated!

EDIT: UPDATE 8:32 pm

Just got home from the ER. They've upped my pain meds, even since yesterday. I was dehydrated, and really low on potassium (that's crazy because I eat my vitamins, and eat mostly fresh fruits, and fresh cooked veggies and stuff everyday!) I was instructed to be on bedrest for the next two days, to take it light on day three, and to start getting up and around on day four- day five I can return to work! I can't wait to call my boss tomorrow, OH, etc. Awwww schucks, just let it go... but sometimes that's harder than it seems. Especially when something like chemo sounds so painful. Guess I will have to start quilting or something

Edit: April 19th

Looks like things are going well, and my sweetie and are going to be waiting until we're in a better place me physically and both of us financially, before trying again. Thank you all for being here with me when I felt so desperate and lonely, when I felt like nothing in the world would ever be ok again &lt;3 A million hugs &lt;3",,False,,1366388140.0,t3_19rpku

If you don't feel like reading these links the long and short of it is that I was passed over for a job specifically because my interviewer thought I needed more make up. I called the owner and he's still doing everything he can to fix the situation so it's fair for everyone involved. He is also a very awesome dude. I was promised a verbal and a written apology when my interviewer was ready to give a sincere one.

I got the call on Monday
Without further ado

""Hello Miss InKitchen

""If you're looking for an apology for all the extra hassle I'm afraid you've called the wrong number.""

""No, after sitting through hours of retraining I realized that I was the one with the narrow mind and the one with the problem. I was judging people based on superficial ideals, both at and outside of work. I was being rude, unprofessional, and shallow. After going through all this hassle and dreading having to call you, the person who set it all in motion, I realized you helped me start to become a better employee and hopefully a better person. Now I don't have to apologize to you

I thanked her for the apology and congratulated her on her self realizations and continued employment. Then we hung up. I really hope everything she said was true, maybe the actions will follow.


Thanks for all the support TwoX!",,t5_2r2jt,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/1ck8oz/this_better_be_an_april_fools_prank_apology_update/
