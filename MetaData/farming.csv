I had read some papers by Dr. John Ikerd at Univ. of ~~Illinois~~ Missouri that sort of gave me some hope that we could actually turn a little profit from our venture. He wrote a [series of papers on small farms](http://web.missouri.edu/ikerdj/papers/default.htm#Small Farms) and encouraged small farmers to find niche markets. I can't find the exact quote, etc.). While I don't know how true that may be, it IS a bit of an inspiration. I'd love for my fiancee to quit her day job so she can do this full time, and those papers give me a bit of hope!

Here's some of what we do sort of outside of what we thought was ""normal"" (such as processing poultry and raising the sheep) -- I'd love to hear what you might be doing!

* Ground
* Breeding silkies
* Herbs for local distillery (planning for next year)
* Hops for local homebrewers (planning for next year)
* Blown eggs for crafts (Ukrainian wax dyeing
* Feathers for crafts (still working on this)
* Rabbit pelts for crafts (still learning to tan hides ...)

The pet food has been a winner for us. We sell it for just as much as we would for people food and I sell out as soon as I let people know I have it in stock.

We also sought out some ethnic markets for our regular products -- I have a fellow from Vietnam who buys every duck egg I have in stock. Apparently they're hard to come by! There seems to be some interest from them in buying live meat birds

We do this all on 10 acres while still keeping our day jobs. It's a lot of work

and i started thinking about how google would actually view farming. the matrix of hunger

imagine 20-50 small/tiny horticultural plots distributed across a town (or the google campus) ranging in size from a half acre down to a single plant or tree. each geotagged with data on what's what, a record of fertilization and weeding. 

make a mobile app that tells you what food is growing around you, what food near you needs harvesting or weeding, gamify it obviously, leader boards for most food planted, most propogation, bonuses for importing new species and propogating successful plants, starting new plots, most food given away...

make a distributed flagging/advertising system for help-needed requests

the app design is a massive, also community gardens, but starting a couple-few dozen tiny 5x5 plots in public parks would be the perfect way to get the ball rolling. 

your standard row-crop agricultural model would perform poorly for this. what this would reward is distributed horticultural plants

You see

I suspect that it might be pork and chicken indoor confinement production that consume the bulk

**TL;DR:** Does anybody have data as to what specific animals consume antibiotics and for what purpose?


**EDIT:** I found a KSU study titled ""Use Estimates of In-Feed Antimicrobials in Swine Production in the United States"" which found that 1.6 million pounds of antibiotics are used in pork production annually for growth promotion/nutritional efficiency.  Add in antibiotics used for disease treatment

However

Further breakdown from the same UCS study: 11 million pounds of that are used in poultry feed
10 million pounds in hog feed and 4 million pounds in cattle feed.

**EDIT 2:** I personally don't consider the Union of Concerned Scientists a credible source.  I suspect their breakdown of ""non-therapeutic use"" is inflated.  [24.6 million pound for exclusively growth use in 2001 vs the FDA figure in 2010 indicating *total* use

**EDIT 3:** Official statement from the National Cattlemen: ""In the mid-1980s

Here's a 1999 feedlot survey: 
http://www.aphis.usda.gov/animal_health/nahms/feedlot/downloads/feedlot99/Feedlot99_dr_PartIII.pdf

Here's a 2006 swine survey: 
http://www.aphis.usda.gov/animal_health/nahms/swine/downloads/swine2006/Swine2006_dr_PartIII.pdf

There's a lot of detail there
Cattle operations on the other hand are are a lot more complicated. It seems like almost all feedlots feed new arrivals with some form of tetracycline, the number is only 0.1%. 42.3% of cattle do get fed Tylosin though and the number is much higher at feedlots with &gt; 8000 head (47.2%) than it is with smaller feedlots (16.1%). This is most likely because coccidiosis is more of a problem in larger feedlots.

**Overview**- Here, cotton, mustard, Kinnow(a breed of Orange) and Guar.
not everything is done using machines

* being poor farmer means you have 1-10 Acres.

* being average farmer means you have 10-15 Acres.

* being above average farmer means you have 15-30 Acres.

* being rich farmer means you have 30~ Acres.

that's why most of the foreign companies modify their tractors according to our need.
Fuel price is 45 Rupees per litre[1 US $=52 Rupees]


**Machines used**

* Tractor ranging from 40-60HP. i have FORD 3600[they are still available here]. [image](http://mw2.google.com/mw-panoramio/photos/medium/49877176.jpg)

* other farm equipment

* WE DON'T USE BULL CARTS AND BULLS


**PROBLEMS**
here are some problems faced by Farmers in Punjab[India]

* OIL PRICES- Govt gives subsidy on diesel but recently govt is thinking to cut it so oil prices are going high.

* SOCIAL PERCEPTION- Normally farmers are seen as Idiots, fuel price and labor.

* CORRUPTION- It is a national problem for Developing India but it affects farmers mainly. bureaucratic corruption prevails in schemes made by govt for farmers. for eg- Govt gives subsidy on fertilizers. Fertilizers are made by govt owned companies run by bureaucrats

* CROP PRICES- here

For us we could use a rain but everything is still in good shape.  It feels odd to say we need a rain since it was so wet all spring but we've been baking for a couple weeks now.  The corn is tasseling and tall.  Too tall really as fears of a weak root system with all the wet weather and summer storms could result in down corn by harvest.  

Soybeans are looking great.  We just about have all our spraying done.

The thing with this

In the event that we were able to secure financing for 100+ acres plus some equipment

Is starting a new farm even a thing any more? Or do you kinda have to get in on an operation that is already established in the marketplace? 

tldr: Is there a way to finance a new farm that allows the farm to mature? 

edit: Really interesting dialogue going here. Thanks so much for all the replies. Upvotes all around. More about us, chickens. Yes our credit is 800+ each. I've got 15 years cross-industry business and financial management experience. She's got 7 + years of self-employment and has owned livestock of one kind or another all her life. We've explored Grade A dairy certification for where we're at, but don't see us growing beyond 8 milk goats here and infrastructure costs are too high to justify for that few. I love love love the idea of starting small and growing into it but if at least one of us is tied to a full-time in-city jobbie-job, we aren't going to be able to get enough land with our everyday cashflow (I'm talking even just 10 acres) where a commute is realistic. So how does one start small? If we could make a real run of it with the 2 acres we have, that'd be great, but I don't think that will cut it. Would love to hear that I am wrong though. ",,self,,

Myself and every rancher that I know, heifers, and cows averaged out).  Corn constitutes only around 12% of the average cows diet.

Most people have been taught that the diet of a beef cow is 100% corn.  I need sources that show what this is not true.

**Update:** if you look at /u/camdemonium's 'cattle on feed' report

Now if you look at the total US beef herd numbers we are at 29.3 million as of 1/1/2013.  [Report here.](http://usda01.library.cornell.edu/usda/current/Catt/Catt-02-01-2013.pdf)

There have been at least two cases where my dad has farmed on halves with older guys for 15-20 years and then shaken their hand to buy the land planning on going to the bank the next day only to have one of the super farmers in our area buy the land out from underneath him. Do big farmers try to keep smaller farmers from buying land where you live as well?

I have an interview for an animal care assistant job on a farm (http://www.springbarnfarm.com/ for anyone who wants more information on the type of farm it is). 
I'm very nervous. The job description asked for 2 years minimum in the industry. I wrote that I dont have this
On the phone, this is more or less what I want to do for a career. It'll sting if I mess it up and dont give it my best. Noone around me is in this field really, so advice is sparse on the ground.

Can anyone give me any general pointers or techniques?  What sort of traits would such an establishment be looking for? Any advice? What would make you hire someone for such a role?

1369775780.0,1f83fb,The folly of organic and GMO food labeling and a suggestion for something better. x-post from /r/organic,Mach10X,18,6,49,"I wrote this up a while ago and wanted your opinions.  I know many of you may be in the crowd of 100% organic and 100% non-GMO or nothing.  However hear me out and help he understand if I've made any mistakes in my logic and research.

I wanted to speak a little about the labeling of organic foods and the proposed regulations to label GMO crops. I think this is a very dangerous game and I'll explain. In a nutshell both GMO and organic can be both good and bad. The true holy grail relies in using the best parts of both organic farming and non-organic farming practices

Regarding organic, namely the good synthetic pesticides that are highly targeted and designed to breakdown into harmless substances.  Many synthetic pesticides and repellents in their unbroken down form are harmless even in concentrations hundreds or thousands of times what you could possibly get from eating treated foods that have been unwashed (same is true of the best organic pesticides as well).  Farmers should be enticed to use the last harmful pesticides not just whatever will get them the organic sticker.

Current laws and regulations on organic food labeling are not helping us at all

Regarding GMO labeling. We should not be enticing farmers to completely cut out GMO, Roundup ready GMO can be great as long as the farmers are using round up sparingly and the modification has been proven to not alter the nutrition of the plant or cause the plant to produce any harmful byproducts in the transcription of these modified genes.  Responsible farmers would use roundup ready seed as well as other methods of weed control (great examples in organic non chemical weed control methods). A combination of both is ideal. Irresponsible farmers looking at nothing but profits will use far too much round up and end up fueling the evolution of herbicide resistant plants while flooding the environment with excess toxic chemicals via runoff.  GMOs that reduce the time for germination and increase growth rate, as long is it's carefully tested and openly peer reviewed to show that no harmful proteins are expressed by the gene insertion process are a not just good but necessary to feed our growing populations.

The solution? We need some sort of non-profit or neutral agency that can certify responsible farming practices and techniques. I'd like to know that the food I'm buying was farmed only with chemicals and fertilizers that pass the Ames test ([info on this and how it pertains to farming](http://tierneylab.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/06/06/synthetic-v-natural-pesticides/)).  I'd love to buy meat, non-organic, GMO and non-GMO have to offer.  This voluntary participation group would ban certain harmful practices and provide an approved list of safe to use chemicals that have been scientifically proven to be effective and the least toxic.  Farmers would be audited for amounts of chemicals use in a fair manner and agree to apply non-chemical techniques and pest control solutions in tandem with responsible use of chemical pesticides and repellents.  

Sadly simple labeling Non-GMO and Organic foods alone does not mean this at all and are very misleading to consumers.",self,t5_2qrz8,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/farming/comments/1f83fb/the_folly_of_organic_and_gmo_food_labeling_and_a/

Food demand is going to increase.  This is going to increase the consumption of non-renewable energy that modern agriculture depends on

There is a great alternative to the course we are on.  We can use our resources to transition to sustainable systems of food production.

**What agricultural practices should we work to reduce and cease?:**

- The use of non-renewable energy.

- The use of chemicals that have negative [human](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_effects_of_pesticides) and [environmental](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental_effects_of_pesticides) effects.

- [Slash and burn techniques](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slash_and_burn) - used by between 200 and 500 million people worldwide.  

**What practices should we adopt and develop?:**

- Water Conservation

- No-Till

- Recycling of local nutrients through composting

**Resources:**

[National Sustainable Farming Information Service](http://attra.ncat.org/)

[Sustainable Agriculture Research and Education](http://www.sare.org/)

**Things to think about:**

How do we convince farmers to transition to sustainable practices?  You would have to show it to be profitable and simplified through technology or community support.

How do we inspire more people to become farmers and simplify getting into the field?  Design small scale systems of production that people can experiment with.  

What affordable technologies could we create to simplify things for rural farmers?  How could we educate them on sustainable practices?

mine is from WD Hoard

The rule to be observed in this stable at all times
toward the cattle
is that of patience and kindness.
A man’s usefulness in a herd ceases at once
when he loses his temper and bestows rough usage.
Men must be patient. Cattle are not reasoning beings.
Remember that this is the Home of Mothers.
Treat each cow as a Mother should be treated.
The giving of milk is a function of Motherhood;
rough treatment lessens the flow.
That injures me as well as the cow.
Always keep these ideas in mind in dealing with my cattle.

For instance: I want stats like it takes x pounds of feed to get y pounds of meat off of a pig, etc.

Before I get into this my own assumptions (I don't know very much about farming and livestock raising) are that Rabbits would provide the most meat per cost

Any thoughts on what I can do with a limited amount of time each year?   30-40 days a year onsite is probably the max.  How about any info on the actual lease price for that land at just over 2k/year for like 70 acres of land with good soils? It seems kinda low to me but maybe I'm wrong?
How about any other ideas?

Is there a good software where you can put statistics about irrigation like rain / temperatures / evapotranspiration ?
