Simply use either your mouse scroll wheel or the left and right arrow keys to look through all the characters. For the children

To use just extract all the files from the .zip into a folder and double click AwakeningClasses.exe.

It was made for personal use

EDIT: Just realized all the children with Donnel are messed up and are actually what the child would be with Kellam. Fixing now.

EDIT2: Fixed the Donnel problem. Redownload if you downloaded earlier.

So it seems that our sub has basically doubled since a few short weeks ago and I am seeing a ton of really awesome questions about certain features of the game which maybe are not fully explained properly. I just wanted to explain some of them to maybe ease the struggles of some players who are going through the game on normal/hard. (My lunatic guide will be coming out shortly)


**One of my characters is weak. How do I train them?**

There are a couple of ways. First you could use reeking boxes (probably the simplest method **on normal**. They only cost 500 gold on hard they are 4800.) On hard it gets a little bit more tricky because the price goes up. There are two main ways to get XP. Either do the DLC over and over again, THEY ARE SOMETIMES HARD**.

**What's the difference between spotpass and outworld gate? What is free and what isn't?**

The general consensus is that any paid DLC will be coming through the outworld gate. The outworld gate let's you permenantly buy challenge maps. You can play them as many times as you would like

 
**Should I overgrind?**

That depends on how comfortable you are feeling with the game. When I did my first run I definitely overgrinded and by chapter 12 I had 7 or 8 units with max stats and the best skills. It made the game too easy. On hard I would recommend spending some time to level up some of the weaker units you get later on in the game. **I know that theives, then just switch that unit to whatever class you want**

**What is this spotpass content and how do I access it?**

Ok when you are on the world map

1. Streetpass team. Thats a team you can set up to send out to other FE player so they can battle it

2. Bonus box is where you download characters from other FE titles and place them in your world. You can either fight them and if you beat them you get the new unit

3. Renown awards. You get rewards at different levels of renown. You get more renown by battling streetpass teams or collecting more bonus box units.

4. Double Duel. Challengs your friend's units. You basically compete to kill off computer controlled units in a 2v1 battle. 

5. Avatar logbook. Lets you summon other units from different playthroughs into your world. Here's an example of avatars from other games. www.imgur.com/NeCtzgS


**What are second seals and master seals?**

Ok so a master seal will promote a base class to an advanced class. Cavalier to paladin (or great knight) lord to great lord, if you have a unit that is an advanced class (let's say a swordmaster) you can change them into another advanced class that you like better/has skills you need.
______________________________________________________________________________________________
*One thing I might add is that while Second Seals bring you back to level 1 as a different class
It's something that I couldn't find online, just for another skill?"" But yeah, nothing goes to waste. It's super exp efficient to use them early.*

Galeforce is easily the best skill in the game, they can attack 3 times that turn. I've also used it as a movement-extender in order to reach fleeing thieves. 

Anyway. It's good. So

* Lissa (Owain)
* Sumia (Cynthia)
* Maribelle (Brady)
* Cordelia (Severa)
* Olivia (Inigo)
* Tharja (Noire)
* Nowi (Nah)
* Sully (Kjelle)
* Cherche (Gerome)
* Panne (Yarne)
* Miriel (Laurent)
* MU (male or female) (Morgan)
* Chrom (Lucina)

Of the listed characters

* Lissa 
* Sumia
* Maribelle
* Cordelia
* Olivia
* MU (male or female)
* Gaius
* Donnel

The following three characters need to be matched with a male MU

* Tharja
* Nowi
* Sully

And that leaves Cherche

Regardless of your MU's gender

* Owain - Myrmidon
* Cynthia - Pegasus Knight
* Brady - Priest
* Severa - Mercenary
* Inigo - Mercenary**
* Morgan - base class of MU's spouse

If your MU is female, or Sully. 

* Noire - Archer
* Nah - Manakete
* Kjelle - Knight

If your MU is male, and MU marry Tharja, Nowi, and Sully (using whichever pairings you please). 

Chrom must marry Sumia, or MU for his child to have Galeforce. Given that his only other option is Sully anyway, that's usually not a problem. :P


*Children inherit the last equipped skill from both parents, while Pegasus Knight and Troubadour are female-only. Should a male Fighter or Barbarian have a female child, his classes will be translated into the female specific versions. Fighter turns into Pegasus Knight and Barbarian turns into Troubadour. 

**/u/waywrong points out that Olivia has a unique skill: Luck +4. You'll have to choose which to pass down to Inigo; this is mostly a moot point unless you want to do some luck-based shenanigans (such as permanent Armsthrift,,False,self,t5_2t0cn,1361153513.0,,True

Eventually, one the more difficult jRPGs around. He loved making his own avatar (named Jackson, of course) and I am convinced he would have thrown the whole thing down in boredom if he didn't have the avatar character in there. It was just a huge selling point to him. He wasn't a great reader yet (though he could read some), so he skipped all the tutorials and most of the story he just mashed through, so I gave him the cliff's notes versions as he went. He had a little trouble maneuvering characters around at first, and the concept of ""select button"" and ""cancel button"" for navigating menus seemed alien to him, but he picked it up quickly enough. 

Trying to explain the finer details of weapon triangle and ranged attacks was pretty much a lost cause

I felt so accomplished just showing him how the game worked and then watching him play four maps without pausing for air until his sister demanded a turn to take more 3D pictures.

**CLASS SETS AND RESPECCING**

When you gain a new member, for example, can change from his beginning Archer class to a Mage or a Wyvern Rider. Each of these classes can further promote to one of two advanced classes, which you can also spec out of freely. So Virion could end up as a [](#s ""Sniper, Bow Knight, Wyvern Lord, Griffon Rider, or Dark Knight""). Lots of options! Your MU can become any class (outside of gender-specific incompatible classes). You should keep in mind how you want each character to end up

**STATS**

When a character levels up

When you change classes, expect her to hit like a kitten with polio. This is an interesting mechanic because it means each character has its own 'spin' on each class (Sumia makes a quick, double-hitting knight while Vaike makes a high-damage thief). It's a big factor early in the game, but later you can always bring any unit's stats to the class ceiling, explained below.

Each class has a ceiling for each stat, the game will lower your stats but remember how many gains you have, so they will be back where they were before when you respec back to the better class.

**SKILLS**

At levels 1 and 10 (normal classes), taguel, manakete), your character will unlock a permanent skill depending on what class it is. For example, if Vaike becomes a level 10 fighter, he will get a permanent +5 crit bonus that he keeps no matter what class he is. The more you respec and explore each character's class options, the more skills you will pick up.

This also means that exploring a base class past level 10 does nothing for you. You will continue to accumulate the stat gains of the class so you won't fall behind and end up with a weak character

**LEVEL AND RELATIVE POWER**

You characters' levels mean absolutely nothing when it comes to the units' power. You can ignore it entirely when you're trying to compare your units together. A level 1 character can be twice as powerful and gain experience half as quickly as a level 18 character. The only thing that level means to you is how close you are to earning the next skill for that class.

Alright

http://serenesforest.net/fe13/children.html

I'm going to be going through this step-by-step so that hopefully you can figure out how the systems works a little bit for yourself instead of just scrolling down to the bottom and copying what I've put there. Although I will think no less of you if you do so. Also, but I did it for Noire. I don't care what you say Tharja is like Overattatched Girlfriend with creepy curse powers. When I go through on Lunatic I'll probably go Nowi x MU even though I find that a little creepy as well since she looks 13. Or maybe Sully, idk. Whatever. Let's get on with the guide.

Ok

So, although if it's not gender-exclusive like Galeforce you don't need to bother with the Male/Female distinction. Male MU and Chrom are special since they're the only males with children, but for now it's easiest to think of them as mothers.

Note that the male-only Fighter class will turn into the female-only Pegasus Knight class (and by extension Dark Flier/Galeforce) upon passing it down to a daughter.

**Access to Galeforce - Female Children** (Children will always have access to Galeforce)

Sumia - Cynthia

Cordelia - Severa

MU (Male) - Morgan (F) (Although MU does not have access to Galeforce he will always pass down the Dark Flier class to Morgan (F))

**Access to Galeforce - Male Children** (Children must inherit Galeforce from their mothers)

Lissa - Owain

Olivia - Inigo

Maribelle - Brady

MU (Female) - Morgan (M)

**No Access to Galeforce - Female Children** (Children must inherit the Dark Flier class from a father's Fighter class)

Sully - Kjelle

Chrom - Lucina (Must marry a female that can pass down the Dark Flier class)

Tharja - Noire

Nowi - Nah

**No Access to Galeforce - Male Children** (Unfortunately

Cherche - Gerome

Panne - Yarne

Miriel - Laurent

Okay

Gaius

Donnel

Male MU

Don't ask me why Vaike doesn't pass down Fighter ---&gt; Pegasus Knight. I don't know. I haven't tested it

Anyways, Nowi, and Sully. Who you pair with who out of these three fathers (MU (Male), Donnel, and Gaius) and mothers doesn't matter so you have some freedom.

Now, MU (Male)) their children will always have access to Dark Flier so you don't need to worry about who you pair them with or who you think fits them best or whoever gives the best class coverage/stat caps.

For mothers with male children (Lissa, and MU (Female))and access to Galeforce their children must receive the Galeforce skill via inheritance because as males they will not be able to access the Dark Flier class.

For mothers without access to Galeforce and male children (Miriel, unfortunately their children cannot get Galeforce.

**Frequently Asked Questions**

Q: Why do I care about this guide?

A: You're reading it.

Q: How do I choose which skill to pass on?

A: The last skill equipped will be passed on. Please note that the inherited skill is determined when you enter the sidequest to recruit the kid

Q: Is Galeforce really *that* good?

A: Yes, and then run back out of enemy range. If you have two Galeforce units you can pair them up and have one of them get a kill, move to the next enemy, switch, then the second Galeforce unit can get the kill and activate Galeforce AGAIN.

Q: What if I want to go for a different skill/class?
A: You can do the same process of dividing the mothers into four groups

**tl;dr** here's what I did.

No unique skills means that they don't have access to any skills that their kids won't

Chrom (Will always pass Aether) x Sumia (No unique skills): Both kids will get Galeforce via Sumia's classes.

Frederick (No unique skills) x Olivia (Galeforce) : Inigo gets the female-only Galeforce. Freddy gives awesome class coverage.

Stahl (No unique skills) x Lissa (Galeforce): Another male character getting the female-only Galeforce.

Henry (No unique skills) x Maribelle (Galeforce): Brady gets Galeforce via inheritance.

Gaius (Sol) x Sully (No unique skills): Gaius' male-only fighter becomes Peg Knight for Galeforce. Sol's probably the best of the unique skills here.

Kellam (No unique skills) x Cordelia (Galeforce): Class coverage from Kellam + Galeforce from Corelia.

Vaike (No unique skills) x Cherche (Renewal): No Galeforce. Vaike gives good class coverage. Still kind of confused about Renewal. Serene's Forest lists it as a unique inheritable for Gerome

Ricken (No unique skills) x Panne (Strength +2): Kinda meh options with Panne.

Lon'qu (No unique skills) x Miriel (Renewal): Maximum class coverage due to no Galeforce. Renewal is still really nice though.

MU (Counter) x Tharja: MU's male-only Fighter class becomes Peg Knight for Galeforce pwnage. Morgan and Noire both get the male-only counter.

Donnell (Aptitude) x Nowi (No unique skills): Donnell's fighter = Peg Knight. Aptitude is cool too

*Warning: Some spoilers/etc.*

I heard about the FE series for the first time a few months ago when a couple of friends were talking about Awakening coming out and how they were going to buy a 3DS for this one game. I had two thoughts going through my mind when I heard this, Mario Kart, etc., and couldn't really fathom a single game weighing in enough to warrant a 3DS purchase.

*Let me get this out of the way that I am pretty sure there are a handful of these posts from first time FE players on this subreddit every week

Continuing on

I started this journey with only a fraction of the interest that I ended it with. Having finished the story one time through I can definitely say this is one of my all time favorites and will probably be replayed and beaten to death over and over for the next few years

**Getting started**

Well, made the character, watched the cinematic, and was on my way. Looking back on it, the game did an amazing job of introducing a new player to the series considering the daunting complexity behind the game and its mechanics. The closest thing I have played to FE prior to Awakening was Pokémon. I was basically going into this blind. Regardless, I quickly learned what I needed to know to perform the basic functions such as moving and attacking thanks to the short, concise ""Guide"".

**Dialogue**

Early on I realized how perfect the balance between ""voiced"" dialogue and text would be. A fully voiced dialogue can be a hindrance to the flow of a game

**Difficulty**

One thing I picked up over the years is to choose the ""middle"" or ""highest"" difficulty when playing a new game. Most games I tackle these days are way too forgiving on ""Easy"" and usually ""Medium""(or in this case Hard) is more akin to ""Easy"" for games of the past. This game, often making me redo missions when one of my favorite characters would die, I never felt cheated. Every obstacle had a solution and every solution could be fine tuned to be more efficient. I found myself critically thinking about my strategies all the way from mapping out my character progression and abilities to positioning and formation, which would vary from map to map. The game forces the you to use your wits to complete each stage and rewards the player with a sense of accomplishment and experience. It's a pretty rare occurrence to find myself learning new tricks and maneuvers right up until the very end of a game these days. Fire Emblem: Awakening did not fall short in this regard.

**Story** 

There isn't much to tell in regards to the finer details. The game had an interesting story, or inspiring tales of courage and heroism, but there was something deeper and equally enriching in it's own right. To illustrate this, let me explain how I perceived Awakening:

[SPOILERS](#s ""The story had a familiar

Sorry if the formatting of that was a tad confusing, sure, but it would be a stretch to say this story was anything close to a ""masterpiece"".

Despite the story being straight forward and at times cliché/cheesy

**The Characters**

This is what makes Fire Emblem: Awakening. The characters have a plethora of interactions with one another and huge amounts of dialogue between them. Two characters' dialogues and interactions might not amount to a whole lot, a story told from the perspective of a tactician(the player) who interacts with, and is one of, the many characters of the game. You become attached to the characters, not wanting to give them up or let them meet a gruesome end at an enemy's lance, and that makes the game enjoyable on a fundamental level.

Never before have I been so moved by characters who spoke so little. I didn't just talk to them and listen to their conversations. You are interjected into the story and get to be part of the ragtag group. You're not just a mysterious overseer, and growing individual relationships you become attached to your allies. Their deaths sadden you. The fear that one might die exists. The suspense that something might happen to one of them persuades you to play smart and accomplish the mission with everyone surviving. You will genuinely care about the means to an end. I didn't want to, nor could justify, sacrificing a comrade to beat a mission. The emotional attachment to your characters as they battle together, grow accustomed to one another, and many times 'seal the deal' with marriage is unrivaled by most games that I have played prior to Awakening.

So while the story is nothing extraordinary, and character development in Fire Emblem: Awakening is the reason it is one of the finest in the games in the industry.

**The Music**

The music is great. It has its quirky, and arguably *very* good. The tracks are never distracting and the tend to stick with you. A sign of a good game is when you finish it and revisiting the soundtrack imbues you with nerd-chills and emotions. The music, while not the best of any game I have played, speaks for the quality of the game as a whole. No corners were cut all the way down to the sound track. [SPOILER](#s ""Having chosen to sacrifice myself at the end"") of the game followed by the reactions of the characters to my decision really sunk in and the emotions are easily be brought back up by something as simple as [listening to the soundtrack](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4QTEzsCRIE). *That*, my friends, is what makes this soundtrack so good.

**Conclusion/TL;DR**

This game was great. I dumped 50-60 hours on my first play through on Hard/Classic with it being my first Fire Emblem game. Needless to say, but I can say this: If you are reading this post, have a 3DS, and have not played a Fire Emblem game or specifically Awakening, get to it! The game, while not the best ever made, is a high quality work that I can't imagine anyone being disappointed with. Easily one of my favorites to date. Now if you excuse me

I miss the fact that Swordmasters and Snipers are pretty underwhelming sure they have some nice skills and all but especially for the Swordmasters critical hit rate be higher. This was my favorite class and anyone who was a myrmidon was in my book an automatic badass that turned into a swordmaster and could just about kill anything.

Another little annoyance is that as much as I hate to say it I actually kind of miss the soldier/lancemen class. This came to when I found out that I recruit Nephenee the equivalent of a swordmaster but with lances but instead I found out that instead she is a knight class instead and that disheartened me a little.  She was one of my best characters in Path of Radiance but now she doesn't maintain any of her noteworthy stats that she should have had from the previous game.  

I think this one had a bunch of other people as well as me confused

Lastly I feel as though for the DLC characters that they should have just left the characters their actual classes why only give them special skills that just instead makes them a semi different soldier? Why not keep the classes as they were and just be considered a special class like they did with Marth?

8-4:Speaking of doing something difererent

Kusakihara:(Laughs) Well
The idea was to add a unique sort of deformation to the characters. As for why it ended up like this... At the start of the project, and then there's nothing below that for the ankles and the feet. This makes it a bit easier to apply animation to models as well. We found out afterward that, with the 3DS, we had more than enough CPU strength available to flesh out the models a bit, add real ankles and so on. We were like ""Well, if there's a next time, maybe there'll be more ankles..."" (laughs) 
We thought we could make it something that would work well with the characters, I think it's kind of cute, though! (laughs) Isn't it? They look like they're wearing high heels. Aren't high heels the big fashion these days? 

8-4:Did you get any feedback about this from Japanese players as well?

Kusakihara: Yeah, you're using handheld weapons for the most part, so we figured we could sort of omit some of the detail down there...

Yokota:We did get feedback about that in the playtesting sessions

There is a ton of misinformation surrounding some of the more dubious features of the game such as DLS, second seals and item/exp farming. 

I just beat FE:A so I thought I would provide some insight.


**There is no arena!!!! ?**: The short answer is reeking boxes. They cost 500 gold and place an enemy team at the location you are standing on when you use it. (Some people think it is random). Furthermore

**How do I access DLC?**: There are a couple of ways:

1. Push X when you are on the world map and go to wireless. With spotpass activated, maps etc via the ""bonus box"". This is how you summon previous characters into your world. To recruit the characters, go to where they spawned and either buy them (if you have the cash) or during battle you must defeat their team and talk to their leader with chrom.

2. After chapter 4 or 5 the outworld gate spawns on the map. Go to it to buy/download DLC when available.

**THE ONLY MAP DLC RIGHT NOW IS FREE TILL MARCH

**What is the difference between a master seal/second seal?**:

A master seal will promote  your unit's base class to the advanced class of your choosing. For example

NOW a second seal is WAY more fun. Let's say I get a new character and it is a myrmidon and I HATE myrmidons. I can use a second seal to change them into let's say

Now. Let's assume I went Myrmidon-&gt;level ten (use second seal) to fighter-&gt;level 15 (use master seal) to warrior. I can max out my warrior at lvl 20 and just have him sit there wasting valuable stat upgrades

Now, that's right. Your tactician can now be basically anything. Your tactican can learn all the skills in the game!!!!

**OMG seals are so expensive and I has no monies!**: Just wait. Make sure you unlock the skill despoil for as many characters as possible. Your luck becomes a % chance to find a small bullion after you kill an enemy. My Vaike has a 41% chance to find a bullion and I currently have 48 small bullions sitting in my convoy. On an average match against the risen that I have summoned via a reeking box,000 profit. Do that a few times and you can buy all the master seals/second seals your heart desires!!!

**Is this game hard?**: It depends on your difficulty. If you farm like crazy and do tons of promotes/max out stats

1. No pairing up

2. If a unit falls below 15% hp

3. A unit can only hold two weapons at once. 

4. I cannot use second seals

5. I cannot have more than one class

Stuff like that changes the flow of the game.

If there is anything else you guys are unsure of or if I wan't clear let me know. /r/fireemblem is here to help!

Formatting
-----
-----

This post will be used for signups. I will be organizing people into 4-people groups. If you wish to compete in this challenge

Each group will have their own separate posts that I will personally update to keep track of their turn count, I will do the drafting in a single comment thread. Each turn, just simply reply to the previous comment to select your characters. Each participant will start their own comment thread there to keep track of their turns. Participants can use any format to write as long as you mention the Chapter's number of turns and the overall number of turns. Make sure you update your comment instead of making a new comment so that we can keep things organized. I have a bit of OCD about organization, so if I feel things are getting out of hand, I will institute a **10-turn penalty**.

1373478712.0,1i0s16,For all Fire Emblem Fans who love Advance Wars,GrilledCheeseDreams,41,14,6,"I apologize in advance for not really staying on topic for this subreddit
I was thinking today about the differences between Advance Wars and Fire Emblem, and the fun ""all out war"" aspect of it. Fire Emblem on the other hand is more personal to me. I get engaged with the characters, the battles actually mean something to me because I don't know if my favorite character will make it out alive. That is what set these games apart from the relative shallowness of Advance Wars series. Though with the 3DS and the success of Awakening, I am hoping that their will soon will be an Advance Wars game in the works, though it will have to go toe-to-toe with the juggernaut of Fire Emblem to prove its worth. 
So here's my idea on how Advance Wars could really succeed on the 3DS

-First

-Second, like Fire Emblem. They will be full characters in the story, and will have special skills on their own. Kinda like CO skills only not as game changing. For example, having a saboteur character that can disable a factory for a few turns. Or a sniper that could hide himself in the mountains and pick off infantry.  They can either be stationed in a unit, or put on the front by themselves. Alone they can provide better individual bonuses and powers, but in a unit they can boost the stats of those fighting around them. They are the elite units who will need to be played strategically. You will have them fighting next to the more expendable troops, but you do not want to loose them. CO's will be able to build relationships and work better with certain secondary units

-Third, but just make sure that the story has some amount of seriousness to it. Maybe the story could have a time skip or a new universe to explore. Wars world is fun, but I really want to meet some new and exciting COs on the battlefield.

So I was just wondering what other people would think of these ideas. Feel free to add or critique anything!!

----------


Start by pairing Cherche and Vaike. Then have FeMU with +Strength/-whatever marry Gerome

An A support with any Warrior with more than 30 Strength adds 10. Give him a forged Hectors Axe that offers a combined Mt of 22. Then there's the obvious skills: 5 from Axefaire, 2 from All Stats, and 2 from, uh, Strength +2. Total bonuses: **61**

So with just a buddy and some skills

Now we can add some silly stuff. 4 from both Rally Spectrum and Strength, pushing us to **140**.

But then we're going to do something a *bit* extra. We'll take off Strength +2 in favor of Vengeance. Hah.

Once we drop poor Morgan's health to a mere 1, depending on his support bonuses and such), this will tack on a monstrous 39 extra attack for a ludicrous final attack rating of **177**.

**Edit:** As HiroariStrangebird and Lhyon have pointed out, and +1 more if the defender is using a Lance. That's **182** now, folks!


----------


Of course then I naturally got curious about how to create the best physical defense in the game. So here's that. I'll caveat by saying I'm going to ignore the Dragonskin skill

Anyway. Start with Kellam and Nowi, but he still puts us in the hole for -111. Let's add some other stuff.

A suitably tanky General buddy offers +10 in support Defense. Sadly, All Stats +2, Limit Breaker, and Defender (woo). From skills and supports, we manage to scrape up an extra **23**, for a running total of **89**. Hey look, we're sub-three digit damage now! 90 damage ain't so bad

The silly stuff is identical for defensive stats, but hey. The last step is standing on a Throne for 3 more defense, leaving us with a total of **110**. 

Now that we know the maximum Defense we can get

---------------------------

So I got through the first part of the final chapter with relative ease (the sniper gorgon's were a pain

Enter part 2 of the final chapter and I spend the first turn positioning all of my troops slightly closer to the Demon King so they may all be within attacking range for next turn. Then he goes ahead and summons a bunch of reinforcements haphazardly all over the map (nothing I hadn't really expected

Begin turn 3. HE FREAKIN' **MOVES!** The giant monstrosity that (graphically) takes up multiple tiles, so no counter attacking for me. He hits me of course, and leaves me with 9 health (I remember this part quite vividly, also it was about 30 minutes ago). And *this* is where I proceed to pretty much lose my shit...

Immediately following that huge attack, but still, those are odds I wouldn't take. Also, he's set to do 9 damage. **9 DAMAGE!!!** (in case you forgot, that's exactly how much health I had at that very moment). So he marches on up to me and attacks... and *misses* (whilst I have about 7 separate heart attacks in the span of 1 second). I think I might have actually started jumping up and down while Ross blew him to pieces with Garm.  Of course then I realized that killing him might have been a bad thing because now that spot is vacant... but not for long. A hellhound promptly walked on over and took the wight's place. The battle starts and I'm a little bit too... *ahem* [preoccupied](http://i.imgur.com/EwgSf8T.gif) to check the hit rates as I usually do, but I notice that he would do 5 damage... and that's exactly what he does, right before I gore him with Garm. Then the *other* hellhound decides he wants a shot, right? *Nope!* There's still a centaur (Maelduin) on the map with a longbow. He loads up and gets ready to try for a shot that would do 5 damage

So then I wrap it up pretty quickly giving the Demon King 2 shots from Ephraim's Siegmund (doing a buttload of damage), and go in for the killing blow with Ross wielding Garm, and *damn* did it feel good!

tl;dr: **ROSS IS BOSS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!**

I used my limit broken Chrom!Inigo for this, and with rightful king he has a theoretical 76 % proc rate assuming having the weapon on top of the skill has no effect. If the sword were to act as a second ""roll"" of Sol then with Sol having a 24% fail rate and a second 76% proc rate then it would be 76 + ..24x76 = about a 95% proc rate

While having both the sword and skill equipped, or 78 %. so it would seem that having both the weapon and skill doesn't affect the proc rate.

Morgan is speculated to come from a different timeline, if Morgan has siblings, her siblings remember Morgan despite them being from Lucina's timeline.


The reason for this is probably because in the ""future is in ruins"" timeline


I only said this to clear any confusion


My theory is that our Morgan is from the ""fixed"" timeline. The timeline where Grima is put to sleep/killed. There are a couple reasons for this. Morgan doesn't remember the future in ruins. Morgan also seems to remember an older version of her father


Not sure how exactly time travel works in this series (worldline, Morgan would have never been able to be with her father. I suppose you could argue that she was from a different worldline that also happened to stop Grima, but seeing the whole ""destiny"" was that the MU would become Grima, I think it is safe to say that the ""fixed"" timeline is unique in its prevention of Grima.


Another piece of evidence that isn't really based within the plot is the epliogue. Morgan's epilogue (unless you get extra paralogue characters like Tiki


The thing is, which is right after Morgan's epilogue. Because of the mention of the fairly pointless fact, followed by the whole ""and so they lived hapily ever after"", I think it is hinting towards Morgan being from that timeline.

1368233132.0,1e3qjs,Hello redditors of /r/Fireemblem! I'm here today to see how many of you would be interested in a forum based Fire Emblem rpg. (Details inside),Kennori,30,14,43,"Hello everyone

The premiss of this RPG is to allow a Player to Join a Clan/Guild/Country and then create a unit for the group they're in for them to control. Using your unit, or Fight in Battle royals for exp, gold or loot. You can think of this as a Forum Based Fire Emblem Dungeons and Dragons, using the same formulas and items and such from the games. We've done this before and those who participated enjoyed it, and trust me, when we have the system refined for FE: Awakening standards, I feel you all will enjoy it as well. 

Like I said, please let me know and apologies in advance.

EDIT: Well, where you get to choose your class and starting stats (which are allotted like Fallout or D&amp;D). During creation, the post will guide you though how Battles are decided and handled. (you'll learn how the game calculated Damage, Number of Hits, Hit chance and crit chance, then how to apply them based on your character vs who ever you're fighting.)

Then after your character is approved, one constant battle till a victor is decided.)

At high enough levels

Eventually, the Tactician will get back to you to find out how you level up, or what weapon you'd like to use if there's a choice.

Last time I was involved there where no deaths (if a unit died

Mind you

It's not ENTIRELY text based... there will be maps for main story battles. One of the funnest parts of this is designing how your character looks.

Combat on maps would go like this...

Lets say Nation 1 is fighting against an NPC Group (Monsters/Bandits/ect):

A tactician from Nation one will confer with the Nations leaders and choose who to use for the battle among the units available for their Nation. Place the units

Another Tactician will control the NPC's and move them accordingly to whats happening

This occurs until battle unfolds...

Lets say a Myrmidon for Nation 1 wishes to move to a square adjacent to a Risen Mercenary.

The controlling tactician will then calculate battle stats and odds between the Myrmidon and Merc, and the Merc will get one) then that players turn ends and the Tactician continues on with the next person.

This process ends until one side becomes the victor.

The beginning phases may happen over the course of a single day

TL;DR Do you like D&amp;D with Map battles? Yes? Do you like fire Emblem? Yes? Do you Enjoy Role Play? Yes? Then this is for you. If you said no to two of the three questions then this isn't for you.

Speaking of Map Battles

Thanks for taking the time to read :3


One of the Admins controls a forum where this will be hosted at (it'll have it's own area for this) When I feel comfortable with the amount of people interested

I've been a huge fan of Fire Emblem ever since the first one released in the States, because that shit sucked.  But I never got to a higher difficulty level than normal, so I never really had to think too hard about which characters to use on my team or how to min-max them, etc etc.  I have literally never bothered with optimizing supports, I always just hit the ""support"" option whenever it became available, not really caring who was supporting who and at what level.  I do know the basics of FE; don't promote characters until they hit 20, the seemingly weak villager turns out to be mad strong (Ross was my favorite unit in 8), and all that stuff.

So I got super pumped about Awakening, and you can go right back to level one and start again and all these new skills and reclassing, and holy shit they can have kids and you have to make sure the parents are supported right so you can get the best kid and you have to figure out which skills and classes to pass on...

I nearly had an aneurysm just typing that out.  Basically, but there's just so much stuff to worry about in this one, I don't know how to go about it.  I liked the old style, where everyone could promote once (or twice) and it was just so much easier to understand.  I guess I just need some help figuring out the best way to optimize my party, which units are worthwhile, how to reclass, which skills I need, and whether or not all that is actually stuff I need to bother with if I'm just playing on normal,self,

**Class Discussion Thread: Hero**

The hero class is a promotion of Fighters and Mercenaries. They wield Swords and Axes. Statswise, and vice versa for warriors. Typically they're considered the more balanced class.

Heroes learn two skills: Sol

Sol is the skill that they learn at level five. It allows them to recover half of the damage they deal out in HP, which makes it a great skill to pass down to children.

Axebreaker is one of the typical breaker skills

What do you guys think of this class? What are its weaknesses? Its strengths? What skills can you pass on to improve this class?

1360956708.0,18lgsg,A quick guide on stat caps,waywrong,21,4,6,"Before you go any further

Most places use the term Stat Max, but you can consider the terms cap and max to be interchangeable

----------------------------

There are two kinds of stat caps

**Class Stat Cap**

A class stat cap is the maximum in a stat your class will allow you have

For example, stat caps of basic classes are much lower than the caps of advanced classes

Class stat caps are the main things that people will be looking at when people are determining which class will be a character’s ending class.  If I want MU to have high Str to OHKO

**Character Stat Cap**

A character stat cap is a modifier to the class stat cap that is unique to each character.  This modifier is added onto the class stat cap to determine the actual stat cap for a character.

For example

Using an earlier example: 

Vaike as a swordmaster will have a Str cap of 38 (swordmaster) + 3 (Vaike’s modifier) for a total of 41. 

On the other hand, it will be one lower.

This is mainly what sets characters apart and makes them unique, which honestly should not matter unless you are a stat crunching minmaxing power gamer like me.

**Stat Caps and Children**

This is where things get interesting

Nowi has a Str cap of +1 and a Mag cap of +1.

Vaike has a Str cap of +3 and a Mag cap of –2.

This means that if they have a child

The child will also have a character Mag cap of 0. [-2 (Vaike) + 1 (Nowi) + 1 (bonus].

Thus

**Misc**

If you marry MU to a generation II character, however, they will get the bonus from MU’s caps.  

So if you marry Sully to Chrom

**Class Discussion Thread: Swordmaster**

The Swordsmaster is the promotion of the Myrmidon. They wield exclusively swords. Statwise, which is just above dark fliers and tricksters. They also have relatively low Defense and a mediocre Resistance cap. However, they also have the highest base Speed cap in FE13, tying with the assassin at 46 Speed. This makes them rather fragile while being hard to catch. 

They have several weaknesses

Swordmasters learn two skills: Astra and Swordfaire. They also learn the skill Vantage as a myrmidon. (This skill is fairly useful

Vantage is a skill Myrmidons learn at level 10. It allows them to attack first during enemy turns while their health is below 50%. This is a very strong skill that allows low health swordmasters to kill their attackers instead of being killed

Astra is the Swordmaster's signature skill, which allows the warrior to get in more counter damage than he would be able to normally.

Swordfaire is the Swordmaster's final skill, making them a bit more effective. It's also great on other classes that could use the strength, like Assassins or Tricksters.

The Swordmaster is an incredibly powerful class overall, or Pavise help a lot with their defensive issues against enemies with higher accuracy.

2: Hector and Lyndis - the constant banter is a huge example

3: Isadora and Harken - He even renews his proposal with their final support

4: Kent and Fiora - this support is actually hilarious to watch as both characters lose their formal tone. Her reaction to Sain's advances are what you would expect

5: Erk and Priscilla - aside from the fact that he is the only one who can marry her, priscilla asks about his relationship with serra, and her apparent jealousy disappears after finding out that erk hates serra. 

6: Nino and Jaffar - thier love is explicitly stated in their last support, but his feelings are not reciprocated. 

7: Dart and Farina - this one is a bit weird, and kent, who is kind of stoic and does not respond well to her. With both of them paired with better partners, Farina is free to pair with the free spirited dart. 

8: Lowen and Rebecca - she's obviously smitten as soon as he rode in to save her village from bandits, who hits on every girl, or will, who she grew up with. This leaves Lowen, whose chivalry is passed on to their son Wolt, who is Roy's friend. 

9: Serra and Oswin - this one is perfect. he is the one that shuts her up in the first two supports, even noting that they are only 14 years apart (WTF!?!).

**The Basics**  
Hello my fellow tacticians! I'm here to ~~start arguments~~ because I wanted to play out a what-if character VS battle scenario with our favorite lords! Sixteen heroes have been gathered and randomly put into a double-elimination style bracket.

Each matchup

***
**The Rules**  

1. Vote on who you think would win. Characters are assumed to be equal level in their most-promoted **canon class**. They also have access to any weapon they can wield in that class.  

2. Regular FE battle rules do not apply. No turn order

3. Give rationale for your choice! Explain why you think one character would best the other in the comments! This can be anything

4. You have roughly 24 hours from the time each round opens to vote before the next round begins.  

5. EDIT **PLEASE** don't cheat. One response per person
***
Good luck

(24-25) This would be the age Laurent after he went to the past. This might also be the age of Emmeryn

(30-40) Gregor, and Basillo look way older than the rest of the characters in the game. So I would say that would be in their mid 30s.

It had been a furious fight. Hector had shown that he had learned much from his last match with Ike... he feinted, the great hero of Tellius was even disarmed! It seemed like game over for the mercenary commander, but Ike once again proved that to compared to him, there is no equal fighter. One of the silhouettes lies on the ground.

The silence is broken by a single voice. The arena master beckons to the standing man.  
**“Finish him.”**  
And so it was that Ike, raised his golden blade in triumph, and just as swiftly brought it down into the back of the face-down Hector. He grimaced one last time before fading away.

“Blast! I'll get you... next time... Ike...”

Ephraim was fast to move his lance in retaliation, and no matter what he did, Hector would not go down. Ephraim smiled. It had been awhile since he had a fight this enjoyable. He looked up, speaking three last words before fading away:

**The Basics**  
Hello my fellow tacticians! I'm here to ~~start arguments~~ because I wanted to play out a what-if character VS battle scenario with our favorite lords! Sixteen heroes have been gathered and randomly put into a double-elimination style bracket.

Each matchup

***
**The Rules**  

1. Vote on who you think would win. Characters are assumed to be equal level in their most-promoted **canon class**. They also have access to any weapon they can wield in that class.  

2. Regular FE battle rules do not apply. No turn order

3. Give rationale for your choice! Explain why you think one character would best the other in the comments! This can be anything

4. You have roughly 24 hours from the time each round opens to vote before the next round begins.  

5. **PLEASE** don't cheat. **One response per person**

Possible Fathers: Chrom, Stahl, Vaike, Kellam, Donnel, Lon'qu, Ricken, Gregor

**[Vote Here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1-O6qtuAIfO5MUCTzagq-Q5xUSPwAsav9efWZ-NP5Efk/viewform)** (if there are more/as many votes as there are responses I will use the vote to determine the winner/runner up)

**Rules**:

1. Parents are not limited. I.e. The same parent can be an answer for any of the children. This is not an ""Ideal Pairings for a Playthrough""

1. Because MU is the best parent for each child, you can post your ""MU Build"" for that child character.

1. Give your rationale for why that character is makes the best parent. Could be skills, synergy or something else!

1. Vote in the poll!

When I went to Atlus, I was told that Shin Megami Tensei together with Fire Emblem is what I wanted. So, I soon said that to Intelligent Systems and started this very special collaboration. Oops! I shouldn’t say that the game takes place in the real world. We haven’t announced it, right?
    - Others: Not really.
    - Masahiro Higuchi: Not yet.
    - Tohru Narihiro: Well, mixing these kind of ideas. I’m sure you’ll get to see the birth of a new franchise and interesting ideas. 

So, possibly real time gameplay and instead of all demons like in SMT the demons might be replaced with FE characters?

**Today's Matchups**

Ephraim Vs. Hector!!!  

***
**The Basics**  
Hello my fellow tacticians! I'm here to ~~start arguments~~ because I wanted to play out a what-if character VS battle scenario with our favorite lords! Sixteen heroes have been gathered and randomly put into a double-elimination style bracket.

Each matchup

***
**The Rules**  

1. Vote on who you think would win. Characters are assumed to be equal level in their most-promoted **canon class**. They also have access to any weapon they can wield in that class.  

2. Regular FE battle rules do not apply. No turn order

3. Give rationale for your choice! Explain why you think one character would best the other in the comments! This can be anything

4. You have roughly 24 hours from the time each round opens to vote before the next round begins.  

5. **PLEASE** don't cheat. One response per person

So
I wanted advice for my streetpass team, and TF2 seemed like the easiest choice.

My team will consist of the 9 mercenaries + Saxton Hale, here's what I got so far:

Owain ( swordmaster ) as the Scout
Skills: Galeforce, Avoid +10, Movement +1
The skillset references the Scout gameplay: he's the fastest

MU
Skills: Sol, Lethality to crits and Rally Spectrum to buff banner.

Noire ( sorcerer )
Skills: Hex, Lethality ( Henry only ). The first 3 skills are a reference to the airblast that helps avoids most projectile, Noire's skills refers to the axetinguisher + degreaser combo and extend the list of projectile avoidable, Henry's lethality refers to the weapon combo already mentionned. The main advantage of Henry is the DF class, that allows him to use both fire tome and axe, but it's up to preference, they're both crazy enough to be pyromaniac on drugs.

Basilio ( hero ) as the Demoman
Skills: Sol
This skillset is a reference to the Eyelander/any melee weapon + Targe combo

Gregor ( berserker ) as the Heavy
Skills: Sol
Sol is a reference to the sandvich

Donnel as the Engineer ( any class, Skills: armsthrift, every rally skill you can get with him, Sol.
They act as reference to the fact the the engineer never runs out of ammo and is more of a support type character with the dispenser.

Libra ( sage ) as the Medic
Skills: Renewal
That's all I can think of

Gaius ( assassin ) as the Sniper
Skills: Lethality, he will use a large bow.

Kellam ( assassin ) as the Spy ( and married to Lissa
Skills : Pass
referencing the Spy gameplay : get behing the enemy line

Walhart ( conqueror ) as Saxton Hale
Skills : Conqueror, Pavise, Swordbreaker.
Just the most powerful Walhart I could think of.

That's all I got for now

Annoyance two would be the lack of a magic based bow, or a mage, but she is holding a bow in her picture, and I can't seem to bring myself to do it.

Finally I am constantly bugged by the fact that the levin sword/bolt axe/shockstick all have the same animation (no matter the range).  I thought that they could have implemented something better than when Owain activates astra with a levin sword he just repeats the same animation 5 times...  I guess the dev team had a lot on their hands

Well when you get the Avatar next to them (Avatar has to be married) they will say something like ""Is that Master Grima? It can't be its been ages since master took that form. Must be that damn divine dragon Naga messing with my heart i can't fight them.. forgive me master"" and they teleport away from the map. In Future Past 3 when you defeat Grima/Avatar they say Morgan please forgive me i put you through so much. Which got me this idea that the Avatar before his body died blocked out the Morgans memories and sent them back in the past to live a life without all that darkness. 

The Harvest Scramble DLC conversation with Owain and Male Morgan got me thinking about my theory. Morgan says he remembered something from his past but passed out or something and cant remember what it was and Owain says ""your memories have clearly been sealed away with some kind of evil curse!"" and ""you didn't lose your memories. They were deliberately sealed away! And whatever fiend did it cursed you to fall unconscious if that seal was threatened!"" Then in the next conversation Owain starts yelling about its the Grimleal's doing fight it


So that is my theory i wonder what you guys think about it and if you guys have any theories about Morgan post in the comments i would love to read them.

Another odd pairing that I find works is Gregor!Owain - while there's some class overlap

Hello my fellow tacticians! I'm here to ~~start arguments~~ because I wanted to play out a what-if character VS battle scenario with our favorite lords! Sixteen heroes have been gathered and randomly put into a double-elimination style bracket.

Each matchup

***
**The Rules**  

1. Vote on who you think would win. Characters are assumed to be equal level in their most-promoted **canon class**. They also have access to any weapon they can wield in that class.  

2. Regular FE battle rules do not apply. No turn order

3. Give rationale for your choice! Explain why you think one character would best the other in the comments! This can be anything

4. You have roughly 24 hours from the time each round opens to vote before the next round begins.  

5. **PLEASE** don't cheat. One response per person

**STREETPASS AI:**
From what I've seen, they never pair, and fight pretty much like sheep to slaughter..

This leads me to believe that each unit should be fairly self sufficient in order to be a threat to a human player. The only exception i can think of here are rally abilities and AOE buffs/debuffs/heals. (things like solidarity, renewel, staff heals, rally spectrum, etc)

This makes a convincing argument to the importance of rallys to boost allies

**OFTEN DISCUSSED (OP?) SKILLS:**
Limiting factors for skills. You only get 5. If you assume limit break mandatory (who wouldn't? it's a giant stat boost) you're left with 4 skills.

 In my opinion, slowly chipping away at their digital companions HP while preserving your own, and destroying their human spirit (sorry, I'm a little evil. maybe that's why i married Tharja...). So what makes you hard to kill?

 - **Defensive skills**
   - **aegis and pavise:** just dumb abilities with high proc rates after limit break. most importantly
   - **miracle:** oh shit! i'm dead. jk. i'm find. I'll kill you next turn after renewal. T.T my only gripe with this skill is how annoying it is to acquire. Train a priest/cleric until 10? eh... i'll just use other skills.
   - **breakers:** really good if you can get core weaknesses alleviated
   - **lucky 7:** i'm think if you have an extra slot

 - **Healing abilities:**
   - **renewal:** live past the human onslaught? good. come back and fight again next turn with free health.
   - **lifetaker:** not recommended unless you have someone who can kill any given enemy human in one turn (unlikely since humans pair up for super awesome advantages).
   - **any sorc with nosferatu:** do dmg AND heal without guaranteed? sure. ok.
   - **armsthrift:** this really has it's own place
   - **sol:** high proc rate. who doesn't love this skill? My only gripe is that it affects the proc-ing of...
 - **Offensive skills**
   - **vengeance:** great on sorcs or anyone who you didn't get sol for. lol
   - **luna:** i think after limit break, they still got 5 armor above base. but you got 10 more attack..
   - **wrath:** great with vantage/astra
   - **astra:** personally, but why hit for miniscule amounts 5 times when you can hit once for a significant amount? especially when only one is allowed to proc?
   - **vantage:** I think this is an amazing skill to pair with luna and wrath/vengeance. for street pass on people without aegis/pavise i feel it's pretty damn useful/critical
   - **lethality:** pro: insta-kill if you're lucky enough to proc it. more a chance play than anything. cons: can be blocked by guard
   - **counter:** honestly had no idea where to put counter. it's nice

**PERSONAL CONCLUSION:**
Key points:

 - only one defensive and offensive skill can be proced each attack animation.
 - crits can happen on anything.
 - to my knowledge

I believe that aegis and pavise together with some sort of heal (sol/renewal) is really strong/annoying. the first three have high proc rates which will make you hard to kill if you can hurt them at all.

If the class you give sol to has low str/mag

I have toyed with the idea of lethality

I also think that for the children of MU, pavise, and healing dark magic make for unkillable killing machines.

Galeforce is great in grinding and story play

I don't know

**TL;DR: the harder your units are to kill by themselves

**GRINDING TIP:** for those of you grinding like me

if you don't have strong units for that

I've noticed that the minimum exp gain for killing a unit is 8

Personally I run 2 Grandmasters with Pair Ups ;on my Avatar's I use a pair I want to get Support levels on atm (subject to change once I max all my current available support levels; I'm a completionist whore and am aiming to have A rank supports on everyone), extremely useful in conjunction with Mug/Despoil. My Avatar is female so it can't run Mug (Barbs are male-only), so instead I get Leif's Sword (gives you Mug as long as you're using that weapon) + Armsthrift, which gives you (Luck x 2)% chance to not use up durability on weapons when you normally would. Her Luck is only 47 though, so I'm forced to use the occasional Hammerne to make up for the lost durability (though one 20/20 Leif's Sword lasts me at least 40-50 runs). Note that Mug and Leif's Sword *only apply when you're attacking on your turn*. Which is unfortunate because 75% of my enemies kill themselves on my units by attacking them during their turn. 

This combination nets me a whopping average of 7 Bullion(S)s per Reeking Boxes (the map I grind on guarantees 4 Bullion(S)s)

Skills and important stats are:

Avatar: Galeforce, Acrobat, Renewal

Luck is only 47, but they put the Luck bonus skill on a dumb class that I can't reclass into :(

Morgan: Armsthrift, Renewal, Mug/Despoil

With his waifu paired up with him he gets 58 total Luck, but nonetheless he gets Bullions regularly. 

This combination is also good for profiting simply because you never have to replace your weapons (unless you're me and get really unlucky with the goddamn 6% chance to lose 1 durability on Leif's Sword -_-)

1372452898.0,1h9tb7,A Potentially Interesting Lore Theory Connecting FE4 and FE7 [Spoilers for FE3/4/6/7],Lhyon,12,1,6,"Strap on your tinfoil hats

 **Note that this theory goes fairly in depth into lore that never made its way over to the states. If you are familiar with FE7 and not FE4

 

Before we get to the main point

 

A fundamental basis of this theory is another theory, the Divine Dragon / Earth Dragon war does not start until at least around two thousand years after the events of FE7, as FE7 itself is around 1000 years after the Scouring.

 

For our purposes, is unimportant, as there is no indication from primary sources Nils and Ninian that the Golden Age of the Dragon Tribe was in progress before the arrival of the Elibean dragon tribes.

 

With the advent of Awakening, mysterious warping powers, proximity to the ancient dragon city of Thabes), and there is no better candidate that has appeared. There is still the possibility, however, that the dragons of Elibe existed at the same time as the dragons of Archanea, and the Ending Winter was the catalyst for the Divine Dragon / Earth Dragon war in Archanea

 

While I cannot eliminate this as a possibility, initially apprehensive or hostile towards the dragons, but with no long-term conflict occurring. This fits with what we know of Archanea at the time - it was not until 500 years after the Divine Dragon / Earth Dragon war that the first solid human political entity appeared on the continent. Furthermore, the Greco-Roman style of the temple shown in the CG is consistent with other structures in Archanea - though this is less indicative of anything, as temples generally tend towards such an architectural style in fantasy works. Furthermore, I am of the opinion that the Elibe -&gt; Archanea theory makes for a more compelling narrative in general, so in the absence of any significant body of proof for the alternate hypothesis

 

With that out of the way

 

 

To put it simply

 

 

To substantiate this claim

 

Nils is a ""young"" (1000 or so) year old half-ice dragon. Whether or not he knows of his human heritage is questionable, given that he disguises himself as a bard when on the run from the Black Fang. He is initially distrustful of humans, but throughout the events of FE7 he comes to gain a much greater respect for them, changing his opinion on the species that drove him and his kin from Elibe.

 

Of the 12 dragons who descended upon the crusaders at Darna, as throughout the Fire Emblem series ice and wind magics are very closely associated with one another. Of all the dragons, he was the most passionate about helping humanity, and thus was largely responsible for the Miracle occurring. In the second half of Genealogy, he possesses Lewyn - a man known for previously disguising himself as a simple, flute-playing scarf-wearing Bard. Throughout the second part of the game, Forseti (in Lewyn's body) shows consistent and notable concern for children - not only is his first priority rescuing the child prisoners taken by the worshippers of Loptyr in their Child Hunts, he only shows real empathy when Tinny recounts the tale of being tortured by Hilde as a girl.

 

Nils being Forseti explains many of the notable and curious aspects of the dragon's character. It explains why, (to the extent that he would inhabit a human's body for almost two decades) because he alone has had his faith in humanity restored through the events of FE7. It explains why he is so passionate about saving the children from the dark mages of the Lopt Sect, because he has first-hand knowledge of the fear and hopelessness of their situation. The fact that he is the son of one of the most powerful sorcerers on Elibe might explain why his Holy Blood gives magical bonuses, or how a relatively young dragon was one of the 12 most powerful alive (And though Nils never gets a chance to use his abilities, remember that Ninian oneshots two Fire Dragons with magic immediately after being resurrected, which might be indicative of power that runs in the family).

 

Additionally, but ""Nils"" is hardly a name that a dragon would go by. It's also perfectly reasonable to assume that the dragon siblings were either given a ""dragon"" name and a ""human"" name at birth, or took pseudonyms when they were on the run in Elibe. Additionally, Fa is precedent for dragons going by different names when around humans that they do when around other dragons.

 

In the end, and offers an interesting take on who is ultimately one of the most important characters in the series.

**Today's Matchups**

Ike Vs. Hector!!!  

Lucina Vs. Ephraim!!!

**The Basics**  
Hello my fellow tacticians! I'm here to ~~start arguments~~ because I wanted to play out a what-if character VS battle scenario with our favorite lords! Sixteen heroes have been gathered and randomly put into a double-elimination style bracket.

Each matchup

***
**The Rules**  

1. Vote on who you think would win. Characters are assumed to be equal level in their most-promoted **canon class**. They also have access to any weapon they can wield in that class.  

2. Regular FE battle rules do not apply. No turn order

3. Give rationale for your choice! Explain why you think one character would best the other in the comments! This can be anything

4. You have roughly 24 hours from the time each round opens to vote before the next round begins.  

5. **PLEASE** don't cheat. One response per person

1370190986.0,1fiwvo,Luna/Crit build - an alternative to Lethality,asakyun,12,1,6,"So I was theorycrafting for streetpass

What you'll need

- Swordmaster or Sorcerer

- Sol Katti or Ruin (More Sol Kattis from DLC)

- Limit Breaker (obviously)

- Character that can get Luna

- Access to Barbarian

- Aggressor


Pros:

- Compared to the maximum 3 characters that can use Lethality-RK

- At its highest potential (using Gamble), compared to 24% chance of Lethality-RK.

Cons:

- No access to Brave weapons or consecutive hit weapons

- Class access is extremely restricted


Note that the full potential of this build only comes out when a character on your streetpass team is at half HP

This theory works on this basis - 1.5x the enemy's def/res is added to your own damage when you activate Luna on a critical. Thus

Proccing a Luna-crit on a maxed LB General using the Sol Katti will add (1.5 times 60 = 90) damage to your attack

Luna-crit build is also a lot more attainable than the Lethality-RK build and has about the same activation rate (appx. 25%). You assume that you have 54% chance to get Luna, at 18.72%. (Alternatively Aversa!Morgan w/ shadowgift + Sage can make up for the crappiness of Ruin Luna-crits, but this would be wasted.)

Gamble brings out the full potential

The activation rate is much higher when they have not capped luck. By comparison

The one big difference is that Luna-crit does not allow you to use Brave weapons


And so, 6 Avatars. There's better ways to get Luna-crit but I'm lazy. Preferably 3 Lethality-RK assassins and 6 Luna-crit Swordmasters. FeMU cannot access Luna-crit, but MaMU cannot get Inigo!Morgan, and Lethality-RK is generally stronger than Luna-Crit because of access to Brave weapons and their equivalents.

**Advance Wars mode**: For AW-style levels, for example, would grant his units a defense boost (like Reverse-Max), with a CO power that allows units to become invisible on non-road or city tiles, as if under fog of war. Lonqu would have luck-based passives similar to Nell to replicate crits, and a CO power that allows his units to have a possibility of attacking a second time. The list goes on. 

For this mode's version of FE levels, with a CO power that increases movement and criticals slightly. Meg is the Flak of this game and no one uses her, Valter's passives boost his units speed and grants them all a low % of using Pierce, with a CO power that grants them all Pierce for the round and boosts movement, etc. 

**Fire Emblem mode**: For FE levels, Max a fighter/warrior, Grit a sniper, Kanbei a hero, Andy a monk, etc. They have varying growths, though tend to be similar to Lords (i.e. good growths, all maps can be won either by seizing the castle or eliminating all enemy units. No escapes or other variety. 

For this mode's version AW-levels, Darros is a Cruiser, Ross a Battleship, Grit a boosted Rocket, etc. (boosts vary based on CO's normal focus or the character's growth rates from FE).

1363049077.0,1a48jt,[FE: A] Most Powerful Unit Possible?,baconboy9001,14,4,10,"I've been brainstorming
trying to create the most powerful unit possible :3

Vaike marries Cherche and creates super strong Gerome
(I'd go with MU cause he has one extra point in strength but that defeats the purpose)

Female MU with Str+/Mag- as her asset/flaw
HP - 80
Str - 61
Mag - 26
Skl - 44
Spd - 35
Lck - 45
Def - 55
Res - 31

Go through Dread Fighter first to give him Resistance +10
Pass down Galeforce from Female MU if you want
Then go ahead and give him the Limit Break skill

Now you're looking at:
HP - 80
Str - 71
Mag - 36
Skl - 54
Spd - 45
Lck - 55
Def - 65
Res - 41

So you`re going to be hitting twice often
Give him a forged Brave Axe with Mt 17. Put the rest in Hit rate cause 60 just isn't worthwhile at all.
Now, and also assuming the enemy has 0 defense,
with Aggressor in effect

Chances are, there's always Pavise and Aegis
You could replace Pavise or even Aegis cause it's pretty unnecessary now that I think about it. Stick in Axefaire for added effect and use Tomebreaker for the magic weakness.

ALSO
Marry him off to get a maximum of +9 in strength and defense. (Assuming you marry a female Wyvern Lord)
So with Axefaire, Aggressor, and Resistance +10, with a forged 17Mt Brave Axe,
the maximum damage you could deal in one battle is 448. :333333
Not accounting for Rallying

definitely doing this goodbye streetpass enemies.

Sorry for the wall of text

TL;DR: Create super Morgan that can do 448 damage.

Lucina Vs. Marth!

Ephraim Vs. Chrom!

**The Basics**  
Hello my fellow tacticians! I'm here to ~~start arguments~~ because I wanted to play out a what-if character VS battle scenario with our favorite lords! Sixteen heroes have been gathered and randomly put into a double-elimination style bracket.

Each matchup

***
**The Rules**  

1. Vote on who you think would win. Characters are assumed to be equal level in their most-promoted **canon class**. They also have access to any weapon they can wield in that class.  

2. Regular FE battle rules do not apply. No turn order

3. Give rationale for your choice! Explain why you think one character would best the other in the comments! This can be anything

4. You have roughly 24 hours from the time each round opens to vote before the next round begins.  

5. **PLEASE** don't cheat. One response per person

The laguz of previous games such as Path of Radiance work differently than the Taguel or the Manaketes of FE13. Instead of transforming before they attack

Every turn the laguz spends untransformed they gain +4 to the gauge

When they transform, the laguz reverts to its human form.

Lucina is probably one of the best child characters in the game. With access to a great selection of skills and a default parent with solid modifiers

Lucina gets +1 str, +1 luk, and -1 def and res from Chrom. A bunch of the important stuff with room to grow with your other parent's modifiers, so not too shabby on the max stats. You don't lose any of the important stuff either. 

She also has access to a GREAT selection of skills, she has access to the default class of cavalier, meaning she gets Aegis, which synergizes greatly with rightful king. It's even better if you give her a parent who has access to the general class, so she can get pavise, since her only other class options are from the rest of the cavalier class and the archer class. 

She has a fairly decent selection of parents: Sumia, Olivia, FMU, and some random village chick. Personally, I like Olivia, since you get 1 spd and 1 skill without losing out on some strength like you would if you used sully or sumia as Lucina's mother. You also get access to some great skills from the pegasus rider and myrmidon classes. The only issue is that you still have a limited class selection, but they are very strong classes. (but no access to Pavise!) Also, which is pretty good. 

She makes a great mother, too.

Overall, one of my favorite units. USE HER. She's awesome.

In case you missed it

**Class Discussion Thread: Warrior**

The Warrior Class is a promotion of the Fighter and Barbarian Classes. They are able to wield Axes and Bows. Stat wise, they have the second highest Strength cap (without modifiers) in FE13, only falling behind Generals and Berserkers. (Warriors have 48, while the two have 50) However, they aren't as tanky as generals or do much damage as Berserkers, making them a middle ground class used because they can tank while still dealing a respectable amount of damage.

Warriors learn two skills: Rally Strength

Rally Strength is a skill that they learn at level five. It gives +4 to Strength to all allies within a 3 tile radius for one turn. It's not very useful unless you really need that bonus strength to kill a unit and you're out of range to attack, since they have a pretty good strength rating. 

Their other skill is Counter, enemies must still be wary of attacking warriors. (And how many times have we accidentally killed our units in story mode when we didn't realize a warrior had counter?) In order to balance this skill out in story mode, when any units get last hit by counter, no experience is gained by the unit. You will only receive the normal exp for attacking a unit if you attack the unit before you kill them with counter.

Counter serves to make the warrior a very dangerous class to deal with, or Lifetaker also help a lot against counter.

How do you guys run your warriors? Why warriors over Heroes and Swordsmasters? What skills or changes would make this class stronger? What's weak/strong about this class?

1361143226.0,18pt6p,FEH's Guide to Success in Fire Emblem: Awakening's Lunatic Mode and Seals Guide,FireEmblemHelper,16,8,26,"Hey guys

Fire Emblem: Awakening's Lunatic mode begins with a burst and a bit of a bang. The Premonition level is really easy

* You will have to learn to think really well outside of the box. Insane strategies will become a thing to try and master here.

*  To succeed in Lunatic Mode

* Always pair up.

* Try and make sure that My Unit has speed spec. I'll go into that later.

* Learn to abuse and love the fact that you can view the ranges that enemies have. This is of the utmost importance.

* Most importantly

* Be patient! If you get wrecked after a while for too long

* Important: BE WARY of the difficulty gap from Hard to here. I see new players go and brag and say, etc, with different variations. Lunatic is a huge step up in difficulty from hard. Hard was a faceroll that I beat in two days where I solo'd half the levels with the lords and MU. Lunatic requires a lot more analytical thinking and care because ONE misstep can end the stage quickly!

So now

Prologue

* The Prologue gives you access to Chrom, and My Unit (MU). Pair Lissa with Frederick (calling him Freddy now) and trade the vulnerary to him. Move him to kill the reachable Myrmi/Merc (crap I forgot) that's behind the partition thing. Pair Chrom and MU together. End turn, and then two ruffian dudes will attack Freddy and he will almost kill both of them, and a mercenary will run around and approach MU and Chrom. Have Freddy kill the mercenary dude approaching, and then have MU kill one of the ruffians. A lone mage dude is gonna start his approach down, and on the next phase, you're gonna need to kill him fast, heal your guys all up, have MU grab some kills if possible. Boss strategy: have Fred sit next to him, with almost 80% into level 4. 

Chapter 1

* The general strategy here is to have Freddy do most of the damage, with Freddy dancing the spaces between the two fortresses. The hammer unit is a fat dick, and make sure Freddy has a Bronze Sword to counter him, and if possible, remain on a tree panel or a fort. Kill the hammer guy and the stage is really easy. Boss has a ranged attack, so continue moving the party train around the edges, and dance Freddy around the forts. Boss dies easily. The hammer is the huge problem. NEXT CHAPTER!

* NOTE: If you decide to pair MU with Freddy at some point

Chapter 2

* Okay, move Chrom to the east side of the safe zone. Put Vaike in the bottom center of the safe zone. My unit is top center. Move Lissa/Stahl to the bottom left. Before you do though. She should be ahead of MU. Bring Freddy and position him one slot left of her, and two slots up. The plan here now is to keep Freddy healthy and dance the bottom group over towards him, while running the other guys right and upwards. After two or three turns, most of the map should be wiped out. Freddy will deviate towards the Northwest of the bottom half of the map, and the others will move right and up. Once bottom half is down, rest is easy. Watch Fred's life, and sparingly use Elixirs. TRY not to though. They are vital

Chapter 3

* This one isn't bad. Give Fred the iron axe that Vaike has. Pair them together, you move upwards, and towards the boss. Trade the Javelin from Kellam to Freddy at first chance. Will be useful. Trust me. Rinse, repeat phases, staying aware of the enemies and their ranges. Pretty easy and straightforward.

Chapter 4

* Easy chapter. I basically ended up solo running with MU and Freddy. The Silver Lance proves vital because it ends up popping the mages in one hit LOL. Keep aware of the ranges, though it's not important as after this chapter raising him becomes laughable. 

Post-Chapter 4:

* You get the Outrealm Gate. Purchase the stage the Golden Gaffe, play Xenologues 1: Champions of Yore. Bottom line: you pay $2.50 and you get infinite farming potential. I am surprised they didn't limit it!

Now


* After excessive farming on the DLC levels and chapters

* The other seal to keep in mind is Second Seal, to RELEVEL THEM all over again, with no stat losses for the same class, and slight rebalancing for a different class. This can be used on unpromoted units at level 10+ and on promoted units at 10+. Easy, right? This system is infinite until you hit your wanted stat caps. Farm DLC for easy levels, rinse and repeat!

It's not like I didn't give Classic a good try. I went to Chapter 9, Miriel gets attacked and kills the attacker with her counter-attack leaving the square open again. Another attacker promptly comes up to her and attacks again, which she deftly counter-attacks killing him, again leaving the square open. To which a third attacker comes up and killing-blows her. 

Now I'm fine with strategy. I'm fine with planning things out, then I might strategically stay my hand to prevent a continuous line of death-suitors from banging away at me. But I don't have the choice and I'm compelled to reset and begin the 20 min battle over again. 

I like the *idea* of the permadeath.

Here's some background:

She's not a gamer in the traditional sense. She has a DSi that I bought her, as well as Just Dance on my Kinect. other than that; she doesn't play much. I also don't play games at all around her, time with her is dedicated to her. It's been almost five years now, and she realizes how much I love gaming and certain series, though doesn't quite understand. All the same, she smiles and supports it, and I appreciate that more than anything. (I don't rip on her for her Mob Wives/Real Housewives love subsequently. Only fair.)

Now, or to play when she's over. It just never seemed right to me. I've seen my brother go through 3 girlfriends in the same timespan I've been with mine. Each one sat on his bed and watched him play video games, and they'd occasionally talk/she'd play. Needless to say, all those relationships he's had have gone bye-bye. 

Anyways

Liz knew how much this release meant to me, and I refused. We're college students, and set strict limits on what we can spend for each-other. $50.00 at the absolute most. So after some deliberation, I agreed to let her help pay, since I'd already pre-ordered it. It bothers me she spent money on my obsession/habit, but It also makes me really happy she's so awesome about it too. I guess what really compelled me to come here is the way she presented the 50.00 to me. Not through just some check/cash, she sent me something special. The story is told by the Three pictures in the gallery linked at the end. 

I'm so excited this game is releasing, I think this will definitely get me through the week.

We got the game on release day and took up one file each. I started mine first, because as he said ""our bodies were not ready."") So I was alone in our living room, watching the first couple scenes, and Chrom reached out his hand to my fem-Sora-lookin' MU and then gazed into my soul with his beauteous eyes and captured my heart etc. I felt a little embarrassed at how thoroughly I swooned at this lord. But Jay had the same reaction (""le swoon"") so I felt a bit better.

So, lord babies for everyone, let's go.

Jay then beat several more chapters, he had inadvertently made me his time-paradox mother-in-law, and become increasingly uncomfortable with it as the game progressed. Big, tough, grown-ass man, with his woobie wife whose real mom (he didn't really accept Sumia as a real thing) was me. Made things awkward over doing the dishes. Jay's avatar, btw, but with brown hair

On his second playthrough, he ended up marrying the divine dragon and transcending time and space in the game, by getting an ending in which he lived forever as dragons with his dragon wife.  I was so proud :')

tl;dr: Because we both wanted to marry lords

We also had a friend playing the third file. He married Anna because SOMEONE had to see what was going on there, and Donnel. It was some dumb shit.

Hmm let me think of some more joint adventures...

Then we played Lunatic mode! We did it on casual because we wanted to minimize hating ourselves. He beat it and is now working on Lunatic+
SO, and people it with awkward time-paradoxical relationships. The person who suggested this thread wanted to hear about our own stories getting woven in with the game story, but I think most of the rest of it was creative support/skill breeding of second-gen monstrosities. Anyway, we do and always have had a tendency to think of what happens to these characters on the battlefield as part of their lives and relationships, so Awakening has been our favorite and most rewarding game by far.

Comparatively, Manaketes have much more strength and defense, making them a much tankier and slower. However, Manaketes also have The newfound ability to make ranged attacks, giving them a bit more versatility than Taguels. 

Let's talk about skills. Their level five skills (even and odd rhythm) are fairly similar and boring skills, more niche skill. Only effective against other dragons, which is good for streetpass, but even so that's only good if they have another manakete on their team. However, beastbane is much more powerful, amplifying the taguel's already impressive damage against beast type units such as paladins and great knights. Also, they have the speed to take advantage of this skill

Overall, I'd give either sol, lifetaker, or renewal since they lack sustainability and aren't as tanky as manaketes. Also, lancebreaker to counteract beastbanes.

However, don't ignore the Manakete. With their ridiculous defense and resistance, as well as ranged capabilities, noone will want to attack it with anything short of a wyrmslayer. However, since they lack in speed I'd advise giving them Astra. Manaketes have ~40 skill, so they'll be able to take advantage of it. Also, Astra is even better on them because of their high amount of strength and their ranged attack. Also, and aegis and pavise just to make them ridiculously tanky.
