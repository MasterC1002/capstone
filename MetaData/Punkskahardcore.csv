I'm a 5'5"" relatively small and fairly socially awkward thirteen year old girl

I decided it'd be a good idea to come as soon as the doors opened and stand as close as I could to the stage so I could admire Jeff Rosenstock's enthusiasm as closely as possible. And also I think he's kind of cute. I stood there for about an hour, then for about four minutes after that until a mosh pit was started

I'll admit I didn't really think through how I expected the concert to unfold

My sister always told me to avoid mosh pits when I go to concerts but I didn't even really know ""mosh pit"" meant until I was being knocked around in one

But while I was trying to navigate a route to the back of the room so I could actually hear the band play instead of the ringing in my ears from the incredibly loud speaker, just so I could help someone up if I had the chance, and having the reassurance someone would help me up if they had the chance too

I found a place by the wall a little ways back into the room with the rest of the people uninterested in moshing instead. I shouted along to some of my favorite songs

And that's the end of my long tale about my first punk show. I'll probably hold off trying to get a good view of the stage until I'm a little older

So yeah. Anything else I should know about punk/ska/general concerts before I attempt to go to another?

And the rallies at Nuremburg
The ritual serves in conjunction
With what everybody knows is
I'm just appealing to your sense of fair play

When I say she's puzzled by
This incessant pressure for her to not defy
Collective will and yellow-ribboned lapels
As the soldiers inexplicably repel

If I didn't sense some spiritual connection
We may not be the same but it's not like we're from different planets
We both love this game so much we can hardly fucking stand it

Ain't a sheet of ice north of Fargo I ain't played
From Penhold to the Gatineau
Every fond memory of childhood that I know

Is somehow connected to the culture of
This game

I guess it comes down to
What kind of world you want to live in
Diversity is disagreement
Well

A strange and bitter fruit that that sad old man beside you
Keeps feeding to young minds as virtue
It takes a village to raise a child
Until they're nothing more than ballast for fulfilling

Of a paradise

We post punk stories that range from [fun facts](http://dyingscene.com/news/fun-factoid-friday-tom-gabel-against-me-has-a-talented-wife/) to In addition, [band features,](http://dyingscene.com/news/band-spotlight-the-bastard-suns/) [album](http://dyingscene.com/news/flogging-molly-set-release-date-for-new-album-speed-of-darkness-offer-presale/) and [tour](http://dyingscene.com/news/nofx-teenage-bottlerocket-old-man-markley-announce-canadian-tour-dates/) updates, free music, and much more.
