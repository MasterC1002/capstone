It was the first attempt with the cheap wood bit. The result was better than expected.

Could I carve out a groove in the design I want and simply hammer in a brass wire into the groove?

Would you imagine brass as the best option for an inlay that would last

the shaft has a very gentle taper (but does have a 0.5"" groove machined

It's not a precision part; as long as I can get somewhat close to the original specs, drill press, and bench grinder, plus all of the regular hand tools.

I also need to drill a 1.5"" hole in the exact center of a 18"" disk. I can find the center and use a hole saw

I have access to a large Jet drill press/end mill as well as drill bits and some end mills. I will probably get a rotary table off of eBay and a chuck I can use on the either the rotary table or on the mill's table. 

I'll probably need to get a tool for centering the pipe under the drill head. Do I need to get a boring bar and head or can I just use an end mill and rotary table? can I use a 5/8 drill bit for the smaller hole.

Sorry guys, throwaway for reasons that will become clear soon.

So. I want to get my boyfriend an engagement ring (I'm a girl). The plan is that he is going to propose to me

When we were scooting around jewelry stores, I know, but I could *really* tell he thought they were neat. He's sort of an antsy guy, likes to have something to do with his hands when he's thinking; he's also very utilitarian, so I know that he thinks if he's gotta have a ring it might as well be sorta useful for something. I know he would love something like this.

So on to my question: Is it reasonable to expect that I could find a durable one one of these that would last as a wedding ring? Meaning wearing it every day, but I wanted someone's opinion who knows what they are doing. 

Could I theoretically find one in a jewelry store, so that one fails, I was thinking about an option two:

A puzzle ring. You know the kind, it's in a much better style, but it would cost over $1.5k. Really? Yikes! That's probably as much as he's going to spend on my ring, and I'm not even out of college so that's completely not an option for me. I was hoping something along the lines of non-precious metals, no more than $500. 

So if I'm going the route of the puzzle ring

- I'll explain why a Bridgeport is not an option.  Not only is space an issue
- The biggest stand alone mill I could fit in my shop would be a Grizzly G0619.  Even then
- I like buying used
- It will be for hobby use only.  I'm not going to try to make any money with it.  
- I plan to do 1 project at a time
- The granite has a 21 speed quick change gear box and a variable speed DC motor.  This seems to be a major benefit since the other hobby lathes in the class have at best a 9 speed gear box if any.  Since my parts will be one off
- The granite has power feed
- A milling attachment is available for some lathes like the Precision Matthews PM1127VF, there's no fine feed on the X (Long) axis.
- I'm worried about small importers like Precision Matthews

As for projects, a 2 axis remote control SLR camera mount, and parts for my wood working tools.

1341957027.0,wcmon,Approached Etsy metalworker for custom steel bar project- want to know your thoughts!,fluxionz,7,2,17,"Hey folks, are:  

* is this project doable within reason? Are the angles too difficult to execute?
   
* Would crafting a steel bar top as designed be very expensive? Should I resolve to use a wooden bar-top? What would you charge? 

* What information would be helpful to provide to the craftsman?  
 
* Any other thoughts that might not occur to me


And finally- if there is any interest

Cheers all! And thanks in advance for anyone's comments :)  


&gt;Hello Lee

&gt;I've done my best to articulate the design with the following diagrams- a few notes (I apologize in advance for inundating you with such a long message!)

&gt;Album: http://imgur.com/a/ckmIs

&gt;* The space we're planning to put the bar in is irregularly shaped, everything (including the wood floor panels) is aligned with the left wall, so the diagonal wall throws it all off. Hence the need to keep everything still in proper orientation! :) The sharper, right-hand side of the bar is not ideal...but I can't think of a better way to resolve the loose end. The right side of the bar enters the living room.  

&gt;* Because everything is so oddly shaped, could you provide a quote for a wooden bar top, as well as a steel bar top?  

&gt;* I was hoping for metal with a dark, and industrial. Our home has a fair number of items from Room and Board with their 1.5"" black steel legs (such as their Parsons desks)- so I'd love to keep loosely in theme. :)  

&gt;* The design was originally inspired by the first image in the album. We'd been meaning to have a custom table made, is a sleeker look- we don't want the icebox to sit atop the table, but rather to sit in a depression, on a lip. We could then have a cover crafted to sit flush with the bar top, when the boxes are not in use.  

&gt;* The bar would need a sheet of metal on the back to secure it to the wall (bolted in)-  this doesn't have to be as large as indicated

&gt;* The inset boxes would primarily be used to hold ice, yakitori grill. Lets say, about 2 inches from the bottom of the box, in each of the four corners, you were to affix a bead of metal, such that a grate could rest on the beads, and stand elevated 2 inches from the bottom of the box. We'd use this grate to hold smokeless charcoal, so I am not concerned about ventilation)  

&gt;I think that covers it all- and well, unfortunately I know nothing about welding :( Our budget is pretty broad, but we are trying to avoid a huge expenditure because I doubt we'll be living in this apartment much longer than another 5 years or so.

1356179332.0,15a0ua,Planning to make engagement ring. Hit a wall.,xylidylproject,1,0,1,"I want to make the engagement ring I'll give my SO and have settled on lost wax casting as it seems to be easier and i would be able to make more intricate designs with overall less tools and skill. I hoped to start with making a great many pieces in bronze then later some sterling silver and finally with gold for the engagement ring. Making the wax rings seems straight forward enough and i have few concerns about this step. 

As for making the cast, long pants and a face shield when handling the metal.

Now here's the wall. I was trying to find out how i would melt the metal and read that i can melt a couple of ounces of silver with a butane or propane torch

So i suppose i want to know just how can i melt the metal? Also will the plan so far work and is it even safe? I'm very keen on this idea and don't want to give it up easily.

TL DR: Want to make an engagement ring but can't figure out how to melt the metal.

It has 2 valves: one to control the air intake (on top) and one to control the butane gas intake on the side.

I know that in theory I should supply more air for more temperature but I'm not sure how this translates to a handheld torch. 

Sliding the airvalve all the way to the left gives me a nice blue jet flame. Does this mean the airvalve is open completely?

Sliding the airvalve all the way to the right gives me a yellowish regular lighter flame. Does this mean the airvalve is closed completely?

Sliding the gas valve just seems to increase and decrease the size of the flame.

I am left wondering what position the valves should have for maximum and minimum temperature. Can anyone offer some helpful information?",,t5_2qkuc,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/metalworking/comments/wr8zj/i_have_a_butane_minitorch_with_adjustable_air_and/

Ive sanded off the anodised aluminium colour off, and probably given myself alu. poisoning in the process.

I cant get any closer to that elusive mirror finish though. My local hardware store doesnt have any specific alu. polish (the netherlands). Silver polish doesnt seem to work great; takes off alot of material. Have another chrome polish

I have a CAD program (Autodesk 123d) and I'm trying to make a metal yoyo.


Yoyos have changed considerably in the past few years. The wooden toys you guys might remember have changed into high precision

The project I have been working on is pretty simple:

1.Use CAD and design a yoyo.
2.Go to a local machinist and have him/her make me a run of about 50-100 yoyos
3.Have them anodized by an anodizer.
4.Sell them to other hobbyists.

Although price varies

The outer diameter of this yoyo will be anywhere from 50mm to 56mm
The weight will be 64-68grams.

The yoyos are machined one half at a time. Therefore,and a bearing. 


This is where the question comes in. 

I am aware that lots of factors can change the price, so that's 200 halves. I want it made on a lathe, and not a mill. I don't really care for anodization and other things, but I want just the price for machining+base price for the metal (6061 aluminum). I just want a ballpark estimate of how much that would cost before I go out and bug my local machinist. Tell me what other factors I need to include if needed. Thanks!
