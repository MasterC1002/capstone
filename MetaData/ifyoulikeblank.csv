The show does have a laugh track, he/she has to deal with an egotistical star and is frequently observed and advised by a wealthy corporate superior. Both shows also have a pretty frenetic pace, which I assume is endemic to their respective settings. And if that ain't enough, *30 Rock* [was originally intended to be about a news show as well](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/30_Rock#Conception).

The comparison to *Community* is because the show takes a pretty great amount of care in avoiding common sitcom cliches

I've seen a lot of these listed, I added links to Netflix (*) for the titles available to stream in the US, otherwise they're linked to IMDB for the movies, Amazon for the books, Steam for the games (Wiki's for the ones not on Steam) and Music is linked to whatever album is available album on YouTube. I'll add to the list if/when other people chime in, otherwise this is more than enough to get someone started and kept busy for quite a while.

[Lights - Cactus in the Valley(Itunes session)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETS4L1S4v1w) - Debated putting this one here.  It is the lyrics/singing more so than the rest of the music that does it for me.

[The Weeknd - Wicked Games](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9PuAm7d0PA) - I like this one a lot

**[edIT - Dex](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWemXNsSl10)** - This entire album has long been one of my all time favorites.  

I know a lot these are pretty wildly different from each other

Before the set started the members of the band was DJing the venue for several hours, music you could imagine played in some stereotypical bar or truckstop in Alaska. Think Jack London, some black metal, mostly acoustic (don't limit yourselves though).

I know this is pretty vague

EDIT:
Wow
UNFORTUNATELY, though plenty of it is very nice music in its own right and some of it has been kind of in the right direction. I realize that it's very hard to explain a certain mood one is after and that it's always going to be highly subjective what constitutes ""dark/atmospheric"". Having spent some more time thinking about what I'm actually after, I realize that my original explanation might have been somewhat lacking in conveying what I'm really looking for.

I want the music to be gritty and simply processed. Imagine an old, the air inside heavy with the smell of woodsmoke and tobacco. Imagine fur coated people sitting around a fire in the wintry forest of canada, playing moody tunes on fiddle and banjo, maybe with some occasional chanting for good measure. I want it to be rough and unprocessed and rural.

Fry and Laurie

Game Of Thrones

Generation Kill

Homeland

House of Cards

House of Lies

Justified

Life's Too Short

Lost - hell of a journey.

Louie*

Luther

Mad Men

Misfits - Quit after season 3 to many cast changes worth a watch until that point though.

Orange Is The New Black

Rome

Sons of Anarchy

Shameless US version

Sherlock

Spaced

The Hour

The IT Crowd

The Killing

The Newsroom - finished the first season

The United States Of Tara

The West Wing - Starting season 7

The Walking Dead

Top Of The Lake

The Avalanches have traditionally been described as a band that uses sampling a lot.

What I liked about Since I left you was that in addition to being ratehr original in its musical style, dance music and jazz.

For me, and I wonder if any of you guys here know any other albums that are of similar style? Both on the musical style, and also being cohesive and atmospheric as an album. I feel like many albums either don't go anywhere but just meander around (Endtroducing) or are too hyperactive and miss the marks on the pacing (Carpal Tunnel Syndrome).

For reference

* DJ Shadow - Endtroducing (pretty nice
* Kid Koala - Carpal Tunnel Syndrome (hyper-active)
* J Dilla - Donuts (meandering)

Riddles that you can't solve simply by clicking around and hoping something happens but you have to observe and think and suddenly it all falls into place. I hope you catch the drift.

I already tried the first parts of Syberia and The Longest Journey (Dreamfall) but tbh neither had this sort of experience (a little too much ""use random objects to find the damn key somewhere"" and ""talk to people and just do what they tell you"").

The entire [Criterion Collection](http://www.hulu.com/movies/criterion) is available on Hulu for free this weekend and I've only seen a few of them.

I'm getting together with a friend tomorrow night to watch a bunch but when I tried to put together a queue of movies I'm interested in I ended up with a list of 64. Help!

He's a big fan of film noir with sharp dialogue and various old movies. I have a fondness for modern French films of any kind and comedies.  We both like sci-fi and horror films but are pretty much open to anything.  

Some random (maybe helpful) facts:

* We're both Murakami and Vonnegut fans when it comes to literature. Had been considering My Life as a Dog since I read it was Vonnegut's favorite movie.
* I've seen one Goddard film but got slightly bored and turned it off.  I don't remember which one
* We're both music nuts.
